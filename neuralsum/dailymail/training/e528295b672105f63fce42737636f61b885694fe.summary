a suit that promises to tell how hard you ’ve work – or have n’t – has been developed by two students in @entity10			0
named ‘ @entity12 ’ , the full - body suit is equipped with tiny sensors that measure muscle output , heart rate and respiration			1
the data is transmitted into a credit card - sized module called ' the core ' that wirelessly syncs with an @entity12 software app the @entity12 suit is embedded with tiny sensors that are able to measure a wearer 's muscle output , heart rate and breathing rate			1
the data provides users with a ' muscle effort ' score so they know how much they are pushing themselves			2
at the same time , heart rate activity is registered so that users can get into the right heart rate zone to improve fitness			1
the sensors ensure the users have balance by providing data on whether they are stretching and lifting evenly			1
it will also track their reps and time spent working out			1
as the wearer moves , electrical activity can be measured on the skin			1
this is then is converted into useful performance data			0
the data is transmitted into a credit card - sized module called ‘ @entity46 ’ that wirelessly syncs with an @entity12 software app. the app collects the information and gives users a way to track and understand their workouts			1
for instance the data provides users with a ' muscle effort ' score so they know how much they are pushing themselves			2
at the same time , heart rate activity is registered so that users can get into the right heart rate zone to improve fitness			2

@entity67 students @entity68 and @entity70 created the suit after being frustrated by their exercise routine			0
unable to afford a personal trainer , the electrical engineers put their heads together to come up with a way to get comprehensive data from their muscles as they worked out			2
up until now , measuring expended energy had required using small adhesive patches stuck all over the body			0
the @entity12 suit , however , has sensors embedded in the compression suit fabric and does n’t require any adhesives			1
‘ we 've done extensive testing on very sweaty athletes and the sensors perform beautifully , ’ said the creators			0
@entity67 students @entity68 and @entity70 created the suit after being frustrated by their exercise routine @entity12 has been backed with $ 3.5 million in seed funding from @entity92 's @entity91			2
any piece of @entity12 clothing will set you back $ 99 ( £ 60 ) , and you ’ll need another $ 199 ( £ 121 ) for a core			0
‘ at launch we 're planning to support any @entity100 device that is running @entity101 and has @entity102 , ’ they added			0
‘ right now that means we support the @entity104 and later , @entity106 3 and later , @entity105 5 , ipad mini			0
’ the first version , due for launch early next year , will have 14 muscle sensors and one pair for heart rate and breathing .			0

the @entity12 suit uses tiny sensors to measure data for up to 14 muscles
as wearer moves , electrical activity from muscles is measured on the skin
as well as this , respiration , balance , reps and rest - time are measured
data is sent from the suit to a *mobile* app to help users track their workouts
