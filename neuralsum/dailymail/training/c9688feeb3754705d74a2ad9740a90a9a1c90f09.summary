@entity0 struggled to find just eight models that were healthy enough to appear in her show it should have been the proudest moment of my year			1
yet as i watched eight models wearing my designs stride down the spotlight - studded catwalk at the @entity8 in @entity9 on tuesday – the final day of @entity10 – i was troubled by a dark and deeply disturbing memory			1
just three weeks earlier , i had held my first casting session – and almost every girl who attended was devastatingly thin and looked severely malnourished			1
it was the first time in my 22 years as a fashion designer that i had struggled to find just eight models who looked healthy and shapely enough to appear in my annual catwalk show			1
the parade of jutting spines , protruding hipbones , flat chests and wasted muscles on casting day was achingly sad			2
one girl was so determined to win a space on my catwalk that she layered on three pairs of tights in a desperate attempt to make her legs appear less stick - like			2
many of the girls wore heavily - padded bras , some with fillets inserted , to give the semblance of shape to their flat chests – though they were quickly found out as i measure the models in their underwear to check that their actual measurements tally with what they claim			1
yet even more disturbing are the legions of girls who do n’t try to disguise their skeletal frames at all			2
why ? because they believe that this is what the fashion world expects of them			2
and then came the final straw			2
i was utterly flabbergasted when my slim and beautiful 15 - year - old daughter @entity54 turned to me and said , ‘ i ’m going on a diet , mum because i want to be a model			2
’ what ’s concerning is that @entity54 , like many girls her age , believes that the models are the essence of glamour			1
@entity64 thinks that @entity66 's decision to ban all models with a @entity68 under 18.5 is a move in the right direction it worries me sick , the idea that she would get eating disorders or not eat correctly with the desire to be this size and look as stick thin as her idols			1
in reality , i ask modelling agencies to only send girls to castings if they meet my strict criteria : they must be a healthy - looking girl of 23 to 26 years old			1
she should measure 5ft9 in height but above all , she must be no smaller than a size 9			2
in other words , a small size 10			2
usually , it takes two casting sessions to find eight suitable models who fit this criteria			1
yet this year , i found only two suitable models in my first session – and none at all in my second casting session			1
quite simply , they were all too thin			2
panic stricken , i called a third casting session			2
then a fourth , and a fifth			2
by monday – just one day before the show – i was still scrambling around to find an eighth girl			1
finally , a beautiful girl walked in whom i was determined to book			2
she had olive skin , blue eyes , she was very pretty and had a lovely toned figure with a 26 - inch waist			2
‘ you ’ve got a fabulous figure , you ’re perfect			0
this is great , ’ i told her			0
but her reply was shattering			0
she admitted , ‘ i visited a modelling agency a few days ago and asked them to represent me			0
they told me they would only accept me if i lost five kilos			0
’ @entity0 thinks that models such as @entity118 ( left ) and @entity119 ( right ) had the right look @entity0 thinks that models today , such as @entity122 ( left ) and @entity123 ( right ) do not have the same healthy figures as those in the eighties in truth , she did n’t need to lose a pound			1
had she done so , she would have looked awful			0
i asked what she had said to the agency and was relieved to learn that she had told them their agency was n’t for her			0
but for every one of her , there are fifty models who would buckle under the pressure and instantly shed the kilos , desperate to find work in this increasingly - crowded industry			1
though models have always been considered thin , there is now an unhealthy and unspoken requirement that they must be a minuscule @entity147 size 2 , 4 or 6			1
in other words , stick thin twiglets with no breasts , no hips , very little waistline and certainly no womanly shape			0
as recently as two years ago , this was n’t the case			0
in my 2011 catwalk show , i hired the most fabulous - looking girl with a gorgeous size - 9 shape			0
i did n’t bother asking her to a casting session in 2012 and booked her again without seeing her			0
yet when she arrived , i was horrified			0
in one year , she had shrunk from shapely to emaciated			0
her knees were knobbly bones and her legs were the thickness of my arms			0
in total , she had lost two and a half stone			0
why did she do it ? because her agent advised it would allow her more work			0
@entity0 said that womanly models , like @entity173 , pictured , were rare in modern fashion what ’s ironic is that beautiful as she is , i have never employed her since			1
because the clothes were dropping off her , we have to pull them to pieces and refit them			0
my parting warning to her was : do n’t let this industry ruin you			0
@entity122 , @entity184 , @entity123 and the it - models of today have vastly different shapes to the shapely supermodels of the @entity188 , when @entity118 , @entity189 , @entity119 graced the pages of @entity191 – and when i launched my first fashion line			1
named survival kit , it was a range of active sportswear stocked in @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 and never once was it difficult to cast an advertising shoot as there was an abundance of exercised , toned , healthy - looking models at that time			1
this was still the case in 1991 when i opened my first boutique selling couture bridal gowns and evening dresses in @entity209 , @entity210			0
@entity211 pioneered the waif look in the 1990 's even by 1995 , as i collaborated with @entity214 on a line of bridal gowns , there was still no shortage of women fitting this criteria			1
yet today , womanly - looking models such as @entity220 and @entity173 are rarities , outnumbered by the masses of bone - thin girls			1
what ’s changed is n’t just down to fashion or the era of waif look , paved by @entity211 in the mid- 1990s			1
in fact , the entire culture of modelling has altered and with it , the model ’s shapes			0
first , this is because models travel all the time : whilst in the @entity188 most girls working in @entity147 were @entity147 , today very few are			1
models drop into @entity239 for one month , to @entity240 for another , and many hail from @entity243			1
such a transient and highly - stressful lifestyle leaves little time for exercise and muscle - toning , and so thinness is instead attained by food – or lack thereof			0
fashion designers also play a part : many find it far easier to cast ‘ coathanger ’ models in their runway shows			1
because they ‘ hang ’ clothes instead of wearing them , they do n’t require as many time - consuming fittings and redesigns			0
this is perhaps why the average model who walked at @entity10 was barely size 2 to 4			0
she likely had a 22 - inch waist , a size 31 bust , no hips – which is very , very small for a 5ft9 woman			0
amazing measures are being taken in @entity66 – models with a @entity68 of less than 18.5 have been banned			1
this should n’t just be celebrated , it should be common sense			0
anything less is dangerous , and designers should have a duty of care to encourage models – their employees – to be slim rather than skinny , fit , well - toned , with great muscles and an aura of healthiness			1
in short , to be woman			0
which is a vastly more attractive sight than a miserable , malnourished and emaciated teenage waif			0
@entity64 ’s 2014 evening , event wear and bridal collection now available at @entity288			1

designer @entity64 found it hard to find eight healthy models
she thinks that models have changed since those in the eighties
she *supports* @entity66 's move to ban models with a @entity68 under 18.5
