if you ’re rarely without your smartphone , then chances are that it ’s teeming with bacteria - as seen in this collection of alarming photos			1
in many cases , this bacteria is relatively harmless and comes from touching unclean surfaces or not washing your hands properly			0
but in others , the bacteria found can lead to infections such as food poisoning , impetigo and even septicaemia			1
after three days , they studied the bacteria that had grown in the dishes to study the level of dirt on a person ’s phone , students studying bacteriology at the @entity21 imprinted their mobile phones on to so - called ‘ bacterial growth medium ’ in @entity35 dishes			1
after three days , they studied the bacteria that had grown in the dishes - and were shocked by what they discovered			1
staphylococcus aureus : it is thought that 20 % of people are long - term carriers of the bug , which often lurks inside nasal passages			0
many healthy people carry it on their skin and in their noses without getting sick			0
but when skin is punctured or broken , staph bacteria can enter the wound and cause infections			1
it is a common cause of staph infections including food poisoning , impetigo and even septicaemia			1
bacillus mycoides : this bacteria is typically found in soil , which suggests the phone or its user had been in contact with soil recently			1
bacillus mycoides are found in common pesticides and are used to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria and fungi			2
on a number of occasions , the disease - carrying bacteria @entity39 was discovered			1
it is thought that 20 per cent of people are long - term carriers of the bug , which often lurks inside the nasal passages			0

and @entity93 bacteria can easily spread through contaminated surfaces and from person to person			0
another bacteria spotted was bacillus mycoides			0

it is a common cause of staph infections including food poisoning , impetigo and even septicaemia the experiment forms part of the course work for dr @entity138 ’s @entity137 course			1
each year , dr @entity140 asks his students to imprint their phones , and this collection of images are from the most recent experiment			2
the average handset carries 18 times more potentially harmful germs than a flush handle in a men 's toilet , recent tests revealed			0
an analysis of handsets found almost a quarter were so dirty that they had up to ten times an acceptable level of bacteria			2
one of the phones in the test had such high levels of bacteria it could have given its owner a serious stomach upset			2
the findings from a sample of 30 phones by which ? magazine suggest 14.7million of the 63million mobiles in use in the @entity170 today could be potential health hazards			0
dr @entity140 said : ' it seems that the mobile phone does n’t just remember telephone numbers , but also harbours a history of our personal and physical contacts such as other people , soil and other matter ' ' as part of [ the course ] i get the students to imprint their mobile phones on to bacteriological growth @entity35 dishes so that we might determine what they might carry			1
' it 's unusual , but a very effective way of engaging our students with the often overlooked microbiology of everyday life			0
' the ecological niche on the body for @entity39 is the nostrils , so a furtive pick of the nose , and quick text after , and you end up with this pathogen on your smartphone			0

students imprinted phones in @entity35 dishes with ' bacterial growth medium ’
after three days , they studied the bacteria that had grown in the dishes
students found levels of disease - carrying bacteria @entity39
this is a cause of staph infections including food poisoning and impetigo
others contained bacterium called @entity275 typically found in soil
