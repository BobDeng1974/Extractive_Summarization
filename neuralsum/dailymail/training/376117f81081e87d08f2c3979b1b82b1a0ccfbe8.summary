@entity1 batsman @entity0 caused a mild scare in @entity3 when he ducked into a bouncer and was hit on the head against @entity6			1
@entity0 , 24 , wore the delivery from @entity8 on his helmet and after the impact of the ball players from both sides rushed to see if he was ok			1
fortunately the @entity1 no 3 was fine and seemed more sheepish about the way he played the delivery			0
@entity0 's helmet is inspected by opposition fielder @entity17 after the batsman was hit on the head the players and umpires gather round to check whether @entity0 ( front centre ) is ok @entity23 places his hand on the opposing batsman 's head as both sides show their concern there was relief all around the @entity32 ground , especially in light of the death of @entity36 ' death two weeks ago			2
the left - hander died at the age of 25 after being hit by a short delivery from @entity40 and he has been mourned during @entity1 's first test against @entity42 this week			1
@entity0 went on to make just 18 but in the ground they were just happy that he continued batting			0
his team - mate @entity45 was also in the wars , being hit on the head by a fielder 's throw			0
@entity8 and @entity50 check on @entity45 after he was hit in the head by a throw @entity36 , who died two weeks ago , is remembered via his @entity53 cap number 408 in @entity54			0

@entity0 ducks into short delivery from @entity8
