by @entity0 published : 08:06 est , 9 november 2012 updated : 12:18 est , 9 november 2012 a baby elephant was rescued with just minutes to spare after spending over 12 hours stuck in a mudpool			1
the young bull was spotted with mud up to its neck by a group of tourists on safari along the @entity9 in @entity10			1
when the rescue team arrived it became apparent that they needed to act quickly as the baby pachyderm struggled to free its trunk and was close to drowning			2
mud - dled up : the young elephant was spotted sinking into the marshland by tourists on safari along the @entity9 in @entity10 @entity23 and his wife @entity24 , owners of the nearby @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity19 heard the call for help over the radio and immediately came to the aid of the young elephant			1
after gathering a rescue team , they made several attempts to pull it from the mud before eventually setting it free			2
mr @entity23 said it was likely the elephant had become trapped the evening before and after surviving for more than 12 hours would n't have lasted much longer			1
he said : ' elephants are particularly drawn to these areas and when moving towards the luscious vegetation they become stuck and sink deep into the mud , causing them to dehydrate and loose blood circulation to their legs			1
' sticky situation : the baby elephant was found after 12 hours , stuck with mud up to his neck mission begins : @entity23 helps tie the ropes around the elephant 's neck after wetting the mud lifesavers : when the rope is secured , the team begins to pull the five - year - old bull elephant out of the mud ' if they 're not found these animals will eventually die or be eaten alive by vultures , hyenas or any other predator that may be drawn to the petrified screams and bellows for help			1
' when we arrived on the scene it was apparent that the young elephant had been trapped in the early hours of the evening before			2
' amazingly he survived at least twelve and a half hours of this tragedy before being seen			2
battle : the elephant is fighting to get out of the mudpool as the rescue team pulls him by the neck one - two - three - pull : it took an entire team to turn the elephant around in the mud before they could attach the ropes to a car desperate : the poor creature fought for his life but struggled to summon the energy after 12 hours in the mud the @entity86 and their recovery team used 200 litres of water to cool the baby elephant and to soften the mud which had begun to harden under the hot sun. ' we also had to soften the mud that surrounded him in order to pull him gently without damaging his legs as they were well trapped by fast drying clay			1
' initially we could n't use the car as the elephant was facing the wrong direction and by pulling him backwards we risked a chance of injury to the young bull			0
' we had to pull him by hand for the first part of the ordeal so we could shift his weight and have him facing the vehicle for an easier recovery			0
' reward : @entity24 and @entity23 try to motivate the elephant to make one last push by offering it treats nearly there : motivated by the nuts in @entity24 's hand , the baby elephant managed to get its leg unstuck a shower in my mud bath : @entity124 is washed from the elephant 's face and eyes by throwing water over it finally out : stretching its legs the elephant is a big shaky - but safe ' the only safe place to put the rope is around his neck			1
elephants have a very strong neck that can take a lot of strain			0
if we had tried to pull him out by any part of his legs which eventually become exposed , we risked breaking them			0
' when he was finally free and lay on the solid ground we had to act fast and get him to his feet , to allow the blood to circulate			0
' towing straps were placed under his belly and with our team off staff we heaved him to his feet manually			0
' so far the baby is doing well and although he is very young he is able to look after himself			0
' we are keeping an eye on him though to make sure he does n't get into any more sticky situations			0
