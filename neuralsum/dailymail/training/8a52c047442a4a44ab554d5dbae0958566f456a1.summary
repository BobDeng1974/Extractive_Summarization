by @entity0 he 's worked at five star restaurants and cooks for celebrities every weekend on the @entity6 's @entity5 but now @entity7 has a different target market - dogs			1
the chef has teamed up with vet and animal nutritionist @entity10 to create some canine cordon bleu for man 's best friend			1
and while the dishes , including sweet potato and white fish bake and cheese and kale frittata , might sound elaborate , the accompanying videos reveal that they can be prepared in minutes			1
@entity7 , who owns two dogs himself , said this is a much better alternative than giving your dog your leftover pizza or curry			2
he said : ' have you ever fed your dog leftover food ? as if you have , you would n't be doing them ever favours whatsoever			0
' @entity10 explains : ' it 's very important that pet owners pay attention to their dog ’s health needs , particularly with regards to nutrition			1
owners may think they 're being kind giving their dog leftovers , but this could have a detrimental impact on their pet 's health if the wrong foods are given			2
clean plates all round : the taste testers loved the frittata treats : these muffins can be made so dogs can enjoy baked goods - never give them fruit or chocolate cake ' we have to give them the right food and exercise to stay healthy - it 's simple , like with us			1
' he added : ' men are the worst culprits as they feed pizza and curry to their dogs , female dog owners are more likely to give casserole left overs with bread			1
that can contain onion which is toxin to dogs			2
do some research and think carefully about what you feed them			2
' as @entity10 and @entity7 whip up the meals in the ' @entity86 ' , the vet also gives some tips on a dog 's nutritional needs with some ideas on how changing their diet could enhance other areas of their lives			1
for instance , did you know that feeding a dog ginger biscuits could prevent them being car sick ? or that giving them pineapple could stop them eating their own dog muck ? the recipes include some ingredients that many people perhaps would n't consider giving to a dog such as the celebrity favourite food , kale , and the herb rosemary			1
meal for two : you could share this sweet potato and white fish bake with your dog more please ! the dogs loved the raspberry muffins but @entity10 said kale is great for dogs because it 's high in iron and fibre while he adds ' herbs are good for us and they are good for dogs too			1
' but the pair point out in the video that there are some human foods that should never be given to dogs			2
raisins , grapes and chocolate are all toxin to them and can even be fatal			0
as a result , they point out that fruit and chocolate cake should never be given to dogs			2
but if you have a passion for baking and want to share the fruits of your labour with your pet , then @entity10 recommends raspberry muffins made using flax meal , nutritional yeast and natural yoghurt			1
other recommended treats for dogs are cheese ( in moderation ) and carrot sticks			1
feet up : the dogs were so keen to wolf down the salad they did n't give themselves time to get down from the sofa before tucking in good food for dogs : the ingredients for the tropical chicken salad , left , and raspberry muffins while the recipes might seem a little overindulgent to create for dogs , they come with a serious message about pet health			1
despite being a nation of dog lovers , many @entity167 could be sending their pets to an early grave thanks to their diet			2
processed dog foods have been found to be high in fat , sugar and salt which can cause obesity in dogs and lead to them being in general ill - health			0
new research published by @entity182 , who commissioned the @entity86 videos , reveals that one in five pet owners worry about whether they are feeding their dogs the right things			0
a third of those surveyed ( 31 per cent ) were concerned about their dog 's diet , 68 per cent of whom were worried their pets were not getting the right nutrition			1
@entity197 , head of pet insurance at @entity182 , commented : ' we receive claims for so many cases of animals suffering from toxic ingestion			0
dogs are very much an important member of the family , but foods that are a treat or even healthy to humans , can be very harmful , even lethal to our furry friends			0
working with the @entity7 and @entity211 , we hope dog owners up and down the country cook and share these delicious recipes , without it ending in a trip to the vets			0
' in the videos , @entity211 points out that the best indicator of your dog 's health is their coat - which will be shiny and glossy if they have a good diet			1
www.directline.com/pet-insurance when it 's raining cats and dogs would you like to be able to keep your pooch dry ? now you can as an umbrella for dogs has been invented			1
the product , which costs £ 14.99 from @entity236 , opens up so it faces down over the dog with an attachment to put on their collar			0
the owner then holds it over their pet using the handle			0
canine capers : border collie patch tests the dog umbrella i put it to the test for @entity252 with my border collie , @entity247			0
as he 's a breed used to being active and outdoors , he 's perhaps not the ideal candidate for the product			0
patch does n't care if he gets soaked when out for a walk , he just loves running around outside whatever the weather			0
but for selfish reasons , keeping him dry means less time spent towelling him off after a walk in the rain and avoids the house smelling of damp dog for hours			0
no chasing squirrels today : the owner has to hold the umbrella over their pet as they walk however , as you have to hold the umbrella over the dog , this is n't easy if you have one like patch who just wants to run around chasing balls and squirrels			0
not to mention how ridiculous you look in the process			0
perhaps the umbrella would suit rain and exercise adverse dogs who are happy to trot alongside their owners			0
it 's also much better suited to smaller dogs like @entity290 , pictured below , who can fit completely underneath it			1
but most will probably agree it 's barking mad			0
covered : it 's better suited to smaller dogs like @entity290			2
