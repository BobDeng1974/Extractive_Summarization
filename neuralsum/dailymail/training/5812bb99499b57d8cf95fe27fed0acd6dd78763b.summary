by @entity0 published : 05:14 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 05:15 est , 29 may 2013 fulfilling the dream of every little girl to own a pony , professional horsewoman @entity1 has generously gifted her two - year - old niece with a @entity7 pony			1
the @entity9 ’s eldest granddaughter , who is an equestrian @entity11 silver medalist from the @entity13 eventing team is clearly keen to pass on her own love of riding to little @entity15			1
the two - year - old			2
the @entity9 's great - granddaughter , is the eldest child of @entity1 ’s brother @entity15 and his wife @entity18 , and sister to one year old @entity20			1
@entity1 has given her two - year - old niece @entity15 ( right ) a @entity7 pony , perhaps hoping to pass on her own love of horses to the next generation @entity1 checked that @entity15 was enjoying herself at the @entity26 earlier this month despite her young age , @entity15 is apparently already enamored with her gift			1
according to reports in @entity31 her father @entity29 said : ‘ @entity1 was insistent on giving her a little @entity7 pony			1
‘ @entity15 loves riding him			0
so yes , it seems we ’ve passed the ' horse gene ’ on to the next generation			1
’ the @entity7 pony is a miniature breed of pony originating in the @entity7 , ranging in height from around 28 inches to 11 hands , making them perfect for small rider			0
it is not clear exactly what prompted the 32 year - old royal to make such a generous gift , but a love of riding and horses traditionally runs right through the heart of the royal family , particularly the women			2
@entity1 ’s nieces are already some of her biggest fans when it comes to her riding career			0
both girls joined their parents at the @entity26 earlier this month			0
the 31 - year old equestrian 's brother @entity15 and his wife @entity18 took both their young daughters @entity15 , two , and one - year - old @entity20 to watch their aunt compete @entity15 , two , looked particularly enamored as she watched her aunt ride , and now with her own pony she can begin to foster the ' horse gene ' herself @entity1 , who attended the @entity68 last week and cut the cake as the show celebrates its 100th birthday ( right ) is obviously very close to her niece @entity15 ( seen on her father @entity29 's shoulders , left ) the girls , who are 12th and 13th in line for the throne , played in the sunshine as they watched their aunt @entity1 , compete			1
@entity1 , who is married to @entity81 rugby player @entity80 , posted a dressage score of 44.3 penalties at the event that kept her firmly in touch with the leading group			0
however despite her success in the sport , the young royal has not been shirking her other royal duties			0
the @entity7 pony is a miniature breed of pony originating in the @entity7 , ranging in height from around 28 inches to 11 hands , making them perfect for small rider she , like other members of the royal family including @entity100 and @entity101 and the @entity9 , attended the @entity68 last week			0
though she confessed she is not a big gardener herself , she spoke of how he grandmother is an inspiration to her @entity1 says : ‘ when you 've got such inspirational ladies in your family , it 's kind of hard not to be like that			2
my grandmother 's like that , and her mother before her , and my mum			0
’ and now it looks like little @entity15 is set to follow in the ( pony ) steps of the @entity119 women .			2
