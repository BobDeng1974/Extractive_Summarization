nice work : @entity7 stands with the painting which earned her an a * in art ' i got to my as levels last year and i could n’t keep up any more - it was too painful and i had to stop			1
' medics believed that @entity7 was suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome , and she underwent surgery to fix the problem			2
but further analysis found that her discomfort was actually caused by hypermobility syndrome - a condition which loosens joints and can make gripping items impossible			1

improvisation : @entity7 taught herself to produce art with her mouth after a debilitating condition made it too painful for her to grip a brush in her hand inspired : @entity7 also tried to produce pictures by holding implements between her toes ' it was really tough at first as everything i drew came out as just ridiculous scribbles			1
' but i worked on it throughout the summer and began to build a technique of dabbing the paint onto the canvas whilst holding a brush in my mouth			0
' it was slow work but it seemed to get results			0
' when we were given our coursework title , @entity96 , i set about to really challenge myself			0
' i grabbed a huge canvas and got to work			0
it took 16 hours but i think the end result was really worth it			0
