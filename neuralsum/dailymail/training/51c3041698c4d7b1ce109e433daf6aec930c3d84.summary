@entity3 was expected to easily take @entity5 seat before comments on rape in television interview
@entity0 representative has no - *exception* rule in his *anti-abortion* stance
mr @entity3 later *backtracked* after being *widely* *criticized* , saying his comments were ' off - the - cuff ' and he had ' deep empathy ' for rape victims
*republicans* , *including* @entity18 and @entity160 , have distanced themselves from controversy calling comments ' inexcusable '
president @entity21 chimed in calling sentiment ' way out there '
some top @entity275 want him to step down , saying apology was not enough
