@entity7 ’s @entity22 page , which includes quotes from several acclaimed intellectuals including civil rights leader the rev. @entity44 , author @entity45 and industrialist @entity46 , will also be used to counter claims that he is mentally retarded			1
@entity7 , who joined @entity22 a year ago , cites some of his likes as vocabulary and writing , while his page also includes a photo of him proudly displaying a @entity26 gang tattoo on his toned bicep			2
in a procedure expected to last three weeks , the judge will examine @entity7 ’s complete educational history , as well as a formal iq score and adaptive function tests			0

convicted murderer @entity7 has posted a famous quote from famous african - american civil rights leader @entity44 on his @entity22 page @entity7 's facebook page also included quotes from industrialist @entity46 and author @entity45 the judge will also consider if a mentally handicap person would be capable of understanding the inspirational quotes posted on his page			1
in january @entity7 posted this by thoughtful remark by rev. @entity44 : ‘ true compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar			0

@entity7 is the latest of many killers to employ the low @entity108 defense , also known as the @entity110 defense			1

@entity7 was convicted in 2003 of murdering two detectives
his lawyers now want to convince a judge that he should **n't** face the death penalty because he ' was **n't** smart enough to know what he was doing '
