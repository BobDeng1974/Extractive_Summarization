@entity9 ( left with his great granddaughter ) , 73 , who died after his @entity5 account was drained of £ 50,000 by his grandson , @entity13 ( right ) , has had to fight a legal battle from ' beyond the grave ' to get it back this photograph shows mr @entity29 and his grandson , @entity13 , together in 1994 but when relatives urged the @entity5 - which has the slogan ‘ giving you extra ’ - to refund the money into mr @entity9 ’s estate due it to be withdrawn illegally , staff intially refused , saying no money was due because the account holder was now ' deceased '			1

‘ no one told him something appeared to be wrong with his account until it was too late			2
the bank should have realised something was amiss and investigated sooner			0
when i first realised how much money @entity13 had stolen i was absolutely blown away			2
‘ when i went into my local @entity5 with my dad ’s death certificate i thought everything would be okay and that the money would be put back into my dad ’s account			1
‘ but the bank told me that because my dad was n’t here to make a statement they would n’t be able to give the money back			1
it was bad enough being betrayed by a member for the family , but it seemed we were being betrayed all over again by certain people in the bank			0
i would have thought the bank would have investigated sooner			0
‘ everyone was telling me to give up			0
they all said the same : " you ca n’t beat the banks , you ca n’t beat the banks			0
" but i had promised my dad i would get the money back for him and there was no way that i was going to give up			1

‘ my dad passed away on october 15 , but i had to wait until @entity13 was jailed on the december 15 before i could do anything			2
but even then i visited the @entity52 branch countless times and they did n’t seem to be able to help me and told me they would n’t pay out as my father and died			0
‘ i could n’t believe it			0
i had done everything they had asked and now they were telling me it was n’t going to be			0
i called the bank ombudsman and they told me i had to lodge an official complaint and give @entity5 eight weeks to investigate			0
‘ for a whole week i called @entity5 and wrote complaints to them on @entity148 and @entity149			0
the money was meant to be an inheritance for the family and we wanted to make sure that it went to the right people			2

one of the last things my dad said to me was to make sure @entity13 got nothing			2
@entity13 was the apple of my dad ’s eye			2
my dad would have given him anything he wanted			0
‘ at the very end my dad was too ill to change his will and we did n’t have the money to pay for the solicitor ’s fees to get it changed , but i am now doing everything in my power to make sure that @entity13 gets nothing			1

‘ in situations such as mr @entity9 ’s , where an account holder has passed away , we are still able to investigate potentially fraudulent activity at the request of a recognised authority of the account , such as an executor			1
‘ since mr @entity9 has been able to provide the necessary documentation of his role as the executor of his father ’s estate we have been able to take the necessary steps to undertake a thorough investigation			1
