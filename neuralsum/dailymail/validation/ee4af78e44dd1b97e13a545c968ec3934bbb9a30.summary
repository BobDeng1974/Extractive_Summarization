convicted criminals could be banned from smoking in the communal areas of prisons after a landmark court ruling			1
a high court judge in @entity5 has declared that the 2006 @entity6 , which prohibits lighting up in public and in workplaces , applies to all crown premises , including prisons			2
it comes after mr justice @entity12 rejected justice secretary @entity14 's argument that the @entity15 had immunity from the @entity6			0
criminals could be banned from smoking in the communal areas of prisons following a landmark ruling at the @entity21 in @entity5 however , the judge accepted his ruling had wide - ranging implications and said it should not take effect until mr @entity14 has had a chance to appeal			1
the judge was told by @entity30 lawyers that criminalising smoking could lead to unrest in the jails of @entity34 and @entity35			1
prisoners can smoke in their cells with the door shut and outside in exercise yards , but both inmates and staff could face prosecution for lighting up in communal areas if the ruling is not overturned on appeal			1
the case was brought by @entity47 , an inmate at @entity48 in @entity49 , who says he suffers from a range of health problems made worse by second - hand smoke			1
high court judge mr @entity12 , pictured , made the ruling after rejecting the argument that crown premises had immunity from the @entity58 , which bans smoking in public places and in workplaces lawyers for @entity47 , a sex offender who has been at @entity48 since 2009 , argued both prisoners and staff were guilty of lighting - up in areas prohibited under prison rules , including on landings , in laundry rooms and in healthcare waiting rooms			1
lawyers for the justice secretary maintained the rules and regulations , especially the sanction of withdrawal of privileges , were sufficient to deal any problem			0
the @entity6 already applies to private prisons as they are not @entity15 premises			0
mr @entity12 , sitting in @entity5 , declared : ' in my judgment it is clear from the terms of the @entity86 that the intention of @entity88 was indeed that it should apply to all public places and workplaces which fell within its scope , including those for which the @entity15 is responsible			2
' but giving permission to appeal , the judge acknowledged concerns in the @entity99 over the impact of his decision on ' prisoners who feel the need to smoke and may be resistant to the criminalising of that conduct in places where in my view the @entity6 does apply			2
' @entity47 had also argued that prisoners were legally entitled to anonymous and confidential access to the @entity112 freephone smoke - free compliance line to report infringements of the rules			2
the judge said that issue should be reconsidered by the justice secretary in the light of his judgment			0
@entity47 is serving a sentence of indeterminate detention for public protection ( @entity122 ) after being convicted in 2007 of sexual assault and outraging public decency			0
his minimum term in jail expired after 203 days but he can not be released on licence until the @entity128 decides he is no longer a danger to the public			0
the case was brought to the @entity21 by @entity47 , an inmate at @entity48 in @entity49 , pictured , who says he suffers from a range of health problems made worse by second - hand smoke @entity47 's solicitor @entity135 , head of the @entity136 at @entity137 , said : ' the judgment confirms that the legal restrictions on smoking apply every bit as much in prisons as in the public places and workplaces in the wider community			1
' the judgment is important in confirming that prisoners are entitled to the same level of protection from the risks posed by second - hand smoke as everyone else			1
' however , a @entity154 spokeswoman said ; ' prison cells in @entity34 remain exempt from the smoke - free legislation that came into effect in 2007			0
' since that time we have introduced a number of measures to reduce the risk of exposure of staff and prisoners to second - hand smoke			2
we are undertaking additional measures to continue to lessen the impact of smoking in prisons			0
' this includes tightening our current smoking controls , undertaking air quality monitoring in prison accommodation , and maximising the provision of smoking cessation support to those prisoners who want to stop smoking			0

@entity21 rules smoking in communal areas of prisons should be banned
mr @entity12 says smoking ban should apply to all crown premises
comes after case was brought by @entity47 , an inmate at @entity48
he claims he suffers health problems caused by second - hand smoke
but @entity30 say criminalising smoking could lead to unrest in jails
currently prisoners can smoke in cells with doors shut or in exercise yards
