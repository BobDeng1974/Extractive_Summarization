' i could n't perform with my husband in bed properly , i could n't speak to him about it			2
i was very withdrawn with my husband and the thought of oral sex terrified me and still does			2
' i think i had gone to talk to the doctor about my childhood			2
i ca n't remember why and he suggested counselling , private counselling on a monday at 6pm in the surgery			2
@entity0 pictured outside the @entity28 hearing in @entity29 where he was accused of having a string of sexual encounters at his surgery			1
the woman on the right is unknown ' we spoke about my childhood , the effect it was having on my marriage and the effect it was having with my husband in our love life			2
' i felt it was n't right because i just did n't feel comfortable even with my husband			0
at the start it was all about my self - esteem and how to build it up			0
he told me i was a pretty looking girl and that i had nothing to worry about that he had been a psychiatrist and to put my trust in him			0
' she said she ' fully ' put her trust in dr @entity0 and recalled how she told him everything adding : ' from my childhood , what i was made to do , what i could n't do in bedroom with my husband and my relationship with my children			1
' he told me i should walk about the house naked with my children present , that i should have a bath with my boys , that there was nothing to be ashamed of and to show him how to clean himself because i could n't touch my son			0
' it did n't feel right to me after what i 'd been through to touch my son			0
' by @entity111 2003 the patient said she considered the doctor a friend and even bought him a @entity111 present , she said : ' i called him a friend			2
' ' i always thought it was to help me but i was n't , it was always about his own needs and what he wanted			0
' she said the sessions did begin to change when the doctor examined her back and found she had a curvature of the spine			0
he commented on the unusual shape of her tail bone and asked if he could take a photo for medical reasons and the patient agreed			2
she said he had also examined her internally because of the pain in her stomach , which occurred after sexual intercourse with her husband			1
@entity31 said her home life began to suffer			0
she explained : ' because i do n't think my husband understood why i was getting counselled , so it caused arguments in the house why i was getting counselled			0
' ' later if i brought my childhood up with dr @entity0 he would change the subject he would talk about myself and my sex life with my husband and what i was like with my children and suggested things i should do to try and help myself orgasm			1
' ' he said he needed to work on things that i was afraid of most and told me to trust him and that he was in charge , he knew what he was doing and just to trust him , he would n't do anything to hurt me and he would n't let anything go too far and i believed him			0
' on occasions the @entity156 was said to have asked the woman to give him oral sex after she claimed it was ' her worst fear '			1
when asked about the point of doing this the patient replied : ' that it would save my marriage and it would make me a bit more confident and i would get over my fear			2
' ' he asked me to bend over the table and he would show me way of having sexual intercourse that would n’t hurt			1
' ' i always thought it was to help me but i was n't , it was always about his own needs and what he wanted			0
he said i dressed well and that i had a lovely figure for a girl my age and that i should n't be ashamed of my figure or my body			0
' counsel to the @entity28 @entity184 said it may seem surprising the patient did not realise sooner what was happening but he said given her past and vulnerability she was unaware			0
he said the events had caused her great emotional and psychological distress and said she went on to self - harm and her marriage failed			0
he told the hearing : ' @entity31 no longer wanted to talk about the sexual abuse she suffered at her father 's hands but the doctor encouraged her to talk about it and that it would allow her to be more sexually open			1
' the panel may think it does have the elements of grooming rather than an impulsive act and this is in the context of a vulnerable patient			0
' the doctor we say was taking advantage and in the end the therapy was to perform sexual acts with the doctor that @entity31 feared within the context of her marriage			2
' he said she was in total control and that would free @entity31 to try these acts out with her husband			0
' ' towards the very end the doctor forced @entity31 to have sexual intercourse during a session explaining he was showing her a different position to use with her husband			1
this made @entity31 realise what was happening			0
' the hearing was told a friend of @entity31 known as @entity232 who had also suffered a sexual abuse ordeal as a child and a third woman known as @entity237 made complaints of a sexually motivated nature about dr @entity0			1
he denies misconduct and the hearing continues			0
