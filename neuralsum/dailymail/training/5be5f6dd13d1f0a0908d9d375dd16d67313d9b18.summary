the @entity0 has confirmed he will visit both @entity1 and @entity2 as part of a trip to the @entity5 later this year			1
the @entity6 had previously announced that the @entity7 would visit @entity8 to participate in a massive rally for @entity11 families in september			1
but speaking to reporters on a plane returning to @entity15 at the end of a trip to @entity18 and the @entity19 yesterday , @entity12 said he would be visiting the two cities for the first time since becoming head of the @entity23			2
here he confirmed he would be visiting @entity2 and @entity1 later this year the itinerary for the trip is yet to be finalised but it is expected that he could visit the @entity33 and address @entity34 as well as speak at the @entity35 in @entity1			1
it is also believed he could give a mass in @entity38 and visit @entity39			1
however , it has been confirmed that when in the @entity5 capital he will take part in a ceremony to cannonise @entity44 , an 18th century @entity46 @entity45 priest			1
there had been speculation that the @entity0 could have included a stop in @entity50 as part of his @entity5 visit , especially as @entity44 founded missions in the state			1
but the 79 - year - old said : ' i would like to go to @entity50 for the canonisation of @entity44 , but i think there is the problem of time			0
it requires two more days			0
' he then said that the sainthood ceremony would take place at the @entity65 instead			1
@entity44 was born on the @entity46 island of @entity67 in 1713 , went to the @entity68 in the middle of the 18th century and led one of the first @entity45 missions in @entity50			2
he arrived in @entity72 in 1769 and spent most of the rest of his life there before dying at a mission in @entity77 near @entity78 in 1784			0
meanwhile the city of @entity8 has already begun preparations for the @entity7 's visit in september , which will coincide at the end of the week long @entity83			1
there had been speculation that @entity12 was set to visit @entity50 but he told journalists on the flight that there would n't be enough time it is expected that 1.5 million people could turn out for an open air mass on the steps of the city 's main art museum and that the crowd could fill a one - and - a - half mile stretch of parkway along the @entity99			1
@entity12 also disclosed proposed trips to @entity101 , in particular the @entity102 and @entity103 , which would most likely take place at the end of 2015 to avoid the rainy seasons			2
there are also plans to visit @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 , most likely in july			0
he also confirmed he hoped to visit @entity111 , @entity110 and @entity112 in 2016 â€” and @entity113 at some point			2
the announcement of his travel plans comes after the pope addressed a record six million @entity23 in @entity28 on sunday as his @entity30 pilgrimage drew to a close			0
on the flight back to the @entity6 , he also spoke of how @entity23 ' should n't breed like rabbits ' and should instead practice ' responsible parenting '			0
while firmly upholding church teaching banning contraception , @entity12 said there are plenty of church - approved ways to regulate births			0
but he said most importantly , no outside institution should impose its views on regulating family size , blasting what he called the ' ideological colonization ' of the developing world			0
@entity12 , pictured yesterday as he departed @entity136 in @entity28 , says @entity23 do not have to breed ' like rabbits ' @entity101 bishops , in particular , have long complained about how progressive @entity140 ideas about birth control and gay rights are increasingly being imposed on the developing world by groups , institutions or individual nations , often as a condition for development aid			0
he said : ' every people deserves to conserve its identity without being ideologically colonized			0
' the @entity0 's comments , taken together with his defence of the @entity23 's ban on artificial contraception during the trip , could be a signal that a more conservative side to the pope is emerging .			2
