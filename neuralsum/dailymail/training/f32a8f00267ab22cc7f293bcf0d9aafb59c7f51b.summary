in all , lord @entity32 ’s polling suggested an average swing from @entity1 to the @entity17 of 25 per cent – a shift not seen in modern political history			1
that would mean the @entity17 snatching 35 of the 41 seats @entity1 won in 2010 , leaving them humiliated in a traditional heartland			2
it also means the @entity17 is likely to hold the balance of power in a hung @entity41			0

he said : ‘ these polls show that @entity1 is well behind and has a big gap to close			0
‘ but in the end the only people who will benefit from these polls are @entity86 and the @entity87			0
‘ it is a simple fact that the single biggest party gets to form the next government			0
‘ the more seats the @entity17 get from @entity1 , the more likely it is the @entity87 will be the biggest party and @entity86 will get into government through the back door			2
’ labour strategists are desperately hoping that talking up the prospect of another @entity87 - led government will persuade some of their former voters to come home			0
they also believe that some of the 400,000 voters who backed the @entity78 in 2010 might be prepared to vote tactically to stop the @entity17			0
however , lord @entity32 ’s polling indicated that the @entity17 ’s pitch to voters since losing last year ’s independence referendum – vote @entity17 to ensure a strong @entity7 presence at @entity11 – is resonating			2
‘ the single most popular general election outcome in these seats was a coalition involving @entity1 and the @entity17 – a result favoured by 39 per cent of voters overall , including 62 per cent of @entity17 supporters and 79 per cent of @entity1 - @entity17 switchers , ’ said lord @entity32			1
‘ huge swings to the @entity17 in national polls suggest that even some mps who must have thought they had a job for life are threatened			0
‘ if a swing to the @entity17 … were to be repeated across the board next may it would endanger 35 of @entity1 ’s 41 seats in @entity7			1
’ @entity17 general election campaign director @entity123 said : ‘ these polls include some of @entity1 ’s safest seats in the whole of the @entity127 as well as @entity7 , and they are clearly excellent for the @entity17 - but we are taking absolutely nothing for granted , and will work hard for every vote and seat in may			1
‘ these seat - by - seat polls also underline the extent to which @entity1 are paying a huge price for their toxic referendum alliance with the @entity87 - which to all intents and purposes has continued			0
‘ people can only make @entity7 ’s priorities @entity11 ’s priorities by voting @entity17 in may			2
’ some shadow ministers are understood to be pressuring @entity1 leader @entity23 to publicly rule out any post-election deal with the @entity17 , led by @entity143 , pictured the research was conducted in january among 16,000 voters in 16 @entity7 constituencies – 14 currently held by @entity1 , mostly in areas with a strong support for independence , and two held by the @entity56			1
