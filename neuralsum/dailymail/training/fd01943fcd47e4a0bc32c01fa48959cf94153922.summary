@entity0 has unveiled his 23 - man squad to bid for @entity3 glory when the @entity5 jet out to @entity6 later this summer			1
@entity0 confirmed he will be taking a side packed with young talent as @entity5 bid to end their 48 - year wait for a second world title			1
one notable absentee is @entity14 midfielder @entity13 , less than two years after he was tempted out of international retirement by the @entity5 manager			2
@entity0 also revealed @entity32 youngster @entity31 will come into the squad if @entity35 ' shoulder injury does not heal in time			1
@entity36 and @entity37 ( with 162 caps between them ) are the other most senior internationals jettisoned			1
@entity41 , who has scored 14 goals this season , gets the nod ahead of @entity45			1
former @entity46 striker @entity37 , who now plays for @entity47 , is only good enough for a place on the standby list			1
@entity13 rejected the chance to be on the standby list for @entity52 , but he has accepted the same position this time around			1
no - go : @entity13 has missed out on a chance of being in the @entity5 midfield in @entity6 @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity35 , @entity17 , @entity62 , @entity27 , @entity63 , @entity28 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity29 , @entity41 , @entity21 , @entity69 , @entity70 standby : @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity45 , stones , @entity37 , @entity13 @entity13 is joined in @entity0 's contingency planning by @entity72 , who has not made the 23 despite starting nine consecutive games under @entity0 at the start of the 2012 - 13 season			1
@entity0 has selected just four strikers for the tournament in @entity6 , which kicks off on june 12			2
@entity21 will be the leading striker , with @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity41 in support			2
@entity65 , 35 , makes the cut , but otherwise there is a youthful look about @entity5 's midfield selection			0
@entity27 , 20 , has been selected , alongside @entity87 teenager @entity86 duo @entity67 and @entity29 are in the 23 despite their recent injury concerns			1
@entity90 : @entity68 is one of several young players included in @entity5 's charge for @entity6 different ball game : @entity14 midfielder @entity72 played a round of golf after being named on @entity5 's stand - by list for the @entity3 @entity64 , who has three caps , has been rewarded for a fine year with @entity99 by being included			1
@entity66 also is favoured ahead of the likes of @entity61 and @entity101 - neither of whom made the squad or standby list			1
there were no surprises in defence			0
@entity59 , @entity60 , @entity35 and @entity62 were @entity0 's four centre - halves			1
@entity58 goes to @entity6 as first - choice left - back , with @entity17 in reserve			1
@entity111 goes to the tournament as @entity5 's only recognised right - back			0
@entity0 selected @entity57 as third goalkeeper behind @entity56 and @entity115			2
there was a place on the standby list for @entity32 teenager @entity31 , who only made his first @entity120 start in january			1
impressed : @entity64 capped off a brilliant season by being named in @entity5 's squad for @entity6 uncapped @entity87 right - back @entity73 was also on the standby list			1
those standby players will fly to @entity125 with the squad next monday for a week - long training camp			2
@entity0 admitted the decision to leave out @entity36 was ' an unbelievably hard ' call			1
' @entity36 is a player that i and the rest of my staff appreciate , ' he said			2
' he is a magnificent player and what he 's done for @entity5 is second to none			0
@entity17 has had a wonderful season			2
he has captured headlines with his form and ability			0
' one player has 107 caps and one has many caps to come			0
it was a hard job to ring @entity36 and i can only be unbelievably grateful for the gracious way he accepted the decision			0
' circumstances will prove whether the decision to take the younger player was the right one or not			0
' for @entity13 , it is a miserable end to a disastrous season at @entity151 and another unsatisfactory episode in a haphazard @entity5 career of 31 appearances in 13 years			0
it began with a debut against @entity157 in 2001 at the age of 19 and his last cap was as a starter against @entity161 in the final @entity3 qualifier in october			0
back in action : @entity29 has been named despite a lengthy spell out with injury golden chance : @entity41 caps off a fantastic season for @entity99 by beating @entity45 there has been only one taste of action in a major tournament , when @entity172 selected him against @entity173 in @entity174 2006			1
nine of his caps have been awarded by @entity0 , since he was lured out of retirement in 2012			0
like @entity36 , his experience and reliability has proved valuable to @entity5 during the campaign for @entity6			0
he played in the six of the qualifiers , but @entity0 has shown a glimpse of his ruthlessness by casting them both aside as he moves the team into the next phase			0
confusion reigned as @entity13 was left out two years ago			0
having officially retired from international football under @entity190 , @entity0 assumed that was that			0
‘ i was given to believe he did n’t want to be part of the @entity5 set - up , ’ said @entity0 , but it turned out he did want to play and had unfinished business with @entity5			2
young gun : @entity99 starlet @entity17 has been picked ahead of @entity36 after a terrific 2011 - 12 season with his club , the @entity14 midfielder came back for the friendly against @entity203 in @entity204 , amid a national debate about how to value ball possession , which followed the exit in @entity208 orchestrated by @entity210 pass - master @entity209			1
in the heat of a @entity3 , which will start for @entity5 in the jungle city of @entity213 , @entity13 might have expected this to be the perfect moment for his calming qualities , but events at @entity14 have not helped			0
nor has the development of young midfield players			0
a year ago , @entity13 started the summer friendlies in the absence of @entity63 against the @entity222 at @entity223 and @entity6 in @entity224 , and deep midfield was one of the areas where @entity0 considered his options to be thin			1
@entity29 was struggling for fitness – as he still is - and @entity27 had yet to emerge as a force at @entity120 level			2
@entity28 , too , has progressed beyond expectations in the last 12 months			0
world at his feet : @entity32 starlet @entity27 could be one of @entity5 's wild cards in @entity6 without @entity13 , however , there is no natural replacement for @entity63 as the midfield anchorman if the captain is lost to injury or suspension during the tournament			1
@entity243 is another with the required defensive instinct , able to deputise in the holding role but he has never been recalled by @entity0 since he was injured in @entity246 , in a warm - up friendly against of @entity52			2
@entity65 has played the holding role at times for @entity248 but has not made the conversion as completely as @entity63			0
the ever - versatile @entity66 and @entity35 could be adapted , but if there is a bare patch in the squad it is here			0
it appears to have been boiled down to a straight choice between @entity256 graduates @entity65 and @entity13 to supply midfield experience ; @entity13 ’s stability and ball retention versus @entity65 ’s goal knack and general good influence around the camp			0
not for the first time @entity13 is @entity5 ’s fall - guy .			2

@entity17 picked ahead of @entity36
@entity41 gets the nod ahead of @entity45
@entity0 puts faith in young players like @entity27 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity17
@entity13 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity37 , @entity31 , @entity45 and @entity71 all on stand - by list
