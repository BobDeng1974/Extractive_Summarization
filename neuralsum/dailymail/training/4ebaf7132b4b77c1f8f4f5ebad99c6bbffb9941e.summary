@entity1 housing minister @entity0 breached @entity2 rules by @entity4 last updated at 10:56 am on 20th january 2012 shamed : @entity0 breached @entity2 rules for failing to declare payments totaling almost £ 60,000 a senior @entity9 mp was forced to apologise to the @entity2 yesterday after secretly accepting almost £ 60,000 in payments from the trade union @entity10			1
a parliamentary sleaze inquiry found @entity0 , who is married to deputy labour leader @entity5 , committed a serious breach of @entity2 rules by failing to declare a financial relationship with the union – @entity9 ’s biggest donor – for more than a year			1
mr @entity0 , 63 , is @entity16 ’s shadow housing minister and served for years as @entity9 ’s treasurer , as well as holding a string of senior positions during a 32 - year career in the trade union movement			1
but mr @entity0 was let off with a slap on the wrist after a committee of mps ruled he was a ‘ new and inexperienced mp ’			1
after his election in may 2010 , mr @entity0 said he was resigning as @entity10 ’s deputy general secretary and had ‘ declined my salary in the meantime ’			1
in fact , he continued to work for the union part time , charging up to £ 200 an hour for several months			0
mr @entity0 was paid more than £ 28,000 in wages until he finally stopped working for the union in october 2010			2
the following month he was also given a £ 30,000 pay - off			0
he also had the use of a union - funded car , which he bought at a discount on leaving			0
but despite strict rules on the declaration of outside income , none of these payments was made public until october the following year			2
embarrassment : mrs @entity5 , @entity9 's deputy leader , will have caused party leader @entity16 , right , unnecessary distress mr @entity0 also breached rules by failing to mention his relationship with @entity10 in two commons debates in which the union had an interest			1
the @entity51 said yesterday it would accept mr @entity0 ’s written apology but suggested it would have demanded a tougher penalty had he not been ‘ a new and inexperienced mp at the time ’			2
the ruling raised eyebrows yesterday at @entity57 , where mr @entity0 is widely viewed as a seasoned operator			2
he told a sleaze inquiry into the affair that he had genuinely intended not to accept any more payments from @entity10 after being elected – and even went so far as to send back a salary cheque			0
but he said the union had then asked him to carry out some work on a sensitive ‘ internal matter ’			0
he claimed he never got round to registering the payments because he was ‘ extremely busy ’			0
but he admitted he had ‘ no explanation ’ for why he had failed to check his entry in the register of mps ’ interests for almost a year			0
yesterday mr @entity0 made a brief apology in the @entity2			1
he said the failure to register the payments had been ‘ unintentional ’			0
he added : ‘ notwithstanding that the commissioner and the committee noted that the breaches were unintentional , i want to apologise unreservedly to the @entity77 and i will in future fully abide by the rules of the @entity77			0
’ @entity81 mp @entity80 , who complained to the parliamentary commissioner for standards about mr @entity0 ’s failure to register union payments , said : ‘ it is right that @entity0 ’s serious misconduct has been investigated and condemned			2
‘ @entity16 can talk all he likes about taking on the unions , but unless he publicly reprimands his shadow minister ’s misconduct , people will see him for what he is – weak and in the pockets of his union paymasters			1
