a revolutionary new haircare system has been developed which promises to give you thicker , fuller , and longer hair in just three months			1
the @entity4 range , which was developed by dr @entity5 with the help of celebrity stylist @entity7 , uses stem cells from rare plant extracts - much like many face creams - to boost and build the hair			1
according to dr @entity5 , the product promises not only to given denser and thicker hair but it also helps to prevent hair loss , protects your hair from everyday wear and tear and promotes growth from the root			1
' according to dr @entity5 , at any given time the hair on most people 's heads will be going through two different phases			1
most of the time the majority of the hair - 85 percent - will be in the anagen or ' growth phase '			1
meanwhile the other 15 percent of hair will be in the telogen or ' hair loss ' phase			1
this means it is growing and shedding simultaneously			0
dr @entity5 said their product enhances the ' growth phase ' and reduces the ' hairloss phase '			2
he said : ' the @entity4 regime leads to reactivation of hair growth by reducing the amount of hair in the telogen phase and stimulating anagen hair in the growth phase			1
' as the product helps to increase the number of hair in the anagen phase , the hair gets denser and fuller			2
research : the @entity4 range underwent clinical trails which showed how the products helped to boost hair growth the results : after using an @entity4 gel the panelists saw a marked improvement in their hair man behind the products : dr @entity5 is the head of research and development for @entity4 ' as the hairs in the anagen phase are being supported , hair becomes more vital and healthy which in turn helps to encourage hair growth by 80 per cent compared to normal levels			1
' and the results do seem to be pretty impressive			0
of a select panel who tested the product , which is currently available exclusively at @entity90 , 95 per cent found the look of their hair improved and they had less hair loss			1
harnessing stem cells from plants has been used to create creams and lotions for the body and face for sometime so using it in hair products is a natural progression			1
dr @entity5 explains why the stem cells they use are so beneficial : ' @entity4 is based on @entity106 ; a plant material known to have a high level of phytonutrients			1
the pea is a vegetable with pod fruits			0
each pod contains several peas which are rich in proteins , starch and fibres that protect the plant from disease , dangerous pathogens and @entity122 pollutants			0
' these health promoting phytonutrients are also known to exert beneficial effects on human hair by inducing dermal papilla cells [ at the root of your head ] to initiate the growth of new hair			1
' the salon science team recommend that you use the three @entity4 products together , firstly washing with the shampoo , conditioning and then using the @entity139 treatment which specifically targets hair loss			1
their wider range of products includes volume building shampoos and mousses and a @entity147 grape range with helps to repair and protect damaged hair			1
