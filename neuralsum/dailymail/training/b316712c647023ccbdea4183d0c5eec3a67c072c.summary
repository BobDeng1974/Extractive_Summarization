by @entity1 reporter a @entity3 designer has created a contraption which she says can detect cancer using trained bees			0
the bees are placed in a glass chamber which the patient exhales from			1
if the bees fly into a secondary chamber , then that means the bees have detected the disease , according to @entity12			1
a @entity3 designer has developed a device for detecting cancer using trained bees miss @entity12 , who presented her @entity17 's project at @entity18 , in @entity19 last month , said : ' trained bees only rush into the smaller chamber if they detect the odour on the patient 's breath that they have been trained to target			1
' the bees can be trained within 10 minutes			2
' scientists have discovered that honey bees have an excellent sense of smell which is better than a sniffer dog			0
bees can be trained to detect bombs and one company called @entity33 is training ' sniffer bees ' to work in counter-terrorist operations			0
if the bees fly into the secondary chamber , the designer says that means they have detected cancer a bee is trained by exposing it to certain odours before feeding them a solution of water and sugar			1
the bees then remember the smell for the rest of their lives if they are always rewarded with sugar			0
the glass object has a big chamber and a small chamber where the bees go if they detect the disease			2
research carried out by scientists has suggested that bees can accurately diagnose diseases such as tuberculosis , lung and skin cancer as well as diabetes .			0
