by @entity0 last updated at 1:30 pm on 19th july 2011 a battle of the banking giants has begun after @entity3 introduced a record 24 months of interest - free credit for balance transfers			1
the move by the @entity8 's biggest credit card provider comes in response to a 20 - month interest - free card launched by @entity11			1
the deals could offer a lifeline to thousands of @entity8 who are being saddled with punishing interest bills due to large credit card debts			2
balance transfer war : @entity3 has launched its platinum card with a two - year 0 per cent transfer period however , there are questions over how many customers will be accepted by the credit card providers			1
and critics have argued that the lengthy interest - free deals could encourage the reckless ' spend now , pay later ' attitude that leads shoppers into debt in the first place			1
the new @entity31 carries a fee of 2.8 per cent of the sum being moved on to the card , but offers £ 20 cashback for customers who transfer a balance of more than £ 3,000 directly through the @entity3 website			2
@entity38 , of personal finance website @entity39 , said : ' at 0 per cent for 24 months , the new deal from @entity3 is the longest balance transfer deal ever offered on the market			1
' in the last year , the number of longer term balance transfer deals has soared as competition has returned to the credit card market			2
' @entity48 and @entity49 already offer 0 per cent for 19 months			0
miss @entity38 pointed out that while there is no interest on the balance transfers , any new purchases made with these cards will attract interest at an average rate of 18.7 per cent			1
@entity57 , credit card spokesman at @entity59 , said : ' over the last week , we have seen the credit card wars really hotting up with @entity11 introducing a 20 - month balance transfer deal			2
temptation : critics have argued lengthy interest - free deals could encourage the reckless ' spend now , pay later ' attitude that leads shoppers into debt in the first place			1
( posed by models ) ' however , @entity3 has responded immediately with a deal that blows all others out of the water , a staggering two - year interest - free on balance transfers - a @entity8 first			1
' it is difficult to see how this deal can be bettered			0
@entity3 's latest 24 - month product charges a competitive 2.8 per cent balance transfer fee			1
' this means a consumer making just the minimum payments on a @entity8 average card balance of £ 2,221 could save up to £ 597 over the lifetime of the promotional deal , even once the balance transfer deal has been factored in			0
' this is a fantastic deal for consumers looking to consolidate existing credit card debt , but anyone going down this road needs to remember to avoid making purchases on the card or they risk losing their promotional zero per cent rate and could end up getting stung with hefty interest payments			0
' to avoid this , customers should set up a direct debit to pay off at least the minimum amount each month			0
' @entity102 , personal finance expert at @entity103 , said the competition among card companies would benefit consumers who are trying to clear their debts			0
however , he warned : ' the devil lies in the detail			0
having a market leading product is only great for customers if they can get it			0
' @entity3 's previous 20 - month balance transfer proposition proved hard to get for customers without a squeaky clean credit rating			2
' having now stretched the balance transfer period to a staggering two years , it remains to be seen just how many of those who apply for the card will actually be accepted			0
' this begs the question whether the new card is just for show or whether consumers will really get to benefit			0
