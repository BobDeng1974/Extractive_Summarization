mr @entity1 , 45 , who will be interviewed by local @entity2 if shortlisted , was unaware of the row when he applied last thursday			1
yesterday he claimed chairman @entity23 ’s views were out of step with locals who are ‘ liberal and progressive ’			2
but mr @entity23 , whose treasurer also resigned over the issue , accused the prime minister of having ‘ utterly lost touch ’ with grassroots supporters , and said ‘ virtually everyone ’ he had spoken to disagreed with the plans			1
he feared a decision to allow gay weddings - with an exemption for the @entity58 and other religions - would stop the party winning the seat , currently held by @entity40 farming minister @entity40 , and said many local members had expressed an intention not to renew their memberships this month			1

joining the @entity67 ’s youth wing as teenager , his life story is a rags to riches tale , spending years in the care system and leaving school with one @entity98 , he made millions in his early 20s by setting up the first insurance firm tailored to gay clients			2
‘ when it came up i saw myself as a natural for it ’ , he said			0
‘ it ’s a liberal held seat and all the @entity106 candidates they have had in the past have failed in some respect to appeal to these more progressive and liberal thinking voters			2
‘ a candidate with more inclusive values would be a bonus in the constituency			0
i think i could do a good job there for that exact reason			0
’ mr @entity1 said he could bring life experience to the role and that he was ‘ jaded ’ with career politicians			2

he said : ‘ i ’ve always wanted to be an mp , but not for the sake of being an mp			0
having grown up in the care system , learned from my successes and failures in business and done charity work i genuinely , genuinely think i ’ve got something to give back ’ while he disagreed with critics of gay marriage , he said he would ‘ agree to disagree ’ with voters on the issue and conceded many of his friends agreed with mr @entity23			1

’ the @entity151 seat is held by mr @entity40 with a majority of 1,819			0
mr @entity23 said : ‘ when you have a majority of 20,000 the local party can go hang , but this is a marginal seat and @entity21 has to win it if he wants to form a government and that means a lot of work by local activists before election day			1
‘ you need old ladies stuffing envelopes , people canvassing , and all those things are about keeping your membership as high as possible			0
in the shires the majority of people are against it and it ’s a matter of astonishment to me that something making people leave the party is even being considered			0
it has been pushed over everyone ’s heads , and there is a form of self - censorship at the top of the party about it			0
