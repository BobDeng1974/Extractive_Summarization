a motorist who stopped his car after witnessing the accident ran over and wrapped the baby in his t - shirt			1
he then performed cpr for three minutes before the baby began to cry			1
miss @entity6 said : ' it is a miracle that she is alive			1
for all intents and purposes she was dead for seven minutes , four in the car , then three at the roadside			0
' it was like an out - of - body experience , like i was watching a soap or something			0
she had blue lips and blue fingertips			1
i really did n't think she was going to wake up			0
lucky to be alive : the wreckage of @entity6 's car shows just how lucky she was to have survived a crash into a ditch the remains of @entity6 's car which overturned in a ditch			1
her four - month old daughter @entity7 was trapped underwater for four minutes			1
' that poor man was shaking and crying as he tried to resuscitate her			0
he kept going until she started to make a noise			0
he kept on going until she was fully screaming			0
' i ca n't thank him enough - i owe my little girls ' life to him			0
' ' the doctors do n't really know how she managed to survive , let alone escape without any brain damage			0
' ' maybe it 's because she is a bit of a chubbier baby , but it is still a total mystery			2

she said : ' we got called to a report of a car upside down and that police were on route			0
" paramedics were also advised that the car had gone into a dyke and the baby was n't breathing			1
' when we arrived @entity114 had already been commenced by a bystander			2
' a leading paediatrician from the @entity117 has said it is possible that @entity7 survived because her metabolism was slowed by the cold water			2
dr @entity121 , a @entity122 from @entity123 , said : ' if a young child is submerged in cold water then a number of reflexes come into play which result in a slowing down of the child 's metabolism thus reducing the need for oxygen			2
' in addition , during drowning the muscles around the throat may act to prevent the inhalation of water into the lungs			0
' together these reflexes make resuscitation more likely to be successful by limiting damage to vital organs including the brain			0
' with effective resuscitation there is a possibility that an infant submerged in cold water could survive and not suffer significant brain damage			0
