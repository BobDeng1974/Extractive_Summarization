sometimes , as anyone who has ever come into contact with @entity3 's manager @entity2 will tell you , sorry seems to be the hardest word			1
sadly @entity7 's former chairman @entity6 was not here to witness @entity2 's public apology for digging out the referee on tv over his failure to award @entity3 a second - half penalty			1
it probably helped that they scored anyway after @entity17 's shot had been charged down and @entity18 twisted inside the area to score their second			1
the nation should be grateful for small mercies , though			0

booked : @entity70 , @entity79 manager : @entity89 5.5 attendance : 41,010 * ratings by @entity92 at @entity47 @entity2 did not say sorry to those he insulted after claiming that a campaign was being waged against @entity3 when they slipped up at @entity95 and were beaten 5 - 3 at @entity96 , but we can not expect every thing			1
' we had a big penalty in our favour and i was speaking with the referee and i want to apologise for my earlier comments to tv because what he did was great refereeing			0
' he was saw that it was a penalty , he was going to give a penalty , but he saw the ball was going to @entity18 and he waited a couple of seconds			2
' he told me that if @entity18 did not control the ball or if the ball goes over the bar or the ball was lost then he would have given a penalty			2
so it was good refereeing			0
' i was complaining but it was good refereeing by @entity119			0
' thankfully @entity18 scored because the fall - out from yet another perceived injustice would have been too much for even the most one - eyed @entity3 fan to stomach after the past few days			1
something has rattled @entity2 's cage of late , but the twinkle in his eye has returned after @entity3 finally broke down @entity129 's team			1
he made eight changes to the side beaten at @entity132 , giving captain @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity64 and the rest of the gang the day off after their chasing in north @entity139			0
even then it took a double substitution at half time , replacing the woeful @entity59 and the ineffective @entity60 , with the energy of @entity17 and @entity26 to make the difference			1
' sometimes we do n't have good performances and i needed some guarantees of winning , ' added @entity2			1
' to have @entity26 and @entity17 was important to us			1
' it certainly was because @entity2 is becoming increasingly irritable in the dug out			2
for varying reasons @entity18 , @entity60 and even @entity3 doctor @entity151 got it in the neck during a frustrating first half			1
@entity7 goalkeeper @entity155 pulls off an acrobatic save during the opening period at @entity47 @entity3 striker @entity18 ( right ) challenges @entity7 's @entity158 ( centre ) for the ball on sunday afternoon @entity7 striker @entity82 ( left ) gets back to make a sliding tackle on @entity3 's @entity27 midfielder @entity32 everytime @entity3 ventured forward there was traffic , with five yellow shirts racing across @entity7 ’s defence and four more buzzing around in midfield			1
eventually , the lights turned green			0
@entity26 scored the opener in the 58th minute , curling the ball beyond @entity69 from the edge of the area			1
it was a quality strike			0
@entity3 turned the screw , adding to their lead through @entity18 and adding a third in the 72nd minute when @entity48 ’s deft header beat @entity69 ’s outstretched fingertips			1
this was rough on @entity7			2
@entity129 had a gameplan to suffocate @entity3 ’s forward - thinking players and to hope his isolated forward @entity82 could do something special in attack			2
he had a couple of first half chances , both easily taken by @entity55 , and faded after the break when @entity3 stepped up the pace			2
‘ our plan was to stay in shape and make some counter-attacks , ’ admitted @entity129			0
‘ if we scored it could have changed everything			0
‘ if @entity82 had scored it could have changed something , but it is a good experience			0
we suffered without the ball			0

‘ the @entity44 is over for us and now we must go back to our real life in the next training session			0
’ soon enough the reality will hit home for @entity3 as they prepare to play six fixtures - a two - legged @entity217 semi-final with @entity219 , the @entity44 fourth round and three @entity222 games - in the space of 22 days			2
‘ we do n’t want to throw away any competition and sometimes we have to make some changes , ’ added @entity2			1
‘ to win the game i wanted to make some changes to the system and the dynamic			0
i want to win the game - i do n’t need to be angry			0
’ as ever with @entity3 ’s manager , it ’s always hard to talk these things over			0
