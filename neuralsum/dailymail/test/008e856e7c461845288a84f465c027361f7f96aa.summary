over the past couple of weeks it has n't just been @entity4 's departure from one direction that has been making the headlines , it 's been his personal life too			1
for @entity4 's relationship with @entity10 singer @entity9 as come under scrutiny as the 22 - year - old was once again accused of cheating on his fiance			1
at the weekend @entity16 model @entity14 claimed that she had slept with @entity4 while he was holidaying in @entity17 recently			2
it is not the first time either , so maybe she will walk away			0
' and @entity14 is right , this is n't the first time @entity4 has been accused of cheating			1
in fact , the pair 's union could be compared to that of @entity38 and @entity39			1
the similarities are certainly there			0
like @entity38 and @entity39 both @entity4 and @entity9 , 21 , have enjoyed a huge amount of fame			1
and like @entity38 and @entity39 their romance has been dogged with cheating allegations , almost from the start			1
@entity38 and @entity39 were happily married until she discovered that he had cheated on her on several occasions the @entity50 alumni twosome first got together in august 2011 but by august 2012 it was being reported that @entity4 had been filmed through the keyhole of a hotel room with another woman			1
then in february 2013 the couple were hit by a kiss and tell when @entity58 waitress @entity57 told @entity27 newspaper than she had bedded the then 20 - year - old			0
@entity57 - who took photos of @entity4 while he was asleep - said at the time : ' he 's an absolute s * * t. how dare he - not only to me but to @entity9 ? ' she also added : ' i definitely do n't think it 's the first time he 's done this			1
i feel sorry for @entity9 - she does n't know this is going on			2
it 's wrong and it has to stop			0
' then at the beginning of march @entity4 was pictured with his arm around a girl named @entity76 in @entity17 , a second shot showed the pair holding hands			0
@entity4 has been accused of cheating on four occasions , the first was by @entity57 ( left ) , the most recent was @entity16 model @entity14 when @entity57 claimed she had bedded @entity4 she claimed took these photographs of him apparently sleeping in her bed after this picture of @entity4 with @entity76 was released he tweeted saying that he loved @entity9 this photograph enraged one direction fans as it appears that @entity4 is holding @entity76 's hand in the picture that was , in fact , the only time that @entity4 , who left @entity92 last week after five years in the band , has made any comment on the stories of his betrayal			1
he took to @entity97 to say : ' i 'm 22 years old ... i love a girl named @entity9			2
and there 's a lot of jealous f * * * in this world i 'm sorry for what it looks like x ' but just a week or so later @entity14 's claims came out			0
she alleged that @entity4 had asked her to share a shower with him before taking her to the bedroom of the apartment where he was staying			0
for @entity38 , who is now re-married , the cheating rumours eventually became too much and she ended her marriage to @entity39 in 2010			1
at the time the footballer had been accused of cheating her two years			2
the first was hairdresser @entity115 who claimed to have slept with him			0
by february 2010 , just a month before @entity38 announced their split , four more women had come forward to say the same			1
@entity4 and @entity9 got engaged in 2013 but he has since been accused of cheating on her on several occasions @entity121 says that @entity4 's level of fame will be difficult for someone so young but @entity9 , who accepted @entity4 's marriage proposal in august 2013 , is currently sticking by her man - who has yet to comment on the latest allegations			1
she and @entity4 were pictured boarding a private jet earlier this week and are thought to be on a ' make or break ' holiday			0
for the most part though , despite the on - going accusations of infidelity , @entity4 has remained relatively high in public favour - unlike @entity39			1
we spoke to relationship expert @entity121 who told us that this could be because he is younger			0
she said : ' i think at this point the public are more lenient on him because he is a young guy in a boy band rather than a footballer , who are known for excessive behaviour and thinking the rules do n't apply to them			0
' but the main difference between his behaviour and that of @entity39 is that he 's young			2
' his fame might seem appealing but the reality of coping with that much money and fame at such a young age is going to have consequences			0
' of course , he 's going to make some mistakes along the way			0
i believe him when he says he 's stressed			0
will @entity9 and @entity4 's relationship ended up like @entity38 and @entity39 's ? @entity121 continued : ' @entity39 is older and , as an adult , should have the maturity to go beyond instant gratification to be able to think through the consequences			1
' the other difference of course is that @entity39 was married to @entity38 while @entity4 is dating			1
there 's a different level of commitment there			0
' but , even having said all that , i would join others in cautioning @entity9 about trusting him again			0
' the evidence appears clear that some type of infidelity is happening on a regular basis and by taking him back after each incident , @entity9 is effectively saying it 's ok to cheat			2
' @entity175 has contacted @entity4 's representative for comment .			2
