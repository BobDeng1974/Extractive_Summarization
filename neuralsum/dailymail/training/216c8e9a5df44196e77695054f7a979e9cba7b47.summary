by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 07:47 est , 11 october 2013 oil paintings of women who once featured in an advertising campaign for chocolate brand @entity4 were hung on @entity8 's @entity7 factory walls for decades			1
now the company , which was taken over by @entity10 in 1988 , wants to solve the mystery of who the women were before it 's too late			2
the brand has launched a nationwide search to find the models who posed for the paintings in the @entity20			0
post war campaign : the adverts using regular women as models aimed to show that chocolate was for everyone and not a luxury item @entity28 , archive curator at @entity10 explained : ' we are very interested in finding out who the women are in the pictures to put names to faces that have had a large presence in the company over the years			1
' the paintings are part of the history of our company and because we do n't know who they are , we only know half the story			0
for all : the oil paintings were reproduced in adverts in newspapers and magazines telling people aero milk chocolate is ' different ' ' we do n't know anything about these woman who became the @entity51 , and we would like to track them down			1
they will all be in their 80s now so this could be the last chance			0
' @entity4 first went on sale in 1935 but ceased production during @entity58 when the nation faced food shortages and rationing			1
when the makers relaunched @entity4 in 1951 , chocolate was still considered an expensive item			1
they needed an advertising campaign to show the public that the bubbly treat was available to anyone			1
artists were commissioned to create expensive oil paintings of regular women with the slogan ' different ... for her , @entity4 - the milk chocolate that 's different ! ' who 's the girl ? the models will now be in their eighties but little is known about them mr @entity28 said the adverts were innovative at the time as they were presented in a ' completely different style to what the country was used to '			1
the models are thought to be family and friends of the artists but there is limited information about them			0
he added : ' during the war everything was very stylised and cartoon like but for some reason they decided to make these adverts in a completely different way			0
' using oil paintings was unusual because they would have been expensive to reproduce , it would be the equivalent of having a poster made in gold leaf today			1
mystery : the women are thought to be friends and relatives of the commissioned artists ' they were almost hitting back after the rationing throughout the war by using such an extravagant campaign			2
' @entity8 commissioned famous artists at the time to paint the portraits who used normal women as their models , they could have been relatives or friends			2
' we are hoping if we find the women in the poster campaign we can work out what the thought process was behind it			0
' do you know who they are ? the brand is keen to find out as the paintings have been part of its @entity7 factory for decades the original oil paintings were hung in a corridor leading to the cake department of the original @entity8 's factory in @entity7			1
when the company moved its production lines in 200,6 some of the oil paintings were removed and taken to auction			2
others have become lost over time and , of the original 40 , only 20 remain today			0
now the company wants to track down the models in the paintings to help with missing details about the advertisements			0
the paintings will go on display for the first time outside of the factory in an exhibition by the @entity150 in @entity7			0
anyone who has information about the @entity4 girls should contact archivists on 01904 321166 .			0
