the relation told the @entity38 : ' we are all confused about what has happened			0
@entity41 was a genuinely lovely , clean - cut , mild - mannered family man			2
' he added : ' he was shot so calmly and so quickly , it smacks horribly of a professional hit , but we ca n't fathom why			1
he is n't the type to cave in to blackmail and it just does n't compute			0
' details of the killing , which took place in the @entity54 capital at about 10pm on october 14 , were until now shrouded in secrecy because police imposed a news blackout			1
the theory he was the victim of a professional hit , possibly by @entity62 gunmen , is being examined because @entity31 have refused to release details about his work in ' intermediate technologies '			1
police have not ruled out a robbery that went wrong and that mr @entity7 died trying to protect his wife from a violent mugging			1

’ detectives believe mr @entity7 was killed by a ' nervous criminal ' who experienced a ' violent rage ' before firing four bullets in quick succession			1
a senior investigator said : ' a nervous criminal is likely to have got into a violent rage as the couple effectively fought back , ' quoting expert police profilers			1
' four bullets entered the victim 's body in quick succession			1
the victim 's wife was also beaten severely round the face - also suggesting sudden and severe anger			1
' the profilers have spent almost two weeks studying the circumstances of the murder			0
a witness who saw mrs @entity116 after the attack said : ‘ she was clearly shocked			0
she said the men were demanding money and the car			2
’ however , the ferocity of the attack and the fact that mr @entity7 received a ‘ coup de grace ’ shot to the upper body as he was bleeding on the floor have prompted detectives to consider other options			1
the family home of @entity22 , who witnesses claim was slain when he walked out of a restaurant gunned down : @entity22 , in the blue coat , was a @entity2 @entity31 chief who was shot dead after he left the @entity136 restaurant in @entity9 on october 14			1
he is pictured with the successful @entity31 sailing team following a race last year there were claims on @entity54 websites that he had been killed by eco-terrorists angered by @entity31 's involvement in @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146			1

she was shouting , “ help , help ! ”			0
the witness initially thought the couple had been victims of a hit - and - run because he spotted a white van speeding away from them			2
he added : ‘ i tried to revive the man twice , but then he stopped breathing			0
i resuscitated him and he came to			0
then he became unconscious again and at that moment the ambulance arrived			0
as the paramedics cut open the man ’s clothing i saw he had a bullet in his chest and a bullet in his shoulder			0
there was also blood on his head			0

@entity54 police denied they had put a media blackout on the crime because it had been reported in three local @entity278 language newspapers in the days afterwards			1
