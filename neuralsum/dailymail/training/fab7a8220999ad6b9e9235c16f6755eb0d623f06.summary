many people are aware of the health implications of being severely overweight or obese , but scientists at the @entity15 in the @entity16 wanted to see the impact of small weight gain of five to 11 pounds			1
lead author dr @entity19 , said : ' to our knowledge , for the first time , we showed that the blood pressure increase was specifically related to increases in abdominal visceral fat , which is the fat inside the abdomen			1
' our research suggests that healthy people who are more likely to gain weight in the stomach area are also more likely to have their blood pressure increased			2
' at the beginning of the eight - week study , a 24 - hour monitor tested the blood pressure of 16 normal weight people			2
researchers fed them an extra 400 to 1,200 calories each day with their choice of an ice cream shake , chocolate bar or energy drink to increase their weight by about five per cent			0
afterwards , their blood pressure was taken for another 24 - hour period			2
their results were compared to 10 normal weight , healthy people who maintained the same weight over the eight weeks			0
the researchers found those who gained weight had a systolic blood pressure ( top number ) increase from an average 114 mm hg to an average 118 mm hg			1
those who gained more weight inside their abdomen had a greater blood pressure increase			2
however , a five to 11 pound weight gain did not affect cholesterol , insulin or blood sugar levels			1
the study was conducted in healthy people aged 18 to 48			0
dr @entity19 said further studies will need to be conducted to see if the results are similar in different age groups , those with a family history of high blood pressure and other groups			0
' the public awareness of the adverse health effects of obesity is increasing ; however , it seems most people are not aware of the risks of a few extra pounds , ' added dr @entity19			0
