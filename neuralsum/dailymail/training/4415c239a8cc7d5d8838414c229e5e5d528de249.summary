by @entity0 scientists have been able to develop potential treatment for nerve and brain disorders such as motor neurone disease and @entity6 's with the help of a molecule normally found in @entity9			1
researchers have been growing working spinal cord cells on a ‘ carpet ’ made from the same silicone polymer molecule which gives the popular children ’s toy its unusual properties			1
the @entity18 team found that motor nerves grew faster and more often on an ultra-soft material made from silicone polymer molecule polydimethylsiloxane , than it did on a normal rigid surface			1
silly success : @entity18 scientists have been able to grow working spinal cord cells on ' carpet ' made from silicone polymer molecule polydimethylsiloxane - also used in @entity9 the neurones also showed electrical activity comparable with that of motor nerves in the body			1
the study is the first to show that physical , as well as chemical , signals directly affect the development of human embryonic stem cells			2
@entity9 , created by accident during @entity40 research into potential rubber substitutes , bounces but also flows like a liquid and breaks when hit sharply			1
@entity44 ( @entity44 ) is mainly responsible for the odd properties that have made @entity9 a hit with children around the world			1
the new research involved coaxing embryonic stem cells to grow and develop on a soft ‘ carpet ’ made from @entity44 threads			1
important work : the ' silly putty carpet ' could be used to develop potential treatment for nerve and brain disorders such as motor neurone disease and @entity6 's ( stock image ) after 23 days , colonies of spinal cord motor neurones appeared that were four times purer and 10 times larger than those grown on traditional plates			1
lead scientist dr @entity70 , from the @entity68 in @entity69 , said : ‘ this is extremely exciting			0
to realise promising clinical applications of human embryonic stem cells , we need a better culture system that can reliably produce more target cells that function well			2
@entity9 was one of the most popular toy of the 20th century , a result of an ' accident ' during the @entity40			2
it was invented by engineer @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79 in 1943 as he was attempting to create a synthetic rubber			0
the result was not able to replace rubber - but its unusual qualities , the ability to flow like a liquid , bounce like a ball , or break given a sharp blow , made it a popular toy			0
by 1987 , two million @entity9 eggs were sold every year			2
the mass is composed of 65 per cent dimethyl siloxane ( hydroxy - terminated polymers with boric acid ) , 17 per cent silica ( crystalline quartz ) , nine per cent @entity92 ( castor oil derivative ) , four per cent polydimethylsiloxane , one per cent decamethyl cyclopentasiloxane , one per cent glycerine , and one per cent titanium dioxide			0
‘ our approach is a big step in that direction , by using synthetic micro-engineered surfaces to control mechanical environmental signals			0
’ the researchers , who describe their work in the journal @entity111 , believe the technique could lead to better ways of guiding the ‘ differentiation ’ of stem cells			0
differentiation is the process by which a ‘ blank slate ’ stem cell morphs into one of the body 's more than 200 different cell types			0
dr @entity70 specialises in amyotrophic laeral sclerosis ( @entity125 ) , also known as motor neurone disease			0
the illness , suffered by @entity129 physicist professor @entity128 , causes paralysis by destroying motor cells in the brain and spinal cord			1
the hope is that stem cell therapies might in future enable patients with motor neurone disease and other conditions affecting the brain and movement to grow new nerves			0
professor @entity143 , from the @entity68 's medical school , who is collaborating with dr @entity70 , said : ‘ for @entity125 , discoveries like this provide tools for modelling disease in the laboratory and for developing cell - replacement therapies			0
’ dr @entity70 added : ‘ our work suggests that physical signals in the cell environment are important in neural patterning , a process where nerve cells become specialised for their specific functions based on their physical location in the body			2

scientists grew working spinal cord cells on ' carpet ' made from silicone
silicone polymer molecule polydimethylsiloxane is also used in @entity9
could help develop treatment for nerve and brain disorders like @entity6 's
