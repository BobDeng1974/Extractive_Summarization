by @entity0 secrecy : @entity3 president @entity2 suggested a vote on the budget should be conducted in secret @entity7 prompted uproar last night by plotting to try to block the budget deal using a secret ballot so voters can not hold them to account			1
it emerged that they are planning to use a little - understood procedure to allow them to vote in private and defy the 27 @entity16 leaders			2
@entity2 , president of the @entity3 and former leader of its socialist group , suggested a vote on the budget should be conducted in secret to allow @entity24 to break away from prime ministers and party leaders and maximise the chances of it being rejected			1
a vote behind closed doors would also spare @entity7 ’ blushes ahead of @entity33 elections in 2014 , when voters seeing austerity imposed at home might punish their profligacy			0
if a fifth of @entity24 – 150 – declare that they want the budget vote to be a secret ballot , that is how it will be conducted under the @entity3 ’s rules			1
a senior @entity44 official described the idea as a ‘ shocking subversion of democracy ’			0
but mr @entity2 declared : ‘ as president of the @entity3			1
i can not , will not and indeed may not accept what amount to deficit budgets			0
’ he claimed cutting spending breached @entity16 treaties which state that financial means will be made available ‘ to allow the @entity55 to fulfil its legal obligations in respect of third parties ’			0
he added : ‘ more and more tasks and less and less money			0
the @entity3 will not go along with this			0
’ @entity62 , the current leader of the @entity33 socialists and democrats , said : ‘ the agreement of the @entity3 for the figures discussed is not imaginable			0
’ guarantee : the threat of a secret vote will pile pressure on @entity71 to guarantee that @entity73 meps , who belong to the group , will not attempt to block the budget their stance will pile pressure on @entity71 to guarantee that @entity24 , who belong to the group , will not attempt to block the budget			2
@entity79 , leader of the @entity80 in @entity81 , said : ‘ this is a ridiculous ruse and a disgrace to the institution president @entity2 is supposed to run			2
’ @entity85 , leader of the @entity77 , said : ‘ if meps want to reject an agreement made by their own prime ministers then they should have the courage of their convictions and not try to cower behind a procedural technicality			1
’ a budget vote is expected to take place in the @entity3 in march .			1

@entity2 , president of the @entity3 , suggested private vote
it would allow meps to rebel against prime ministers and party leaders
if a fifth of meps declare that they want budget vote to be a secret ballot this is how it will be conducted
