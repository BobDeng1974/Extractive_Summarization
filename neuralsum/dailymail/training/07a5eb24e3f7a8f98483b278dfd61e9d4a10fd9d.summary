by @entity0 a @entity2 man who saved hundreds of @entity4 children from the holocaust is to be given the highest honour of the @entity7			1
sir @entity8 , who celebrated his 105th birthday last week , organised the transport of 669 children – mostly @entity4 – from @entity13 - occupied @entity12			1
independently of @entity15 , which did not include the children of @entity12 , he ensured that over the course of nine months before the @entity18 broke out in september 1939 they made their way to @entity2			1
sir @entity8 , organised the transport of 669 children - mostly @entity4 - from @entity13 - occupied @entity12 , at the @entity21 in @entity22 highest honour : sir @entity8 with one of the children he rescued the ceremony held at the @entity27 for sir @entity8 sir @entity8 enjoyed his birthday party with a smile on his face and showed no signs of fatigue despite the never ending attention of almost one hundred well - wishers most of the children 's families ended up being sent to @entity13 concentration and death camps and were murdered during the @entity5			1
the decision to grant sir @entity42 was announced by the @entity7 ambassador , @entity43 , at an event in @entity22 to mark his birthday			1
it also follows the launch of a biography written by his daughter , @entity49			2
in a letter to the former stockbroker , the @entity7 president , @entity51 , said : ' you gave these children the greatest possible gift : the chance to live and to be free			1
' but you did not think of yourself as a hero because you were conducted by a desire to help those who could not defend themselves , those who were vulnerable			2
' your life is an example of humanity , selflessness , personal courage and modesty			2
' sir @entity8 was presented with a beautiful home - made birthday cake with 105 candles and a bouquet of flowers after the war , @entity8 married , cared for mentally handicapped people and built homes for the elderly sir @entity8 signing a copy of a new book about his life called if it 's not impossible written by his daughter @entity49 @entity7 prime minister @entity51 wrote a letter of thanks to sir @entity8 dear sir @entity8 , by means of this letter i would like to congratulate you on your important jubilee that you are celebrating today			1
i would like to convey greetings and congratulations to you from the capital of a country where people remember your name in relation to an extraordinary heroic deed that arouses respect , esteem and gratitude across the generations			2
that is why i write to you , not only on my behalf but on behalf of many of my fellow @entity100 is made up of people 's stories and their often complex fates			0
it is especially those who did not originally intend to become famous and did not see their deeds as exceptional who usually make their mark in history and are remembered			0
such people only did what they considered to be the right thing , to the best of their knowledge and belief			0
they did not think about what such behaviour would bring them or whether it would make them famous			0
and this is exactly what makes them heroes who are so much needed by each chapter of human history , if it is to serve as a lesson and inspiration for @entity130 the verge of @entity18 , disregarding the danger to yourself , your personal commitment helped to save 669 @entity12 children , mainly @entity4 , who would otherwise have faced prison , war hardships and often death			2
you gave then the greatest gift you could give them : the possibility to live and be free			0
however , you did not consider yourself to be a hero and the motive for what you did was your desire to help those who could not defend themselves and were vulnerable			0
only many years after did the world learn about your heroism , which was and still is most greatly appreciated by the gratefulness of those whom you have @entity8 , your life story is exceptional for a number of reasons			1
first and foremost , it is a role model of humanity , unselfishness , personal courage and humbleness			0
that is why i have decided to confer upon you on the occasion of our @entity161 on 28th october this year , the @entity42 , the highest decoration of the @entity7			2
i would hereby like to invite you to @entity165 where i would like to confer upon you this decoration in @entity167 would like to wish you all the best , good health , a lot of personal happiness and vitality			0
and allow me to wish us all to have the strength to draw inspiration from such life stories as yours , for without them there would be no hope for human @entity181 regards , @entity51 recognized : he was knighted by @entity183 in 2002 ( pictured ) and has been the subject of a film			0
next month , his daughter is releasing a book about her father the @entity189 reported that at the reception in the @entity7 embassy sir @entity8 said : ' i am always surprised every time i come here to see all kinds of people who have come really very great distances to say hello			1
' as far as i am concerned , it is only @entity198 that i am fighting – i am not ill , i am just old and doddery			0
and i am more doddery than old			0
' it was 1938 and violence was escalating against @entity4 people in @entity202 when sir @entity8 , then just 29 , travelled to @entity165 on holiday			1
unassuming : @entity8 was 29 when he went to @entity165 and made a list of children to be saved as the @entity206 marched into @entity12 , sir @entity8 - who had no experience or connections in this sort of work - decided that he would see if he could save people			1
he had actually booked a holiday to go skiing in @entity215 , but changed his plans at the last minute when a friend involved in @entity4 refugee work asked him for help			0
in a special interview with @entity221 ' 60 minutes last week , he said : ' all i knew was that the people that i met could n't get out			0
' and they were looking of ways of at least getting their children out ... i work on the motto that if something 's not impossible , there must be a way of doing it			2
' when he returned to @entity22 , he had lists of hundreds of children and started trying to convince the @entity2 authorities to take them			1
the stockbroker pretended to be more official than he was by taking stationery from an established refugee organization , adding ' @entity240 ' to its header and making himself chairman , @entity221 reported			0
he admitted it took ' a little smoke and mirrors ' to convince authorities to believe him - but he said it mostly took getting a printing press to print the paper			0
he continued his work as a stockbroker by day , before returning to the office to work on getting the children to the @entity2			1
his mother and volunteers also helped at the office			0
sir @entity8 said he contacted @entity260 authorities to take the children , but they said they were unable			1
but @entity2 authorities said they would take them if @entity8 found each one a home , so he got to work advertising their pictures so that families would take them			1
when he had secured them homes , the youngsters were ready to leave - but he found that the @entity2 authorities were slow to issue their travel documents			1
desperate to help the children get out , he forged their documents and also paid off officials , he said			1
' took a bit of blackmail on my part , ' he admitted			0
that 's the main thing			0
' the first children left @entity165 on march 14 , 1939 - just hours before @entity282 troops occupied @entity165			2
eventually , seven trains carried more than 600 children to @entity285 , where they caught ferries to @entity288			2
the @entity206 allowed them to leave , happy that the country was being ' cleansed ' of @entity4			2
saved : among the children saved were 14 - year - old @entity291 , left , and 10 - year - old @entity292 , right thankful : @entity291 , who now lives in @entity293 , @entity294 , said she only heard @entity8 's name after 50 years survivor : @entity292 said he was always hopeful that he would return home and find his parents on december 2 , 1938 , @entity4 and @entity299 agencies began rescuing @entity282 and @entity300 @entity4 children on @entity302 ( children 's transports )			1
the @entity305 , a group under the auspices of the @entity307 or @entity308 , which later became the @entity310 organisation , urged concerned @entity299 and @entity4 to support @entity15			0
an extensive fund - raising effort was organized and the @entity2 public responded generously , raising £ 500,000 in six months			2
a large portion of this money was used to care for the children who were rescued			2
between december 1938 and may 1940 , almost 10,000 children , infants to teenagers , were rescued and given shelter at farms , hostels , camps , and in private homes in @entity2			1
however , this effort did not include the children of @entity12 ; and this is why the work of @entity8 was so vital			1
another train was scheduled to leave on september 1 , but was stopped by the declaration of war			0
sir @entity8 said he has reason to suspect not many of those children survived			1
at the reception in the @entity7 embassy sir @entity8 said : ' i am always surprised every time i come here to see all kinds of people who have come really very great distances to say hello			1
' as far as i am concerned , it is only @entity198 that i am fighting – i am not ill , i am just old and doddery			0
and i am more doddery than old			0
' after the war , sir @entity8 trained pilots for the @entity345 , married , raised a family and lived comfortably			1
he cared for mentally handicapped people and built homes for the elderly			0
but he hardly told anyone about what he had done			0
but in 1988 , his wife @entity352 found a scrapbook in their attic listing the names of the children , their parents and the families that had taken them			2
later that year , the @entity360 learned about the story and sir @entity8 was invited onto its @entity363 show , where he met scores of the children he had saved			1
in 2002 , he was knighted , and he was also celebrated in a documentary called ' @entity367 '			0
found : a letter dated 1939 and written to president @entity369 has been found in the @entity370			0
it asks the @entity260 for help granting refuge to @entity202 children plea : it is signed by sir @entity8 - then a young @entity22 stockbroker who made it his mission to save children questions : archives show that the letter was passed on to @entity260 officials for a decision on what to do inquiries : the archivist found a letter to the president 's @entity390 on political refugees			1

sir @entity8 organised the transport of 669 children to the @entity2
without him , they would almost certainly have been *killed* by the @entity206
almost all of their parents went on to die in @entity13 concentration camps
he forged documents and bribed officials before he could get them out
@entity8 , who is now 105 , kept his story quiet for nearly 50 years
even the children he transported did not know he had saved them
now the @entity7 will honour him for saving its children
