from @entity0 and @entity1 to @entity2 and @entity3 , if you like apples then @entity6 is your man			1
he has 250 varieties available to pick – and astonishingly , they ’re all growing on just one tree			1
the horticulturist has spent 24 years meticulously developing the tree in his back garden in @entity12 , near @entity13 , @entity14 , grafting on new varieties every winter			1
@entity18 turnover : @entity6 in the apple tree in his garden in @entity12 , near @entity13 , @entity14 , on which two hundred and fifty different apple varieties grow @entity22 : @entity6 has grafted 250 varieties on the ' family tree ' over the past two decades fruitful : there are 6,000 apple varieties worldwide and over 2,000 different types kept at the @entity28 in @entity29 the tree ’s fruits now include rare cooking apples such as the @entity33 , which originated in 1883 , and @entity35 ’s @entity34 , from 1908 , as well as more recognisable favourites			1
mr @entity6 , 40 , said yesterday : ‘ i started working at a nursery with acres of land and around 90 varieties of apple trees in rows			1
‘ i wanted to grow my own trees but i did n’t have the area to plant that number so i started a “ family tree ” where i can have all the different varieties in a smaller amount of space			1
i add to it each year by budding in the summer and grafting in the winter			0
’ for budding , a bud is cut from another apple tree and inserted into the bark of mr @entity6 ’s tree , while grafting involves the same process but usually with a small branch carrying more than one bud			1
over time the buds and branches grow to become part of the main tree and eventually produce even more varieties of apple			2
mr @entity6 added : ‘ the tree has cooking , eating and cider apples on it but i normally only get a few of each variety of apple each year			1
it ’s great to see all the different colours and sized apples on the tree this time of year			1
’ he has had to prop up some of the branches with planks because of the sheer weight of the fruit growing on the tree , which stands some 20ft high			1
he will gather his unique harvest next month , when they are at their juiciest , and show them at horticultural fairs			0
core structure : @entity6 has been grafting different kinds of apple onto the one tree , shown here , since 1989 mr @entity6 said : ‘ my favourite eating apple is @entity95 because it has a really nice flavour			1
it ’s crunchy , crisp and sweet			0
’ he said that he adds to his collection either by buying fruit from the home of the @entity28 in @entity29 – which has about 2,200 of the 6,000 known varieties – or swapping them with other apple enthusiasts			0
he said : ‘ it ’s really important for people to know what kind of apples they are growing , to know when they should be picking , eating and storing them			2
‘ there have been some varieties which have been lost over time			0
i do n’t want to see any disappear			0
you do n’t know what will happen in the future with global warming or pesticides			0
‘ you may need to crossbreed apples with older varieties to make them resistant to such things			2
‘ that ’s why every type of apple is worth preserving			0
’ fruit of his labours : @entity6 adds to his collection either by buying them in from the home of the @entity28 or swapping them with other enthusiasts mr @entity6 also has nine smaller family trees growing plums , pears , cherries and apples			1
he said : ‘ my family have always been into horticulture , so it ’s in my genes			2
my parents help me pick and tend to my garden			0
‘ my great - grandfather was particularly good with fruits so i have always grown up with people passionate about gardening			2
’ last week it was predicted that this autumn ’s harvest of apples will be one of the biggest and best tasting ever			0
@entity153 apples are some of the sweetest and most colourful for years , according to @entity155 , of @entity154 in @entity156 , @entity157			2
‘ the good weather and summer heat has upped the sugar levels in the fruit , ’ said mr @entity155 , who expects to gather in almost 2,000 tons of the fruit from his orchards			0
gala , @entity166 and @entity167 apples from the farm ’s 100 acres will be sold to all the major supermarkets after they have been gathered by a team of 36 pickers over ten days .			0

@entity6 has been growing his ' family tree ' for over 20 years
