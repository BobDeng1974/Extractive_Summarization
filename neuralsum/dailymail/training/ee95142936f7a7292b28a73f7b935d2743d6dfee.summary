it is a tale of sheer determination in the face of almost unbelievable adversity - a mountain climber left for dead after breaking his leg and tumbling into a crevasse			1
few who have read @entity10 's brilliant book touching the void , or seen the 2003 documentary of the same name , remain unmoved by the author 's bravery and incredible will to survive			1
but the 1988 work appears to have struck an entirely different chord with dozens of teenagers tasked with studying it for their gcse @entity22 literature exams			1
survivor : climber @entity10 hit back at @entity25 students who bombarded his @entity27 page with offensive posts about having to study his 1988 book touching the void decisively unimpressed with his gripping first - person account , the students took to @entity27 , branding @entity33 a ' @entity34 * * * * * ' and blaming him for failing their exams			1
but as fans of the author know only too well , he is n't the type to take things lying down , and he hit back with a series of tweets describing the sulking students as ' loathsome scroats '			1
gripping : @entity33 's incredible tale of survival has become part of mountaineering folklore the hilarious exchanges have quickly became an internet sensation with @entity33 gaining thousands of new followers in the space of a few days one angry student had tweeted : ' your book is the reason my entire year will fail our @entity22 exam ! ! learn to write you illiterate fool			1
' another ranted : ' you seem like a nice chap , but why the f * * * did you have to write that book ? ' to which @entity33 replied : ' to p * * * you off			1
' one of the most lively exchanges was with @entity67 student @entity66 who tweeted : ‘ hi joe ! i wrote you a few months ago			1
i said i had an exam about your book			1
i failed because of you			2
you owe to me ! to which @entity33 replied : ' nope , you ’re just crap at @entity22			1
' but the student hit back writing : ' i am a student who learn english ; but you are a stupid who fell down on the mountain			2
' another student wrote : ' your book is s * * * and you should feel bad			1
' and another fumed : ' three chapters of crawling did n't inspire me to write about your book in my exam			1
it was rather boring really			2
' not all the students were as unimpressed with one writing : ' i really enjoyed the book , i think i did well in my english lit @entity25 because of you : ) thanks ' but by wednesday night the author appeared to be getting more than a little hacked off : ' a lovely day of children writhing in their hellish hormonal middens … good night vile innocents may you all seethe in bilious acid pus ... ' and yesterday he declared : ' ok bored of this now so i ’ll either stop twitter or block all school kids – shame on the good ones – but the loathsome scroats can sod off ! ' abuse : some of the posts between @entity10 and the gcse students mr @entity10 told @entity105 that he had found the whole incident rather funny			1
he said : ' i suppose i deserve all the abuse i get			2
but i did find the term @entity34 * * * * * quite amusing			1
' every year when it gets to around exam time i start getting these abusive tweets			0
the funniest thing is that most of them have obviously only watched the film and not even bothered to read the book			2
' i like using @entity27 to talk to like - minded people but it 's got to the point i 'm having to block every child who tweets me			0
' at first i thought it was a great honour to have the book used as a @entity25 text but now it 's becoming a pain in the backside			2
' in 1985 , @entity10 and friend @entity125 set out to climb the treacherous west face of the @entity127 in the @entity129 andes			1
the already challenging ascent was beset with difficulties from the start as the climbers found themselves in a fierce storm and forced to tackle dangerous formations of soft powder snow			0
nevertheless they successfully reached the 21,000 ft summit on the third day			0
but as they began to make their way down disaster struck ; @entity10 slipped down an ice cliff smashing his knee and breaking his right leg			1
with no fuel left for their stoves the two men were unable to make any drinking water and with darkness drawing in they needed to climb down a further 3000ft to their base camp fast			2
@entity125 attempted to lower @entity33 down the mountain by tying two lengths of rope together			0
but in the poor conditions he accidentally lowered him off a cliff			0
they found themselves in a terrifying predicament with @entity125 unable to see or hear @entity33 or pull him back up and @entity33 too weak and frostbitten to climb up the rope himself			0
after remaining in this deadlocked position for a while , it became obvious to @entity125 that the attachments holding him to the mountain would soon give way			0
if that happened they would both be pulled to their deaths			0
@entity125 was faced with the awful decision - either die on the mountain or sacrifice his friend in order to save his own life			0
he had no choice but to cut the rope causing @entity33 to plunged 150ft into a deep crevasse			0
incredibly , despite his broken leg , @entity33 survived , landing on a small ledge inside the crevasse			1
when @entity125 reached the entrance to the crevasse he called out for his friend but , on hearing no reply , was forced to assume that he had died			0
he saw the rope had been cut and realised @entity125 would have presumed he had dead			2
freezing , injured and alone somehow @entity33 managed to abseil onto a thin ice roof a short way down the crevasse			0
from there he managed to climb back up to the glacier via a steep snow slope			0
but his ordeal had only really begun			0
from there he was forced to spend three days with no food and virtually no water , crawling hopping and clawing his way the five miles back to their base camp			0
incredibly he made it back to the tents a matter of hours before @entity125 had planned to head back			0
his story has since become mountaineering folklore .			0

climber @entity10 survived after being left for dead with a broken leg on the mountains of @entity129
