campaigners say a renewed piece of @entity5 legislation will allow federal agencies to spy on foreign nationals without warning			2
the @entity5 government granted itself the right to snoop after its secret rubber - stamping of the @entity16 ( @entity16 )			1
this means anyone abroad using the internet storage facilities provided by @entity5 companies like @entity21 , @entity22 , and @entity23 , open themselves up to investigation by the federal authorities - while @entity5 are protected because of their constitution			1
changes : the @entity5 government can spy on a foreigner 's data after quietly renewing legislation allowing them to snoop cloud computing allows internet users to store their information and data in an network server as opposed to in a physical memory stick or tangible location on their hard drive or on their smartphones			2
@entity16 was first put into place under president @entity43 in 2008 , and it was quietly renewed in december under president @entity44			1
the legislation allows a large swath of the federal government , including the @entity48 , the @entity49 , and the @entity50 , to look at any information they would like that is saved on cloud servers			2
they claim it can help them uncover crime and protect the country from terrorism			0
one of the most shocking portions of the legislation is the fact that the officials do not need to use the guise of a threat to national security as a way to justify their snooping			0
at risk : all data stored in network clouds , used by companies like @entity23 , can now be accessed by the @entity5 government round one : the @entity16 was initially signed into law by president @entity43 in 2008 ( pictured ) but was renewed by president @entity44 in december 2012 they are able to look into foreign individuals ' data for purely political reasons as well			1
a report produced about the topic stresses that it is ' much graver risk to @entity83 data sovereignty than other laws hitherto considered by @entity83 policy - makers '			0
@entity86 quoted @entity87 , who co-wrote the report which is now being examined by the @entity83 , as saying that the legislation has been so gravely ignored by @entity90 government officials			0
' it 's like putting a mind control drug in the water supply , which only affects non-americans , ' he said			0
for now , privacy advocates appear to be the only ones up in arms about the issue			0
@entity22 responded to requests made by @entity100 , saying : ' it is possible for the @entity5 government ( and @entity90 governments ) to access certain types of data via their law enforcement agencies			1
we think this kind of access to data merits serious discussion and more transparency			0
