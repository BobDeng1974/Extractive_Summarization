mr @entity8 told the age on wednesday evening he refused to condemn @entity4 's actions , taking a swipe at authorities for taking an ' enforcement ' approach to the threat of terrorists at home			1

he was known to police , recently has his passport cancelled , and had been monitored by officers for the past three months			0
