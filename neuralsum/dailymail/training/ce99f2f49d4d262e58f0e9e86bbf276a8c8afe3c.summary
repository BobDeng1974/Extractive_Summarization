' devastating effect ' : staff from the @entity12 branch of @entity4 plastered their photos in the window of the store in the hope of finding new employment around 1,370 shop staff were left jobless when @entity4 closed its 187 stores across the @entity37 last week			1
further redundancies at the chain 's head office in @entity41 also look likely			2
' loyal staff ' : mr @entity18 's picture beneath the sign featuring the staff 's call for help mr @entity18 , 44 , said their window display - which also includes a sign that reads : ' what 's happening to our high streets ? ' - had created quite a stir in the town centre			1
' it 's brought quite a bit of attention , ' said mr @entity18 , who said people had come in to sympathise with the team as they packed away stock and equipment inside the closed store			1
' we have had literally hundreds of people knocking on our doors to tell us how sorry they were that we were going , ' said the former salesman , who had worked for @entity4 for around four years			2
' they were saying it 's now almost impossible to get your photos printed in the centre of town			2
' we were packing up the goods for the administrators			2
it was really quite distressing			2
' each member of staff at the store was completely passionate about photography			1
' i 'm actually a photographer myself			2
i worked there because i genuinely liked it			0
' the team 's collective enthusiasm for their work made the news of their fate all the more devastating according to mr @entity18 , who said staff only learned of the chain 's collapse when a journalist called the @entity12 branch for a comment			1
' it was really out of the blue , ' he said			0
' we had no warning			0
' i 've seen my colleagues crying , wondering how they are going to pay their rents			0

high street casualty : all 187 @entity4 stores nationwide have ceased trading final days : customers browse in the @entity110 branch of @entity4 on the day before stores across the country closed their doors mr @entity18 , who in the meantime intends to concentrate on his professional photographic work after losing his position at @entity4 , said this latest retail casualty indicated a bleak future for the @entity25 @entity24			1
' when @entity120 went down i did pay it some attention , but it does n't really hit you until it happens to you , ' said mr @entity18 , adding that @entity4 had struggled to compete with internet retailers			1
' people were coming in for our expert advice , then using that to buy stock online , ' he said			0
' i do think we could have adapted better			0
it is a crying shame			0
as @entity25 's only specialist camera retailer , @entity4 had been a fixture on high streets nationwide for almost 80 years			1
its collapse followed that of a number of familiar high street names over the course of last year , including fellow camera retailer @entity139 in june 2012 , and @entity120 in november			1
@entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 also went under last year			0
shocked by the disappearance of @entity4 from @entity25 's high streets - and the loss of more than 1,000 jobs - a photography firm has offered an apprenticeship to one of the stricken chain 's former employees			0
@entity153 , pictured right , who runs @entity156 - based @entity155 , said the firm was keen to take on an apprentice and had decided to offer it to someone affected by @entity4 ' collapse			0
' it 's terrible that , in one year , @entity139 , @entity4 and @entity120 have disappeared from our high streets , leaving very limited options for camera buyers and photography enthusiasts , ' mr @entity153 said			1
' we already have one apprentice and strongly believe in bringing young enthusiastic people on board to grow with us			0
' mr @entity153 said whoever was selected for the year - long apprenticeship could potentially go on to a long - standing career with the firm			2
' young people in the @entity37 nowadays get a rough deal , ' he said			2
' there are many talented and passionate people who simply can not get a break			0
' i really believe that apprenticeships are a great way to find your feet in an industry that is increasingly difficult to break into , ' he added			0
former @entity4 employees interested in applying for the apprenticeship with @entity187 should e-mail their cv to @entity189			0
the apprenticeship is subsidised , and the successful candidate will gain an hnd in photography over the course of the year .			0
