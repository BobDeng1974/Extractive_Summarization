defender @entity0 believes @entity1 have become a stronger unit from their @entity4 success of last season , but can not allow themselves any sense of complacency against @entity8 at @entity9 in saturday 's @entity4 semi-final			1
the @entity11 head into the tie on the back of a superb run of form , which has seen them win 16 from 18 matches in all competitions and up into second place in the @entity20			1
the atmosphere around the club is certainly a world way from the tense finale to the 2013/14 campaign , when @entity1 were under extreme pressure in the quest to finally end a near decade wait for silverware as well as finish in the top four of the @entity20 once again , not to mention the uncertainty around the future of manager @entity33			1
per @entity0 will not allow @entity1 to become complacent in @entity4 semi-final against @entity8 mertesacker pictured during a training session with his @entity1 team - mates on friday ahead of the clash @entity39 looked in good spirits as he cheered on his team - mates during their training session @entity43 reacts as @entity44 laughs during training as they prepare to defend their @entity4 win those ambitions were within eight minutes of being shattered when trailing 1 - 0 to @entity49 in their semi-final 12 months ago , before @entity0 made amends for giving away an earlier penalty when heading home a late equaliser to force extra-time and a nerve - shredding penalty shoot - out victory that in turn set up a final against @entity59 , which itself proved just as dramatic as @entity1 came from 2 - 0 down to lift the trophy			1
' it is a good warning to all of us			2
you need to be focused 100 per cent @entity8 , so it is going to be a tough one for us , ' said the @entity66 , who will again lead the team out at @entity9 with captain @entity69 still not fit			1
we suffered a bit last season on that occasion with that pressure , but it was a great experience and hopefully we can manage that a bit better			2
' we are on a good level of confidence , but there will be pressure on us because we are super favourites and can we handle that during the game ? ' @entity0 added : ' it is going to be @entity8 's biggest game of the season , so to mentally prepare for that is going to be difficult , not just to match their physicality and mental strength , but to do more , to be on the ball from the start , to show them respect , but no fear for the pressure			1
' the winning streak helps us a bit , but this competition is completely different			2
@entity1 manager @entity33 pictured during training as he prepares to face @entity98 club @entity8 @entity1 's stars were put through their paces ahead of the short trip from north @entity102 to @entity9 @entity103 and @entity104 acknowledge each other during the @entity1 training session on friday ' it is the best competition i have ever played in because so many big teams struggle , but i do n't want to struggle			1
i want to repeat the success ( of 2014 ) , so let 's make sure that we are on the same level and do more than our opponent			2
' i feel that we are really sharp and eager to repeat it			0
we have the chance to do it because we did well before and that is something i want to build on			0
' mertesacker believes the squad have it within themselves to sustain a challenge for honours in the coming seasons			0
the @entity66 continued : ' to go on or to be consistent - that is a tough target , but we push ourselves			1
' we want to be able to defend a title and be able to compete at the top which makes us at the moment a good team			0
we have n't shown that consistently this season because all of a sudden we lost one game [ in the @entity134 last 16 first leg to @entity135 ] and in a cup competition you can not afford that			2
' even in the @entity20 , if you lose four games , you can not win the title , so that is something we really try to push ourselves to the next level			0
' @entity1 won the @entity4 last year and will be trying to defend their trophy this season once more @entity146 and @entity103 during training in @entity102 on friday morning ahead of saturday 's semi-final the bedrock of @entity1 's resurgence has been the return to fitness of key men , which has left the likes of @entity156 , @entity44 and @entity157 all looking on from the bench			1
@entity159 could be another in contention this weekend , having recovered from minor ankle surgery			0
mertesacker believes such strength in depth can only be a positive for the squad 's development			0
' it is weird , but it is really good , the competition we have got at the moment			0
it is really something that lifts everyone at the club , ' he said			0
' obviously there are going to be a few disappointing situations for players , but we have to respect the manager 's decision and not to let anyone down , if someone is not in the squad			0

the @entity66 defender will not allow complacency to *creep* in however
