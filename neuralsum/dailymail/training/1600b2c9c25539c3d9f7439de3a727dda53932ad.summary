but that comes at a price – those who have their tests covered by the company are required to sign a waiver saying the screenings were voluntary			0
if workers refuse to sign up , they will be charged an extra $ 50 a month , or $ 600 a year			1
however , the policy has been called ‘ technology - enhanced discrimination ’ by dr @entity49 , the founder of @entity50			2
she told @entity51 that the policy insinuates that workers need to be penalized in order to get into shape			2
' the approach they ’re taking is based on the assumption that somehow these people need a whip , ' she said			0

to encourage a higher level of participation in our wellness review , we reviewed best practices and determined that an additional cost for those who do not complete the review was the most effective way to incent our colleagues to improve their health care and manage health costs			0
@entity2 is committed to providing medical coverage and healthcare programs for our colleagues and privacy is rigorously protected , consistent with @entity147 regulations			2
all personal health data from these screenings are collected and reviewed by a third - party administrator that supports the @entity152 , and this data is not shared with @entity2 — rather it is designed to help employees make the best decisions about their own healthcare .			1

those who ' opt out ' will be *subject* to extra $ 50 fee each month , or $ 600 per annum
