it is , say royal insiders , the duchess of @entity4 's ' secret weapon ' for staying in shape			1
so it 's no surprise that smoothie - maker the @entity9 has become a must - have device			1
the gadget , which pulverises fruit , vegetables , nuts and seeds , is known as an ' extractor ' rather than a juicer or blender , due to its unique high - powered blade action			1
it 's this , manufacturers say , which is the key to retaining the nutritional content in your smoothie			1
today , @entity26 is offering readers the chance to buy one , along with a recipe book detailing how you can use it , and other bonus items as part of an incredible half - price deal			1
but , as adults , many of us do it a lot less , meaning that we absorb fewer vitamins and minerals			2
this , coupled with the fact that digestive enzymes deplete as we grow older , means that by middle age , we 're often not getting the best from our diets , even if we 're trying to eat well			2
this is where the @entity37 comes in			2
why ' extracting ' is the key despite its small size , the @entity9 's 600w motor and extractor blades are enough to turn even heartier vegetables , fruit and ice into smooth drinks in a process called ' nutrition extraction '			1
when you consume this nutrition - extracted food , according to the gadget 's makers , you spare the digestive system the work of breaking down dense and fibrous foods , allowing it to focus on absorbing the maximum amount of nutrients locked inside			1
slimmer , happier , healthier at the core of the @entity9 plan is the @entity91 – a smoothie comprising 50 per cent greens and 50 per cent fruit , plus two to four tablespoons of ' boosts ' ( nuts , seeds or other super-charged foods )			1
to make a @entity98 , you always follow this method , but tailor the ingredients depending on the results you want – whether it 's better sleep , cardiovascular health , or stronger muscles			1
it could n't be simpler – just swap breakfast or lunch for a filling smoothie			1
over the following pages , we 've provided inspiring recipes to help you get started , but you can always create your own blend			2
just remember : half greens , half fruit and veg , and those ' boosts '			2
now , turn over , choose your recipes … and introduce a daily @entity91 to your balanced diet			2
by @entity119 , health editor contrary to recent reports , drinking juices and smoothies will not make you fat			2
but if you are expecting to add one of these tasty blends to a diet of chips , chocolate biscuits and lashings of wine , and still reap some kind of miraculous health benefit , you ’ll be disappointed			0
most doctors will tell you there is no such thing as unhealthy food – it ’s an unhealthy diet that is a problem			1
the good news is that this means you can indulge in the odd burger or slice of cake			0
but if you eat these all the time , at best you ’ll be consuming unhealthy foods at the expense of far better choices			0
at worst , you ’ll be overweight and on your way to a heart attack			0
a despairing dietician once told me that she has unwell , obese patients who ignore all her advice , yet gamely inform her that they are drinking ‘ a whole carton of orange juice every day now ’ , alongside their usual four cans of cola			1
sadly , one does n’t magically counteract the other			0
juices and smoothies are concentrated and so make gulping down large quantities of fruit sugars in one sitting easy			0
in some cases , they contain more sugar than a can of cola			0
a litre a day is too much , but a small glass of orange juice as part of a healthy , balanced diet ( where cake and coke is a rare treat rather than a regular item ) will provide vitamins , minerals and other nutrients in a convenient way			1
the @entity40 recipes here contain vegetables ( naturally lower in sugar ) , as well as fruit and seeds , and nuts or cereals to increase the satiating fibre content – making them a really good choice			1
one a day will do you heaps of nutritional favours as long as it ’s not used to wash down a fast - food takeaway			1
the boring truth is that there is no quick fix when it comes to diet , and a smoothie - maker wo n’t change your life			1
but if you have resolved this year to eat a better , more balanced diet , then getting one of these is certainly a brilliant place to start			0
bananas are a great way to boost your fibre intake , which can help prevent heart disease and diabetes and improve digestive health			0
a medium - sized banana contains 3g of fibre , a sixth of the recommended daily intake			1
if you ’re craving carbs , opt for sweet potatoes			0
they are a good source of fibre , help stabilise blood sugar , and contain nearly three times your daily @entity224 allowance , which is essential for healthy vision			2
blueberries are loaded with @entity227 and @entity228 and fibre			0
a study of 93,000 women found those who ate at least three portions a week reduced their heart - attack risk by a third			2
raw cacao powder has nearly four times the antioxidant content of dark chocolate			0
antioxidants help to combat free radicals			0
often avoided by dieters , avocados are high in fibre to keep you fuller for longer , and contain beneficial fats to lower cholesterol			2
just one papaya contains twice the recommended daily allowance of @entity248 enzyme called papain can be extracted from the papaya and applied to skin to treat infected wounds			0
oats contain soluble fibre called oat beta - glucan , which helps prevent cholesterol in food being absorbed into our bodies			1
adding almonds to your diet could lower your risk of type 2 diabetes			0
a @entity265 study found people who consumed a fifth of their daily calories by eating almonds had lower levels of ‘ bad ’ cholesterol			0
leafy green kale contains folate , a b vitamin central to brain development			0
it can also be beneficial for heart health			0
@entity279 soothes the digestive system and also encourages perspiration , so it can help reduce fevers by cooling the body .			0

the @entity40 is said to be @entity285 of @entity4 's ' secret weapon '
the smoothie - maker has now become a must - have device for healthy living
it uses a high - powered blade action to extract , rather than juice , food
