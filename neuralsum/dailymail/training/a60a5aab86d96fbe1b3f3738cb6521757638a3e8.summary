authorities said he does not look anything like the suspect sketch put together by witness statements ( right ) links ? as well as going to school with 2 of the victims and working with another , @entity10 also worked at this @entity98 store , which could explain the large military boot - print found at one crime scene some of the facts appear to add up , @entity32 reported			1
