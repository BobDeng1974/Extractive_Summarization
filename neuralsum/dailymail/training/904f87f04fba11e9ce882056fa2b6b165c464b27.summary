her gp put a care plan in place which stipulated the grandmother - of - two needed to be turned every two hours to prevent her joints becoming stiff			0
but six months later , doctors discovered she was weak , dehydrated and suffering from pressure sores			1
@entity36 showed on one occasion she was not turned for a shocking 13 hours			0
her joints were so stiff she had become fused into the foetal position and she was transferred to @entity39 where doctors discovered a pressure sore on her bottom which was graded at level four - the most serious grading			0
it was discovered the sore had become infected with @entity4 and she was treated for blood poisoning before being transferred to @entity46 , in @entity47 - on - @entity48 , @entity28 , on november 21 , 2008 , but died just three days later			1
her family sued the care home and last week @entity51 , which runs @entity24 , agreed a five figure sum out - of - court settlement			1
today , her daughter @entity54 blasted care staff for their ' unforgivable ' care			1
she said : ' when she was admitted to hospital , doctors told us that her body was fused in the foetal position , suggesting it was likely because she had barely been turned			0
' @entity64 was in a very vulnerable condition , but we all put our trust in the care home believing that they were doing their best for her			2
' they reassured us they could care for her needs , but as the weeks went by we started to seriously question the quality of care she was given			0
' @entity64 was passionate about teaching high standards of nursing care			0
for her to die in this way is unforgivable			0
' totally let down ' : mrs @entity3 's family paid £ 2,000 - a - month for her to have round - the - clock care at @entity24 care home ( pictured ) in @entity26 - on - @entity27 , @entity28 , after she developed dementia ' @entity64 used to always say one of the fundamentals of nursing care was to make sure that your patient avoided a pressure sore ' she added : ' she dedicated her life to caring for others , but when she was reliant upon others to care for her , she was totally let down			1
' she spent her last weeks in agony and did not get the care she deserved			0
her death has devastated the entire family			0
' we are so angry about the level of care she received , from a care home that she was paying over £ 2,000 per month of her hard earned savings for			2
' but this was never about the money , we 've never had an apology and we still do not feel we have all the answers as to why she was not regularly turned by care home staff who should have known better			2
' @entity110 , a solicitor for @entity111 who represented the family , said : ' despite a very clear care plan , the instructions were not fully implemented by the care home staff			1
' the care home 's records show that on one occasion @entity3 was left for 13 hours without being moved			1
' @entity54 is understandably distraught by her mother 's death and , in particular , the fact that severe pressure sores were allowed to develop to the extent that they did			1
' pressure sores of this kind are completely avoidable if proper care and procedures are followed			1
' the care home currently has a clean bill of health from the @entity133 , based on a range of self - assessments and formal inspections			2
a spokesman for @entity51 said : ' we offer our sincere condolences to mrs @entity3 's family and regret that on this occasion the standard of care fell below the level we require and expect			2
' @entity51 prides itself on its quality of care but we clearly let mrs @entity3 down and we are very sorry			0
' since 2008 new systems have been implemented to assist and monitor the management of pressure sores			2
' our way of working has changed completely and is audited at group level as well as at each home			0
