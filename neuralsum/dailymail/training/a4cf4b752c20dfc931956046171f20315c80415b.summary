in 2013 , @entity0 killed 1,792 cats and dogs , an average of 5 per day			2
the 1,792 figure represents 82 percent of all animals @entity0 took into its shelter throughout the year			1
' this delusional animal rights group is talking out of both sides of its mouth – on one side preaching animal rights , while on the other signing the death warrant of 82 percent of cats and dogs in its care			1
labeling @entity0 as hypocritical would be the understatement of the year , ' said @entity57 from the @entity10			0
