by @entity0 published : 17:56 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 17:59 est , 8 january 2014 women who give birth after @entity6 treatment are up to five times as likely to suffer from serious complications , researchers have found			1
the most comprehensive study of its kind concluded that babies born as a result of fertility treatment are more likely to be severely underweight , stillborn , born prematurely or die only a few weeks after birth			0
scientists analysed records from more than 300,000 births that took place in @entity19 between 1986 and 2002			1
dangers : babies conceived under @entity6 treatment were five times more likely to suffer serious complications , a study found ( @entity24 photo ) the figures excluded multiple births , which are more common after fertility treatment and carry more risks			1
researchers found that women who had any kind of fertility treatment were roughly twice as likely to suffer a stillbirth , a premature birth , have a very underweight baby or a child that died in the first month as the ones who conceived naturally			0
and when @entity6 was looked at exclusively , they discovered that the likelihood of complications was up to five times higher			2
the riskiest births of all involved women who had suffered fertility problems but then managed to conceive naturally			2
although these women tended not to have been treated at a fertility clinic , many could have been prescribed fertility - boosting drugs by their gp – or may have bought them over the internet in their desperation to start a family			0
complications : an analysis of 300,000 births in @entity19 found babies born as a result of fertility treatment were more likely to be underweight , stillborn , born prematurely or die after a few weeks this meant they could have been taking more than the recommended dose , and would not have benefited from the regular , intensive health checks that a clinic would have provided			1
the team of scientists from @entity65 said the complications could have been caused by the drugs used during treatment , or by the medical problems that had originally led the women to use @entity6			1
complications could be caused by the drugs used during fertility treatment , researchers from @entity65 found			1
( @entity24 photo ) lead researcher professor @entity76 , who has previously linked fertility treatment to birth defects , said some problems may have been caused by embryos starting life in a lab dish , rather than in the womb			0
and he explained that the powerful drugs used to boost the number of eggs a woman produces create a ‘ hormonal hang - over ’ which can affect both the womb and the placenta			0
professor @entity76 also warned that there is an ‘ urgent need ’ to track the long - term health of babies born through @entity6			0
he added : ‘ it is appropriate that we are informed of the risks associated with the therapy and the source of that risk , so we can make informed decisions			0
’ around 50,000 women in the @entity104 have @entity6 each year leading to 17,000 births			1
dr @entity106 , medical director of the @entity108 fertility clinic , said doctors should make @entity6 ‘ as safe as possible ’ by not using high doses of drugs			2
but dr @entity114 , an @entity115 fertility expert , said : ‘ although this study suggests the risk of some adverse outcomes is higher in pregnancies conceived using @entity6 , the overall risk of these problems remains low			2
‘ as such , i doubt that these findings will deter many infertile couples from using @entity6			0
