by @entity1 reporter published : 17:52 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 18:33 est , 11 december 2012 money rolling in : @entity5 justice @entity3 earned $ 1.2million from a new book contract @entity5 justice @entity3 revealed the fact that her ex-husband brought a bag of @entity10 to his new wife on their wedding night			1
she also told other unusually personal stories about her upbringing in the @entity16 , like how she unknowingly brought her cousin to a drug den where he shot up heroin			1
@entity3 went on to describe how her personal health battle with diabetes caused her to fear dying at a young age and , in turn , stopped her from having children			2
@entity5 @entity3 told of these intimate stories about her upbringing in her memoir , titled ' @entity28 ' , which is due to be released in january			1
the @entity29 received an early copy of the book and previewed some of the most interesting anecdotes about the justice 's upbringing			1
given her position as one of the three - serving female judges on the country 's highest bench , @entity3 wrote only about her life leading up to her judicial career , purposefully avoiding any potential conflicts of interest			2
much of the book is spent discussing @entity3 's underprivileged upbringing in the @entity16 , where her family was so poor that they never had a bank account			1
the ' world ' that the book 's title refers to is one in which her @entity53 parents and her siblings only spoke @entity57 and not @entity56 in their tenement apartment			1
growing up : @entity3 was raised by her @entity53 parents in a tenement in the @entity16 , and the family was so poor that they did not have a bank account one potentially political stance that @entity3 takes in the book is one of support for affirmative action as she credits it to the reason why she was admitted to @entity69 and @entity70			1
she say that it is needed to get disadvantaged students to the starting line of a race to success			2
she acknowledges she entered through a special door reserved for minority students but writes that her accomplishments at @entity69 - including receiving the highest prize given to seniors , earning a place in the @entity83 honor society and graduating with highest honors - speak for themselves			2
valuing education : one of the few political statements @entity3 ( seen here at her eighth grade graduation ) makes in the book is a defense of affirmative action since she said she benefited from the policy the up - from - poverty story is in many respects similar to the one told by her @entity5 seatmate , justice @entity94 , in ' @entity95			1
' both grew up with few creature comforts and ran into prejudice on a regular basis			1
but where @entity94 has become a strong opponent of affirmative action and says he felt stigmatized by the racial preference that also helped him get into @entity70 , @entity3 says she took the opportunity to join the elite and ran with it			2
she acknowledges that her @entity109 heritage played a role in her rise to the @entity5 , where she is the first @entity112 and third woman to be a justice			1
she says she has never let slurs about her roots or put - downs based on her gender get the best of her			2
one thing that has plagued her throughout her life , however , has been her struggles with diabetes			2
@entity3 has spoken publicly and movingly about her diabetes before			0
she told children with diabetes that she suspected something was wrong when she started wetting her bed			0
in her book , @entity3 relates several instances where she blacked out and was found unconscious , including by a roommate at @entity69 , a client in @entity132 , @entity133 , and a friend 's barking dog			0
she said such episodes were never frequent and have been rare in the last decade			0
making a statement : she wrote a thankful message to her friends and professors in the @entity69 yearbook the disease may have been a big part of her decision not to have children , but @entity3 says that partly as a result , she is godmother to more children than anyone she knows			0
her beloved cousin @entity149 comes up in the book , who eventually died of @entity152 that she said he contracted through a contaminated needle			0
@entity3 says she was working as a prosecutor when she gave @entity149 a lift to what he told her only after the fact was a drug den in the @entity160 section of the @entity16 and waited for him in her car while he shot up heroin inside			1
the book also gives a look into her romantic life , detailing her marriage to her high school sweetheart , @entity166 , soon after they graduated from college			1
they divorced during @entity3 's time as a prosecutor in @entity172 , but parted amicably			0
missing children : @entity3 , seen here with her niece in an undated photo , said that her fear of dying young due to diabetes kept her from having or adopting children one detail @entity3 notes is that on their wedding night , @entity181 produced a bag of @entity10 - the hynotic - sedative that was popular in the 1970s - that was a gift from his friends			0
she insisted he flush the pills down the toilet			0
she says she used to smoke three - and - a - half packs of cigarettes a day , until she saw her young niece holding a pencil between her fingers and blowing imaginary rings of smoke			0
she spent five days in a residential program to quit smoking and says she has n't had a cigarette since			0
but she could imagine lighting up one more time on her deathbed , as her grandmother did			0
making the contrast between @entity3 's past and present lives , she is taking home $ 1.2million from the book , which is due to be published simultaneously in @entity56 and @entity57 in the new year .			0
