by @entity0 published : 20:30 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 05:30 est , 19 october 2012 the @entity1 was at the centre of a new controversy over @entity4 last night after it emerged that a planned @entity6 investigation on the scandal may be delayed			2
staff on the @entity10 current affairs show confirmed yesterday that they had previously been told that the ‘ quick - turnaround ’ programme would be going out on monday			1
contributors were also informed that the investigation was going to air the night before @entity1 director - general @entity16 ’s appearance in front of the culture , media and sport select committee on tuesday			1
new controversy : the airing of a @entity6 investigation into the allegations surrounding sir @entity4 , pictured at @entity25 in 2003 , may be delayed timely : any delay would mean the show is aired after @entity1 director - general @entity16 appears before mps over the @entity30 allegations on tuesday but now it has emerged that the @entity1 could move the show to later in the week , blaming the fact that it might not be ready for monday			1
this would mean any damaging revelations would air after the @entity1 chief had appeared in front of @entity28			2
@entity37 , editor of @entity6 , said yesterday that his team were ‘ working very hard ’ to get the show on air as soon as they could			0
panorama editor @entity37 said his team are working ' very hard ' to get the show aired as soon as possible but one @entity28 said it would be ‘ extraordinary ’ if it did not go out on monday , while another said there would ‘ need to be a very good reason why not ’			2
former @entity47 political editor @entity46 , now at @entity48 , described the fact that @entity6 was set to go out the night before mr @entity16 ’s appearance as a ‘ huge problem ’ for him			0
the programme is in part expected to probe what role executives including mr @entity16 and director of news @entity55 had in the decision to drop a @entity47 investigation into @entity4 ’s activities			1
critics have suggested that the programme was dropped to protect the corporation ’s reputation , but the @entity1 has repeatedly denied that any pressure was put on @entity47 editor @entity65 to pull the investigation			0
the suggestion that the @entity6 programme could be moved back has raised new questions about the @entity1 ’s handling of the issue			0
conservative mp @entity72 , who chairs the committee which will be interviewing mr @entity16 , said : ‘ given that one of the major issues is the suggestion that the @entity1 has been trying to suppress an investigation into this issue , if it were not transmitted on monday there would need to be a very good reason			1
’ @entity82 mp @entity81 , who also sits on the committee , said of the potential @entity6 delay : ‘ i find that extraordinary and would expect @entity85 to give a full explanation when he comes before the committee			0
’ yesterday the @entity1 was asked by women ’s groups to investigate whether ‘ institutional sexism ’ was partly to blame for the alleged abuse by @entity4			0
apology : the director - general of the @entity1 @entity16 has previously issued a ' profound and heartfelt apology ' to @entity4 's victims investigation : @entity98 is now investigating the @entity4 abuse case involving dozens of potential victims			1

show was meant to be broadcast on monday but now may be aired later in the week
delay would mean programme is shown after @entity1 director - general @entity16 has appeared before mps
