miss @entity0 said that all right - thinking people share outrage at the behaviour of extremist @entity4 the @entity7 ’s most prominent @entity6 presenter yesterday urged @entity9 scholars to use social media to defeat terrorist propaganda			1
the @entity13 ’s @entity12 said that theological arguments could form a ‘ counterpoint ’ to the claims made in the @entity18 ’s murder videos			1
miss @entity0 said that all right - thinking people share outrage at the behaviour of the extremist group and called for support for @entity6 campaigns against terror			1
her intervention , in an interview with the @entity27 , came amid widespread condemnation of @entity18 hostage murders , and its attempt to use horrific videos to draw support in the @entity32 , from the leading @entity34 @entity9 organisations			1
miss @entity0 , 41 , who moved to her high - profile role at the @entity37 news show last year , was asked if @entity4 in @entity34 were coming under too much pressure to apologise for every grotesque act carried out by the @entity18			1
she praised a campaign set up in east @entity41 to publicise rejection of terror by @entity34 muslims			1
‘ i think the @entity46 campaign is a very positive development because outrage is shared by all right - thinking people , ’ miss @entity0 said			1
‘ i would really like to see much more of the counterpoint from a theological perspective , with scholars taking to social media to refute the awful arguments we see put forward in those videos			2
’ a number of prominent @entity9 organisations , including the @entity57 and the @entity58 , together with local alliances of mosques , have made calls for clerics to condemn the @entity18 and its methods			1

’ @entity79 of @entity80 said that miss @entity82 's call was ' a helpful development ' she added that she found the debate about @entity6 identity in @entity34 misguided			2
‘ the emphasis on what you wear on your head or how many times you pray , on the outward things rather than what ’s in your heart and the way you treat people , i find slightly misguided , ’ she said , adding that she had not met people who called themselves @entity4 until she arrived at @entity87 in 1992			1
‘ before that people generally said @entity98 or “ of @entity100 heritage ” , ’ miss @entity0 said			1
‘ then i became aware that @entity9 was the defining bit			2
if you ’ve never been to @entity103 or @entity100 , do n’t speak the language , @entity9 is more accessible ; it has no boundaries			2
’ asked how she would described herself , she said : ‘ oh gosh ! i would say simply @entity34			0
i feel it ’s a shame that we have started to divide people much more			0
now we want to know whether people are @entity110 or @entity111			0
all these labels within communites			0
i ’m not sure how helpful it is			0
’ the rise of religious intolerance in @entity100 is recent and she had not encountered it when visiting the country as a child , she said			0
her paternal grandfather , a devout muslim from the @entity122 , married an equally devout @entity123			1
‘ i remember asking him , “ did you ever ask her to convert ? ” he just looked at me baffled , and said , “ we were both people of strong faith , and we understood each other perfectly			0
” he used to drive her to church			0
’ miss @entity0 , who was born in @entity133 , lived in the @entity134 as a child as her family moved with her doctor father ’s career			1
she said of her time living in @entity140 , when she wore a head - to - toe black abaya cloak : ‘ it was not enjoyable			0
not great in the heat			0
’ she has said that she will never wear the hijab , and also acknowledges that she drinks alcohol and does not fast during @entity146			1
miss @entity0 , who is married with three children , added that she had travelled through @entity148 as a child when her father drove the family from @entity152 to @entity41			1
‘ i remember the water wheels of @entity154 , the grandeur of @entity156 , where i felt as though i was in @entity157 , ’ she said , ‘ and driving through @entity159			0
i have never been to @entity148 since , only gazed across the border from @entity161 when speaking to @entity148 exiles there			0
’ she said the trip would be impossible today			2
@entity6 activists welcomed her intervention in the debate over @entity18 yesterday			2
@entity79 of @entity80 said : ‘ this is a helpful development			0
there is no reason why scholars should not be arguing on social media			0
