sitting front row at @entity1 is a coveted position			1
not just for the best view in the house and the chance that your neighbour might be a celebrity or @entity8 ... but for the goodie bag			0
stars , buyers and fashion editors in the ' @entity13 ' are often showered with gift bags stuffed with treats from the show sponsors			2
the @entity18 show at @entity19 on tuesday went above and beyond to impress guests , with front row attendees given a personalised tablet			1
but a few of the highly - prized gifts went missing when someone with sticky fingers - perhaps a disgruntled second row guest - decided to snap them up for themselves			2
it should be easy to spot the culprits though , as each of the tablets had been customised with wallpaper bearing their name			2
celebrities including @entity40 , and @entity39 and @entity63 were pictured fawning over their personalised @entity54 tablets before the show started			1
not a bad goodie bag : each front row guest was given an $ 899 @entity54 tablet with their gift bag at the show perks of the job : fashion editors including @entity74 editor @entity73 were among the lucky recipients , and were quick to share their haul on social media show organisers had a few back - ups of the $ 899 tablet on hand that were not customised to give to the theft victims			1
despite the drama , the show was a spectacular success , with an a-list turn - out and dazzling creations gracing the catwalk			0
@entity89 , whose designs are beloved by @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 , presented a glimmering display complete with gold , glitter , mesh and tulle			1

the star of the couture collection though was the glittery , gold metallic asymmetrical dress that not only brightened up the dull warehouse backdrop but wowed the audience with it 's high cut , off the shoulder metallic design			0
also featured alongside the asymmetrical number was a opalescent mesh two piece top and skirt with a gold , triangular panel starring centre front			0
