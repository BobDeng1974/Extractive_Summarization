by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 17:29 est , 20 february 2014 @entity3 : 17:40 est , 20 february 2014 @entity4 wo n't be @entity1 's next president , says @entity8 @entity7 rep. @entity7 , because many @entity1 voters ' are n’t ready ' for a female president and do n't hunger to break new ground the way they did with @entity13 ' i think there was a cachet about having an @entity19 - @entity1 president because of [ civil rights ] guilt , ' the outspoken conservative told @entity23 columnist @entity22 , in a piece that first ran february 18			1
' people do n’t hold guilt for a woman , ' she said , and even as @entity1 elect women at every other level of government , ' i do n't think there is a pent - up desire ' to call someone ' madam president			1
' @entity13 , @entity7 adds , had the advantage of being ' new and different , ' while mrs. @entity4 has been a fixture in @entity1 politics since the early 1990s			1
rep. @entity7 called off her presidential campaign on jan. 4 , 2012 , perhaps coming away with the idea that her gender kept her from wowing the crowds the way her arch - enemy @entity13 can last time around : @entity4 ran once in 2008 , losing a bitterly fought contest to the future president @entity13 ' based off her own personal experience , rep. @entity7 found that voters were n’t simply interested in electing a president based on their gender , ' @entity7 spokesman @entity51 told @entity52 , ' but were focused on finding a candidate based on their merits			1
' ' is n’t that what the feminist movement is all about ? ' @entity7 's months in a heated presidential primary battle during 2011 and 2012 ended quickly after details of her debilitating migraines emerged			2
she was the sole female in a nine - person @entity62 field			2
@entity4 played that role on the @entity65 side of the political ledger in 2008 , and lasted far longer than the @entity7 would four years later			0
the former @entity1 senator and first lady won the @entity69 before fading in the end and losing the nomination to @entity13			2
with @entity4 on the far left and @entity73 on the far right , there 's no love lost between the two			0
if @entity75 were to succeed her husband in the @entity77 , @entity7 said , ' effectively she would be @entity13 's third and fourth term in office ' since she was ' the godmother of @entity80 ' in 1993			2
but @entity4 is beatable , she added president @entity13 ( @entity81 ) benefited from white @entity1 ' generations - long civil - rights ' guilt , ' @entity7 told columnist @entity22 ( r ) , adding that no such bonus points were available for females ' she has a real problem when it comes to @entity90 , ' says @entity7 of the 2012 terror attack in @entity92 that unfolded during mrs. @entity4 's time as secretary of state			1
' she was in charge during the @entity90 debacle			0
if a person reads the @entity102 report and the @entity104 report released [ last ] week , it is damning for @entity4 , ' the @entity98 darling told the columnist			0
@entity7 herself is n't running for @entity107 's facing a cloud of ethics uncertainties stemming from payments her campaign - related organizations made to an @entity113 state legislator while he was stumping for her in the run - up to the 2012 @entity115			1
but @entity51 said that @entity75 's shortcomings will end her career without reaching @entity1 's political pinnacle			0
' tthe former secretary of state has many glaring challenges to address , ' he said			0
eght years later : @entity75 , now 66 , is a virtual lock for front - runner status when the @entity65 ' 2016 @entity77 scrum begins			0

there 's no ' pent - up desire ' for someone to call @entity127 president , says the @entity8 conservative *firebrand*
after running for president in 2012 , @entity7 now says the @entity1 is n't ' ready ' for a female chief *executive*
she says president @entity13 leveraged *historical* ' guilt ' over civil - rights *abuses* in order to get elected
but ' people do n't hold guilt for a woman , ' she *insists*
@entity7 , the only @entity62 woman in the 2012 race , *flamed* out after news reports exposed the *severe* migraines that kept her out of *action* for days
