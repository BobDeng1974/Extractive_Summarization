by @entity0 published : 02:16 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 04:01 est , 9 april 2013 the @entity1 has spoken of his close bonds with fellow @entity5 search and rescue crewmates in a new documentary that shows him at work			1

the first installment of the documentary series is screened next week and shows @entity9 flying a sea king helicopter to rescue a 15 - year - old boy who has fallen off a railway bridge onto some rocks in the @entity62 slate quarry in the north @entity64 town of @entity65 in @entity66			1
the @entity1 and his crewmates are seen trying to pinpoint the casualty - who has damaged his ribs and is drifting in and out of consciousness - but are hampered by bright sunlight which throws dark shadows onto the ground			2
focus : prince @entity9 said he has to analyse all the information he 's given in order to make the best judgment lifesaver : the royal qualified as an operational search and rescue captain last year and works full - time - albeit with time off for royal duties - rescuing stranded climbers and stricken casualties ( file picture ) the royal said : ' the weather was really good which makes searching a lot easier , having the sunshine out is great , but with the sunshine comes huge shadows as well and so if you 're inside those shadows you ca n't be seen very easily			1
' @entity9 is the first to spot the injured boy and he soon tells his colleagues and lands so the paramedic can assess the teenager			0
but the helicopter is low on fuel and the royal flies off to refuel leaving behind winchman / paramedic @entity103 @entity102 to look after the 15 - year - old			1
he is later airlifted to hospital when @entity9 returns and makes a full recovery			1
