for it plans to rip out even more toilets from its planes – whittling them down to just one loo per aircraft			0
no stranger to controversy : @entity3 boss @entity17 argues that the move would ultimately benefit passengers , as it ' would fundamentally lower air fares by about five per cent			1
' the move , which takes ‘ no frills travel ’ to a whole new level , could see 200 passengers vying to share one facility – forcing them either to wait in very long queues or cross their legs and pray			1
@entity17 's plan is the latest scheme from the budget airline			1
some have been implemented , while others have not			0

the airline flies only one type of aircraft type , the @entity46			2

fitting six extra seats would mean ripping out two of the three loos – leaving 200 passengers to share just one			1

@entity40 declined to be drawn on the plans , saying : ‘ we do n’t discuss those conversations			0

this move could be a step too far			0
