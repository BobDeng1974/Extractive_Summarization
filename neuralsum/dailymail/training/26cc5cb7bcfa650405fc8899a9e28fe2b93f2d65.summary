@entity0 by @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 has no chance of winning @entity5 if he continues to risk using his driver on links golf courses , insists former champion @entity9			1
@entity10 had the perfect strategy for attacking @entity12 when he won here eight years ago , avoiding fairway bunkers by using his low - flying ‘ stinger ’ iron off nearly every tee			1
but this year ’s softer conditions mean more players will consider attacking the course from the tee			2
high risk : @entity3 takes out his driver during a practice round on wednesday @entity3 has a two - iron in his bag this week but has admitted he will be using his driver just as often			1
@entity25 , who is the last @entity26 to win the @entity27 in @entity26 when he won at @entity28 in 1969 , says that could be a disastrous tactic for the @entity31			1
‘ @entity10 will have the strategy absolutely nailed down			1
he will be playing an iron a lot more than @entity0 , ’ said @entity25 on wednesday			2
‘ but @entity0 , despite being brought up on links golf , is historically not that good a links player			2
it ’s about figuring out that the game is still played on the ground here			0
’ @entity25 explained that he thought hitting drivers could only lead to problems at @entity12 and cited three links legends – @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 , who have 14 open titles between them – as the men @entity3 must emulate if he wants to improve on a record of just one top - 10 at the @entity5			1
big draw : @entity3 signs autographs for young fans during practice round at @entity54 @entity55 starts strongly at @entity12 ‘ if you hit a driver up into the elements it gives the wind longer to affect the ball , and when it lands it does n’t run as far so you ’re gaining minimal distance anyway			1
it ’s not about distance			0
all the great @entity5 champions all figured it out : keep the ball under control , avoid the hazards			0
the key to links golf is strategy and patience			2
’ @entity12 is famed for the strong winds which blow in off the @entity74 and provide the course ’s main defence			2
but the weather forecast for this week looks good with just light winds			0
@entity25 , who is at @entity12 as an ambassador for @entity80 , is hoping for a sterner test , however			1
‘ if players are taking drivers and the wind blows they ’re not going to be able to get round , ’ he said			0
‘ these courses can be horrendous when the wind blows			0
warning : former champion @entity9 ( left ) with @entity89 ‘ i remember one of the last opens i played in , at @entity28 , @entity90 was hitting driver off every tee			1
i felt like saying : “ what are you doing ? what are you trying to achieve ? ” ‘ i know links golf better than i know anything			0
i ’ve been playing it for 50 years in all conditions			0
i hope the wind blows			0
it ’s the supreme test			0

@entity3 has admitted he will be using his driver at @entity12
former champion @entity9 fears it could be a ' disastrous tactic '
@entity25 says @entity3 should follow @entity10 ' perfect strategy
