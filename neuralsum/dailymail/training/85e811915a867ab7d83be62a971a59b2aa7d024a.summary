' i was never the type of quote - unquote " disabled person " to stay in my wheelchair the entire day and have everybody wait on me , ' she says in a clip from @entity22			2
' now , she and her half - sister @entity42 - who was born just a month before @entity7 got sick - are the stars of @entity22 , which follows their lives as they endeavor to make it big in the dancing world			1
' dance is my escape and my home away from home , ' says @entity7			1

when i come to the class , i forget do n't have any			0
i 'm like , " oh , i 'm sorry about that , " to the other dancers			0
' childhood trauma : when she was just two , @entity7 ( pictured ) contracted pneumococcal sepsis , a bacterial infection that cut off her blood streams and forced doctors to amputate her limbs support system : she and her younger half - sister @entity42 ( pictured together as babies ) - are the stars of a documentary called soar , which follows their lives as sisters and dancers connection : the sisters are so close that when @entity42 ( left ) first learned to crawl , she did it by dragging her diaper on the ground like she had watched @entity7 do , instead of on all fours the documentary will not only delve into @entity7 's unique movements as a dancer , but it will also explore her one - of - a - kind bond with @entity42			1
' dance is my escape and my home away from home ' the sisters are so close , in fact , that when @entity42 first learned to crawl as a baby , she did it by dragging her diaper on the ground like she had watched @entity91 do , instead of on all fours			2
' she just grew up knowing how to help me and when to help me and when to push me away because she knew i could do it myself , ' explains @entity7 in the clip			2
encouraging : ' she is just like my mom - they do n't give me any sympathy , but they make me work for what i want to do and what i have to do , ' @entity7 ( right , as a child ) says of @entity42 partners : as they got older , @entity7 and @entity42 discovered a mutual passion for dance , and found that they could communicate through movement in their synchronized routines ' she is just like my mom - they do n't give me any sympathy , but they make me work for what i want to do and what i have to do			1

one - of - a - kind : @entity119 , the founder of @entity120 , says that their performances together create ' a rhythm and a synchronicity that is breathtaking to behold ' triumphant : @entity7 ( left , dancing with her sister , right ) is currently a fully - fledged member of @entity6 's @entity134 dance company , where she performs and choreographs ' @entity7 had to begin her motions peripherally , ' he says of their physical differences			1
' i wanted to do everything i had learned with my arms and legs , and adapt to do it without them ' ' @entity42 was given the gift of learning that from the very beginning from her sister , who did n't have the physical limbs , but had mastered the spatial limbs			1
' so when you see them dancing at the same time it 's not merely synchronized , it 's the spatial limbs preceding their physical [ ones ] in a rhythm and a synchronicity that is breathtaking to behold			0
' obstacle : @entity7 's dance career will likely be short - lived because it affects the bones in her legs , so she has to have surgeries to reshape them			1
but it has n't stopped her from pursuing her passion deeper meaning : ' when i got serious about dance , it was an expression , ' she explains			0
' [ it 's ] my voice without speaking ' @entity7 , who considered being a medical assistant before resolving to pursue a career in dance , is currently a fully - fledged member of @entity6 's @entity134 dance company , where she performs and choreographs			1
her disability means that she will likely have a short - lived dance career ; her movements onstage affect the bones in her legs , which means she has to have periodic surgeries to reshape them			2
but for now , she 's focused on pursuing her passion , whatever it takes			0
' when i got serious about dance , it was an expression , ' she explains			0
