in the last decade , thousands of @entity1 teenagers have celebrated their ' graduation ' from secondary school by hiring a limousine to travel to their prom in style			1
but it seems that they have nothing on their @entity12 peers			1
a series of fascinating new photographs highlight a trend in the city of @entity17 for throwing extravagant parties to mark the point at which young girls turn 15 and , according to @entity22 tradition , transition into womanhood			1
@entity25 , 15 , is just one of many teens who marked her coming of age - or ' quinceañera ' - by riding in not one , but several , super-bling limos with gaggles of friends , wearing matching suits and party frocks , joining in the fun			1
the glammed - up teen celebrated her quinceañera - transition into womanhood - with a lavish party is it a car , is it a nightclub ? another teen , @entity50 , smiles as she takes a seat in a lavender limo , which comes with shiny ceiling and strip lighting - perfect for partying teens parties to mark a girl 's quinceañera have become increasingly lavish with parents splashing out huge sums to ensure their youngster has a party to remember			1
however , it is n't just ' bank of mum and dad ' that pays for the event , other relatives are called upon to ' sponsor ' certain elements , for example , the cake or the @entity71 such is the pomp and ceremony of these excessive bashes , you could be forgiven for thinking that you 're looking at a garish wedding party			2
even the attending boys go to town , taking care to coordinate their looks with the birthday girl			0
much like the @entity22 prom , the celebrating girl can expect a date , with her betrothed often appearing like a mini-groom , wearing an outfit that has been planned to match hers			1
the birthday cake is likely to be just as eye - catching with ' the bigger , the better ' the remit			2
other trends include hiring a choreographer to make sure everything from the girl 's entrance into the room to her first dance has a professional touch			0
open the roof and let 's go ! partygoers climb inside the suv - limo hybrid as guests make their way to a quinceañera birthday party an early lesson in how to get in and out of a vehicle in style : one birthday girl , wearing a billowing turquoise dress , climbs aboard her limo mind the dress : other female revellers offer a helping hand , their own party dresses somewhat sober in comparison let 's hear it for the boys : complementing this birthday girl 's colour scheme were her male friends , who looked smart in braces and bowties the brighter , the better : @entity125 , dressed in a bright pink evening gown has her own moment in the spotlight , posing in a limo that has zebra - skin seats and even a bar facility video courtesy of @entity133 @entity22 communities in the @entity135 take quinceañera just as seriously with many girls incorporating popular films into their dresses			1
for example , when @entity141 released the hit film @entity143 in 2014 , it prompted a surge of @entity147 - inspired dresses			0
at the other end of the spectrum , indigenous tribes in jungle communities in the likes of @entity151 would celebrate in a much simpler fashion			0
it 's all a far cry from the more humble traditions of quinceañera			0
according to folklore , in the months before turning 15 , a daughter would be taught skills to prepare her for ensuing marriage including cooking , weaving and even tips about how to bring up her own children			0
it is thought that quinceañera has its roots in ancient @entity171 culture			2
15 is the number : quinceañera is celebrated differently in different countries but is essentially a coming - of - age party from the @entity22 communities of @entity178 to the streets of @entity12 and even in @entity180 , when a girl hits the age of 15 , a huge party promptly follows			1
essentially a coming - of - age affair , quinceañera - literally meaning ' 15 years old ' , has taken off in much the same way that the high school prom has , with celebrations and outfits becoming increasingly extravagant in recent decades			1
in the past , a girl celebrating her quinceañera would be preparing for marriage and offered advice from older females on how best to equip herself for womanhood			2
skills considered essential for being a good wife , for example sewing , cooking , cleaning and taking care of infants would be learned			0
at her quinceañera , the girl is ' presented ' to her community and may be expected to make a speech			0
after an ' acceptance ' of the girl , the party - goers would then pray before a meal is served			2
although most historians agree that the celebration has its roots in @entity171 culture , how it is celebrated now depends very much on the country the girl grows up in			2
for many , religion still plays a part and parties are more conservative			0
@entity22 communities in the @entity135 take quinceañera just as seriously with many girls incorporating popular films into their dresses			1
for example , when @entity141 released the hit film @entity143 in 2014 , it prompted a surge of @entity147 - inspired dresses			0
at the other end of the spectrum , indigenous tribes in jungle communities in the likes of @entity226 or @entity227 would celebrate in a much simpler fashion .			0
