by @entity0 published : 18:55 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 02:09 est , 11 september 2013 in the age of @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 , the combinations of words , numbers and symbols has become even more difficult to understand for the nation ’s ‘ rents ’ the language of their beloved children may well leave them feeling a little ‘ blond ’			1
however , a new dictionary promises to help unravel the mystery surrounding the everyday conversations of the playground and internet			1
dr @entity20 , professor of linguistics at @entity22 , has provided a lexicon of words used by children aged six to 14 , together with definitions			1
for example , the professor explains that ‘ rents ’ is shorthand for parents while ‘ blond ’ is used to describe a lack of intelligence			0
the new generation of words in common usage on social networks and in the playground also includes ‘ @entity40 ’ , ‘ @entity41 ’ , ‘ @entity42 ’ , ‘ dub , and ‘ @entity44 ’			1
the professor , working in partnership with @entity47 , has also translated some great literary works , from @entity49 to @entity50 and even @entity51 to help crack the code			0
in truth , every generation of children has developed its own slang which is deliberately designed to keep their parents and teachers from knowing what is going on			2
however , in the age of @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 , the combinations of words , numbers and symbols has become even more opaque			0
dr @entity20 said : ‘ children have always been wonderful innovators that delight in creating new words			1
‘ in the 60s and 70s , ‘ hip ’ , ‘ whizzo ’ and ‘ fab ’ , in the 80s and 90s , ‘ gnarly ’ , ‘ phat ’ and ‘ the bomb ’ - and with young people increasingly communicating online , soaking up dozens of new words , slang language is evolving at lightning speed , particularly words of praise or insult			0
‘ research suggests the ability to learn new language after our teens is drastically reduced , so it can be harder for parents to be attuned to the linguistic evolution that their children are actively driving forward			0
‘ this can result in a real mismatch between what they think their children are saying and what their language actually means			0
’ a collection of 50 words most commonly used online by children aged six to 14 has been collected by @entity47 ’s @entity99 , which is the largest gaming and social interaction site for youngsters in the world			1
a new dictionary promises to help unravel the mystery surrounding the everyday conversations of the playground and internet @entity47 research found that almost seven in 10 mums and dads were unable to identify whether commonly used words are positive or negative in meaning			1
for example , in the upside down world created by children , the words ‘ @entity115 ’ and ‘ @entity116 ’ means something is good , while ‘ @entity122 ’ means ugly and ‘ owned ’ means embarrassed			1
the company ’s new ‘ digital native dictionary ’ is designed to help the two thirds of @entity125 parents who admit that they do n’t have a good grasp of the language their child uses with their peers online			0
it is being published today ( wed ) to mark the launch of a pan-european campaign called ‘ it starts with you ’ to teach kids and parents about online safety			0
@entity47 ’s @entity139 , @entity140 at @entity99 , said : ‘ our moderators have their fingers on the pulse of popular culture and one of their essential roles in keeping online interaction between children safe is to spot new or changed words that kids are using as a part of their online conversations			2
‘ as a parent , i know keeping up with my kids ’ ever - evolving vocabulary can be a challenge and i hope our new dictionary will help parents speak ‘ digital native ’			2
’ the move to help educate parents about what children are doing online is being supported by a tv and internet safety campaign fronted by @entity168 from @entity169 .			2
