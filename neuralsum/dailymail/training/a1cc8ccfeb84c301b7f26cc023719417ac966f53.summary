by @entity0 , @entity1 deputy political editor the man originally chosen as @entity4 ’s candidate in @entity5 today attacked rebel mp @entity6 for ' riding roughshod ' over him - and threatened to ' rip his throat out '			1
@entity9 said he will fight mr @entity6 to be the @entity4 candidate in the forthcoming by - election , which is expected to be held on october 9			1
the by - election was sparked by mr @entity6 's decision to defect from the @entity15 and quit @entity16 yesterday			1
mr @entity9 said he had been chosen as @entity4 's candidate just three weeks ago and would not go quietly			1
he said : ‘ i 've been fighting @entity4 ’s cause since 1997			0
i ’ve worked hard for that – now i ’m standing up for everybody who ’s going to be ridden roughshod by the establishment			0
‘ now we ’re going to take on the establishment			0
if we do n’t get the answers down here in @entity5 we ’re going to rip his throat out			0
but @entity9 ( right ) said he had already been picked as @entity4 's candidate conservative strategists hope @entity35 mayor @entity34 can stem the tide of support drifting from the @entity15 to @entity4 mr @entity9 , a 57 - year - old farmer , suggested that if he lost his battle to stand for @entity4 he would join the @entity15 instead			1
he said @entity4 's decision to support mr @entity6 as their candidate in the by - election had left a vacancy			1
he told @entity43 : ‘ @entity6 has created a vacancy for a parliamentary candidate			0
he has apparently made me unemployed as a parliamentary candidate , so if offers come in from elsewhere and there ’s a deal to be done , maybe i ’ll do a deal			0
’ as to whether he would stand for the @entity29 party – as he was once on their candidates ’ list before joining @entity4 in 1997 , he said ‘ it ’s a possible ’			2
mr @entity9 said mr @entity6 had only ‘ jumped ship ’ to @entity4 because he knew he was going to lose at the next election			1
he accused him of simply ‘ looking after himself ’			0
but mr @entity6 today defended his decision to join @entity4 and rejected accusations that he had been disloyal to the prime minister			1
he said : ' i stab people in the front , not the back '			0
mr @entity6 returned to his @entity5 constituency this morning with @entity4 leader @entity66 amid speculation eight more conservative mps considered defecting			1
he said : ‘ i like @entity69 , he 's a nice guy , he 's actually good fun			0
‘ i do n't think i 've ever stabbed anybody in the back , maybe i occasionally stab one or two people in the front but i 've been frank and straight with people			0
conservative sources in @entity77 said @entity35 mayor @entity34 could help defeat mr @entity6 by campaigning in the @entity79 seat			1
one source even suggested he could fight the by - election himself			2
one @entity29 told @entity43 : ' if @entity34 had real balls , he 'd fight @entity6 in the @entity5 by - election			1
' mr @entity6 is facing a fight to be nominated as @entity4 's candidate after the activist originally chosen to fight the next election for the party said he would not give up mr @entity6 announced yesterday that he would be standing down as @entity29 mp for @entity5 to fight the by - election as @entity4 ’s candidate			1
the decision was described by @entity4 leader @entity66 as the most honourable decision in his life time			0
but mr @entity6 ’s announcement was thrown into doubt by mr @entity97 resistance			2
it came amid claims up to eight more conservative mps have held intensive talks with @entity4 about defecting			0
after the shock defection of mr @entity6 yesterday a source told the @entity104 that the threat of a mutiny went far beyond just one mp			1
it is understood that mr @entity6 was among nine @entity15 wined and dined by millionaire @entity4 donor @entity109 at a series of discreet lunches in @entity112			1
‘ @entity109 is quietly confident that more may follow @entity6 , ’ a source said , adding that the @entity100 were happy to talk to mr @entity109 – a former @entity29 who defected to @entity4 – ‘ because they knew he understood their sense of divided loyalty ’			1
‘ @entity109 understood what they were going through because he had been on the same journey , ’ the source said			0
mr @entity69 was ambushed by the defection of mr @entity6 – a serial rebel – who quit the party with a parting blast that questioned the prime minister ’s policy on @entity129			2
the mp announced he was joining @entity4 and forcing a by - election in his @entity5 constituency in @entity79 , which will be a nightmare for the @entity15 to defend despite their 12,000 majority in 2010			1
mr @entity69 was given no prior warning of the announcement and could only watch as mr @entity66 triumphantly paraded mr @entity6 live on tv			2
the dramatic move has increased pressure on the prime minister to toughen his stance on immigration and @entity129 to stem the risk of further defections			0
@entity29 whips were scrambled to ring round @entity146 mps to shore up support			0
a senior @entity29 source insisted that mr @entity6 appeared to be a ‘ lone wolf ’ and played down the prospect of further departures			1
mr @entity6 told reporters in @entity35 that he needed the permission of his ' boss ' - the voters - before he could return to @entity16 as a member of @entity4 @entity4 is targeting a host of seats in the south and east of @entity160 in a bid to break into @entity16 at the next election @entity163 @entity5 - @entity163 @entity164 & @entity165 @entity166 - @entity163 @entity167 and @entity168 forest of @entity170 @entity171 - @entity163 @entity172 - @entity163 @entity173 - @entity163 @entity174 - @entity163 @entity176 - @entity175 @entity178 - @entity177 @entity179 - @entity177 and mr @entity69 angrily dismissed mr @entity6 ’s move as ‘ self - defeating ’			1
‘ it is obviously deeply regrettable when these things happen and people behave in this way , ’ he said			0
‘ but it is also , in my view , counter-productive			0
’ mr @entity66 claimed he had been involved in talks with a number of @entity29 @entity100 over the past six months who ‘ very strongly support everything @entity4 is trying to do ’			2
he predicted that further defections will follow if mr @entity6 triumphs in the by - election , which is likely to be held in the week after the @entity29 party conference			1
‘ the real answer to the question about how many others will join , will all depend on this by - election , ’ he said			2
‘ this by - election is going to be a @entity202 moment			0
’ mr @entity6 ’s announcement came hours after official figures showed mr @entity69 has almost no chance of keeping his pledge to cut net immigration to below 100,000 a year – last year it rose nearly 40 per cent to 243,000 , largely on the back of new arrivals from the @entity210			2
mr @entity6 , an early supporter of mr @entity69 ’s leadership bid , said the prime minister was ‘ not serious about change ’ when it came to the @entity210 and was only interested in doing the minimum needed to win an election			2
speaking at a press conference in @entity35 alongside mr @entity66 , he said : ‘ the problem is that many of those at the top of the @entity29 are simply not on our side			2
they are n’t serious about the change that @entity225 so desperately needs			0
of course they talk the talk before elections			0
they say what they feel they must say to get our support ... but on so many issues – on modernising our politics , on the recall of @entity100 , on controlling our borders , on less government , on bank reform , on cutting public debt , on an @entity210 referendum – they never actually make it happen			0
’ mr @entity6 ’s decision to trigger a by - election leaves the @entity29 facing a huge battle to prevent him becoming @entity4 ’s first elected mp			1
he has built a @entity29 majority of over 12,000 in what had been a @entity175 seat			0
@entity29 sources last night said the by - election would be held ‘ sooner rather than later ’ to prevent @entity4 gaining momentum			1
bookmakers immediately installed mr @entity6 as the odds - on favourite to hold the seat .			2

original candidate @entity9 vows to fight former @entity29 mp
he raised the *possibility* of joining the @entity15 to *challenge* mr @entity6
*development* risks *undermining* yesterday 's defection from the @entity15
mr @entity9 said : ' we do n’t bend , we do n’t break . we go out and fight '
@entity4 insist mr @entity6 is the candidate to fight expected october 9 election
by - election sparks *private* calls for @entity34 to contest the seat
but the @entity35 mayor has already put his name forward for @entity270 seat
