the knockout stages of the @entity1 begin on saturday with the possibility of the dreaded penalties now a reality for the 16 nations left in the competition			1
since it 's inception in 1982 there have been 22 penalty shootouts in the history of the @entity1 , with the most recent coming in @entity12 's 4 - 2 spot - kick win against @entity13 at the 2010 showpiece			1
with nine of the 16 teams left in @entity17 having experienced the drama of penalties before , @entity15 trawls through the history of the 12 - yard lottery			2
the three - time @entity1 champions have a perfect record of played four , won four and were involved in the very first shootout at the 1982 @entity1 against @entity40			2
history : @entity29 have never lost a penalty shootout winning the first one vs @entity40 in the 1982 @entity1 a controversial semi-final against the @entity40 , when @entity29 goalkeeper @entity46 wiped out @entity47 - resulting in the midfielder being knocked out unconscious and losing three teeth , they held their nerve to win 5 - 4 in @entity51			1
most memorably , for all the wrong reasons if you 're an @entity54 fan , @entity29 broke sir @entity57 's side hearts with a 4 - 3 penalty shooutout win following @entity54 duo @entity59 and @entity60 misses in @entity61			2
alone : @entity60 missed one of @entity54 's penalty in their @entity65 semi-final loss vs @entity29 @entity66 @entity29 - won four , lost none @entity68 - won three , lost one @entity17 - won two , lost one @entity40 - won two , lost two @entity69 - won one , lost none @entity12 - won one , lost none @entity73 - lost one , won none @entity75 - lost one , won none @entity77 - lost two , won none not forgetting ... ( @entity54 - lost three , won none ) over the years @entity68 have graced the @entity1 with the likes of @entity81 and @entity82 , but for all their flair - the country also can hold their nerve when it comes to shootout			1
the two - time winners boast the second best record from the spot , having won three and lost one			0
inspired by @entity81 , they reached the 1990 final with consecutive penalty wins against @entity95 and @entity96 before losing to the @entity97			0
in 1998 they beat @entity54 4 - 3 from the spot to reach the quarter - finals at @entity40 ' 98 in what is familiar sight for the 1966 winners			0
their most recent shootout came at the 2006 @entity1 , where they lost to the hosts @entity29 in the quarter - finals before infamously a brawl broke out among the players in the centre circle after @entity68 's elimination in @entity113			1
joyous occasion : @entity68 have won three out of four penalty shootouts including vs @entity54 in 1998 ugly scenes : @entity68 were involved in a brawl with hosts @entity29 after their 2006 elimination on penalties what about the hosts ? @entity17 are bidding to win a record sixth @entity1 and @entity123 's side boast a positive record from the spot having won two and lost one			1
the @entity129 stars most famous triumph in a penalty shootout came at the 1994 @entity1 final in @entity133 against @entity96 , when @entity96 talisman @entity134 's ballooned spot - kick gave them a third @entity1 triumph with a 3 - 2 win			2
if the @entity17 have to hold their nerve from the spot , they will be hoping their fervent support will unsettle their opponents			0
iconic moment : @entity134 missed penalty in the 1994 @entity1 final gave @entity17 victory vs @entity96 devastated : @entity134 looks crestfallen as his missed penalty gives @entity17 the 1994 @entity1 @entity147 ? for @entity77 they will be hoping three 's the magic number for them in @entity17			2
the @entity152 runners - up boast a miserable record from the spot losing both their shootout matches			0
coach @entity157 will be hoping his team wo n't emulate the sides of 1986 and 1994 if their last - 16 match against the @entity161 , who have also never won a @entity1 shootout , is decided by penalties			0
practice : @entity77 coach @entity157 ( centre ) will hope his side end their penalty shootout hoodoo @entity171 ... @entity172 yes as you 're probably well aware , @entity54 have the worst record in the history of a @entity1 shootout converting just seven of 14 of their attempts			1
played three and lost three is an undesirable record for the 1966 winners and that record wo n't improve following the @entity54 ' group stage exit in @entity17			0
as well as the disappointment of 1990 and 1998 , 2006 ended in another shootout defeat - this time to @entity184 with @entity185 the only one converting from the spot in a 3 - 1 loss for @entity189 's side			0
looking at the eight - year cycle as of which @entity54 are knocked out on penalties - it is highly feasible that if they had progressed from the group stage a similar outcome would have occurred			0
nightmare : @entity54 boast a miserable record in @entity1 penalty shootouts having lost all three rare sight : @entity185 scored @entity54 's penalty in their 3 - 1 2006 shootout to defeat to @entity184 1982 - semi-final - @entity29 beat @entity40 ( 5 - 4 ) 1986 - quarter - final - @entity29 beat @entity77 ( 4 - 1 ) 1986 - quarter - final - @entity40 beat @entity17 ( 4 - 3 ) 1986 - quarter - final - @entity69 beat @entity202 ( 5 - 4 ) 1990 - last 16 - @entity203 beat @entity204 ( 5 - 4 ) 1990 - quarter - final - @entity68 beat @entity95 ( 3 - 2 ) 1990 - semi-final - @entity68 beat @entity96 ( 4 - 3 ) 1990 - semi-final - @entity29 beat @entity54 ( 4 - 3 ) 1994 - last 16 - @entity205 beat @entity77 ( 3 - 1 ) 1994 - quarter - final - @entity206 beat @entity204 ( 5 - 4 ) 1994 - @entity207 beat @entity96 ( 3 - 2 ) 1998 - last 16 - @entity68 beat @entity54 ( 4 - 3 ) 1998 - quarter - final - @entity40 beat @entity96 ( 4 - 3 ) 1998 - semi-final - @entity17 beat @entity73 ( 4 - 2 ) 2002 - last 16 - @entity202 beat @entity203 ( 3 - 2 ) 2002 - quarter - final - @entity208 beat @entity202 ( 5 - 3 ) 2006 - last 16 - @entity209 beat @entity75 ( 3 - 0 ) 2006 - quarter - final - @entity29 beat @entity68 ( 4 - 2 ) 2006 - quarter - final - @entity184 beat @entity54 ( 3 - 1 ) 2006 - @entity210 beat @entity40 ( 5 - 3 ) 2010 - last 16 - @entity211 beat @entity212 ( 5 - 3 ) 2010 - quarter - final - @entity12 beat @entity13 ( 4 - 2 )			1
