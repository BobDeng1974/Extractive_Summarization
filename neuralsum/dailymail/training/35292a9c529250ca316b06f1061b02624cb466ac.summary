by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:29 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 06:02 est , 31 january 2014 the bitterness and rancor stirred by @entity6 's civil war were on full display this week at peace talks in @entity9 - and not just in the closed room where rival delegations are seeking a way to end the three - year conflict			1
on wednesday , the government 's chief negotiator and his team were confronted by the mother of @entity19 doctor @entity18 , who died last month while in @entity6 government custody			1
@entity21 had to be led away by @entity23 security staff as she screamed at delegates			1
@entity21 ( centre ) , the mother of @entity19 doctor @entity18 who died at 32 in a @entity6 jail in disputed circumstances , is escorted away by @entity23 security guards after trying to speak with members of the @entity6 regime delegation in @entity31 ‘ for @entity36 's sake , why did you kill my son ? , ’ @entity21 yelled as the team walked out of their hotel			1
‘ he was a humanitarian worker , he was n't a fighter			0
do n't you have a heart ? ’ the family of dr @entity18 , who was found dead in his prison cell in @entity6 , believe he was sedated with drugs before being hanged by his captors			1
they fear his body had been flushed with fluids to cover up evidence of anaesthetics in his bloodstream			1
although the results of a @entity19 post-mortem examination are not yet ready , a ct scan of dr @entity18 ’s body has apparently shown a cut in the femoral artery in one of his thighs , suggesting fluids were injected into his body			1
his family also told @entity61 the @entity6 authorities embalmed the 32 - year - old ’s body against their wishes before returning it to them			1
mrs @entity21 reacts as she is challenged by a pro @entity6 government journalist , right anger : mrs @entity21 is escorted away by friends after trying to speak with members of the @entity6 regime delegation in the media area of the @entity23 in @entity31 dr @entity18 ’s brother , dr @entity73 , 29 , said he fears the embalming was a deliberate attempt by the regime to ruin any future post-mortem examinations as the process involves flushing a dead body with fluids to preserve it			1
the peace talks have led to many other confrontations as it ’s the first time since the country devolved into its bloody civil war , that supporters and opponents of president @entity89 - many of them journalists - are meeting face to face			1
in the hallways of the @entity23 's @entity94 headquarters and on the manicured lawns outside , tempers have flared			1
scuffles have broken out as journalists interrupt rival reports and government officials have received extraordinary public grillings			1
@entity101 : mrs @entity21 is interviewed by @entity6 tv journalists at the @entity31 talks dr @entity18 was on the verge of being released when his family were told of his death by what the @entity6 government calls suicide and they say was political murder more than 130,000 people have died since the uprising against @entity89 began in march 2011 , and millions of people have been uprooted from their homes			1
the conflict has pitted neighbour against neighbour			0
people who were once friends have stopped talking to each other			0
journalists who once worked together have been separated			0
sectarian tensions , once tamped down under @entity89 's grip , have exploded into the open			2
many journalists have been forced to leave the country , either thrown out by the regime or going into self - imposed exiled in order to continue their work freely			0
many have switched jobs to work with opposition or government outlets			1
‘ it has been a rare opportunity to meet and get to know each other again , ’ said @entity133 , a @entity6 journalist working for the @entity136 - based @entity135 regional newspaper , @entity134			2
‘ it 's unnerving for both sides			2
’ family man : dr @entity18 with his son @entity142 expert : dr @entity18 in an operating theatre ( location not given ) in @entity31 , anti-government activists accuse journalists supporting the regime of coming with a specific mandate to ask disruptive questions			1
and for government officials used to controlling the narrative back home , the experience has been frazzling			2
‘ the regime 's delegation feel besieged here , they are on the defensive - clearly the weaker party , ’ claimed @entity156 , a member of the @entity158 opposition group			2
during an impromptu briefing at last week 's opening session in @entity167 , @entity6 information minister @entity164 was hounded by a widely known anti-government activist who pressed him on the government 's indiscriminate use of barrel bombs against civilians in the hard - hit northern city of @entity174			1
‘ who is using barrel bombs in @entity174 ? , ’ @entity175 asked			0
‘ i will give you the @entity180 coordinates of @entity182 headquarters in @entity183			2
why do n't you bomb them ? , ’ he demanded , referring to the @entity185 - linked @entity182 , which hopes to turn the war into a regional conflagration that would allow it to take deeper root			0
@entity175 had the tables turned on him a day later , when an @entity89 supporter at a small but boisterous pro-government rally shouted at him : ‘ you have destroyed @entity192 , @entity193			0
you will never do that to @entity6 ! ’ this was in reference to what many government supporters see as an opposition allied with the @entity200			1
pro-government journalists have capitalized on the fact that most members of the opposition 's main @entity204 - backed @entity158 are longtime exiles who have lived abroad for years , casting them as stooges of foreign powers			2
@entity209 , a member of the group 's negotiating team who lives in the @entity213 and speaks @entity135 with an @entity213 accent , was interrupted during a briefing by a journalist who demanded that he speak in @entity135			0
‘ we are @entity6 and i need the answer in @entity135			2
do you even know how to speak @entity135 ? ’ she chided			0
heartbreak : mrs @entity21 at the funeral of her son at @entity223 in @entity136 at one of his daily press conferences , @entity23 - @entity225 mediator @entity224 was peppered with so many questions from pro-government @entity6 journalists that he quipped : ‘ is there anyone in this room who is not @entity6 ? ’ on the live television position in the @entity23 garden , with a peaceful vista of @entity94 's highest mountain @entity235 in the background , both sides make outrageous accusations , clearly playing to an international audience less familiar with the war			1
opposition spokesman @entity243 claimed people in the besieged city of @entity246 were eating ‘ cats and dogs ’ because the governments restrict aid convoys			0
presidential adviser @entity251 accused extremists allied with the opposition of ‘ burning people alive in ovens			0
’ in comparison , delegation members say the negotiations inside the meeting room with @entity224 have been more civilized , though sometimes tense			0
outside , the delegations try not to cross paths , often milling about away from the podium , speaking to journalists or strolling around outside to avoid contact			0
on one occasion , @entity164 , the information minister , found himself standing back to back with an opposition delegate , as each talked to different reporters			0
@entity270 was hastily led away by an aide			0
as bitter as things may be , some are hopeful the small encounters can eventually help begin a healing process for a ravaged country			0
‘ it 's a learning process for both parties , ’ @entity133 said			0
‘ and it sends signals to the @entity6 back home			2
