by @entity0 last updated at 5:36 pm on 17th october 2011 a figure skater discovered a deadly brain tumour the size of a tennis ball after falling on the ice			1
@entity6 , 30 , from @entity7 suffered a concussion when she fell during a practice session and was rushed to hospital			1
following brain and mri scans doctors spotted the mass in her head which , although not malignant would have eventually killed her			2
dancing on ice : @entity6 , 30 , was saved after a skating accident revealed she had a brain tumour the size of a tennis ball , doctors are now ensuring it does n't grow or alter she was diagnosed with an extremely rare central neurocytoma - a type of nervous system tumor - and operated on nine days later at @entity25			1
specialists say the growth was nothing to do with her fall last july and it could have started developing at birth			2
@entity6 , who works as a finance manager and has been figure skating for three years , said : ' its unbelievable that i had such a large tumour and had no symptoms , without the fall i would n't have known about it			1
discovery : a brain scan revealed the tumour which is highlighted here in the white shaded area ' it was falling on the ice that helped this tumour get discovered and ultimately saved my life			2
' she was discharged after a majority of mass had been removed and she had received radiation therapy at @entity53			0
the therapy , also known as gamma knife surgery , is non-invasive and involves a high dose of radiation delivered to a very small area of the brain to kill the tumour , preventing damage to normal tissue , nerves and blood vessels			2
as the growth , is attached to the wall of @entity6 's brain , doctors can not remove it in fear of damaging her sight or other brain functions			1
still smiling : @entity6 says she feels lucky instead they are ensuring that the growth - which is now the size of a small strawberry - does n't grow or alter			1
@entity6 , who now has regular brain scans , added : ' my outlook has changed			1
before i used to be so focused , but now i am just grateful to be doing the thing i love			0
' i look back to the fall and i 'm so glad it happened			0
the tumour would have grown more if it was n't treated and it would 've affected my vision			0
' if it had not been detected when it was , it could have been too late and i could have died			0
' @entity6 , who finally finished her treatment in may this year , has decided to postpone her marriage to fianc√© and skating coach @entity88 , 25 , until further tests next year determine if more treatment is needed			1
she is hoping to compete in figure skating competitions and was back on the ice just five months after the accident			0
she said : ' my skating is no where near the level it was before my accident , so i have to work a lot harder , but that 's ok			0
' i used to practice four or five times a week , but now i just go twice a week for a couple of hours			0
the slow growing grade two tumour , is so rare it accounts for less than one per cent of all brain tumours			0
brain tumours can affect people of any age and around 4,500 new cases are reported in the @entity110 each year			0
symptoms depend on size but if the mass causes increased pressure on the brain they can include epilepsy or fits , severe headaches , irritability , vomiting and partial loss of vision or hearing .			1

@entity6 was n't *showing* any symptoms as a result of the brain growth
