by @entity0 and @entity1 nearly five million people will be trapped in the 40p tax band by next year , a think - tank said yesterday			1
two million of them will have been sucked in since the last election , 1.4million more than would have been affected under @entity7 ’s plans , it said			1
those caught by @entity12 ’s failure to lift the threshold in line with inflation will be £ 546 worse off next year , according to the respected @entity16			1
@entity12 's failure to lift the threshold in line with inflation will be £ 546 worse off next year , the @entity16 says but the chancellor ’s changes to @entity7 ’s plans for the 40p rate , once reserved for the wealthiest in society , mean the @entity25 has raked in an extra £ 3.6billion			1
if @entity7 ’s plans had been adhered to by mr @entity12 , people would have begun to pay the 40p tax rate if they earned £ 47,845 in 2015/16			1
but the chancellor ’s curbs on raising the threshold means the tax rate will kick in at an income of £ 42,285 – a difference of £ 5,560			1
doubts : @entity35 @entity12 was yesterday accused of fudging his figures amid warnings that @entity38 faces even deeper spending cuts after the @entity40			0
the @entity16 raised questions over how the @entity25 plans to pay for nearly £ 5billion of giveaways outlined in the @entity43			1
the respected watchdog also warned that @entity38 is not even half way through the cuts required to balance the books			0
in his @entity43 speech on wednesday , mr @entity12 boasted that unlike under previous governments his figures ‘ are not fiddled but fair and independent ’ as they are audited by the @entity50			0
but the @entity16 said it was not clear how he would pay for £ 4.9billion of giveaways such as the increase in the personal allowance to £ 10,500 and tax cuts for savers			2
‘ the chancellor is getting into bad habits , ’ said @entity16 researcher @entity35 , adding : ‘ permanent giveaways are being paid for by unspecified spending cuts and temporary increases in tax revenues			0
and he is announcing spending commitments but with no means to pay for them			0
’ in total there will be just under five million higher - rate taxpayers in 2015/16 , according to the @entity16 , up from three million in 2010 and 4.4 million today			2
that figure is 200,000 higher than recent estimates , suggesting the problem is even worse than @entity72 @entity71 had feared when they called on mr @entity12 to raise the 40p threshold in the @entity43 – demands he rejected			2
another 350,000 people earning more than £ 150,000 a year will be paying the top rate of 45p , bringing the number of people paying a tax rate of 40p or higher to 5.3 million in 2015			1
@entity79 , senior research economist at the @entity16 , said : ‘ our best estimate of how much it would cost to increase the higher - rate threshold to £ 47,845 is £ 3.6 billion a year			1
‘ this would then leave most higher - rate taxpayers £ 546.04 better off in 2015/16 than under the plans inherited from @entity7			2
’ the 2 million people who are being sucked into paying the higher rate – those earning between £ 42,285 and £ 47,845 – will be worse off as they are paying 40p income tax and 2p national insurance rather than 20p income tax and 12p @entity89 on the difference			1
someone on £ 43,285 will be £ 100 worse off , someone on £ 47,285 is £ 500 worse off			2
@entity94 , director general of the @entity95 ( @entity95 ) think - tank , said : ‘ under @entity12 , nearly 1.5 million more taxpayers are paying this rate			0
this is an attack on aspiration and entrepreneurship			0
’ when @entity106 came to power , the difference between the starting salary for 40p tax and the country ’s average full - time salary was £ 18,000			1
but research published by the @entity110 ’ @entity108 says this gap has narrowed to just £ 14,400 today , a sign of how more modest earners are being trapped			0
rather than being a tax on the wealthy , it has become a tax paid by ordinary workers from teachers to nurses , middle managers to @entity122 drivers			0
for married couples , the impact of becoming a higher - rate taxpayer is a double blow because they will also lose their married couples ’ allowance			0
from april 2015 , couples will be able to transfer £ 1,050 of their tax - free personal allowance to each other – but only if neither is a higher - rate taxpayer			2
@entity133 , a director at the accountants @entity134 , said : ‘ we are now witnessing a groundswell from many hard - working families , who do not consider themselves rich , that enough is enough			0
‘ it is important that 40 per cent tax does not become the accepted norm for such families by default			0

two million have been sucked into 40p rate since last election
millions will be £ 546 worse off next year as they are caught in tax band
@entity25 has raked in an additional £ *3.6million* *due* to the rate
