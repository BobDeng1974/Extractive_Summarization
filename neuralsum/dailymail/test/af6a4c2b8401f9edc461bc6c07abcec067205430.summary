the title race might be all but over but the fight for survival is only just beginning			2
at the end of march , @entity3 were bottom of the table with 19 points , seven off safety			1
win on saturday and they will be out of the relegation zone			1
for @entity13 and his men , their season starts now			1
when you ’re facing relegation you are supposed to be dispirited and lacking in confidence			2
so how on earth have @entity3 won three on the bounce ? only @entity20 ( 8 ) and @entity21 ( 4 ) can better that as a winning streak			1
@entity3 players are full of confidence after three successive victories in the @entity26 it has been a superhuman effort and they have fought to get themselves in a position where they have something to play for			1
@entity3 were bottom on @entity32 but win at @entity33 and they will give themselves a real chance of staying up — something only two sides have managed after being bottom at @entity32			1
it ’s not just @entity3 , though			1
the other promoted clubs — @entity41 and @entity33 — have shown fantastic spirit			2
i have been in relegation battles and seen teams with less fight in them than these three			0
@entity41 earned a fantastic win at @entity48 , were unlucky to draw at @entity49 and battled manfully against @entity21			0
@entity33 might be on a poor run but you know @entity53 ’s side will battle until the bitter end			1
so how does a manager create a positive attitude when things look so bad ? what you ca n’t afford to do is let players sit and study the fixtures and start looking at how many points they need			0
if they are too busy working out the permutations , they ’re not concentrating on their game			0
@entity3 face a crunch clash with fellow relegation battlers @entity33 on saturday if a player is not being pushed it ’s easy for them to shift responsibility and hope somebody else gets them over the line			1
the best thing to do is keep them busy			0
if you ’re working hard on the training ground looking at team shape , developing players and preparing for games , you are making much better use of your time			2
i ’ve been in that situation as a player and the worst thing you can do is to wrap them in cotton wool			0
there is a tendency to try to protect people in case things go wrong			0
training eases up because of injury fears and managers try to keep their players fresh			0
@entity3 manager @entity13 has managed to create a positive attitude in his squad but that leaves you sitting around with your thoughts and that can be dangerous			1
there needs to be mental stimulation — you ca n’t sit around and wallow in self - pity			0
at this stage of the season a week can be a long time between games			2
@entity13 and his players will be absolutely buzzing in training and it ’s important to take that energy and intensity into games			1
it annoys me when managers say it ’s all about results			0
the only way to win is to make sure that your performance is right and that comes from hard work during the week			0
@entity13 has worked hard to make sure @entity3 ’s destiny is in their own hands			1
their form has struck fear into other teams			0
@entity3 striker @entity129 celebrates scoring in the 2 - 0 victory against @entity131 the three promoted sides look brave enough to go out and play , but @entity133 and @entity134 look paralysed by fear			2
@entity136 thinks @entity134 ’s home form will keep them up but a look at the fixtures shows it wo n’t be that easy			0
@entity3 , @entity41 and @entity33 have all given their home fans reason to cheer with their efforts and the thrill of the chase means everything is applauded			1
contrast that with the toxic feeling at the @entity148			0
@entity3 have taken a long time to wake up but they have rekindled the atmosphere they had when they beat @entity151			2
and with four of their last six games at home , they need to keep that up			2
if they can , and the level of their performance continues to harness the positivity of that home crowd , do n’t bet against them making the great escape			0
fans still believe that @entity3 can still avoid the drop from the @entity26			1

@entity3 can move out of the drop zone by beating @entity33 on saturday
@entity13 *'s* side were bottom of the table on @entity32
the foxes have won last three league games on the bounce
