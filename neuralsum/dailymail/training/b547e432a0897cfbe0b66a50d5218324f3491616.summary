by @entity0 and @entity1 anger : @entity3 said the allegations against @entity6 oil companies of price - fixing are ' hugely concerning ' oil traders at @entity9 and @entity10 should face prison if it is proved they conspired to fix prices , @entity3 said last night			1
the prime minister made no attempt to disguise his anger as both of @entity6 ’s oil giants were named among several firms accused of fixing prices for more than a decade			1
he said the allegations were ‘ hugely concerning ’ and that anyone held responsible would face ‘ major consequences ’ if the claims were proved true			1
in a statement to @entity25 , @entity26 , secretary of state for energy , said firms found guilty of price - fixing would ‘ feel the full force of the law ’ and could face ‘ heavy fines ’			2
he told @entity32 : ‘ if it turns out to be the case that hard - pressed consumers have been hit in the pocket by manipulation of the markets , the full force of the law should be down upon them			2
’ experts suggested that price - fixing could have cost every @entity6 household £ 2,000 by driving up prices at petrol pumps			1
law firm @entity45 & @entity47 based its figure on data for household budgets stretching back to 2002 , when the price - fixing is alleged to have begun			2
in january 2002 , motorists paid an average of 75.3p per litre , compared to 133.35p per litre so far this month			0
' consequences ' : energy secretary @entity26 said if oil giants , including @entity9 and @entity10 , are found to have fixed prices they should feel ' the full force of the law ' accused : experts believed artificial inflation of petrol prices may have cost @entity6 households an average of £ 2,000 @entity64 , head of competition law at the firm , said it was ‘ reasonable ’ to assume that cartels push up prices by 20 per cent			1
he also predicted that oil firms found guilty of collusion to fix prices could face huge legal bills			1
‘ it would n’t be unrealistic to say that there could be hundreds of millions on the line , ’ said mr @entity64			0
speaking in @entity77 , mr @entity3 said : ‘ there is obviously the full force of the law available ... so let ’s let the investigators do their work			0
if this has been happening it is very , very serious and major consequences will follow			0
’ mr @entity3 initially said suspects could be prosecuted under a new offence brought in this year after the @entity90 interest rate scandal , which carries a maximum seven - year jail term			2
but @entity92 later issued an embarrassing clarification that the offence does not cover the oil industry and can not be imposed retrospectively			0
mr @entity3 said he would reserve judgment on the role of the @entity97 ( @entity97 ) , which has been accused of being asleep at the wheel			0
‘ the @entity97 is involved in this investigation but we have to get to the bottom of what happened first before i think we can pass judgment on the way regulators have worked in the @entity6 , ’ he said			0
but conservative mp @entity107 , a long - time campaigner against high fuel prices , lambasted the @entity97 over its inquiry this year into oil markets			1
it concluded that ‘ competition is working well ’ and said fuel price rises were due to ‘ increases in tax and the cost of crude oil ’			1
‘ what really happened was the @entity97 carried out a limp - wristed , lettuce - like inquiry when they should have done a full 18 - month inquiry into what has been going on , ’ said mr @entity107			0
he called for windfall taxes on companies proved to have been involved in price - fixing , to help pay for a cut in fuel duty .			0
