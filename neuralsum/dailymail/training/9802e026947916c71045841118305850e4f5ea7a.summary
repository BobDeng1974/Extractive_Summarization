@entity0 will announce protection for the elderly and other vulnerable people , face - to - face visits from the taxman , and an appeal process @entity0 will today announce a series of climbdowns over controversial plans to allow the taxman to seize money directly from people ’s bank accounts			1
the chancellor will agree to introduce new safeguards designed to prevent misuse of the powers , expected to be applied to around 17,000 ‘ persistent ’ non-payers a year			1
following months of controversy , mr @entity0 will announce that people will have to have a face - to - face visit from a tax official before money can be clawed back , a 30 - day grace period to arrange a repayment plan and a right to appeal to a county court			1
and vulnerable individuals , such as elderly people , will be protected , the @entity27 will say			1
in march , it was announced that the government would ‘ modernise and strengthen ’ the taxman ’s ability to call in debts by allowing ‘ direct recovery ’ of cash from bank and building society accounts , including @entity38			1
experts warned the @entity42 ’s long track record of errors meant it could not be trusted as ‘ judge , jury and executioner ’ and suggested it could prompt savers to go back to storing cash under the mattress			1
the latest concessions were welcomed by some of those who have previously attacked the plans , but are unlikely to appease all critics			0
though ministers say many other tax authorities around the world , including in @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , have similar powers , mps had described the original plans as ‘ horrifying ’			1
around 17,000 people a year will have money seized under the debt recovery powers without the need for @entity42 to go to court			1
officials expect to recoup around £ 375 million that would otherwise have gone unpaid between 2015 and 2019			0
it says it will only apply to persistent debts of over £ 1,000 , and ensure its targets always have at least £ 5,000 left over after any raid on their accounts			2
bank account raids are only supposed to be used when debtors have repeatedly ignored attempts to make contact			2
under today ’s concessions , they will also be guaranteed a face - to - face visit from an @entity42 official , to ensure that they have a chance to challenge and settle their affairs – whether by paying in full or setting up a payment plan			1
new legislation will allow @entity42 to dip into the bank accounts of ' persistent non-payer ' of tax and take what is owed , including from join accounts and @entity38 the visit will also allow officials to identify vulnerable members of society to provide them with appropriate support , ministers say			1
legislation will allow for appeal to the @entity104 , while a hold on debtors ’ accounts before money is take will now be 30 days – more than twice as long as previously planned – to allow people to make contact and arrange a payment plan or mount an objection			1
financial secretary to the treasury @entity112 will say : ‘ this is about levelling the playing field			0
the vast majority of people pay the tax that is due , on time , but there is still a very small minority who try to gain an unfair advantage by persistently refusing to pay what they owe , despite being able to			0
' these are the people who will be targeted by the powers for the direct recovery of debts owed to the exchequer			2
‘ we already set out robust safeguards to protect vulnerable debtors in our original direct recovery of debts proposals , but feedback from the consultation process told us we could do more to make sure this only catches those who are playing the system			2
‘ we ’re strengthening the guarantees we can offer taxpayers that the powers will only be used when debtors have consistently refused to talk to @entity42 and settle their debts , and their use will be subject to the toughest scrutiny and oversight possible			1
‘ we ’re far from the first country to take this step – many other tax authorities already use similar powers routinely and responsibly as a crucial lever for ensuring their government is paid what is owed			2
’ @entity155 , the chair of the tax technical committee at the @entity157 , said : ‘ the most fundamental concern we had was the lack of any independent oversight or any right to appeal to a court			0
‘ we ’ve got the independent oversight , which is what we ’ve been pushing for since day one			0
we ’ve got to see the detail in the draft legislation , but the main concern was the lack of right of appeal and we ’ve got that			0
‘ but this is now a fundamentally different power			0
now we ’ve got a right of appeal , this is a fundamentally different proposition			0
’ @entity175 , head of taxation at the @entity177 , said : ‘ this should remove some of the more authentic objections			0
‘ there was a valid objection about the sort of people who are vulnerable , elderly people for instance			2
it ’s a sensible and valid thing to do to insist on a visit to identify those sorts of cases before any direct recovery of money can take place			0
‘ this should n’t be about people who ca n’t pay , but people who can pay but simply wo n’t			0
most businesses will be in favour of a system with reasonable safeguards			0

new powers will allow @entity42 to dip into bank accounts and take money
