despite having his international future publicly questioned by @entity3 coach @entity2 , @entity0 collected his 100th cap against @entity5			1
just two months ago @entity6 said the @entity8 midfielder was not doing enough to even warrant a place in the @entity11 squad – but on friday night @entity0 was back in the heart of the @entity3 ’s midfield on a landmark occasion			1
century : @entity0 made his 100th appearance for @entity3 against @entity5 in the @entity16 influential : @entity11 playmaker @entity0 is back in favour with coach @entity2 the diminutive playmaker has had more ups and downs in his international career than most hundred - cap heroes , with a quarter final - winning brace against @entity25 and receiving the @entity26 for being voted the second best player at the 2010 finals contrasting with being stripped of the @entity11 captaincy and a late @entity16 final defeat after a lacklustre performance			1
speaking earlier this week , @entity0 said he had no intentions of ending his rollercoaster career which has also taken in spells at @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and most recently @entity8 at club level			0
‘ when i was 21 or 22 i used to think footballers of 30 were old			0
they were close to finishing their careers , ’ he said			0
‘ that happens but there is no way i 'm stopping just yet			0
you think this is my last tournament ? are you crazy ? you wo n't get rid of me over the next four years			0
’ leader : despite being dropped as captain in favour of @entity50 , @entity0 is a key figure in the squad got it , boss : @entity6 has given @entity0 another chance , despite criticising his form and fitness ‘ everything that was said about me in the past is forgotten			2
also the question of the captaincy			0
i 'm looking only forward			0
’ the @entity11 physios even spoke of their disbelief at @entity0 ’s fitness when the national side got together at the end of may – amazing when less than 12 months ago @entity6 said he was ‘ not getting the message ’ and questioned his fitness levels			1
@entity0 became the eight - youngest player to play for the @entity3 when he made his senior debut against @entity71 in 2003 , just a month after making his under - 21s international bow			1
@entity73 came slightly too soon for him , contributing just 57 minutes of play off the bench as the @entity11 made it to the semi-finals			2
but by 2006 @entity0 was ready to take centre stage for his country , although perhaps the @entity11 squad were n’t quite as ready			1
experience : @entity0 has played at three @entity82 and three @entity84 championships he started all four games but was flying home early with his team - mates after they were eliminated by @entity71 in the infamous ‘ @entity88 ’ that saw 16 yellow cards dished out			1
both 2008 ’s @entity90 and the @entity91 saw the number 10 at his best , being named in the team of the tournament for both competitions			0
@entity0 also picked up the @entity26 in @entity96 as the second - best player behind @entity98 , scoring five goals to eclipse his two in @entity101 and @entity102			2
@entity103 and @entity104 in 2012 was n’t quite as successful but after a spell out of the side @entity0 will be keen to show @entity6 and his doubters what they could have missed out on – as well as getting revenge for the final defeat four years ago .			2

@entity11 ace made 100th appearance since debut against @entity71 in 2003
he becomes just the sixth @entity11 player to reach the landmark figure
after *underperforming* in the 2010 final @entity0 plans revenge over @entity5
