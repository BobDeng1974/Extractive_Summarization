the number of mortgages being approved to home buyers is increasing as borrowers take advantage of the ultra-low rates on offer , according to a high street banking report			1
some 37,305 mortgages were approved for house purchase in february with a collective value of £ 6.2billion , marking a 2 per cent increase on the previous month , the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) said			1
while the number of house purchase approvals is still 20 per cent lower than a year ago , early 2015 is seeing a higher demand for mortgages than the levels seen towards the end of last year , the @entity8 said			1
some 37,305 mortgages were approved for house purchase in february with a collective value of £ 6.2billion meanwhile , in further signs of growing consumer confidence , the annual growth in people 's borrowing on personal loans , overdrafts and credit cards is continuing to increase at its fastest rate since 2008 , at 4.4 per cent			1
the @entity8 also said that deposit levels with high street banks saw slow growth in february , which could be partly due to the popularity of the government 's recently - launched , market - beating ' pensioner bonds '			1
@entity36 , chief economist at the @entity8 , said : ' the increase in mortgage approvals is welcome news and a sign that the housing market is beginning to improve			1
' we 're seeing stronger demand for mortgages as consumers take advantage of some of the very competitive deals currently available			2
' demand for loans and other types of personal borrowing is rising at its fastest rate since the financial crisis			0
consumers are feeling increasingly confident about buying big ticket items , such as cars or home improvements , as the recovery really begins to take hold			0
the @entity8 ( @entity61 ) have said the increase is ' welcome news ' ' personal deposits grew very slowly as alternative savings vehicles remain attractive , particularly the new pensioner bond			1
' lending to non-financial companies fell by £ 200million , with growth in manufacturing , transport , storage and communication offset by net repayments from the construction , accommodation and food services and the wholesale and retail sectors , the @entity8 said			2
@entity79 , a property economist at @entity80 , said : ' the recovery in mortgage lending reflects a very favourable economic backdrop			0
' mortgage rates are at record lows , and fewer households now expect a rise in rates within the next year			2
the reform to stamp duty has also increased most buyers ' purchasing power			0
and that boost to affordability has been accompanied by further improvements in the labour market			0
' real earnings are finally rising , unemployment is falling , and the employment rate has reached record highs			0
that should all act to boost the mortgage market			0
' @entity103 , chief @entity104 and @entity106 economist at @entity107 , said the @entity8 's mortgage figures reinforce his belief ' that the housing market is now gradually turning around after weakening during much of 2014 '			1
@entity111 , chief executive of mortgage broker @entity112 , said low mortgage rates are likely to be around for a while yet			0
he said that with @entity116 ( @entity116 ) measure of inflation at 0 per cent , a rise in the @entity119 base rate from its current 0.5 per cent level this year is ' highly unlikely and could even have been pushed back for 18 months to two years '			2
mr @entity111 said : '' the good news for borrowers is that rates are likely to be very competitive over ( the ) coming months			0
