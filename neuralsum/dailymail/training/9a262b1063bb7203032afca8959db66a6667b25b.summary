at the peak of his addiction , @entity10 , now 50 , would smoke up to 30 pipes per day and was unable to leave his home at night for fear he might not get a fix			1
' @entity17 , a @entity18 to a 19th @entity19 ' opens with this harrowing description of the @entity22 author trying to cut himself off from a drug that had taken over his life as a freelance journalist in @entity26			0
anything for a hit : in this photo taken in mid 2007 , @entity10 himself smokes opium in the living room of his apartment in @entity34 in @entity35 when he had a twenty - pipe - per - day opium habit describing the first time he tried to get help in the late 1990s , he said : ' after seven years of curious dabbling i had awoken from my pleasant dream and found myself a voracious opium fiend with a 30 - pipe - a - day habit			1
' he tells how , one @entity44 night , in a blacked - out bedroom in @entity35 's @entity34 , he went into physical and mental free fall			1
high fever oscillated with shivering cold , gut - wrenching stomach pains brought on waves of diarrhea			0
howling in agony , he leapt around the room in a kind of devil dance , his body smeared with oily sweat , vomit , mucus and feces			0
it was then that he joined @entity61 's @entity60 , where hundreds of @entity61 and foreign addicts have sought treatment through @entity65 monastic discipline and a vomit - inducing herbal drink in what he calls ' @entity61 puking rehab '			1
' @entity69 ' : a @entity71 drug addict pauses over the trough during induced vomiting to detoxify her body at the @entity76 monastery in @entity61			1
@entity10 says their screams were so loud they could be heard in the local town ' here , ' he wrote in @entity81 , ' under the auspices of monks , novices , and nuns in toga - like robes , you will find scores of recovering drug addicts from countries all over the globe , ready to take a particularly unpalatable cure involving five days of induced high - intensity vomiting			1
' he describes being told to kneel with other addicts over a trough and handed a shot glass containing a ' muddy potion ' to drink			1
the result ' brought forth torrents of rust - colored puke [ ... ] until the deluge became dry heaves			1
' ' @entity17 , a @entity18 to a 19th @entity19 ' opens with a harrowing description of the @entity22 author trying to cut himself off from a drug that had taken over his life as a freelance journalist in @entity26 this ritual was repeated every day ' while a crowd of spectators sang songs to conga - drum rhythms and cavorted about while we gagged and retched '			2
such is the nature of coming off opium in this way , he said people who lived near the monastery ' used to complain that at night they could hear the addicts ’ screams all the way into town '			1
although @entity10 does n't advocate opium use , his memoir is no simple cautionary tale , nor was he your average backpacker junkie , such as still roam this region of cheap and plentiful drugs			1
after intensive research , @entity10 says he never found a detailed , honest account by an opium addict , even during the drug 's heyday			1
' and as a result of the almost complete eradication of opium smoking in the traditional @entity138 manner , it seemed that such a book never could be written — that the subject had been lost to history , ' he said in an interview			2
' i knew that my experiences were uncommon			0
i simply wanted to share my story			0
' it 's one that in equal measure details both the bliss the drug induced — ' never again would sleep be so delicious ; never again would dreams be so real ' — and the pain of dependence and repeated attempts at withdrawal			2
five years later , now living in @entity155 , the 50 - year - old author acknowledges the drug 's continuing siren call — as do experts on addiction			1
' i think about opium every day — that 's no exaggeration , ' he says			0
' while sleeping i dream about smoking opium , and sometimes i wake up from these dreams lying on my left side , in the same exact position that an opium smoker who is right - handed like myself would lie in order to prepare and smoke his pipes			0
' old addiction : a young @entity173 smokes opium by an @entity26 man in @entity176 in this picture from 1930 dr. @entity178 , a @entity176 doctor who coordinated drug policy at the @entity180 , agrees that opium addiction is extremely difficult to shed , both physically and psychologically , the craving still there decades after the last pipe is smoked			2
big business : a @entity61 soldier displays opium poppies at a hilly area of @entity189 during an annual search and destroy opium eradication operation			2
@entity10 describes it as ' a habit that had financed empires and made fortunes all over the world ' ' we call it the syndrome of lost heaven , ' he says			0
@entity10 traces his addiction to childhood , when he exhibited a more than normal penchant for collecting things and an allure for exotic @entity26 artifacts			0
after a stint in the @entity208 he moved to the @entity209 and then @entity61 , home for 18 years			0
his introduction to opium came in 1992 in @entity212 , where the last of the old @entity138 - style opium dens still existed			1
' opium smoking , a habit that had financed empires and made fortunes all over the world , was now so rare that only in this landlocked backwater could the classic @entity138 vice be witnessed , ' he writes			2
it 's still around in @entity26 today , but mainly used by elderly hilltribe people and young westerners seeking a quick , exotic thrill while trekking in northern @entity61 or hanging out in backpacker destinations like @entity226 in @entity212			1
the so - called @entity227 , which includes areas of @entity212 , @entity229 and northern @entity61 , remains the world 's number two opium producer although @entity233 accounts for some 75 per cent of the crop			1
but almost everywhere the opium is refined into heroin , which has supplanted the ancient opiate , along with designer drugs and sometimes morphine			0
' only very particular personalities still go into this hellish opium experience these days , ' says @entity178 , who has also worked with addicts while helming several international organizations related to narcotics			0
what hooked @entity10 initially was not the drug itself but obsessive amassment of pipes , lamps and other opium - smoking paraphernalia			1
the first smoke : a @entity138 man smokes in a very upscale opium den in @entity138 in around 1920			2
@entity10 's introduction to opium came in 1992 in @entity212 , where the last of the old @entity138 - style opium dens still existed he eventually gathered one of the world 's largest collections , wrote a book on the subject and pursued scholarly research into opium 's history , culture and abiding romantic image			1
an opium pipe became for him a thing of rare beauty and ' symbol of the old @entity272 — as archaic as rickshaws , @entity138 junks and man - eating tigers			1
' closer to home , he came upon the largely forgotten fact that in the 19th and early 20th century the @entity22 was awash with opium			0
there were dens in @entity281 and popular songs like ' @entity283 in @entity284			0
' " yen " , was originally used to mean a craving for opium			0
along the way , @entity10 's occasional , recreational pipe led to a powerful addiction			2
@entity10 does n't hold back when describing the pleasures he drew from the drug			2
he experienced ' a welling euphoria followed by a serene sense of well - being washing over me like a succession of tender caresses			0
' ' opium is a charismatic lover who takes you to heaven , giving you years of warmth and affection , and then , like a schizophrenic , inexplicably and without warning begins putting you through hell ' - @entity10 , former opium addict and author of ' @entity17 ' a few pipes made him feel he could recapture childhood 's boundless optimism and wonder at the world			1
' opium is a charismatic lover who takes you to heaven , giving you years of warmth and affection , and then , like a schizophrenic , inexplicably and without warning begins putting you through hell , ' he notes			0
and @entity10 was entering the lower depths , rooted to his apartment , his work neglected , afraid to be away for even a single night lest he go without a fix			2
the death of a close companion in 2008 - possibly from sudden opium withdrawal - hit him hard			0
he had often smoked up to 30 pipes a day with @entity326 , who remains a local legend for her expertise in @entity26 ceramics and her tragic life			0
a @entity333 reporter , she lived in constant pain after losing a leg in a car accident and died in a @entity22 prison where guards failed to provide her with medical care			0
charges of alleged fraud involving smuggling of @entity61 antiques were dropped , the @entity22 government paying compensation to her family			0
with the help of his detox at @entity60 he has freed himself from opium 's grip			1
but the last line of his book is no ode to deliverance : ' when the cravings get particularly keen , i tell myself that when health is lost to disease or old age , i will find a way to once again to light the lamp , take up the pipe , and roll myself into sweet oblivion			0

@entity10 , 50 , first smoked opium in 1992 in @entity212 , where the last of the old @entity138 - style opium dens still existed
@entity10 says he never found a detailed , honest account by an opium addict , even during the drug 's heyday
he came off the drug at @entity61 's @entity60 through @entity65 monastic discipline and a vomit - inducing herbal drink
addicts were lined up daily over a trough and given ' muddy potion ' to drink before vomiting ' torrents of rust - coloured puke '
he says people who lived near the monastery ' used to complain that at night they could hear the addicts ’ screams all the way into town '
