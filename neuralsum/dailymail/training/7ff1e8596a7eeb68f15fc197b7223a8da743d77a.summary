by @entity0 this week i have been invited into the world of women ’s fashion and accessories			1
it ’s a place that most regular guys fear to tread , and most would rather undergo an afternoon of root canal dentistry than venture out on a saturday shopping trip with their lady friend			0
the reason for this is simple : women can never have enough clothes and accessories			0
@entity0 with boutique owners @entity19 ( left ) and @entity21 ( right ) @entity22 , ( far left ) @entity0 ( left ) and @entity23 ( far right ) joined @entity0 at the launch so when i was invited out to a new women ’s boutique opening in @entity28 called @entity29 i ventured along with some trepidation			1
the shop owners @entity19 and @entity21 clearly understand the female inability to resist pretty scarves , stoles , shawls , lingerie , jewellery , accessories , tops or leggings			2
the racks were laden with eye - catching items and clothing from new and up - and - coming designers and there were whoops of joy coming from the women thumbing through the merchandise on show			2
( i ’m going to pop back for something for @entity51 this sunday )			0
@entity53 's stylist , @entity54 and a friend the fashion crowd came to the @entity58 launch en mass from the four corners of @entity29			1
the @entity65 set were represented by @entity66 and @entity67 ( @entity53 ’s stylist ) wearing an uber chic @entity70 jacket , @entity62 delegates @entity63 and @entity64 were in attendance and even a few made in @entity75 types - @entity22 , @entity0 and @entity76 had made a rare journey away from @entity78 all the way to @entity80			1
they were a super-stylish bunch of women at @entity83 and i felt a little bit underdressed but i had a club @entity85 in @entity86 that night and i was n’t going to turn up to @entity88 night - club dressed in a suit			1
@entity66 ( left ) @entity63 ( centre ) and @entity91 ( right ) also made an appearance @entity93 on the @entity95 decks at @entity96 it ’s not that they ’re not a smart bunch up in @entity100 who do n’t appreciate a good bit of tailoring			1
it ’s just that four hours in a car up the @entity106 does n’t improve the cut and look of your threads			0
you tend to bowl out of your car looking like you ’ve just come out of a tumble - dryer			0
i was intending to stay just a short while in @entity86 but i was distracted by an extremely gorgeous female waitress			0
if i was a cynical kind of guy , i would suspect that the club did this deliberately as a cunning ploy			0
all the best , @entity0 .			2
