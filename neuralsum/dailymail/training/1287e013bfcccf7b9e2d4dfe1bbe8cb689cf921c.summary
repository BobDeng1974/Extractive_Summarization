pictured arriving at a tribunal hearing in @entity5 a gp has been cleared of groping a patient 's breast after a tribunal found the woman 's evidence was unreliable			1
the 42 - year - old woman claimed dr @entity2 locked the consultation room door and asked her to remove her bra while she sat on the couch			1
known only as @entity16 , she claimed that the senior partner at the @entity18 , in @entity19 , @entity20 , had knelt on the floor while he cupped and squeezed her breast as he breathed ' erratically '			1
the @entity23 accused the married father - of - two of ' sexually motivated conduct ' but the gp was vindicated when the fitness to practise found @entity16 's evidence to be unreliable			1
@entity16 , had a history of chest problems and had consulted dr @entity2 for a ' thorough ' chest examination presenting with an ongoing cough , the @entity28 was told			1
the 42 - year - old doctor had admitted to not providing a screen to protect the patient 's privacy during consultation on march 13 , 2012 , but the panel found this did not amount to misconduct			2
despite undergoing more than 60 similar appointments because of her particular medical history she told the @entity5 hearing this time it ' just felt wrong ' at the hands of dr @entity2			1
giving evidence , she said : ' it was an examination like i had never had before			0
' the position of me sitting on the couch with the doctor on his knees , and i could only see the top of his head , while holding my breast , just felt wrong , ' she added			0
' he was not squeezing continuously			0
he held my breast in a manner where he was covering my breast			0
' it felt uncomfortable to be held covering the nipple area especially			0
' the hearing was told that @entity16 reported the incident after discussing what had happened with a friend at ' the bingo ' later that day , but did not make an official complaint until two months later			2
the @entity66 - trained medic , who qualified in @entity67 in 1996 , denied any wrongdoing in his treatment of the woman throughout the hearing			2
he said the examination was justified and that it his usual practice to kneel down during a breast check if the patient is sat on the low chair in his consultation room			0
@entity16 claimed dr @entity2 locked the consulting room door at @entity18 in @entity19 , before asking her to remove her bra while he examined her chest			1
her evidence was found to be unreliable the medic argued his unusual breathing may have been to demonstrate the long , deep breaths his patient needed to take while she was being examined			0
following an application to drop the charges , the panel , chaired by @entity88 , decided that there were too many questions over the reliability of @entity16 's evidence			2
mr @entity88 told the doctor : ' the panel considered that she gave what she believed was a truthful account of what happened during your examination of her chest			0
' the panel however , can not find that she is not mistaken or has not misinterpreted innocent actions by you			0
' the panel find that there are too many question marks surrounding patient a 's overall credibility for it to put reliance on her evidence which is uncorroborated			0
' dr @entity2 had been placed under a string of temporary conditions that have now been lifted and the doctor can return to unrestricted practise .			1
