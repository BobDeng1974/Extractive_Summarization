the carnage that inevitably ensued attracted police helicopters and the dog squad to his family home in @entity20 - not to mention huge amounts of media attention			2
ironically seven years on , @entity0 now has a beautiful new home of his own but will never forget the good times as a careless and unrepentant teenager			1

the mayhem included out - of - control and intoxicated kids throwing glass and bricks , breaking letterboxes , shouting obscenities and even damaging police cars			0
mortified neighbours could n't believe what was happening on their quiet suburban street with one comparing the noise that of a football crowd , adding that people were jumping on cars			0
' just hundreds of kids , big groups , large groups coming up and down the street and they were basically throwing bottles , smashing things , picking bricks up and smacking them against the lamp - posts , ' said another to the @entity111 at the time			0
but the drama did n't end there as a few weeks later @entity0 's mother , @entity114 , was fined $ 500 for trying to prevent police for arresting her son the following month after the party			1
