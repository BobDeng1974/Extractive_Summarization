@entity0 has returned some of the most stunning true - colour images of @entity3 , showing the planet suspended in eternal beauty alongside its largest moon			1
the crystal - clear images were produced by @entity0 's @entity10 spacecraft , which has been circling @entity3 for the last eight years			1
@entity11 is one of the most @entity14 - like bodies in the solar system and , even if it is ' just ' a moon , it is bigger than the planet @entity19			0
the images also capture the changing hues of @entity3 's northern and southern hemispheres as they pass from one season to the next			1
in many respects , @entity3 's largest moon , @entity11 , is one of the most @entity14 - like worlds we have found to date			1
with its thick atmosphere and organic - rich chemistry , @entity11 resembles a frozen version of @entity14 , several billion years ago , before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere			2
the moon is enveloped by an orange haze of naturally produced photochemical smog that frustratingly obscured its surface prior to @entity10 's arrival			1
since 2004 , the spacecraft 's observations have taken the study of this unique world into a whole new dimension			2
@entity10 has revealed that @entity11 's surface is shaped by rivers and lakes of liquid ethane and methane ( the main component of natural gas ) , which forms clouds and occasionally rains from the sky as water does on @entity14			1
winds sculpt vast regions of dark , hydrocarbon - rich dunes that girdle the moon 's equator and low latitudes			2
volcanism may occur as well , but with liquid water as the lava			0
on its journey to @entity3 , @entity10 carried the @entity88 - built @entity87 probe			1
on jan. 14 , 2005 , @entity87 achieved humankind 's first landing on a body in the @entity92 when it parachuted through @entity11 's murky skies			0
@entity87 took measurements of atmospheric composition and wind speeds during its decent , along with an incredible series of images showing telltale patterns of erosion by flowing liquid			0
the probe came to rest on what appeared to be a floodplain , surrounded by rounded cobbles of water ice			0
as the @entity10 progresses , the spacecraft will monitor @entity11 's atmosphere and surface for signs of seasonal change			1
the spacecraft 's radar and camera systems will continue to peer through the haze , expanding our high resolution maps of the surface			0
and scientists will eagerly await new data that could confirm the presence of a liquid ocean beneath the giant moon 's surface			0
the exploration of this amazing place is just beginning			0
frigid and alien , yet also remarkably similar to our own planet , @entity11 is a new world â€“ revealed before our very eyes by the @entity10 and @entity87 spacecraft			2
some of these views , such as those of the polar vortex , are only possible because @entity10 's newly inclined - or tilted - orbits allow more direct viewing of the polar regions of @entity3 and its moons			1
upon @entity10 's arrival at @entity3 eight years ago , @entity3 's northern winter hemisphere was an azure blue			1
now that winter is encroaching on the planet 's southern hemisphere and summer on the north , the color scheme is reversing : blue is tinting the southern atmosphere and is fading from the north			2
other images depict the newly discovered south polar vortex in the atmosphere of @entity11 , reported recently by @entity10 scientists			2
@entity3 in all its glory : this image , taken in october 2004 , shows the full scale of the planet , including its shadow stretching across the rings @entity10 's visible - light cameras have seen a concentration of yellowish haze in the detached haze layer at the south pole of @entity11 since march 27			1
@entity10 's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer spotted the massing of clouds around the south pole as early as may 22 in infrared wavelengths			1
after a june 27 flyby of the moon , @entity10 released a dramatic image and movie showing the vortex rotating faster than the moon 's rotation period			1
the four images being released today were acquired in may , june and july of 2012			0
scientists are looking forward to seeing more of the same - new phenomena like @entity11 's south polar vortex and changes wrought by the passage of time and seasons - during the remainder of @entity10 's mission			1
@entity188 , imaging team lead based at the @entity190 in @entity191 , @entity192 , said : ' @entity10 has been in orbit now for the last eight years , and despite the fact that we ca n't know exactly what the next five years will show us , we can be certain that whatever it is will be wondrous			1
' @entity198 , deputy project scientist , based at @entity0 's @entity199 in @entity200 , @entity201 , said : ' it is so fantastic to experience , through the instruments of @entity10 , seasonal changes in the @entity3 system			1
' some of the changes we see in the data are completely unexpected , while some occur like clockwork on a seasonal timescale			0
it 's an exciting time to be at @entity3			1
' @entity3 's rings obscure part of @entity11 's colorful visage in this image from @entity0 's @entity10 spacecraft @entity3 's rings obscure part of the @entity11 's colorful visage in this image from @entity0 's @entity10			1
. if you look at the south pole , you can see a vortex - a mass of swirling gas around the pole in the atmosphere - that first appeared in @entity11 's atmosphere in 2012			0
the northern part of the moon 's atmosphere visible here includes the north polar hood , a cap of haze looking slightly darker than the rest of the atmosphere and seen near the top of the moon			2
parts of the rings appear dark near the center of this view because of the shadow cast by the planet			0
however , a sliver of illuminated @entity11 can be seen through the @entity246 in the rings near the middle of this darkness			0
this view looks toward the northern , sunlit side of the rings from just above the ring plane			0
images taken using red , green and blue spectral filters were combined to create this natural color view			0
the images were obtained with the @entity10 narrow - angle camera on may 16 , 2012 , at a distance of approximately 1.9 million miles ( 3 million kilometers ) from @entity11			2
image scale is 11 miles ( 18 kilometers ) per pixel on @entity11			0
in many respects , @entity3 's largest moon , @entity11 , is one of the most @entity14 - like worlds we have found to date			1
with its thick atmosphere and organic - rich chemistry , @entity11 resembles a frozen version of @entity14 , several billion years ago , before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere			0
the moon is enveloped by an orange haze of naturally produced photochemical smog that frustratingly obscured its surface prior to @entity10 's arrival			1
here , @entity10 spacecraft looks toward the night side of @entity11 and sees sunlight scattering through the periphery of the moon 's atmosphere and forming a ring of color			2
@entity11 's north polar hood can be seen at the top of this view , and a hint of the south polar vortex can be detected at the bottom			0
this view looks toward the @entity3 - facing side of @entity11 ( 3,200 miles , or 5,150 kilometers across )			2
@entity292 on @entity11 is up and rotated 9 degrees to the right			0
the images were acquired with the @entity10 wide - angle camera on june 6 , 2012 , at a distance of approximately 134,000 miles ( 216,000 kilometers ) from @entity11			2
image scale is 8 miles ( 13 kilometers ) per pixel			0
again , images were filtered to produce a natural colour look			0
@entity0 's @entity10 spacecraft looks toward the night side of @entity3 's largest moon and sees sunlight scattering through the periphery of @entity11 's atmosphere and forming a ring of colour @entity3 has countless moons - at least 24 , with dozens if not a couple of hundred smaller bodies in orbit			1
seven of the moons are substantial , and in this image three of them can be spotted			0

pictures show the changing colours of @entity3 's northern and southern hemispheres as they pass from one season to the next
taken by @entity10 , which has spent eight years circling @entity3
