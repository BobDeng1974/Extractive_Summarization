by @entity1 reporter published : 09:52 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 01:57 est , 4 april 2013 celebrity : stoned @entity3 may be a badly stuffed piece of taxidermy but that has n't stopped him finding fame this dazed - looking fox has a huge fan base in @entity10 , where the badly - stuffed creature became a surprise internet smash after he was spotted for sale on @entity15			1
the animal - dubbed @entity3 thanks to his bemused expression - proved such a hit his @entity18 creator has taken him all the way to @entity22 for locals to get a closer look			1
but it seems @entity10 are not universally fond of @entity3 , after local politicians in the city labelled the comical creature ' vile ' and ' russophobic '			1
a statement from the local branch of the @entity31 described @entity3 's @entity18 creator , @entity32 , as an ' unfriendly emissary from @entity34 ' and demanded that her exhibition be shut down , according to a report in the @entity37			1
their suggestion that the artist ' had allowed herself to mock a great people and its history ' comes after she was quoted as saying fans had told her they liked @entity3 because he ' looks a bit sad and drunk and that 's how @entity10 feel '			1
ms @entity32 , who is based in @entity46 , @entity47 , has said she was misquoted			2
the @entity49 artist is in @entity10 to give a series of seminars on @entity3 and the thousands of internet memes he inspired			1
ms @entity32 was inundated with pictures showing the creature pasted into a host of unlikely scenarios ; from inside the @entity58 with @entity59 , to lounging on a park bench with @entity62 actor @entity61			2
ms @entity32 had experimented with stuffing the fox , which died of natural causes , and put the finished item on @entity15			2
the @entity15 auction which sparked the craze started bidding at £ 12			0
ms @entity32 described the item as : ' a young @entity89 made to look as though it is a human			0
' i usually practice traditional taxidermy but i decided to try something a little different			0
' he is not perfect but he does have a lot of character			0
... and the fox has also found a perch on works of art lady with a @entity3 - by a modern day @entity102 ? while the fox also dons a cosmonaut outfit the astronaut outfit would n't have done @entity3 much good on an asteroid bound for @entity108 the fox even emulates @entity110 by getting to leap to @entity108 from the stratosphere ' he can sit on a cabinet , chair , shelf , or plinth			2
' the promise of ' character ' and his versatility in positioning obviously sparked something in the minds of internet users			0
a bidding war ensued after @entity125 posted the link on his @entity128 page			0
he said : ' if someone can be bothered to keep bidding on this , and win it , i will personally turn up to your house and play a live set and send you a signed copy of the album , with a picture of me and this fox totally vibin ' out			0
' a music promoter from @entity143 , @entity144 , beat other bidders to the taxidermied creature with a final bid of £ 330			0
@entity3 takes a ride on the @entity149 stoned @entity3 on the lap of @entity151 alongside @entity152 and @entity153 at the @entity155 conference in february 1945 the talking cure : @entity3 gets psychoanalysed the @entity157 , real name @entity158 , kept his word and did a set in the presence of the fox and mr @entity144 at @entity164 in @entity46 last month			0
shortly after mr @entity144 claimed his prize , ms @entity32 began to receive messages via @entity15 telling her that the stuffed animal was gaining quite a following in @entity10			1
by the end of 2012 , @entity3 was declared ' the winner of the internet ' by @entity10 's @entity173 - quite a feat in the same year that @entity175 dominated the net			1
ms @entity32 told @entity177 : ' i asked what it was about the fox that they liked and he told me that the fox looks a bit sad and drunk and that ’s how @entity10 feel			1
' his plastic eyes give him a glazed look and they identify with it , they think it symbolises the nation			0
' the fox 's stance apparently lends itself well to photoshop - meddling , left , while @entity194 , press secretary to @entity10 activist @entity195 , sported him on a t - shirt @entity3 had a sweet moment on a chocolate wrapper			2
