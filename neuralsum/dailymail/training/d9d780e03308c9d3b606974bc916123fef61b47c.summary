click here for your ultimate stats guide from the game including the move for @entity6 's opening goal scored by @entity7			1
the clamour for @entity10 's inclusion in @entity13 's @entity12 squad has been aimed mainly at @entity14 , but it would appear @entity15 has heeded it as well			1
as a native of @entity19 , the @entity6 manager could be forgiven if his international loyalties lay with @entity21 , rather than @entity13			1
but he showed a commendable regard for his adopted country 's prospects in @entity25 this summer by omitting @entity10 and @entity26 from @entity6 's final @entity28 game of the season to ensure they would be fit for international duty			1
it could yet be the under 21 tournament in @entity33 , but @entity10 , in particular , must have high hopes of a senior call - up when @entity14 names his 23 - man squad for the @entity12 at 2pm on monday			1
stones , too , could be a surprise selection , given injury concerns over @entity40 and @entity41			2

' we get so many stats and information about players ' physical condition and how they are coping , and sometimes the message is there is a risk of injury if you play them			0
' these two boys have played a lot of football recently and needed a rest			0
it was in the interests of their health , but it is also the case that , as a club , we are happy to produce as much @entity130 talent as we can			0
' that was one of the reasons we had to look after them			0
we made sure they did n't go into the summer with the risk of injury			0
' they are going to be busy , one way or the other			0
' i honestly have no idea whether it will be with the seniors or @entity143 , but , either way , we will be very proud to see @entity6 players pulling on the @entity13 jersey			1
' any manager you ask in the @entity28 will be biased and say their players should be in the national team , but i am not going to go down that route			1
' i trust @entity14 's vision , i am a big admirer of his experience , and whatever he does will be part of a plan			2
' rested : @entity26 was n't included in @entity6 's matchday squad as a precaution for the @entity12 whipped in : @entity88 ( left ) delivers a cross for @entity6 ahead of @entity68 's challenge ( right ) curled effort : @entity73 ( third right ) came close to scoring against his former club at the @entity163 hurdled : @entity47 ( right ) rides the challenge of @entity66 ( left ) during @entity6 's 2 - 0 win at the @entity163 colossal battle : @entity51 ( left ) tussels with @entity64 ( right ) for the ball during their end of season match cracking campaign : @entity15 has enjoyed a great debut season at @entity6 finishing fifth in the league @entity6 were firmly in control from the moment @entity7 fired them ahead with his first goal for the club in only the ninth minute			1
set up by @entity51 and @entity47 , the midfielder 's angled drive was too hot to handle for fit - again keeper @entity63 , who got a glove to it but could n't keep it out			2
@entity45 rarely threatened , other than a late @entity76 shot that brought the best out of @entity82 , and slipped further behind when @entity51 marked his farewell appearance in familiar style in the 46th minute			1
the on - loan @entity187 striker , who is due to return to @entity188 , latched on to a pinpoint pass from @entity90 and fired past @entity63 , after holding off @entity64 's challenge			2
on the ball : @entity87 ( right ) attempts to stop @entity192 's ( left ) run in sunday 's match @entity63 looks to have played his way into @entity198 's @entity197 final line - up , after returning ahead of schedule from a serious kidney injury , but it was one of few bright spots for the @entity45 manager			1
' we will see how he feels after today , but he has done everything he possibly could to earn a place at @entity207 , ' said @entity66			0
' the chairman is going to be disappointed with finishing 16th			0
it 's £ 1.2million prize money for each place , and we could have been a few places higher with a win , and that could have meant a new player for next season			2
' we have had an awful end to the season , and the distraction of the cup final is largely to blame			2
the performances since the semi-final just have n't been us , and that has been disappointing			0

' in any loan deal , all you want is for it to be a success , and @entity51 has been , ' he said			0
' i ’ve seen him grow as a man and player , and i think he ’s developed unique memories with @entity6			2
the fans will always have a great mental picture of @entity51 ’s talent			0
' i think the parent club will delighted with the progress he has made this season , and we ’ve benefitted from having him			0
it could n't have gone much better			0
' it is a real achievement for @entity45 to reach the final , and it is in their favour that they go there as underdogs			1
they found it difficult in the semi-final because they were favourites , but it is the opposite this time			0
if they can control their emotions and be themselves , they can really embrace what will be a fantastic opportunity to spring a surprise			0
