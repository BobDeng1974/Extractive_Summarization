@entity1 's last chance to get back into the smartphone game did not go to plan yesterday			1
first the @entity5 firm suffered the indignity of watching their share price fall by per 10 per cent within an hour of unveiling the @entity9 - powered @entity8			2
the company is battling a wave of in - difference against their hardware - and so put all their efforts into getting its ' @entity15 ' camera noticed			0
but its advert to show off the camera 's image - stabilising software was mocked on the internet today - after eagle - eyed viewers spotted a professional camera - crew in a reflection in the background			1
a talking point of the phone was the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) , which moves the camera lens around to adjust for shaky hands			2
in the video , a man rides a bicycle , with another woman riding alongside			0
comparison shots show the difference between stabilised footage and non-stabilised footage			0
everything in the video implies the man on the bike is filming the footage			0
but a background check gives the game away ... this is a camera crew in a van filming , on what appears to be a larger camera , rather than an image - stabilised @entity1 phone but as website @entity78 points out , if you freeze - frame the video at just the right second , you see the true cameraman - a man in a van			1
@entity1 were quick to apologise as the news started spreading on the internet			2
@entity87 , from @entity1 , then issued a public apology : ' in an effort to demonstrate the benefits of optical image stabilisation ( which eliminates blurry images and improves pictures shot in low light conditions ) , we produced a video that simulates what we will be able to deliver with @entity53			1
' of course , hindsight is 20/20 , but we should have posted a disclaimer stating this was a representation of @entity53 only			0
' this was not shot with a @entity8			1
at least , not yet			0
we apologise for the confusion we created			0
' @entity1 's @entity8 , which was launched today , is the phone the firm is banking on to help it take on @entity103 and @entity104 .			1

@entity1 *boasts* new @entity8 can take pictures ' better than most *digital* slrs ' ...
... but then used professional camera crew in place of @entity1 phone for adverts
@entity1 apologies : ' this was not shot with a @entity8 . at least , not yet ... '
