by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:55 est , 11 december 2013 @entity2 : 13:50 est , 11 december 2013 centuries ago a hunter - gatherer trekked across the desert in search of food and left behind just a single pair of perfectly preserved prints			1
the prints were originally found in the @entity11 of @entity12 back in 1961 but researchers from @entity14 have now managed to pinpoint when the steps would have been made			2
it is thought the prints date back some 10,550 years and may have belonged to a member of the @entity20 group of @entity21 that inhabited the region			1
the single pair of footprints , pictured , were found in the @entity25 in @entity12			2
they are thought to have belonged to a hunter - gatherer from a group called the @entity20 and predate previous finds by almost 5,000 , claims archaeologists from @entity14 by studying the stone in which the footprints were made , archaeologists from @entity14 were able to establish that the single pair of prints was made approximately 10,550 years ago , while nearby tracks date back around 7,250 years			1
the team also found pollen from trees inside the 7,200 - year - old tracks which suggests the region of the @entity41 basin was n’t always as dry and hot as it is today			0
among this was pollen from a so - called prickly pear cactus that grew during the time of the staple of the @entity20 – a group of hunter - gatherers that lived in the region			1
the @entity51 people is the collective name for a small group of @entity21 that lived in the flat , brushy areas of southern @entity55 and on the coast of the @entity57 and it is thought the prints may have belonged to a member of this group			0
the prints were originally discovered when the @entity62 was built across the @entity25			0
they were found encased in stone meaning excavators could remove them in a single piece and store them at a local museum			0
once the highway was built , the original location of the prints was lost but researchers did find 11 tracks of additional prints in the @entity41 region surrounding the road			2
by studying the stone in which the footprints were made , archaeologists from @entity14 were able to establish that the single pair of prints was made approximately 10,550 years ago , while the tracks date back around 7,250 years			2
@entity82 dr. @entity81 who led the dig said : ‘ to my knowledge the oldest human prints previously reported in @entity85 are around 6,000 years old so these prints predate them by some 5,000 years			1
’ he continued that the prints are the only reported footprints ever found in the @entity11 region			1
the prints were found in the @entity11 of the @entity25 of @entity12 , pictured , during construction of @entity93 @entity81 was able to date the tracks because they had been made in a sedimentary rock called travertine			1
researchers additionally found tracks dating back around 7,250 years , pictured , in the nearby @entity11 basin			2
in these tracks , the team found pollen from trees which suggests the region was n't always as dry and hot as it is today as water seeps through travertine , small traces of uranium remain inside the rock and because uranium decays at expected rates , @entity81 and his team could measure ‘ the ratio of those materials ’ to determine the ages			0
the team also found pollen from trees inside the 7,200 - year - old tracks which suggests the region was n’t always as dry and hot as it is today			0
among this was pollen from a so - called prickly pear cactus that grew during the time of the @entity20 - a group of hunter - gatherers that lived in the region			1
the @entity51 people is the collective name for a small group of @entity21 that lived in the flat areas of southern @entity55 and on the coast of the @entity57 , and it is thought the prints may have belonged to a member of this group			0
this also gave clues as to why the area became uninhabited in more recent years , when the area became arid and dry			0
the prints are not the oldest known footprints in the world - a track of prints were found at @entity145 in @entity146 that is thought to date back 13,000 years - but they are the oldest discovered on the continent of @entity85			1
the prints are now being stored at @entity150 ’s @entity149			0
it is thought the footprints were made by a member of the @entity51 people - a collective name for a small group of @entity21 that lived in the flat areas of southern @entity55 and on the coast of the @entity57 , marked in pink			0

the prints were found in the @entity25 in @entity12 , part of the continent of @entity85
thought to be 10,550 years old , they predate previous finds by 5,000 years
the region was home to a group of hunter - gatherers called @entity20
a set of 11 tracks were also found in the @entity11 region
