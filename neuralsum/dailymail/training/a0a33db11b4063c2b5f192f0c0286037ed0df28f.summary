a friend of @entity3 hostage @entity1 , who was confirmed dead this week , revealed she left her a message shortly after being kidnapped by militants begging her to help her escape and saying ' i 'm so sick , i 'm dying			1
' @entity1 , of @entity9 , was kidnapped by @entity3 in @entity10 in 2013 and was confirmed dead on friday			1
the @entity12 extremist group claimed she had died during a @entity14 airstrike in @entity15 and later sent her family photos of her dead body to confirm it			1
one of these photos showed the aid worker covered in a white burial shroud , intended to show she had been treated with respect			1
others showed bruising on her face , supposedly a sign of the airstrike - a fact disputed by @entity29 authorities and @entity14			1
@entity30 told @entity31 she had befriended the aid worker in @entity33 before she left for @entity34 and later received a desperate message from her after she had been captured by @entity3 militants			1
the 26 - year - old @entity29 hostage was confirmed dead last week ' she said ' please try to help me , get me out , i 'm so sick i 'm dying , ' said ms @entity30 , recalling the message			1
miss @entity1 was captured in august 2013 as she left a @entity46 hospital			1
after miss @entity1 had been taken , along with three other hostages , ms @entity30 said she tried in vain to get her contacts to convince @entity3 to release her - but with no success			1
two to three months later she received a message from her			2
ms @entity30 said the message from miss @entity1 lasted 10 - 15 seconds and she was never able to contact her herself			1
' she begged for help , ' she added			2
' i called the @entity55 , i called many people inside @entity34 asking for help asking if they could convince @entity3 to free her because she is a very good girl and did good things for @entity34			1
but @entity3 does n't care about @entity34			1
but as more months passed it began to look more impossible that miss @entity1 would be released			1
ms @entity30 said the three other people with her - all @entity34 - were eventually released purely , she suspects , because being from @entity34 meant they had ' little value ' to @entity3			1
miss @entity1 had volunteered to help people dispersed across the world and is pictured giving a presentation to a group in 2013 as part of her dedication to her humanitarian work miss @entity1 wanted to help @entity34 who had been dispersed by the civil war and worked for @entity71 to life ms @entity30 said she asked her friend not to travel to @entity34 , but she was determined to go and try and help people			1
@entity3 claimed they had treated the aid worker with respect - a fact echoed in a letter written by @entity1 while she was in captivity			1
after she died militants are believed to have sent a message to her parents , along with three photos of her dead body			1
officials told @entity87 that one photo showed her covered in the shroud , while two others showed bruising on her face			1
it has not yet been confirmed how she died			2
an intelligence assessment has also revealed she may have been offered as a bride to an @entity3 fighter			2
during her time in captivity the family also received a video featured the aid worker , forcibly filmed by @entity3 as proof she was still alive			1
miss @entity1 's parents have released a letter their daughter wrote to them while being held in captivity telling them to be strong and not worry , and that she was being well looked after ( full transcript below ) miss @entity1 had been working with humanitarian groups helping @entity34 refugees dispersed by the civil war when she left for @entity34			1
he attitude and dedication to her volunteer work is revealed in a letter received by miss @entity1 's parents , which she wrote in captivity			1
' i have been shown in darkness , light + have learned that even in prison , one can be free			2
i am grateful , ' she wrote			2
' i have come to see that there is good in every situation , sometimes we just have to look for it			0
' the aid worker , who had dedicated her life to helping people across the globe who had become dispersed , also said she had been well looked after , writing that she had even put on weight			2
she added : ' i have been treated w / the utmost respect + kindness			0
' extremist militants are understood to have sent an email to miss @entity1 's parents confirming her death			1
this contained photos of her body - one covered in a white shroud , which they claims show they had treated her with respect			1
miss @entity1 graduated from @entity140 in 2009 and since then spent her time volunteering across the world - including in @entity143 and @entity144			1

' everyone , if you are receiving this letter it means i am still detained but my cell mates ( starting from 11/2/2014 ) have been released			0
i have asked them to contact you + send you this letter			0
it 's hard to know what to say			0
please know that i am in a safe location , completely unharmed + healthy ( put on weight in fact ) ; i have been treated w / the utmost respect + kindness			0
i wanted to write you all a well thought out letter ( but i did n't know if my cellmates would be leaving in the coming days or the coming months restricting my time but primarily ) i could only but write the letter a paragraph at a time , just the thought of you all sends me into a fit of tears			0
if you could say i have ' suffered ' at all throughout this whole experience it is only in knowing how much suffering i have put you all through ; i will never ask you to forgive me as i do not deserve forgiveness			0
i remember mom always telling me that all in all in the end the only one you really have is @entity190			0
i have come to a place in experience where , in every sense of the word , i have surrendered myself to our creator b / c literally there was no else …			0
+ by @entity190 + by your prayers i have felt tenderly cradled in freefall			0
i have been shown in darkness , light + have learned that even in prison , one can be free			0
i have come to see that there is good in every situation , sometimes we just have to look for it			0
i pray each each day that if nothing else , you have felt a certain closeness + surrender to @entity190 as well + have formed a bond of love + support amongst one another … i miss you all as if it has been a decade of forced separation			2
i have had many a long hour to think , to think of all the things i will do w / @entity219 , our first family camping trip , the first meeting @ the @entity223 have had many hours to think how only in your absence have i finally @ 25 years old come to realize your place in my life			2
the gift that is each one of you + the person i could + could not be if you were not a part of my life , my family , my support			2
i do not want the negotiations for my release to be your duty , if there is any other option take it , even if it takes more time			0
this should never have become your burden			0
i have asked these women to support you ; please seek their advice			0
if you have not done so already , [ @entity245 ] can contact [ @entity245 ] who may have a certain level of experience with these people			0
none of us could have known it would be this long but know i am also fighting from my side in the ways i am able + i have a lot of fight left inside of me			0
i am not breaking down + i will not give in no matter how long it takes			0
i wrote a song some months ago that says , ' the part of me that pains the most also gets me out of bed , w / out your hope there would be nothing left … ' aka - ¬ the thought of your pain is the source of my own , simultaneously the hope of our reunion is the source of my strength			2
please be patient , give your pain to @entity190			0
i know you would want me to remain strong			0
that is exactly what i am doing			0
do not fear for me , continue to pray as will i + by @entity190 's will we will be together soon			0
