by @entity0 for @entity1 you may think any superyacht would be large and luxurious enough for the most discerning of people			0
but now the world ’s most luxurious vessel has enough room for guests and an entourage of helpers because it features its own detachable floating bungalows and even a swimming pool and garden			2
the 250ft long ( 77metre ) vessel has been designed to act as a ' mother ship ' for a series of luxury modules so that guests do n’t get under the owner ’s feet and they can have some privacy at sea			1
the 250ft long ( 77metre ) vessel has been designed to act as a ' mother ship ' for a series of luxury modules so that guests do n’t get under the owner ’s feet and they can have some privacy at sea			1
this concept shows that friends , children and the owners could all have separate floating ' bungalows ' while the vessel is anchored the brochure for the superyacht shows modules being towed along until the vessel reaches its destination			1
once anchored , the modules can be separated and used as tiny floating boltholes			2
it also has its own inflatable walk - ashore pontoon so guests can move straight from the boat onto the beach without dipping their toes in the water			0
despite its enormous size , owners could sail the carbon - fibre yacht very close to the shore because of its shallow hull design			0
a giro system would also keep living quarters level at no matter how rough the seas got , guests could continue to dine in style without the risk of seasickness			1
the design for the superyacht hints that the modules will be towed along ( pictured ) until it reaches its destination and once anchored , the modules can be separated and used as tiny floating boltholes despite its enormous size , owners could sail the carbon - fibre boat close to the shore because of its shallow hull design ( pictured ) the vessel is a concept and would cost hundred of millions of pounds to build the yacht , called the 77m x @entity76 , is still a concept but its designers say it could be made for hundreds of millions of pounds			1
the luxurious creation is the brainchild of yacht designers @entity82 from @entity83			1
its brochure reads : the ‘ 77m x @entity76 is a mother - ship with separately deployable daughter vessels each of which as unique as your imagination can conjure up			1
‘ imagine - instead of guest apartments , each daughter vessel is a different luxury object : a swimming pool , a garden , even an artificial beach complete with its own palm trees			0
a giro system ( illustrated ) would also keep living quarters level at no matter how rough the seas are , so guests could continue to dine in style without the risk of seasickness the ship is currently only a concept			1
this design shows that it could be built with berths for motorboats and a swimming pool connected to a hexagonal ' dining island ' which would create an incredible setting for dinner the @entity114 is currently a concept and would cost hundreds of millions of pounds to build			1
it would measure 250ft ( 77metres )			0
it is designed to act as a ' mother ship ' for a series of luxury modules			0
modules could include ‘ bungalows , ’ a swimming pool , garden , artificial beach , dining area and ship berths to suit an owner ’s needs			2
the carbon fibre yacht has a shallow hull design s it can anchor close to the shore			0
a giro system would also keep living quarters level at no matter how rough the seas got			1
‘ @entity137 anchor in the @entity138 and deploy your apartments anywhere you desire			0
‘ be waited on hand and foot by the crew living aboard the mother - ship or go it alone in your own isolated beach fronted apartment			1
’ ‘ combine this with the simple , inflatable , modular jetty connected directly to the beach and guests can move freely between the mother ship and their own private apartment			2
’ @entity155 , a spokesman for @entity82 , said : ‘ in this project our main goal was to assure the owner total privacy			0
‘ on a luxury 77 metre yacht there are up to 40 crew working all the time and so the owners and their guests sometimes need to escape			0
‘ usually , clients ask us to develop small , fast tenders they can use to spend a night at anchor far from the main vessel			0
‘ so we thought why do n't we provide the main vessel with one or more “ bungalows ” that can be detached and anchored as the owner desire ? ‘ these bungalows can be set as rest places , floating swimming pools , private gardens , floating platforms with real sand			2
’ the vessel 's brochure reads : the ‘ 77m x @entity76 is a mother - ship with separately deployable daughter vessels each of which as unique as your imagination can conjure up			1
' modules of a bungalow and swimming pool with an area for sunbathing can be seen being towed along by the yacht in this illustration if someone did pay the vast sum of money needed to build their bespoke yacht , complete with floating modules , they could choose their own modules and play with the configuration of them being towed along			2
these designs show how a pool , dining area and boat berths could be arranged			0

the @entity114 is a mother - ship with separately deployable modules
floating modules might include bungalows , pools and even a beach
250ft ( 77metre ) vessel is a concept and would cost millions to build
modules would be towed long behind the vessel before it anchored
design features a giro system to keep living quarters level and an inflatable walkway to connect the yacht with the beach
