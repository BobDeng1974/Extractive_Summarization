' views : in the letter the archbishop describes the ' complementary love of father and mother ' as a ' precious gift that we should wish for every child ' criticism : the archbishop said that the government could not foresee the consequences for ' children or wider society ' the remarks follow the more pointed criticism from the archbishop of westminster @entity85 , the most senior @entity15 in @entity87 and @entity88			1
he lambasted the prime minister for his ' undemocratic ' and ' orwellian ' plans to legalise gay marriage			2
