@entity0 will measure nearly 300ft in height construction had to be stopped earlier this year over safety concerns originally intended to open to the public in june but will now open in october @entity5 is close to completing construction of what will become the world ’s largest spoke free @entity0 at nearly 300ft high			1
the shi lai yun zhuan , ’ which means ‘ turn of fortune ’ @entity0 , currently under construction in the eastern @entity5 measures 89 metres ( 292ft ) in height and has a diameter of 84 metres as well as weighing in at a whopping 3000 tonnes			1
construction work on the @entity0 began in 2009 at a cost of $ 23.8million ( £ 15.5million ) but it has been dogged by delays including a six month lay off earlier this year while safety checks were carried out			1
the wheel is being built in an effort to boost tourism to the area			2
when complete it will hold 24 cars each seating 5 people , according to @entity35 ’s @entity34 tourism website			0
the website says the @entity0 will have a speed of 16.4 degrees per second , the outer ring turning 0.2 m per second , so a round trip takes about 22 minutes			1
currently , the largest @entity0 in the world is located in @entity41 , which is 165 meters tall			1
construction of the @entity0 has not been without controversy however			1
the @entity44 reported in march that construction work had only just resumed after being suspended for six months while safety checks were carried out			1
authorities were reported to be concerned following reports that exposure to the elements had left parts of the wheel prone to rust			0
spokeless wheels although striking in appearance , have several practical disadvantages that have prevented their widespread use as an alternative to conventional wheels			0
wheee they are often difficult and expensive to manufacture , requiring a great deal of precision machining , and the design leaves the bearings and other mechanical parts largely exposed to the elements			0
the drive system is especially problematic since a conventional axle and cv joint can not be used ; options include using chain or belt drive			0
another option is to house the entire propulsion system inside the wheel itself			0
work on the @entity0 only started again after it passed a safety assessment from the @entity83 , the newspaper reported			1
at the time an official with the @entity85 and @entity86 who gave his name only as @entity88 denied construction had been suspended			2
‘ workers have been making the components of the @entity0 in factories , so there are few workers at the construction site , ’ he told them @entity34 language @entity5 newspaper @entity91			1
‘ by the end of next month , the construction workers will be back to finish the rest of the work			2
’ nearly complete : the ferris wheel was due to open this month but has been delayed after a six month hiatus in construction earlier this year			1
he added the assessment and approval process for the spokeless wheel had hindered construction			2
‘ authorities approved an entertainment facility , but due to the complicated nature of this structure , authorities thought it was necessary to reassess the project , ’ @entity88 said			0
@entity88 also predicted the spokeless @entity0 would bring considerable revenue to the park and will cover the $ 23million construction cost			1
@entity5 already has a poor safety record			2
last summer a motorway bridge in @entity122 in north east @entity5 collapsed sending four huge trucks crashing 100ft to the ground below and killing three people			0
the tragedy came just ten months after the multimillion pound roadway was constructed and was one of two transport disasters to hit the province this week , with a train crash at a railway station on thursday also injuring at least 24 people			0
among the top 10 highest ferris wheels in the world , seven of them are in @entity5			0
the highest @entity0 in the world is the @entity139 at 165 metres ( 541ft ) tall			2
the largest spokeless wheel is " @entity141 " in @entity142 which is around 60 meters ( 196ft ) tall			0
the ‘ turn of fortune ’ will almost be 24 meters taller			0
as @entity5 's @entity146 is almost completing construction , @entity145 is also sketching out an ambitious plan of building a huge @entity0 on @entity149			1
@entity150 is also reportedly considering construction of its own spokeless @entity0 with a moving rail or chain design			1
in march it published designs for a 722ft tall @entity0 to be built in the capital			2
tentatively named @entity157 it will top the @entity139 and the 443ft @entity158			0
designed by @entity160 - based architecture firm @entity161 , the @entity157 will be part of a larger complex with restaurants , shopping , galleries , and theatres in the base , that 's expected to cost in the neighborhood of $ 300million .			0
