by @entity0 , business correspondent and @entity2 last updated at 10:15 am on 17th february 2012 fuel bills are set to be slashed after energy watchdog @entity5 told @entity7 's six biggest suppliers to overhaul their tariffs or face a mandatory cap			1
the watchdog said it wanted to see ' downward pressure ' on prices from the ' @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and npower after concerns customers are being ripped off			1
bills have doubled to £ 1,250 a year since 2002 , with 5.5million households facing fuel poverty , in which they spend 10 per cent or more of their income on power			1
squeezed : millions of families are struggling to afford their utility bills , with many choosing between heating and eating ( file picture ) now @entity5 have ordered energy firms to make changes to confusing and expensive tariffs or endure tougher sanctions , which could include the first price controls in ten years , according to @entity35			1
but the savings could come a little too late for families already choosing between heating and eating			2
the watchdog said : ' @entity41 has given us the task of trying to create an effective market where competition is the downward pressure on prices			2
' we think that 's the way to go , although we have n't ruled out regulation , particularly for more vulnerable customers , if our reforms do n't work			1
' this could also involve an inquiry by the @entity54 , which could break up the dominance of the @entity14 firms , who control 99 per cent of the market			2
the news comes after @entity60 provoked outrage yesterday by revealing a huge surge in profits at a time when families are struggling to pay bills			1
@entity60 said its operating profits rose by 8.5 per cent last year to almost £ 1.6billion			1
this is the equivalent of £ 427 for each of the 3.7m @entity7 households to which the @entity72 - owned company supplies gas and electricity			1
cashing in : @entity60 has announced a huge profit despite lower sales the rise came despite the ‘ @entity14 ’ firm ’s overall revenues falling by 8 per cent – as it sold less energy due to the milder winter			1
experts said the company was able to boost its profit margins because falling wholesale energy prices were not passed on in full to customers			2
consumer groups criticised the profits bonanza at @entity60 at a time when millions of families struggle to afford their energy bills			1
@entity91 , director of energy at @entity93 , said : ‘ @entity95 ’s @entity7 profits have risen despite lower energy use in the milder winter			1
‘ this will leave many customers wondering whether energy prices can , and should , be cut further			0
‘ we need successful , profitable companies			2
but consumers need to know that big profit margins are not being made needlessly at their expense			0
‘ the issue is not how much money is made over one year			0
it is whether the market is working as a whole , pricing is fair , and if suppliers are providing enough transparency			0
’ the company ’s statement yesterday said there had been ‘ lower gas volumes sold to residential customers due to particularly mild weather ’			0
as a result , its sales dropped by 8 per cent to £ 7.1billion in 2011 – but this did not stop its operating profits rising by 8.5 per cent to £ 1.58billion			1
mind the gap : the price charged by the @entity14 has risen despite a fall in wholesale gas prices @entity95 was the first of the ‘ @entity14 ’ to announce a price cut in january , reducing gas prices by 5 per cent and triggering a domino effect among competitors			0
but wholesale costs had fallen by 9 per cent			0
and the cut followed two price rises last year			0
the larger was in november when electricity prices rose by 4.5 per cent and gas by 15.4 per cent			0
@entity60 's announcement of its financial results comes days before @entity16 , owner of @entity16 , will publish its results			1
in 2010 , profits at @entity16 reached an all - time high of £ 742million and the figures for last year are expected be around £ 550m , a 25 per cent fall			1
@entity5 , blasted the ‘ @entity14 ’ as ‘ greedy ’ , ‘ bad ’ and ‘ lazy ’ in a damning report published last march			0
the industry was found guilty of manipulating prices by putting up tariffs quickly when wholesale prices rise , but delaying passing on reductions			2
yesterday consumer group which ? said there was ‘ an unstoppable tide of public opinion ’ demanding more affordable energy			0
hot story : @entity16 is also expected to announce hefty profits of around £ 550m @entity5 ’s figures showed how the industry ’s average ‘ dual fuel ’ bill for both electricity and gas was only £ 885 in 2008			1
@entity95 ’s current average was £ 1,129 , it said			2
@entity166 , executive director of which ? , said : ‘ when people see energy suppliers announcing increased profits despite a mild winter , they ’re bound to question whether they ’re paying a fair price			2
‘ millions of people are struggling with the cost of living			0
’ @entity95 said : ‘ we have a strong track record for consistently delivering some of the most competitive standard energy prices on the market – and crucially offering these during the times of year when people use the most energy			0
‘ in 2010 , one of the coldest winters in living memory , we froze our prices			0
last year , we were the last of the major suppliers to raise our prices and did so by the lowest amount			0
’ in a recent interview with this newspaper , @entity60 chief executive @entity189 said he was doing everything he could to restore ‘ trust ’ between his company and its customers			1
during a one - hour conversation , he used the word ‘ trust ’ no fewer than 61 times			0
wholesale prices peaked last autumn and fell throughout the winter , which led to energy giants finally announcing price cuts in january .			0

companies ordered to make changes now
@entity207 as @entity60 's profits rise to £ 1.6bn
@entity16 profits expected to be around £ 550m
