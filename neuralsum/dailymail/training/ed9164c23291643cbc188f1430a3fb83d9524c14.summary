by @entity0 published : 19:25 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 22:49 est , 10 march 2014 a @entity3 family is campaigning to encourage a drug company to allow their sick little boy who is fighting for his life access to life - saving medicine			2
@entity8 , a seven - year - old cancer survivor , needs a drug called @entity10 , made by small @entity12 drug company @entity11 , to fight off a viral infection he developed after a recent bone marrow transplant			1
the drug has not been approved by the @entity15 , but it has been administered to hundreds of other patients under ' compassionate use ' allowances			1
fighter : seven - year - old @entity8 has survived four bouts of kidney cancer , heart failure and a bone marrow transplant @entity11 ceo @entity24 told @entity25 that the company made the decision two years ago to stop the compassionate use program , saying they ' can not afford it ' anymore			1
' as we progressed to larger and more complex safety trials , we made the decision two years ago to stop the program and focus resources on earning @entity15 approval , ' @entity24 said			1
@entity24 says that saying yes to @entity8 would mean saying yes to many more patients , draining the company 's resources and delaying the time it will take for the drug to progress through the formal studies required before it can be given @entity15 approval and help many more future patients			1
however , the company received $ 72 million in federal funding to develop @entity10			1
@entity8 's mother , @entity47 , says the situation is devastating , especially for a boy who has fought so hard to live			2
' there ’s no good excuse for us , ' she said			0
' there ’s nothing they can say that will really keep us from asking			0
we ’re begging them to give it to us			0
' mother : @entity47 appeared on @entity61 , saying she was infuriated that she was not sitting by her son 's side and holding his hand , but had to campaign so that he could get the medicine he needs family first : @entity47 ( with her children - son @entity8 is second from left ) says she will not stop campaigning until her son has the medicine he needs courageous : @entity8 has already battled cancer four times in his seven years @entity8 was diagnosed with cancer of the kidneys in 2007			1
since then , he has battled the disease four times			0
he had been in remission for two years when a bone scan in november of 2013 revealed he had developed a bone marrow disorder due to earlier cancer treatments			1
in january of this year he had a bone marrow transplant and endured another round of chemotherapy at @entity84 's @entity83 in @entity85			1
following the successful surgery he developed adenovirus , an infection that can be deadly in people with weakened immune systems			0
' normally , @entity8 ’s immune system would be able to handle the adenovirus if his immune system was set free , ' @entity8 wrote on her son ’s @entity94 page			2
' the challenge is his immune system ca n’t be set free yet because his body is still trying to adapt to the new bone marrow cells			2
so to keep the body from killing the new cells , they have to suppress the immune system , thus creating ideal conditions for adenovirus to advance			0
' deadly virus : @entity8 is in hospital battling a virus that could claim his life , even though a drug exists that could cure it in his hands : @entity24 , ceo of @entity11 , says the company no longer has a ' compassionate use ' program @entity10 has been shown to clear up adenovirus in children in two weeks , reports @entity61			1
@entity8 's doctors have also contacted @entity11 requesting their patient be allowed to have the drug , to no avail			1
' i feel that it ’s just an excuse and we need them to totally change their stance , not only for us but for hundreds or even thousands of people that need [ this drug ] , ' @entity8 told @entity61			2
' … to me , [ it ’s ] almost a crime to not make it available to everyone who needs it			0
' @entity47 has launched a campaign to save her son , and says she will not stop until @entity8 gets the medicine , even though the fight is stealing precious moments she could be spending with her son			2
' i want to be by his bedside , holding his hand , telling him , " it ’s going to be okay , " but because of this unwillingness to release this drug , i have to leave him and come talk to you and it infuriates me , ' @entity8 told @entity61			0
curable : @entity8 is suffering from a curable virus that 's preying on him because of his compromised immune system a chance to live : the little boy has been in and out of hospital for much of his short life , never having a chance to do the things other little boys get to @entity24 said that even a visit to see @entity8 at @entity84 would not change his mind about letting the child have the medicine			1
@entity47 told @entity61 and friends what @entity24 would see if he visited @entity8 's bedside			1
' he would see a frail little boy who has a very weak voice and has a hard time staying awake because he ’s in so much pain , ' she said			0
' it ’s horrible for us as parents to see , because he ’s a vibrant , strong little boy , and even though he is frail , he has a very strong will about him			0
but things just keep stacking against him , and we just want to do everything we can to give him the opportunity to make a full recovery			0
' @entity24 told @entity61 that seeing @entity8 in this state would not change his mind			2
' we have have great compassion for this family , ' @entity24 says			0
' but this is not just about a single boy			0
' @entity47 is asking supporters to call or email @entity11 or tweet @ chimerex with the hashtag # savejosh			0
