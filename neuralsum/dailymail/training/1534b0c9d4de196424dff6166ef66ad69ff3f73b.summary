’ we welcome what the judge had to say , ’ explained @entity0			2
‘ it ’s what we have been trying to do for the last six months but it ’s been like arguing with a brick wall , so it ’s great he has ordered the two sides to get together			0
it needs resolving , because it has gone on for far too long			0

as for the latter , there has been some talk on the practice ground that @entity0 is keen on the idea of shepherding a rookie , and there was one particular debutant he was happy to throw into the mix. ‘ of all the guys in our team i guess i know @entity69 the best because we grew up playing amateur golf together , ’ said @entity0 , about the gifted but enigmatic @entity149			1
‘ i ’m not close to him but i ’ve known him a lot longer , so if @entity111 wants to throw him into the deep end with me , i ’d have no qualms about that			0
