an extremist preacher who is suspected of radicalising @entity1 lives in a leafy west @entity3 street and can not be deported because of his human rights			1
@entity6 - born @entity5 is believed to have influenced a number of young men , who then travelled abroad to join terror groups , including @entity10 , whose real name is @entity12			1
the radical cleric lives in the same neighbourbood where @entity12 , who was unmasked in february as the notorious murderer in @entity17 's ruthless propaganda videos , hung out with fellow jihadists			1
now , security services are believed to be investigating @entity21 's influence on the @entity23 terror cell of which @entity24 was a part			1
although it is not clear if the 54 - year - old made direct contact with @entity12 , he does post radical messages on websites he runs that are reportedly very influential on young wannabe jihadists			2
he has also been linked to @entity45 , another @entity6 - born jihadist and senior @entity47 operative			0
@entity45 and @entity21 were close associates in @entity3 until @entity45 was jailed for 25 years for a series of terror plots earlier this year			2

@entity55 was a close associate of @entity6 jihadist @entity45 , whose son @entity51 ( pictured ) is believed to be part of @entity1 's network in @entity17 but as officials were unable to obtain the necessary assurances to guarantee @entity21 ’s safety , human rights laws mean suspects can not be deported to countries where they are at risk			1
