' @entity6 initially denied knowledge of mr @entity10 's death , claiming he threw him out following a row over a car crash , but later admitted assaulting him during a fight after police found tiny blood droplets on the flat 's lounge wall			1
@entity50 reported seeing a bonfire in the rear garden following mr @entity10 's disappearance - a heat so intense it melted @entity56 guttering fascias - and forensic examination of debris from an oil drum showed it to be part of the victim 's humerus bone			1
@entity9 ( pictured ) was convicted of assisting an offender and sentenced to two and a half years police divers recovered the second case - containing the victim 's head , limbs and tools - below @entity70 , @entity7 , on may 16 and further searches of the canal bed uncovered a hacksaw			1

detective inspector @entity92 from @entity93 said : ' @entity10 was exploited in life by @entity6 and @entity9 and they afforded him no dignity in death			1
on the contrary , they treated him in the most despicable manner in order to conceal their crime			0
' @entity6 accepted @entity10 as a tenant on the agreement he used his considerable handyman skills to do up the flat			1
but he treated him like a slave , working him past midnight and then waking him early in the morning to continue working			0
' they were only allowed out with his say - so and given just one meal a day - usually pizza and chips			0
' @entity10 finally broke and complained at their treatment - we believe that , combined with a car accident where @entity6 accused him of being responsible for damaging his @entity118 , led to the fatal attack			1
' @entity6 said he hit @entity10 in the back and that he fell to the floor dead within seconds and claimed to have disposed of the body in panic			2
' @entity9 said she was on an errand to buy alcohol at the time of the killing but later admitted helping her boyfriend in the aftermath			0
the 39 - year - old 's remains were stuffed into two suitcases before @entity6 and @entity9 threw them into @entity18			2
police have now released @entity26 video footage showing them dragging the cases ( circled in red ) ' however , we were able to provide compelling evidence to the jury that this was a vicious murder and that @entity6 went to considerable lengths to try and cover his tracks			2
' mr @entity10 had been living at the @entity145 address for almost three weeks and was under the impression a good renovation job would help him land his own tenancy with the landlord			2
however , @entity6 blamed the father - of - three for a collision in mid-april that left his @entity118 with front end damage - and told him the crash ended his hopes of securing his own place and jeopardised their own tenancy arrangement			0

unemployed @entity6 - who has convictions for robbery , burglary , theft and drug supply - moved to @entity184 in a bid to evade police when news of the body find broke - but was arrested with @entity9 on may 19 and charged two days later			1
detectives later heard accounts from neighbours in @entity145 who told of ' aggressive , nasty ' arguments coming from the flat			0
when police raided the home , parts of a humerus bone were discovered inside this charred drum 3d scanning technology was able to prove a link between this hacksaw and lacerations found on mr @entity10 's bones the remains of @entity10 were found in a canal in @entity207 , @entity18 on may 12 last year one recalled @entity6 saying : ' i want this place finished - i 've got to live here , you are taking the p * * s ' to which mr @entity10 replied ' i 'm tired , i 'm hungry , i want to go home			1
