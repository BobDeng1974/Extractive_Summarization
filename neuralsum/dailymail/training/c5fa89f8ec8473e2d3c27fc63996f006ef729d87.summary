by @entity1 reporter published : 00:00 est , 22 february 2013 updated : 15:07 est , 22 february 2013 @entity3 officials say they are seeing a decline in the city 's rat population in the wake of @entity8 , despite many residents ' complaints that they are seeing an uptick in rodent infestations			1
the city 's health department , which collects reams of data about the rat population and maps infestations looking for trends , said rodent complaints actually had declined since the late october storm , which was spawned when @entity8 merged with two other weather systems			1
' the @entity23 conducted extensive inspections in flood zones after @entity8 , provided guidance to home owners and baited the area			0
but we did not see an increase in the rat population , ' the agency said in a statement			2
@entity3 's health department , which collects reams of data about the rat population , said rodent complaints actually had declined since @entity8 ' large storms can flush out rats , but they also drown many rats , and the net effect of large storms is often a decrease in the rat population , ' the agency added			1
the number of rodent - related citations issued by health inspectors has dropped as well			1
the @entity50 , which runs the city 's subway system , the nation 's largest , also dismissed tales of rats being stirred up by @entity8			1
' we noticed no unusual rat activity or rodent activity in the wake of the storm , ' agency spokesman @entity55 said			1
he also said that when water was pumped out of flooded tunnels and stations , there were n't large numbers of rat carcasses left behind			2
but tv stations and newspapers have been rife with reports about rats infesting parked cars and fleeing the @entity73 waterfront for the brownstones of @entity75 and exterminators enjoying a boom in business			0
for some city officials , the last straw came a week ago when a rodent problem forced a two - day closure of @entity83 , a @entity85 landmark often credited with starting a national cupcake craze			1
within days , a city councilwoman floated a proposal to create a $ 500,000 emergency rat mitigation program for storm - impacted neighborhoods			1
retired pest control expert @entity92 , who spent 30 years in the extermination business , said his first instinct was that @entity8 probably decimated the rodent population in some neighborhoods the idea of a mass rat migration drew ridicule from @entity101 , who leads a group of dog owners who conduct urban rat hunts			1
' what happened to the rats ? nothing ! we 're finding rats right where we 've always found them , ' he said			0
' i think this whole idea that there has been some kind of major relocation of rats is just good news media fodder			0
' he noted , as did other experts , that @entity123 rats , the species found in @entity3 , are known for being especially strong swimmers			1
' i have seen them dive over 70 feet , swim 500 yards , give me the finger and head for the hills , ' he said			0
' @entity8 is not going to affect these critters			0
' hard scientific data , though , is still largely lacking , and there is plenty of room for debate			0
retired pest control expert @entity92 , who spent 30 years in the extermination business , said his first instinct was that @entity8 probably decimated the rodent population in some neighborhoods			2
but he said he could n't rule out the possibility that displaced rats had moved into new territory			0
they can move distances , ' he said , citing radio telemetry studies showing that rats can move several miles if displaced by environmental conditions			0
also , because rats live in a world of smell , their former homes might have been rendered unfamiliar by a flood , he said , even if the buildings , parks or tunnels they had been living in suffered little permanent damage			0
while overall rat populations are down , there is evidence that there has been a rise in select @entity85 neighborhoods near where flooding occurred , including the @entity169 ' to a rat , it would n't look the same , it would n't smell the same , ' he said			1
@entity173 , the councilwoman who proposed the emergency extermination program for flood - damaged neighborhoods , said she was skeptical when she first started hearing stories about rat infestations since the storm but has come to believe the problem is real			1
' we are used to seeing rats			0
but it definitely seemed to be getting worse , ' @entity173 said			0
she noted that even though the health department 's citywide rat complaint numbers show no increase , there has been a rise in select @entity85 neighborhoods near where flooding occurred			1
those neighborhoods include the @entity169 , where mice first turned up in a basement storage area at @entity83 in the weeks after the storm , company spokeswoman @entity191 said thursday			1
the bakery was cited by city health inspectors in january , then was closed down feb. 14 after a follow - up inspection			1
it reopened two days later , with lines even longer than usual			0
@entity191 said she was sure the storm was a factor in the infestation , although she noted that there is also a large construction project taking place down the block			0
' at the building , and in the @entity169 , there has been an influx across the board , ' she said			2
' we do n't feel like it 's an isolated incident			0
clearly there is a trend			0
' @entity216 , a manager at @entity217 , an extermination business based in @entity219 , said his company 's rat calls are up 20 percent to 30 percent since the storm			2
recent media coverage of the supposed rat scamper caused by @entity8 has focused on @entity75 , a historic district perched on a hill above the @entity73			0
but the neighborhood 's rat problem is hardly new			2
nearly every year has brought a new newspaper story about rats in the neighborhood , usually linked to trash left by visitors to the @entity75 , the neighborhood 's elevated esplanade			2
the @entity235 , a civic group , did get some reports after the storm about new rat burrows being dug in gardens along the @entity75 , but city park officials took quick action , and there have not been any complaints since			1
at least one notable rat population perished for sure : 7,000 lab rats and mice at a @entity249 research facility died when the building flooded during the storm .			2

@entity3 's health department says rodent complaints since late october have declined
health inspectors ' rat - related citations have also gone down
but neighborhoods where flooding occurred , particularly the @entity169 , are seeing an uptick
officials believe some of the rats may have drowned in the flooding
