if you thought the running shoes with toes were strange , wait until you see what the man behind the wacky design has come up with now : the hoof			1
instead of each toe nestling in its own cosy compartment like the fingers of a glove , the new range of running shoes from @entity10 goes minimal , creating only one separate space for the big toe and relegating the remaining four digits to a shared compartment			1
the design is based on the @entity21 tabi , a soft shoe that is more like a sturdy sock			1
the new split - toe shoes are being launched this week at a trade fair in @entity26 , @entity27 , and will go on sale later this year a more robust version , the tabi shoe , is made of heavy material , often with rubber soles that give the wearer a tactile contact with the ground			1
the separated toe means the wearer can make more agile use of their feet			1
the shoes are often used by workmen including rickshaw - pullers and construction workers			1
the concept is n't new : @entity46 released a split - toe running shoe back in the 1990s , the @entity48			1
and even before that , back in 1951 , @entity21 runner @entity49 won the @entity51 wearing a pair of canvas split - toe tabi socks			1
however , @entity54 , an athlete himself and the former head of @entity57 , the company that gave the world the @entity57 running shoes , has now set up @entity60 to market the split - toe running shoe to the masses			1
the unloved finger running shoes from @entity57 were among the ' terrible things that should end in 2013 ' , according to a gossip website the new shoe is a fusion of human biomechanics and modern technology : the laces on the lightweight rt model will be made of thin steel fibres with a nylon coating , and will close by turning a dial on the outer side of the shoe			2
the design is an important anchor point for the foot , @entity79 told @entity84 's @entity83			2
' in a shoe with a roomy forefoot , you lack security , especially going downhill , ' he said			0
barefoot running came to the world 's attention when @entity94 runners @entity95 and @entity96 took part in races barefoot			0
the human foot is of course designed to be walked - and run - on			2
it is very efficient at absorbing the shock of landing and turning the energy of the fall into forward motion			0
the foot of a runner who usually wears shoes lands with an initial heel strike , while the foot of a barefoot runner lands with a more springy step on the middle , or on the ball of the foot			2
running in shoes also appears to increase the risk of ankle sprains and other chronic injuries			2
the running shoe itself has also been implicated in causing injuries			0
one 1991 study found that wearers of expensive running shoes with special features such as added cushioning or pronation correction , could actually be worse for you than cheaper shoes			2
but of course running shoes protect the feet from injury and the weather			2
the split between the big toe and the other digits mean that the toes can spread naturally while preventing the foot from sliding around inside the shoe			1
@entity79 promises that this is ' not another toe shoe '			0
the aim , he told @entity147 , is to ' try to work with what nature gave you '			0
the shoes will ' amplify your natural movements '			0
@entity79 is no stranger to controversy			0
his @entity155 shoes - the ones that separate the toes into cosy compartments of their own - sparked scepticism when they debuted			1
and just this week , they were included in a list of ' terrible things that must end in 2013 '			0
' these are revolting , ' said gossip website @entity165			0
the @entity57 shoes were designed to replicate the benefits of running barefoot			0
one of the first athletes to stun his opponents by running barefoot was @entity96 of @entity172 , who won the @entity174 marathon in 1960			0
@entity175 , one of the other competitors , remembers looking at his bare feet and thinking : ' oh well , that 's one we can beat			0
' the new split - toe shoes will be launched at a trade show in @entity26 , @entity27 , this week , and are then expected to go on sale later this year .			1

split - toe shoes are based on an ancient @entity21 design
the shoes will go on sale in the *summer*
