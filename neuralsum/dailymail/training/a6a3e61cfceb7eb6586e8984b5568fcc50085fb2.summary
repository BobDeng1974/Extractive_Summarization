@entity52 district court judge @entity50 said that former @entity2 aide @entity23 slept with a young campaign employee and also contacted three other witnesses in the past two weeks to consult with them about their planned testimony			2
calling into question the credibility of the key prosecution witness , @entity23 had agreed to testify against his former boss in the hope that he will avoid prosecution himself in the fallout from the trial of almost $ 1 million of misappropriated campaign funds by @entity2			1
the judge ruled that lawyers for @entity2 could mention the improper contact to jurors in opening arguments monday , but barred them from using the term ' witness tampering ' or telling the jury that @entity23 had a one - night stand with one of the other witnesses in 2007			1
the former aide is potentially the government 's most important witness as prosecutors seek to prove the then - married @entity3 candidate masterminded a scheme to use nearly $ 1 million provided by two wealthy campaign donors to help hide his pregnant mistress as he sought the @entity81 in 2008			1

@entity2 , 58 , has pleaded not guilty to six criminal counts related to alleged violations of federal campaign finance laws			0
violation of federal law : @entity23 pictured with his wife @entity89 contacted three witnesses in the @entity2 criminal trial to ask about their possible testimony said the judge in the trial today the former candidate sat silently in the courtroom monday morning as the lead federal prosecutor called him a man who would say or do anything to get elected president , including violating the law to hide his affair and keep his campaign viable			1
' it was n't just a marriage on the line , ' said prosecutor @entity107			0

former @entity52 sen. and presidential candidate @entity2 arrives at federal court			2
prosecutors and defense lawyers will begin making their case to jurors on whether the former presidential candidate violated federal campaign finance laws a defense lawyer for @entity2 told the jury that most of the money at issue in the case went not to support @entity135 , but was siphoned off by @entity23 and his wife to build a $ 1.5 million ' dream home ' near @entity139			1
former candidate @entity2 ' lawyers contend the payments were gifts from friends intent on keeping the candidate 's wife from finding out about the affair			2
tragically , @entity147 died in december 2010 after battling cancer			0
a key issue will be whether @entity2 knew about the payments made on his behalf by his national campaign finance chairman , the late @entity154 lawyer @entity153 , and campaign donor @entity152 , a now - 101 - year - old heiress and socialite			2
@entity23 , former campaign aide to former @entity52 sen. @entity2 enters the @entity157 for opening day of @entity2 ' criminal trial on april 23 , 2012 in @entity37 each had already given @entity2 ' campaign the maximum $ 2,300 individual contribution allowed by federal law			2
@entity2 denies having known about the money , which paid for private jets , luxury hotels and @entity135 's medical care			1
prosecutors will seek to prove he sought and directed the payments to cover up his affair , protect his public image as a ' family man ' and keep his presidential hopes viable			1
it is alleged as part of this , @entity23 and his wife invited the pregnant @entity135 to live in their home near @entity139 and later embarked with her on a cross-country odyssey as they sought to elude tabloid reporters trying to expose the candidate 's extramarital affair			2
former aide @entity23 later fell out with @entity2 and wrote an unflattering tell - all book , ' the politician			2
