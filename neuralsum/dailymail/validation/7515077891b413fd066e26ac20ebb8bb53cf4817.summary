at least three top @entity1 aides used email addresses hosted on the former secretary of state 's private server while she was in office , according to reports from two different news outlets			1
a conservative magazine reported wednesday that @entity11 's @entity10 chief and deputy chief of staff both had the private addresses			1
' two of @entity1 's top aides used personal email while they were employed at the @entity10 , ' @entity15 senior writer @entity14 said in a @entity20 interview , naming ' @entity21 and @entity22 , @entity1 's chief of staff			1
' ' the @entity10 has evidence of this , ' @entity14 claimed			2
she admitted tuesday during a news conference at the @entity48 that she deleted more than 30,000 emails she decided were personal in nature and unrelated to her job			0
separately from claims by @entity15 , the gossip website @entity54 reported this month that @entity21 and @entity55 , @entity11 's top communications strategist , had the private addresses			1
@entity21 married into a separate scandal when she wed former congressman @entity58 , whose sexting exploits landed him on front pages and hastened his departure from @entity63			0
@entity64 was able to confirm @entity21 's email address through @entity31 , a commercial service that compiles public records			1
' @entity68 ' was one of several of @entity21 's email addresses @entity31 collected in conjunction with other public records			1
email addresses typically land in the @entity31 database when people list them on credit applications , mortgage paperwork or other legal documents			2
@entity22 ( left ) was @entity11 's chief of staff at the @entity10 and reportedly used an off - the - books email address to trade messages with the then - secretary of state , potentially putting their work emails beyond the reach of government investigators searches for similar email addresses belonging to @entity55 and @entity22 were unsuccessful , as were searches for email addresses belonging to current and former @entity10 spokeswoman @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 , along with current @entity11 spokesman @entity95			1
@entity95 told @entity54 this month that @entity55 ' has never had ' an email address on the private @entity11 server , ' not for communicating with anyone about anything			1
' but @entity100 would n't say whether @entity55 used a separate private account to conduct government business with @entity11			1
@entity14 said tuesday that ' the question , i think becomes : were they emailing with @entity1 from their personal email addresses to her personal email address about @entity10 business , about @entity109 , including sensitive classified information ? ' ' those are questions that i think that @entity112 and the @entity113 is going to want to look at very carefully			2
' rep. @entity112 is a former @entity114 prosecutor now in charge of a congressional inquest into the deaths of three @entity45 during a 2012 terror attack on a diplomatic station in @entity109 , @entity120			0
@entity11 acknowledged tuesday that she deleted more than 30,000 ' personal ' emails but insisted she first gave everything work - related to the @entity10 for inspection her first public words about ' email-gate ' attracted a crush of reporters at the @entity48 @entity11 's @entity10 was criticized in the attack 's aftermath for interfering with @entity132 talking points which originally made it clear a specific @entity135 militant group , @entity134 , was responsible for the bloodshed , which claimed the lives of two security personnel and ambassador @entity139			1
at the time , the @entity140 and @entity11 personally maintained that a spontaneous protest over a crude anti-muslim internet video had spiraled out of control , sparking a riot			0
now congressional @entity145 want to know if all of @entity11 's work - related emails , hosted not on a secure government computer but on a server she personally kept at her @entity150 , @entity151 home , have been archived as federal law requires			1
@entity11 claimed tuesday during a contentious press conference , her first on the subject , that when she exchanged emails with staff members who did use official ' state.gov ' email addresses , the government archived the messages from the recipients ' end of the conversations			2
but if staffers were using ' clintonemail.com ' addresses for sensitive work , including messages about the @entity109 attack , the @entity10 would have no record of them and @entity112 's efforts to demand them could be meaningless			2
' this is the key point , ' @entity14 said wednesday			0
' yesterday , she said , " look , when i was doing @entity10 business i was emailing to people who on the receiving end of her emails had			0
gov email addresses and therefore the emails , the documents would have been retained " , ' @entity14 recounted			0
' what this suggests is that others were using non-			0
gov emails , their personal emails , and if they communicated with her in that manner those emails with her will be lost unless they 're compelled to provide them			0
' it 's unclear if the messages still exist , however			0
@entity11 conceded tuesday that she had deleted more than half of her own emails , but did not say if staffers and advisers who shared her server did the same			2
longtime press aide @entity201 ( left ) insists that he did not have a private @entity11 - linked email address , but @entity54 reported otherwise @entity112 seemed to agree with @entity14 , saying tuesday on @entity203 that emails sent to a '			1
gov ' address ' would be captured by the			0
' ' but if you 're talking to people private - to - private that will never be captured			0
' he said his committee would ' seek any private email that relates to official business , and i do n't care about wedding cakes , but any work that could have been done on private - to - private accounts for those @entity10 employees we know had private accounts			2
' earlier in the morning on @entity223 , @entity112 demanded that @entity11 allow an outside arbiter to examine the email server to determine what deleted information might be salvaged and who was using it			1
' i think it 's eminently reasonable to ask someone to turn the server over to an independent , neutral third - party , ' he said , ' not to the @entity233			0
' ' turn it over to a retired judge , an archivist , an inspector general , so that we can have some assurance , ' he said .			0

@entity15 says @entity10 has evidence @entity21 and @entity22 , @entity11 's top two aides at @entity10 , used ' clintonemail.com ' addresses
@entity54 claims @entity21 had one along with @entity55 , @entity11 's top communications strategist while she was in @entity243
public records on @entity31 show @entity21 used her clintonemail.com address but the other two have n't been confirmed
@entity11 is still *embroiled* in *controversy* over admissions that she exclusively used a private , *non-government* email server while in office
