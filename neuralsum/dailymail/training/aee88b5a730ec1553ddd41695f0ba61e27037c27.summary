by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:05 est , 24 november 2013 updated : 19:06 est , 24 november 2013 @entity3 's teenage son @entity2 was apparently signed up to vote in @entity4 , where she was standing for election , while he was actually living with his father in @entity7 the unite union is today facing an explosive new vote - rigging scandal after the son of a woman it fiercely backed to become an mp was apparently signed up to vote for her			1
the teenage son of @entity3 , a close friend of unite general secretary @entity16 , was said to be living in @entity4 , where she was fighting a battle for @entity8 to seize control of a @entity21 safe seat			1
in fact , @entity22 lived in @entity7 with his father , from whom @entity25 is separated			1
he is registered on the electoral roll as living in the city , where he works and , until recently , went to school			0
in the run up to his mother ’s vote , he was enrolled as a @entity21 member using the addresses of two rental properties in @entity4 , which would have enabled him to vote for her			1
however , the owners of the properties have no record of him ever living there			0
at the time , miss @entity3 , 49 , and her allies at @entity8 recruited new members who they apparently could count on to vote for her to be @entity21 ’s prospective mp			1
in an apparent bid to manipulate the selection up to 112 membership documents were allegedly falsified , residents were signed up without their consent and signatures forged			0
complaints of corruption sparked a police investigation and a @entity21 probe , which was called off in september by @entity56 , who claimed no evidence of wrongdoing had been found			0
the revelation that miss @entity3 ’s own family were among those recruited to @entity21 – the most damning evidence of electoral corruption in @entity4 to date and a clear breach of party rules – comes as the @entity21 leader faces increasing pressure to reopen investigations into the scandal , which he has repeatedly refused to do			1
mr @entity22 , who turned 18 in september , has been signed up to the @entity21 in @entity4 for over a year			1
in that time , he has been registered as living at two rental properties in the town			0
however , on the electoral roll he is listed as living in the @entity7 suburb @entity74 with his father @entity76			1
a @entity21 investigation into the alleged vote rigging was called off in september by @entity56 who claimed no evidence of wrongdoing had been found according to the @entity21 , it is an ‘ abuse of party rules ’ to recruit members who do not live at their claimed addresses and all members must sign up at properties where they are listed on the electoral roll			2
on his social networking profiles , mr @entity22 declares that he lives in @entity7 , and the owners and agents of the @entity4 rental properties have no record of his ever having lived there			1
none of them recognised a picture of mr @entity22 or had heard his name before			1
miss @entity3 ’s niece @entity97 , 21 , was also signed up at one of the addresses in @entity4 even though she , too , lives and works in @entity7 , where she is registered to vote			1
her boyfriend told the @entity101 : ‘ @entity97 did have her name down			0
[ but ] they were not living together			0
she has always lived here [ in @entity7 ]			1
@entity2 stays with his dad			0
’ the @entity101 spoke to @entity106 last week at her home in @entity7			2
she did not refute the allegations about her false address in @entity4 , but said : ‘ i ’m not going to give you any information at all			2
i do n’t want to discuss this			0
i ’m not telling you anything			0
’ the address where she and mr @entity22 were listed appears to have been carefully selected because it is just inside the parliamentary constituency but also sits within the boundaries of the neighbouring @entity119 area for the purposes of @entity122 elections			2
miss @entity3 ’s close friend and @entity8 ’s main organiser in the town @entity126 was expected to run for the @entity127 in @entity119 next year – so their supposed false address would have allowed them to vote for both @entity25 and mr @entity126			1
last night @entity131 chairman @entity130 said : ‘ these allegations are extremely serious			0
faced with this new evidence , @entity56 must re-open the inquiry into the @entity4 scandal			2
’ @entity21 said it was ‘ prepared to examine the new evidence ’ but would not be drawn on whether the inquiry would be reopened			0
a spokesman added : ‘ we have taken action to ensure no one who joined the party after @entity141 resigned can take part in the selection of a new candidate			0
@entity3 has already withdrawn as a candidate , the @entity146 scheme has been abolished and @entity56 has embarked on the biggest reform of the party in a generation			2
’ @entity8 and @entity25 declined to comment .			0

@entity3 was fighting for @entity8 to secure @entity4 seat
her son @entity22 , 18 , was signed up as a voter at two addresses
however he actually lived in @entity7 with his father , @entity76
*landlords* at two properties had never heard of him
