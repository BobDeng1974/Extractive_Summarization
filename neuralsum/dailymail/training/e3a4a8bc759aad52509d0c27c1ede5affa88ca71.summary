the former boss of the @entity2 who walked straight into a job at @entity4 has lobbied against the naming and shaming of supermarkets selling ‘ dirty chicken ’ , it has been claimed			1
the agency is set to publish figures this week showing the number of birds sold by individual stores that carry potentially lethal bacteria			1
but @entity14 allegedly met with @entity16 departments to warn them that publishing the figures would create a food scare			1
@entity19 , a common group of dangerous bacteria found on raw chicken , is the biggest cause of food poisoning in the @entity25			0
mr @entity14 lobbied ministers to keep data on ' dirty chicken ' - poultry infected with potentially deadly campylobacter - a secret , potentially breaching the terms of his contract at @entity4 it is linked to 280,000 food poisoning cases every year , as well as up to 100 deaths , and is estimated to cost the @entity25 economy £ 900million due to illness suffered by workers			1
according to a report in the @entity40 , he told a senior civil servant at the @entity42 that the move would also harm the industry , potentially breaching the terms of his new job			0
@entity14 moved directly from his role as head of the regulator to the leading supermarket , where he became technical director , in october 2012			1
but his new job , which was given the seal of approval by the prime minister , came with the caveat that he could not lobby ministers or civil servants on behalf of the company for two years			0
it is not yet clear when @entity14 allegedly lobbied figures linked to the @entity2 report , but the timing of his intervention could see him in breach of the conditions			1
an @entity2 report to be published later this week is expected to be highly critical of the major supermarkets over the number of infected birds they sell , with previous studies finding six in ten birds carrying the bacteria			1
the @entity2 is preparing to publish the data this week			1
@entity19 is the biggest cause of food poisoning in the @entity25 it is expected to highlight the inability of both supermarkets and farmers to tackle the problem and the agency is expected to warn shoppers to double bag chicken due to bacteria on packaging			0
the agency has fought for supermarkets to take the problem more seriosuly for years , including when @entity14 was at its helm , making his intervention more bizarre			2
@entity91 , shadow food and farming minister , wrote to @entity94 earlier this month demanding assurances that @entity14 did not lobby the @entity42 but has not yet had a reply			0
it is claimed that @entity14 met a senior civil servant on the @entity42 ’s public health division , raising his concerns about publishing campylobacter results			2
the agency has also been subjected to intense lobbying from the @entity104 , which represents the supermarkets , in an attempt to force them to drop plans to individually name and shame			0
several government departments have also raised their concerns to the @entity2			0
@entity4 did not comment on whether @entity14 had lobbied in breach of his employment conditions			2
in a statement the supermarket said : ‘ we work in close collaboration with our suppliers , other retailers and relevant food and health authorities to address the issue at all stages of the supply chain			0
’ it added that the company is ‘ committed to the reduction of the industry - wide issue of campylobacter in poultry ’			0
a preliminary study by the @entity2 in august found that the potentially lethal bacteria was on the outside of chicken packaging in 4 per cent of cases			2
agency officials were so concerned about campylobacter contamination of chicken that it launched a survey of the meat on sale in supermarkets with the intention of regularly publishing a ‘ name and shame ’ list .			2

@entity14 moved from head of @entity2 directly to @entity4
@entity151 meant he was *barred* from lobbying ministers for two years
it is claimed he met with officials in attempt to keep chicken data hidden
