cash migration : the money is sent to families in @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 and many other nations @entity8 is giving @entity10 immigrants £ 1million a week in handouts for children who live abroad			1
the payments include child benefit – which was stripped from more than one million @entity8 families last month			2
the bill is likely to rise still further when @entity17 and @entity18 get free access to the @entity8 jobs market on january 1			1
critics said it was ‘ absurd ’ to carry on sending money to countries such as @entity3 when families were losing out at home			1
overall , there are 24,082 child benefit awards currently being made , in respect of 40,171 children , according to a study			0
@entity10 citizens are also pocketing child tax credits on behalf of youngsters who are living overseas			0
it costs the taxpayer an astonishing £ 55million a year to fund this system , which is only replicated in four other @entity10 countries			2
the other 22 nations require the child to be resident in order to qualify			0
@entity8 payments relate to cases where migrants have moved to @entity8 , but left their children at home			1
when they arrive in the @entity8 , they register with @entity49 for the benefit			2
the money is then paid direct to them , so it can be sent home			0
the children do not have to live in the @entity8 or even have visited			1
migrants choose to claim the money from the @entity8 government – rather than in equivalent schemes at home – because the payments are much higher			2
in @entity3 , child benefit is around £ 5 a week			2
in @entity8 , it is £ 20.30 a week for the first child and £ 13.40 for every other child			2
two - thirds of the children – 25,659 – for whom child benefit is paid are based in @entity3			1
child benefit paid for children living overseas costs the taxpayer £ 36.6million per year , while child tax credit costs £ 18.6million per year			1
a town on the outskirts of @entity74 , @entity18			0
@entity18 and @entity17 are relatively poor , and families will be attracted to the @entity8 for jobs and benefits the figures emerged in a report by the campaign group @entity80 , which was based on @entity82 figures given in a parliamentary written answer			1
last night , chairman sir @entity84 said : ‘ it is absurd that child benefit is paid to children who do not even live in the @entity8			1
' at a time that @entity8 taxpayers are being asked to tighten their belts , the government is paying out over £ 1million per week to support children in other countries where costs are , in any case , often much lower			1
the report will re-ignite anger over the government 's cuts to child benefit			0
‘ the majority of @entity10 countries have the good sense to ensure that the child in question must be resident in that country in order to qualify and it is about time the @entity8 did the same			1
’ the report will re-ignite anger over the government ’s cuts to child benefit			0
ministers ruled that any family in which one person earns over £ 60,000 should lose the payment altogether , while they are cut on a sliding scale for those earning between £ 50,000 and £ 60,000			0
but families in which two earners both receive up to £ 50,000 did not lose out			0
critics said it penalised the traditional family , where one parent stays at home to raise children			0
in @entity129 , the @entity128 wanted to end the payments to migrants , but they have carried on paying the benefit while in power			0
the party ’s then @entity82 spokesman , @entity134 , said in 2009 : ‘ with @entity8 facing a debt crisis and the government ’s child poverty strategy in tatters , it beggars belief that @entity141 is continuing to send millions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money to children who do n’t even live in this country			1
’ from the end of this year , almost 30million residents from the two former @entity148 countries will be entitled to live and work freely in the @entity8			2
any migrant who moves here from either country will be entitled to claim child benefit and child tax credits			0
treasury minister @entity155 said @entity8 was obliged to pay child tax benefit and child tax credit under @entity10 regulations .			0

cash is awarded despite the children living in another country
critics blast taxpayer cash going to *dependents* in countries like @entity3
situation will worsen when @entity17 and @entity18 allowed @entity8 jobs
