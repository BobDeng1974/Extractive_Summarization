@entity0 are already making moves to bolster their defensive options by triggering a £ 24million release clause for @entity5 's @entity4 , according to reports in @entity7			2
the 29 - year - old centre - half played in the @entity10 final extra time defeat against city rivals real in @entity12 on saturday			1
@entity4 was a mainstay for @entity15 's @entity14 champions last season and is set to link - up with @entity17 at @entity18 after being offered a four - year deal			1
incoming ! @entity0 have triggered @entity4 's release clause of £ 24m at @entity5 key man : the @entity22 has been important for @entity15 during their @entity14 title last season age : 29 height : 6ft 1in position : centre - back club : @entity5 apperances last season : 45 @entity29 caps : 7 clauses are mandatory for all players in @entity7 , and with @entity0 seemingly operating with a blank chequebook this summer , the hefty fee has n't deterred them			1
@entity29 coach @entity34 did n't pick the big defender in his @entity37 squad - a decision that has come as a surprise given @entity4 's recent performances			2
@entity42 newspaper as claim that he has been in @entity43 looking at schools in the area ahead of a potential deal			1
@entity47 has identified the heart of his defence as a problem area , particularly after the departures of @entity52 and @entity53 has left the squad devoid of numbers			1
and @entity4 , despite his age , appears a safe choice after enjoying a renaissance on the continent since moving to @entity60 three years ago			0
what a picture ! new boss @entity17 has identified central defence as a problem position at @entity18 @entity64 : @entity0 have joined a host of clubs in chasing @entity68 youngster @entity67 ( right ) he did move back to @entity29 with @entity69 in 2006 after ill - fated one - season spells with @entity71 and @entity72			1
@entity0 have also continued to keep tabs on @entity68 's @entity67 , who wants to leave the club over a lack of games			0
the 19 - year - old is highly thought of in @entity78 and is the source of interest from @entity82 clubs including @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			2
he is one half of the best central defensive partnership in @entity88 and if @entity0 do manage to land him they will have some player			0
think @entity92 in the @entity94 / @entity92 partnership in @entity96 ’s first spell at @entity85			0
@entity97 is @entity5 's @entity94 – the brave leader heroically throwing himself in front of shots , sliding into tackles and heading in set - pieces - while alongside him @entity4 is the cool head ; the perfectly positioned partner who often goes unnoticed because he barely puts a foot wrong			2
you do n’t need the dramatic lunge if you are always in the right place at the right time			0
most commentators in @entity7 believe @entity4 has been the best defender in @entity14 this season and no one can quite understand why both he and his @entity5 team - mate @entity112 have been left out of the @entity29 squad – all the better for @entity0 who will get a player who has rested throughout the summer having put in the season of his career			1
six times @entity119 faced @entity4 this season and the @entity122 failed to scored , played out of the game by the 29 - year - old who was consistently voted best defender in @entity29 before @entity126 helped bring him to @entity5 from @entity127 in january 2011			1
as well as being impeccable defensively he knows how to get forward and score important goals , giving @entity5 the @entity130 last season by notching the winner at the @entity132 against @entity133			0
the fact that his outstanding displays have caught everyone ’s eye this season extends to @entity7 coach @entity139			0
the @entity37 - winning manager enquired over the defender ’s international status			0
unfortunately for @entity7 , he had already played full internationals with @entity29 and ca n’t follow @entity144 in making the switch to @entity7 .			0
