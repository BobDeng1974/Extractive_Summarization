@entity0 claimed sir @entity1 spoke to him before he was due to give evidence to a committee of mps this summer one of @entity6 ’s former legal advisers was accused yesterday of trying to discourage a @entity8 mp from naming @entity9 over child abuse allegations			1
@entity0 , the campaigning @entity11 mp , claimed sir @entity1 spoke to him before he was due to give evidence to a committee of mps this summer			1
mr @entity0 said sir @entity1 – who was solicitor general from 2010 to 2012 – said that ‘ challenging @entity9 on child abuse would not be a wise move ’			1
the mp made the claims in a @entity20 debate under parliamentary privilege , meaning he can not be sued for libel or face other legal action over what he said			1
the debate , about the progress of the government ’s overarching inquiry into the handling of child sex abuse allegations by public bodies , also heard from @entity33 mp @entity32 who repeated claims that a former cabinet minister was photographed with a naked boy in the sauna of a guesthouse at the centre of historic child sex abuse allegations			2
mr @entity0 told @entity14 : ‘ earlier this year i told the @entity41 that a dossier containing allegations about child abuse by politicians had been handed by @entity33 mp @entity46 to the then home secretary @entity9			1
' this revelation helped lead to the @entity50 / @entity49 review and to the establishment of the overarching inquiry			0
but not everyone was pleased with the idea that i might challenge @entity9			0
‘ the night before my appearance at the committee i had an encounter with the right honourable learned member for @entity60 [ @entity1 ]			2
after the 10pm vote he drew me to one side outside the chamber and warned me to think very carefully about what i was going to say the following day			0
he told me that challenging @entity9 on child abuse would not be a wise move and that i might even be responsible for his death as he was unwell			1
@entity9 ( left ) was home secretary from 1983 to 1985 , and mr @entity0 claims that at the time he was sent a dossier of allegations about paedophiles ‘ operating and networking within and around @entity71 ’			1
@entity72 , sir @entity1 ' i understand people are cautious about naming parliamentarians but i do think that people who might know about child abuse allegations should answer questions whatever their position			1
we should not shy away from that			0
’ @entity9 was home secretary from 1983 to 1985 , and mr @entity0 claims that at the time he was sent a dossier of allegations by mr @entity46 about paedophiles ‘ operating and networking within and around @entity71 ’			1
the dossier has never been recovered despite a @entity87 inquiry into historic files			0
the issue will form part of the overarching abuse inquiry which was commissioned by ministers in the summer			0
in yesterday ’s debate mr @entity32 claimed that a child protection campaigner had been told by one of the owners of the @entity97 , @entity98 , that she had photographs of ‘ establishment figures ’ at the hotel where boys in care had been ‘ brought in for sex ’			2
one picture allegedly showed a former cabinet minister in the sauna with a naked boy , mr @entity32 said			0
but the evidence , along with logbooks , names , times , dates and photographs of mrs @entity98 ’s customers simply disappeared after a 1982 police raid on the guesthouse			0
mr @entity32 added : ‘ there can no longer be any doubt at all that powerful people have done terrible things and that they have been protected by the establishment			0
’ mr @entity0 said earlier : ‘ we now know that from at least the 1970s up to the present day there have been people in positions of power who have sexually abused children			2
not only this , there have been powerful people willing to cover up this abuse and obstruct justice			0
’ sir @entity1 declined to comment when contacted by the @entity136 yesterday .			2
