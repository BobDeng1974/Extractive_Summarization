by @entity0 published : 12:51 est , 18 november 2012 updated : 13:47 est , 18 november 2012 a generous rector handed out crisp £ 10 notes at his church service in the hope that parishioners would make a fortune to help with church repairs			1
@entity8 , rector at @entity10 , near @entity11 in @entity12 , put his hand in his own pocket to help with a final push to raise £ 73,000 to help renovate the church			1
taking his cue from the parable of the talents in the @entity21 , where @entity22 tells the story of a man who entrusts money to his servants , @entity17 wants to see some creative ideas for a return on his investment			1
cash : @entity8 , rector at @entity10 , handed out £ 10 notes to his flock			1
he wants them to invest it and put the profit towards the renovation of the church in the rather harsh parable - on the man 's return he finds two of his servants had doubled the investment while the other , who rather missed the point , simply buried his money in the ground			1
@entity17 said : ' i handed out around £ 450 , it was mainly just the regular congregation , i do n't think anybody came along just to get the ten pounds			2
' i 'm still not entirely sure what people will do with the money but i 'm looking forward to hearing about all the great investments			0
' we need to raise the money for work we need to do on the church			2
already £ 375,000 has been raised and a further £ 73,000 is needed and i thought this would be a good time to try it out			0
' faith : @entity62 @entity8 hands out the £ 10 notes to his parishioners to invest in the hope that parishioners will make a fortune to help with church repairs			1
parable : the rector has taken inspiration from the biblical tale where a man entrusts money to his servants he added : ' not everyone in the church has money to give so i thought i 'd offer them some " seed capital " to invest , maybe in baking cakes for sale , buying car washing kit , material to make cards or a woolly hat to keep warm when offering a dog - walking service			1
charity : the money will be partially used to make the church a hub for the community ' i want all , from the oldest to the youngest to feel involved in this exciting project and hopefully do some good and have some fun while they are doing it			1
' people have until @entity97 to put their idea into action and return with the profits			0
' the parable does have a sting in the tail			0
the servant who did n't use the money wisely was " cast into the outer darkness "			0
' @entity22 was encouraging people to fully use the gifts they had been given for @entity109 , not to waste them , but i promise that , even if they make a loss , i wo n't be doing that to anyone			2
' the stunt is part of the final fundraising drive for a project which will see the church developed to make it more flexible for the wider community as well as church use			2
this will include installing a new floor , new heating system , kitchen and toilets , office , as well as entailing a complete redecoration and replacing the pews with chairs			0
scaffolding is due to be put up this weekend at the church and from @entity131 church services will be held in @entity132 until the work is completed - probably in around six months ' time			0
the parable can be read at @entity136 24:14 - 30 .			0
