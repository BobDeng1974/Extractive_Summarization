it was certainly a result that raised a few eyebrows			0
@entity2 , often so timid on the road against the big teams , producing a masterclass to whack a great big dent in @entity8 's title hopes			0
in the cold post-mortem of sunday 's game , after the thrill of @entity14 's penalty and @entity16 's header , it was found that the @entity17 had just 35.33 per cent of possession			1
it means they saw less of the ball on sunday than in any of their @entity22 matches since 2003 and yet still came away with a very impressive victory			0
@entity14 is mobbed by his team - mates after putting @entity2 in front from the penalty spot at @entity8 @entity16 doubled @entity2 's advantage with a header midway through the second - half @entity31 's men were able to absorb @entity8 's pressure and hit them when their chances arose but while @entity31 's team are renowned for adopting a passing game , craving the ball at all times and working it around to try and force an opportunity , they can also win without it - especially on the road			1
indeed , a study of their possession stats from every away match since 2003 shows that they won seven of the eight matches in which they had a smaller share of the ball			0
sunday 's match at the @entity51 tops the list but there are plenty of other examples			0
in november 2008 , @entity2 saw just 40.22 per cent of the ball at @entity57 , and yet still beat @entity58 2 - 1 thanks to a double from @entity61			1

@entity2 had just 36.48 per cent of the ball and in march last year , they defeated @entity102 at @entity135 thanks to @entity73 's winner having enjoyed a mere 40.38 per cent of possession			2
back in december , they earned a 2 - 2 draw at @entity78 despite only having 36.48 per cent of the ball			2
matches against their fellow top - four candidates aside , @entity2 have also shown a capability to grind out results when starved of possession at @entity106 , @entity112 and @entity121 in the last few years			2
it shows that possession of the ball is not the be-all and end - all in any match			0
curiously though , while @entity2 can grind out results with just 35 or 40 per cent possession on their travels , it 's a different story at the @entity154			1
at the @entity154 , by contrast , @entity2 struggle to grind out results when starved of possession ( @entity158 ) @entity159 celebrates a goal for @entity8 in january 2013			2
@entity2 had 39.72 per cent of the ball @entity163 ' graphic displaying @entity2 's lowest possession stats and results @entity105 celebrates with @entity109 after scoring in @entity2 's 7 - 3 win over @entity167 in december 2012			1
in a bizarre game , the @entity17 had just 44.1 per cent of possession but scored seven goals			0
most sides visiting north @entity172 find themselves under the cosh but occasionally some come and dominate			0
@entity8 , visiting in january 2013 , won 2 - 0 after restricting @entity2 to just 39.72 per cent of the ball			1
but conversely , @entity2 beat @entity102 1 - 0 in september 2013 , thanks to @entity16 's winner , after seeing a mere 43.14 per cent of possession			1
and , perhaps the most bizarre of all , @entity2 's 7 - 3 rout of @entity167 in december 2012 came after they enjoyed just 44.1 per cent of the ball .			0

@entity2 beat @entity8 2 - 0 on sunday with just 35.33 per cent possession
it was their lowest @entity22 possession count since 2003
but a penalty from @entity14 and an @entity16 goal saw them win
@entity31 's team have proved they *'re* able to grind out results before
often they have 35 - 40 per cent of the ball away from home and win
