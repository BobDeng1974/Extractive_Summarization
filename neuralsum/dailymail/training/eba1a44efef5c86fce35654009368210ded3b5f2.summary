levels of inequality have reached unprecedented heights in @entity3 , with more than a third of its wealth concentrated in the hands of just 110 super-rich people , says a new report			1
@entity11 investment bank says wealth has been massively concentrated in the hands of powerful ‘ oligarchs ’ – among them well - known football tycoons @entity17 , the owner of @entity19 , and @entity20 , a major shareholder at @entity22			1
and they nearly all owe their wealth to president @entity24 , who has allowed trusted businessmen to gain exclusive rights to the nation ’s vast natural reserves			0
@entity3 's richest men : ( clockwise from top left ) @entity20 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 in @entity44 times , the @entity42 credo was that everyone was equal – though the reality was different – but now the contrast could hardly be starker			1
@entity3 has a population of 143.5 million generating total household wealth of £ 750billion , but £ 263billion of that is owned by just 110 people			1
‘ @entity3 has the highest level of wealth inequality in the world , apart from small @entity56 nations with resident billionaires , ’ said @entity11			1
its report said the discrepancy was a ‘ parody ’ of the hopes for a prosperous egalitarian society that some held for @entity3 following the @entity44 ’s collapse			1
and the gulf is expected to grow			0
@entity3 currently has 84,000 dollar millionaires , a figure forecast to rise to 133,000 by 2018 – a faster rate than @entity68 or @entity69			2
most of the ‘ @entity72 - to - @entity73 ’ dollar billionaires made their fortunes by buying up highly prized state assets of the old @entity44 , or through securing lucrative contracts awarded by the @entity77 for which the closest political connections are deemed necessary			1
@entity3 's richest man , @entity20 , controls @entity80 , a @entity81 - based entity with holdings in mining , technology and telecommunications			1
he also co-owns @entity22 after a decade of chaos under @entity87 in the @entity88 , mr @entity24 set about tapping @entity3 ’s vast natural wealth in order to rebuild a country battered by the transition from @entity93 to rampant capitalism			1
with loyal businessmen commanding the economy , a high oil price and @entity68 ’s need for energy aided him in stoking a remarkable recovery			0
mr @entity17 is seen by many as the figurehead of this @entity3 elite , many of whom have @entity107 bases and are synonymous with trophy wives , palatial homes , fleets of luxury cars and ocean - going armadas			2
but the @entity19 owner ranks only 13th in @entity11 ’s analysis , which is based on the latest @entity117 list for @entity3			2
it is headed by mining magnate mr @entity20 , who is said to be worth £ 11billion and owns @entity120 in @entity121 , a @entity122 mansion once the home of @entity124			0
number nine on the list is @entity37 , who is seen as a personal friend of @entity24			0
the enormous influence of the president is also demonstrated in the fortunes of those who have fallen out of favour			0
manufacturing and banking mogul @entity133 was thought to have been the first @entity135 billionaire and mr @entity24 ’s ‘ kingmaker ’ , but they fell out and he moved into exile in @entity107			0
he died in march after apparently taking his own life at his ex-wife ’s home in @entity142 , his wealth having fallen substantially			0
another early billionaire , @entity143 , lost the bulk of his fortune after he was jailed on ‘ political ’ grounds after financing opposition parties in @entity3			2
@entity3 now has one billionaire for every £ 6.9billion in household wealth			2
in the rest of the world , there is one for every £ 107billion			0
@entity3 metals and banking tycoons @entity32 and @entity39 ‘ if you look at how @entity3 have made their money and the sort of political ties that seem to be necessary to maintain it , there are just very few places where the situation is similar			0
