by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 14:18 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 21:07 est , 5 march 2014 president @entity3 is going to the mat to defend his controversial nominee to lead the @entity7 's civil rights division – a lawyer who once helped defend a notorious cop - killer – calling @entity11 ' efforts to block him a ' travesty			1
' @entity14 , who once participated in the appeals process for convicted murdered and liberal cult hero @entity16 , failed to win enough @entity18 votes to proceed to a final determination on his nomination			2
vice president @entity22 was on hand to cast a potential tiebreaking vote , but the 47 - 52 tally included ' no ' votes from eight @entity27 , including majority leader @entity28 , effectively killing the nomination			1
the @entity30 fired off a scathing statement from the president so quickly that it misspelled @entity14 's name			1
@entity14 , now president @entity3 's nominee to lead the @entity7 's civil rights division , led the litigation program of the @entity37 when it asked the @entity38 to void the death sentence of a cop - killer @entity16 , now a cult hero among death penalty opponents on the political left , escaped execution after @entity14 successfully argued that racial bias affected his jury selection the vote , @entity3 said in that statement , was ' a travesty based on wildly unfair character attacks against a good and qualified public servant			1
' ' as a lawyer , mr. @entity52 [ sic ] has played by the rules , ' @entity3 insisted			0
' and now , @entity56 politics have used the rules against him			0
the fact that his nomination was defeated solely based on his legal representation of a defendant runs contrary to a fundamental principle of our system of justice			0
' the @entity30 press office later sent reporters a corrected version of the president 's comments			2
@entity28 's defection to the @entity11 side was n't the only unusual feature of wednesday afternoon 's stunning defeat for the @entity3 administration			2
in november , @entity27 changed the rules that govern the confirmation of presidential nominees , deciding that a ' cloture ' vote – the motion to end debate and proceed to a final vote – should no longer require a supermajority of 60 votes to pass			0
instead , such nominees only need 51 votes			0
but @entity14 fell far short of that lower threshold			0
other democrats who joined @entity28 , a @entity92 , to vote against @entity3 's nominee were @entity94 of @entity95 , @entity96 of @entity97 , @entity98 of @entity99 , @entity100 of @entity101 , @entity102 of @entity103 , @entity104 of @entity105 and @entity106 of @entity107			1
@entity104 and @entity102 , in particular , face tough re-election fights in november			1
president @entity3 fired off a nasty statement complaining about the @entity18 's failure to approve @entity14 , after he touched down in @entity111 to give a speech defending his call for a higher minimum wage , in advance of a @entity117 fundraising trip to @entity118 @entity119 , widow of @entity121 police officer @entity120 , called @entity14 's nomination after he defended her husband 's murderer '' an abomination ... as if he had done something wonderful ' an aide to a @entity11 senator told @entity129 that politics were very much in play			1
' @entity28 switched sides to give those two [ @entity102 and @entity104 ] cover , ' said the staffer , who asked for anonymity because he was n't authorized to speak publicly			1
' neither of them wanted to see ads back home linking them to a cop - killer			0
' @entity28 , in fact , had slammed republicans for opposing @entity14 just moments before joining them , saying it was ' an affront to what it means to live in @entity1			1
' he also claimed the @entity11 's staunch resistance was part of a party - wide effort to disenfranchise black voters who side with @entity117 candidates in large numbers			2
' they do n't want people to vote and they especially do n't want poor people to vote , ' @entity28 said , before switching his allegiance			0
@entity16 , in prison for the 1981 murder of policeman @entity120 , received significant help from the @entity37 in successfully appealing his death sentence			1
@entity14 led those efforts as the organization 's litigation director , filing briefs with the @entity1 @entity38 arguing that racism tainted the jury selection in his case			2
politics : senate majority leader @entity28 ( @entity171 ) switched sides on wednesday to vote against @entity14 , giving vulnerable @entity27 facing tough re-election fights a rationale for opposing the nominee the @entity176 's ranking member sen. @entity177 of @entity178 ( @entity171 ) railed against @entity14 's race - based defense of a cop - killer , calling it ' a cause in search of legal justification ' a broad swath of opponents of the @entity3 nominee have included the @entity188 , who recalled a vicious period of fractured race relations that culminated in the murder of @entity120 , who was shot in the back , in the stomach , and in the face			1
officer @entity120 was murdered in 1981 while on a routine patrol in @entity121			2
bullet casings on the scene were tied to a gun registered to @entity16			0
@entity120 was shot first in the back , then in the front , and later in the face as he lay dying @entity203 , the organization 's president , called @entity14 's nomination ' an absolute slap in the face to every police officer , especially those who gave their lives in the line of duty			1
' ' there ’s outrage , there ’s resentment there ’s disapproval			0
you name it and our cops are feeling it , ' he said			0
sen. @entity177 of @entity178 , the @entity11 ' senior member on the powerful @entity176 , delivered the day 's most dramatic floor speech , outlining reasons why @entity14 should n't be handed the reins in the federal government 's chief civil rights enforcement agency			0
@entity177 said @entity14 's defense of @entity16 was a progressive ' cause in search of a legal justification			1
' ' it was a cause premised on the notion that this country ’s most notorious cop - killer , @entity16 , was a victim , ' he said			0
' and the police officers , prosecutors , and the entire judicial system were to blame			0
' the @entity176 narrowly approved @entity14 's nomination in february , setting up wednesday 's showdown on the @entity18 floor			2
@entity119 , the widow of @entity16 's victim , had written to the committee to say that ' officers who knew @entity249 , and who , like him , put their lives on the line everyday , must now witness @entity14 , a man proud to have chosen to aid the murderer of their friend , singled out for honors and high office by the government of the @entity1			1
' ' it is an abomination to now reward mr. @entity14 , as if he had done something wonderful			0

@entity14 helped *overturn* @entity16 's death sentence for the 1981 murder of @entity121 policeman @entity120
the president wants him to lead the @entity7 's office that deals with racial *discrimination*
@entity16 's defense *painted* the @entity272 - @entity1 convict , not his white patrolman victim , as the victim of a racist *courtroom* *lynching*
@entity3 called the vote a ' travesty ' in a *biting* statement fired off so quickly that the @entity30 misspelled @entity14 's name
eight @entity117 senators voted ' no ' including majority leader @entity28 , who switched his allegiance in order to give political cover to vulnerable liberal *incumbents* facing tough re-election fights
