by @entity0 a hunt is under way to find the rogue @entity4 government minister who said that an independent @entity5 could be allowed to keep the pound			2
months of careful planning by the @entity9 campaign was undone this weekend after the unnamed @entity11 figure said @entity13 's proposal for a ' currency union ' remained a viable option			1
chancellor @entity16 , chief secretary to the treasury @entity17 and other senior @entity20 politicians have again denied that a deal would be done if @entity5 vote yes in september			1
chancellor @entity16 is understood to be furious about the off - the - record remarks which have been seized on by first minister @entity13 to bolster his case for independence but there is private fury at the damage caused for @entity29 , which is already reeling from a bruising week			1
one high - profile mp told the @entity31 : ' when the source is found , he will be served up as a kebab for @entity16			2
' the mole hunt is focusing on junior @entity36 ministers from @entity37 , although defence secretary @entity38 did himself no favours yesterday when asked if he had spoken to the @entity41 newspaper which broke the story			1
' i do n't think so , ' he meekly replied			2
one senior @entity45 minister is also at the centre of on - going speculation			1
yesterday , first minister @entity13 could not hide his glee and said the unnamed minister was ' the man that was caught telling the truth '			2
should @entity5 be allowed to stay in a currency union with @entity4 if it splits ? he said the source had ' exposed ' the argument that voting no means leaving the pound as a ' campaign tactic ' , adding : ' it is a new found tactic , a merry wheeze , dreamt up , as we know from the @entity41 report , by [ better together leader ] @entity63 , and [ @entity65 adviser ] @entity66 persuaded the @entity67 to do it			1
' now it 's been seen through			0
the bluff has been called and the no campaign will have to take the political consequences , which will be severe			0
' @entity41 quoted the minister as saying : ' there would be a highly complex set of negotiations after a @entity77 vote , with many moving pieces			2
the @entity4 wants to keep @entity80 nuclear weapons at @entity81 and the @entity82 wants a currency union - you can see the outlines of a deal			1
' however , mr @entity13 yesterday insisted he would not use @entity80 as a bargaining chip			0
' the negotiations will take place about share of debt , not about things like @entity80 , which we are unambiguously opposed to , ' he said			0
@entity5 @entity45 leader @entity94 described the source of the original story as ' out of the loop '			2
the @entity31 understands @entity29 's plans to pay for ' negative ' adverts that would ' hammer home ' uncertainties over currency issues have been revisited there was fresh confusion today about the future of the pound , after @entity63 claimed a currency union between @entity5 and the rest of the @entity4 could be put to the vote			1
@entity36 , @entity110 and @entity45 have ruled out any prospect of an independent @entity5 continuing to use the pound in a currency union			1
but mr @entity63 , the former chancellor leading to @entity29 campaign , suggested the idea could be resurrected in the event of a @entity77 vote in september 's referendum			2
he told @entity118 : ' i think people in the rest of the @entity4 do need to have a say as to whether they go into a currency union with @entity5			1
' @entity124 , the @entity125 , said : ' i think most fair - minded observers will look at this and they will say on the one hand you have got an anonymous source speaking off the record , on the other hand , you have the governor of the @entity134 , and the very detailed advice of the permanent secretary to the treasury to the chancellor saying this is something we would not advise you to be part of			0
' there is no bluff , no bluster , there is no bullying			0
' however , according to a @entity148 poll published last week , before the unnamed minister spoke out , 45 per cent of voters believe that mr @entity16 and politicians from the other @entity20 parties are bluffing about their decision to block a deal to share the pound , while 40 per cent said they believe what they said			1
in a joint statement , mr @entity16 and mr @entity17 said : ' there will not be a currency union in the event of independence			1
' the only way to keep the @entity4 pound is to stay in the @entity4			0
walking out of the @entity4 means walking out of the @entity4 pound			0
a currency union will not work because it would not be in @entity5 's interests and would not be in the @entity4 's interests			1
' @entity5 would have no control over mortgage rates and would be binding its hands on tax and funding for vital public services			0
' the @entity82 are proposing to divorce the rest of the @entity4 but want to keep the joint bank account and credit card			0
the @entity4 would not put its taxpayers at risk of bailing out a foreign country and its banks			0
@entity180 would n't pass it and the people would n't accept it			0
any suggestion to the contrary is wrong			0
' a senior @entity110 source said : ' without being too melodramatic , they have a duty to find this person , explain that they do n't speak for the government and then put them up against a wall and shoot them			1
there is no bluff or bluster '			0

unnamed coalition minister claimed currency union is a viable option
@entity16 ruled out the idea , backed by @entity45 and @entity110
defence secretary @entity38 says he ' does n't think ' he is to blame
