@entity0 was ' too young ' for bowel cancer to be considered @entity2 was 23 weeks ' pregnant with her first baby when she suddenly woke in the middle of the night with a sharp , shooting pain in her side			1
she visited her gp 's out - of - hours service but was reassured to hear her baby 's heartbeat and be told all was well			1
the pain was probably ' ligament strain ' caused by the weight of the growing baby			2
' i was ecstatic to be having a baby - i 've always wanted to be a mum , ' says @entity0 , 34			1
' all my scans showed my baby was healthy , so i did n't think anything more about that pain			2
' she now knows it was the first sign there was a grave threat to her baby 's life , and her own			2
four weeks later her daughter , @entity27 , was born prematurely and later died			2
then @entity0 was found to have bowel cancer			1
doctors now think @entity27 's death was linked to her mother 's cancer , with a blood clot breaking away from the tumour , damaging @entity0 's placenta and cutting off the food supply to her unborn baby			1
however , it took four months after @entity27 's death for @entity0 to be diagnosed			1
the problem was her age - she was ' too young ' for bowel cancer to be considered			1
@entity0 , who lives in @entity43 , @entity44 , with her husband @entity45 , a 35 - year - old it consultant , says : ' looking back , i had textbook symptoms - exhaustion , intermittent stomach pains , increasingly bad diarrhoea , blood in my stools and bleeding			1
the disease is @entity55 's second - biggest cancer killer , claiming 16,000 lives a year			1
the number of under - 50s diagnosed has been gradually rising - to around 2,100 a year			1
but a recent survey by the charity @entity61 of patients under 50 found that 42 per cent of the women had visited their gp at least five times before being referred for tests			2
indeed , @entity0 , a supply planner for an it firm , was examined five times by different doctors and midwives , who all missed her symptoms , despite a golf ball - sized lump appearing on her stomach after her pregnancy			2
by the time she was diagnosed , @entity0 had stage three to four cancer , meaning the tumour had broken through her bowel wall			1
she had to undergo a seven - hour operation to remove the 6cm growth , followed by six months of chemo and radiotherapy			2
but her experience is not uncommon , says @entity85 , chief executive of @entity86 @entity55 : ' we hear from many younger people who express frustration at not getting a diagnosis and support			2
' ‘ bowel cancer is often associated with older patients over 50 - but younger people can , and do , regularly get it , as the tragic story of @entity97 recently highlighted , ' adds @entity98 , consultant gastroenterologist at @entity99 , @entity100			1
@entity97 , 19 , raised more than £ 3million during his three - year battle against multiple tumours @entity97 , the 19 - year - old fundraiser who died last week from the disease , told the @entity106 earlier this month of his anger that he was not diagnosed for six months after his symptoms started			1
this was despite his family history of @entity112 syndrome , a genetic condition that raises the risk of bowel cancer			1
' if it had been caught earlier , it could have led to a better prognosis , ' he said			2
@entity0 , too , eventually discovered she had @entity112 syndrome			0
bowel cancer is very treatable if detected early - 93 per cent of patients who are found to have a small tumour on the bowel wall live for five years or more			1
yet only 9 per cent of cases are diagnosed at this stage - most are diagnosed at stage three			1
so , the overall five - year survival rate for bowel - cancer patients is just 54 per cent			1
because patients and many doctors assume that young people wo n't get bowel cancer , they are particularly likely to have advanced - stage tumours at the time of diagnosis			1
bleeding or blood in faeces a change in bowel habits lasting more than three weeks exhaustion unexplained weight loss abdominal pain see bowelcanceruk.org.uk ; @entity142 ( phone 08450 719 301 ) ; and familyhistory bowelcancer.wordpress.com / cancer charities are campaigning to improve diagnosis for all ages - they want new diagnostic guidelines for gps and earlier screening procedures			1
@entity151 , @entity153 's national clinical director for cancer , says : ' the @entity55 lags behind much of @entity155 in terms of survival from bowel cancer			1
we need to change this , and this includes identifying it better in patients under 50			0
' national gp guidelines state only patients aged 60 and over should be automatically referred to hospital for tests if they have one symptom			0
patients aged 40 to 60 must exhibit two or more symptoms			0
for under 40s , there is often an assumption the symptoms must be something else , says @entity176 , chief executive of the charity @entity178			0
' we 've had patients with red - flag symptoms - such as blood in their stools - being told " you 've got @entity185 " or " you 're too young to have cancer " by their gps			1
' four weeks after @entity0 's initial scare , she was unable to feel her baby moving			0
tests revealed @entity27 had stopped growing , and she had to be delivered by emergency caesarean			0
after her birth , in july 2011 , she was taken to a specialist neo-natal unit at @entity196 but died in hospital a few weeks later			2
two weeks afterwards , @entity0 experienced more shooting pains			0
with her pregnancy bump gone , there was also a noticeable lump on the side of her waist			0
her midwife said it was probably an infection , and @entity0 was given antibiotics			0
but her health deteriorated rapidly and she had to take six weeks off work with exhaustion , which her gp put down to depression			0
within three months of @entity27 's death , @entity0 was suffering from nausea and abdominal pain			2
unable to get a gp 's appointment , she went to @entity217 but was told the lump was possibly an infection related to her caesarean			0
doctors performed a cervical smear test ( which was subsequently lost ) and sent her home with paracetamol			0
@entity97 with his mother @entity225 whilst prime minister @entity226 visited him ' i got the impression they did n't take me very seriously , ' she recalls			1
soon after , she was vomiting up to ten times a day , feeling dizzy and weak , passing blood and experiencing chronic diarrhoea			0
at an emergency gp appointment , she was examined by a different doctor who immediately referred her to hospital ; after several days of tests , she was diagnosed with cancer			1
four days before @entity239 , @entity0 underwent surgery			0
' we thought we 'd be enjoying our first @entity239 as a family , but instead i was in hospital , grieving for the loss of our little girl and terrified about the future , ' she recalls			0
' my treatment might have been less of an ordeal if my cancer had been picked up sooner			2
it makes me quite angry to think if i 'd been 60 , it would have been picked up more quickly			0
' but even obvious symptoms are often missed by doctors , says mr @entity176			0
' i am not blaming @entity254 , but we need to not be shy of pointing out where things are going wrong			0
the default position should be for a gp to rule out cancer , just to be safe			2
' ' it can also be problematic if patients do n’t have obvious symptoms such as bleeding ' , says dr @entity98			0
‘ they may instead have vaguer symptoms such as tiredness , unexplained weight loss or abdominal pain , which could be attributed to being symptoms of other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome or @entity273 ’s disease			2
' public awareness is also an issue			0
a survey in march by health insurer @entity277 found nearly half of men could n't name one symptom of bowel cancer			1
indeed , @entity282 , 49 , had never heard of it before his diagnosis in 2008			0
' i was totally shocked , ' says the father of four , who lives in @entity287 with wife @entity288 , 48			0
' i did n't know bowel cancer existed			1
' @entity282 visited his gp five times in nine months with extreme tiredness and loose stools			0
his symptoms were attributed to stress - his mother had recently died and he has a high - pressure job as head of capital investment for @entity300 and @entity301 - and then @entity185			1
joining friends and family to complete a @entity305 challenge creating hearts with hands ' but i knew something was n't right , ' says @entity282			0
' he was finally diagnosed with stage three bowel cancer in november 2008 , after his gp did an internal examination and felt a lump			1
@entity282 underwent three months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy , followed by surgery , another six months of chemotherapy and a second operation			0
he now has to use a colostomy bag but has been in remission for five years			0
currently , screening is only available to people aged 60 - plus			2
they are sent home tests , which involve sending a stool sample to a lab. but the @entity327 is now looking at a new procedure , bowel scope screening , which involves a partial colonoscopy - examining only the lower bowel			1
a major @entity55 trial of 55 to 64 year olds showed that people screened this way were 43 per cent less likely to die from bowel cancer , and 33 per cent less likely to develop it			1
this is because the procedure is usually successful at detecting small growths known as polyps , which can become cancerous			0
the screening - which would be offered to everyone aged 55 and over - is now being piloted			2
campaigners hope it will be made available nationally by 2016			0
‘ this is a really important development and should make a big difference to bowel cancer outcomes , ’ says dr @entity98 , who runs the family history of @entity86 clinic at @entity99 , specialising in hereditary components of the disease			1
it wo n't , however , help younger patients such as @entity0			0
before her chemotherapy , she and @entity45 had nine embryos frozen via @entity356			0
however she is worried she may pass on @entity112 syndrome , so the couple are considering what to do			0
but she says : ' i am still here , i have a life ahead of me - and i hope my story will help others to be diagnosed in time			1

@entity97 died after a four - year battle with bowel cancer
19 - year - old raised millions for the @entity370 before his death
number of under - 50s diagnosed is gradually rising to around 2,100 a year
