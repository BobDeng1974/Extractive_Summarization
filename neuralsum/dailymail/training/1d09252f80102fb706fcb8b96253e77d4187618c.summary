this is the jaw - dropping moment a lightning storm erupted in an ash cloud as a notorious volcano spewed hot lava towards villages below			1
photographer @entity7 ’s stunning photos of the volatile @entity9 volcano in @entity10 are a fascinating display of the raw beauty and frightening power of planet earth			1
as the ash cloud billows into the night sky a barrage of lightning bolts crackle from deep within it – creating a mesmerising scene that looks like the entrance to the underworld			1
while it is an amazing display the 8,000ft volcano , in @entity42 , has proven to be deadly since it erupted in 2010 after being dormant for an estimated 400 years			1
on this occasion some small villages were wiped out by the lava flow and many acres of farmland were buried by ash , the photographer said			2
known as a pyroclastic flow , the deadly mix of burning hot ash , gas and lava can quickly blanket large areas , exterminating anything and everything in its path			0
the 8,000ft volcano , in @entity42 , has proven to be deadly since it erupted in 2010 after being dormant for an estimated 400 years on several occasions the @entity9 volcano has erupted and blanketed villages and surrounding farmland in severe feet of ash but if that was n't destructive enough , the @entity9 volcano oozes rivers of scorching hot magma and creates blasts of swirling heat tornadoes			1
and despite the obvious dangers , this did n't stop @entity7 , 50 , from photographing the explosive action			2
he said : ‘ pyroclastic flows are mainly silent , gliding along at high speeds like a hovercraft			0
they are absolutely deadly , all life forms that come in to contact with it would die instantly			0
‘ seeing such a strong and powerful pyroclastic flow from very near is indeed a little bit frightening			0
' photographer @entity7 said some small villages were wiped out by lava flow while others were covered in a layer of thick ash mr @entity7 , an enthusiast who travels the world to photograph eruptions , said catching the volcano at its highest level phase was ' pure luck ' known as a pyroclastic flow , the deadly mix of burning hot ash , gas and rock can quickly blanket large areas @entity7 said : ‘ nobody was killed by this particular eruption but a few weeks later during its lower activity , one single but exceptionally strong pyroclastic flow did indeed kill some nearby observers			1
’ he said a few small villages were hit by the lava flow and ‘ burned completely ’ , but more villages and surrounding farmland were covered in three feet of ash			0
he added : ‘ all crops were destroyed and its inhabitants were evacuated			0
‘ the mini tornadoes are caused by the hot air from the pyroclastic flow mixing with surrounding air which generates high momentum , spinning air combined with fine dust and ash			2
crops were destroyed and residents were forced to flee their homes after the @entity9 volcano erupted and spewed molten rock and ash @entity7 poses for a photograph as lava spews from the mouth of the @entity9 volcano in @entity42 , @entity10 ‘ a few days before , while standing near to a lava field on @entity124 , such a tornado formed and hit me			1
‘ hats , backpacks and equipment were sent flying through the air for hundreds of metres , i was completely encased in dust			0
‘ although a mixture of low and high activity had occurred over the months , catching the volcano at its highest level phase was pure luck			0

photographer @entity7 captured the fascinating scene at the volatile @entity9 volcano in @entity42
as the ash cloud billows into the night sky a barrage of lightning bolts crackle from deep within it
it is believed the lightning is a result of fine ash grains *colliding* and creating huge amounts of static electricity
