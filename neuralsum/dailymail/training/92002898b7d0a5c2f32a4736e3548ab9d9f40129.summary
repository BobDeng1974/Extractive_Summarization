‘ i lost all confidence in him , ’ she said			0

i thought , they have got the whole tumour out so why are they frying his brain ? ‘ i fear they are going to fry my son ’s brain when there are other ways we could proceed			1

but they are going after one cell that might be there			0
i am convinced it is not there because of the scans and because his spinal fluid is clear			0
‘ i do n’t want to fry his brain and have his quality of life ruined just on the off chance there is a floating cell that is going to multiply			2
