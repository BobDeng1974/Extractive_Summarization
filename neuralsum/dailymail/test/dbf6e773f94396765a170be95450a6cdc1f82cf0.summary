palaeontologists are referring to @entity1 as a ' platypus ' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of features a new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants , despite being closely related to notorious carnivore @entity9 , has been discovered in @entity11			1
palaeontologists are referring to @entity1 as a ' platypus ' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics , including its small skull and feet			1
these features are more like those seen on long - neck dinosaurs			2
the animal is proving to be an evolutionary jigsaw puzzle because it belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs - which includes the famous meat eaters @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity9 , from which birds today evolved - but was a vegetarian			2
the presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds , but @entity1 shows that a meat - free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought			1
the dinosaur from the @entity36 , around 145 million years ago , is named after the country where it was discovered , as well as honouring @entity39 , who discovered the bones			0
the seven - year - old came across the fossils at the @entity43 in southern @entity11 when he and his sister , @entity44 were looking for decorative stones			1
they were playing at the site because their geologist parents , @entity51 and @entity52 were studying rocks with the aim to better understand the formation of the @entity57 mountain range			0
experts initially thought @entity39 had unearthed several species , due to @entity1 ' unusual combination of features			1
however , more than a dozen specimens have now been excavated , including four skeletons , which demonstrate that the dinosaur combined a variety of unique anatomical traits			2
the dinosaur has been likened to a platypus , which is one of the most unusual creatures in the animal kingdom , because it 's one of very few mammal to lay eggs , has venomous spurs and a paddle - shaped tail like a beaver , as well as webbed feet and a bill like a duck , among other idiosyncrasies			1
most of the specimens discovered are the size of a turkey , but some isolated bones reveal the maximum size of @entity1 was around 10 feet ( three metres ) long , according to @entity11 and @entity88 palaeontologists from institutions including the @entity90 who have studied the skeletons			1
unusual : fossils dating from the @entity36 , around 145 million years ago , reveal an unusual combination of features from various dinosaur groups , including relatively short arms , a long neck , small head and leaf - shaped teeth ( pictured ) bizarre : palaeontologists are referring to @entity1 as a ' platypus ' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics including its small skull and feet , which are more like those seen on long - neck dinosaurs			1
the dinosaur itself , has a lengthy neck and must have had good balance ( illustrated ) palaeontologists are referring to @entity1 as a ' platypus ' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics			1
the @entity118 dinosaur lived 145 million years ago			0
it has a small skull and feet , which are more like those seen on long - neck dinosaurs			2
@entity1 has robust forelimbs similar to @entity125 theropods such as @entity126 , but has two blunt fingers instead of sharp claws , like the @entity26 , for example			1
@entity1 ' pelvic girdle resembles that of the ornithischian dinosaurs - beaked , herbivorous dinosaurs such as stegosaurs and @entity135			2
it has leaf - shaped teeth , similar to those of primitive long - neck dinosaurs			1
most unusually , the animal was a vegetarian , despite belonging the theopod family of dinosaurs , which were mostly fierce meat eaters			0
the dinosaur ranged in size from as small as a turkey to 10 ft ( three metres ) long			2
they discovered that @entity1 has robust forelimbs similar to @entity125 theropods such as @entity126			1
but its hands have two blunt fingers , instead of sharp claws like its fellow theropod the @entity26			0
@entity1 ' pelvic girdle resembles that of the ornithischian dinosaurs - beaked , herbivorous dinosaurs such as stegosaurs and @entity135 - whereas it is actually classified in the other basic dinosaur division – @entity162 , according to the study published in the journal @entity161			2
the different parts of the body of @entity1 were adapted to a particular diet and way of life , which was similar to other groups of dinosaurs			2
as a result of these habits , different regions of the body of @entity1 evolved resembling those present in other , unrelated groups of dinosaurs - a phenomenon called evolutionary convergence			2
@entity1 represents one of the most extreme cases of evolutionary convergence			0
for example , its leaf - shaped teeth are similar to those of primitive long - neck dinosaurs because they were selected over millions of years as a result of a similar diet between these two lineages of dinosaurs			1
' @entity1 can be considered a " platypus " dinosaur because different parts of its body resemble those of other dinosaur groups due to mosaic convergent evolution , ’ @entity189 , a researcher at the @entity90 explained			1
painstaking : close inspection of the fossils revealed that @entity1 has robust forelimbs similar to @entity125 theropods such as @entity126			1
but its hands have two blunt fingers , instead of sharp claws like its fellow theropod , the @entity26			0
the process of excavating the skeleton is shown the presence of herbivorous theropods was , up until now , only known in close relatives of birds but @entity1 ( illustrated left ) shows that a meat - free diet was acquired much earlier than thought			1
its fossils were found at the @entity43 in southern @entity11 , marked with a red star on the map , right ‘ in this process , a region or regions of an organism resemble others of unrelated species because of a similar mode of life and evolutionary pressures			1
‘ @entity230 provides a good example of how evolution works in deep time and it is one of the most interesting cases of convergent evolution documented in the history of life			0
' @entity1 shows how much data is still completely unknown about the early diversification of major dinosaur groups			1
’ he believes that this study will force palaeontologists to take more care in identifying fragmented and isolated dinosaur bones			0
dr @entity245 , of the @entity246 in @entity247 , @entity88 , led the research on @entity230			0
seven - year - old @entity39 ( pictured left ) came across the fossils when he and his sister , @entity44 , were looking for decorative stones			0
he was at the site while his his geologist parents , @entity51 ( pictured right ) and @entity52 were studying rocks with the aim to better understand the formation of the @entity57 experts initially thought @entity39 had unearthed several species , due to @entity1 ' unusual combination of features			1
here , a palaeontologist painstakingly excavates the fossils he said : ‘ @entity1 is the first complete dinosaur from the @entity125 found in @entity11 and represents one of the most complete and anatomically correct documented theropod dinosaurs from the southern hemisphere			1
‘ although plant - eating theropods have been recorded in @entity270 and @entity271 , this is the first time a theropod with this characteristic has been found in a southern landmass			2
‘ @entity1 was an odd plant - eating dinosaur only to be found in @entity11			1
‘ however , the recurrent discovery in beds of the @entity43 of its bones and skeletons clearly demonstrates that @entity1 was , by far , the most abundant dinosaur in southwest @entity283 145 million years ago			2
' the lineage of huge meat - eating dinosaurs that transformed into agile flying birds were able to survive because they shrank over the course of 50 million years			0
this is the conclusion scientists came to after constructing a detailed family tree of dinosaurs and their bird descendants , mapping the unlikely transformation			0
the tree showed that the branch of theropod dinosaurs , which gave rise to modern birds , were the only dinosaurs that kept getting smaller			0
the lineage of huge meat - eating dinosaurs that transformed into agile flying birds were able to survive because they shrank over 50 million years			0
this is the conclusion scientists came to after constructing a detailed family tree of dinosaurs and their bird descendants , mapping their unlikely transformation @entity307 , meaning ‘ beast - footed ’ , were a group of dinosaurs which include the carnivorous dinosaurs @entity9 , velociraptor and @entity312			0
' these bird ancestors also evolved new adaptations , such as feathers , wishbones and wings , four times faster than other dinosaurs , ' said co-author @entity320 , a palaeontologist at the @entity321			0
lead author associate professor @entity322 , from the @entity323 , said : ' birds evolved through a unique phase of sustained miniaturisation in dinosaurs			0
' ' being smaller and lighter in the land of giants , with rapidly evolving anatomical adaptations , provided these bird ancestors with new ecological opportunities , such as the ability to climb trees , glide and fly			0
‘ ultimately , this evolutionary flexibility helped birds survive the deadly meteorite impact which killed off all their dinosaurian cousins			0
' researchers examined over 1,500 anatomical traits of dinosaurs to reconstruct their family tree			0
they used mathematical modelling to trace evolving adaptions and changing body size over time and across dinosaur branches .			0

@entity1 was discovered by a child in southern @entity11
late @entity125 dinosaur was a herbivore , causing experts to *rethink* the idea that vegetarian theropods were close relatives of birds
fossils reveal unusual features from various dinosaur groups , including short arms , a long neck , small head and leaf - shaped teeth
dinosaur has been liked to a platypus because of its mixture of traits
