although the impressive grid connects all major railroad freight houses and many commercial establishments in downtown @entity2 , few people ever saw this system from construction in 1899 to its abandonment in 1959			0
it was n't until a contractor kicked a hole into the side of the one of the bores during the 1992 floods that the doomed passageways became big news			0
out of business : almost a century after construction , the doomed @entity2 tunnels had helped facilitate the @entity26 of 1992 , despite chief engineer @entity27 ¿ s original intention that measures to prevent flooding be maintained @entity2 : the @entity31 and @entity32 built the first 26 miles of this concrete tunnel by 1905			1
but the @entity34 which took over , building another 60 miles , went bankrupt in 1909 and construction stopped multi-purpose : in 1912 , the @entity37 started using the track to move merchandise , coal and ash before abandoning the unprofitable tunnels in 1959 in 1899 , @entity31 and @entity32 laid narrow - gauge railway in underground tunnels to help it excavate the tunnels , according to @entity46			1
under the watchful eye of chief engineer @entity27 , the company built the first 26 miles of tunnel to hold telegraph and telephone cables			2
in 1905 , the @entity34 took over construction , expanding the network to 60 miles before it went bankrupt in 1909			2
the network , widely considered cursed , was taken over by the @entity37 which sold the communication installations and cables but continued to use the track to move merchandise , coal and ash in 1912			1
the group was finally forced to abandon the unprofitable tunnels in 1959			0
electric cars for hauling mail : the two - foot gauge @entity65 car waiting at the platform of @entity67 in front of a @entity70 @entity65 car original plans : this city of @entity2 subway plan was never built @entity74 : this sectional view of the @entity34 's abandoned tunnels show tracks diverging at various points on its way : this freight , reportedly made by @entity82 , leaves @entity84 's basement while the grid was n't profitable , it was versatile			1
the constant underground air temperature of 55 degrees @entity88 led to a curious second line of business — air conditioning			0
several movie theaters bought tunnel air to keep audiences cool			1
after it was abandoned , many @entity95 forgot about the concrete tunnels until april 1992 when one of them under the @entity99 near @entity100 was punctured , flooding most of the system and two dozen downtown buildings with open tunnel connections			2
today , some sections of the tunnels are used for utility and communication lines			0
inventive : the constant underground air temperature of @entity110 led to a second line of business ¿ air conditioning			0
several theaters bought tunnel air to keep audiences cool split : the original caption described this 1904 image as ' a typical street intersection ' opening of @entity2 subway for freight traffic : on july 7 , 1905 , an 11 - car train was dispatched from the @entity126 freight house			1
these five cars were delivered to the @entity129 freight house and the elevator in the foreground goes down to the tunnel mysterious : this three - way intersection at @entity134 and @entity135 in @entity2 in 1902 looks empty and eerie			0

the @entity31 and @entity137 built the *expansive* tunnel network around 1900 to hold cables
when they went bankrupt , the @entity34 took over and used the tunnels to move merchandise and coal
62 miles of tunnels criss - crossed *underneath* the city
the tunnels were six feet wide and *7.5* feet high with one - foot thick concrete walls , *powered* by *overhead* *trolley* wires
several theaters bought tunnel air to keep audiences cool
