a designer has won a dispute with angry neighbours who complained about the pink door on her new fashion school			1
@entity5 , 50 , wanted to give the building in @entity7 , @entity8 , a unique touch by painting the front door in an eye - catching colour after she moved in last september			1
she chose a bright fuchsia pink to highlight her new working space - but it was a move that attracted a fierce backlash from locals who branded the new front as ‘ absolutely vile ’			1
but , after a lengthy dispute , @entity8 has now told her she will not have to change the colour of her door on the building , which is the former home of the town 's library			1
one resident said : ‘ i did n't complain to the council personally as i am all for new businesses coming into the town , but i feel they have just spoiled what was once a stunning building			2
the local , who who wished to remain anonymous , added : ‘ any colour would have done apart from that disgusting bright pink - it is really an eyesore and not a good advert for the town			2
’ but ms @entity5 said : ‘ the reason we painted the door pink was because that colour is our brand identity			1
you can keep it : @entity8 has now told her she will not have to change the colour of her door ‘ when we moved in last year the front door was really needing done up as the paint was peeling off - but i did not expect any of this bad feeling for simply painting the entrance in a bright colour			1
’ ms @entity5 added that a volunteer was approached by a ‘ pompous ’ man while she was painting the door , who was ‘ very rude to her , saying that it was an absolutely vile colour ’			1
but she insisted there had also been a lot of support in the local community			0
ms @entity5 said : ‘ i have had overwhelming public support from our community and beyond , and it was trending on our community website heart of @entity7			1
‘ there were over 300 positive comments ranging from how it made them smile when they passed it , it brightened up the town and how it is a lovely creative space where students of all ages can come and express their creativity			0
’ darker colour : the door of @entity30 , which is in a conservation area , before it was painted pink after speaking to the council , with planners even threatening to paint the door dark brown themselves , ms @entity5 was pleased they decided to allow her to keep the colour			1
she said : ‘ i am so happy that we have the support of our council , and they are moving with the times , listening to what the people actually want			0
‘ the complaint about the pink door has actually shown me what love and support we have in our community and how people want change			2
‘ it is a lovely building with a history , but it deserves some new life in it so that future artists and designers can make their own history , rather than letting yet another old building stay empty and deteriorate			0
‘ the building is council - owned and the fashion school is on a six - month pilot , but hopefully these complaints will not affect the final decision to allow us to stay here			0
