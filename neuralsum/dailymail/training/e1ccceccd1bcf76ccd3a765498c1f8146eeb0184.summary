i avoid confrontation whenever i can , i always want everyone to like me			2
i let people talk about me , say anything to my face , and i just take it , laugh it off , even when i know they are intentionally trying to disrespect me			2
i mostly blame the soft schools i went to , which fostered within me a feeling that i 'm a huge p * * * * , as i never got into fights			0
i used to get verbally bullied every day in middle school and high school , by kids that are half my size			2
i would never fight back , just get sad & feel like no one wanted to be my friend , when in fact i was just being socially awkward			0
most people in that situation are witty & quick with sarcastic replies , i never have been			0
i 'm awkward around people a lot of the time because i simply do n't know how to act around them			0
' - april 29 , 2013 , @entity12 writes his father : ' people call me a nigger to my face			1
and i laughed it off			0
because i am too nice of a person			0
they say terrible things about my sister			0
i do n't do anything			0
i suppose it 's white private school conditioning , turning the other cheek			0

i got punked again today			0
like a little b * * * *			0

- january , 2013 , @entity12 writes his mother : ' i have really severe depression			1
there are many instances where i ca n't get out of bed			0
. i 'm really embarrassed to talk about it with anyone in person , i tried to with you when i was home but i could n't do it			0
i 've managed to keep it under control for the most part on my own			0
anyways , i really do wan na take care of it , because it is debilitating & keeps me from reaching my potential in all facets of life			0
' - may 28 , 2013 : @entity12 writes his mother : ' i just do n't really see the point in things			1
it 's a major accomplishment for me if i brush my teeth or eat more than 1 meal in a day on off days			0
it 's not that i 'm sad , just unmotivated			0
' @entity12 , a @entity153 standout in his second season with the @entity8 , left the team in october citing ' emotional ' reasons			1
it was later revealed that @entity11 and other players created a ' culture ' of harassment in the @entity8 ' locker room , and that @entity12 often was the target			1
@entity11 - considered one of the @entity23 's ' dirtiest ' players - claimed his alleged harassment of @entity12 was all in good fun , and that @entity12 was exaggerating the claims of verbal abuse			1
@entity19 ' report , however , finds that @entity12 's claims are genuine - and that they were the primary reason he left the team			1
' the report rejects any suggestion that @entity12 manufactured claims of abuse after the fact to cover up an impetuous decision to leave the team			1
contemporaneous text messages that @entity12 sent to his parents and others months before he left the @entity8 — which have never before been made public — corroborate his account that the persistent harassment by his teammates caused him significant emotional distress , ' @entity19 writes in his report			1
in many of the messages @entity12 wrote to his family he describes being depressed because people think he 's ' soft , ' or a ' pushover ' who lets people walk all over him			1
' i care about my legacy as a professional athlete			0
but i 'm miserable currently			0
a therapist & medication wo n't help me gain the respect of my teammates			0
i really do n't know what to do @entity203 , ' @entity12 wrote to his mother in an email on april 2013			1
however , @entity19 found that it was not the other players ' intention to make @entity12 quit			1
' @entity12 ’s teammates did not intend to drive @entity12 from the team or cause him lasting emotional injury , ' @entity19 writes			1
@entity19 concludes that , ' in short , the treatment of @entity12 and others in the @entity8 organization at times was offensive and unacceptable in any environment , including the world professional football players inhabit			1
a young football player who has the skills to play at the highest level , and who also happens to be quiet and reserved , should have the opportunity to pursue a career in the @entity23 without being subjected to harassment from his teammates			2
' @entity8 owner @entity227 issued a statement addressing @entity19 ' report			2
' we have just received the report from @entity19 and will review it in detail before responding relative to the findings			2
when we asked the @entity23 to conduct this independent review , we felt it was important to take a step back and thoroughly research these serious allegations			0
as an organization , we are committed to a culture of team - first accountability and respect for one another , ' @entity227 said in the statement			2
@entity11 also has responded to the report through his attorney , @entity247			1
' mr. @entity19 ' @entity23 report is replete with errors			2
the facts do not support a conclusion that @entity12 's mental health , drug use , or on field performance issues were related to the treatment by his teammates , ' @entity247 says in a statement			2
' it is disappointing that mr. @entity19 would have gotten it so wrong , but not surprising			0
the truth , as reported by the @entity8 players and as shown by the evidence , is that @entity12 was never bullied by @entity11 or any member of the @entity264 line , ' he continues			1
we are analyzing the entire report and will release a thorough analysis as soon as it is ready			2
' ' goon ' : @entity11 is widely considered one of the ' dirtiest ' players in the @entity23 bullied : @entity12 wrote in several messages to his parents that he 's ' too nice ' and a pushover , which made him a target for harassment			1

the report found that @entity33 and @entity36 also bullied @entity12
@entity33 , @entity36 and @entity11 also harassed another young lineman and a team trainer
@entity12 wrote ' *heartbreaking* ' emails to his mother prior to his decision to leave the team
the @entity8 will now decide what - if any - punishment to give @entity11 , @entity33 and @entity36
@entity11 responded to the report through his attorney , calling it ' replete with errors '
