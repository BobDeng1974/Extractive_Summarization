she said : ' there 's an awful lot of unconscious assumptions and judgments that are made when people do n't realise that that 's what they 're doing			1
' the more used they are to having women , and people from ethnic minorities , around , the less that 's a problem because they know how we behave			2
' but if you hardly ever see a woman , you do n't really know how to assess somebody who 's a candidate , ' @entity30 reports			1
@entity1 argued the profession is still weighted in favour of well - known lawyers and that it would benefit from greater diversity			2
