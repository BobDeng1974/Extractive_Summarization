by @entity0 published : 03:59 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 06:14 est , 10 march 2014 killer : convicted double - murderer @entity3 killed @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , while he was on day release last july prisoners are set to lose their automatic right to day release following a series of serious crimes committed by offenders temporarily out of jail , including murder , robbery and drug smuggling			1
under new rules , inmates will be allowed out only for a specific purpose , such as work experience , and prisoners on day release will have to wear tags			1
they will also have to earn the privilege of day release through good behaviour and demonstrating a commitment to change - rather than automatically qualifying as they have previously			1
convicted double - murderer @entity3 's killing of @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , while he was on day release last july is among three serious failings cited by the @entity30 for the change			1
prisoners convicted of the most serious crimes must meet new ' restricted ' criteria which will be stringently assessed by probation officers and other professionals			2
temporary release is supposedly an opportunity to help inmates begin to adjust to life on the outside			2
but the spate of criminality prompted a review by justice secretary @entity45 to confront what appeared to be a gaping hole in the supervision of extremely dangerous men			1
@entity3 , who had already killed twice , was on his first unescorted day out of prison when he went to rob a house and killed mr @entity4 , 66 , who had gone to his neighbour @entity52 's aid			1
family man : @entity3 , who had already killed twice , was on his first unescorted day out of prison when he went to rob a house and killed mr @entity4 ( circled above ) who had gone to neighbour @entity52 's aid in another case , convicted murderer @entity56 committed 11 armed robberies from bookmakers over six months as he worked as a van driver on day release			1
the 52 - year - old had been serving a life sentence for battering a sociology lecturer to death with a hammer while high on crack			2
he was caught after crashing into an unmarked police car			0
@entity56 , from @entity69 , was jailed for life in 1996 , but was released on day leave in 2010 from @entity72 in @entity73			1
in september 2011 he was jailed indefinitely at the @entity74			0
offenders : meanwhile , murderer @entity56 ( left ) committed 11 armed robberies as he worked as a van driver on day release , and drug dealer @entity79 ( right ) ran a £ 14million cocaine - smuggling operation a third offender , convicted drug dealer @entity79 , ran a £ 14million cocaine - smuggling operation while on day release from @entity86 open prison , @entity87			1
even though he was serving eight years for a plot to smuggle heroin into @entity90 , he was allowed out to run a second - hand shop , which he used as a front to smuggle cocaine into the country inside old furniture			2
in 2010 he was jailed for a further 26 years after he was found guilty of conspiracy to import @entity98 and @entity99 drugs			0
review : the spate of criminality prompted a review by justice secretary @entity45 ( pictured ) day release is given to hundreds of prisoners every year to allow them to prepare for their eventual freedom			1
but a report published last year revealed staggering levels of complacency around how such cases are handled			0
inspectors said such inmates were being allowed out on day release without proper checks on whether they still pose a threat			1
at one unnamed prison , standards had become so lax that formal risk assessments had been abandoned			0
some officials had spent so long in a prisoner 's company they ended up believing the inmate 's own twisted account of their crime			0
in some cases , reports amounted to little more than ' recording the prisoners ' expressed views ' , the report said			0
prisons minister @entity130 said that he was not willing to see public safety compromised by a ' system that has been too lax up to now			0
' ' temporary release can be an important tool in helping offenders reintegrate but it should not be an automatic right and we must do all we can to ensure that it does not lead to a permanent blight on innocent members of society , ' he told @entity143			0
' in future when prisoners are let out on licence i want to be sure they are tagged and strictly risk - assessed so we know where they have been and can be sure sure that they have been tested in the community under strict conditions before being released			0
' campaigners have criticised the move - saying there had been only a few failures			0
@entity156 , director of the @entity157 , told the @entity158 : ‘ for a government committed to rehabilitation , justice ministers should feel ashamed that only a quarter of men , and fewer than one in 10 women , leave prison with a job to go to , and proud that their well - established release on temporary licence programme has worked over years to help thousands of prisoners go straight on release			2
‘ now , in the face of a thankfully few terrible cases , and for the sake of a tough headline , they risk destroying a programme that has proved its worth instead of investigating its few failures and learning from its many successes			0

hundreds of prisoners automatically qualify for day release every year
but under new rules , they will be allowed out only for a specific purpose
they will also have to earn privilege of day release through good behaviour
spate of criminality prompted review by justice secretary @entity45
murderer @entity3 killed @entity4 during day release in 2013
criminals @entity56 and @entity79 also offended while out of jail
