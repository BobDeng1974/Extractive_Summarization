@entity1 gets hay fever - like symptoms , including itchy eyes and a bunged up nose whenever he cuts hair the problem started two years ago when mr @entity1 gave up his labouring job and moved to @entity29 to re-train as a stylist			1
shortly into his training he started suffering hay fever - like symptoms - and baffled doctors eventually diagnosed an allergy to human hair			1

' i left the salon and my sinuses cleared up , my eyes gradually started to ease off			2
' the doctor told me that it was really unusual for a person to have an allergic reaction to human hair as it is usually animal hair or fur which affects people			2
' i 've been prescribed different medicines and remedies but nothing really works			0
' i just try to live with it			0
' and it 's curly locks that seem to be particularly troublesome			0
' i will often have a really bad attack when i have been cutting curly hair			0

his teachers suggested he see a professional but he stumped doctors as they had never heard of someone being allergic to human hair before			0
he assures customers his condition is not contagious and his nose does not drip , although he has to blow his nose every now and again to fight the symptoms .			0
