by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 placed the ball on the spot , smacked it past @entity5 into the top corner and his whoop of delight cut through the leafy tranquility of the @entity11 stockbroker belt where @entity13 train			1
this time last week , @entity2 feared his season might be over , cut short by a twisted ankle during the goalless first leg of the @entity19 semi-final against @entity20			1
on tuesday , he was declared fit by @entity21 , but the manager did not stop there			1
he also told how his captain had unfinished business in this competition and declared his form to be as good as ever			2
legend : @entity2 has been declared fit for the @entity19 semi-final unbreakable : @entity2 returned to training ahead of schedule as @entity13 prepare to face @entity20 leader of the pack : @entity2 has stated that he would like to finish his playing career at @entity40 in return , @entity2 ruled out the notion of an @entity44 return and pledged his future to @entity13 beyond the end of a contract which is about to run out			1
‘ it ’s the club i ’ve been at since 14 , and i ’ve been nowhere else , ’ said the 33 - year - old centre half			2
‘ i want to stay here for the rest of my footballing days			2
‘ we ’ve had big games , so we have n’t spoken for a few weeks , but i hope it gets done			2
it ’s down to the club but i want to stay and i hope something gets sorted out			1
’ he credits @entity21 with reviving a career which was drifting last season , when injuries , suspensions and the tactical preferences of @entity64 combined to leave him a peripheral figure at the club he joined from school			1
‘ a lot of people in football ruled me out a bit last year , thinking i would n’t be here for too much longer , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ that spurs you on to do well and battle for the club you love			2
whether that ’s a year , two years , three years , i feel i have something to give next year			2
beyond that , we do n’t know			0
@entity81 justice ! the @entity13 captain was written off after being dropped by @entity64 in the last campaign fountain of youth ? @entity2 has credited @entity21 ( r ) with reviving his career this season ' the manager has played a massive part for me			1
we spoke in the summer once his deal was done			0
he lets you know straight			0
if you ’re not good enough , you wo n’t play			2
if you ’re playing well , you keep your place			0
’ the feeling is mutual			0
it was @entity21 who brought up @entity2 ’s horrible histories in @entity99 finals — a missed penalty in 2008 in @entity101 , suspension four years later in @entity103 and an injury last year which ruled him out of the @entity106 final in @entity107 — and suggested it was time for the @entity19 to repay him			1
‘ my captain is playing at the same level he was playing when i left @entity13 in 2007 , as simple as that , ’ said @entity21			1
‘ seven years later , he ’s playing again at his best			0
‘ it ’s also fair to say that the people who surround him , the people playing on his left and right , in front of him , are also playing fantastically			0
his partnership with @entity113 is fantastic			0
‘ i ’m really happy to see a player like him , six or seven years later , to be back to the same level			0
he deserves more than the @entity19 has given him up to now			1
potential banana skin ! terry famously slipped as he missed a decisive penalty in the 2008 @entity19 final gatecrasher : @entity127 kept @entity2 out of the 2012 final , although he donned his kit for the celebrations ‘ he lost a few semi-finals in special circumstances			1
he lost a final also in special circumstances			0
he won a final in special circumstances because he could n’t play			2
i think the @entity19 owes him something			1
’ @entity2 , sitting beside his manager , welled up slightly			1
he said for many years he kept the shirt from the @entity101 final on the wall in his home and used it as motivation but it has been in storage since he sold his mansion			0
‘ when we won it i took it down , ’ he said			0
‘ it went into the loft and another one replaced it			0
disappointing memories , but when you go on to win it , happy memories tend to outweigh those			0
’ as for the @entity103 final , in 2012 , when he was ridiculed for pulling on his kit to join in the post-match celebrations , he was also able to laugh			0
‘ it did mean a lot to me that night , playing or not playing , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ i felt i contributed			0
so did other players who did n’t get as much stick as me			0
that ’s a different story			0
man of steel : the 33 - year - old squares up to @entity13 target @entity168 during the first leg in @entity20 in good hands : there were fears @entity2 would not play again this season after limping out of the first game ‘ throughout that campaign , i had surgery on my knee before the @entity179 game and came back really quickly , scored a goal and played a part			1
i did have a big part to play in the dressing room and on the field of play as well			2
‘ those winning moments live with you , those moments when you get your hands on the trophy , particularly when you ’re in a difficult period personally and professionally			0
those memories tend to spur you on			0
’ he underwent intensive treatment through the week to get himself in shape to lead the team out against @entity20 in tonight ’s second leg and is ready to take a penalty if the game goes that way			1
neither of these sides concedes often			0
it will be tense and nervous ; a clash of teams who prefer to be without the ball , anxious not to make the first slip			2
who has the biggest bus ? @entity20 , with @entity13 ’s on - loan goalkeeper @entity210 set to make his debut at @entity40 , have not conceded in six games			1
@entity213 was the last man to beat @entity210 when he equalised for @entity214 in the first leg of the quarter - final on april 1			1
@entity13 have kept five clean sheets out of the last six			2
@entity218 : @entity219 and @entity220 could both return from injury to play a part in the big game in safe hands ? @entity225 returned to training but reserve @entity5 ( @entity228 ) is expected to play on wednesday take a bow : @entity210 is set for an unusual debut at @entity40 ... in goal for the opposition ‘ i hope i can guarantee the home fans a win , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ i ca n’t promise an attractive one			0
the most important thing is to win			0
as a footballer , there ’s no better feeling			0
’ it was no surprise to see the @entity13 players practising from 12 yards but they will be without no 1 goalkeeper @entity225 , despite a game of bluff yesterday			1
@entity225 , who dislocated a shoulder in the first leg last week , trotted out for training , smiling and claiming he was fit , but as he limbered up it soon became clear he was not and he went off to work alone			1
@entity5 will continue in goal , but @entity21 has @entity220 , @entity219 and @entity2 fit after injury .			1

@entity2 is fit to play in @entity13 *'s* @entity19 semi-final
@entity218 captain has stated he wants to stay at the club until end of his career
he credits @entity21 for saving his career after being snubbed by @entity64
