mr @entity64 said : ' our customers are facing huge pressures on their defence budgets and affordability has become an increasing priority			2
' our business needs to rise to this challenge to maintain its competitiveness and ensure its long - term future			1
' but union chief @entity75 branded the decision ' yet another devastating body blow to our manufacturing base '			0
@entity79 of the @entity81 union added that it was a ‘ disgrace ’ that staff had found out about the cuts through media leaks over the weekend rather than from the company			1
@entity16 was known to be planning to axe jobs in the @entity59 as cuts to defence budgets hit sales of the @entity92 combat jet , which is currently in action over @entity94 with the @entity95			1

she said : ' this is high - skilled jobs in @entity31 and @entity29			1

@entity16 has cut jobs across the @entity59 but the greatest losses have been felt at three plants : @entity30 plant ( 899 jobs lost ) - @entity117 ( pictured )			1
there are 900 of these low - cost combat aircraft in use			2
it is the most sucessful training aircraft in the world and is used by the @entity95 and airforces in @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , the @entity127 and @entity128			0
- ' and so you have n't got a whole series of private sector jobs , high - skilled jobs across the @entity130 for people to go into if they lose their jobs at @entity16			1
' so i think the government does really need to respond to this and say what they are going to do about it			0
' @entity140 of the @entity142 union said : ‘ these job losses will be a hammer blow to the @entity59 defence industry , which is already reeling with the consequences of the government ’s ' buy off the shelf ' policy			0
’ he called on the government to offer immediate support to @entity16 to keep its order book strong and avert heavy job losses			0
@entity41 defence spokesman @entity154 said the news was ‘ a real knock for @entity59 manufacturing ’			2
he added : ‘ at a time when it is so hard to find a new job , this is a dreadful moment to lose the one you have			2
‘ the defence industry is vital to the @entity59 , supporting both our forces on the front line and the wider @entity59 economy			0
’ @entity16 has a 33 per cent stake in the @entity92 joint venture company – alongside @entity171 and @entity172 – and has received orders for 550 planes from @entity59 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 , the four partner countries involved in the project			0
the company announced a round of job cuts in january after issuing a £ 410million profits warning			0

in july , @entity16 reported a 12 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to £ 691 million for the six months to the end of june and it predicted that sales would fall again in the second half of the year			0
grounded : @entity16 was known to be planning to axe jobs in the @entity59 as cuts to defence budgets hit sales of the @entity92 combat jet the savage cuts have not just affected @entity16 ’s @entity59 business			2
about half the company ’s sales are in @entity127 , which has also been hit by defence spending cuts			0
@entity16 executives fear there is no end in sight to the squeeze on government defence spending			0
and there is always a chance that some huge orders such as the £ 6billion contract for two aircraft carriers , which are not due to be completed until the end of the decade , could still be cancelled .			0
