it has eluded some of the world 's finest minds for more than a century			1
mathematicians , cryptographers and linguists have all tried and failed to solve the message inside the ' the world 's most mysterious medieval manuscript '			1
the repeated failures to find anything has led many to claim that the so - called @entity14 book is a hoax			1
discovery : a new study has claimed that the @entity14 book - which dates back to the early 1400s - may hold a genuine message mysterious : the book has been dated to the early 1400s , but it largely disappeared from public record until 1912 however , a new study has claimed that the book - which dates back to the early 1400s - may hold a genuine message			1
scientists studying the mysterious text say they have found linguistic patterns which could be meaningful words hidden within the text			1
@entity29 , a theoretical physicist from the @entity30 , says he believes his research - which has been published in the journal @entity33 - could eventually lead to unraveling the mystery of the manuscript			0
strange : mathematicians , cryptographers and linguists have all tried and failed to solve the message inside the manuscript speaking to the @entity41 , dr @entity29 , who has spent years analysing the linguistic patterns within the manuscript , said : ' the text is unique , there are no similar works and all attempts to decode any possible message in the text have failed			1
' it 's not easy to dismiss the manuscript as simple nonsensical gibberish , as it shows a significant [ linguistic ] structure			2
' in an attempt to decode the text , dr @entity29 used a computerised statistical method - an approach known to work on other languages			0
it involved focusing on how the words were arranged			0
despite finding semantic patterns within the manuscript , what the words mean still remain a mystery			2
breakthrough : scientists studying the mysterious text say they have found linguistic patterns which they believe could be meaningful words he admits this still leaves many unanswered questions but insists there must be a story behind the text			1
despite making this breakthrough , many are still unconvinced			0
@entity80 , from @entity81 , says the new findings do not rule out the theory that the manuscript is a hoax			0

it was investigated by a team of code breakers during the @entity98			0
despite being able to discover enemy messages , they were unable to find any meaning in the text .			0

scientists studying the @entity14 book have found linguistic patterns
this could lead to meaningful words being discovered within text
