by @entity0 published : 07:42 est , 25 august 2013 updated : 10:33 est , 25 august 2013 having wanted a piglet her whole life , @entity4 was thrilled to buy what she thought was a micro-pig for her 50th birthday			1
after paying over Â£ 500 for the tiny animal , ms @entity9 from @entity10 , @entity11 , never expected to see it grow bigger than a small dog			1
but three years later , pet pig @entity14 weighs over 20 stone , and measures 5ft 8in from nose to curly tail			1
when mrs @entity4 bought @entity14 she did n't expect him to grow past two stone ms @entity4 and her partner , @entity21 , travelled to @entity22 to pick up @entity14 after a breeder had assured them he was what they were looking for			1
' i 've loved pigs since i was young and always said i was going to get one			0
so when i spotted an advert for micro pigs , i thought that would be perfect , he could live with us like a dog , ' said ms @entity4			2
@entity14 is fully house trained and enjoys cuddling up to watch tv with his owner micro pigs are fully grown at two years old and weigh just two stone			1
so as @entity14 continued to get bigger and bigger , it did n't take long for ms @entity4 to realise she 'd been duped by the breeder			1
' when we picked him up he was about nine weeks old and a bit bigger than i was expecting , but we saw his mother and she was pretty small			0
obviously the dad must have been a lot bigger ! @entity14 as a piglet : after ms @entity4 bought the pig as a 50th birthday treat , she thought he would remain a small size forever			1
but as time went on she began to realise he was n't a micro pig after all ' we thought @entity14 had reached full - size when he got level with the coffee table , but he kept getting bigger			1
' now , he comes up to my waist ! i 'm not sure of his exact weight but he must be at least 20 stone			0
' he 's certainly heavy			0
he stood on my toe the other week and it was black and blue ! ' at first we were shocked by his growth , but we 're used to it now			0
" we did contact the breeder when we realised he was n't ' micro ' but we never got a response			0
' it 's probably just as well because by then we were too attached to part with him			0
@entity14 , who is fully house trained , stays in the house during the day and sleeps in a coal shed in the garden at night , complete with a straw bed and heat lamp			1
once she realised @entity14 was n't a micro pig after all , ms @entity9 contacted the dishonest breeder but received no response @entity78 , the household dog , has been feeling left out as @entity14 attracts so much attention when stood out in the front garden the pampered pig enjoys ' cuddling in and lying in front of the tv '			1
his favourite thing to eat are bananas , but he enjoys scoffing all types of fruit and veg			2
@entity14 has made an unlikely friend in @entity78 , the family 's bichon frise			2
' he 's fully house trained , can give you a trotter when you ask and closes doors behind him			1
though ms @entity4 and her @entity78 are used to her unusual companion , @entity14 still causes quite a stir around town			2
' people think we 're crazy having a huge pig in the house , but everyone who meets @entity14 is smitten			2
despite his surprising growth , @entity14 is part of the family says ms @entity4 ' we used to put him out in the front garden , but we 'd have lines of school buses stopping outside and cars nearly crashing as the drivers were too busy looking at this huge pig running around , ' she laughed			2
' now , he sticks to the back - but we still have people asking if they can meet our pet pig			0
' most have heard he loves bananas and bring a bunch along			0
' the only thing we need to be wary of is shoelaces			0
he likes to chew them so you might end up with him accidentally nibbling your leg			0
' but other than that he 's a big friendly giant			0

owners thought pet piglet would n't grow bigger than two stone
@entity14 is 5ft 8in from head to tail and is only three
house trained pet enjoys watching tv and eating bananas
