@entity1 governor @entity0 announced today his intentions to deploy up to 1,000 @entity4 troops to his state 's southern border , which is also the @entity7 border with @entity8			1
' there can be no national security without border security , and @entity13 have paid too high a price for the federal government ’s failure to secure our border , ' the @entity9 governor said at a news conference this afternoon			1
' the action i am ordering today will tackle this crisis head - on by multiplying our efforts to combat the cartel activity , human traffickers and individual criminals who threaten the safety of people across @entity1 and @entity7			2
' according to a memo leaked late last night to the monitor , the executive action will cost @entity1 taxpayers $ 12 million a month			1
added together , the two measures will cost $ 5 million a week , the memo reportedly states , and ' it is not clear where the money will come from in the budget ' other than ' non critical ' areas like health care or transportation			1
the rise in border protection measures follows a surge of @entity55 children streaming into the @entity7 from @entity8			0
more than 57,000 immigrant children , many of whom are unaccompanied , have illegally entered the country since last year , and the government estimates that approximately 90,000 will arrive by the close of this year			0
@entity7 @entity62 has been overloaded by the deluge , and the federal government is quickly running out of money to care for the children			0
@entity67 is in the process of reviewing a $ 3.7 billion emergency funding request from president @entity70 that would appropriate additional money to the agencies involved , but @entity73 @entity9 remain skeptical of the president 's plan			1
roughly half of the money @entity70 's asking for would go toward providing humanitarian aid to the children while relatively little would go toward returning the them to their home countries			2
furthermore , @entity9 would like to see changes to a 2008 trafficking law that requires the government to give children from non-contiguous countries who show up at the border health screenings and due process before they can be sent home			1
the judicial process often takes months , and even years , clogging up courts and slowing down the repatriation process			0
the president had initially planned to include a revised version of the 2008 legislation in his request to @entity67 that would have allowed the @entity98 to exercise the ' discretion ' to bypass the current process by giving children the option to voluntarily return home			0
@entity70 backed down at the last minute after receiving negative feedback from @entity106 lawmakers			2
@entity0 held a news conference with attorney general @entity108 , right , this afternoon in @entity109 , @entity1 , to formally announce the deployment			1
@entity0 said the @entity112 troops were needed to combat criminals that are exploiting a surge of children and families entering the @entity7 illegally also not included in @entity70 's request to @entity67 was funding for a @entity112 deployment to the border - something house speaker @entity120 and the @entity1 governor had both called on the president to do			1
@entity9 say a @entity112 presence is needed at areas of high crime to help @entity62 agents crack down on smugglers and drug cartels			2
in a face to face meeting with @entity70 when the president came to @entity1 two weeks ago @entity0 again asked the president to deploy the @entity4 through a federally funded statue but @entity70 resisted			1
@entity0 is now taking matters into his own hands , sending his own set of troops down to the @entity136 to aid law enforcement officials			1
state senator @entity138 , a @entity139 who represents border town @entity140 , criticized the @entity9 governor 's deployment as unnecessary			1
' [ the cartels ] are taking advantage of the situation , ' he told the monitor			0
' but our local law enforcement from the sheriff ’s offices of the different counties to the different police departments are taking care of the situation			0
' this is a civil matter , not a military matter			0
what we need is more resources to hire more deputies , hire more @entity62 , ' @entity138 said			0
' these are young people , just families coming across			0
they 're not carrying weapons			0
' the leaked memo on the @entity112 deployment specifically denies that it is a ' militarization of the border , ' however			1
and @entity0 's office reiterated today that troops would ' work seamlessly and side by side with law enforcement officials			2
' @entity138 also accused @entity0 , who recently toured the border with @entity171 as part of a special for @entity173 , of being insincere in his concern about the situation at the border			2
' all these politicians coming down to border , they do n't care about solving the problem , they just want to make a political point , ' he said .			0

@entity1 governor @entity0 announced this afternoon that he will dispatch up to 1,000 @entity4 troops to the border
the deployment will cost @entity1 taxpayers $ 12 million a month , according to a leaked memo
@entity0 has asked @entity70 multiple times to send the @entity4 to the border but @entity70 keeps refusing
a @entity1 lawmaker said the @entity9 governor is not sincerely concerned about the border , he just wants to play politics
