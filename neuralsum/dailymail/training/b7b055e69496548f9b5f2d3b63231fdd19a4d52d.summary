there can be few more startling examples of gentrification than @entity4 ’s @entity3			1
in 1900 it was home to 250 abattoirs and packing plants – hence the name – in the 1980s it was a magnet for drug dealers and the @entity11 – and now it ’s one of the trendiest areas anywhere in the world , frequented by fashionistas , cocktail scenesters and more hipsters than you can shake a mojito at , not to mention handfuls of @entity23 ’s celebrity population			1
they are drawn to high - end boutiques like @entity26 , dining hot - spots such as @entity28 and the hotel i ’m staying at – the @entity31			1
hot spot : the @entity31 is in the heart of the trendy @entity3 district it opened in 2004 , with the likes of the @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 all having checked in there since			1
i may not be a celebrity , but the staff there still treat you like one			1
okay , they do n’t ask for my autograph , but @entity49 , my travelling companion , and i are treated with the utmost courtesy by the staff behind the reception desk and the bell boy gives us an enthusiastic tour of our ‘ deluxe ’ roost			1
cynics might say he ’s angling for a big tip , but he seems sincere to me			1
in the room , my eye is immediately caught by a substantial - looking boom box , which connects to your phone and any playlists you have on it via @entity69			1
further exploration reveals a mini-bar fit for a pop star , with @entity74 vodka and @entity76 champagne			1
the beds , meanwhile , are seriously sizeable , and look incredibly comfortable			1
i throw myself onto mine			1
it is indeed worthy of the ‘ deluxe ’ nomenclature			1
the hotel ’s website boasts that the linen is 400 - thread @entity86 cotton , which i ’m assuming is a mark of quality , judging by how tremendous they are to lie on			1
comfort zone : the @entity31 's bedrooms are spacious , stylish and luxurious the headboards above them are a striking pink , which some might not find relaxing , but with the lights out , who cares ? the bathroom is large , marbly , spotless , and festooned with luxe @entity100 washing products			2
half the space is covered by mirrors – i would n’t expect anything less given the hotel ’s paparazzi - baiting clientele			1
there ’s acres of space in the room , so you can really spread out			2
most hotels of note like to throw some art on the walls , and the @entity31 is no different			2
we have a photograph of a woman with long hair , plus a photograph of a man and woman moving in for a kiss that ’s presented in two separate frames			2
not to my taste , but a hat tip to the hotel for making the effort			2
all in all it ’s a seductive environment – contemporary , a bit flash , but comfortable and welcoming			1
a good place to get your bearings at the @entity31 is to ascend to the rooftop bar where you ’ll find a big swimming pool and superb views over the @entity3			2
refreshing : a dip in the @entity3 rooftop pool is a great way to start the day size matters : @entity145 languishes in one of the huge poolside chairs i sip a cold sauvignon blanc and cast an eye over the neighbourhood			2
right opposite is the lauded @entity28 restaurant , a bit further beyond that is the revered @entity154 – a disused elevated railway that ’s been transformed into a hipster ’s nature reserve with pop - up bars and ice - cream stalls – and straight down below are the deeply uneven cobbled streets that swarms of taxis bounce along day and night			1
the fact that achingly fashionable media members club @entity164 opened its @entity4 branch here – just yards to the north - east , says it all			1
it ’s a buzz zone that ’s taken root			2
much of the character of the @entity3 is expressed in one fell swoop by the lobby			2
it ’s expansive , airy , modern – and there ’s a pool table			1
trendy , but not uptight			2
it ’s catwalk hipster every step of the way			0
the very cool @entity180 is the focal point , though			0
i recommend the @entity184 , @entity185 , chardonnay they serve , but apparently the most popular tipple is a cocktail called ‘ @entity189 ’ – made with @entity190 , pomegranate syrup and lime juice			1
the outdoor section of the hotel ’s restaurant , the @entity193 , meanwhile , is a superb place to not only dine on thoroughly decent fodder , but to soak up the vibrant @entity3 atmosphere			0
options include prime juicy steak , campanelle pasta tossed with mushrooms and broccoli and @entity206 salmon topped with bourbon glaze			0
it ’s uncomplicated fare , cooked well , and always whisked out from the kitchen with friendly efficiency			0
high life : a good place to get your bearings at the @entity31 is to ascend to the rooftop bar looking down from the @entity31 to the @entity3			0
the @entity154 walk can be seen top right mother @entity219 enjoying a stroll along the @entity154 , which is just a few minutes ' walk from the @entity31 any hotel setting up shop in @entity3 needs to have measures in place to shield its residents from the sounds of nighttime revelry			0
@entity4 in general is noisy , but this district harbours a cluster of hotspots open till the early hours			0
the beds prove to be monumentally comfortable , while solid double glazing tempers the sounds of the night right down			0
however , booking in here comes with the caveat that if you ’re a very light sleeper , you may not get the most restful night			0
i ’m stirred a couple of times by excitable hollering from the bar opposite our fourth - floor room – called catch - but only briefly			1
i find that i like the hotel best in the morning			0
we establish a glorious routine of going for a swim in the rooftop pool and lounging in the brilliant oversized wicker chairs as the sunlight reaches out to us across the skyline			0
then it ’s downstairs for coffee , juice and eggs benedict outside at the @entity193 to watch @entity259 come to life			0
i ’m sad to say goodbye to the @entity31			0
it ’s a hotel that has cleverly alchemised swagger , style and luxury with a welcoming atmosphere			0
no wonder the celebrities risk breaking their heels on @entity3 ’s cobbles to stay here			0
rooms at @entity31 start at $ 425 per night			0
visit www.gansevoorthotelgroup.com or phone ( 001 ) 877 - 426 - 7386 for reservations			0
@entity272 and @entity273 have up to four daily flights to @entity4 via their @entity276 and @entity277 hubs			0
prices start at £ 389 from 18 departure points in the @entity280 and @entity281			0
book online at www.klm.com and @entity283			0
