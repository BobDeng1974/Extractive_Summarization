@entity0 has hit back at @entity1 following the former @entity4 midfielder ’s criticism of @entity5			1
@entity6 legend @entity1 has accused the £ 42.5million man of ‘ going through the motions ’ during his time with the @entity10 in comments made to a national newspaper			1
but the @entity14 manager has defended his record signing , saying : ‘ it ’s a wrong statement			1
he works very hard and he ’s a great player			2
a player like @entity1 would have loved to play with @entity5			1
@entity5 has a point to prove and he knows that			1
@entity1 hit out at @entity20 playmaker @entity5 by insisting he took easy option when he joined @entity14 @entity22 has scored four goals during the course of the current campaign @entity14 boss @entity0 has leaped to @entity5 's defence by hitting back at former @entity6 ace @entity1 ‘ i believe he has the quality , he puts a lot of effort in to help the team and he works much harder than his style shows			1
‘ you can be cheated a little bit by his style of play , because he is fluid , easy , subtle and he does not look like he puts the effort in , but he does			2
’ meanwhile , @entity0 has launched a staunch defence of summer signing @entity39 as the forward prepares for his @entity6 return			1
after arriving at the @entity45 intent on playing as a central striker , the @entity4 international has found himself playing out wide again , a position he found frustrating during his time at @entity50			2
he has scored seven goals since arriving from @entity6 in august — three of those coming in a @entity53 win over @entity54			2
but ahead of monday ’s @entity56 quarter - final , @entity0 insists @entity39 has not been a £ 16million flop			1
@entity0 and @entity5 in training at @entity59 ahead of their @entity56 clash against @entity6 @entity5 has divided opinion among @entity14 fans and the wider public since arriving in @entity4 @entity0 also defended former @entity6 striker @entity39 's impact at @entity14 ‘ he ’s very important and has played many games since the start of the season , ’ said @entity0 — who confirmed central defender @entity65 will miss up to three weeks with a hamstring injury			1
‘ if you check the statistics you will see ( the suggestion @entity39 does n’t play often ) is wrong			2
he ’s one of the players who has played the most games for us , but not in the last couple of games			2
@entity0 also spoke to @entity79 ’s @entity78 in an interview for the @entity82 ’s @entity81 , to be broadcast on saturday			1
in it , the @entity14 manager , who has won the @entity56 five times , discussed his favourite memories of the competition and which of the wins meant most to him			1
@entity0 said : ‘ maybe the first one against @entity89 was the best because it was when we won the double in 1998			1
i remember absolutely everything about that day because it was at @entity95			2
when i was a kid in @entity96 i saw the cup finals			2
for me to come from a little village and go for the first time to @entity95 was something special			0
it was a great old stadium , the soul was there , the grass was special			0
’ @entity1 believes the likes of @entity6 's @entity106 left @entity14 because they were ambitious the likes of @entity108 and @entity109 also left @entity14 to add to their personal trophy collection but when asked about his collection of medals , @entity0 admitted he cared little for them			1
he said : ‘ i do n’t even know where they are			0
maybe i will regret it			0
i would like to think i get more out of the human side of my career			0
‘ i prefer to have a box of memories than a box of medals			0
what is interesting is that you can have an influence on people ’s lives			0
they can have a big influence on you as well			0
’ @entity14 face @entity6 on monday and @entity0 enjoyed many classic cup ties against sir @entity133 ’s side , but he said the pair ’s frosty relationship had thawed in recent years			1
‘ i am happy to see him now , ’ said @entity0 , ‘ more than before because we have gone through some different periods			1
in the end it became more respectful and of course he was not always objective in defending his team			0
nor was i ! that created disagreements			0
‘ now we are happy to have dinner together and a good glass of wine and rise above the differences			0
’ but monday ’s tie does n’t please him			0
‘ i wanted to play at home			0
but fantastic game or not , what is important is that you go through			0
it would have been better at home			0
now it is what it is , you want to qualify for the semi-final			0
