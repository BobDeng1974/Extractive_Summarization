by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 for @entity1 and @entity3 the @entity6 ' @entity5 nightmare has worsened after basketball 's governing body opened an investigation into the controversial loss to @entity11 in which @entity12 was accused of tanking			1
a day after a surprise defeat to @entity14 sent them out of the tournament in @entity17 , @entity12 learned they could face disciplinary action from @entity20 over the manner of last week 's loss to @entity11			1
the boomers rested several key players and let a 15 - point lead slip in the third quarter against @entity28 's no.1 nation in their final group game in @entity30 to go down by 91 - 83			1
the 91 - 83 loss meant @entity12 could not face the all - conquering @entity33 team until the semi-finals but boomers head coach @entity35 rejected suggestions they lost on purpose			1
the alleged strategy proved irrelevant after a 65 - 64 loss to @entity14 in their sudden - death round of 16 game on sunday , but @entity44 must now formally defend the performance against @entity11 or face possible sanctions such as a fine			1
' it is widely suspected that @entity12 lost that game in order to avoid having to face the reigning world champions @entity33 until the semi-finals			1
' @entity44 has an opportunity to state its case before @entity20 decides whether and to what extent disciplinary sanctions shall be imposed			0
' @entity76 @entity75 star @entity74 was among the fiercest critics of @entity12 's performance , taking to @entity79 after the match to urge @entity20 to take action			1
' basketball is a beautiful sport , there is no room for fixing the game like today @entity12 vs @entity11 ! ! @ @entity20 should do something about that ! ' he posted			1
with a place in the knockout stages already secured , @entity35 rested his two best performing players of the tournament , star centre @entity93 and sharp - shooting veteran @entity94 , while giving fellow starters @entity95 and @entity97 less than four minutes each			2
when challenged post-match on whether his side had contested the match in the spirit of the game , @entity35 was defiant , arguing the heavy tournament schedule demanded he rest his players before the next stage of competition			2
' we always , as @entity12 , compete the right way , ' he said			0
pressed on how some people would view the loss @entity35 said : ' people will make up their own minds			2
' there 's always going to be speculators			0
i ca n't control what people think			0
' injured @entity12 star @entity118 hit out at @entity20 's comments and questioned the governing body 's consistency			1
' so u can naturalize a plyer who has nver stepped foot in a country , but you cant rest players in a game 2 better a draw 4 youself ? ok @ fiba , ' @entity118 wrote on @entity79			0

' jubilant @entity11 supporters enjoy the eight point win in the game against @entity12 a dejected @entity12 bench watch on as the side comes to terms with losing @entity12 were in contention to run away with the game when they led by 15 in the third quarter despite missing their two best players , @entity75 stars @entity150 and @entity118 , @entity12 had been optimistic of challenging for a first ever @entity5 medal			1
the boomers were on course for their first quarter - final appearance in 20 years , leading @entity14 by six points with just over a minute to play in @entity156 on sunday night			1
however , some poor decision - making allowed @entity14 back into the game and @entity159 buried a three - pointer with five seconds remaining to give the reigning silver medallists a famous win			1
@entity44 is yet to make comment on @entity20 's investigation			2
@entity35 said suggestions of tanking were ridiculous and defended @entity12 as a nation that competes in the interest of fair play			2
' we always , as @entity12 , compete the right way , ' he said			0
when asked whether he accepted that some @entity12 would view the loss with an air of scepticism , @entity35 said : ' people will make up their own minds			1
' ' there 's always going to be speculators			0
i ca n't control what people think			0
' the boomers were chasing a fourth straight victory for the first time in @entity5 history , and for most of the match were cruising before the wheels fell off			1
guard @entity188 shot a team - high 22 points as the @entity6 opened up a 15 - point buffer			1
it was also an opportunity to see highly - rated @entity75 draft pick @entity193 in action , and the 19 - year - old did n't disappoint - scoring 12 points and handing out six assists in his 31 minutes on court			0
despite fielding a second string team @entity12 was still the heavily backed favourites at $ 1.17 @entity12 's @entity193 takes on @entity11 's @entity202 and @entity203 @entity12 's forward @entity49 shoots from the free foul line @entity12 was winning by 15 in the third quarter when the momentum swung in @entity11 's favour the loss means @entity12 will not have to face the @entity33 until the semi finals if they win their way there but an @entity11 charge , led by dynamic young star @entity214 's outstanding 38 - point display , started midway through the third quarter and they cut the lead to just two at the final break			1
the onslaught continued thereafter as @entity12 carelessly gave up the ball , committing 18 turnovers , and played lacklustre defence as the clock wound down in the eight - point loss - prompting the tanking calls			1
sports betting agency @entity226 refunded $ 125,500 in bets placed on the boomers to win the match in light of the allegations			2
the side was an unbackable $ 1.17 to win with @entity11 the $ 5.20 outsiders			2
' punters bet on the @entity12 in good faith not knowing they would be resting a few of their guns and giving their reserves a go , so we think it 's only fair that they get their money back to enjoy over the weekend , ' the agency 's @entity234 said			2

( the loss ) does n't guarantee us third spot he said the team had ' no control over that game			2
' ' that was always the case coming in			0
' securing third spot would mean @entity12 would avoid a quarter - final show down against @entity33 and conveniently put them in a position to challenge for a maiden medal at the tournament			1
