' but we can put that car there and let it sit all day and it will slow people down			0

an @entity2 police department is using a *plastic* @entity103 dummy to catch drivers speeding
' @entity4 ' is set up in a police car to *scare* drivers into slowing down
although the town 's drivers are aware a dummy is being used , they never know whether it 's a real cop or not
he 's got many fans in town who take selfies when they find him and post them to his @entity39 page
the town 's police chief says they could n't afford to have more officers watching for speeding which is when the idea for @entity4 struck
