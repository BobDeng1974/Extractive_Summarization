on the video uploaded to @entity15 , the woman can be seen trying to protect herself by putting up her hands but she does not appear to resist the trooper			1
' the most animalistic , most brutal way to subdue someone is to pound someone 's head into the concrete with really big blows to the head , ' witness @entity17 told @entity24			2
' he starts really letting loose ... he starts pounding down on her face really hard			0
he does n't try to grab her hands first			0
' the video captured on @entity17 's cell phone shows him slowing down for a traffic stop as a woman can be seen heading towards the median on the freeway			1

eventually another man - later identified by the @entity9 as a plain clothes officer - approaches the trooper and helps handcuff the woman			1
attack : the motorist said he saw the trooper hit her as many as 15 times with hard blows to the head speaking to @entity24 , the @entity9 said the officer had ordered the woman to stop walking but she ignored him and fearing she would be hurt , the officer tried placing her under arrest			1
' a physical altercation ensued as the pedestrian continued to resist arrest , at which point a plain clothes , off duty officer assisted in applying the handcuffs , ' the @entity9 said in the statement			2
the @entity9 added that the woman refused to give her name and she was booked as ' @entity75 ' and taken to a local hospital for mental and physical evaluation			2
