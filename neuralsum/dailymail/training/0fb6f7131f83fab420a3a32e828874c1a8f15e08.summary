@entity1 defender @entity0 is adamant @entity4 's @entity3 revolution will soon see his side back at their entertaining best			1
@entity4 's tactics have come under fire from some @entity1 fans who are keen to see him revert back to the tried - and - tested 4 - 4 - 2 formation			1
and @entity1 midfielder @entity12 admitted this week that @entity4 's system often made it ' more difficult for me to play '			1
@entity0 believes the @entity1 first team will soon be at their entertaining best @entity4 's side are now the highest ranked team left in the @entity18 but @entity4 's resolute defence of his methods is starting to pay dividends , with the club up to third in the @entity24 and @entity18 favourites after wednesday night 's fourth - round replay win over @entity26			1
@entity0 said : ' i think when you get as many attacking players on the pitch as we 've got you are always going to entertain			2
' but the manager has done a lot of work in trying to steady the team and making sure everyone knows their jobs			0
once we get that nailed on , and everyone knows their defensive jobs , then i think we 'll be able to push on from that and be really entertaining again			0
' you can look at the formation changes and the personnel changes as well , plus the fact that there 's a lot of players who have n't played together before , and he [ the manager ] is doing fantastically well in getting us organised			2
and as players we 're really benefiting from that			0
' @entity1 midfielder @entity12 admitted this week that @entity4 's system often made it ' more difficult for me to play ' @entity0 , who made his @entity1 debut in 2007 , insists it is inevitable the squad will take time to fully adapt to @entity4 's methods following the departure of sir @entity60 and the tumult of @entity63 ' brief and unsuccessful regime			1
' i think the lads have taken a lot on board , ' added @entity0			2
' at times it has been tough and it takes time			0
we 've been used to playing a certain way for a number of years , then the change happens and he wants us to play a certain way			0
' so it does take time for those things to become second nature			0
but i think you are starting to see that now			0
' shock defeats for @entity81 and @entity82 have left @entity1 as the highest - ranked team left in the @entity18 @entity84 and @entity85 both scored in the first half as @entity1 sealed their place in the fifth round with a 3 - 0 win against @entity90 @entity1 may have limped past lowly @entity26 at the second attempt but @entity0 thinks it could spell the start of the club 's first @entity18 triumph since 2004			1
shock defeats for @entity81 and @entity82 have left @entity1 as the highest - ranked team left in the competition , giving @entity4 a superb chance of capping his first season in charge with a major trophy			1
@entity0 said : ' our record in the @entity18 has n't been good over the last few years			2
' it 's an old cliche that you want to win everything but it is such a historic trophy , especially for @entity1 , and the fact that the league is still not gone but not looking likely , the @entity18 looks our best chance of a trophy , especially considering some of the teams that have gone out			1
' we 're the highest ranked team left in the competition now			0
it was a bit of a shock sitting at home hearing the news that @entity81 and @entity82 had gone out			2
but we know from our own experiences all about upsets			0

@entity0 believes @entity1 are starting to click under @entity4
the @entity1 defender is *confident* his side can *collect* the @entity18 after @entity82 and @entity81 's shock exits
red *devils* are through to the @entity18 fifth round after 3 - 0 win against @entity90
