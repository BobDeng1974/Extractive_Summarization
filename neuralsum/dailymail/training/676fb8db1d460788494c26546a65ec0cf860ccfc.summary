by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:56 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 03:02 est , 17 july 2013 children 's academic ability could be tested as soon as they start primary school aged four or five under plans unveiled by @entity6			1
pupils are currently tested at seven to set a ‘ baseline ’ for measuring their progress in school			1
but details of plans to do this during reception year emerged in a consultation document launched by the deputy prime minister , which also includes plans to rank primary school pupils against their peers across the country			1
pupils could also be ranked against their peers across the country , being put in achievement ' bands ' this would see primaries having to ensure 85 per cent of pupils are ready for senior school or risk triggering an @entity31 inspection			1
pupils could also be ranked against their peers across the country , being put in 10 per cent achievement ‘ bands ’ , showing , for example , if they are in the top 10 per cent			1
the consultation document contains a reference to a ‘ new benchmark ’ to assess ‘ progress that has been made by 11 - year - olds ’			1
it says the ‘ baseline ’ test ‘ could be at age seven , as now , where teachers assess pupils ; or a simple check of a child ’s ability in the early weeks of a child ’s career at school ’			1
schools that fail to increase this to 85 per cent by 2016 under the measures outlined by mr @entity6 could be judged to be under - performing @entity6 said today : ' all we ’re saying is it ca n’t surely be right that under the current standards a school is deemed to be doing okay if four out of ten of the children who leave primary school are judged not to be ready to have a good start at secondary school			1
' this is not to try and either humiliate or celebrate , it ’s to give teachers and parents an idea of how that child measures up to other children in the school system			1
that ’s all it is			0
' i saw some comments from teaching unions this morning that somehow this was a lurch back to a name - and - shame approach , it ’s not at all			0
' so it ’s higher standards , more money , and the aspiration , the hope is simply to make sure everybody gets the best possible start in life			0
' a source close to mr @entity6 added last night : ‘ we are going to have new tests at 11 and we need to have a new baseline			1
‘ we are open - minded about whether you do it at seven or even earlier			0
it would be a teacher - led assessment			0
’ @entity31 chief sir @entity99 suggested last month that children should be tested in basic language and literacy even before they start formal education			0
he warned testing pupils at the end of their reception year was already too late , adding : ‘ children may have lost a vital year of learning by then			1
’ currently just 60 per cent of 11 - year - olds in a school are required to reach @entity111 4 in maths and @entity114 @entity113 – the standard expected of their age group			1
schools that fail to increase this to 85 per cent by 2016 under the measures outlined by mr @entity6 yesterday could be judged to be under - performing			1
they could be taken over and turned into academies			0
the current marking system will also be axed , although its replacement has not been confirmed			0
the point at which children are judged to be on track to start secondary school will also be raised			2
at present , achieving @entity129 – the bottom third of the level 4 pass range – is considered acceptable			0
yet just 47 per cent of these children go on to get five good gcses , including maths and @entity114			2
mr @entity6 confirmed the pupil premium – extra funding for disadvantaged pupils – is to increase from £ 900 to £ 1,300 in primary schools from next year to help improve standards			1
around one in seven pupils qualify for the financial support			2
critics have previously voiced concerns about pupils spending too much time preparing for tests instead of learning at school			1
after taking national tests at seven , they sit more @entity113 in maths , @entity114 and science when they are 11			2
some take their first gcses the following year and complete them when they are 16 , making four sets of exams in ten years			2
as - levels and a-levels bring the total to six in 12 years			0
mr @entity6 ’s planned test would make it seven in 12 years			2
@entity160 , general secretary of the @entity161 , said : ‘ the problems with the tests at the end of primary school are well documented			0
‘ most secondary schools re-test pupils at the start of @entity169 because they do n’t trust the accuracy of data they have to work with			0
‘ a fairer , more accurate way of measuring pupils ’ ability at the end of primary school is certainly needed			2
‘ i am not convinced ranking 11 - year - olds will help to raise standards			2
i worry what will happen to those children who have tried hard yet are told they are in one of the bottom bands			0
‘ children at that age mature differently and their confidence can be easily damaged			0
it could make secondary teachers ’ job in building self - esteem and confidence even more difficult			0
’ @entity194 , general secretary of the teachers ’ union @entity196 , said : ‘ school level assessments are fine in principle but in the context of current high - stakes accountability , with no framework for support or provision of resources , the outcome is likely be a bureaucratic nightmare for teachers			0
