from 250 to 271 ad up to 5,000 people died each day in @entity1 not from war and famine , but from a deadly pandemic that would later be known as the @entity5			1
and now archaeologists have found the remains of what appears to be victims of the widespread disease , in a pit in @entity12 , @entity13			1
kilns used to produce lime to cover the victims were also found , alongside a bonfire where stricken people were burned in order to stop the spread of the highly infectious disease , dubbed the ' end of worlds ' pandemic			1
archaeologists in @entity13 have found the remains of victims that were struck down by the plague pf @entity28 in the latter half of the 3rd century			1
the victims were burned and covered in lime to prevent the deadly disease from spreading			1
here can be seen two skulls , two bricks and a jug at the burial site the find was made by the @entity38 to @entity12 ( @entity40 ) team , reported @entity41			1
@entity42 was an ancient disease caused by the variola virus that resulted in a nasty rash where lesions were filled with fluid and pus			1
the highly contagious disease was fatal in up to 30 per cent of cases			2
it spread through contact between people and saliva droplets in an infected person 's breath			2
more than 300 million people died from smallpox in the 20th century alone			1
but vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries ultimately led to its eradication in 1979			0
it is one of only two infectious diseases to have been completely destroyed , the other being rinderpest in 2011			0
the eradication of smallpox is regarded as one of humanity 's greatest accomplishments			0
source : @entity73 the team , led by @entity75 , excavated the tomb , known as the @entity77 of @entity78 and @entity79 , from 1997 until 2012			0
the monument had been built for an @entity13 grand steward named @entity78 in the 7th century @entity82 and it was continually used until it became a plague - burial site in the @entity84 - and was then never used again			1
writing in the @entity85 , @entity75 said using the tomb to dispose of infected corpses ‘ gave the monument a lasting bad reputation and doomed it to centuries of oblivion until tomb robbers entered the complex in the early 19th century			2
’ the @entity5 raged until 271 , by which time it claimed a quarter of @entity1 ’s population - and countless lives elsewhere			2
it spread across what is now modern - day @entity99 and into @entity100			2
now believed to have been caused by smallpox , the plague was so devastating that it led the bishop of @entity104 at the time , @entity28 for whom the pandemic is named , to lament that it could signal the ‘ passing away of the world ’			1
the find was made at a funerary complex , or tomb , in @entity12 , @entity13			1
in the time of the @entity113 this city was known as @entity114 and , from 250 to 271 ad it , like many other regions , was ravaged by smallpox in a pandemic that is now called the @entity5 the kilns to produce lime to cover the bodies were fuelled by the remains of old wooden coffins , such as the one shown here			1
the find was made by the @entity38 to @entity12 ( @entity40 ) team after 15 years of excavations from 1997 to 2012 oil lamps discovered near the lime kilns , shown here , were used by the stokers who kept the kilns burning to see in the dark			2
@entity133 would have had to keep the kilns burning around the clock for several days in order to produce the lime necessary to cover the bodies of the plague , @entity28 explained the rather gruesome ways it would ravage its victims in his essay @entity144 ( on the plague )			2
' the intestines are shaken with a continual vomiting ’ and ‘ the eyes are on fire with the ejected blood , ’ it read			0
in some cases victims would also lose limbs to the disease , while many also eventually died			0
the remarkable artefacts found by the archaeologists show the level of fear and panic the plague induced in the locals			0
this best disinfectant known at the time was lime , which involved heating limestone to huge temperatures of up to 1,000 ° @entity168 )			0
the large temperatures , though , required huge amounts of fuel , and in order to produce enough lime to cover all the bodies it seems the locals at the time used coffins , and other artefacts , they found in this tomb to burn			2
bodies were covered with a layer of lime , used as a disinfectant , and kept inside a pillared hallway shown at 1			0
the three kilns are shown at @entity188 , in part fuelled by both coffin and mummy remains stored at 4			0
water was added to the lime at niche 3 , while the bonfire to burn the bodies is at 2 here can be seen a close - up view of lime kiln c , which has a double chamber			0
it was built along with the other two kilns in order to produce enough lime disinfectant to cover the multitude of human remains that had died in the plague that struck the ancient city of @entity114 , now @entity12 seen here is the location where bodies were stored on the northern aisle of the monument 's first pillared hall and covered with lime			1
the @entity5 raged until 2071 , by which time it claimed a quarter of @entity1 's population at the time of the outbreak , it was said people were quick to turn over their friends and even family to the authorities in the hope they could avoid the deadly plague themselves			1
the streets were strewn with carcasses , many of which were burned to try and destroy the disease			0
in 270 the pandemic claimed the life of emperor @entity231 and is thought by some to have contributed to the eventual @entity232			0
there are many other incidents of smallpox breaking out around the world through human history , until the deadly disease was eradicated in 1979 after a widespread vaccination campaign			1
this area was used to ' slake ' , or add water to , the lime			0
the lime production capabilities show just how fearful the locals were of the disease			0
now believed to have been caused by smallpox , the plague was so devastating that it led @entity28 to lament that it could signal the ' passing away of the world ' before becoming a burial chamber for those killed by the @entity5 , the funerary had been built for an @entity13 grand steward named @entity78 in the 7th century @entity82 shown here is a grey fragment of decoration from within the monument found inside of the lime kilns it seems when it came to disposing of the plague victims the 3rd century @entity13 did not hold back in desecrating previous burials and tombs in their panic			1
here is seen the face of a second century coffin that was stored as fuel in the entrance of the monument			0

@entity272 archaeologists have revealed an ancient burial plot in @entity12 , @entity13
the 3rd century tomb was used to stop the deadly spread of a pandemic
the @entity279 killed 5,000 people a day at its peak from 250 to 271 ad
the disease was believed to be smallpox , which was eradicated in 1979
at the time , @entity28 said it could signal the ' passing away of the world '
