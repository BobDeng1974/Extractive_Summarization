sir @entity20 , interception of communications commissioner , is to require all police forces to reveal the extent of their use of the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) against journalists			1
sir @entity20 said he shared the concerns about protecting sources			1
the @entity12 will look at police use of @entity27 in relation to journalists as part of a wider review of the powers available under the @entity38 to the police and @entity40 which was announced earlier this year			2
since then , two police forces have been found using the powers to obtain journalists ’ phone records and work out who they were speaking to			2
a @entity12 source said last night : ‘ the last thing we want is for @entity27 to be used to circumvent laws protecting journalists ’ sources or undermining journalistic methods and practices			0
’ last month it emerged that the @entity55 used @entity27 powers to obtain telephone records from @entity60 newspaper ’s newsdesk and those of its political editor , @entity62 as part of the @entity65 inquiry			2
the records were used to uncover who told the newspaper about claims @entity69 , the then chief whip , described officers as ‘ plebs ’ after they refused to allow him to cycle through the gates of @entity76			1
then , last week , it emerged police investigating the @entity79 speeding points scandal secretly obtained the phone records of journalist on the @entity83 – the @entity89 ’s sister paper - and one of his sources for the story , even though a judge had agreed that the source could remain confidential			1
@entity91 also used @entity27 to find out who spoke to @entity93 , the mail on sunday news editor working on the story , and his source , freelance journalist @entity97 , who was given the story by @entity100			0
the former judge was arrested after police discovered she lied to officers by claiming she had not discussed the case with any reporters			0
the @entity107 media commentator @entity106 has likened officers ’ actions in such cases to those of a ‘ police state ’			0
@entity27 requires only that the request be approved by a police officer of superintendent rank or above – effectively giving forces the right to sign off their own warrants			0
announcing his inquiry , sir @entity20 said : ‘ i fully understand and share the concerns raised about the protection of journalistic sources so as to enable a free press			1
’ he has been deluged with more than 1,000 complaints since details of @entity137 ’s actions in relation to @entity60 became public			0
the ' @entity27 ' powers enable police forces and other public authorities to obtain telephone data without judicial approval and were used in the @entity65 affair involving former @entity145 chief whip @entity69 ( above ) @entity137 used snooping powers – contained in the @entity27 act – to obtain a @entity60 journalist @entity62 's phone records to uncover a whistleblower in the @entity65 affair he said his office would report all findings to the prime minister , and publicly , to develop ‘ clarity in relation to the scope and compliance of this activity ’			1
the @entity60 made an official complaint about the @entity55 ’s actions , and has called for a public hearing at the @entity163 into the way the @entity55 accessed its journalists ’ records			0
the newspaper ’s managing editor @entity167 said the use of @entity27 posed a ‘ really serious risk to the @entity171 ’			0
he told @entity172 ’s @entity173 : ‘ if you are going to seek to access information about journalists ’ sources you should be doing it in front of a judge , where the publisher or the broadcaster or the journalist themselves can make an argument and be aware of what is going on			0
