by @entity0 published : 07:42 est , 3 may 2012 updated : 10:18 est , 3 may 2012 the @entity2 's website was temporarily shut down today after a cyber attack			1
it was the victim of a scam known as distributed denial of service ( @entity6 ) whereby an internet address is flooded with bogus traffic , effectively making it unreachable			1
the actions can also jam other websites hosted by the same provider which is why the agency decided to go offline			1
a @entity2 spokesman said : ' it is important to stress this is not a hacking attack			1
a ddos is entirely different where a large number of computers try to access the site at the same time			1
danger : similar attacks on the @entity2 website have previously been linked to the ' hacktivist ' group @entity25 ' the huge flow of traffic causes the website to potentially fall over			1
we took the decision to take down the site at 10pm last night to limit the impact on other clients hosted by the same service provider			2
' it is a temporary inconvenience and we will put the site back up once the action stops			2
we can not say at the moment when that might be			2
' he went on : ' it is also important to stress there was no security risk and the website only contains publicly available information , it does not provide access to operational material			2
' @entity6 attacks on the @entity2 website have previously been linked to the loose - knit international ' hacktivist ' group @entity25			1
the spokesman added that it would ' not be appropriate ' to comment on who may have been responsible			2
@entity2 has recently closed 36 websites believed to be selling stolen credit card information			2
last month , @entity2 was part of a joint effort with the @entity58 to shut websites associated with selling stolen financial information			0
the agency said 2.5 million items of compromised data was recovered , preventing an estimated potential fraud of Â£ 500m			0
former prime minister @entity65 speaks during the official launch of @entity2 in 2006 the website has been targeted in the past by members of ' hacktivist ' group @entity70			1
in june 2011 , they forced the site offline using similar tactics			0
@entity74 , of anti computer virus firm @entity75 based in @entity77 , @entity78 , described the attack as a ' thump on the nose rather than a mortal blow			0
' he said : ' it is not impossible to stop this sort of thing from happening , but quite costly , and @entity2 may want to look at what they have in place to prevent future occurrences			0
' government websites expect to be atacked from time to time and it is just an inconvenience			0
large numbers of people visit the website for legitimate reasons and at the moment are unable to do so			0
' the attack could be linked to @entity70 or other hacking groups			1
it is likely to be connected to @entity2 's work			0
' yesterday , a number of @entity104 and @entity105 suspects were arrested in the @entity106 over a hacking inquiry so that could also be significant			0
' he added : ' this is the second time in less than a year that @entity2 's website has found itself the target of malicious attackers , having previously suffered from a @entity6 attack at the hands of the notorious @entity70 gang in june 2011			1
' some may suspect a @entity70 sympathiser is behind the attack , as yesterday @entity106 prosectors made public an indictment against four @entity104 and @entity105 men , suspected of being involved in an internet attack on the @entity124 security analysis firm last year			1
' until yesterday , only @entity125 , a 27 - year - old from @entity126 , had been charged in relation to the @entity124 security breach			0
but now @entity129 ( aka ' palladium ' ) , @entity131 ( aka ' pwnsauce ' ) , @entity132 ( aka ' topiary ' ) and @entity134 ( aka ' kayla ' or ' lolspoon ' ) - who were all arrested by authorities last year - have also been named			0
added mr @entity74 : ' another consideration for who might be responsible for the @entity6 is that @entity2 recently shut down 36 websites selling stolen credit card details			0
' whoever is to blame for this latest assault , it is worth remembering denial - of - service attacks are against the law			1
