all evidence of @entity4 , the secret military intelligence unit where @entity1 was based , was feared lost - because government officials ordered the destruction of its entire archive			1
but 150 classified documents were taken home by captain @entity20 and remained a secret for nearly 100 years , including a never - before seen satirical poem by @entity1			1
it imagines what famous great writers like @entity25 and @entity26 would have written had they been propaganda writers in @entity4			1

the secret propaganda unit wrote thousands of positive newspaper articles about @entity96 winners , heroism and sanitised accounts of life in the trenches			1
the work sat poorly with @entity1 , who famously once wrote a denunciation of war titled @entity103			1
mr @entity37 said : ' there are about 150 separate articles made up of pencil drafts , manuscripts , and typescripts , along with notebooks and photographs			0

mr @entity37 with the @entity80 , which contains a poem written by @entity1 about the moral difficulty of writing propaganda @entity1 's poem was a satire that imagined great writers as propagandists in @entity4 insight : one of the previously unseen documents discovered in the stash @entity1 's @entity10 stories are based on his son @entity147 â€™s adventures with his toy bear ' growler ' in @entity149 , @entity150			1
