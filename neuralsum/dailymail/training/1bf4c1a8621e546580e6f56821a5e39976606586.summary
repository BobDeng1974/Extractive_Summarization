by @entity0 @entity1 have completed the signing of @entity4 right - back @entity3 for a fee of £ 5million			1
the 24 - year - old has replaced @entity7 on @entity8 after the @entity10 international full - back finally moved to @entity11 in a £ 10m deal on thursday			1
but despite being an important member of @entity16 's @entity15 squad at the @entity17 , little is known of @entity3			1
here , @entity18 tells you more ... new signing : @entity15 right - back @entity3 has moved to @entity1 from @entity4 for £ 5million well then , who is he ? @entity3 is a 24 - year - old right - back - born in @entity23 in southern @entity15 - who has represented the @entity25 at @entity26 , under - 21 and senior level			1
he has 21 senior @entity15 caps , making his debut against @entity30 in september 2012 , and featured five times under new @entity33 manager @entity32 during the @entity17 in @entity34 where the @entity25 finished third			2
tackle : @entity3 ( left ) is not afraid to make a challenge and , although he is attacking , he can defend well too talented : @entity3 first played for @entity37 , before moving to @entity38 and then @entity4 what is his club record like ? solid and relatively impressive , if somewhat unspectacular			0
@entity3 broke into the first team at @entity37 in 2007 , playing 33 games and scoring three times for the second - tier @entity25 side			0
the right - back was then snapped up by top - division outfit @entity38 , where he spent four seasons , amassing 99 appearances and scoring on eight occasions			2
he was highly - regarded at the club and won the @entity53 - the @entity25 equivalent of the @entity55 - in his first season			0
following his successful spell at @entity38 , @entity3 moved to @entity4 on a free transfer once his contract expired			0
he quickly established himself in the team and was rewarded for his displays with a debut for the @entity15 side			0
he made 74 appearances for @entity4 , scoring five times			0
all smiles : the 24 - year - old is an attacking full - back and he is expected to fit straight into @entity1 's defence step - up ? @entity3 has better league statistics than outgoing full - back @entity7 had last season how did he do last season ? last season @entity3 played extremely well for club side @entity4 in the @entity25 @entity74 , helping them to second place in the league			1
in 30 league games , he scored twice and created five assists - showing the attacking threat he offers from full - back			2
he also had an 81 per cent pass completion ratio and 85 per cent tackle success rate - both higher than the player he is replacing , @entity7 , enjoyed in the @entity85 last season			0
although he is not the biggest defender in the world , he is decent in the air and is unlikely to be muscled off the ball			0
going @entity25 : @entity3 played five times at the @entity91 in @entity34 for @entity15 under @entity16 what sort of player are @entity1 getting ? @entity94 is effectively getting a like - for - like replacement for the outgoing @entity7			1
@entity3 loves to get forward and he will attack at every opportunity , overlapping his winger and offering himself up in the opposition half			0
he is extremely quick and is arguably a better defender than @entity7 as he covers the defence well and can sweep up opposition attacks			0
his attacking ability was shown during the third - place play - off during the @entity17 when he overlapped well to expertly pass the ball to @entity105 to score the @entity25 's third goal against @entity34			2
looking up : @entity3 is quick and is likely to excite the @entity107 faithful with his overlapping runs any weaknesses ? no obvious weaknesses that make him a liability , but his desire to attack has on occasion left a gap at right - back that the opposition can exploit			1
he is not weak but he is not the strongest so it may take him a little bit of time to adapt to the pace and power of the @entity85 , although the @entity74 has many similarities and so that should not be a problem long - term			0
where will he fit in at @entity1 ? he will slot straight in at the right - back slot vacated by @entity7 , who has left for @entity11 for £ 10m			1
@entity3 will be @entity94 's first choice and he will likely be accompanied in defence by captain @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132			2
gone : @entity3 replaces @entity10 right - back @entity7 ( pictured ) who has signed for @entity11 how did he end up in the @entity133 ? despite impressing during his time at @entity4 , challenging for the @entity25 title was not the height of his ambitions - @entity3 has described the transfer to @entity1 as the ' perfect move ' for him right now			1
the full - back has been linked with @entity141 and @entity11 in the past - as well as @entity33 due to the @entity32 connection - and @entity3 confirmed he turned down interest from @entity143 to move to the @entity133 of @entity144			1
black and white : @entity3 poses with manager @entity94 at @entity1 's training ground			2

@entity3 is one of six *summer* signings made by manager @entity94
the right - back played under @entity16 for @entity15 during @entity17
he replaces @entity7 who has signed for @entity11 for £ *10million*
the 24 - year - old is almost a like - for - like replacement for @entity7
he is *renowned* for his pace and his ability to attack down the flanks
