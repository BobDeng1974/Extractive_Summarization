by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 11:26 est , 26 september 2013 guns , gangs and violence are often the things associated with @entity5 , but one group of gamers play the smash hit to point something altogether less dangerous than a pistol ... a camera			1
these stunning images may look like they were taken by professionals using quality equpiment but they were actually snapped by a group of photographers gathered into a group on @entity18 @entity19 , a professional landscape photographer , began taking shots with the game 's camera phone app and was so amazed by the level of detail he began uploading his images to the web			1
future photography : @entity28 born photographer @entity19 uses @entity18 's camera phone feature to take these stunning images			1
he travels around the massive landscape of the game to find beauty spots before using his real life skills to perfectly frame the pictures			2
he shared the images on a blog which was shared by gamers			0
soon @entity19 , 45 , had requests of tens of photographers looking to join his @entity41 group ' landscape photographers of @entity43 and @entity44 ' , named after the fictional city in which the game is set			1
the group has a strict policy of no selfies , shooting and killing images or those of a violent or sexual reference , eliminating some of the traditional features associated with @entity53			0
@entity19 , originally from the @entity28 but currently living in @entity54 , @entity55 , hopes his group of snap - happy gamers can eventually have an in - game get - together when @entity53 's online mode is activated in the coming weeks			1
camera community : although these pictures are all taken by the 45 - year - old , who lives in @entity64 , @entity53 photography has taken off since the launch of the latest game			2
@entity19 said he has been inundated with requests from other players who want to join his ' posse ' , landscape photographers of @entity43 and @entity44 he said : ' it is pretty close to the experience of taking photographs with a camera phone - no exposure control , minimal zoom but at least there 's a rule - of - thirds overlay			1
' i wish there were in store camera shops as there are gun shops			0
i want to be able to buy a replica of my @entity84 so i can do hdr or even under or over expose images			0
' i want to be able to blur headlights or freeze a leaping deer keeping it clean : the rules of @entity19 's in - game photography club are very strict with no selfies , shooting and killing images or those of a violent or sexual reference allowed			1
he said by banning some of the scene 's normally associated with @entity53 , they can show how the game can be used for more cultured pursuits			0
' i made the group because i realised i could make realistic images and art. i 'm fascinated by the future of gaming and i see that it will become more and more like reality , and i think this is one minor way of pushing that forward			0
' the game is beautiful , spacious , interesting , hilarious			0
' there is no reason that one should n't be able to put together a ' posse ' in - game , which is dedicated to wandering the hills of @entity44 and chatting via @entity115 headsets about life , the universe and photography , whilst taking pictures and even giving composition suggestions			0
' real life : professional snapper @entity19 , above , did not have any zoom , aperture or exposure control in the game , so he had to rely on his trained eye to see the perfect picture			2
the @entity53 fan is now hoping that game developers @entity130 will introduce more camera features so that gamers can enjoy culture as well as crime .			2
