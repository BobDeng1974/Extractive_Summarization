by @entity0 life existed before @entity3 , and may have originated outside out solar system , researchers have claimed			1
geneticists have used a theory that usually governs the speed increases of computers - and applied it to life			1
the results suggest life first appeared about 10 billion years ago - long before @entity3 , which is believed to be 4.5 billion years old			1
the start of life on @entity3 ? geneticists have used a theory that usually governs the speed increases of computers - and applied it to life			1
the results suggest life first appeared about 10 billion years ago - long before @entity3 , which is believed to be 4.5 billion years old			1
@entity20 is the hypothesis that life exists throughout the @entity23 and is spread by meteoroids , asteroids and planetoids			0
@entity20 proposes that life forms that can survive the effects of space , such as extremophiles , become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life			0
these life - forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with protoplanetary disks			1
if met with ideal conditions on a new planet 's surfaces , the bacteria become active and the process of evolution begins , it is believed			0
@entity48 is the observation that computers increase exponentially in complexity , at a rate of about double the transistors per integrated circuit every two years			2
if you apply @entity48 to just the last few years ' rate of computational advances and work backwards , you end up in the 1960s , when the first microchip were invented			2
@entity59 at the @entity60 in @entity62 @entity61 at the @entity63 in @entity64 , decided to apply this theory to life and see when it began			0
the pair argue that it ’s possible to measure the complexity of life and the rate at which it has increased from prokaryotes to eukaryotes to more complex creatures such as worms , fish and finally mammals			0
' linear regression of genetic complexity ( on a log scale ) extrapolated back to just one base pair suggests the time of the origin of life = 9.7 ± 2.5 billion years ago , ' they say in a paper published in the online journal @entity89			1
the theory backs the idea of panspermia , a theory that proposes that life forms that can survive the effects of space , such as extremophiles , become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life			0
these life - forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with protoplanetary disks			2
if met with ideal conditions on a new planet 's surfaces , the bacteria become active and the process of evolution begins , it is believed			0
the results suggest life first appeared about 10 billion years ago - long before @entity3 , which is believed to be 4.5 billion years old			1
however , the researchers admit much of their work is theoretical			0
' there are lots of hypothetical elements to [ our argument ] … but to make a wider view , you need some hypothetical elements , ' @entity59 told @entity127			0
' contamination with bacterial spores from space appears the most plausible hypothesis that explains the early appearance of life on @entity3 , ' they argue in the paper			2
@entity59 said that if he had to bet on it , he ’d say ' it 's 99 percent true that life started before @entity3 — but we should leave 1 percent for some wild chance that we have n’t accounted for			2

geneticists applied @entity48 's *law* of computer power to life - and found it adds *weight* to the theory life originated away from @entity3
results suggest life first appeared about 10 billion years ago , far older than the @entity3 's projected age of 4.5 billion years
