by @entity0 published : 09:03 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 15:28 est , 5 july 2013 for @entity8 die - hards , submerging yourself in @entity4 ' world of lords , ladies and servants quarters must sound like a dream			1
and now it will be possible to emulate the make - up of @entity12 of @entity13 , and even smell like @entity13 , thanks to a new line of @entity8 - themed beauty products being launched by @entity17 to celebrate the fourth series , to be screened on @entity19 in october			1
the phenomenally successful period drama set in the aristocratic world of a @entity23 estate has seduced the nation the @entity25 ( £ 8.50 ) and the three - shade @entity27 collection ( £ 9.50 ) the @entity8 products will allow people to emulate the look , and even the smell , of their favorite characters its heady combination of family and class narratives have provided a window into the world of luxury and glamour upstairs , and the drudgery taking place downstairs			1
it has even been successfully exported to the @entity45			0
@entity17 hope that the 10 - piece gift collection , which includes soaps , a scented candle , lipstick , crème bath and nail varnishes - will appeal to the thousands of fans who want to emulate the world of @entity13 and @entity55 and the @entity56			1
the costumes and makeup of the @entity8 ladies like @entity60 ( left ) and @entity61 ( right ) have become popular again , as women want to recreate the elegance of the period @entity8 's steamy plot lines have kept its legions of fans hooked for three seasons , and anticipation is high for the fourth and the products would not be out of place on @entity61 's dresser or in a guest bathroom in the @entity8			2
while the world of @entity8 may be becoming more obtainable , the reality unfortunately never will			0
@entity8 itself is fictional , with @entity79 in @entity80 being used for the exterior building shots			0
although you can visit this ancient building , you will find it looks very different from the @entity86 home inside			0
most of the ' rooms ' used for interior filming were constructed and filmed at @entity90			0
each bearing the @entity92 , the packaging features delicate floral designs in rich tones of gold , emerald and burgundy , capturing the ornate @entity8 look and the classic elegance and charm of the edwardian era			2
they also each feature an iconic image of the @entity8 and a quote from the series , such as ' i 'd expect no less ' on the @entity108			2
there is even a @entity8 cosmetic bag in the range , so you can hide any historically incorrect items of your own out of sight			2
the products themselves , however , are probably less historically accurate : we doubt @entity61 and @entity60 spent their evenings painting their nails			0
the products will be available at 250 @entity17 stores across the nation and cost from £ 5 for the lip balm set - £ 49.50 for the luxury collection set			1
the maker of @entity128 has signed a two - year merchandising deal with @entity17 , so we will likely see more @entity131 based products on the shelves			1
@entity8 egg and cress sandwiches , anyone ? ' i 'd expect no less ' : @entity137 ( £ 6 ) ' no one wants to kiss a girl in black ' : @entity140 ( £ 5 )			0
