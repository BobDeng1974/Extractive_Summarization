@entity0 reject @entity1 looks set to snub @entity2 when he leaves the @entity4 giants next year			1
the @entity6 midfielder has made only three league starts for @entity0 this season , and has long been angling for a move away from the club			1
@entity2 have led the race to sign @entity1 for over a year - and the player looked set for a move to @entity14 in the summer before the @entity16 champions blocked the move - but new reports suggest that the player is set to join @entity20			2
' i felt that ( former @entity0 coach ) @entity38 had more belief in me , ' he said recently			2
@entity35 himself stated last month that ' if someone wants to leave the club , they can '			0
reports in november also revealed that @entity0 would allow @entity1 to leave in january , if a club was willing to pay the Â£ 16million asking price			1
that may be within @entity2 's budget , but it is also a reasonable demand for @entity20 , who are funded almost exclusively by @entity4 car manufacturer @entity52			1
the links to @entity52 also set @entity20 in good stead when it comes to transfer deals with @entity0 , as the company 's chairman @entity57 occupies a seat on the @entity61 board			1
for @entity1 , though , there is one reason above all why @entity20 may be more attractive than @entity2			0
the @entity64 are flying high in second place in the @entity16 this season , and are on course for @entity69 football next season			0
judging by the current situation , it is unlikely @entity30 ' side will be able to offer that perk come next summer			1
@entity1 could join fellow countryman @entity75 at the @entity76 under the clever guidance of coach @entity78 and director of sport @entity79 , @entity20 have freed themselves from the legacy of former boss , the @entity85 flop @entity86 , and begun to build a formidable looking side around the likes of @entity89 , @entity75 and @entity90			2
the relationship between @entity0 and @entity20 does have a tendency to spoil the transfer plans of @entity95 clubs			0
@entity96 was set to move to @entity97 in 2013 before @entity20 swooped on the @entity99 midfielder			0
in 2011 , the then @entity20 striker @entity100 had been linked with @entity101 and @entity102 before he was snapped up by @entity0			0
it seems @entity2 may suffer the same fate , particularly if they ca n't convince @entity1 that he will be playing @entity69 football at @entity14 next season .			0

@entity30 is said to be keen on landing @entity0 's @entity1
@entity1 is *disillusioned* with life under @entity35 at the @entity25
