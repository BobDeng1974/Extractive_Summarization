the way that we define a second could be about to change as scientists claim they have found a more accurate way to measure time			0
@entity7 researchers have demonstrated that a new type of atomic clock is so precise and stable that it could provide a new standard			1
@entity11 of the @entity12 and his colleagues claim optical lattice clocks lost just one second every 300 million years and are even more accurately than the current atomic timepieces that we make do with			1
@entity7 researchers have demonstrated that a new type of atomic clock is so precise and stable that it could provide a new standard			1
under a blue laser light , a cloud of strontium atoms kept in a vacuum fluoresces at a characteristic wavelength ( pictured ) which could be used to redefine the second the atomic clock has been used to define a second in the @entity28 since the 1960s			0
the new clocks remain as perfectly in time that experimental precision can measure , according to his research , which is published in @entity35			0
this test of stability is crucial if optical lattice clocks will be used to redefine the second , he said			2
according to @entity35 , @entity40 , another expert in atomic clock standards at the @entity42 in @entity43 , described the research as : ' very beautiful and careful work , which gives grounds for confidence in the optical lattice clock and in optical clocks generally '			1
the second has been measured to last precisely 9,192,631,770 oscillations of the microwave radiation emitted or absorbed when a caesium atom journeys between two energy states			0
the atomic clock has been used to define a second in the @entity28 since the 1960s			0
a cesium frequency standard atomic clock ( pictured ) is accurate to approximately three parts in 10 quadrillion so it loses one second over 100 million years an atomic fountain is currently the most accurate way to measure this frequency			1
a laser forces atoms in gasous caesium skywards and the emission from them probed as they travel through a microwave beam twice			0
this type of atomic clock is used to set the national time standards , to which we all set our watches uses caesium atomic fountain clocks			1
they are accurate to approximately three parts in 10 quadrillion so only lose one second over 100 million years			2
but the new optical lattice clock as well as a couple of other types can do even better			0
the optical lattice clock of interest to dr @entity11 were first demonstrated less than 20 years ago and some experts believe that they will become the most accurate clock ever			2
the researcher has demonstrated that he is able to get one optical lattice clock to tick at exactly the same time as another to demonstrate its accuracy			2
the team has also shown that its optical lattice clocks can keep pace with all three caseium fountain clocks housed at the @entity12			1
while traditional watch mechanisms ( pictured ) are attractive , stock markets , telecommunications systems and satellite navigation use incredibly accurate atomic clocks while some may question the use of such incredibly accurate time pieces , they could be used by physicists to explore if some of nature 's most constant features change over time			0
an ion clock is also in development and is currently even more accurate than optical lattice clocks			1
it loses one second every few billion years but as it relies on a single ion , is not considered dependable enough for commercial use .			0

researchers from the @entity12 have demonstrated that a new type of atomic clock is so precise and stable that it could provide a new *international* standard of time
optical lattice clocks lose just one second every 300 million years and is more accurate than the current atomic clock that we all set our watches by
while there is a rival ion clock , scientists believe optical lattice clocks could become the most accurate so far
