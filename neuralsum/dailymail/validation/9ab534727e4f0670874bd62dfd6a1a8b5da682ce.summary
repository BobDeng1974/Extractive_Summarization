gone are the days of @entity0 running in slow motion through the surf			0
a @entity4 company has invented the world 's first lifeguard drone - which could soon replace the human lifesavers on a beach near you			1
the drones , carrying cameras and rubber rings , can be sent out by lifeguards from the shore , and can allegedly rescue drowning holiday makers quicker than humans , who 'd have to battle through the waves			1
@entity18 , 28 , co-founder of @entity19 , launched the business in @entity21 but has moved to @entity22 after gaining start - up support and will present a prototype next month			0
complete with lights and thermal cameras for night rescues , the drones could appear on holiday beaches in time for summer , even aiding with rescues of ships and yachts in trouble			1
' at the moment many people talk about bad drones and drones that are spying and killing people but i think everything has a good side and a bad side , ' said @entity18			1
@entity0 in 1990s tv show baywatch : many fans fondly remember her trademark red swimsuit ' people should see the good side to drones where they can save lives ' he said			2
' the drones can reach people stranded at sea far quicker than lifeguards and can deploy three buoyancy aids in one flight			1
' @entity18 and his business partner partner @entity58 , 27 , hope that one day the drones will be stationed on floating platforms where they can be charged from solar energy			0
the drones can reach people far quicker than lifeguards and can deploy three buoyancy aids in one flight ' this is the future of lifeguards i believe , ' @entity18 said			1
' in a competition , we found a lifeguard could perform a rescue in 90 seconds , but the drone took 20 seconds			2
that 70 seconds could be the difference between life and death			0
' finding people is hard with rescue teams			2
moving in boats , you do n't get good vision.but the drones ' range and height can spot a drowning person , which is really helpful for ships			2
eventually the drones may be stationed on floating platforms where they can be charged from solar energy ' a rescue team could take 10 to 12 minutes where a drone could take one minute			1
basically this increases the efficiency and decreases danger to lifeguards			0
@entity19 , based in @entity97 , in @entity98 , east @entity22 , are also hoping to develop a drone that can perform mountain rescues			0
in one of the @entity4 's main holiday hotspots , @entity104 and @entity105 , more than 8,500 people were caught up in beach and sea rescue dramas last year			1
@entity108 showed that a lifeguard could perform a rescue in 90 seconds while the drone took just 20 seconds the inventors are hoping to decrease the number of people that drown by up to 60 per cent @entity115 alone had 1,000 incidents , according to the @entity117			1
' we have n't any contacts for @entity104 yet but hopefully we can deploy this at beaches in the @entity4 and right around the world , ' said @entity18			2
' we 're looking forward to hopefully decreasing the number of people that drown by up to 60 per cent with new technologies , where our drone is one of those technologies			2
' we 're not totally using autonomous drones in the first stage			0
the company hopes to deploy their invention at beaches in the @entity4 as well as around the world ' we 're using human intelligence on one side and the abilities of this technology to save lives quicker and more efficiently			1
' @entity140 , a surfer who works in @entity141 , said : ' i 'm not sure how they 're going to be programmed and how the drones would react to different people			0
but @entity146 , who works on @entity148 beach , thinks the idea could take off			0
she said : ' as long as it would n't take over the lifeguards and ruin their jobs then it 's a good thing			0
' so long as the lifeguards were still there - because you still need humans who know what to do			0

@entity4 company invents a drone to rescue holiday makers in trouble
*bosses* says it can reach drowning people faster than human lifeguards
drones carry rubber rings and are sent out from the shore to swimmers
