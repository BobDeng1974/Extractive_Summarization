@entity0 was knocked out of @entity1 at the quarter - final stage by @entity3 on wednesday as the defending champion succumbed meekly in straight sets			1
despite having won two major titles and @entity8 gold , @entity0 has at times been guilty of losing with a whimper at the highest level			0
here , @entity12 looks back at occasions when the @entity14 has underperformed			0
@entity15 2014 @entity16 – @entity17 beat @entity0 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 1 having missed @entity15 the year before due to a back injury , @entity0 impressively reached the last four in @entity19 for a second time			1
two tough five - setters earlier in the tournament against @entity23 and @entity24 came back to bite as the @entity14 ran out of gas against the ‘ @entity17 ’ , winning only 10 points on @entity17 ’s serve as he was knocked out in one hour and 40 minutes			0
making light work of that : @entity17 beat @entity0 in just an hour and 40 minutes at the @entity15 @entity29 2013 @entity30 – @entity31 beat @entity0 6 - 4 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 coming into a @entity32 for the first time as a defending champion and with the confidence gained from ending the 77 - year wait for a @entity1 male champion , @entity0 was highly fancied to claim a second @entity29 crown			1
big - hitting @entity31 prevailed , though , in two hours and 15 minutes as a frustrated @entity0 claimed he was mentally exhausted after his @entity40 heroics			2
problem : @entity0 could n't take the strain as he went out to @entity31 at the @entity29 last year @entity43 2011 f – @entity44 beat @entity0 6 - 4 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 3 @entity44 condemned @entity0 to his third @entity32 final defeat as the @entity46 stormed to victory on a hot and humid night in @entity48			1
a nervy start cost @entity0 and he failed to find a way back into the match			0
@entity0 struggled to deal with the aftermath as he suffered a slump in form , losing his next three tournament openers in straight sets			2
theme : @entity44 condemned @entity0 to his third @entity32 final defeat at the @entity58 @entity15 2010 4r – @entity59 beat @entity0 6 - 4 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 3 dark clouds gathered over court @entity61 as @entity0 ’s frustrations boiled over in a rain - delayed encounter			1
play looked to be done for the day as the match was suspended at 8pm due to rain with @entity59 leading 6 - 4 , 3 - 4 , but the weather cleared and the players returned to the court			2
@entity0 looked as if he did not want to be there and the @entity70 took just 50 minutes to wrap up the win			0
shock : @entity0 could n't control his emotions during a 2010 @entity15 defeat against @entity59 @entity29 2009 4r – @entity76 beat @entity0 7 - 5 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 2 @entity0 always reckoned his search for a @entity32 title would end on the hard courts of @entity80 and rightly so after reaching the final the previous year			1
however , @entity0 failed to take two set points in the first set and had no answer to @entity76 ’s power as the @entity86 took charge to seal the upset			2
it later transpired that @entity0 had been suffering a wrist injury			0
learning curve : @entity86 @entity76 bounced on mistakes made by @entity0 at the @entity93 @entity94 joins @entity17 in early exit			0

@entity0 beaten in straight sets 6 - 1 , 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) , 6 - 2 by @entity3
defending champion has suffered *uninspiring* defeats to @entity44 , @entity76 , @entity59 and @entity31 in the past
