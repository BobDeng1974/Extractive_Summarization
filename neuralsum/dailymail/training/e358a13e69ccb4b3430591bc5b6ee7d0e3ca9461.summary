have you heard the one about the mouse who walked into the yarrow flower ? no ? well , this little fellow has ... and he thinks it 's very , very funny			2
the tiny dormouse could not suppress his delight that spring has finally come when he got to the top of this blossom			1
quivering with glee , the little giggler threw back his head , thrust his whiskers in the air and let out a hearty chuckle			2
what 's so funny ? grinning from ear to ear , this tiny dormouse appears to have been tickled by something as it clambered up this yarrow flower worth the wait : the amusing photograph , taken by @entity25 photographer @entity24 , 28 , in @entity25 , who lay in wait for days on end waiting for the perfect shot that , or the unfortunate rodent was allergic to the flower 's pollen brought out by the changing seasons and was just about to sneeze			1
in any case , he certainly looks like he is having a squeal of a time as he basks in the @entity25 countryside , bathed in the springtime sun. the amusing photograph , taken by @entity25 photographer @entity24 , 28 , in @entity25 , who lay in wait for days on end waiting for the perfect shot			1
and as this hilarious picture shows , it was well worth the wait			1
due to loss of habitat , dormice are now rarely seen			0
they are nocturnal creatures and grow to up to 6.5in in length , weigh about seven ounces and can live up to five years			0
they have an excellent sense of hearing , are omnivorous and feed on fruits , berries , flowers , nuts and insects			0
during hibernation , they usually sleep in a tightly woven nest on the ground , often in a pile of leaves - as they like the damp and cool conditions			0
this is in stark contrast to the arboreal lifestyle they lead in the active season .			0
