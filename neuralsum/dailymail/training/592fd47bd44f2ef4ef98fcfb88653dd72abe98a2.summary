@entity0 had a new look and there were a few early signs of a new game style as he kicked off his season with a surprisingly hard - fought exhibition victory over @entity8 ’s @entity7			1
with the all black kit of his suppliers under @entity11 making its debut , @entity0 took two and a half hours to defeat the world no 14 7 - 6 , 5 - 7 , 6 - 4 at the @entity15 in @entity16			1
despite the length of the match , there was more intent from the @entity22 champion to shorten the points by being prepared to attack the net , something he is sure to have worked on over the past month with coach @entity27			0
@entity0 eventually saw off @entity7 after a two and a half hour match to kick off his season the @entity30 no 1 was wearing his new all - black @entity11 kit in @entity16 for his first match of the year it may be an unofficial event with no ranking points at stake but there was precious little hit ‘ n giggle about an intense contest , with both players clearly keen to get a proper game in with so little time ahead of this month ’s @entity42			1
‘ it was a tough match and the last few games were very hard , ’ said @entity0 , who is training hard alongside competing this week			2
‘ it was a hard way to start the new year and i hope the matches get a bit easier from now on ! ’ @entity0 takes on @entity49 in the tournament semi-final on friday , with the @entity53 champion very much in need of match tightness with @entity56 already looming			1
the experienced @entity57 @entity7 put up a brave fight before @entity0 eventually came through @entity0 was more aggressive than usual , but the new approach was not always as successful as hoped @entity0 looks to be trying to develop his net game and overall tried to be more aggressive than we are accustomed to seeing			0
the intention was commendable although the results were mixed against the veteran lefthander			0
he was by far the better player in the tiebreak which he won 7 - 1 , before letting the second set slip late on			2
he broke serve three times in the decider but struggled to consolidate his lead and close it out , needing five match points in the final game			0
in the second match , @entity74 saw off another @entity57 in @entity76 with a straight - sets victory in just over an hour			0
@entity0 was made to work hard for his victory , and said he hoped the matches get easier as the year goes on @entity74 set up a clash with @entity82 1 @entity81 with a convincing win over @entity76 @entity74 put on a dominant display to clinch the first set 6 - 3 before @entity76 , who replaced @entity86 in the tournament as the @entity88 nurses an arm injury , came out of the blocks flying - winning the first game of the second without dropping a point			1
but his @entity94 opponent got the better of him and turned the set around as he raced to a 6 - 2 victory to set up a last - four clash with world no 1 and defending champion @entity81 .			0

@entity0 wins 7 - 6 5 - 7 6 - 4 against the experienced @entity8 player
