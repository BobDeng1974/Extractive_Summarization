by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:32 est , 26 april 2013 updated : 04:37 est , 26 april 2013 @entity2 have ignored warnings that they risk looking lazy and today begin another two - week holiday			1
the latest break comes just days since the @entity8 ' two and a half week @entity7 recess			2
they will return on may 8 for the @entity10 , but only spend eight days in @entity11 before heading off again for a 10 - day whitsun get - away			1
empty benches : the latest holiday for @entity2 means they have spent less than half of 2013 so far in the @entity16 it means that in the first 150 days of 2013 , the commons will have been convened just 64 times			1
the revelation that mps have met in the @entity11 for less than every other day would appear to contradict assertions from senior ministers including @entity24 and @entity25 that @entity26 must work harder to get the country back on its feet			1
the latest holiday sparked accusations that the government had run out of ideas and legislation was being rushed through without being properly scrutinised			2
the frequent holidays means @entity24 and @entity36 have gone head - to - head at @entity39 's questions just twice in 12 weeks earlier this month @entity40 , the @entity41 mp who chairs @entity11 ’s spending watchdog , warned the public think politicians are lazy and provide poor value for money			1
' we are living through the worst economic crisis in modern times			2
@entity2 have a lot to do and yet we are spending much of our time in recess , ’ she said			0
' members of the public would be forgiven for thinking that it is mps who are lazy and that it is @entity57 that is failing to provide good value for money			2
@entity41 's @entity40 has warned that the public think mps are lazy ' we are not spending enough time in @entity11 , and this creates a democratic vacuum			1
' today the @entity8 begins a 12 - day break triggered by prorogation – the gap between one session of @entity57 and the next			1
traditionally @entity57 has only broken up for a few days to prepare for the @entity10 , which sets out new laws planned for the new session			1
but the long and frequent holidays means @entity24 has missed several sessions of prime minister ’s questions			0
there were just two in the last 12 weeks			0
@entity78 , chief executive of the @entity79 said : ‘ it ’s ridiculous that @entity57 has shut up shop again when so many of its debates get curtailed by strict timetables and important bills have been rushed through			0
‘ the amount of time that the @entity8 spends in recess should be a huge cause for concern as it prevents mps from properly scrutinising the government for big chunks of the year			0
‘ with this latest break so close to the local elections , many taxpayers will be left wondering whether it is more about freeing up time for the politicians go out knocking on doors in support of their political friends rather than getting down to work in their constituencies			0
’ @entity41 mp @entity104 said : ‘ we are going to be on holiday for another two weeks when we could have been discussing really serious things			0
’ @entity108 , @entity41 mp for @entity109 , added : ‘ the government has clearly run out of ideas			0

commons will not *sit* again until @entity10 on may 8
mps will be in @entity11 for eight days before 10 - day @entity117 holiday
for first 150 days of 2013 , commons will convene just 64 times
