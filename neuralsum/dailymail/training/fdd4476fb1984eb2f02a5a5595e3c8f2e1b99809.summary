the @entity6 , was tirelessly trying to find some food , managed to wedge his head through the tiny opening of a jar , but could n't get its furry face back out			2

the tired raccoon sat on top of a trash can and almost passed out in resignation before @entity24 came to free the animal from it 's sticky situation			0
once a firefighter freed the racoons from the jar , it joyfully leaped from the firefighter 's hands and scampered off to find some more food hopefully -- hopefully not in any tight spaces			0
a firefighter from @entity36 rescue told @entity37 that this was a rare occasion for them and that while they do animal and fire rescue , less people call about animals than they do people but that they do their best to help both			1
