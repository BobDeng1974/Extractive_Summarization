by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob @entity1 is one of the @entity3 's honest professionals			1
he probably knew he had not played well on thursday night against @entity4 , yet he was prepared to discuss the performance and reflect on @entity7 's campaign			1
' @entity9 football at its worst , ' said @entity1 , describing the disappointment , before he was quizzed on some of the positive aspects of the attacking play and the emergence of younger players			0
' yeah , but we 've not come to this tournament just to blood youngsters , turn up and hopefully they do well			1
we 've come here to do well , to perform and to qualify			0
' @entity18 : @entity19 , @entity1 , @entity20 and @entity21 during training on saturday it was succinct and correct			0
there might be some building blocks for @entity26 from the rubble of this @entity9 but five - year plans are football 's biggest cliche			1
the trick of the job is to get results while developing a team			0
@entity35 needs to be judged on what happened in @entity37 , not on what might happen in @entity39 in two years ' time , and even with expectations at an all - time low he managed to underachieve here			1
everyone wanted to see progress in @entity37 but nobody said there was a free pass to lose the opening two games			0
@entity7 had a difficult group but nobody anticipated them being out within five days			1
and though everyone was aware @entity54 would be a huge threat , it was not unreasonable to expect to match a nation of three million and a country which finished fifth in the @entity59 group and qualified by beating @entity60 in a play - off			1
' results colour everything , ' said @entity35			0
' results colour your judgment , colour everybody 's judgment			2
i 'm happy with the way the players prepared for these games and the way they approached the tournament			2
i 'm really happy with the dedication and effort they have put in			0
but we 've played two experienced and strong teams and on both occasions we 've come out second			0
' at the heart of this @entity9 campaign is a conundrum			0
how was @entity35 - a coach associated with meticulous planning , rigid team shape and solidity - undone by an excess of attacking ? disappointment : @entity7 were undone by defensive lapses against @entity89 and @entity4 almost everyone embraced the idea of aggressive , forward - thinking football			1
indeed , the biggest fear was @entity35 would fail to embrace the public mood			0
pundits , media , players and public were united that it was the way forward and because it has failed that does not mean the idea was a bad one			0
@entity35 galvanised the nation with a defeat last saturday because @entity7 looked like a proper international team			1
but in our desire to be something more than the dire 2010 team or the less - than - dynamic 2006 squad , we overdid the enthusiasm			2
certainly foreign journalists were bemused by the phlegmatic reaction to defeat			0
now it would be trite to carry on regardless and without modification			0
@entity7 should play on the front foot and the nature of the players emerging dictates that they will			1
that said , at times it looked as though @entity7 were stuck in sixth gear , racing forwards and unable to move down through the cogs when required			1
the intention was to play with full backs pushed on , as is the fashion , to overwhelm the opposition			0
and it worked on occasions			0
when @entity20 released @entity21 to get into the box and set up @entity134 for his goal against @entity4 , there was the proof			0
@entity137 , criticised for his defensive work , was singled out by @entity139 for causing @entity4 problems			2
forward planning : @entity134 could take over @entity19 's playmaker role however , there is a flipside			2
@entity137 being so far forward as @entity7 attacked just before @entity54 's opening goal affected the defensive shape and allowed the @entity147 striker to drift between the left - back and @entity1 to score			1
the goal for which @entity137 received most blame , when @entity89 's @entity151 turned him the wrong way to cross for @entity153 , had as much to do with @entity155 's positioning			2
as an instinctive forward player , @entity155 could not get back in time to prevent the run of @entity158 , leaving @entity137 exposed			1
that , however , is the manner of modern football			0
full - backs have to be great attackers and solid defenders			2
@entity137 proved adept at one part of the task , but not the other			0
indeed , @entity7 's defensive shape was the most worrying aspect of the tournament			1
@entity35 can not suddenly conjure better defenders - though @entity172 's absence and the unwillingness to bring back @entity174 look unwise now - but this manager 's teams are traditionally well organised			1
in a conversation after the @entity178 warm - up game , @entity35 was complimented on the team 's set - pieces , yet he was nonplussed			1
' what we worked hard on ( in @entity184 ) was our shape , ' he said			2
' i 'd have been much happier if you 'd said to me , " i thought the shape of the team was good tonight "			2
' big fan : @entity139 singled out @entity7 defender @entity137 for praise for the first 30 minutes against @entity89 and for 25 minutes in the second half against @entity4 , the shape was good and the tactics worked			1
yet in the key moments which decided both games , defenders were pulled out of position			0
had @entity35 set up cautiously like he did at @entity200 , he might have been vilified but would probably have two points by now			0
as a coach , he performed better two years ago when he coaxed more from a limited group			2
then there is the issue of @entity19			0
@entity4 nullified him with a simple game plan which had all the hallmarks of @entity54 's inside knowledge			2
@entity209 distributing the ball from the back and @entity7 become a disjointed and nervous team in possession			1
@entity214 and @entity215 did that job excellently			0
they also harried @entity1 and @entity218 , meaning @entity7 rarely had any fluidity and could not establish a passing game			1
disrupting @entity7 ought not to be so simple			1
@entity19 may well retire from international football this week and @entity7 have a dearth of players who can fulfil his midfield holding role , which is going to be @entity35 's biggest problem now			1
perhaps @entity134 will one day do the job			0
those who have managed him believe that is a serious possibility			2
for now @entity35 will stay and choose to take the positives			0
' i believe @entity7 have a very strong basis for a team , ' he said			1
' it 's a very young team			2
in the space of two years these players have to get better and stronger			0
playing together as an @entity7 team will make them better and stronger			1
influence : @entity7 could have done with experience of @entity174 and @entity172 in @entity37 ' i 've never doubted that as this team move forward , not just to 2016 but even on from there , they will do so			1
but for the moment they have to suck on this very , very bitter pill that their hopes and dreams have floundered here because we were n't able to win the games			0
' an absence of viable alternatives means @entity35 will be allowed to continue			2
however , he ca n't always be looking two years ahead			0
attacking football is part of the answer but @entity7 failed playing it in @entity37			1
if @entity35 does n't make changes , if he can not uncover better defenders and it proves impossible to replace @entity19 , @entity7 will stay in the realm of five - year plans , bright futures and false hope for the next big tournament .			1

even with expectations at an all - time low @entity7 managed to underachieve
it was a group group but nobody anticipated them being out within five days
@entity7 's defensive shape was the most worrying aspect of the tournament
@entity172 's absence and unwillingness to bring back @entity174 look unwise now
