the @entity3 should belong to @entity4 , the authors of a new book on the disputed islands have sensationally claimed			2
a forgotten 172 - year - old treaty signed between @entity6 and the south @entity8 country gives it sovereignty rights over the @entity12 colony , they say			1
@entity4 architect @entity13 , one of the two authors of the book , insisted last night : ' legally , the islands are ours			2
' disputed : now the authors of a new book on the @entity3 have made the sensational claim that they actually belong to @entity4 co-author @entity20 , an @entity21 engineer , added : ' for me , as an @entity21 , it was very difficult to come to terms with this			2
' the book , whose title translates into @entity29 as ' the @entity3			0
are they @entity4 ? ' argues colonial @entity6 controlled the region 's seas , islands and coastline from naval bases ion @entity37 , @entity38 and the @entity4 capital @entity40			1
mr @entity13 said : ' no - one remembers an 1841 treaty signed between @entity6 and @entity4			1
' in that document , @entity6 cedes it the naval base 's powers			1
history : steel helmets abandoned by @entity21 armed forces who surrendered at @entity50 to @entity52 troops during the @entity53 ours : a @entity12 flag is planted at a farm in the @entity3			0
residents will vote in a referendum on march 11 about whether they want to remain part of the @entity12 war of words : president of @entity21 , @entity63 , pictured left , accuses @entity12 of stealing the @entity3 in an open letter addressed to prime minister @entity66 ' seventeen years later , @entity6 does the same with @entity21 , but it could n't give it something it 's already given to another			1
that is a very strong argument in favour of @entity4			0
' a 1972 international agreement on the @entity74 confirmed @entity4 as the rightful owner of the @entity3 because it was based on the 1841 treaty , mr @entity20 added			1
the @entity6 discovered @entity4 in 1516 but due to fierce resistance from the local @entity79 and an absence of gold or silver , only a few settlements were established during the 16th and 17th centuries			1
the capital @entity40 , was founded by the @entity6 in the early 18th century as a military stronghold but soon developed into a thriving commercial hub competing with @entity87			1
in 1811 a successful revolt against @entity6 rule was led by @entity90			1
it was at this point that the then @entity6 governor of the @entity3 , @entity93 , was called back to @entity40			1
he left behind a plaque claiming sovereignty of the islands for @entity6			1
@entity12 had withdrawn their presence from the @entity3 in 1776 , leaving @entity6 in control			1
in 1821 @entity4 declared independence and sided with @entity21 in a war against @entity102			0
@entity12 then fostered the @entity103 , which gave birth to @entity4 as an independent state			0
historians insist the @entity3 had no established @entity21 population at the time the @entity12 re-took control in 1833			0
he told an interviewer : ' it was signed first in the @entity4 senate and then in the @entity21 senate			0
' the basis of that signature is the 1841 treaty			1
' when the @entity21 legislators signed , they were recognising that agreement			0
' it 's obvious they did n't read what they signed			0
' one option is to do nothing and let @entity21 and @entity12 carry on their war of words over the islands , the authors argue			0
but they also claim @entity4 would be within its rights to start negotiations with the @entity12 and @entity21 about proposals to divide up the disputed territory			0
international analyst @entity134 described the book today as a ' historical curiosity ' but quashed the idea @entity4 had any sovereignty claim over the @entity3			2
he insisted : ' @entity4 has never shown any type of interest in that area and it would be a triviality for it to now make any sovereignty claim			2
' the @entity144 recognise that the only two countries who lay claim to sovereignty are the @entity12 and @entity21			2
' @entity21 president @entity63 upped the ante recently over the @entity3			0
she wrote an open letter earlier this month to @entity66 accusing @entity12 of stripping the @entity3 from @entity21 in an aggressive act of colonialism 180 years ago			0
the @entity154 newspaper wrote a reply to mrs @entity63 , published in @entity21 newspapers , pointing out @entity12 sovereignty over the @entity3 dates back to 1765			2
the islanders are due to vote on sovereignty in a referendum on march 10 and 11			1
they are expected to send a firm message to @entity21 they wanted to remain @entity12 .			0
