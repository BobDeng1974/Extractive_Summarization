a growing number of young women are fuelling dangerous eating disorders by taking ' selfies ' to document their weight loss , a leading expert has warned			1
dr @entity6 , medical director and consultant psychiatrist at the @entity9 group , said more and more young women suffering from eating disorders are taking pictures of themselves and sharing them with friends			1
this competitive selfie dieting ' diaries ' trend , he says , is creating damaging psychological pressures that can exacerbate anorexia and other potentially fatal illnesses			1
@entity20 - a self - portrait photograph taken with a hand - held digital camera or camera phone - have become increasingly popular among social media users over the last few years			0
@entity25 has been criticised by anorexia campaigners after her rapper husband @entity27 said a photograph of her was a ' thinspiration ' dr @entity6 said : ' some people will take repeated pictures of themselves at various stages of their illness , and send them to others			1
' they want to keep a record of their illness and see for themselves , as it were , the progress they think they are making towards anorexia , but they will also transmit the images to other sufferers on occasions			2
' it 's the younger women doing this			2
they tend to be in their teens or in their twenties and really into their phones			0
' it 's only become very apparent to me in the last year			0
patients have talked to me about it			0
' it 's a reflection of the social media age			0
devices make it so easy to do and it is a way of people expressing themselves and their attitude towards the illness			0
it 's a new and rising trend to me , and it 's certainly happening among increasing numbers of young people			0
' student @entity66 , who took ' thinspiration selfies ' to track her dramatic weight loss , spoke out last year to warn others of the dangers			1
the 17 - year - old , from @entity72 , @entity73 , uploaded pictures of her shrinking frame onto a password protected blog as motivation to continue to lose more weight			2
@entity83 star @entity82 regularly posts ' skinny selfies ' documenting her dramatic wright loss she reached six stone and was on the verge of being hospitalised for the second time , before something finally ' clicked ' and she began to regain weight			1
dr @entity6 , who works at the @entity92 , said in some cases , young women were encouraged to reduce their weight to dangerous levels by looking at so - called ' thinspiration ' websites			1
thinspiration websites , some which display images of concave stomachs and protruding ribs , include blogs written by extreme dieters who upload their ' tips and tricks ' to encourage others with eating disorders to lose more weight			2
some sites , and hashtags , promote the pursuit of the ' thigh gap ' , when women try to become so thin that their thighs do not touch even when their feet are together			2
disturbing photographs and internet blogs are often accompanied by ' thinspirational ' messages such as ' food is the enemy ' and ' starving for perfection '			0
@entity123 ( left ) and @entity124 ( right ) , who both starred in @entity83 , also regularly post pictures of themselves documenting their weight loss one site , for example , suggested that grumbling stomach noises were in fact ' applause ' for self - starvation			1
dr @entity6 's warning , ahead of @entity134 ( 23 - 27 february ) , came as the @entity135 , - the @entity137 's largest provider of eating disorders treatments outside the @entity139 - disclosed it had seen a 15 per cent rise in adult patients admitted with eating disorders in just one year , increasing to 535 in 2014 , up from 463 in 2013			1
although the largest group of patients were those aged between 18 and 25 , with 169 admissions , the largest increase in admissions occurred between those aged 36 and 45 which almost doubled from 40 to 73			0
dr @entity6 said that an increasing number of women in their thirties and forties were also seeking help for eating disorders , caused in part by the stress of juggling a career with a husband , home and children			1
he told the @entity161 : ' we are in the middle of an epidemic of women who are not satisfied with their body shape and women in middle age are increasingly vulnerable to developing an eating disorder			2
' some 1.6 million people in the @entity137 are affected by an eating disorder , of which around 11 per cent are male			0
@entity172 , one of a number of eating disorders , has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder , from medical complications associated with the illness as well as suicide .			0
