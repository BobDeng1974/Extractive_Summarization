@entity0 today produced ' evidence ' that it claims shows at least one military aircraft was flying close to @entity4 when it was shot down , killing all 298 on board			1
data from air traffic controllers in @entity8 , leaked to a @entity10 newspaper , appears to show an unidentified object flying at the time of the crash on 17 july and remaining in the area for 20 minutes after the crash			1
@entity0 military experts have previously claimed a @entity18 war plane shot down the @entity20 flight , but it has taken 119 days for sources to produce the ' proof '			1
while the official @entity26 - led probe into the @entity4 horror is still underway , @entity24 sources have suggested the aircraft was downed from rebel - held @entity18 territory by a @entity0 - made @entity32 missile system			1
@entity18 has denied any of its aircraft were in the sky at the time			2
this screen grab , leaked to a @entity0 newspaper , claims to show that at least one military aircraft was flying close to @entity4 when it was shot down			1
the red arrow points to one or more unidentified aircraft which , an expert claims , bear the hallmarks of military planes			1
in the image , the blue lines apparently show the routes of other passenger planes , while the purple line is said to be the route of @entity4 until its final signal the screen grab shows the situation in the air over @entity53 and nearby areas of @entity18 at the time of the crash , claimed @entity57 , of flight safety agency , in @entity61 newspaper			1
however , @entity57 - contrary to the newspaper - told @entity62 that he was not saying it must be a @entity18 war plane			2
he says it must be a manned aircraft rather than , say , a small drone , but can not tell what altitude it was flying at			0
he conceded it could be a helicopter though this would have been more easily noticed by people on the ground			0
the ' warplane ( s ) ' gave off a ' primary signal ' which the radar detected , but not their full identification , in contrast to the passenger aircraft flying past the crash site			0
the crash happened several minutes before @entity4 was due to fly into @entity0 air space , in a sector controlled from @entity8			1
while hard for laymen to verify , he claimed the information it shows was culled directly from air traffic control data in @entity8 and that a red arrow points to one or more unidentified aircraft which , he claimed , bear the hallmarks of military planes			1
@entity10 newspaper @entity61 carried a reoprt ( above ) that claims data from air traffic controllers in @entity8 appears to show an unidentified object flying at the time of the crash on 17 july and remaining in the area for 20 minutes after the disaster			1
however , this could not be independently verified ' we fully trust the sources which helped us to make it public , ' he told the newspaper , indicating the mystery plane or planes circled over the @entity4 crash site immediately after the @entity110 was downed			1
' the data from the @entity8 radar station tells us about the situation at the moment of the crash and 20 minutes afterwards			1
' it records other identified passenger planes and @entity4 until its final signal			2
' we can clearly see that at the moment of the crash and after it , to the @entity122 of the @entity110 's route , some aircraft were flying			0
' it is likely to have been military because all the dots are very close to each other			0
we can make a conclusion that it was either one or two aircraft ; in any case , there was something there			0
in the image , the blue lines show the routes of other passenger planes			2
the purple line is the route of @entity4 until its final signal			2
the unidentified object or objects are apparently shown as a cluster of marks inside the circle			0
their routes to and from the site are not seen , apparently because they did not identify themselves in the way that passenger planes do			0
mr @entity57 said the reason there is no trail of the alleged warplane ( s ) is that the image is a snapshot of a 20 - minute period which included the moment @entity4 was downed			1
it means that the mystery aircraft ( s ) were already in place , possibly waiting for @entity4 to arrive			2
and they were still in place when the snapshot was ended			0
an emergency services worker photographs debris from @entity4 the day after the crash in @entity18 on july 17 ' military aircrafts are either not equipped with such answering devices or the pilots switch them off when working on a military task , ' he said			1
so the radar shows the plane but ' we ca n't say what is there , what sort of plane , how high it is flying			0
but the fact is that it was there			0
' he claimed that the aircraft could not be @entity0 since @entity180 would have exposed this fact immediately			0
the @entity182 fighters had no aviation , he said			0
the newspaper echoed @entity0 military experts in accusing the @entity186 and @entity18 of a cover - up of the presence of a warplane in the sky close to @entity4			1
' the fact of these marks at the radar does not fit with statements from @entity18 that its military planes were not flying in this area at that moment , ' said @entity57			1
' it is also important that the location of these marks at the radar - to the left of the @entity110 's route - fits the photographs from the crash scene where we can clearly see the left side of the cockpit and the left wing were hit			0
' it has been argued before that this is the wrong angle for a strike by a @entity32 missile			0
today 's claim echoes an allegation from commander of @entity0 @entity217 @entity216 four days after the crash			2
military sources in @entity10 said they had registered ' accelerating aircraft of @entity221 , supposedly @entity222 - 25 ' - which was approached the passenger airplane , flying at a distance of three to five kilometres			2
@entity216 claimed the military aircraft ' continued flying above the place where the passenger airplane went down '			0
@entity228 this week called for a thorough probe to determine all the causes of the plane 's demise .			0

data from air traffic controllers claims to show mystery planes near @entity4
image is said to show objects remaining in the area 20 minutes after crash
leaked to a @entity10 newspaper as ' proof ' some 119 days after the disaster
but expert says it does not *necessarily* mean objects are @entity18 planes
