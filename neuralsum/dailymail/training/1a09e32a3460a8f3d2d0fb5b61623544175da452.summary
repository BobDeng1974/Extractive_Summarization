by @entity0 sheik @entity1 has now spent around £ 1billion on his @entity3 dream , but if he put every player up for sale this summer he would only be able to recoup £ 311million in proceeds			1
that at least is one debate - provoking conclusion raised by a new report , published today , that assesses the ‘ market values ’ of players in the squads at the 98 clubs across the top divisions in @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
city have the most valuable squad in the @entity23 according to experts at the @entity26 - based @entity25 , who rate player values for summer 2014 by a wide range of ‘ objective ’ factors from age and contract expiry date to position , performance data and international experience			1
high earner : @entity36 is @entity3 's most expensive player , according to the @entity25 @entity3 ’s most valuable player is @entity36 , cies say , with a market value of £ 40m , followed by @entity40 ( £ 27m ) then @entity41 and @entity42 ( both around £ 24m )			1
the whole squad would make £ 311.3m if sold at market rates in the transfer window , the report says			1
@entity47 have the next most valuable squad who played in the @entity23 in 2013 - 14 at £ 310.5m , followed by @entity50 ( £ 300.8m ) , @entity51 ( £ 288.7m ) and @entity52 ( £ 220.2m )			2
it should be stressed these are sale values at ‘ market rates ’ this summer for all the players combined , and not what these clubs paid for those players			0
in many cases , not least at @entity3 , the players cost more than they are now worth			2
at the other extreme , @entity62 ’s squad is worth just £ 30.6m , or less than any 2013 - 14 @entity23 team , and only slightly less than @entity64 ’s ( £ 32.3m ) and @entity65 ’s ( £ 33.9m )			0
key figure : @entity41 's value is around the £ 24m mark , says the report time to cash in ? unhappy @entity42 is valued at around the £ 24m mark also across @entity74 , @entity71 ’s squad - with the world ’s most valuable player @entity72 in it - is rated as worth £ 478.2m while @entity75 ’s , with @entity76 and @entity77 in the ranks , is worth £ 393.5m in second place			1
@entity80 are next ( £ 322.6m ) followed by @entity3 , @entity47 , @entity50 and @entity51			2
the more a squad is worth , the better it performed in the @entity23 in 2013 - 14 , by and large			0
the top four most valuable squads filled the top four places and most clubs finished within a handful of places of what might be expected given their resources			0
the two main exceptions were @entity65 , who finished in 11th place , or seven places higher than their squad ranked 18th in value ; and @entity98 , who finished bottom , or six places lower than a squad worth the 14th most in the division			0
the top of the tree : with a squad value of £ 478.2m , @entity71 are the most expensive in @entity74 the full report can be bought from the @entity109 website and the authors say : ‘ from an economic perspective , it is worth highlighting results obtained by some of the clubs that were among those that spent the least to sign players fielded such as @entity65 in @entity13 , @entity118 in @entity14 , @entity119 in @entity17 , @entity120 in @entity16 and @entity121 in @entity15			2
this publication will allow you to understand what factors permitted these clubs to over-perform			0
’ more details can be found at @entity128			0

it cost more than three times as much to *assemble* , but @entity3 's squad would cost £ 311m to *buy*
the findings are from a debate provoking report from the @entity25
