@entity1 boss @entity0 has responded to speculation linking him to the @entity4 job by insisting the perfect man to manage the club is already in place at @entity8			1
@entity10 's current contract expires at the end of the season , and it has been suggested @entity4 's owners might go in a different direction ahead of the club 's move to the @entity17 at the start of the 2016 - 17 campaign			1
@entity20 has been touted as a potential candidate after leading @entity1 to a record - equalling 47 @entity22 points with six games left , but the 36 - year - old expressed his bemusement should the @entity27 club look elsewhere this summer			1
@entity4 manager @entity10 is out of contract at the end of the season and could leave the club @entity0 has been touted as a potential replacement but insists @entity10 is a perfect fit for @entity4 @entity10 has overseen a solid season in the league so far this term and the @entity4 are ninth in the table ' @entity4 have a fantastic manager in place , ' @entity0 said ahead of @entity1 's trip to bottom - placed @entity39 on saturday			1
' for them to be looking elsewhere - if they are - i think they 've already got the manager there who 's had a fantastic season			2
' @entity4 have done exceptionally well this season , progressed again , and that 's what you want from a club			1
' eighth - placed @entity1 are four points better off than the @entity4 , who have slipped to ninth after a wretched run of only two wins in their last 14 league games			1
@entity20 , the youngest manager in the @entity22 , has also earned plaudits for the way @entity1 have played this season and kept his side on track following the january sale of top scorer @entity64 to @entity65			1
' i look at that type of speculation as a compliment to the way myself and the team have worked this season , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity1 have had to cope with the january sale of star player @entity64 to @entity65 for Â£ 28m ' it shows we 're progressing and going in the right direction			2
' but @entity4 is nothing to do with me			0
my focus is purely on @entity1 and wishing to finish the season strong - and that will remain my focus			0
' the points record was a target we talked about , we committed to the work we wanted to put in place and to achieve it			0
' the players deserve massive credit but the whole thing is to get past it and we have six games to hopefully do that			0
' we 've just focussed on the next game , rather than positions , and that is the same this weekend			0
' i 'm surprised where @entity39 are because of the quality they have , but they 've put themselves in a good position to try to get out of it , so we 've got to make sure our attitude and mentality is right			0
' @entity1 's @entity101 forward @entity100 ( left ) has been sidelined for a month with a hamstring injury @entity1 must do without striker @entity100 for the next month as the @entity101 international will be sidelined by a hamstring injury picked up against @entity105 last weekend			1
@entity100 had scored four goals in his last seven games and @entity0 admits the striker 's loss has come at the wrong time			2
' it 's a blow because he 's been very confident and showing why i brought him to the club , ' @entity0 said			2
' he 's been a big player for us and it 's disappointing because he was hitting a great bit of form , scoring goals and contributing to the team			0
' i 'm sure @entity120 will come back fresh and he has the ability to really make a mark here , but it 's a chance for someone else to step up and score some goals			0
' @entity1 goalkeepers @entity127 ( left ) and @entity128 ( right ) train ahead of the game with @entity39 @entity1 left - back @entity130 ( left ) trains with his team - mates at the @entity132 on wednesday			0
