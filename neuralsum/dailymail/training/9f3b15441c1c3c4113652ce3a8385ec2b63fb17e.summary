@entity1 has asked a judge for permission to address a libel trial brought after a controversial book suggested the @entity23 may have hidden their daughter 's body and staged an abduction			1
the author of @entity28 is ex-police chief @entity29 , 56 , who was tasked with investigating @entity31 's may 2007 disappearance			1
@entity1 's husband @entity32 and mr @entity29 have already applied to speak in the @entity15 court			2
her application , revealed at the libel trial today as former police colleagues of mr @entity29 spoke in his defence , paves the way for an emotional finale to the case			2
it comes just days ahead of a new appeal by the @entity23 for information on their missing daughter on @entity47 's @entity46 which will feature a reconstruction of events in @entity50 on may 3 2007			2
it is thought @entity32 and @entity1 , 45 , will appeal directly to a kidnapper during the programme			0
@entity31 's mother flew to @entity15 for the start of the libel trial last month - but had left it to friends and relatives to testify before mr @entity29 's side launched its defence			1
judge @entity64 , referring to @entity1 by her maiden name as she revealed her change of heart , said : ' on october 2 @entity65 made an application to make a statement to this court			0
hearing : @entity69 has also expressed a wish to testify against police chief @entity71 ' the court will decide on this application once evidence has been heard by both sides as only then will it be able to judge on the need for and the pertinence of this application			1
' if given the go - ahead , the @entity23 and mr @entity29 are expected to speak on the same day on or after november 27 when the last hearing in the trial at @entity83 's @entity82 is scheduled			1
former colleagues of mr @entity29 's turned up the heat on the @entity23 today by insisting nothing he wrote in his july 2008 book was new			2
the book was published just three days after the @entity23 had their status as suspects over @entity31 's disappearance officially lifted			1
around 120,000 copies were sold before it was withdrawn when the @entity23 won an injunction against the ex-police chief			0
proceedings : mr @entity69 in the court building , where the case against mr @entity29 is being heard anger : mr @entity69 claims the allegations made it harder to search for his daughter , who vanished in 2007 @entity15 tv station @entity103 , also being sued by the @entity23 along with mr @entity29 's book publishers , broadcast a controversial documentary based on the book in april 2009			1
former family liaison officer @entity107 told the court : ' what is in the book is based on our investigation and contains the professional and personal opinions of @entity29 as a police officer			0
' everything that is there can be found in the case files			0
' contradicting earlier claims by the @entity23 ' family and friends that mr @entity29 's book had hindered their search for their daughter by turning the @entity15 public against them , he added : ' the flow of information continued to come in regularly			2
' neither this book or any other book affected the flow of information			0
' @entity132 , head of a national police unit tasked with investigating organised crime , including kidnappings , said mr @entity29 's conclusion @entity31 was dead was an idea accepted early on by her parents			2
he insisted @entity1 was the driving force behind a failed july 2007 search for @entity31 by controversial ex-south @entity142 detective @entity141 , who claimed to have invented a machine which could locate a body if provided with a dna sample			1
@entity132 said the reservations he felt over mr @entity141 were shared by colleagues about sniffer dogs supplied by @entity150 police which went on to smell the ' scent of death ' in the @entity23 ' holiday apartment and place a huge question mark over the hypothesis @entity31 was kidnapped			1
the performance of the dogs was later called into question after they also reacted to remains at @entity162 orphanage in @entity163 , which were later found to be animal bones			0
battle : mr @entity69 and his family are still looking for @entity31 , who was aged three when she disappeared mr @entity132 told the court : ' the @entity23 convinced us we should bring in the south @entity142 man with his equipment			1
' we did n't want to place any obstacles in the way and so the investigating officers eventually allowed it			0
' it was during this part of the investigation our @entity150 colleagues said there was a team made up of dogs and their handlers that could help us to find out where the child could be buried			0
' it was from then on that the @entity186 police division decided to allow the dogs to come and the idea of @entity31 's death began to form and things took another direction			1
' i know the suggestion of the dogs was not accepted lightly			0
' we had no experience of it in @entity15 and the cost was another factor			0
' retired police officer @entity197 , now a tv commentator , described the @entity10 investigation as one of the ' most complex and well - investigated cases ' he had had ever seen and called mr @entity29 ' competent			0
' he insisted the @entity202 - the @entity23 and the friends dining with them at a tapas bar near their apartment the night @entity31 disappeared - should have had their phones tapped because of ' inconsistencies ' in their statements			2
attacking the ongoing @entity211 - funded @entity210 investigation into @entity31 's disappearance , called @entity213 , he told the court : ' there 's a prophetic and dogmatic vision behind it			1
' these detectives are only putting forward the hypothesis of abduction			0
' judge @entity221 stopped lawyers on both sides asking mr @entity29 's former police colleagues what they thought about his conclusions on @entity31 and her parents in his book because they were ' opinions ' and not ' facts			2
' victim : @entity31 's disappearance sparked a worldwide police search , but she has not yet been found couple : @entity32 and @entity1 say they were extremely distressed by mr @entity29 's book , published in 2008 she waved the book in her hand as she demanded to know from @entity107 : ' the back cover says it contains exclusive revelations			1
' what 's new in the book that 's not in the police files ? ' told by mr @entity107 , ' nothing ' , she replied : ' ok , so then i have to conclude this is misleading advertising			0
' another defence witness , mr @entity29 's ex-number two @entity247 , was bizarrely dismissed after being asked just one question			0
the police chief , still a serving officer despite being convicted in january of torturing a crime suspect and receiving a two and a half suspended jail sentence , has previously claimed he believes the @entity23 concealed @entity31 's body			1
he was overheard on a video link muttering : ' what am i doing here ? ' before being sent away after admitting he had only read the final two pages of mr @entity29 's book			0
