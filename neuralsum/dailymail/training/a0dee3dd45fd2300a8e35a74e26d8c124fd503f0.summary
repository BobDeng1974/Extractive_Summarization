by @entity0 prisoners approaching the end of their sentences are being offered @entity5 lessons to stop them reoffending once freed			1
@entity6 has formed a partnership with @entity9 open prison on the @entity10 in @entity11			1
inmates deemed suitable are sent on courses , including for @entity14 and forklift trucks , at the company 's base in @entity18 or at the jail , and are predominantly classroom - based			1
prisoners approaching the end of their sentences at @entity9 open prison on the @entity10 , @entity11 , pictured , are being offered hgv lessons to stop them reoffending once freed funding for the lessons comes from charitable donations , including from the @entity27 and the @entity28 - and has to be paid back once jobs are found			1
sheppey residents criticised the scheme , with one describing it as a ‘ slap in the face of the ordinary hard - working person ’			1
however , @entity36 , senior operations manager at @entity6 , said the aim was to help offenders into jobs on the outside to stop them reoffending			2
he said once offenders pass their tests and get jobs , they have to pay back the money to help another inmate rehabilitate			2
mr @entity36 said : ' it 's not a freebie			0
these are n't free driving lessons for personal use			1
once their term is up , they are given a small amount of money and told basically to get on with it			0
' what we have done is put a programme in place to help get them trained , get a cv together and help them get a job			0
' a person is less likely to reoffend if they are in a full - time job			0
the money used to train them will be paid back to help the next person rehabilitate			0
' it 's like a conveyor belt system			0
' we are trying to help people to stop them re-offending as there are often prisoners who leave jail with a small amount of money , no family and no job and are back in prison in a week			1
' funding for the lessons comes from charitable donations , including from the @entity27 and the @entity28 - and has to be paid back once jobs are found since the scheme started in january , half of around the 30 people who have been trained have found employment , mr @entity36 added			1
he said helping train suitable prisoners with @entity5 licences is helping to plug the shortfall of up to 100,000 drivers in the logistics industry			2
the charity , @entity97 , welcomed steps that help prisoners gain a job and rehabilitate themselves			2
a spokesman said : ' what victims want more than anything else is not to be a victim in the first place and for the criminal not to do it again			0
' schemes that are proven to genuinely cut the chances of someone reoffending help to achieve that , such as the restorative justice work we do where a criminal has to meet their victim			0
' helping a prisoner to get a job after they 've served their time is also a helpful step in their rehabilitation			0
