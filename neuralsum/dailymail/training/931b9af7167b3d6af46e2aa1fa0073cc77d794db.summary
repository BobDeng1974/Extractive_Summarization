when @entity1 takes the field at @entity3 on saturday he will do so conceding almost five stone in weight and eight inches in height to his gargantuan opposite man @entity7			1
if it were a boxing match , it would n’t have got past the weigh in			0
but they say rugby is a game for all shapes and sizes and , despite an apparently inexorable upward trend favouring brawn over brain , it is testament to the sport that @entity1 will start with at least a fighting chance against one of the most powerful sportsmen on earth			1
@entity1 ( right ) runs the ball during @entity25 's training session at @entity26 on thursday all @entity28 centre @entity7 ( second right ) gets stuck in during his side 's training session in @entity31 @entity32 ! how @entity33 measures up against the @entity28 ' monster centre @entity7 @entity1 ( left ) has a quiet chat with his fellow centre @entity36 ahead of saturday 's game at @entity3 ‘ i 've never been big , so i 'm used to it , ’ said the 5ft7in inside centre when asked if he was concerned about the size differential between him and his opponent			1
‘ you just get in there			0
it 's not all about size			0
you have to understand your opposite number , what he 's going to do and be ready for that			1
‘ i know @entity7 has a great off - load and things like that , but you 've also got to keep an eye on ( @entity58 ) @entity57 and then ( @entity60 ) @entity59			2
@entity1 ( left ) faces the daunting task of trying to stop the huge , cross-code @entity28 ( right ) at @entity3 on saturday @entity7 ( right ) was in the thick of the action during @entity28 's 74 - 6 victory over the @entity65 last saturday @entity7 collects an offload from @entity67 to cross for the first of his two tries against the @entity65 @entity71 races away from @entity72 during @entity25 's 36 - 13 loss to the @entity28 in june ‘ you have to be excited			1
i ’m excited to play against the best players in the world			0
that 's why i 'm here			0
i do n't want to be messing around , i want to play the best in the world			0
i 'm looking forward to it			0
’ @entity1 ’s excitement at the prospect of going toe - to - toe with a man who , aside from a stellar career in both rugby codes , has also gone undefeated in six professional boxing bouts , is especially admirable considering his last international appearance			2
substituted after 40 minutes of @entity25 ’s third @entity91 thumping in @entity93 in june , a fifth @entity91 cap looked a long way off for the 12st8in centre			1
but his superb @entity97 form for @entity98 this season has seen him make an irresistible case for a recall alongside @entity102 in @entity25 ’s midfield			1
a conversation with @entity105 at the end of the tour , when the former @entity109 rugby league star vowed to return a better player , also left a mark on the @entity25 coach			1
‘ there was no big meeting , no massive talk , ’ @entity1 , 25 , said			2
‘ it was a little bit of a chat at the airport			0
the last test did n't go as well as we ’d have liked , for the team and for me as an individual			0
‘ i 'm not stupid enough to think 40 minutes is going to put me back			1
every single player has their ups and downs in their career , but it 's how you come back			0
that 's what i tried to do when i got back to @entity98			2
’ @entity105 conceded on thursday that he expected the @entity28 to target the diminutive former rugby league star			1
but @entity1 appeared utterly unconcerned by the prospect			2
with superb feet and a willingness to play flat to the gain line , @entity1 has flourished in @entity98 ’s midfield alongside @entity137 and @entity138			1
on saturday , with the @entity140 pair of @entity102 and @entity141 completing @entity25 ’s midfield , he will be charged with reproducing that form			1
@entity1 will have to be on his toes at @entity98 now that superstar @entity145 has arrived at the @entity146 soon , he will also need to prove himself against another hulking opponent in new @entity98 team - mate @entity145 , who has known from his league days as a 14 - year - old			1
@entity1 feigned ignorance when asked what he thought about the prospect of the current international rugby league player of the year wanting to take his shirt at club and international level by answering ‘ does he ? ’ with a broad grin			1
but , following a tough baptism in union which saw him finish last season struggling for first - team action at @entity98 , @entity1 knows better than most how difficult the cross-code switch can be			2
‘ the transition is n't easy , ’ he said			0
‘ it takes people different timescales in how they fit in			0
‘ i can understand the shapes rugby union run now , it looks similar to league , but it 's a completely different game			2
there 's a lot to learn before you can really excel			0
i 'm sure @entity145 will do that			0
