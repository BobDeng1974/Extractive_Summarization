when @entity1 could n't find work in @entity3 , she searched past city limits , ending up with a part - time restaurant job 20 miles away , which takes at least two hours to get to using public transportation			1
@entity8 has to take two buses to her job at a suburban mall in @entity12 , @entity13 , using separate city and suburban bus systems			1
for many city residents with limited skills and education , @entity3 is an employment desert , having lost tens of thousands of blue - collar jobs in manufacturing cutbacks and service jobs as the population dwindled			1
mayor @entity24 , however , has made rebuilding the population and creating jobs and training programs some of @entity3 's priorities now that the city is out of bankruptcy			1
@entity8 says there are too few jobs in the city but those jobs may not materialize quickly enough for @entity8 and others who 've found local prospects slim , and the lack of reliable public transit is an obstacle that 's driving even those who 've stuck it out to consider leaving			1
' there no jobs in @entity3 , ' said @entity8 , 26 , waiting in 16 - degree temperatures for the first of two buses to the @entity60 mall in @entity12 , where she makes $ 8.25 an hour as a bistro hostess			1
' if it 's no jobs , then why stay in the city ? ' said @entity8			1
' there is nothing here			0
' the city 's unemployment rate , which hit 25 per cent in 2009 , stood at 14.9 per cent last year , state figures show , compared to a regional rate below 7 per cent			2
many residents without cars — about 40 per cent of @entity3 's population , according to federal figures — often enter low - paying retail or sales positions far outside the city			1
the number of @entity3 residents who work outside the city is nearly double the number with jobs inside the city , according to statistics from regional planning organization @entity84 ( @entity86 )			1
more than 228,000 @entity3 residents commute beyond the city limits , while only about 115,000 people who live in @entity3 also work in the city , @entity84 says			1
inner - ring suburbs are the primary work destinations for @entity3 residents			1
but several thousand , like @entity8 , make longer odysseys			0
' the city of @entity3 has been on hard times for a while , and there are n't as many jobs in the city as i 'm sure the city will like , ' said @entity102 , @entity84 's deputy executive director			2
' mayor @entity24 is working on that			2
but for right now , there are a lot of jobs — and some of the lower paying jobs — in the suburbs that people from the city are trying to fill , ' @entity102 said			0
part of the problem is getting there			0
the @entity3 , built largely on the auto ownership dream , tore up its streetcar system in the 1950s			0
the city today has no subway or tram system outside a 3 - mile elevated loop that serves only downtown			0
and while construction has begun on a light rail , it will connect only the thriving downtown and @entity127 areas , not reach into the hardest - hit neighborhoods			0
as its financial state worsened , @entity3 had reduced bus service on some routes and eliminated others			2
@entity3 mayor @entity24 has said that his priorities for @entity3 are rebuilding the population and creating jobs and training programs			1
the population of @entity3 has decreased to 680,000 from 1.8million in the 1950s a regional transportation system — separate from @entity3 's and primarily serving the suburbs — also has struggled with funding			1
newspapers across the @entity144 reported on 56 - year - old @entity145 earlier this month , who said he walked 21 miles to and from his factory job in the suburbs after his car failed and bus service was cut back			2
the @entity3 received a $ 350,000 from a @entity153 campaign and a new @entity154 after his plight received national media attention			2
the bus routes still provide a cobbled - together lifeline for those like @entity8 , who said she 'd prefer to work in @entity3			1
her desire to one day move closer to where the jobs are collides with @entity24 's hopes to spur growth in the city , whose population has fallen to 680,000 from a high of 1.8million in the 1950s			1
' there are a lot of people trying to rely on public transportation to get them to a job , ' @entity102 said			2
' what you tend to see is ... people move out along with the jobs			0
it 's that movement of households			0
' @entity24 has said @entity3 is working on training programs to prepare residents for skilled jobs in the city			1
@entity145 , 56 , was highlighted earlier this month as a @entity3 who worked outside the city			0
he walked 21 miles to and from work every day because he could n't afford a car after a @entity153 site was set up for @entity145 , people from around the world raised more than $ 350,000 for him and he was eventually given a new @entity154 the fire department will help high school students receive paramedic and firefighting certifications , and the police department is working on a similar program			0
the mayor said half the jobs on an entertainment complex and hockey arena , most initially construction work , will go to city residents			2
' it helps a lot if we can get the jobs located nearby , ' said @entity24 , who also announced earlier this year that the city would get 80 new buses and launch a mobile app for the system			2
one new business , @entity214 , is working with the city on bus times to accommodate employee schedules , said owner @entity218			0

@entity229 's new @entity228 program is also working to create jobs for residents , according to the @entity232			0
the company has created a model for worker retraining programs that helps structurally unemployed workers learn new skills			0
@entity214 ( pictured ) is working with the city 's public transportation services to accommodate employees			1

@entity3 resident @entity1 , 26 , has to take two separate bus systems to get to her $ 8.25 - an - hour job in a suburb 20 miles from her home
for many residents with limited skills and education , @entity3 is lacking jobs
many residents , like @entity8 , travel miles outside the city for work
but lack of public transportation in metro - @entity3 makes for long commutes
mayor @entity24 said he has made rebuilding the city 's population and creating jobs and training programs priority
