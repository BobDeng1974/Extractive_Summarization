@entity0 will take a glorious trip down memory lane next week to ensure he is in the right frame of mind for this year ’s @entity5 at @entity6			1
the 35 - year - old @entity7 has added the @entity8 at @entity9 to his schedule and so will warm up for this year ’s match at the venue where he holed the winning putt in 2010			1
‘ i ’ve got so many happy memories there , ’ he said			2
‘ i also won the @entity8 at @entity9 in 2010 as well as enjoying my time at the @entity5 , so it will certainly get the juices flowing a bit			1
happy return : @entity0 sealed a home win for @entity21 at @entity9 in 2010 and will play there again getting into the swing : @entity0 hopes to find his best form at the course ahead of @entity6 ' my thinking is that i want to know the state of my game			1
i do n’t want to take a week off and be thinking : “ what if ? ” i want to be sharp because you know by tuesday at @entity6 you are playing for your place in the starting line - up			2
’ @entity0 made it into the side via automatic qualifying by the skin of his teeth over @entity39 to create a record he is justifiably proud about			1
‘ i ’m the only man to play in the last four @entity41 without needing a wildcard pick , so i will give myself a pat on the back for that , ’ he said			1
‘ it certainly makes a difference to make it off my own efforts , even if the margin was tiny			2
there ’s more pressure if you ’re a wildcard , although it never seems to do @entity55 any harm ! ‘ but it has been an amazing qualifying period for me , for so many reasons			2
off the course , i got married when it started last september and it has ended with me becoming a parent			2
i won the @entity63 in july and now i have got the @entity5 so it has been a brilliant summer			2
’ great year : @entity0 's marriage and first child have added to @entity5 qualification in a good year @entity0 watched @entity39 ’s valiant effort to pip him for the last automatic spot at the @entity70 last week with mixed emotions			1
‘ i thought with four or five holes to go @entity73 was going to make it and i felt for him when he did n’t , ’ he said			0
‘ i was so pleased when he got a pick			0
it would have been devastating to get so close and not make the team , and particularly given it is in @entity80			0
how special to play in a @entity5 in your home country ? not many players get to experience that			1
i know i wo n’t			0
’ @entity0 took last week off for the birth of his first child and mum @entity86 and daughter @entity88 are doing well			1
understandably , he had the air of a distracted man for the first two rounds of the @entity93 here and was well down the field at halfway			2
‘ i guess it ’s not too surprising i ’ve not been at the races and it has been one long physical letdown , ’ he said			0
with little chance now of qualifying for the @entity101 finale in @entity102 that starts on thursday , @entity0 will seek to recapture his form in @entity8 the following week			1
as for the @entity5 , he could not help but reflect he has packed an awful lot into his three appearances to date			0
‘ i ’ve certainly ridden that @entity5 rollercoaster , ’ he smiled			0
‘ i have experienced all the emotions the contest can throw up			0
i ’ve hit the first and last shot , i ’ve won on both sides of the @entity111 , and i ’ve been on a losing side			0
’ @entity114 @entity113 : @entity0 and @entity115 celebrate after @entity116 and will play together again at @entity6 @entity0 was n’t at his formidable match play best and contributed little to the @entity116 miracle in 2012 but is determined things will be different this time			1
‘ i ’m ready to go to @entity6 and enjoy it , and that ’s not always the case with the @entity5 , ’ he said			0
‘ you can get too wrapped up with the pressure			0
i did n’t enjoy it last time because i was washed up mentally , having played too much in the build - up			0
’ @entity21 captain @entity127 told @entity128 in july we will see the celebrated pairing of @entity131 and ‘ @entity132 ’ at some point , even if the friendship of @entity0 and @entity135 has been strained for the past year			1
@entity115 has been involved in an ugly legal wrangle with his former management group @entity137 , who also look after @entity0 , and the latter has felt caught in the middle			1
@entity0 himself will now be leaving @entity137 at the end of the year , albeit on more amicable terms , and it would come as no surprise if he and @entity135 start rebuilding bridges			1
and where better to start than @entity6 , reviving their awesome combination of old and cutting down some @entity148			0
that would help any friendship along , would n’t it ?			0

@entity0 sank the winning putt during the @entity153 in @entity8
@entity7 will play in @entity155 at @entity9
@entity0 is the only man to qualify for the last four @entity41
@entity127 likely to pair @entity0 with countryman @entity115
