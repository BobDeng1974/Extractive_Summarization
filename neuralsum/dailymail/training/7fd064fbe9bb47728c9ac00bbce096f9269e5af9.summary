speaking at the it conference @entity8 in @entity9 on monday , @entity6 said he wants to see a mixture of online passwords with hardware - based identification such as finger print scanning becoming more common			1
@entity6 also said he thinks the technology wo n't become popular until large companies adopt it , but believes @entity18 will lead the way if the technology is added to the @entity21 6			1
@entity3 's chief information security officer @entity6 believes that the end of passwords is nigh			1
speaking at the @entity8 conference in @entity9 , @entity6 said that too many people are using the same passwords across accounts and wants to see a mix of online and physical passwords introduced to increase security the worst passwords of 2012 , including their current ranking and any changes from the 2011 list : 1			1
password ( @entity34 ) 2			0
123456 ( unchanged ) 3			0
12345678 ( unchanged ) 4			0
abc123 ( up 1 ) 5			0
qwerty ( down 1 ) 6			0
monkey ( @entity34 ) 7			0
@entity37 ( up 1 ) 8			0
dragon ( up 2 ) 9			0
111111 ( up 3 ) 10			0
baseball ( up 1 ) source : @entity41 during the keynote speech , @entity6 said : ' passwords , when used ubiquitously everywhere at @entity44 are starting to fail us			1
' users will pick poor passwords and then they 'll reuse them everywhere			2
' that has the effect of reducing the security of their most secure account to the security of the least secure place they visit on the internet			2
' @entity6 wants to see an increase in the amount of physical @entity60 systems being used , such as eye - tracking technology and fingerprint scanners			1
and believes that if @entity18 launches the @entity21 6 with a built - in fingerprint scanner , as is rumoured , the company will lead the way for the technology to become more widespread			1
@entity6 , the chief information security officer from @entity3 , believes passwords are dead and wants to see a mixture of physical technology , such as fingerprint scanners , combined with online passwords			1
he believes that @entity18 will launch the @entity21 6 with fingerprint technology last this year @entity6 said : ' it 's widely rumored that a large technology provider in @entity75 will come out with a phone later this year that has a fingerprint reader on it			1
' ' there is going to be a fingerprint enabled phone on the market later this year			2
not just one , multiple			0
' one organisation that already provides this mix of software and hardware authenticators is @entity6 's own @entity87 ( @entity88 )			1
a @entity88 user will have a @entity90 or token that they chose or was given to them by a vendor such as @entity18			1
this includes fingerprint scanners or a usb memory drive with a password			2
@entity98 come in two forms : identification tokens are unique identifiers that can be connected to your internet accounts			2
once they are connected to your account , they will automatically identify you and log you in			0
the other form of authenticator is authentication tokens			0
these ask you to complete an action such as entering a password , pin , of finger swipe each time you want to access your account			2
this is known as a two - factor authentication that combines ' something you have ' , such as the token , with ' something you know ' , such as a password , or ' something you are ' , such as your fingerprints			0
the system also comes with a browser plug - in that can recognise connected tokens			0
@entity87 ( @entity88 ) is an authentication company that uses a mix of security software and physical authenticator tokens to make accessing online accounts more secure			1
this chart shows how the technology works			2

@entity3 's chief information security officer believes passwords and pins are operating on borrowed time
he wants them *replaced* with a mix of online and physical identification systems such as fingerprint scanning
predicts @entity18 could *kickstart* technology by including it in the @entity146
