' it was a big concern to me			0

@entity21 , uncle of @entity141 suspect brothers , @entity62 and @entity0 believes ' they were just puppets and executors of something of bigger scale ' the brothers are believed to have placed one of the bombs near to a @entity9 store where their mother had been sacked for stealing clothes yesterday the brothers ¿ mother , @entity150 , said the @entity151 once told her that @entity0 was ¿ really an extremist leader and that they were afraid of him ' the @entity153 resident told his nephew that ' he was giving up on everything , struggling with your own shadow ' by whole heartedly turning to @entity158			1
' he had been sort of brainwashing him , ' @entity21 told the @entity159 of @entity160			0
the brothers ' parents told @entity163 they believe their sons were framed and @entity21 said a family acquaintance told him there was an outside influence on @entity22			0
' he said there is someone who brainwashed him , some new convert to @entity116 , ’ ’ @entity21 said			0
“ i would like to stress ( the acquaintance was ) of @entity172 descent			0
’ [ caption last night there were calls for @entity29 to be classified as an ' enemy combatant ' the uncle also speculated that @entity0 ’s younger brother , @entity29 , was manipulated into the bombing plot			1
' @entity29 is just a kid who wanted to have older brother to look up at			0
except for being a murderer , he ’s been a loving brother			0
' ' that so - called radicalization was seeded right here , not in the @entity183 , not in @entity184 , not in @entity185 , which he has nothing to do with , ' @entity21 said			0
the extremist views which @entity0 developed over the course of the past three years caught the attention of @entity184 security officals who asked the @entity151 to question him in 2011 - before he traveled to @entity185 and @entity191 last year			1
the @entity151 are said to have discovered nothing incriminating during their conversations with @entity0			1
however , friends said that @entity0 became increasingly vocal in his views , especially concerning @entity196			2
the @entity197 spoke more of the truth then the @entity199			0
he said the @entity199 was used as an excuse to invade other countries , ' said @entity202 , 18 , a student at @entity203 , which the bombers also attended according to the @entity205			0
and it has been revealed today that @entity0 had direct contact with @entity209 terrorists – and was ‘ monitored ’ by investigators for five years			2
the @entity151 put @entity0 , 26 , under surveillance after receiving an explicit warning from the @entity184 intelligence services			2
rebel : one theory is that @entity0 was inspired by @entity216 , a @entity209 terrorist known as @entity184 's @entity217 @entity216 has recently widened his fight for @entity209 independence to a wider @entity221 agenda but despite apparently telling his mother that @entity0 was an ‘ extremist ’ leader , the @entity151 eventually discounted the possibility that he was a threat			1
yesterday the brothers ’ mother , @entity150 , said the @entity151 once told her that @entity0 was ‘ really an extremist leader and that they were afraid of him ’			1
she added : ‘ he was controlled by the @entity151 for five years			0
they knew what my son was doing			0
they were following every step of his			0
’ and his father , @entity233 , said investigators warned his son : ‘ we know what sites you are on , we know where you are calling , we know everything about you			0
we are checking and watching			0
’ @entity184 's @entity217 @entity216 was believed to be behind the @entity242 bombing in 2010 which killed at least 40 despite all this , the @entity151 found no substantive evidence that he was engaged in terror - related activities though they continued to ‘ monitor his internet use and contacts ’			0
according to an intelligence source , @entity184 remained convinced that @entity0 , an ethnic @entity209 , was in ‘ direct contact ’ with @entity252 militants , most likely based in the strife - torn southern @entity184 region of @entity191 , where he lived for two years with his family prior to moving to the @entity256			1
during a six - month visit to @entity184 last year – a trip @entity256 investigators are investigating – it is understood @entity0 visited @entity191 , which is now regarded as more unstable than @entity185			1
one theory is that @entity0 and @entity29 , who was in thrall to his older brother , may have been ‘ inspired ’ by a rebel leader known as @entity184 ’s @entity217			1
a light beam from a helicopter , top right , aims in the direction of @entity64 , where officials searched for @entity62 on friday @entity62 is apprehended on friday evening after almost 24 - hours on the run following a week of terror in @entity9 @entity216 , like the @entity0 brothers , is an ethnic @entity209 from the war - torn @entity183 that lies between @entity274 and @entity275			2
he has been accused of masterminding some of the worst terrorist atrocities in @entity184 , including suicide bombings carried out by two women on @entity280 ’s metro system in 2010 which killed at least 40			0
significantly , while @entity216 was originally fighting only for @entity209 independence he has more recently embraced a wider jihadist agenda			0
it raises the terrifying prospect of further atrocities being carried out across the globe by disaffected individuals inspired by the jihadist rhetoric of the former @entity209 leaders			0
intriguingly , president @entity290 offered to ‘ provide assistance ’ to the investigation in @entity9 before it was known that there was a @entity209 link to the bombing			0
‘ fighting terrorism is more important than political posturing , ’ said a @entity184 source yesterday			0
‘ if we work together properly and deeply , we have much more chance of defeating those who want to maim and kill			0
