@entity0 has uncovered some surprising features about comet @entity2 as it orbits it in deep space			0
instead of imaging a bright , ice - covered comet , the probe ’s instruments have detected that @entity9 is in fact darker than charcoal in some wavelengths of light			1
and scientists working on @entity0 ’s @entity16 instrument have so far failed to find any large patches of water - ice on @entity9 ’s surface			1
instead of imaging a bright , ice - covered comet , the probe ’s instruments have detected that @entity9 is in fact darker than charcoal ‘ we 're a bit surprised at just how unreflective the comet 's surface is and how little evidence of exposed water - ice it shows , ’ said @entity27 , @entity16 principal investigator at the @entity28 in @entity29			1
scientists had previously believed the comet ’s surface would contain ice because it was too far away for the sun ’s warmth to melt it			1
the lack of ice could suggest that the comet had been in close with our sun , or a different star , at some point during its journey in deep space			1
they also found that the ' coma ' - or atmosphere - around the comet contains of hydrogen and oxygen			1
this is surprising as comas are generally thought to be composed of water vapour and dust			0
@entity16 is now probing the origin , composition and workings of comet @entity9 to gather insights that can not be obtained by either ground - based or @entity66 - orbiting observation			1
it has more than 1,000 times the data - gathering capability of instruments flown a generation ago , yet it weighs less than 9lbs ( 4kg ) and uses just watts of power			0
@entity0 has measured the temperature of the comet and determined that its average surface temperature is about -70 ° @entity74 )			0
although it may seem cold , that is actually 20 to @entity76 ( 36 to 54 ° f ) warmer than predicted for a comet at that distance , suggesting its surface will be quite dusty in addition to being icy			0
' this result is very interesting , since it gives us the first clues on the composition and physical properties of the comet ’s surface , ' says @entity90 principal investigator @entity89 from @entity91 , @entity92			0
this suggests that much of the surface must be dusty , because darker material heats up and emits heat more readily than ice			1
the instrument is one of two full instruments on board @entity0 that are funded by @entity101			0
the agency also provided portions of two other instrument suites			0
another @entity106 contribution aboard the spacecraft is the @entity108 for @entity109 ( @entity110 ) @entity110 is designed to provide data on how gas and dust leave the surface of the nucleus to form the coma and tail that gives comets their intrinsic beauty			0
described as ‘ the sexiest , most fantastic mission ever ’ , @entity0 will spend more than a year analysing the comet to help uncover the secrets to life on @entity66			0
the comet itself is about 2.5 miles ( 4km ) long and orbits the sun every six - and - a - half years			1
it is heading towards the sun , so as it nears the star it will begin to melt more			0
zoom in on the image below to find out where @entity0 is at the moment five sites were identified on @entity134 during the @entity136 meeting held 23 – 24 august			0
the approximate locations of the five regions are marked on these @entity140 narrow - angle camera images taken on 16 august from a distance of about 62 miles ( 100km ) for a sense of scale , the comet is about three times the size of @entity146 and @entity0 is the size of a car with 105ft ( 32 metre ) wings			1
in november , @entity0 will be the first spacecraft to send a probe , dubbed @entity152 , to explore the comet ’s surface			0
the target drop zone for a landing on a comet in deep space will be unveiled on 15 september after weeks of analysis to find the perfect location			1
throughout this year , astronomers have been monitoring the comet using ground - based telescopes , and they will continue to follow the comet on its orbit around the sun until the end of 2015			2
until november , @entity9 is only visible from the southern hemisphere , and it is currently in a patch of the sky where it is camouflaged against the crowded star fields of the @entity173			2
taken on the 14th august , this image was taken from a distance of about 62 miles ( 100km ) from the comet this image of comet @entity178 was taken with the @entity181 's @entity180 on 11 august			2
the central pixel includes @entity0 , now orbiting comet @entity178 , but too small to be shown in the image at more than 500 million km from the sun , the comet is still very faint , so only visible to large professional telescopes , including the @entity181 's @entity180 , or @entity180 , in @entity188			1
images of the comet are taken every two nights on average			2
these are quick snapshot images taken by @entity181 staff to monitor the comet ’s activity , by measuring how its brightness changes over time			2
the latest image reveals the comet is now clearly active , with a dusty coma extending at least 19,000 km from the comet			2
‘ its brightness remains in line with predictions based on ground - based data from previous orbits of @entity210 , reassuring us that the comet should continue to behave according to our expectations up to the @entity152 landing and beyond , ’ @entity203 said in a blog			2
this 3d image of comet @entity9 can be viewed using stereoscopic glasses with red – green / blue filters			1
it was created by merging two images taken last month by the @entity0 probe as it circled around the comet			0

finding made by @entity224 as it took *uv* images of comet @entity9
they expected ice because comet is so far away from the sun 's heat
lack of ice suggests the comet had been close to a sun at some point
the coma around it contains an atmosphere of hydrogen and oxygen
@entity248 zones for a landing on comet will be unveiled on 15 september
