attorney general @entity0 said tuesday that his @entity1 will focus on a ' bias reduction and procedural fairness ' program in the wake of mob riots touched off when a grand jury refused to indict a white police officer for the self - defense killing of a black 18 - year - old who had attacked him			1
the @entity1 , @entity0 said during a six - minute speech , has two separate investigations underway – one into the august 9 shooting of @entity15 at the hands of @entity17 , @entity19 policeman @entity18 , and another into the @entity20			1
' the department 's investigations will continue to be thorough , they will continue to be independent , and they remain ongoing , ' he said			0
' they will be conducted rigorously and in a timely manner			0
' following a night of flame - engulfed stores , looted inventories and first - responders fleeing gunfire , @entity0 said his agency 's chief goal would be to ' restore trust , to rebuild understanding and to restore cooperation between law enforcement and community members			1
' @entity0 said five hours of lawlessness left him ' disappointed that some members of the community resorted to violence rather than respecting what i felt were the truly heartfelt words of @entity59 and the wishes that he expressed about how he wanted his son 's memory to be honored – with nonviolence			1
' the elder @entity15 had said monday afternoon as a grand jury decision seemed near that he wanted his son 's death ' to lead to incredible change , positive change , change that makes the @entity69 region better for everyone			1
' ' hurting others or destroying property is not the answer , ' he said			0
@entity15 , along with the slain teen 's stepfather @entity75 , issued a statement after the ' no - bill ' decision was returned			1
'' while we understand that many others share our pain , we ask that you channel your frustration in ways that will make a positive change , ' they said			0
' we respectfully ask that you please keep your protests peaceful , ' the two added , while asking for a renewed emphasis on the need for law enforcement officers to have body - worn cameras while on patrol			2
' answering violence with violence is not the appropriate reaction , ' they said			0
but hours earlier @entity100 was videotaped towering above a sea of protesters as they realized @entity18 would not face prosecution			0
' burn this b * * * h down ! ' he shouted multiple times			1
@entity0 did not mention that remark			2
on @entity110 , @entity109 deputy press secretary @entity108 told reporters tuesday afternoon en route to @entity113 that president @entity114 and his aides ' are all deeply worried and disappointed – and concerned about the violence , any sort of violence , and that 's why the president went out and spoke about it last night			2
' @entity114 's nine minutes of remarks were played nationally on cable news channels whose split - screen broadcasts juxtaposed his plea for calm with real - time pictures of a city in flames			2
but ' again i would remind you , ' @entity135 said , ' the vast majority of protests in @entity19 and around the country were peaceful and constructive			0
' @entity136 : @entity17 , @entity19 became a war zone on monday night as angry protesters fired shots , set fires , destroyed police cars and looted businesses all night ' a nation of cowards ' : @entity0 famously rendered that judgment about @entity147 ' attitudes toward race , and the @entity17 shooting has put inner - city racial animus back on the front burner in @entity152 , @entity0 pledged to work toward ' isolating the criminal element from peaceful protesters ' in @entity17 and in other communities where @entity156 - @entity147 believe largely - white police forces are stacked against them			1
' the reality is that what we see in @entity17 is not restricted to @entity17 , ' he said			2
' there are other communities around the country that have these same issues that have to be dealt with			0
' @entity0 also praised @entity17 residents who risked their lives to intervene in attempts to stop looters and arsonists on monday			1
they ' are in fact heroes , to my mind , ' he said			0
he also plugged the @entity1 's ' @entity174 ' program , a new effort aiming for ' bias reduction and procedural fairness ' in police departments nationwide			1
' our focus will be national in scope and appeal , ' he pledged .			0

@entity0 , the *outgoing* @entity147 attorney general , *sidestepped* lingering *questions* about whether @entity15 's stepfather set off a night of arson and looting with his ' burn this b * * * h down ! ' screams
instead he praised the late @entity15 's father , who pleaded for calm and said he wanted his son honored with nonviolent protests
@entity0 said he was ' disappointed ' in violent protesters and praised ' heroes ' who tried to intervene when rioters set fires and attacked police
added that @entity1 is focusing on ' bias reduction and procedural fairness ' in the wake of august 's deadly shooting
his only mention of the @entity17 police force was a reminder that the @entity1 is investigating it ' rigorously '
