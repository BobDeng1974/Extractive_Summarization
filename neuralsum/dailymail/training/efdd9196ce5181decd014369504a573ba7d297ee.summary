there 's nothing quite like that first crunch in a fresh , untouched layer of snow			0
and whether its gathering snow balls or making snow angels , a white @entity5 can bring out the playful side in many of us			2
but it seems we 're not the only ones who take pleasure in a snow day			0
a recent study found that playing in the snow is also the favourite past - time of small birds			2
researchers have long wondered by redpolls ( left ) in @entity23 burrow through snow ( right )			1
now , one researcher from the @entity26 claims it is simple because they want to have fun like the rest of us professor @entity31 at the @entity26 spent two years watching a flock of about 150 redpolls			1
between november 2012 and the following february 2013 , the birds created at least 252 cavities and short tunnels in the snow in @entity23 , according to a study published in @entity39			1
professor @entity31 told the @entity41 that he had always wondered why these birds dug small tunnels and trenches when there was no food burned beneath the snow			1
the birds did n't require any shelter , and they were also unlikely to be bathing , as they were already clean			1
playtime : between november 2012 and the following february 2013 , the birds created at least 252 cavities and short tunnels in the snow in @entity23 mystery : professor @entity31 said he had always wondered why these birds dug small tunnels and trenches ( pictured ) when there was no food burned beneath the snow family fun : the scientists said that when one bird tunnels with gusto , all its friends and family will stop what they are doing to tunnel too , suggesting it is a social activity			1
pictured are example of redpoll tunnels instead , he came to the conclusion that the birds were simply enjoying playing in the snow			0
he added that when one bird tunnels with gusto , all its friends and family will stop what they are doing to tunnel too , suggesting it is a social activity			2
' play is defined as behaviour with no immediate function , so in that sense , yes , it is ' just ' play , ' professor @entity31 continued			0
he said that the playful behaviour may have its roots in birds farther north who tunnel to stay warm in insulated pockets of snow in the @entity93 tundra			1
in the @entity95 , the snow rarely thaws , but in @entity23 , it can develop an icy crust			2
professor @entity31 noted that redpolls in @entity23 do not burrow at night , suggesting they do not need it to keep warm			2
the playful behaviour of redpolls ( pictured ) in @entity23 may have its roots in birds who live farther north			1
scientists believe these northern creatures tunnel to stay warm in insulated pockets of snow in the @entity93 golden - winged warblers that live in the mountains of eastern @entity109 were spotted fleeing their breeding grounds ahead of the arrival of the powerful supercell storm two days before a storm hit @entity109 that spawned 84 tornadoes and killed 35 people earlier this year , there was a mass exodus of birds			1
golden - winged warblers that live in the mountains of eastern @entity109 were spotted fleeing their breeding grounds ahead of the arrival of the powerful supercell storm			0
and the discovery was made by accident while researchers were testing whether the warblers - which weigh less than two small coins - could carry geolocators on their backs			0
it turned out they could			0
with a big storm brewing , the birds were seen taking off from their breeding ground , where they had only just arrived , as part of an unplanned migratory event			0
the birds were alerted when the storm was 560 miles ( 900km ) away , causing them to flee to @entity137 before making the return trip once the storm had passed			0
overall , the warblers travelled 930 miles ( 1,500 km ) in just five days to avoid the deadly storms .			0

the playful birds have been spotted *digging* through the snow in @entity23
there is no food beneath the snow , and they do n't require shelter there
scientists say it may just be a fun , social activity in which all get involved
the researchers from the @entity26 believe redpolls may have picked up the behaviour from their northern *counterparts* in the @entity93
