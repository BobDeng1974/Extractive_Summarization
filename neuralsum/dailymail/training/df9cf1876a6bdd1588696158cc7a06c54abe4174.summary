looking for love : when @entity8 snowboarder @entity7 fired up @entity9 on her phone she was disappointed to find that few of her fellow athletes had caught on to the 21st century dating tool miss @entity7 wrote on her @entity27 feed : ' it seems so far that not many olympians use tinder ...			1
just wan na match with the @entity32 bobsled team			0
' the @entity33 began this weekend in @entity34 , on south - west @entity37 's @entity36 coast , with thousands of fit , young and energetic men and women arriving from all corners of the world			0
the winter and summer games provide one of the few occasions in the sporting calendar where athletes of all disciplines mingle - and when the competition heats up , hormones begin to bubble over			0
a record 150,000 condoms were handed out during @entity54 's @entity53 two years ago - 15 each for the duration of the event - and countless tales of raunchy post competition liaisons spilled out into the public eye			0
yes or no ? @entity9 is a location - based dating app that lets users browse for prospective partners nearby through profiles on the service			1
users choose yes or no , and if there 's a mutual match the app lets them know fun - loving : @entity7 in action on the slopes , left , and joyously waving to the crowds at @entity34 @entity9 was n't launched in time for @entity74 , but its gay equivalent @entity77 made headlines after crashing almost immediately when athletes began arriving at the @entity80 en masse			1
so it 's no surprise that @entity84 was looking forward to some off - piste action with her fellow athletes in the days leading up to @entity87			0
' ca n't wait to tinder in the @entity3 village in @entity34 , ' she tweeted last month			2
miss @entity7 's tweet of january 31 love interests : @entity7 is hoping to bump into @entity91 ( left ) and @entity92 ( centre ) from the @entity32 bobsleigh team hanging out : @entity7 , right , with fellow @entity97 team members ( from left ) @entity95 , @entity98 and @entity99 but despite her initial disappointment , miss @entity7 's chances of meeting a match online have got a boost after her tweet was picked up by the @entity106 newspaper which runs for the course of the @entity6 and is handed out to athletes			1
' my tinder tweet made the @entity3 village daily			2
hopefully it brings me more matches and closer to the @entity32 ! ' she joked			0
and the story , first reported in @entity115 , has a happy ending , for it seems that @entity84 eventually found what she was looking for			0
she tweeted earlier tonight : ' seriously tinder is on form here in @entity34 hahahaha ! ! '			0

@entity7 disappointed to fire up @entity9 and find few athletes using it
the *smart* phone app allows users to find dates based on their location
@entity3 athletes are notorious for *promiscuous* *post-competition* activities
