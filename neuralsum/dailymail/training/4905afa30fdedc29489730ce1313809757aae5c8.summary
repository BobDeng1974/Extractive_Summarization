by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 20:03 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 20:03 est , 30 january 2014 overseas investment in @entity5 fell by 77 per cent last year as @entity6 retained its position as the most attractive country in @entity9 for foreign business			2
a report by the @entity12 showed just £ 3.5billion of foreign money went into @entity5 in 2013 – the lowest amount for 27 years			2
by comparison , foreign investors spent £ 32billion in @entity6			0
this will inevitably add further fuel to ongoing accusations that the @entity5 economy has been woefully mismanaged by @entity22 president @entity21			2
' dislikes the rich ' : socialist president @entity21 's economic policies appear to have led to a staggering 77 per cent reduction in the amount of foreign investment in @entity5 , the eurozone 's second - largest economy the @entity29 , who released the estimated figures on the eve of a trip by mr @entity21 to the @entity6 , said that this vast reduction came as foreign investment in the @entity36 as a whole increased			1
the @entity6 was the ninth most popular destination for foreign investment last year – and the best in @entity9			1
investment in @entity42 soared 392 per cent to £ 19.6billion in 2013 , while in @entity43 it rose by 37 per cent to £ 22.4billion			0
the increasingly dire performance by @entity5 , which is the @entity46 ’s second largest economy , is a cause of huge concern for neighbours including @entity6			0
other new figures released this week show @entity5 ’s unemployment and poverty rates soaring to new highs			2
despite the mr @entity21 ’s highly publicised ‘ promise ’ that he would get the jobless figures down in 2013 , the number rose by 10,200 in december			1
it now stands at 11.1 per cent , or well over 3.3 million – a figure which rises to almost 5 million if those in part - time temporary jobs are taken into consideration			0
@entity62 split : mr @entity21 has just effectively ' fired ' his first lady , @entity63 , after being caught out travelling to a @entity64 love nest on the back of a moped to meet his lover , the actress @entity69 meanwhile , a damning new survey shows that the poverty rate in @entity5 is at 14 per cent – the highest for 17 years			1
researchers from social policy consultants @entity72 found that 8.7 million @entity5 people live below the poverty line			0
the figures are particularly embarrassing for mr @entity21 becomes he claims to be a radical left winger who ‘ dislikes the rich ’ and is committed to helping the poor			1
the @entity22 ’s disastrous economic policies have been accompanied by regular polls which prove he is the most unpopular president in the recent history of @entity5			0
he has offered a ‘ @entity89 ’ to businesses , offering tax cuts in return for firms creating more jobs			0
but mr @entity21 , who will meet prime minister @entity90 on friday , is rapidly losing credibility among voters , not just because of his policies but because of his hugely embarrassing personal life			1
he has just effectively ‘ fired ’ his first lady , @entity63 , after being caught out travelling to a @entity64 love nest on the back of a moped to meet his lover , the actress @entity69			0
