by @entity0 @entity3 casually after they were handed lengthy jail terms , these are the five men who killed a prominent critic of the @entity6 on @entity8 's birthday			1
the men were convicted of gunning down the @entity10 in the lobby of her @entity13 apartment block eight years ago			2
her death caused international outrage and allegations that the @entity18 authorities were involved			1
but @entity18 's hardline government has denied any role			2
it followed a trial last month which did not reveal who had masterminded the @entity18 journalist 's murder			1
@entity10 , an investigative reporter who uncovered state corruption and rights abuses , especially in @entity37 , died at the age of 48 on october 7 , 2006 , president @entity8 's 54th birthday			1
judge @entity40 agreed to the prosecutors ' request to order life imprisonment for @entity44 , found guilty of pulling the trigger , and his uncle @entity46 , who organised the logistics			0
the other three received 12 , 14 and 20 years			0
@entity10 was one of nearly two dozen journalists murdered in @entity18 since 2000 , but her case attracted special attention because of the brutality of the contract - style killing and the failure of the authorities - even now , after nearly eight years and several trials - to identify who ordered the assassination			1
@entity6 critics and rights campaigners say the murder symbolises the weakness of the rule of law in @entity18			0
the murder of reporter @entity10 ( left ) happened on @entity18 president @entity8 's 54th birthday			1
@entity8 is pictured ( right ) @entity67 ( centre left ) and @entity44 ( centre right ) sit in the defendant 's cage @entity72 , centre , and @entity46 , right , were convicted of the murder of journalist @entity10 ' i will be satisfied only when the person or people who ordered this will be sentenced , ' said @entity10 's son @entity78			1
her newspaper , the independent @entity79 , is still running its own investigation into the killing			0
' for as long as the name of the mastermind is not known , there can be no talk of revealing the truth , ' said its spokeswoman , @entity87			0
' today 's sentencing is important , but only a step			0
they are the lowest level in this criminal chain , which must still be revealed and punished			0

at an earlier trial in 2009 , a different jury embarrassed state prosecutors by acquitting three of the five defendants			0
another ex-policeman was separately convicted and sentenced to 11 years in a penal colony , but his trial also failed to reveal the person or people behind the murder			2
@entity8 condemned the murder at the time but infuriated @entity10 's supporters by saying her ability to influence @entity18 politics had been ' extremely insignificant ' and her killing had caused greater damage to @entity18 's image than her writing			1
the former @entity126 spy has clamped down on dissent since returning to the @entity6 for his third term in a 2012 election marked by mass protests			0
@entity131 , a prominent human rights campaigner who worked with @entity10 , voiced a widespread belief in @entity18 that people in the higher echelons of power might have played a role in the killing			1
