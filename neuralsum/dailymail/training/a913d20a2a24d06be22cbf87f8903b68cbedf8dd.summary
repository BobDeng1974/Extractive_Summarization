by @entity0 the banks of the @entity2 in @entity3 became awash with colour today as the @entity5 got underway			1
and for once it was n't the women 's fashions brightening up the scene but the men 's			2
male rowers and spectators wore bright blazers in a rainbow of shades			1
here come the boys in blazers : club members show off their natty numbers @entity20 : these orange trimmed blazers are certainly eye - catching badge of honour : rowers wear blazers in different colours to show which club or country they compete for dressed to impress : of course it 's not just the men who wear stylish blazers dress code : men in the @entity35 's enclosure must wear lounge suits , jackets or blazers with flannels and a tie or cravat in the pink : this spectator has a cap and blazer matching their boat the preppy jackets come in stripes and checks with an array of different colours			1
but while they may make the wearer look dapper , on closer inspection some can be somewhat stained and threadbare			0
this is because , according to the oarsmen , they refuse to get them dry cleaned in order to follow the age old tradition of wearing the coffee and beer stains of the past as a ' badge of honour '			2
lengthy issue : women in the @entity69 are told that they will not be admitted if their skirts do not have a hemline below the knee on all week : men arrive for the first day of the races what it 's all about : the men 's viii from @entity79 , @entity80 lift their boat out of the water after winning their @entity84 race picnic with a view : spectators enjoy the races in the sunshine this also explains why some appear to not quite fit , as they have been passed down a family through the generations regardless of if they are the same size			1
the stains , missing buttons and patches are all part of what makes the blazers a part of the regatta 's 175 - year history			2
rowers wear blazers in different colours to show which club or country they compete for			1
in some cases they are also a clue to the wearer 's success on the water due to the insignia , such as stripes on the cuffs			0
the men will be showing off their style for the rest of the week as the regatta continues until sunday			0
during this time , thousands of people will attend to watch more than 200 races			0
still in style : the event is proud of its 175 - year - old traditions leisurely afternoon for some : spectators lounge along the riverbank as the rowers by go job done : rowers carry their oars back from the water , left , while this dog wants to join in the fun , right competition : there will be more than 200 races over the course of the regatta @entity143 @entity142 : the event is a key part of the summer sporting calendar last bastion of class : those headed to the @entity35 's enclosure must stick to the rules on dress and use of mobiles snapped snapping : a viewer takes a picture of the scene the regatta has been held ever year since 1839 - except during the two @entity159			1
the event is often described as the last bastion of class in the @entity142 summer season as it has stuck to its quintessential @entity165 traditions			0
a dress code is strictly enforced while more recently , rules have been adopted on the use of mobile phones			2
the guidelines for the @entity35 's enclosure stipulate that men must wear lounge suits , jackets or blazers with flannels and a tie or cravat			1
meanwhile women are told that they should wear dresses or suits and will not be admitted if their skirts do not have a hemline below the knee			1
hats are ' customary ' but not mandatory			0
the dress codes states that no - one wearing shorts or jeans will be admitted			0
the @entity5 website adds : ' members are particularly asked to bring the dress code to the attention of their guests , to ensure that the standards are maintained and to avoid the possibility of embarrassment of a @entity198 being refused admission			1
' set for a fun day : when it comes to women 's wear , hats are welcomed but are not mandatory ready to row : rowers carry their boat from the storage tents historic sight : the event has been held in @entity207 for more than a century they explain that use of mobile phones is also strictly prohibited ' to minimise the inconvenience and annoyance caused to others '			1
they write : ' those seen making or receiving calls on their mobile phones will be reminded of this ban by @entity219 and @entity220 , asked to stop and a note taken of their @entity223 number			0
this will allow identification of the responsible member			0
if the request to stop is ignored , or if the same person is caught a second time , then the person will be escorted out of the enclosure and their badge forfeited			0
' while they could n't take selfies or update their @entity237 statuses , today 's guests did have the @entity142 weather on their side so they could enjoy picnics on the river banks as the rowers raced by .			2
