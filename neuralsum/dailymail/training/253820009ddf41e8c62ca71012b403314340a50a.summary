by @entity0 published : 11:58 est , 6 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:05 est , 6 december 2013 a little boy will be able to eat chocolate again this @entity5 after he received a new kidney from his father			1
@entity8 , three , will be able to tuck into the treat after recovering from a rare condition which made it dangerous for him to eat it			1
@entity8 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , was born with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease – @entity17 - but has now recovered thanks to a kidney transplant			1
@entity8 , three , has autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease which causes cysts to form of the kidneys damaging the tissue			1
in severe cases , it leads to kidney failure his condition stopped him from eating a variety of foods including chocolate , cheese and yoghurt			1
this is because they contain minerals , such as phosphate , which his failing kidneys were unable to clear from his body			1
too much phosphate can cause the parathyroid gland to secrete a hormone which causes calcium to be leached out of the bones causing rickets , poor growth and bone fractures			1
@entity8 's mother , @entity48 , 24 , said : ‘ it was difficult , because he was so poorly and the only foods he wanted to eat were foods that would harm him			1
' we are going all out this @entity5 and i just can not wait			2
‘ to be able to watch will really enjoy himself , and tuck into his favourite treats is going to be fantastic			0
@entity8 had to have a very restricted diet as his failing kidneys were not able to filter excess minerals from his body			1
he is now able to eat normally after receiving a new kidney from his father @entity8 's parents , @entity63 and @entity64 , were told before his birth that he might have kidney problems as a scan showed that the organs were slightly enlarged ‘ i 've already put the decorations up and i ca n't wait to spoil @entity70 and his brother			1
‘ before the op will could barely eat anything - it was hard , because he used to get given chocolate all the time and could n't eat it			1
but now , he loves the stuff			0
‘ it 's great to see him tucking into his favourite food now and really enjoying it			0
‘ this @entity5 will be the first year he eats a @entity5 dinner too – we ca n't wait			0
’ autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is a rare genetic childhood condition which causes cysts to grow in the kidneys and damage them			1
symptoms of @entity17 include high blood pressure , kidney disease and liver disease			1
in the most severe cases , children with the condition do not survive for more than a few weeks			1
children with less severe @entity17 sometimes lose all of their kidney function by their teens			1
if this happens , they will need either dialysis or a transplant			0
it is estimated that one in 20,000 babies are born with the condition			1
children with @entity17 are often unable to eat a wide range of foods , including chocolate , because their failing kidneys are unable to filter excess minerals from their bodies			1
of particular concern are phosphate - rich foods because excess phosphate can build up in the blood of people with kidney failure			1
this is serious because it causes the parathyroid gland to secrete a hormone caused @entity120 which causes calcium to be leached out of bones			0
this can cause rickets , poor growth and bone fractures			0
source : @entity128 ms @entity48 and partner @entity64 , 32 , discovered their oldest son might have a kidney condition at their 23 week scan			1
ms @entity48 said : ‘ we knew @entity70 may be ill very early on , as scans showed that his kidneys were slightly enlarged			2
‘ but none of the doctors could say for sure , and there was a nine out of ten chance that he would be ok			0
‘ when he was born , he seemed fine and the initial tests were clear , so we thought we were lucky			2
’ but at just 14 hours old , little @entity70 took a turn for the worse			0
ms @entity48 said : ‘ i was trying to feed him and all of a sudden he went blue and started to shake			0
‘ we were then told that he had low blood sugar and had some sort of kidney problem			2
he was hooked up to loads of machines and you could actually feel his kidneys through his stomach			2
‘ our lives suddenly took a dramatic turn and it soon became clear that he was n't well at all			0
’ @entity8 was transferred to @entity157 where his parents were told the shocking news that their son had @entity17 , and he may need a kidney transplant			1
the potentially fatal condition causes cysts to appear in the kidneys damaging them			1
it can also cause damage to the liver			0
ms @entity48 said : ‘ we just could n't believe it			0
‘ i 'd been told that going to @entity157 would be the last resort , and then here we were			0
everything was just crashing around me			0
’ luckily , doctors were able to stabilise @entity8 , increasing his kidney function			1
@entity8 ( pictured with his parents , @entity63 and @entity64 , and his brother , @entity175 ) was diagnosed with @entity17 after he turned blue and started shaking when he was just a few hours old @entity8 ( pictured after his transplant ) received a new kidney when he was just two years old			1
both of his parents were eligible to donate but his mother , @entity63 , became pregnant with his brother his mother said : ‘ eventually we were discharged and for eight months everything was fine			0
‘ but after one of his check - ups we were told he was getting worse again			2
‘ we rushed back to hospital and @entity70 was transferred to the pre-transplant clinic			0
‘ i looked at my little baby and just could n't believe he needed such a huge operation			0
’ ms @entity48 said : ' it was a very scary time			0
to watch them both go through surgery was just petrifying			0
i had to say goodbye to @entity70 on my own as @entity64 was in theatre and it was awful ' immediately , his parents began investigations to determine whether they could donate their own kidneys to their little boy			1
both were a match , but ms @entity48 became pregnant with the couple 's second child , @entity175 , so it was decided that her partner should donate			0
in october last year , when @entity70 was just two years old , the toddler and his father underwent surgery			2
ms @entity48 said : ‘ it was a very scary time			0
to watch them both go through surgery was just petrifying			0
‘ i had to say goodbye to @entity70 on my own as @entity64 was in theatre and it was awful			1
i gave him a little kiss and a cuddle - i was so emotional			2
‘ it was all a bit of a blur to be honest but they both did so well , i 'm so proud of them			0
’ the transplant was a success and @entity8 was out of hospital in ten days , but due to follow up tests over @entity5 , the family never got to celebrate			1
ms @entity48 said : ‘ we were in hospital on christmas eve , so the festive period was n't too fun for us last year			0
‘ for the first six months after the operation i was always on edge , worried that something would go wrong again			0
‘ but this year , it 's going to be different - i ca n't wait to spoil @entity70 after all he 's been through			2
‘ there 's a chance that he might be lactose intolerant but we 'll find a way around it , i ca n't deprive him of chocolate again			2
’ ms @entity48 says this year she is determined to spoil @entity8 at @entity5 to make up for everything he has been through @entity237 , chairman of the @entity238 , said : ‘ it 's a rare inherited condition , inherited from parents who are carriers			1
‘ @entity17 is a severe disease but about 8 in 10 babies who survive the first four weeks of life are still alive at five years old			2
research continues into finding new therapies but is hampered by lack of funding by government			0
‘ sufferers of it feel unwell , have tiredness			0
@entity253 is also a big problem and very high blood pressure can bring risk of heart disease and a stroke			2
‘ they may also need dialysis treatment as the kidneys stop doing its job removing toxins from the blood			2

@entity8 was born with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease - it causes cysts to develop on the kidneys damaging the tissue
he was not able to eat chocolate as the condition meant his kidneys were unable to filter the excess phosphate in it from his body
he has now recovered after receiving a new kidney from his father , @entity64
