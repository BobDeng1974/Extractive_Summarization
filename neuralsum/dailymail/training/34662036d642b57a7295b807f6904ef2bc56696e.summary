@entity5 - july 2014 - present ‘ the situation became clear to me before i went on loan to @entity28 [ in january ] , ’ he said			1
‘ right from when i was 17 , i was getting those 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 - plus games a season until i hit a stumbling block			0
‘ that ’s when the alarm bells rang			0
before that , i had a chance to move from the club – because i just want to keep my career moving – but i was advised i did n’t need to do that			0
‘ it all unravelled in front of my eyes , and certain things did n’t make sense in terms of what certain people had said to me , all i ask for is honesty , and i did n’t get that			0
‘ since i left to go on loan to @entity28 , it ’s been about me again			1
i ’d never rule anything out , but it ’s just been about getting out there and playing consistently without the thought process of what @entity2 think or whether i ’m going back there			1

‘ to get that taste of playing for my country was great			0
there ’s nothing better than playing in front of a full house at @entity88			0
it ’s what every boy dreams of			0
