by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd the @entity1 is just edging out the @entity2 as the best in the world - according to the number of players left from each league in the @entity8			2
@entity10 's top division had been storming ahead in these stakes but @entity13 's progression to the semi finals has helped put the @entity1 on top heading into the last four			0
@entity16 's @entity15 trails behind with 14 representatives while @entity19 's win over @entity20 has helped boost the @entity22 numbers to 10			0
scroll down to see @entity2 players flop in @entity24 key : there might be less @entity2 players left but the likes of @entity28 have been key vital : @entity31 's @entity30 will be @entity24 's main man in their attacking play following @entity35 's injury clash : @entity37 helped push fellow @entity2 man @entity38 out of the @entity8 two steps from glory : @entity42 's @entity41 has been ever - present for @entity43 @entity44 are still the top club around - with a total of nine men helped by their six starters in the @entity49 side , but the likes of @entity31 and @entity42 are not far behind			1
most surprisingly , @entity52 runners up @entity53 are the second - best represented with five players - all in @entity56 's @entity19 squad only 20 sides now have two or more players left in the @entity8 , and the @entity2 boasts four of those : @entity31 , @entity59 , @entity42 and @entity60			1
but while there might be more @entity49 - owned players left - those from @entity64 clubs still have some of the biggest roles to play			2
@entity28 came off the bench to inspire @entity19 's penalty shootout win against @entity20 - and @entity30 and @entity69 will be the key men in @entity24 's attack with @entity35 ruled out			0
in terms of the most successful final for the @entity64 sides , a @entity24 v @entity19 showpiece in the @entity75 could see as many as 12 @entity2 players on show - if the @entity52 fielded both @entity28 and @entity60 's @entity79			1
@entity81 players flop in @entity24 ( 1/4 finals ) impact : @entity84 was a substitute this time but scored for @entity13 in the last - 16 @entity2 v @entity1 : @entity24 come up against @entity13 in @entity85 @entity1 v @entity2 : and @entity19 face @entity43 in @entity87 competitors : @entity89 tries to tackle @entity90 in the last round as @entity43 faced @entity92			0
