by @entity0 published : 08:17 est , 16 january 2013 updated : 08:22 est , 16 january 2013 just hours after @entity3 designer @entity2 stunned onlookers at @entity5 by including automatic rifles in his catwalk show , another label has carried out a similiar attention - grabbing stunt - this time with machetes			1
the @entity11 presentation , which took place in @entity13 yesterday , saw models with outfits specially moderated to carry large knives and machetes take to the runway			1
@entity11 , which is headquartered in @entity19 , used @entity21 actor @entity20 as one of the models , and the veteran @entity26 - @entity25 thespian carried 10 knives and two machetes down the catwalk , all of which were tucked into special pockets on his @entity34 denim jacket			1
@entity26 - @entity25 actor , @entity20 , on the runway at @entity11 carrying two machetes and 10 knives @entity11 , a @entity40 label , specialises in streetwear and uses ' raw ' or untreated denim to create hard - wearing jeans			1
and while the machete - wielding models did sport some denim clothing , many others wore military - style camouflage			1
the brand , which is sold around the world , has worked with a number of famous faces in the past , including actress @entity52 and former @entity54 band member @entity53			0
among the audience yesterday was @entity57 actor in front of an audience that included @entity57 actor , @entity59			2
given that this is not the first controversial use of weaponry in a fashion week show , critics have suggested this is the start of a worrying new trend			2
as designers fight to get heard among the noise , they are coming up with increasingly more shocking ways to grab headlines			0
but as a growing number of street violence incidents , military abuse and mass shootings continue to shock the world , come critics have suggested it is inappropriate for fashion brands to appropriate this violent imagery so literally and to glamourise it for financial gain			0
deadly : the actor 's denim shirt and jeans combo bristled with dangerous weapons martial : other models sported military - inspired camouflage but did n't carry knives or machetes star power : @entity25 actor @entity59 ( left ) attended the @entity13 show , while @entity52 ( right ) has previously modelled for the @entity40 brand @entity97 's show yesterday was shocking from start to finish , with military - inspired pieces worn by models brandishing automatic rifles , and in one instance , carrying what looked like a rocket propelled grenade			1
others sported paramilitary - style balaclavas , while others carried rubber gas masks and had faces streaked with camouflage paint			0
the @entity3 designer 's show also included models daubed with slogan tattoos offering messages such as ' only @entity117 ' and ' life 's a game and it 's not fair '			1
like his models , @entity2 also opted for a military look , appearing at the end of the show dressed in a khaki t - shirt and fatigues			1
knowingly controversial , @entity2 recently hit the headlines after unveiling his new advertising campaign featuring what seemed to be two male twins kissing each other			2
shocking : a heavily tattooed rifle - wielding model on the catwalk during the @entity2 show in @entity5 dangerous : daubed with camouflage paint and tattoos , models at the @entity2 show bristled with weapons chilling : models wearing paramilitary - style balaclavas and rubber gas masks take to the runway at @entity2 the recent round of men 's fashion collections is rapidly drawing to a close with just the @entity147 capital left to show off its style nous			1
but while there have been triumphs ( step forward @entity153 and @entity154 ) , it 's the deluge of sartorial disasters that have made headlines			0
from @entity159 's ludicrous plank headwear to @entity161 's ghastly florals , there has been lots to laugh about but very little to actually wear			0
four by twos made for unusual accessories at @entity159 - but could you get through airport security wearing these ? ludicrous : how many men would be willing to walk down the high street in a knitted scuba hood or supersized mittens like the ones that showed up at @entity173 ? london collections : men had begun well with a star - studded reception at @entity177 followed by critically acclaimed early shows from the likes of @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182			0
but @entity185 member and model @entity184 's plans to turn @entity187 into the ' menswear capital of the world ' took a blow as designs swiftly descended from sublime to silly			0
in the wake of @entity159 's bizarre plank hats and unfinished - looking tunics came @entity173 's super-sized take on knitwear , which saw models appear on the catwalk in what looked like knitted woolly scuba hoods			2
@entity203 so large the men in them could barely walk followed , while poor models had to endure enormous mittens that enlarged their hands to a gigantic size			0
are you sure that 's not womenswear ? models on the catwalk during the @entity161 show during @entity212 skirting the issue : @entity214 looks determined to make the male skirt a strong look for 2013 meanwhile , at the usually excellent @entity219 , men 's and womenswear appeared to have been mixed up , with the @entity221 designer sending models down the catwalk in frilly grey boob tubes			1
frilled shorts and leather minidresses completed the gender - bending collection , all accessorised with ruffled leather knee - high boots			0
not content with getting models to wear prosthetic fangs , the designer created a collection that combined print and pvc to disastrous effect			2
big splashy florals , lashings of pink , cropped trousers and even court shoes were mixed and matched to create a wardrobe straight out of most men 's nightmares			0
not funny : even cheerleader - in - chief , @entity184 , could n't raise a smile for some of the ghastlier offerings nooooo ! meggings make a comeback on the @entity254 catwalk ( left ) as do the reliably hard to wear mustard trousers ( right ) but if @entity187 did n't exactly cover itself in glory , other fashion capitals have n't been far behind			0
at @entity254 , usually a bastion of refined good taste , ' meggings ' or male leggings staged a comeback along with grim mustard yellow trousers , while @entity2 's automatic rifles and balaclavas plumbed new depths of bad taste			2
and now even @entity13 is getting in on the act , courtesy of @entity11 's gratuitous machete - wielding models .			1

@entity40 label @entity11 included the weapon in its @entity274 show
@entity21 actor @entity20 wore two machetes as well as 10 knives down the runway
on monday , designer @entity2 controversially sent models wielding automatic weapons down the catwalk
