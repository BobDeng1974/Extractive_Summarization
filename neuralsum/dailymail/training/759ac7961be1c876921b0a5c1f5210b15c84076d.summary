by @entity0 with @entity4 , the @entity5 and @entity6 among the people and organisations lining up to attack it , news of the government 's badger culling scheme proved controversial to say the least			1
but in one @entity12 village , the culls proved nothing short of disastrous with one animal rights obsessed resident 's poster campaign resulting in a horde of activists descending on the tiny hamlet			1
one young family was even forced to move away after being wrongly linked to the cull by neighbour @entity22 , 67 , and subjected to a barrage of abuse			1
outrage : @entity22 infuriated neighbours when her poster campaign led to a family being driven out noise : her campaign also resulted in rowdy animal rights activists setting up camp in the village but despite the dramatic repercussions , mrs @entity22 is unrepentant and says that as far as she 's concerned , saving badgers is more important than the wellbeing of her neighbours			1
' when we moved in , we were really excited , ' says mrs @entity22 , who moved to the village of @entity39 with her husband eight years ago			1
' we 're here in this lovely valley with woods , trees , open land , this wonderful stream ... it 's just this wonderful environment			2
' i had no idea what to expect when i arrived because i 've never lived in a small village before but i did come in with a lot of enthusiasm			2
' but mrs @entity22 , a self - described ' spokesperson ' for animals soon began to make enemies ; loudly forcing her views on reluctant neighbours			1
' you 've got to be very careful about what you say in a small place like this because you could upset people , ' explains long - term resident , @entity63			0
' when i met @entity22 for the first time , i thought she was a very interfering old lady			2
' mrs @entity22 's animal rights campaign began innocently enough with fairs to raise money for the @entity5 and a local dog show			1
but soon , she incurred the wrath of locals after treating them to her views on people who walk their dogs in fields where pheasants are nesting			0
' i was standing by my house and there was a gentleman up the road and he was walking his dogs in the field , ' remembers the unrepentant mrs @entity22			1
' it was pheasant breeding time and there were youngsters running around , and when i saw him in the field , i thought , " what are you doing ? he ca n't let his dog do that			0
" ' a person walking is bad enough but a dog running around ground nesting birds and chicks is worse			0
[ the dog ] was chasing them around , the pheasants were flying up and i could n't help myself - i did n't think , i just shouted			0
' upset : neighbour @entity101 was left furious after being kept awake by animal rights activists hub : @entity12 was one of the test areas used for the first @entity106 badger cull last summer ' she was regarded rightly or wrongly as a bit of a nutter with regards to animal welfare sort of thing , ' adds neighbour @entity101			1
' but she did take it to extremes			0
to come and live in a rural , small , farming village and then expect people not to do things in the country that they do - why would you want to go and live in the middle of it ? ' when the badger culls were mooted , and mrs @entity124 discovered that a neighbour was planning to take part , her one - woman animal rights campaign took a dangerous turn			1
mrs @entity22 , who had already irritated neighbours by leaving sandwiches and other food in her garden for badgers to eat , created a series of posters ' naming and shaming ' her neighbour which she then attached to her gate and posted around the village			1
' i just could n't believe that he would be part of a badger cull and my natural instinct was to name and shame this person , ' she explains			1
protest : mrs @entity22 joined noisy animal rights activists protesting about the badger cull in the village furious : animal rights activists descended on @entity149 following mrs @entity22 's poster campaign ' people who were shooting badgers did n't want anyone to know and i do n't think that 's right			1
i think they should be prepared to tell people			0
' but when a national newspaper picked up the story , the results were disastrous			0
not only did the neighbour named on her posters receive a deluge of abusive phone calls and emails , he became so scared , he and his family felt they had no option but to move			1
' i could n't believe that someone would be that stupid - to do something like that is unbelievable , ' adds mr @entity101			2
' i know he was getting abusive phonecalls , emails - they had all his contact details			2
' he was that frightened for his family , his wife and children , he moved his family out of the village			1
he was frightened for his family all because @entity22 had put those posters up			1
' mrs @entity22 , however , is unrepentant			1
' i think badgers were a greater priority to me than being part of the community , ' she remembers			2
' i did n't feel bad about the phone calls they were receiving			2
i thought that 's a bit more ammunition			0
i did n't feel any remorse at all			0
' camp : the protesters set up camp in a copse just yards from the villagers , keeping them up most of the night no remorse : despite forcing a family out of the village , mrs @entity22 says she is n't sorry for what she did next , thanks to the publicity generated by mrs @entity22 's poster campaign , a horde of animal rights activists descended on the village , setting up camp in a copse 100 yards from her neighbour 's homes			1
' they had no worry about shining spotlights in all of our windows , ' adds mr @entity101			2
' they did n't usually start until about 2.30 in the morning - just enough to let you get to sleep			0
' they started off with the lights , whistles , air horns			0
i do n't need them out there keeping me awake at night			0
i do n't know what they were trying to achieve			0
but what they did achieve was p * * * sing us off here			0
' ' my response to people complaining about noise in the village would be what about the noise the shooters have been making ? ' sniffs mrs @entity22			1
matters deteriorated further when her neighbours , enraged by her behaviour , responded by calling the police and , in one case , by leaving a bag of manure in her garden			0
' we were spotted by a shooter on his way home and he stopped , reversed and shone a huge light on us , ' explains mrs @entity22			1
support : @entity4 was among celebrities who voiced opposition to badger culling ' i said to him , " you 're an absolute scumbag ! " and he did n't say a word , just drove on			0
the next day i had three bags of dog excrement in my garden			0
i thought , " hmmm , what can i do with this ? " ' her solution was to return it to the person she assumed was responsible - with a nasty note attached			0
' the note said , " if you feel the need to shoot living targets , maybe you ought to join the army , ' she remembers , adding : ' oh , wait , you would probably be too cowardly to be on the other end of a gun			0
' this time , she received a caution from police and , with her relationship with her neighbours damaged beyond repair , plans to leave the village of @entity149 behind			2
' i do n't know what reputation i had to start with but whatever i had was ruined and i certainly have a very bad reputation now , ' she admits			0
neighbour @entity101 adds : do i feel any sympathy for her ? no i do n't - she brought everything on herself			1
' i do n't think think it 'll make any difference whatsoever except that i wo n't be able to say we 've got a nutter living in the village anymore			0
' @entity22 appears on @entity292 , tonight at 8pm on @entity293			2
