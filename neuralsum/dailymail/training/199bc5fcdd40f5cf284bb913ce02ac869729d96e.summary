@entity0 has shot down suggestions he would be willing to abandon @entity2 to replace @entity3 at troubled @entity4			1
and the manager who has revitalised the @entity7 club took a veiled dig at the current @entity10 regime by declaring : ‘ there ’s a lot to be said about being happy at your work and i ’m extremely happy here			1
’ @entity2 chairman @entity17 admitted this week that @entity0 is bound to be attracting covetous glances after leading the club to their first silverware in 19 years with last season ’s @entity21 triumph - but he still expects the former @entity4 midfielder to stay with the @entity2			1
@entity2 manager @entity0 has rejected speculation linking him with the @entity4 job and , despite speculation about a return to @entity28 , @entity0 insisted that he and no 2 @entity29 are perfectly content to remain with a team who are currently one point off second place in the @entity33 and with a @entity21 semi-final to come against @entity35			1

there is still a manager in place at that club , he ’s a friend of mine as well , ’ said the 43 - year - old			2
‘ i have no desire to leave @entity2 at the minute			2
i ’m really enjoying myself here and i feel we have work to finish			0
‘ there ’s a lot to be said about being happy at your work and i ’m extremely happy here			1
‘ the chairman and i speak on a regular basis and we have the same aspirations for the club			0
we have just started something and as good as things are at the minute we still feel there is a lot of improvement to come both on and off the pitch			0
@entity3 has resigned from the post at rangers but might be made to serve his 12 - month notice period ‘ i have a really special relationship with him , a helluva lot of respect for him and i love my job here			2
and @entity29 would echo that as well			0
’ @entity0 , meanwhile , has praised @entity70 for his handling of the racism row with @entity74 ’s @entity73			1
@entity75 international winger @entity73 this week lost his appeal against a seven - match suspension for racially abusing the @entity2 defender during a match at @entity80 in september			2
@entity0 has been impressed by the way @entity70 has refused to let the three - month saga affect the quality of his performances on the pitch			1
and the @entity2 boss called on all parties to ‘ move on ’ after hoping the appeal verdict can draw a line under the affair			1
‘ we ca n’t comprehend how much pressure @entity70 has felt under the scrutiny of it all but he has never allowed his performances to dip , ’ said @entity0			1
@entity0 said he is ' extremely happy ' in his role with @entity2 and is not looking to move ‘ that says a lot for him but he is a confident , bubbly boy and very popular with everybody here			1
he loves his football and is committed to us			0
he loves being at @entity2 , loves his training and is a very popular player			2

‘ now @entity70 and everyone else at the club just wants to move on and talk about football			2
i am delighted we can draw a line under it and now the appeal has been completed i think we can all move on now			0
’ @entity0 also praised @entity70 for the way he handled the fallout from the @entity73 issue in happier events off the pitch , @entity2 this week announced an agreement to wipe the club ’s historic debt of £ 14.5million			1
the club will now press ahead with building a new training ground at @entity124 in time for next season , while plans to move to a new 21,0000 - seater stadium at @entity128 will be revisited			0
despite those developments , @entity17 indicated that money would not be available for transfers in january and @entity0 backed his chairman ’s decision			2
he said : ‘ the debt has hung about the club for so long and this does give us an opportunity to maximise where we are as a club			0
but we reiterate the chairman ’s words – it does n’t mean all of a sudden everything is rosy in the garden and we can start splashing cash everywhere			0
‘ i know what i have to work with			0
we have used the budget well this year and we have to continue to do that			0
