@entity1 photojournalist @entity0 is a man used to the margins of @entity1 culture			1
he has chronicled far - right extremists , the @entity5 and even members of the widely - reviled @entity7			1
now he has created an astonishing visual record of the @entity9 , a white - supremacist organisation known for its white robes with conical hoods			1
he gained the trust of @entity9 members and was able to capture them in candid , unguarded situations that give a unique insight into the world they inhabit			1
the @entity20 - based photographer said that despite their horrific beliefs they came across as normal people in their day - to - day lives			1
he recalled meeting one @entity25 shortly after he started the project that worked as an engineer on a nuclear submarine			1
white power wedding : ' @entity30 ' shows off her custom made @entity9 wedding veil as her fiancé watches on			1
these photographs show the little - seen rituals and home lives of the far - right organisation assembly : klansmen and women during a ' @entity41 ' ( secret meeting )			1
the @entity9 is known for its distinctive white conical hoods he said : ' the majority of the people i 've come across are no different than somebody living next door			1
you 'd only know they were in the @entity9 if they decided to share that with you , had a distinguishing emblem on a t - shirt or a racially - themed tattoo			1
' they live normal lives , some with stronger racial overtones than others			2
there is wealthy and poor , intelligent and unintelligent … just like anywhere else			0
' for a secretive and suspicious group wary of outsiders , earning their trust was no easy task			1
he says he did it by being completely impartial			0
mr @entity0 , who served as a @entity69 in his 20s and later became a bodyguard , said : ' you need to give some of yourself in order to receive something back			1
i spend time with people , i listen to what they have to say and i treat each person as an individual			0
i do n’t have to believe what they believe but whenever i ’m in someone ’s space , i feel i ’m obliged to observe without judgment			0
' over the years , these organisations and the people i encounter have also seen how i work - i ’m respectful of people ’s privacy , i ’m polite and i ’m focused			2
' personality plays a big part as well			0
i ’m far from rigid and i like to think that staying approachable is more comforting and reassuring to people			0
' as well as photos of their costumes and rituals , the photographs show @entity9 members in their kitchens , sharing a joke and day - to - day family life			1
standard : a klansmen and his wife during a flyer drive			0
the purpose of the drive was to bring attention to a proposition before a local court to remove a flag from a state park an @entity111 of a southern - based @entity9 realm takes aim with a pellet gun at a large cockroach ( on the piece of paper just below the clock ) while his wife and goddaughter try to avoid getting struck by a possible ricochet			1
note the noose tattoo running down his back candidates wishing to join the @entity127 in a naturalisation ritual , where they become a citizen of the ' @entity131 '			0
it is not unlike becoming a naturalised citizen of the @entity1 , according to the @entity134 members of the group , originally formed by @entity138 veterans in the aftermath of the @entity140 , have committed numerous racially - motivated murders and assaults over the past century			1
they advocate the seperation of the races , claiming interbreeding between ethnicities goes against @entity147 ( religion is a key part of their beliefs )			0
in the 1920s they reaches the peak of their power , with as many as six million members			0
today they are estimated to number between 5 - 8,000			2
one of the group 's most famous crimes was the murder of three @entity1 civil rights ' workers , @entity163 , @entity164 , and @entity165 , who were shot in june 1964 by members of the @entity167 , the @entity169 's @entity168 and the @entity170 located in @entity171 , @entity172			2
the three had been attempting to register @entity173 to vote			0
the @entity174 called its investigation ' @entity176 ' - which was later used as the title for a 1988 film loosely based on the case			2
national director of the @entity9 @entity181 ( centre ) and his family members of a @entity186 - based @entity9 realm joke around at the home of one of their @entity190 officers the pictures show a side of the @entity9 members and their families that the public rarely sees among the others charged with conspiracy in 1967 , seven were convicted			1
none served more than six years in prison			0
the unassuming nature of the pictures has led to accusations that his work gives the klan publicity , a claim he strongly refutes			0
' if a person was finding him / her self wanting to join the @entity9 after viewing my images , one would logically come the conclusion that this is something they supported long before these images came along , ' he said			1
' i prefer to document the @entity9 at home as opposed to the typical imagery that most anyone can get during a public demonstration			2
yes , i ’m trying to show the viewers the way certain people who ’ve adopted such beliefs live - they may drink soda , cook and put family photos on the wall just like the rest of us			2
' i ’ve witnessed just as much verbal hatred in conversations amongst @entity234 members			0
i ’m not trivialising anything ; i ’m showing things exactly how i ’ve observed them			0
' the project is on the @entity9 , which alone should offer enough innuendo as to the back - story			1
my objective is to present a project that ’s been covered a million times before , but in a non-typical and intimate light … no other rhyme or reason			0

the unassuming nature of the pictures has led to accusations that mr @entity0 's work gives the klan publicity , a claim he strongly refutes ' people have the option to turn the page and ignore things that disturb them , it does n’t make it any less real			2
as far as myself , i ’d rather be aware of the things around me			0
' he first attended an infamous @entity9 ' cross burning ' ceremony in 2005 , buts says members find the term offensive			2
he said : ' they prefer “ cross lighting ” as it “ dispels darkness , [ and ] brings truth and freedom to the world ”			0
it bears witness to the light of @entity295 , according to their beliefs			0
' the cross lighting ceremony is held in sacred covenant to people in the @entity9			1
this holds true for the robes that are worn as well			0
' fiery ritual : several members of the @entity305 during a family cookout as they prepare for a cross lighting ceremony klansmen prepare torches by wrapping them in burlap for a cross lighting ceremony domestic life : members of @entity9 during a break at the annual congress surprisingly , given the @entity9 's reputation for violence , mr. @entity0 says he has never encountered any hostility from members , although he admits to one situation where a small group of drunk racist - skinheads were ' getting on ( his ) last nerve ’ during a klan weekend gathering			1
mr @entity0 achieved an extraordinary closeness with @entity9 members			1
did he ever feel too close , too friendly , to them ? ' whenever you ’re granted access into a person ’s intimate space , you ’re establishing a relationship based on trust			2
in my opinion , trust is trust			0
that does n’t suggest i become complacent with my situation to the point of exploitation , nor does it mean i ’m selectively disregarding certain moments to depict something that is not			0
' i do admit i try to offer a balanced perspective as to my experiences within marginalized organisations , such as the @entity9 for example , but to consciously distance myself will in effect ( or could ) create bias			2

@entity0 gained the trust of far - right group to capture their lives in unguarded moments
he also captured some of their most sacred rituals as well as their domestic day - to - day existence
