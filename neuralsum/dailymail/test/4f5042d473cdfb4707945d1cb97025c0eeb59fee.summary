we 've had an ale made from yeast grown in beard hair , a beer that features barley from the @entity6 , and a 67.5 per cent alcohol brew that comes with a warning tag			1
and while the craft beer revolution has seen connoisseurs knock back their interesting ales and small batch brews , news of the latest offering might put off even the biggest of fans			2
promising to make the hardiest of stomachs turn before even a sip is supped , this new craft beer will be brewed from human sewage			1
recycling gone too far ? @entity24 alcohol regulators have approved plans for beer brewed from human waste production of the beer has been approved by alcohol regulators in @entity30 , @entity24 , and will be made from waste gathered by sewage treatment firm @entity32			1
the company will treat the effluent before handing it over to microbrewers who will turn it into a tasty tipple			0
according to a 50 - page report which was handed to alcohol regulators , the sewage would pose ' very low human health risk ' and would be treated to ' very high standards '			1
there will only be ten barrels of beer made and it wo n't be available in shops but there is talk of mass production if the drink proves popular			1
in the report , @entity54 , an assistant director at @entity32 , told regulators it was designed to ' raise awareness of the reusable nature of all water '			1
' by highlighting craft beer , a product @entity30 is known for around the world , the project will seek to engage ... people everywhere in a conversation about water , ' he continued			1
the scheme , which is backed by the @entity68 and @entity69 , is proving to be highly unpopular with state residents			2
according to @entity72 , @entity71 said : ' the water meets drinking water requirements , but does it smell and taste good ? ' @entity75 added : ' there is plenty of clean water in @entity30			2
' let 's let the ground do the purifying as water sinks a hundred or more feet to the water table			2
' do n't use recycled water in alcoholic beverages			0
@entity87 beer brewed by @entity89 's @entity88 which contains 67.5 per cent alcohol			1
