@entity0 does n't believe the success will change him			1
in fact , he said he upheld his commitment to the @entity1 in part to chase down @entity25 for world no. 1			1

' i 'm sure @entity0 's wiped , ' said @entity49 , the par - 3 contest winner at @entity3 last week who finished tied for 12th behind @entity0			1

' @entity0 has had success here the previous two years , finishing ninth in 2013 and 12th last year			1
the @entity1 gave him an invite two years ago when @entity0 was a rising , yet largely unknown 19 - year - old trying to make his way on tour			1
the top - 10 finish , @entity0 said , helped his confidence and status on the @entity59			1
' this tournament helped with job security , ' @entity0 said			2

@entity101 tied for third here in 2000 a week after winning the masters while @entity105 was sixth in 2007			0
only @entity106 is 1985 followed a @entity34 victory with a triumph a week later at the @entity1			2
@entity0 believes he 'll be the same driven , focused competitor he 's always been after winning the major he dreamed of as a child			2
that might be difficult after this week 's spotlight			0
@entity0 got congratulatory tweets from stars like @entity116 's @entity115 and about 200 texts and emails since the victory			0
