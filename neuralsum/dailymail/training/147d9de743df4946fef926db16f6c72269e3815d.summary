by @entity0 published : 09:45 est , 1 january 2014 updated : 12:06 est , 3 january 2014 pump iron : personal trainer @entity3 says lifting weights is the way to burn fat is your @entity8 's resolution to tone up and lose weight ? perhaps you 're planning to join a gym so you can slog for miles on the treadmill or attend low intensity exercise classes like @entity15			1
many people with good intentions do this every year but still struggle to shift stubborn fat			1
so if you really want to get slim in 2014 - and stay that way - author @entity3 recommends ditching endurance - based activities for short bursts of exercise and pumping iron			1
the personal trainer has tried and tested her methods with numerous clients and now her 12 - week fitness programme is available for everyone to follow in the form of her book , @entity32 : @entity33 , published by @entity34 on 2nd january			1
@entity3 's fat loss plan focuses on raising people 's metabolic rate ( the amount of calories your body burns ) using high - intensity cardio , plyometrics and challenging resistance sessions - that all take a maximum of 45 minutes to complete			1
a former ultra-marathon runner herself , @entity3 recommends people forgo long runs and other endurance exercises like swimming if they want to lose weight			1
she writes : ' running , cycling and swimming can be fantastic in small amounts but many people ( including me ) get carried away and keep upping their mileage without realising that their training is at odds with their health / fitness / fatloss goals			1
' she explains how endurance activities cause the body to store energy as fat so it has reserves to get through the miles ahead			1
but with her recommended high intensity exercises - which people can do in their own homes - the body will instead store fuel as glycogen in the muscles			1
she explains : ' how will this get rid of fat on your body ? because of the " after burn effect "			2
you 're going to train so hard your metabolic rate will go through the roof and it will stay high even after you finish training while your body adapts and recovers			0
' this will cause you to burn more fat for 24 - 48 hours after exercising			2
' no need to join a gym : @entity3 's methods are tried and tested and the exercises can be done in your own home @entity3 recommends people follow her 12 - week plan , which involves exercises such as burpees and press ups , alongside eating healthily for optimum weightloss results			1
she 's loathe to call it a ' diet ' and believes calorie counting is not the way forward			0
hence there 's no food plan or recipe suggestions in the @entity32			0
instead she gives readers ' guidelines ' that are ' incredibly effective for reducing body fat , improving energy levels and generally ensuring your body gets what it needs to thrive			0
' this means she recommends eliminating processed sugars ( which are highly fattening ) , limiting diary products ( because ' all the growth hormones and lactose it contains will inhibit your fatloss ' ) and replacing carb - loaded pasta , breads and cereals with vegetables and protein - rich foods such as fish , eggs and lean cuts of meat			2
shape up in 2014 : this excerpt from the @entity32 shows some of the exercises @entity3 recommends to burn fat and tone up a key aspect of @entity3 's programme involves gaining muscle for a more toned and sculpted body			1
but she stresses that her weight - lifting exercises wo n't make women turn into bulky bodybuilders			2
she explains : ' adding muscle not only gives your body a firmer , more attractive shape , it improves athletic performance , reduces injury risk , aids mobility and agility , reduces aches and pains , brings a huge range of health benefits and of course makes you strong			0
' she adds for the women who may have shunned using weights in the past : ' if you are concerned that gaining muscle will make you look too big and bulky , please put that out of your head			0
this is something that tends to worry women more than men , but ladies , i can assure you that getting big muscles is very hard for us to achieve even when we try to			0
' success : @entity168 has dropped nearly a stone and a half after introducing weights into her exercise regime banished her love handles : a view of @entity168 's back reveals her fat loss ... ... while some the side , she 's also a lot slimmer and now has a flat stomach people who have already seen the results of following @entity3 's programme include @entity168 , 26 , from @entity182 , who wanted to get in shape for her wedding			1
she regularly exercised by running but was struggling to shift stubborn areas of fat			0
she had never done weight training before but was willing to try something new in order to fit into her dream wedding dress			0
she said : ' i had tried diets before , and sometimes had lost weight , but it always crawled back on as soon as i stopped dieting			2
the diets were never suitable for the long term			0
no matter how much exercise i did i could n’t seem to shift the weight , even when i ran the @entity200 in 2011 and was running about 30 miles a week in training , i still could n’t get the weight to shift , which was very frustrating as i felt physically very fit			2
' @entity168 said lifting weights and doing short bursts of exercise - never taking up more than half an hour of her day - has made all the difference and she has now lost nearly a stone and a half , dropping from 12st 6lb to 11st 1lb in 12 weeks			1
toned up : @entity210 got rid of the stubborn fat around her stomach , thighs and arms , left , when she reduced her running training in favour of weights and short , intense bursts of exercise @entity220 , 37 , from @entity221 , also found weight lifting a ' revelation ' after following @entity3 's programme			1
she said : ' @entity226 training made me pile on the weight over the past two years			0
plus i just want to feel good , i have much more confidence when i feel fit , strong and healthy			0
' it is a revelation not to be running so many miles , but concentrating on building strength and burning fat			0
' while @entity210 was far from obese at 11st 1lb , she has rid herself of problem fat areas she had around her arms , legs and stomach by following a plan involving weights and now weighs 9st 9lb			0
dropped a dress size : @entity243 , pictured before , left and after , lost 1st 4lbs and 15cm around her tummy after sticking to @entity3 's exercise regime slimmed down : @entity246 went from a size 12 to 8 the @entity32 is published on 2 january another client of @entity3 's , @entity243 , dropped a dress size losing 1st 4lbs and 15cm around her tummy			1
she said : ' it ’s no exaggeration to say that this programme has changed my life			0
i was stuck in a running rut , frustrated and disillusioned with my lack of progress			0
in six months of following the programme i 'm now a size 12 and am starting to develop some lovely muscle definition			0
' i now know exactly how to eat and train for fat loss and love the short intense workouts and lifting heavy weights			2
i feel and look like a different person ! ' meanwhile , @entity246 has lost a total of 9 inches all over her body and 7lbs in weight , dropping from a dress size 12 to an 8			2
