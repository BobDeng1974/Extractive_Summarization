by @entity0 follow @ @entity1 from manager selfies to naked @entity4 to goal - line technology freezing on a winter 's night at @entity7 , the @entity2 promises to be as enthralling as ever this season			1
here , @entity9 takes a look at 10 things we 're likely to see over the coming 10 months ... @entity13 set the pace , then end up off it			1
. @entity18 is fit and firing , @entity17 is smoking hot , the @entity16 winners return on a high and @entity20 is the early - season star			1
yes , the @entity21 will fire themselves to the top of the table and breeze through autumn			0
even in early january @entity9 will run ' 10 reasons why @entity13 can win the @entity2 '			1
and then they will fall away , @entity25 citing injuries and lack of depth as the cause			2
does he still have @entity32 's number , we wonder ? top talent : @entity13 's £ 30million signing @entity20 ( right ) has fans dreaming of the @entity2 title @entity36 is the first manager to leave and second to be appointed ... presuming his seat at @entity38 is filled in the next week , we would n't bet against @entity39 landing the first job which becomes available in the @entity2 – and that will probably be in a fortnight 's time			1
the canny , capped coach is too good to be part of the out - of - work crowd who share the @entity48 exposure between them			0
@entity50 is in charge of that rota , by the way			0
great pedigree : @entity36 has never been relegated during his managerial career @entity57 dances , a lot ... @entity59 may have gone but that just leaves more goals for @entity57			1
he was one of the very few who emerged with a scrap of credit from the @entity16 and – minus the distraction of the brilliant yet often selfish @entity59 – @entity57 can better his 24 goals from last season			2
and that means one thing , let 's dance ... mover and shaker : @entity57 's dance celebration was seen on a regular occurrence last season @entity75 gives us hope ... the boy will be a superstar			1
@entity75 , still only 20 , is the future of @entity81 football and this is the season when us @entity84 followers – regardless of club allegiance – are finally given hope that a better day lies ahead			1
he 's got craft , he 's got graft , he 's got pace , he 's got power			2
@entity91 is gone , but a new @entity93 schemer is ready to man @entity84 's midfield for the next decade			1
boy wonder : @entity75 will be looking to kick - on from an excellent season last term goal - line technology will fail ... yes , this is the season when we debate our first glitch in the thus far flawless system			1
it will come on a rain - swept , wind - lashed winter 's evening at @entity7 with temperatures below zero , visibility low and senses numbed			2
@entity107 would n't fancy that and we 're betting the technology does n't either			0
we only hope @entity110 is commentating on the game ... ground - breaking : @entity2 will use goal - line technology for the first - time ever this season busy : @entity13 goalkeeper @entity114 is notorious for posting ' selfies ' on social media biting @entity117 celebrating @entity118 quitting @entity119 @entity120 on the touchline for all 38 games a competitive @entity84 game @entity125 on a football pitch ( yes , it 's true ) @entity127 drive straight into a training ground @entity129 telling jokes selfies , selfies , selfies ... have you heard of selfies ? no ? well you need to take a good look at yourself , preferably with a camera phone			1
dressing - room selfies , on - the - pitch selfies , out - and - about selfies – and that 's just @entity13 's @entity140			1
this , however , is the season we see our first manager selfie			0
yes , rather than the traditional pre-match handshake , we 're betting @entity120 whips out his mobile and gets a snap of himself and @entity25 which will be posted to @entity119 before the game has even kicked off ... @entity148 survives ( again ) ... he 'll do enough , he always does			0
despite supporter unrest and boardroom murmurings , @entity148 will preserve his employment by winning just enough matches in which his side have ' nullified the opposition 's strengths and exposed their weaknesses ' ( type that into @entity159 , see how many @entity148 quotes you get ) ... standing tall : @entity148 will keep @entity161 up next season , despite his style of football video we have to hit the ground running - @entity148 @entity167 set new record for foreign xis ... we saw it last week in the @entity171 , @entity167 failing to field an @entity81 player from the off			1
and with @entity175 seemingly out of favour and @entity177 never in favour , good old @entity174 could be fighting our corner at the @entity180			0
he 's off to @entity181 in january , however , and the likelihood is that the majority of @entity167 's starting elevens this season will consist entirely of overseas players			2
and this is from the @entity81 champions ...			0
foreign pact : @entity167 boss @entity190 failed to start an @entity81 against @entity13 on sunday peace in the @entity192 ... finally , on a more sombre note , the death of @entity195 fans @entity196 and @entity197 in the @entity199 disaster has united the @entity192			2
a fund set up by a @entity203 fan raised more than £ 30,000 in their memory and former @entity203 goalkeeper @entity206 will represent the club when tributes are paid at @entity209 this weekend			0
the first @entity210 of the season does not come until december , but it should mark the first occasion when the rival supporters applaud each other as a show of respect before the game			0
then , of course , the action on the pitch starts ... touching : @entity203 have raised funds in memory of two @entity195 fans who died during the @entity199 disaster @entity224 drops his pants in the @entity227 dressing - room ... by way of a motivational tactic , it 's probably the best we 've ever come across			0
disillusioned with his @entity234 stars , @entity232 dropped his pants to prove he had the ' balls ' to axe any of them			0
and as good as @entity238 have looked in pre-season , it will only take a couple of defeats for last season 's self - doubt to resurface			2
that could well see @entity232 lose his rag , and his trousers			0
high hopes : new @entity238 boss @entity224 will be aiming to turn around the club 's fortunes			0
