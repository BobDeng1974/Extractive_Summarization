for most people , swimming with whales is a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity - but not if you 've grown up like these children			1
from as young age age four , these kids have grown up alongside the majestic mammals			2
it all began when @entity10 underwater camera operator , @entity11 , moved from the @entity10 to @entity12 to oversee the @entity14 resort with his wife , @entity15			1
pictured : @entity25 ( aged 9 ) and @entity26 ( aged 6 ) swimming with humpback whales it 's there where his three children , @entity25 , aged nine , @entity32 , aged eight and @entity26 , aged six , have had the opportunity to mingle with marine animals in water as shallow as 500m deep			1
while many parents would be reluctant to let their children swim with 40 tonne humpback whales , @entity11 insists that his kids are safe			1
he said : ' the whales are very gentle and accommodating			0
i have noted over the years that they enjoy interacting with children , especially the mothers with young babies of their own			0
' as a resort we specialise in taking people out everyday during the season to swim with the whales			2
' and the whales are as gentle and accommodating as the children are ! here , the marine mammals get close to @entity25 during a swim in 2012 the resort that the @entity11 's operate specialises in taking visitors out to swim with whales , which @entity11 insists is perfectly safe the proud dad would n't dream of putting his kids in danger and insists that the company takes about 500 people out per year to swim ' we are one of the few places in the world where this is permitted , ' he added			1
' i have been an underwater cameraman now for 20 years and would n't dream of placing my children in any danger			0
' we take about 500 people a year to swim with the whales without incident			0
' each year the humpback whales return to waters surrounding @entity75 , where the resort is based , to mate and give birth			1
and @entity11 's three children have been present in the ocean to witness such miraculous events			2
the children have even formed a special bond with two of the whales , which they have nicknamed @entity86 and @entity87			0
each year , the humpback whales return to the waters surrounding @entity75 , where the resort is based , to mate and to give birth when the children are n't playing with the majestic marine mammals , they are often spotted snorkelling in the clear waters			1
pictured : @entity32 ( aged 8 ) swimming on @entity75 time of their lives ! here , @entity32 poses for the camera with a humpback whale behind her in the shallow waters @entity11 said : ' they have been here several times with newborn babies and they particularly enjoy the children 's company			2
' last year @entity87 kept pushing her new baby boy over toward the children encouraging him to interact			0
' we see lots of the same whales every year			0
mothers with newborns tend to visit the same nursery areas to give birth and to nurse			0
' @entity11 and @entity115 pose with their three children : @entity26 , @entity32 and @entity25 outside the resort that they manage in @entity14 , @entity12 the children have even been present for the birthing of whales , so it 's no surprise they 've formed a special bond with two of the mammals these children enjoy spending time engaging in a wide range of water activities , especially @entity25 who loves to go paddleboarding @entity11 adds that while the children love to spend time with the whales , they always keep a safe distance because the babies can be ' clumsy ' but @entity11 and his young charges are always careful to give the mammals their much - needed space			1
' we always maintain a safe distance from the whales not because they are a threat but the babies often only weeks old can be very clumsy and when a five tonne baby gets clumsy you do n't want to be nearby			0

@entity11 and @entity115 are @entity10 *ex-pats* who oversee a resort in @entity12 , where whales often come to mate and swim
their three young children have grown up around the mammals , even forming special bonds with two of them
the kids often swim in the 500m deep water with the humpback whales , which @entity11 insists is completely safe
