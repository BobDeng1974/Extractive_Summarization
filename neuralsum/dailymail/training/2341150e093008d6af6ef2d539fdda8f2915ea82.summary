by @entity0 published : 13:35 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 13:39 est , 4 february 2013 jailed : @entity1 , 36 , subjected the infant to a violent assault , causing numerous fractures and bruises a 36 - year - old electrician was today jailed for 10 years after battering a 31 - day - old baby boy so badly that his heart stopped - which led to a vigilante mob storming the attacker ’s home			1
the tiny baby nearly died after suffering 26 fractured ribs , two broken collarbones , a broken arm and two punctured lungs in what was called a ‘ frenzied , brutal and repeated assault ’ by @entity1 , of @entity19 , @entity20			1
during the december 2011 attack , @entity1 also inflicted a shocking injury to the boy ’s genitalia , @entity21 heard			1
after the attack police had to stop a 100 - strong mob trying to storm the home of @entity1 , who denied assaulting the baby , but was found guilty of grievous bodily harm with intent after a trial			1
doctors resuscitated the baby at @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity20 , after @entity1 brought him in ‘ at the point of death ’ after trying to ‘ cause really serious harm ’ , prosecutors said			1
‘ the baby had collapsed and received urgent life - saving treatment , ’ prosecutor @entity41 said			2
‘ there was both cardiac and pulmonary arrest - no heartbeat and no breathing			0
’ he added : ‘ there was cardiac massage for 10 minutes before the heartbeat returned			0
’ the court heard @entity1 , an @entity54 electrician , was arrested by police and initially admitted causing the injuries , but claimed it was a ‘ misguided ’ attempt to save the baby ’s life			1
treatment : doctors resuscitated the baby at @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity20 , after @entity1 brought him in ' at the point of death ' after trying to ' cause really serious harm ' , prosecutors said he told police he had tried to perform cpr on the baby after noticing he had turned blue and stopped breathing			1
@entity1 claimed the broken arm was caused when he grabbed the baby to restart cpr and the injury to the boy ’s genitals was caused when he knelt on them			1
he also claimed the baby ’s ribs were broken because he probably pushed down too hard on them when giving the cpr			2
but later @entity1 changed his defence after accepting medical evidence that the baby ’s injuries could not have been caused by resuscitation			1
he said the only possible explanation was that the injuries must have been inflicted by the baby ’s mother			2
@entity1 told the jury : ‘ i am still at a loss to know how he ended up in the state he did			2
i have found it very hard to come to terms with everything that happened			0
i have struggled with it			0
‘ i have found it very hard that anyone could do it			0
i still do n’t quite understand			0
’ but mr @entity41 said @entity1 fully intended to cause serious injury to the baby			1
referring to the boy ’s genital injuries , he said : ‘ we suggest the baby weed over him and that he caused that terrible injury to his penis as a result			2
‘ it may be he did try to save the baby and perform @entity68 , but if so it was because only moments before he had almost killed ( the child )			2
’ ' i am still at a loss to know how he ended up in the state he did			0
i have found it very hard to come to terms with everything that happened			0
i have struggled with it			0
i have found it very hard that anyone could do it			0
i still do n’t quite understand ' @entity1 following , the sentencing , @entity126 ’s senior investigating officer , detective chief inspector @entity125 , said : ‘ this was an extremely serious assault on an innocent baby boy			1
‘ in my service i have not seen such extensive injuries on such a young child			0
it was a case that shocked the public and caused considerable community tension in @entity19			2
‘ the infant , who was just 31 days old , suffered incredible trauma , which arguably should have cost him his life or at the very least left him with long - term medical problems			0
‘ however , thanks to the excellent work of the doctors and nurses at @entity36 and @entity144 , he not only survived the attack but is now doing well			1
‘ @entity146 is a bully who took out his anger in the most cowardly way possible when he assaulted this baby and it is satisfying to see that justice has been served			1
’ after the attack police had to restrain a vigilante mob who tried to storm @entity1 ’s home			1
stones and other missiles were thrown at the house , causing damage to the front door and windows			0
it happened when a number of people held a candlelit vigil outside the house , praying for the injured baby who they feared might die			0
some of the mob targeted another house in the neighbourhood where they believed @entity1 was staying			2
the violence and tension led to a local police chief making a public appeal for calm .			0
