trendy teaching methods have abandoned the tradition of imparting knowledge to allow children to chat about what they find interesting , @entity0 claimed today			0
the @entity6 attacked @entity8 exam questions about why @entity10 guru @entity9 is rude and whether or not rapper @entity11 likes eating kangaroo			1
he also ridiculed history lessons using plasticine models to learn about @entity15 , and dismissed group work as ‘ children chatting to each other ’ , which he claimed had seen some schools told to remove chairs and table from classrooms			1
questions : @entity27 exams have include questions about @entity9 ( left ) and rapper @entity11 , @entity0 claimed in a speech on dumbing down in education standards : education secretary @entity0 said warned against the ' sidelining ' of the teacher from the activity of learning in a major speech in central @entity37 , the senior @entity35 said the work of good teachers was under attack on four fronts			1
he dismissed the idea that teaching is a ‘ depressing and demotivating activity ’ in decline and the claim that teaching can not make ‘ any real difference ’			0
he also claimed teachers are under attack from people who think they can not be trusted and need outsiders ‘ at every turn to monitor , police and approve their activities ’			0
but he saved some of his most outspoken criticism for the ‘ sidelining of the teacher from the activity of learning ’			0
mr @entity0 went on : ‘ @entity60 to these teaching methods which have nothing to do with passing on knowledge there has also been an emphasis on teachers having to put their own learning aside so that work is ' relevant ’ to the students			2
‘ this has resulted in the dumbing of educational material down to the level of the child – with gcse @entity27 papers that ask students about @entity11 , or @entity9 – rather than encouraging the child to thirst after the knowledge of the teacher			1
’ in an @entity27 gcse exam in 2011 , students were asked to read an extract from @entity9 's autogibraphy and an article from @entity83 before asking answering questions about the media mogul			1
the questions set by the @entity89 / @entity88 exam board , included : ' @entity9 admits he ’s rude			1
what explanations does he give for his behaviour ? ' in another test , set by the @entity94 exam board , pupils had to read an interview with rapper @entity11 about his favourite food from @entity98			0
asked to ' list four things you learn about @entity11 from the article ' , markers were told to award points for answers including ' he works in the music business ' and ' he did n't like eating kangaroo '			2
celebrity : an @entity110 in 2011 exam paper by the @entity89 / @entity88 exam board included questions about an article on @entity9 rapper : in 2012 gcse @entity27 language students were asked to answer questions about @entity11			1
this is an extract from the guidelines given to markers by the @entity94 exam board @entity0 gave a string of examples of what he called dumbing down in the classroom , including : re-enacting the battle of @entity127 on a field with softballs spending three lessons making castles out of cardboard boxes making plasticine models to learn about @entity15 recreating life on a slave ship by making pupils gather under their desks a-level @entity27 students drawing faces of literary characters on a paper plate gcse @entity27 papers that ask students about @entity11 or @entity9 schools and nurseries told to remove tables and chairs from classrooms @entity149 not allowed to sit still for longer than one minute for every year of their age mr @entity0 called for teachers who ‘ actively pass on knowledge ’ , instead of leaving children to their own devices			1
‘ children naturally learn to talk ; they do not naturally learn to read , or to play the violin , or to carry out long division , ’ he said			2
mr @entity0 said : ‘ it 's the belief that education should not be an activity in which the teacher imparts knowledge to the child but a pursuit - by the child - of what it finds interesting			0
’ educational thinkers have repeatedly argued that the importance of teaching should be downgraded , he claimed with classrooms reorganised to reduce the teacher ’s central role			0
‘ all too often , we ’ve seen an over-emphasis on group work – in practice , children chatting to each other - in the belief that is a more productive way to acquire knowledge than attending to an expert			0
‘ some schools have been pressured to fit in with prevailing doctrines , even against their own instincts			0
‘ some nurseries and schools in @entity188 , for example , reported to us that they were told to remove tables and chairs from their classrooms			1
’ teachers were also told not to keep children sitting still for longer than one minute for every year of their lives , even if listening to a story			2
children could not be allowed to tidy up , or be asked to put their coats on , in case it interrupted ‘ child - initiated play ’ , mr @entity0 claimed			0
where teaching is marginalised , inappropriate fun activities are used in place of proper learning , the minister suggested			0
he pointed to a string of examples collected by teacher @entity208 , who uses a blog a series to chronicle ‘ intellectually impoverished ’ schools and the content of history lessons aimed at 11 to 16 - year - olds			2
mr @entity0 said : ‘ they included studying the battle of @entity127 by re-enacting it on a field with softballs , spending three lessons making castles out of cardboard boxes , making plasticine models to represent @entity15 ’s main aims as @entity224 and recreating life on a slave ship by making pupils gather under their desks			1
‘ another teacher records a lesson for a-level @entity27 students in which they were asked to depict literary characters on a paper plate – drawing a face on the plate - and then asked to use stickers to define the character ’s principal traits - pinning the stickers on their clothes and mingling with other students , while they introduce themselves “ in character ”			2
