by @entity0 published : 11:54 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 13:57 est , 13 may 2013 the grandmother of murdered schoolgirl @entity2 today spoke of her ' relief ' after @entity2 admitted murdering her and hiding her body			1
@entity6 , whose son @entity7 was the 12 - year - old 's stepfather , revealed how @entity9 had torn her family apart and called on a judge to ' lock him up forever and throw away the key '			1
@entity9 today pleaded guilty to @entity14 's murder after months of pleading his innocence and insisting the girl 's death was a tragic accident			1
her body was found in the attic of the home in @entity21 , @entity22 that @entity9 shared with @entity14 's biological grandmother @entity23 , a week after the girl went missing in august last year			1
birthday : @entity2 being presented with a celebratory cake by her mother in a family photograph mrs @entity6 , 69 , said : ' obviously it 's a very emotional time for all of the family who are sitting here around the tv , but in a strange way we also feel relief			1
' it says a lot about the man - just when you thought he could n't do anymore to our family , he 's dragged this out over months insisting he was innocent and only now at the very last moment has he put his hands up and admitted what he has done			1
' in a strange way i feel like it had to happen this way - maybe it 's good that a judge and members of the public have had the chance to hear exactly what this sick man has done			1
' maybe it 's good for all of us to have heard the truth in court so that none of this was buried , none of this remains secret			1
close : the murdered 12 - year - old smiling with her mother @entity65 and a younger brother ' it does feel like some sort of closure , it feels like it was the right time			2
now we can get on with grieving for my beloved grand - daughter			2
' the process is n't easy but now we can get on as best as we can			2
' i hope the judge locks him up forever and throws away the key			2
he does n't deserve any more than that			2
' although @entity14 was not biologically related to mrs @entity6 , the pair became ' extremely close ' after her mother @entity65 entered a relationship with @entity82			1
mrs @entity6 , whom @entity14 called ' @entity83 ' , added : ' we all have so many happy times in our minds from years gone by and everywhere you look there are little reminders			1
' i have a pair of small @entity92 trees which @entity14 picked for me two or three years ago , she made me buy them because they were pink and that was her favourite colour			1
' since we lost @entity14 i do n't really go into clothes shops where they sell teenagers ' fashion , it just reminds me of her			1
' she was a real girly - girl , it was all about the clothes and the hair and the nails for @entity14 , so it is very upsetting when i have to walk past those things knowing i could have been buying them for her			1
' you just have to think about the good times which we were lucky enough to have and not dwell on it too much			2
' tragic : @entity14 was killed in august last year by @entity2 , right , who today pleaded guilty to murder in an interview in september before @entity9 's trial , @entity14 's mother @entity117 revealed the horror she felt when police found her daughter 's body			1
seven days after @entity14 was reported missing , ms @entity117 was at a friend 's house when she received a call from a detective breaking the news they had found a corpse in the loft			1
she said : ' i just hit the floor , i looked up and there were eyes everywhere just looking down at me			2
those sorrowful eyes were all around just staring			2
' i just felt sick			1
physically sick , i was vomiting every time i thought about ( the body being in the loft )			1
to know that she was there that whole time			2
' you hate the police for missing her , you hate yourself for not finding her , you hate everyone who has been in the house , everyone who has been near the house			2
' her partner @entity82 , @entity14 's stepfather , refused to believe what the police had said			1
he said : ' i could n’t believe it when they told me , i refused to believe it , i wanted there to have been some mistake			2
' we were praying they would tell us a body had been there for thirty odd years - we were desperate			1
i remember asking them , " are you sure it ’s not a cat or a dog ? " ' adorable : @entity14 pictured as a child ; her family has today been paying tribute to the schoolgirl friendly : @entity14 's step - grandmother has opened up about her relationship with the 12 - year - old the couple revealed they had received prank calls about @entity14 in the days she was missing			1
mr @entity82 said : ' i got a sick prank call to my mobile phone from someone after she ’d been missing for around three days			1
' they ’d just seen my mobile number on the t - shirts we wore for the tv appeals			2
' they were saying “ we ’ve got her and we ’ll tell you where and when you can have her			0
we did n’t know them , they were @entity191			0
' it was just some sick drunken joke			1
the police traced the call and went through their front door somewhere in @entity191			0
' apparently they found a couple of lads sitting around drunk making prank calls			0
' ms @entity117 added : ' it was n’t the only time , we had lots of pranks , or at least false messages			0
' there were people calling saying they had seen her at a bus stop , someone said they has spotted her asleep on a park bench			0
' we had people running around everywhere chasing up messages			0
for people to be sitting there having fun at that time , it just makes you so angry			0
' i ’m still angry now			0
' toddler : @entity14 disappeared from her grandmother 's home in @entity21 , @entity22 she explained how she felt when police were still searching for @entity14			1
' as the days passed , the range of emotions we went through was like nothing i can describe , ' she said			0
' i ’ve tried to tell people , to put my finger on it , but i ca n’t			2
' you feel empty , like you ’re being twisted from the inside			0
all the way from your stomach to your throat			0
' you ca n’t eat , you ca n’t sleep			0
it ’s horrible , i would n’t wish it on my worst enemy			0
' all we could do was wait and waiting is the hardest part , because what else can you do ? but the more you wait the more you know in your heart of hearts that it ’s not going to happen			0
' it ’s the last thing you think about when you go to bed at night and the first thing you think about when you wake up			0
it ’s still that way now			0
' i remember , every day she was missing i ’d wake up , and open my eyes and things felt normal for a second or maybe two			0
but then there was this kick in your stomach when you realised where you were and what was happening			0
' couple : @entity14 's mother @entity65 with her partner @entity82 , whose mother @entity264 has spoken out today she added that her daughter was ' a fighter ' who was mature and independent for her age			1
she said : ' once , you accept what has happened and you try to come to terms with that , you just want to be able to grieve for your child			0
but we have n’t been able to mourn			0
' there ’s so much i do n’t know , and as a parent i ’m supposed to know			0
' i do n’t know if she was scared , i do n’t know if she suffered - i do n’t know if my baby suffered before she died			0
' if i know one thing now though , it ’s this : @entity14 was a fighter			1
whatever happened to her , it would n’t have happened without a struggle			0
she could look after herself			0
' she used to look after her friends , none of them were bullied when @entity14 was around , she knew to stand up when something was wrong			1
' so the one thing i do know , is that whatever happened , she stood up for herself			0
