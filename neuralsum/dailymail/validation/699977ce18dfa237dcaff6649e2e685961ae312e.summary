there were call - ups for three uncapped players and an unexpected recall for @entity4 but they were all overshadowed in @entity7 's @entity6 squad to tour the @entity8 by the return of @entity10			1
nothing seemed less likely than this when @entity10 left @entity7 's @entity14 tour 16 months ago after his public ordeal at the hands of @entity17			2
the road back since he returned home after the first test in @entity22 with a ' stress - related condition ' later diagnosed as situational anxiety has been a long and tortuous one			1
@entity25 batsman @entity10 has been recalled to the @entity6 squad for their upcoming tour @entity10 has completed his recovery from a stress - related condition that stretches back to the ashes in 2013 @entity10 will compete with @entity32 for an opening batting slot alongside @entity34 yet against all the odds and after the key development of working with renowned sports psychologist @entity37 , @entity10 is back and will compete with @entity32 to become @entity34 's opening partner in the three - @entity6 series			1
there will be those who worry about @entity10 's fragility but mental injuries should be treated no differently from physical ones and now he has been given a clean bill of health it is right that the 33 - year - old should be picked			2
@entity32 gets the nod ahead of @entity50 and his emerging county colleague @entity51 , and becomes one of an incredible six @entity53 in the squad after scoring 1,489 championship runs at 67.68 last season			2
@entity57 , another @entity53 , and @entity59 fast bowler @entity58 are the other newcomers			0
@entity57 made the last of his 10 limited - overs appearances for @entity7 six years ago but is a more mature leg - spinning all - rounder and person now at 27			0
@entity4 , who missed out on the @entity64 after a miserable year of form , returns in place of the injured @entity67 , but @entity7 see him more as a no 6 batsman and fourth seamer in test cricket			0
@entity7 hope @entity71 will overcome a side injury to join the tour in time for the second test in @entity75			0
in his absence @entity57 will compete for the no 1 slow - bowling spot with @entity80 's reliable off - spinner @entity78 , who edged out @entity82 's @entity81 for the final place in the squad			0
@entity57 bowls during a training session for the @entity7 performance squad at @entity87 in 2014 @entity58 celebrates taking the wicket of @entity89 batsman @entity50 ( left ) in june 2014 batsmen : ( @entity91 , @entity92 ) @entity34 , 30 , 109 , @entity93 @entity94 , 25 , 14 , @entity95 @entity96 , 25 , 8 , @entity95 @entity97 , 32 , 105 , @entity25 @entity98 , 24 , 3 , @entity99 @entity32 , 27 , 0 , @entity95 @entity100 , 24 , 22 , @entity95 @entity10 , 33 , 49 , @entity25 all - rounders : @entity57 , 27 , 0 , @entity95 @entity4 , 23 , 6 , @entity59 bowlers : @entity103 , 32 , 99 , @entity99 @entity104 , 28 , 74 , @entity105 @entity106 , 26 , 5 , @entity107 @entity108 , 29 , 13 , @entity95 @entity78 , 33 , 1 , @entity80 @entity58 , 25 , 0 , @entity59			1
