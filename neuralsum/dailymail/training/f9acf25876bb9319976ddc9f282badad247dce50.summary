published : 00:10 est , 11 february 2014 @entity1 : 07:03 est , 11 february 2014 free to study : @entity2 is being allowed out of prison after serving just six years of sentence for the murder of @entity2 the drifter convicted for the killing of @entity2 has insisted @entity8 and @entity9 are guilty of her murder , as it was revealed he is being allowed to leave prison to study for a degree			1
@entity14 , 27 , who is serving a 16 year jail sentence for the murder and sexual assault of @entity2 , spoke out as it emerged he is now eligible for day release after serving just six years of his sentence			1
because of the @entity23 legal system @entity14 is entitled to early release as he has served almost half his sentence - and has been a model prisoner with no incidents of misbehaviour during his time in prison , the @entity21 reports			1
in a letter to his lawyer @entity32 , he said : ‘ i want to underline that the people who committed this terrible crime are still free and that the truth has still not emerged and that it will never be found , especially if people continue to listen to false testimony and liars			0
‘ all i have heard is lies and a distortion of the facts especially when it comes to my character			0
the judiciary must seek to establish the truth because that night i did not kill anyone and the people responsible for what happened that tragic night are still free			0
‘ the court still insists that i was guilty of sexual assault but i did not commit that crime and even the autopsy proves that			1
this is a painful episode for me and for @entity2 ’s family			0
i am seen as the ideal guilty person but i had nothing to do with this			2
’ @entity14 was initially convicted under a fast track trial in 2008 and sentenced to 30 years in jail for @entity2 ’s murder and sexual assault but this was later reduced to 16 years on appeal			1
during his trial he admitted being at the murder scene but he insisted he had been in the toilet at the time @entity2 was attacked , and that he emerged to see ‘ someone resembling @entity9 ’ fleeing the scene and ‘ @entity67 outside the house ’ where the murder took place in @entity71 in november 2007			2
@entity73 student @entity2 was found with her throat cut in her bedroom in the central @entity23 city of @entity71			2
@entity2 was found guilty of murder and sexual assault dna tests established @entity14 was at the scene after his fingerprints were found in @entity2 ’s blood and he was also identified from a faeces specimen found in a toilet at the house			1
he told the court that convicted him that he had found @entity2 bleeding to death and then tried to save her by stemming a wound to her neck but then fled as he relaised she was dying			0
last night @entity14 ’s lawyer @entity90 confirmed that @entity14 was now eligible for parole and had been given permission to study at an undisclosed university near @entity71 but he had not yet left prison to take up his place on the course			1
he said : ‘ @entity97 can go out of prison for several hours at a time now and that ’s the law all over @entity23			0
he spends his days studying history			0
@entity9 has been ordered to serve 25 years and @entity8 28 years after a judge upheld their original guilty verdicts for the murder of @entity2 ' he spends some hours with a teacher , we do n’t want to say where he is because he will get swamped by people from all over the world			2
‘ at the moment he ’s not going out			0
but he can if he wants to , he just has to make an application			0
last month an appeal court in @entity112 upheld the original murder convictions on @entity67 and @entity9 and a judge ordered that she serve 28 years while he was given 25 years - although neither sentence has been enforced as a further appeal stage has to be concluded			2
both @entity67 and @entity9 have insisted they are innocent and have blamed @entity14 for the murder with @entity9 saying : ‘ there is no evidence of me or @entity8 at the scene while @entity14 ’s dna is everywhere			1
