once a humble wellington boot brand loved by country bumpkins , @entity0 has risen to become the footwear of choice for a-listers - and it 's all thanks to one man			1
@entity9 , better known to some as mr @entity11 , took the helm as creative director 18 months ago and since then he has given the brand a huge overhaul , introduced trend - led outerwear and ensured his show is one of fashion week 's hottest tickets			1
as @entity0 celebrates the official opening of its first global flagship store at 83 @entity24 in @entity25 today , @entity21 caught up with the brains behind the brand			1
' it demonstrates our commitment to growing the business and maximising the incredible opportunity this great @entity35 brand has			2
' and @entity9 certainly made a statement with the opening event , which saw 28 dancers take over the @entity25 street to perform @entity50			1
paying tribute to the @entity35 capital , the performers arrived in one of the city 's iconic red buses - all sporting coats and boots from the latest @entity60 collection			2
country in the city : the @entity24 store has been designed to resemble a barn and aims to pays homage to the @entity35 countryside within an urban setting dramatic scenes : the opening event saw 28 dancers take over the iconic @entity25 shopping street with a production inspired by @entity72 ’ in the @entity73 just to ensure all eyes were definitely on the store , a free - runner scaled down the side before the production climaxed with a torrent of water spraying down onto @entity24			1
inside , the store - which looks a little like a souped - up hay barn - the decor pays homage to the @entity35 countryside			0
seating areas resemble the traditional farmhouse boot room , with boots displayed against a backdrop of box hedging and green tiles			0
@entity9 , like his wife a fan of all things high - tech , also oversaw the installation of a five - metre led screen that cuts through both floors and plays fashion shows and ad campaigns on a loop			2
how fitting : the event was inspired by @entity102 's famous performance and @entity0 's heritage of protecting from the weather and all terrains making a scene : a freerunner scaled the side of the new store before the production climaxed with a torrent of water spraying down onto @entity24 the grass is greener : seating areas resemble the traditional boot room and the collection is displayed against a backdrop of box hedging ' the design of the store references some classic architectural features and materials that you might traditionally associate with the countryside or the outdoors , but they have been reinvented into an urban context , ' he explained			1
fresh from an evening spent having dinner with @entity130 and his new wife , @entity131 , the 44 - year - old told of his plans to ensure that city shoppers get a truly rural shopping experience			0
' the result of this is that you really experience the merging of the countryside and the city under one roof ; ' he enthuses			0
' it is these two worlds coming together that represent what the new @entity0 brand is all about			1
' branching out : it 's not just about the traditional boot anymore as @entity0 expands its offering with outerwear , knitwear and accessories the new store is an extension of the successful relaunch of the brand , which last appeared on the catwalk in front of a front row that included @entity160 , @entity161 and sir @entity162			1
among the highlights were striking khaki coats with vibrant yellow and turquoise pockets and super-cool colour block outerwear			0
' @entity0 as a brand experience has always been about much more than just the @entity170 boot , ' explained the man behind the re-brand			1
' @entity0 has always represented emotion , fun , adventure and ultimately memorable experiences			2
the introduction of the new categories such as outerwear is an obvious and next step for the brand to express the much - loved brand spirit			2
' top designer he might be , but @entity9 is , at heart , a family man , as the presence of @entity188 , sir @entity162 , and wife @entity11 on the sidelines of the @entity191 / 15 show made plain			2
' the show was a great success for many reasons , ' he mused			0
' it demonstrated clearly that @entity0 can be just as relevant as a spring / summer brand as it is for the winter months			1
' it also clearly expressed the spirit of the brand in an authentic and highly memorable way and lastly it was very well recieved by both the press and the buyers , which is of course key			0
' the support of friends and family is always important - it makes what is a very stressful event much more enjoyable			0
' what a crowd : ( l to @entity212 ) @entity11 , @entity188 , sir @entity162 , @entity213 , @entity160 and @entity214 attend the @entity216 show speaking about the future , he added : ' the brand has undergone a massive transformation in the last 20 months and the ambitions for 2015 are no different			0
' one of the key events in 2015 will be the launch of @entity224 , which will be the brand ’s more technical outdoor collection			0
' @entity224 will offer footwear and outwear to the guy and girl who wants to look amazing in the wilds of the great outdoors , but also need the assurance that the product will perform at the highest level in this environment			0
' founded in 1856 , @entity0 is a @entity35 heritage brand that holds two @entity237 to the @entity238 and the @entity239			2
nevertheless , @entity9 has another queen in mind - the @entity238 of @entity25 's fashion scene to be precise - when it comes to pinpointing the ultimate @entity0 woman			1
' it would have to be the queen of the @entity170 boot , @entity246 , ' said @entity9			1
' i ca n’t think of anyone that wears it better			0
' fashionable pair : he says the support of friends and family is always important and makes what is a very stressful event much more enjoyable			0
