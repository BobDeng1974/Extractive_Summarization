by @entity0 published : 09:42 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 11:56 est , 20 september 2012 a mother - of - four had emergency surgery after her brain became riddled with tapeworm larvae			1
@entity6 - @entity5 , 42 , contracted neurosysticerosis in 2009 , a parasitic disease of the nervous system , after she was infected by pork tapeworm eggs			1
the eggs are spread through food , water , or surfaces that have been contaminated with faeces			2
the tapeworm larvae travelled to her brain where they formed cysts			2
when they started to die they caused an aneurysm the size of a tangerine in miss @entity5 's brain			1
miss @entity26 ( right ) had major brain surgery to treat a brain aneurysm that was most probably caused by tapeworm larvae she was rushed to @entity30 , in south @entity31 , where an @entity32 revealed the dangerously swollen blood vessel			1
surgeons were quick to operate , inserting a shunt in her skull to drain away a build up of fluid			2
she suffered a loss of taste and smell as a result of the rare condition and now suffers from epilepsy and depression			2
miss @entity5 said : ' if it had n’t been for my partner ’s insistence that they keep me in at @entity30 ’s and i see a specialist and had an mri scan they would n’t have found the aneurysm			1
' they removed it straight away and when i was coming around he was talking to my partner and he said i was two weeks away from death			2
it was right at the top of my spine at the back of my brain			2
' @entity64 is very rare in developed countries causing just 24 cases a year in the @entity67 and 1,500 cases in the @entity69 infected : the pork tapeworm larvae forms inside cysts ( sacs ) and can cause tissue inflammation when they die it is contracted by ingesting eggs excreted by a person who has an intestinal tapeworm			1
people living in the same household with a tapeworm carrier have a much higher risk of getting cysticercosis than others			0
it is only spread along a faecal to oral route			0
once ingested , the larvae embed in tissues including the brain , forming cysticerci ( cyst sacs )			0
these can cause seizures and headaches			0
however , confusion , lack of attention to people and surroundings , difficulty with balance and excess fluid around the brain ( called hydrocephalus ) can also occur			0
if left untreated the disease can result in death			1
symptoms can occur months to years after infection , usually when the cysts are in the process of dying , so it 's almost impossible for a patient to know when they picked it up			0
when the parasites die the brain tissue around the cyst can swell			0
the pressure caused by swelling is what causes most of the symptoms			0
infections are generally treated with anti-parasitic drugs in combination with anti-inflammatory drugs			0
surgery is sometimes necessary to treat cysts in certain locations			0
miss @entity5 is now fighting another battle - this time to be moved from her third - floor council flat for fear of having an epileptic fit while alone with her children			1
miss @entity5 , who has been on the housing list to move since 2001 , is currently living in @entity135 , south @entity31 , with her partner , two - year - old son , 12 year - old - son who has @entity140 ’s syndrome , and 10 - year - old daughter			1
miss @entity5 , pictured with her children @entity142 ( left ) , @entity143 and @entity144 , now suffers from epilepsy			1
her neurologist said climbing stairs to her council flat is endangering her health she regularly climbs the three flights of stairs carrying her two - year - old , despite neurologists warning her doing so could cause an epileptic seizure putting herself and her child in danger			1
she said : ' my balance has gone , my sense of smell and taste has gone and my eyesight has got worse			0
' if i carry too much up and down the stairs i can have an epileptic fit			1
i can sometimes feel that i have taken the stairs when i have n’t			2
' my consultant has said if i am moved to a property where i have n’t got any steps she could take me off of the epileptic tablets			0
i ’m alive and i ’m going to see my children grow up , but i have been left by @entity171			0
in a letter to @entity171 , miss @entity5 ’s consultant neurologist described her accommodation as “ unacceptable ” , calling for her to be moved as a “ priority ”			1
a @entity171 spokesman said it recognised the family had been ' dealing with what is clearly a very stressful situation ' and they were working hard to find a suitable property for @entity183			0
recovering : miss @entity5 , pictured after surgery , struggles with her balance and has lost her sense of smell			1
