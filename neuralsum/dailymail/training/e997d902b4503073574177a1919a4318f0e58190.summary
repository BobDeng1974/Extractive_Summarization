the @entity7 decided last year to stop the use of headgear in male bouts , citing medical experts who said it would help reduce concussions			1
the organisation said medical studies showed wearing headgear diffused blows to the head and allowed boxers to sustain more head shots - and potential brain damage - for longer periods of time			1
the bout today was stopped due to the injury on @entity26 's face @entity40 boxing team leader @entity39 said he has only heard positive comments about the move , which will not affect female fighters and younger boxers			1
but its critics include @entity48 pro @entity47 , who said last year : ' they need the protection headguards give at this stage of their careers			2
i get paid to get hit in the head			2
' today , south @entity56 super-heavyweight @entity55 guaranteed at least a bronze medal for @entity40 after pummelling @entity59 's @entity58 to defeat in @entity34			1
@entity60 clubbed @entity58 to the canvas four times and forced five standing counts before the referee had seen enough and waved off the contest in the dying seconds			2
it was an emphatic performance from the @entity69 bronze medallist who will face @entity71 's @entity70 for a place in the final later this week			1
@entity74 : blood covers the face of @entity77 of @entity78 during his men 's middleweight boxing fight against @entity81 of @entity82 at the @entity1 halt : @entity78 's @entity77 looks down after his fight was stopped due to injury following their men 's boxing welterweight preliminaries round bout @entity60 said : ‘ that 's one more down and two more to go			0
i 've fought him twice before and i knew he 'd come forward having a go so i knew what i needed to do			0
‘ obviously i want to go in and finish him off , but i do n't want to go in and catch a shot on the way in so had to stay switched on and watch out for the big hook to the jaw			0
’ @entity98 's flyweight firebrand @entity97 also guaranteed a medal after beating @entity101 's @entity100 via a unanimous decision			1
it was another confident performance from @entity104 who had already beaten world number one @entity105 and @entity40 's @entity69 bronze medallist @entity107			1
winner : @entity59 's @entity109 , with blood on his face , celebrates his victory over @entity113 of @entity114 pummelled : @entity116 's @entity115 bleeds in his match against @entity114 's @entity113 in the @entity118 of 32 at the @entity33 @entity104 boxed in a much more controlled manner , mindful of a cut he sustained above his left eye in the first round			0
@entity104 said : ‘ that was the toughest fight i 've had so far and i knew i just had to hold it in and especially when i got the cut			0
‘ i 'd like to think i can cope with the pressure , i definitely feel like i 'm getting closer and there 's no reason that gold should n't be mine			0
’ @entity132 's @entity131 failed to book a semi-final meeting with @entity104 when he was outpointed by @entity114 's @entity134 in the quarter - finals			2

@entity152 took an early lead in the contest but struggled to repel her opponent 's busy challenge in the three remaining rounds and came up short			0
two judges scored the bout a draw and the third found in @entity151 ' favour , and @entity152 had no complaints with the verdict			0
@entity152 said : ‘ i think the nervous energy got to me a bit but i 'm an experienced athlete and there 's no excuses			0
