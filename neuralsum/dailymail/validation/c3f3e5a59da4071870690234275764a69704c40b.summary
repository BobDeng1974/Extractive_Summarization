dining in a social setting can be one of life 's finest pleasures , where the wine flows as freely as the conversation			2
however , certain foods can leave you on a collision course with culinary faux pas where , at best , you 're left feeling awkward and , at worst , said dish ends up covering you or your companions			2
just ask @entity12 , who probably never wants to see a bacon sandwich again after photos of the @entity16 leader doing battle with a particularly gristly rasher were widely ridiculed			2
@entity28 says : ' nothing can put one off a fellow dining companion more than seeing them messily tackle what ’s on their plate			1
' we now see politicians , tv masterchefs and competing dinner guests badly eat their victuals so perhaps now , if it is not too late , i give them ( and you ) my guide on how to best tuck in to some of the trickiest foods to tackle			1
' @entity61 if served as a first course , rather than an accompaniment vegetable , these are eaten with the hands and dipped into the hollandaise sauce			2
rules of etiquette : never double - dip asparagus ... unless you have your own personal pot of sauce brits will eat these with the left hand ( leaving the right hand free of grease , ready to shake hands or pick up a wine glass , for example ) ; there are some cultures where eating with the left hand is not the done thing , in this case , they may eat the asparagus with the right hand			1
( not many know the left - hand rule today			2
) you may double - dip in the sauce so long as it is your own portion			2
banana if in doubt , go for the banana , says @entity28 : the fruit is easy to unwrap with a knife and fork fruit is served as part of the dessert course ( dessert was traditionally the fruit course at the end of the meal , whereas today people confuse it with the sweet course )			1
at state banquets , such as the recent one for @entity108 at @entity109 , fruit is still served as a palate cleanser			2
a banana is always the easiest fruit to pick			1
cut both ends off with dessert cutlery ( very sharp ) , slice down the skin to unwrap , and then cut off slices and eat with a fork and knife			1
@entity119 the @entity120 tend to consume caviar from the small pad of flesh between the thumb and the forefinger ( again , on the left hand )			2
this , however , looks beyond pretentious in a social setting and is thus best avoided			2
instead , scoop a small bit on to your plate and use a thin piece of toast or a blini to consume			1
one - way ticket to inelegance : if corn on the cob is offered , say no.			0
. if it 's served , then just chow down corn on the @entity140 the little prongs you often get given are naff – especially the solid silver ones ( a rare instance where plastic would be preferably , but not by much )			0
hosts really should n’t serve corn this way unless it ’s a barbecue ( and a pretty feral one at that )			0
if you get offered it , politely decline			0
if you get served it , with naff prongs , then pick it up and gnaw away			1
everyone else will be in the same inelegant boat as you			0
@entity160 ( @entity161 ) special clamps are often used to hold the shell in place whilst a small , two - pronged fork is held in the right hand and used to pierce and scoop the fleshy meat from within			1
tricky little fellas ! @entity28 insists you use a fork to tackle a langoustine and advises against sucking ... @entity173 using a small fork upturned in the right hand , scoop out the white fleshy meat from the tail			1
your left hand can be used to secure the shell as you daintily perform your excavation ( a finger bowl should be provided )			1
you may see some people pick up the animal to suckle the head – these people are to be treated with the greatest of social caution			1
@entity186 be sorry : use empty shells as would - be tweezers to help you pluck the flesh from other mussels , says @entity28 ... and always make use of the finger bowl @entity193 the most elegant method is to use a fork to loosen and consume the first mollusc within , before using the empty shell to tweeze out the other mussels , discarding redundant shells on a nearby plate			1
a finger bowl should also be present , to the left of the setting			0
dip one hand in at a time to wash away the grease			0
@entity206 a skilled high - society habitué will know that these are really only eaten in months containing the letter @entity209 the upmarket way to eat is to simply tip the contents into the mouth from the shell , having loosened the contents beforehand with a fork			1
an oyster fork is a @entity218 middle - class invention and does nothing a normal fork can not do			0
if an oyster fork is set , use it			0
if not , just use a normal small fork			0
peas release me : scooping is a no - no , spearing is really the only way to go with the little green spheres @entity229 good hosts will never serve these at a formal dinner party , but if you find yourself confronted by petit pois or the like resist the urge to turn your fork over and scoop			1
instead , use the tines of the fork to spear a collection and transfer to the mouth			0
if mashed potato has been served , or something similar , use that as a ‘ glue ’			0
eaten , never drunk : soup should be pushed away from the diner and then gently tipped into the mouth soup with bread soup is always ‘ eaten ’ , never drunk			1
the soup spoon is held in the right hand and scoops away from you on one side , skimming the surface			1
then sip from the nearside of the spoon			0
tipping the bowl away from you at the end to help you catch the last few mouthfuls is perfectly fine			0
if bread is served with the soup ( let ’s hope not a slice of bread – a bit ‘ try - hard gastropub ’ ) never cut the roll			1
break a bite - sized chunk off , butter if desired , and eat			1
it is not the done thing to divide the bread into two , slather with butter and gnaw away			1
do n’t be caught out as an air - butterer , either – apply the butter to the roll on the plate , not in the air			1
spaghetti spaghetti can be a nightmare for diners and is best avoided in formal social situations ... the one golden rule with pasta is never to cut it , an act of culinary terrorism in @entity286 , no less , according to @entity28 ( right ) this is eaten with a fork alone and never cut with a knife			1
the idea of using a spoon as well comes from the @entity292 but is not practised in authentic @entity286 homes or upmarket @entity295 ones			0
spaghetti can be messy , so avoid ordering this on a date or when dining with clients			0
the good news is , at a formal dinner ( or even a semi-formal soiree ) spaghetti will not be served			0
when in @entity286 , never cut your pasta – doing so is considered an act of culinary terrorism and insult to the cook			0
my thanks to one of @entity319 ’s leading restaurants , @entity314 de @entity313 , for their delicious food which , with the above tips , is very easy to eat			2
etiquette comes first ... but if you get really stuck , then just bluff your way through , says @entity28 dietary requirements it is the guests ’ responsibility upon accepting an invitation to alert their hosts as to their dietary requirements			1
experienced hosts may just wish to check with those who have n’t been invited to their ' casa ' before that the guest does n’t have any life - threatening allergies just to be on the safe side and to stop the impending drama that comes with a guest who suddenly says they are a vegan , rendering your osso bucco ( braised veal ) useless			0
if dining in a restaurant , staff should be well versed in what dishes are suitable for your individual needs			0
funny food occasionally , we get served something that is so tasteless , bland or inedible that persevering is just not an option			0
in which case , your strategy is to eat as much of it as you can muster , push it to one side and devour everything else			2
hosts should not then question you as to whether you liked it or not			0
if they do , reply , smiling , with ‘ i enjoyed what i had , thank you ’			0
what to do when this guide fails you there may very well be an occasion where a food that is not on my guide is set down before you and you are flummoxed as to how best to tackle the tricky food			0
your plan should be to watch what method your host , or the most learned guest , is using to eat the food and copy			2
even if it is not technically correct , they will think it is and so you can bluff your way through the meal … and then get home and research the proper way to eat it so you are n’t caught out again !			1

etiquette expert @entity28 *explains* the proper way to eat
pick up asparagus in your fingers and use a mussel shell to eat mussels
always scoop soup away from you and never ' air butter ' your bread
