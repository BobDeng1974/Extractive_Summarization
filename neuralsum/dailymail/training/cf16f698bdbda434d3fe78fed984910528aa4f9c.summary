@entity0 does n’t know what he ’s let himself in for			1
if the @entity3 owner — who last week bailed out cash - strapped @entity4 with a £ 2million loan — had taken up a seat in the director ’s box at @entity9 on saturday , he would have been greeted by a sea of green			1
with only one grandstand at the @entity14 , spectators are treated to the spectacular , craggy @entity16 landscape — punctuated only by the imposing , red - brick shell of a former whisky distillery which looms over the ground			0
@entity0 did not watch @entity4 at @entity9 but was in attendance as @entity3 beat @entity21 outside , stewards had the unfamiliar task of turning away ticketless fans , while the hospitality area ploughed ahead with a wedding			1
with 1,000 noisy fans on either side , it had the feeling of a plum @entity32 third tie , with the traditional footballing giants taking on the plucky non-league minnows			0
in fact , neither @entity0 , nor @entity37 - based businessman @entity36 or @entity39 owner @entity38 — the prospective saviours of @entity41 — were in attendance as @entity4 laboured to a 3 - 0 victory over their hosts			1
@entity46 ( obscured , second left ) scores @entity4 ' first goal in their 3 - 0 victory over @entity9 if they had been there , the football on show would have been enough to make them change their minds			1
there is no mistake @entity59 ’s side were streets ahead of @entity9 in terms of quality — but only in the way that the @entity63 is superior to the @entity65			2
@entity4 huffed and puffed , hitting over-hit cross after over-hit cross , long punt after long punt			2
only the meagre flashes of brilliance from veteran front - man @entity46 and the marauding runs of left - back @entity73 came close to anything resembling the top - flight			0
‘ they ’re not @entity4 players , ’ one supporter told me as the squads warmed up beforehand			2
‘ they are just filling the gaps until we get back to the @entity86			0
’ @entity3 owner @entity0 's ( left ) loan being accepted has led to @entity89 's resignation part of the problem lies with the management			1
while @entity59 shepherded @entity4 to two easy promotions into the @entity95 , the manager is faltering at the final hurdle with his side seven points behind @entity99 at the summit			1
several fans think it is time for the @entity4 legend to step aside , although shareholder @entity104 confirmed that @entity59 ’s position is safe			1
many also believe that @entity107 maestro @entity0 sees the @entity109 club as a quicker , cheaper route into the @entity111 than his team on @entity113			1
on this showing , it wo n’t be happening any time soon — and a manager with greater pedigree might be required to make those next giant leaps			0
rangers have struggled for consistency this season , leading some fans to question @entity59 's future simply getting out of the @entity95 will be trying			1
after all — with three of @entity126 ’s five best - supported teams vying for promotion , the second tier is incredibly competitive			0
that was clear for all to see on sunday when @entity129 and @entity99 locked horns in the @entity132 derby — a fixture which , until both clubs ’ relegation , graced the @entity86			2
@entity136 was also awash with a sea of green — albeit 10,000 singing and dancing @entity129 fans			0
it was about as far from @entity142 as you can get			0
close your eyes , and it could easily have been the derbies of @entity147 , @entity148 or @entity149 ringing in your ears			0
and while the football was n’t top notch , it was far more lively and enthralling than anything @entity4 served up on saturday			2
@entity4 shareholder and chairman of the football board @entity104 ( left ) has backed the club 's manager @entity129 took the game to their rivals — who are still unbeaten this season — and looked to be holding for a slender 1 - 0 victory going into injury time			1
then came a moment worthy of gracing @entity168 ’s top table			0
@entity171 centre - half @entity169 hit a speculative 35 - yard thunderer which sailed in off the crossbar			0
hearts have preserved their near - perfect start to the campaign because they resolved their financial difficulties in the summer			0
while @entity41 has been playing billionaire bingo during the opening months of the season , the @entity179 club has flourished under fan - ownership and @entity184 ’s side look dead - certs for an immediate return to the big time			0
@entity129 , too , have found their feet following relegation under new manager @entity190 and his outfit will prove tricky opponents for @entity4 if they met in the play - offs			1
today , @entity104 heralded a renewed era of stability under @entity0			2
but they should be warned that restoring @entity4 to greatness wo n’t be a stroll in the @entity16 countryside .			2

@entity0 provided a £ 2million loan to @entity4
but making money out of @entity4 will not be as easy as many predicted
the @entity206 club are currently in the *championship*
rangers are seven points behind league leaders @entity99
some fans have called for manager @entity59 to be sacked
