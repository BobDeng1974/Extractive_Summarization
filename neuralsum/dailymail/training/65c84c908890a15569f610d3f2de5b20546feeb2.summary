by @entity0 published : 23:32 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 11:27 est , 13 march 2014 a 20 - year - old @entity3 mother confessed to police tuesday to killing her ill 17 - month - old son by injecting his feeding tube with @entity8 brand hand sanitizer			1
@entity9 told police she did it to ' end his suffering , ' after the boy was born with @entity14 's syndrome and a serious heart defect			1
the boy 's father @entity16 , 20 , is already behind bars after a similar attempt to kill the baby in october 2012 in which rum was injected into his feeding tube , causing him seizures and brain damage			1
in her interview with police march 11 , @entity9 revealed it was actually she who was behind the first attempt at killing little @entity29 and she 'd used perfume , not rum			1
it was the second time he 'd been poisoned with alcohol			0
the first time , he was just 2 months old and his father @entity16 , right , confessed he did it to ease the infant 's pain			1
he claimed he did n't mean to kill or hurt @entity47			2
one - year - old @entity47 died back on january 24 from acute alcohol intoxication , reports the @entity48			2
that 's when police were called to a home in @entity52 , where they found the child ' breathless and pulseless			2
' he was rushed to a hospital in @entity57 , where he was pronounced dead on arrival			0
an autopsy was performed and found the boy 's blood alcohol level to be 0.280			0
' the legal limit in @entity3 is .08 so that would mean almost four and a half times the legal limit , ' @entity67 's @entity66			0
the autopsy results were revealed earlier this month and police then interviewed @entity9 on tuesday			2
she reportedly told them she 'd injected @entity47 feeding tube with the alcohol - heavy hand sanitizer , but that he did n't die until a day later			1
the story changes : after police determined that @entity47 had been murdered , the interviewed @entity9			2
after confessing to killing her son to ' end his suffering , ' she told police she 'd been the one who tried it in 2012 , not @entity29			1
she also revealed she 'd given the boy perfume in an attempt to kill him , not rum putting on an act ? @entity9 's confession may come as a surprise to anyone who saw a local news segment shot in spring of 2013 when she called out @entity47 's father for harming their child and described the heartache she felt as he suffered seizures in her arms four times the legal limit : @entity47 had a hole in his heart and was in and out of the hospital			1
he also reportedly had three holes in his heart			0
his @entity103 at the time of death was .280 on top of the horrific suffering @entity47 must have endured in the hours before his death , he 'd already suffered seizures and brain damage after rum was dumped into his feeding tube as he lay in the hospital in october 2012 undergoing treatment for his heart defect			1
@entity9 told police on tuesday that she 'd caused that , too			1
@entity47 's father had confessed to the poisoning at the time and said he 'd done it , not to kill him , but to ease his suffering			1
at peace : @entity47 suffered seizures and brain damage after the 2012 attempt on his life			1
he also survived for a day before dying from the hand sanitizer poisoning early this year			2
he died january 24 he remained behind bars just as @entity9 was admitting to police it had been her all along			2
' from what i gathered from the detectives , they basically said she had no remorse , ' said @entity66			0
but the young mother was singing a far different tune while @entity47 was still in her care			2
just last april , @entity9 told @entity134 of the trauma she endured as @entity47 suffered from the rum poisoning and of how it caused a rift between her and the baby 's father			1
' that baby had a seizure in that hospital bed with me and all the nurses and the @entity147 doctors standing around his bed , for 58 minutes			2
i talked to that baby the entire time , trying to get him to come back to me , ' she said last year			0
' right now , i have no relationship with him			0
i do not desire a relationship with him			0
i will never have a relationship with him , ' @entity9 said			0
@entity16 was charged with second - degree cruelty to a juvenile , but it remained unclear just after @entity9 's arrest whether he 'd still stand trial			1
@entity9 , however , will stand trial			0
and at a bond hearing wednesday , she broke down in tears as her charge was read : first degree murder			0
' with the evidence and the age of the child , we believe we have a strong case , ' @entity68 said			0
he also marveled in disbelief at the case			0
' it 's a tragic situation			0
i do n't know what goes through someone 's head , to harm a 17 - month - old			1
i have a 19 - month - old myself , and i could n't put it in my system to do something like that , ' he said			1
no bond was set for @entity9			0
she faces life in prison if convicted .			0
