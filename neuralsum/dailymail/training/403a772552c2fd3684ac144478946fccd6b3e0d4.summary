ever spent ages swapping batteries in and out of remote controls to find out which ones still have power in them ? next time , just try dropping them on a hard surface and see if they bounce			2
this is because spent alkaline batteries are more likely to bounce than fresh ones , according to an @entity12 electrical engineer whose video demonstrating the phenomenon is becoming an internet sensation			1
electrical engineer @entity22 has created a video to test two theories - outgassing and the anti-bounce theory - to explain why this phenomenon occurs when you bounce a dead , or bad , alkaline battery on a solid surface it bounces , while a good battery falls over			1
in a good battery , there is a gel - like substance , while in a bad battery this substance is solid			1
mr @entity22 believes the gel in a good battery works in a similar way to the buckshot in the anti-bounce hammer			1
a regular hammer will bounce when hit against a surface , but an anti-bounce hammer is fitted with a cylinder full of buckshot			2
as the hammer hits the surface , the buckshot lags behind the movement , and when the hammer hits the base , the buckshot catches up with it and as the hammer starts to bounce , the buckshot forces it down again			0
as the battery hits the surface , the gel catches up and creates a downward force to counteract the upward trajectory in a similar way			1
in his @entity62 video , @entity22 tests a series of batteries that have expired against a set which have not been used			2
he demonstrates that a used battery bounces far higher than one that has only just been taken out of the packet			1
a good battery , he explains , contains a gel - like substance which solidifies as the battery discharges its electricity			1
while the gel is in a semi-liquid form , it absorbs the energy when the battery hits the surface			2
an anti-bounce hammer , which contains an internal core of moving buckshot , works in the same @entity82 the gel in the battery has solidified it can not move and the whole battery bounces , the same way that a solid hammer bounces off a nail			1
the theory was greeted with caution by academics in @entity91 last night , as chemistry and physics departments across the country tried to test the idea for themselves			2
many said the theory made sense – but few were able to replicate mr @entity22 ’s results			1
a spokesman for the @entity102 said there was ‘ sound thinking behind the idea ’ but added : ‘ experiments need to be reproducible for results to be reliable			0
we ’re struggling to replicate the experiment over here			0
’ dr @entity110 , a senior lecturer in chemistry at the @entity112 , said the video had convinced him			0
‘ if the gel in the battery is in a liquid state it absorbs that kinetic energy – all the energy is gone and the battery does not bounce back , ’ he said			2
‘ but if it turns into a solid state the kinetic energy pushes it back away from the surface and it bounces			0
' to test outgassing , mr @entity22 dropped a weight on the battery			1
if there was a build up of pressure , a weight should bounce higher on one than the other			0
he also drilled holes in the batteries to release this pressure			0
there was not a ' convincing ' difference in the first test , and the bad battery still bounced in the second in terms of the anti-bounce theory , mr @entity22 used hammers to demonstrate			1
a regular hammer will bounce when hit against a surface , but an anti-bounce hammer ( pictured ) is fitted with buckshot			0
as the hammer hits the surface , the buckshot lags behind , and when the hammer hits the base , the buckshot catches up with it mr @entity22 then cut the batteries open to see how the electrolyte in a good and bad battery differs			1
in a good battery , it has a gel - like substance ( left ) , while in a bad battery it is solid ( right )			1
mr @entity22 believes the gel in a good battery works in a similar way to the buckshot in the anti-bounce hammer and causes a downward force dr @entity166 , a chemist at the @entity167 , said : ‘ this video has prompted me and my colleagues to dig out dud batteries from all over the place to try it out for ourselves			1
’ he added : ‘ the energy output of a battery arises from chemical changes , which means the material in the battery at the start will be chemically different from that when discharged			0
‘ it may be that these changes would influence how it behaves when dropped on to a desk			0
but i remain to be convinced			0
’ a spokesman for battery maker @entity184 said : ‘ this bounce test is certainly not an accurate way to measure battery life			2
’ he added : ‘ while the density of the materials does change as the battery is discharged , it is not indicative to power delivery			0
‘ as batteries are discharged , the internal volume increases due to the expansion of materials			0
this often makes the battery swell and can play an important role in how it will balance when dropped			0

electrical engineer @entity22 put the bouncing battery theories to the test
he wanted to know why a dead alkaline battery bounces
mr @entity22 began by bouncing good and bad batteries through a tube
he then opened them to discover how they differed inside
good batteries do *n’t* bounce because of the anti-bounce theory , said mr @entity22
this theory states the gel - like substance in a good battery creates a downward force and stops it from bouncing
