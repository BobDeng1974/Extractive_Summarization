' en masse : the community of @entity31 was so shaken by the cheerleader 's august 2010 death that more than 2,000 people attended a vigil to remember the teen known as ' @entity55 ' disbelief : friends and classmates of ms @entity19 exchanged hugs and cried during the vigil a town in shock : mourners held candles at the august 29 , 2010 vigil for @entity19 in in @entity31 @entity28 was 36 when he began pursuing the teen after meeting her at a party in july that year			1
' she is a teenager , ' prosecutor @entity67 told jurors earlier on friday			0
' maybe this little girl is trying to be a little bit older than she was - but he was a lot older			0
' mr @entity67 reminded jurors of the hundreds of text messages @entity28 exchanged with @entity19 , underlining his obsession with the teen , including the text messages that showed he picked her up the night she disappeared and that she thought she was going to a party			1
the prosecutor noted @entity28 's semen was found mixed with @entity19 's dna in his vehicle			1
