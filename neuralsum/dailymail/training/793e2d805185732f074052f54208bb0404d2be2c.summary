by @entity0 it â€™s official : money can indeed buy happiness - but you do n't need to be anywhere near a millionaire to be content in life , finds a new study			1
@entity10 's recent @entity9 found that just over half of its 1,000 people surveyed said that an annual income of under $ 100,000 would be enough to make them ' happy			1
' ten per cent of those questioned said they would be happy earning under $ 30,000 , and only six percent staunchly stated that ' money ca n't buy happiness			0
' happy days : a new survey has found that 51per cent of those polled said an annual income of under $ 100,000 would be enough to make them happy , while a quarter would settle for $ 50 - 75,000 apparently then , most of us agree that the amount cash we have to throw around does make a difference to our happiness in life			1
nearly a quarter of those polled were happy to settle with between $ 50,000 - which is the average @entity34 's household income , according to the latest census data - and $ 75,000 a year			1
and this quarter may be on to something			0
a separate study on close to half a million people , conducted by @entity40 in 2010 , found that our ' happiness ' does rise in line with how much money we are making , but only up to an annual income of about $ 75,000			1
after that , higher incomes certainly buy ' life satisfaction ' - leading people to view their lives as a whole in high regard - but it does n't buy happiness , which was quantified more on people 's day - to - day emotional well - being			0
that study did concede that the inevitable trials and tribulations of being less fortunate does cause people to feel both unsatisfied by their lives , and unhappy emotionally			0
according to @entity34 census data , ' poor ' is defined as a four - person family living on under $ 23,000 annually , which includes around $ 46.2 million @entity34			2
and what do the respondents of @entity64 's @entity9 poll quantify as being wealthy ? sixty per cent would call themselves ' rich ' earning under $ 250,000 annually , and the most typical answers fell between $ 100,000 and $ 200,000			2
eleven percent said they 'd need over $ 1 million to truly call themselves rich			0
in summary then , perhaps @entity71 had it right when he once said : ' money is better than poverty , if only for financial reasons			0

@entity10 's poll found most of us are indeed willing to put a number on happiness
the average @entity34 household income is $ 50,000
a separate study found that happiness does *increase* with income , but only up to $ 75,000
