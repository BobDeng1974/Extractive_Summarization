by @entity0 at just eight months old @entity1 is already stealing the limelight away from his parents as he gets his first taste of the spot light as they embark on their tour of @entity7 and @entity8			1
however while the presence of the future king is clearly delighting the crowds , and no doubt giving great joy to his doting parents , such a long and arduous schedule is likely to take its toll on the youngster			0
his parents possible worry about how their son will handle the tour will be exacerbated by the fact that he is teething - with several gnashers clearly visible as he smiled and gurgled at @entity22 on the first day of their official tour to @entity8			1
the arrangement means his doting parents will be able to travel back to see @entity1 almost every night – bar a stop - over in @entity52 , @entity7 , and another at @entity53 in @entity8			1
the 18 - day visit , which begins in @entity22 , @entity7 , is the @entity57 family ’s first official overseas trip together and @entity33 and @entity41 ’s first major journey with eight - month - old @entity1			1
while @entity1 seemed in good spirits as the family brought their long flight to an end , experts warn that teething can cause a range of distressing symptoms and increased irritability sources have told the @entity68 that the little prince is also starting to crawl which will only add to the unpredictability of official events on the tour royal aides have warned that @entity1 ’s scheduled public appearances are open to change given his young age and the fact that no - one knows how he will cope with the long journey and 11 - hour time difference , especially since he is teething			1
sources have told the @entity68 that the little prince is indeed teething - as well as starting to crawl - which will only add to the unpredictability of official events on the tour			2
as well as enduring a 22 - hour - flight to reach their destination , moving between their three hubs and travelling to engagements will result in @entity33 and @entity41 being forced to travel extensively with the teething prince over the next three weeks			1
however as mother of one , @entity95 , 31 , tells @entity96 , the two are not happy bed companions : ‘ having recently endured an overnight flight to @entity93 with my teething 10 - month - old , i have every sympathy for what @entity33 must have gone through on her journey to @entity7			1
' seeing my baby in pain is distressing at any time , but teething is especially hard to deal with – not least because at first it ’s often impossible to know what ’s wrong			0
' my baby had a temperature , a runny tummy and an awful rash when we were on board and a dose of @entity114 did n’t restore her to her usual cheery self – or help her sleep ! i was desperately worried she was ill until i realised that she seemed to be soothed by biting hard on her teether			0
of course the unfamiliar surroundings of the aeroplane and the changing air - pressure made her even more uncomfortable – as did the constant stream of dribble soaking her pyjamas			0
' one thing the @entity125 should be glad of is that she did n’t also have to deal with the tuts from other unhappy passengers ! ’ dentist dr @entity128 , from @entity129 says : ' i am sure @entity41 and @entity33 will be having a few sleepless nights already down to teething , as many parents do			1
' babies teeth vary at what age teeth come through but around 6 months is the average age			2
a range of symptoms can affect a baby from red and slightly inflamed gums , flushed face and cheek to dribbling			1
there is an urge to chew and gnaw things so a chilled teething ring is a good option			0
cool things seem to soothe			0
teething gels may offer some instant comfort and lots of cuddles for additional comfort ( parents often need that too from the sleepless nights ! ) some babies get red / flushed cheeks and can be quite irritable and it 's important to make sure they do n't get rashes from the constant dribbling so they chin needs to be wiped and kept dry			1
' some parents have said it can cause diarrhoea but if this does occur with a temperature it should n't be left for more than 24 hours			0
length of time with symptoms can vary but for the majority of children it tends to be whilst their first 2 teeth are coming through			2
avoid anything with sugar though e.g. teething rusks instead chilled vegetables , carrots work well			0
' eager members of the public are expected to be given no less than six glimpses of the tiny future king on his first royal tour , including a photo call at @entity184 in @entity22 and a visit to the world famous @entity186 in @entity45			2
perhaps revealing the couple are feeling the effects of the hard work involved in raising a teething infant prince @entity41 said recently that ' one is enough at the moment ' when it comes to babies			1
the royal father made the telling comment when the couple visited the @entity199 barracks for @entity200 in march , and judging by the numerous teeth glimpsed in the young prince ’s mouth , it is unlikely that their experience of parenting will have eased in the past month			1
being trapped in a confined space with a grizzly , inconsolable , teething baby for 30 hours is most parents ' idea of hell			2
even if the baby is prince and you are in a luxurious first class cabin , surrounded by nannies and assistants , there 'd be no getting away from those piercing cries , the angry red cheeks and the fury and frustration of a 10 - month - old who is in a whole world of pain and does n't understand why			0
but that 's only the half of it			0
very often , teething babies also suffer from sore ears ( not helped by changes in cabin pressure ) diarrhoea , fever and vomiting as a side effect			2
my daughter @entity237 , now thankfully four and in possession of a full set of gnashers , would projectile vomit when i fed her and do horrendously acidic poohs which burnt her bottom and gave her nappy rash unless changed instantly , when she had teeth coming through			0
@entity247 , now 22 - months , was also quite sick and dribbled so excessively that i would have to change his t - shirts four or five times a day as he 'd be soaking wet			0
i wish @entity33 all the luck in the world for the next few weeks and the lengthy flight home – in my experience , she 's going to need it ! @entity255 is the author of @entity256 : simple ways to boost your child 's speech and language development from birth .			0

several teeth were visible inside @entity1 's mouth as royal family arrived in @entity7
at eight months old @entity41 is in the *middle* of the *typical* teething phase
experts say as well as increased irritability , can cause range of symptoms
fever , flushed face , rashes and dribbling can all result from teething
will be additional *challenge* during three week tour for the young parents
