@entity2 @entity1 , 52 , lied to police about her friendship with @entity12 , who was described as ' a man of interest ' by detectives investigating the £ 52million robbery of a @entity18 warehouse in @entity19 , @entity20 , in 2006			1
@entity1 denied five charges of misconduct in a public office between 2004 and 2012 but was convicted today by a jury at @entity25 and jailed for two and a half years			1
@entity26 met mr may when she sold her £ 760,000 house to him and the two became ‘ at least ’ friends			0
the court heard at one stage she was even asked by senior police officers if she knew ' trustworthy ' neighbours in the street who could help them with surveillance on mr may ’s house			2
@entity12 was never arrested or charged in connection with the robbery , and is not a police suspect in the case			1
@entity1 was working in the community safety unit at @entity47 police station in @entity48			1
last year mr may attended the police station to report someone was trying to kill him , giving a description of the car , an @entity52 , and its registration number			0
the following day @entity1 told a colleague she had seen a black @entity52 and its occupants ' behaving suspiciously ' on her way to work that morning			2
she said she had kept a note of the car ’s registration number which matched the one given by mr may the previous day			0
@entity1 obtained a print - out of the @entity52 ’s details on the @entity63 ( police national computer ) , including its history and registered owner			1

senior officers had already been suspicious of her conduct and on her way home from work she was stopped by police and arrested			0
@entity1 , from @entity78 , @entity20 , was found to wrongly have the @entity63 print - out in her possession , and she had handwritten the same details on another piece of paper			1

@entity1 worked in the community safety unit at @entity47 police station in @entity48 judge @entity88 told @entity1 , pictured arriving at court , that offences by officers ' seriously undermine the trust in the police service ' investigating officers looking into the pc ’s association with mr may found this was not the first time she had been spoken to about using the @entity63 for non-policing purposes			1
between 2004 and 2005 @entity1 had used the @entity100 police system to check the profile of mr may			1
in june 2005 she accessed information on a @entity103 listed on the database , a former partner of mr may			2
and in 2006 @entity1 checked the profile of @entity106			2
he too was ' associated ' with mr may			0
@entity1 was given a formal warning by the @entity109 of @entity110 in 2008 to ' show a higher degree of honesty and integrity ' when using the police system			1
but she still failed to disclose her association with mr may when submitting a vetting form to fellow officers in november 2011			0
prosecutor @entity118 told the court : ' we know that @entity121 was aware of may ’s status as a man of interest to police			0
' she knew he had been linked to one of the biggest robberies , not just in @entity20 but in the @entity10			0
' investigating officers working on the @entity18 robbery considered @entity130 , so much so that they wanted to set up an observation operation on his home			1
' officers discovered that @entity121 had connections to this address , namely she used to live in the house before may			0
' an officer leading the @entity18 case emailed @entity1 asking if she knew any trustworthy people in the street who they could contact in a bid to set up their surveillance operation			1
' @entity1 replied saying that she did not , however she did assist in compiling a full layout of the house			2
' jailing her for two and a half years , judge @entity88 told @entity121 : ' you told lies to other officers , including superiors , perhaps to cover your tracks for your dishonest and criminal behaviour			1
' this was an extended course of misconduct carried out over many years			2
the misuse of the computer relates to major criminals and not mundane matters			0
' it is clear that misconduct by police officers such as committed by you seriously undermine the trust in the polices service which the public are entitled to			1
' @entity1 joined @entity110 in june 2002 about a year after separating from her husband			2
the court heard she was ' at least ' friends with may - having regular and general contact , although she referred to him as a ' neighbour '			0
@entity20 assistant chief constable @entity172 said : ' the vast majority of officers serve with the utmost integrity , honour and pride			0
' it is important that those rare few who cross the line are dealt with appropriately and charged if an offence has been committed			0
