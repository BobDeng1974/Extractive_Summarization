by @entity0 published : 16:01 est , 8 september 2012 updated : 07:22 est , 10 september 2012 denial : @entity3 says he is definitely not going to return to @entity4 @entity3 is being lined up to return to a safe @entity5 in 2015 and mount an immediate leadership challenge if @entity7 fails to secure an overall majority			1
allies of the @entity11 mayor , whose popularity has been boosted by the success of the @entity14 and @entity15 , played down the prospect of him making a @entity19 comeback before that			0
their comments came despite swirling rumours of plots against the prime minister and to install mr @entity3			2
one conservative mp , colonel @entity25 , said two colleagues approached him before the summer break to consider a ‘ stalking horse ’ challenge for the party leadership that might open the door for mr @entity3 to take over			1
but colonel @entity25 told them to ‘ get lost ’			0
the mayor infuriated @entity35 by going to war with mr @entity7 last week , criticising what he called a ‘ fudgearama ’ over increasing airport capacity			2
but a spokesman for mr @entity3 dismissed as ‘ fanciful ’ a claim that multi- millionaire @entity42 rebel @entity41 , who has threatened to quit @entity4 if the government goes ahead with a third runway at @entity46 , offered his south - west @entity11 seat to the mayor			1
however , despite the denials from @entity52 , the rumours about mr @entity3 's return to @entity19 do not seem to be going away			0
mr @entity3 did meet mr @entity41 and the by - election scheme is thought to have been ‘ jokingly ’ mentioned , but the mayor is said to have dismissed it out of hand			1
mr @entity41 wrote yesterday on @entity78 : ‘ i have never offered to resign ! but i did promise before the election that i would , if the @entity81 on @entity46			0
’ but mps who want to see mr @entity3 in @entity83 confirmed privately that advanced discussions had taken place on finding him a seat for the 2015 election			1
mr @entity41 ’s seat is not considered safe enough because it is a marginal			1
two that have been discussed by mr @entity3 ’s supporters are @entity91 , where veteran mp sir @entity92 might be persuaded to step down , and @entity93 , the mayor ’s old commons seat			2
mr @entity3 has always insisted he has no intention of trying to oust mr @entity7 and has pledged to see out his second term as mayor			1
but while he would be heavily criticised if he tried to combine the role of mayor and mp for an extended period , he is due to leave office in @entity11 in 2016			0
that would mean the two jobs would only overlap for a year if he made a comeback at the next general election			0
one rebel @entity92 said : ‘ the aim is that @entity3 is in place at the next election			2
if @entity7 loses the election badly , he ’ll resign and @entity3 will stand , but if he misses a majority again and tries to stitch up another coalition with the @entity115 then there will be blood on the walls			1
we wo n’t let him do it again			0
’ another rebel @entity42 , @entity120 , said : ‘ we need to get @entity3 in and @entity7 out to survive 2015			1
’ but mr @entity3 said he was ‘ absolutely not ’ planning a return to the @entity122			0
‘ as i said in the election about a billion times , being mayor is the best job in @entity128 politics and it ’s what i want to do , ’ he said			0
