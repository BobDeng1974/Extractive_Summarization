a giant salt water crocodile that lived 160 million years ago was as long as of a double - decker bus , scientists claim			1
the terrifying creature roamed the ocean feasting on marine animals such as turtles and may even have eaten dinosaurs , according to a new study			0
the fearsome prehistoric reptile measured more than 30 feet long ( 9 metres )			1
a giant salt water crocodile that lived 160 million years ago was almost as long as a double - decker bus , scientists claim			2
@entity13 ( illustrated ) was the largest at 30.4ft ( 9.3 metres ) fresh research into @entity15 reveals key details of how and where it lived			1
experts say three different species could be found in @entity21 and a fourth in @entity22			2
@entity13 was the largest at 30.4ft ( 9.3 metres ) which is larger than the biggest @entity25 or saltwater crocodiles of the modern era			1
the biggest living captive crocodile living today measures 18ft ( 5.5 m )			0
the smallest of the prehistoric crocodiles was @entity31 at around 19 feet ( 6 metres ) , while @entity33 mosae was between 20 and 26 feet ( 6 to 8 metres )			1
the @entity35 creature , @entity34 , is only known from a single tooth , so its body length can not be reliably estimated			0
four species of @entity15 roamed the ocean feasting on marine animals such as turtles and even dinosaurs			1
three of the species believed to live in the area which is now modern @entity21 , are illustrated , along with a human to show scale @entity13 was the largest of of the prehistoric crocodiles at 30.4ft ( 9.3 metres ) which is bigger than the largest @entity25 or saltwater crocodiles of the modern era			1
the biggest living captive crocodile living today measures 18ft ( 5.5 m ) a stock image of a saltwater crocodile in @entity57 , @entity58 , is pictured four species of @entity15 lived 160 million years ago			1
three could be found in the waters around @entity21 and one in @entity35			0
the creatures ate marine animals such as turtles and even perhaps dinosaurs			1
although @entity15 had blunt , conical teeth and long , slender snouts , they were so large that they could almost anything they wanted			1

the @entity35 creature , @entity34 , is only known from a single tooth , so its body length can not be reliably estimated			0
each of the species evolved to hunt in different habitats , from open seas to rivers			0
‘ @entity81 was the largest of all these species , with a body length exceeding nine metres , dr @entity84 , of the @entity85 , said			1
although @entity15 had blunt , concical teeth and long , slender snouts , they were so large that they could almost anything they wanted			1
bite marks inflicted by one of the beasts have even been found in the fossilised bones of a giant long - necked dinosaur			1
scientists believe @entity15 swam long distances in the open sea , but probably hunted near coasts , snatching any unfortunate animal that got too close			2
each of the species adapted features that enabled them to live and hunt in a range of habitats			0
they varied in body length , the composition of their skeleton , skull and lower jaw shape			0
@entity15 fed on marine turtles and lived during the @entity110 , either on the coast or in large rivers flowing into the sea			2
@entity13 would have been well adapted for swimming in open seas while its closest cousins lived stuck close to the coast			2
although @entity15 had blunt , concical teeth and long , slender snouts , it was so large it could almost anything it wanted			1
bite marks inflicted by the beast have even been found in the fossilised bones of a giant long - necked dinosaur			1
this illustration shows a @entity129 , which lived at around the same time the study , published in @entity131 , analysed fossils held in museums across @entity21 and found they were much bigger than any living crocodile			2
the evolution of @entity15 mirrors that of today ’s crocodiles , whose saltwater varieties are far bigger and suited to larger territories compared with their smaller cousins that live closer to shore or in fresh water			1
from detailed analysis , the researchers were able to determine key elements of the animals ’ anatomy and lifestyle and concluded not all were of the same species			0
until now , scientists were unsure whether more than one species of @entity15 existed			2
in may 2012 , paleontologists from @entity156 shared news of the fossilised remains of a 60 - million - year - old @entity160 giant turtle ( illustrated ) that lived in what is now @entity162 in may 2012 , paleontologists from @entity156 shared news of the fossilised remains of a 60 - million - year - old @entity160 giant that lived in what is now @entity162			2
@entity166 , which means ' coal turtle ' , was part of a group of turtles known as pelomedusoides			0
the specimen 's skull measures xx inches ( 24cm ) and the shell , which was recovered nearby and is believed to belong to the same animal - measures five feet seven inches long ( 172cm )			0
the fossil was named @entity166 because it was discovered in 2005 in a coal mine that was part of northern @entity162 's @entity179 formation			0
dr @entity180 , a palaeontologist and research associate at the @entity182 , believes a turtle of this size would have needed a large territory in order to obtain enough food to survive			0
' it 's like having one big snapping turtle living in the middle of a lake , ' he said			0
' that turtle survives because it has eaten all of the major competitors for resources			0
we found many bite - marked shells at this site that show crocodilians preyed on side - necked turtles			1
' none would have bothered an adult @entity166 , though - in fact smaller crocs would have been easy prey for this behemoth			0
' smaller relatives of @entity166 existed alongside dinosaurs			0
but the giant version appeared five million years after the dinosaurs vanished , during a period when giant varieties of many different reptiles – including @entity213 , the largest snake ever discovered – lived in this part of @entity160 .			0

fearsome prehistoric *predator* measured more than 30 feet long ( 9 metres )
three different species of @entity15 lived in @entity21
@entity13 was the largest , while @entity31 was the smallest at around 19 feet ( 6 metres ) , according to @entity85 paleontologists
creatures had blunt , conical teeth and long , slender snouts
@entity227 evidence shows they ate turtles and even long - necked dinosaurs
