by @entity0 once considered a pioneering technology , plasma tvs have been delivered another nail in the coffin			1
@entity5 has become the latest manufacturer to announce it will be shutting down its plasma panel business , effective from 30 november			1
according to reports , the @entity9 firm blamed the decline in ‘ overall demand for plasma televisions ’ for its decision			1
@entity5 announced it will shut down its plasma panel business on 30 november , blaming the decline in ' overall demand for plasma televisions '			1
the 51 - inch @entity19 ( pictured ) will be one of the last @entity5 models to feature the technology @entity5 told @entity23 : ' we plan to continue our @entity26 tv business until the end of this year , due to changes in market demands			1
' we remain committed to providing consumers with products that meet their needs , and will increase our focus on growth opportunities in @entity35 ’s and @entity36 ’s			0

plasma displays use tiny gas cells placed between two panes of glass			2
each cell acts like a mini fluorescent tube , emitting ultraviolet light which then strikes red , green and blue glowing spots on the screen			0
by comparison , liquid crystal display ( lcd ) tvs use light from behind the screen that is shone through coloured liquid crystal cells			2
signals control each cell , letting varying amounts of colour through to build up the picture			0
led televisions work in a similar way to lcd technology , but tiny leds , rather than backlight lamps , illuminate the cells			2
@entity69 ( organic light - emitting diode ) screens are similar to led , but are more equipped to handling @entity71 , or ultra-high - definition			0
this leaves @entity74 as the last major manufacturer of plasma displays			2
according to @entity80 , @entity5 ’s vice president of @entity79 r&d office , @entity77 , hinted that the end was nigh for plasma last year			1
@entity77 said he did n't think plasma had a future beyond 2014 , because it was difficult to make an affordable @entity71 version of the technology			0

traditionally , plasma tvs were bulky , while @entity110 and @entity70 were much thinner , and the latter overtook sales of the former from 2006			1
@entity26 also ca n’t compete with the likes of @entity69 ( organic light - emitting diode ) screens , especially those that can handle @entity71 , or ultra-high - definition , pictures that have four times the pixels of @entity138 .			0
