by @entity0 published : 01:51 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 08:22 est , 10 january 2014 regulating the bedroom : ultra-conservative @entity4 senator @entity3 of @entity5 is currently proposing a bill that would outlaw oral sex between teens a new bill being considered by @entity10 would make oral sex between teenagers illegal			1
the bill is being proposed by ultra-conservative @entity3 senator @entity3 , in an attempt to get a previously proposed ' crimes against nature ' law passed			1
this law , which made it a felony to carnally know ' any male or female person by the anus or by or with the mouth ' was shut down by the @entity24 for the @entity25 because it violates the 14th amendment , which guarantees the rights of due process and equal protection			1
senator @entity3 hoped to get around the 14th amendment this second time around by restricting the law to just minors			2
in the new bill summary , senator @entity3 clarifies that these ' crimes against nature ' are not illegal if commited between adults , are not in a public place and do n't involve prostitution			1
the phrasing of the new bill suggests that oral sex with and between minors would be a felony			0
in an email to the @entity45 , senator @entity3 defended his bill by saying its aim was not to prohibit oral sex between teens , but to protect them from child predators			1
he said he was concerned that predators convitcted of ' crimes against nature ' with children or teens ' may pursue appeal and quite possibly be released			0
' if that 's the case , legal experts say senator @entity3 should have drafted a law against predators instead of against certain sexual acts			2
' if he wants to prosecute people who abuse children , why not write a law that would ban abuse of children , ' @entity64 law professor @entity63 told @entity45			0
working on it : senator @entity3 says this is n't the final version of the bill that he will propose to the legislature			2
above , the @entity75 the proposed bill is also causing controversy in the @entity79 community by people who say it 's discriminatory towards people who have non-genital sex			0
@entity84 ± aga , the executive director of the @entity85 of @entity5 told @entity86 that her group would oppose the bill because ' it leaves in place discriminatory treatment and does n't address the underlying problem that @entity79 people are treated differently than folks that have other kinds of sex			0
' but senator @entity3 promises that this is n't the final version of @entity98			1
' our office has been inundated with extremely unsavory telephone calls and emails , ' senator @entity3 said in the email			0
' for the record , i have heard the concerns and have started to draft an amendment to my bill that will deal with the unintended consequences of a bill that is nothing but well - intentioned			0

@entity98 14 *defines* ' crimes against nature ' as knowing ' any male or female person by the anus or by or with the mouth '
consenting adults who perform these sex acts in *private* and are n't practicing prostitution are *excepted* from the felony
the wording therefore makes it illegal for two consenting teens to have oral sex
senator @entity3 is *sponsoring* the bill and says he is drafting an amendment to address complaints about the bill 's ' unintended consequences '
