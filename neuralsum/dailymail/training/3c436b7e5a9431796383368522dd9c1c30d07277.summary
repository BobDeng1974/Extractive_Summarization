@entity0 will be restored to his natural habitat on saturday as @entity2 seek a solution to their perennial midfield conundrum by reverting to the partnership which excelled in @entity7			1
a week after the experimental deployment of the @entity10 centre out wide , he will be back in the no 13 shirt for the series finale in @entity13 , alongside @entity14			1
the decision by @entity16 and his assistants to reunite that @entity19 axis means an abrupt demotion for @entity21 and @entity22 – the former right out of the match - day 23 and the latter to the replacements bench			1
@entity26 : @entity0 will return to his favoured position when @entity2 meet @entity28 in @entity13 demoted : @entity22 ( @entity29 ) and @entity21 have been sacrificed to make changes @entity31 rouses @entity2 pack for final push the upheaval does n’t end there , in the aftermath of the 28 - 27 second @entity38 defeat in @entity39 , as there are seven personnel changes to the starting xv , despite @entity43 ’s intention to minimise disruption and foster continuity			1
the anticipated half - back revamp is in response to injuries , with @entity49 and @entity50 replacing @entity51 and @entity52 , who have shoulder and knee problems respectively			1
@entity55 has been recalled to fill the wing space vacated by @entity0			1
up front , the coaches have opted to add ballast from among the @entity61 contingent who arrived late on tour – with @entity64 returning at hooker , @entity66 in the second row and @entity68 at @entity69			1
the powerful trio are expected to provide physicality and the intensity of men who have impatiently awaited this belated opportunity			0
amid talking points aplenty , the midfield equation is once again prominent			0
it is the area which has caused @entity2 endless problems and prompted regular debates for a decade and more , since the @entity80 - winning days of @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			1
like his predecessors , @entity16 has been forced to constantly reshuffle his centre candidates , partly due to injury and partly due to the never - ending quest to find the most potent blend			1
diving in : @entity55 will take over @entity0 's place on the wing against @entity28 the head coach denied yesterday that this latest 12 - 13 selection represented excessive rotation , while confirming that it was a form call			1
‘ i do n’t think it ’ s muddied the waters , ’ said @entity16			1
‘ we actually played the same backline throughout the whole @entity99 , give or take			0
the @entity102 - @entity101 partnership played right the way through			0
‘ i still think we are finding out which players can really deliver at the highest level			0
we ’ve had a good chance to look at @entity21 during the course of the season			2
@entity14 ’s come in , he ’s had one opportunity , he ’s taken it , so now ’s the right time to give him a second chance			0
‘ @entity21 was n’t that far off it at the weekend , but when i look at the two games , i thought @entity14 edged him			2
when you are weighing that up , and you want to have a look at @entity14 at some point , the reality is that we need four centres who can play throughout the @entity80 , so we need to find out now			0
’ it is ironic that the 10 - 12 combination of @entity50 and @entity124 was viewed as a potential weak link going into the series opener and now those same players will be tasked with inspiring a consolation victory			2
in a spin : @entity2 coach @entity130 denies that his seven personnel changes are excessive @entity132 says @entity134 win will help @entity38 team @entity16 has repeatedly emphasised that he prefers a genuine second - receiver playmaker at inside centre and he believes @entity138 can fulfil that brief , as @entity21 has done in the past			1
‘ i think they are very similar in terms of what they offer , ’ he said			0
‘ we want @entity14 to support @entity50 the way he did in the first test , offer that ball - playing ability and keep width in our game			2
he has a good , improved kicking game and he ’s on form			0
’ @entity16 denied that the recall and swift removal of both @entity21 and @entity22 from the starting midfield suggested that the coaches were indulging in impulsive tinkering			1
he insisted that it was a valid leap of faith in players who had distinguished themselves during the @entity99			0
‘ @entity21 picked up his injury on may 3 and really only trained in the week prior to the second test , ’ he said			2
‘ looking back , it was a big step to put him into that second test			0
i do n’t regret it because i do n’t think it was the key differential between winning and losing , but it was a big step and how are you supposed to know unless you try it ? for @entity22 , too , it was a big step to play at that level			2
’ ballast : @entity68 will provide physicality and intensity as part of @entity2 's front three the one - match experiment of using @entity0 on the wing was not the resounding success the coaches would have hoped for , but @entity16 was adamant that he had no regrets on that score either , adding : ‘ i think it was fine			1
@entity0 played well and did n’t make any errors			2
he contributed well to the game and it is definitely something we will look at for the future			0
it is more about us feeling that the centre partnership worked better in the first test than in the second			0
’ @entity55 ’s return to the starting line - up is a positive end to a difficult period for the cross-code wing			1
his try - scoring cameo as a replacement last weekend was his first appearance for @entity2 in 2014 , having been dropped prior the @entity99 , but management doubts about @entity199 ’s reliability at this level have created an opening for him to re-establish himself			1
‘ it ’s a massive opportunity for him , ’ said @entity16			2
we felt he had areas of his game to work on and all the evidence is that he is ready to take his chance again			0
we will see whether he has learned and can deliver again			0
’ @entity2 : @entity210 ( @entity211 ) ; @entity212 ( @entity213 ) , @entity214 ( @entity10 ) , @entity138 ( @entity215 ) , @entity216 ( @entity211 ) ; @entity217 ( @entity10 ) , @entity218 ( @entity10 ) ; @entity219 ( @entity211 ) , @entity220 ( @entity221 ) , @entity222 ( @entity215 ) ; @entity223 ( @entity221 ) , @entity224 ( @entity10 ) ; @entity225 ( @entity221 ) , @entity226 ( @entity213 ) , @entity227 ( @entity211			0
