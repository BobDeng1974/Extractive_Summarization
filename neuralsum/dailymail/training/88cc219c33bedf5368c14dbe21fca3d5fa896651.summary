by @entity0 - parkinson published : 05:57 est , 27 june 2012 updated : 09:40 est , 27 june 2012 defence secretary @entity1 will go to the opening of the @entity3 despite his department 's refusal to pay for the ceremony @entity1 has been branded a hypocrite for his decision to attend the unveiling of a new memorial to @entity11 despite refusing to pay for the event			1
the defence secretary will go to the opening ceremony even though the @entity14 said it would not stump up £ 700,000 for the event			1
instead , war veterans are footing the bill to unveil it and will be personally liable for the cost of staging the event if they fail to raise the money through donations			1
the opening of the memorial is a long - awaited event and there is a waiting list for veterans who want to be there on the special day			1
mr @entity1 's attendance at the event means that one seat will be denied to them			0
the @entity34 has spent five years raising £ 6.5million to build the new memorial			1
they still have to find £ 700,000 to provide seating and security for the event on thursday , which will be attended by ten members of the @entity42 including the @entity43			2
fundraising director of the memorial , @entity44 , told the @entity46 : ' anyone with a measure of empathy will understand how the very elderly are anxious when faced with financial worries			0
' we are the organisers of what has become all but a state occasion in the glare of international publicity			0
' he added : ' i find it hypocritical that a secretary of state for defence can turn up on thursday representing the prime minister knowing a veteran trustee has his house on the line to pay for his seat			0
' the monument , in @entity67 's @entity66 , will commemorate the @entity70 airmen who died in the @entity71			1
it has already proved controversial after it emerged that more than 100 veterans could miss out on the unveiling because of a lack of space			2
extraordinary : workmen put the finishing touches to the @entity3 on @entity80 , which will be unveiled tomorrow tribute : at the heart of the memorial will be the statues of a seven - man bomber crew cast in bronze earlier this month , @entity88 gave the trustees hope when he told @entity91 the government had ' the ability to intervene ' if funds were not raised in time			1
but now the trustees , who include four @entity11 veterans , have been told the @entity97 will not help			2
mr @entity1 said : ' the @entity97 recognises the unique contribution and sacrifice that the men of @entity11 made to protect @entity101			0
' only as recently as last week , mr @entity44 said the veterans were still £ 500,000 short			1
' the @entity97 response to this has been disgusting , ' he said			0
' the unveiling has become a state occasion , yet we are getting no help from the state			0
' trustee and veteran @entity110 , 88 , from @entity112 , @entity113 , said : ' if we ca n't get the £ 500,000 i will probably lose my house			2
i have n't got much else			0
' sculptor @entity116 puts the finishing touches to the statue ' @entity119 ' before a mould is made of it a mould was taken of the figures before they were cast in bronze and put on @entity127 stone plinths at @entity66 the memorial was built with private donations , but the bill for its unveiling has risen because the 6,500 widows and veterans face security checks before they can enter @entity66			1
sculptor @entity116 created the 9ft statues that will form the centrepiece of the memorial in @entity66 , close to @entity138			0
the @entity139 said it would ' make a contribution ' but would not say how much			0
the @entity97 said it was not allowed to give to charities , despite records showing it has donated to 28 charitable bodies in the past five years			2
a government spokesman said : ' the government does not usually support opening ceremonies for public memorials			0
' however , given the unique circumstances of the @entity3 , an exception has been made in this case			1
sacrifice : 53,573 members of @entity11 were killed during the @entity71 fundraiser @entity44 branded mr @entity1 a hypocrite saying trustees had put their houses on the line to pay for their seat ' the government will make a contribution towards the opening ceremony to help cover the additional costs of seating and security for the many veterans wishing to see the unveiling of this important memorial			1
' this is in addition to £ 1million that the government has already contributed towards the vat costs of the construction of the memorial			2
' @entity176 , minister for defence personnel , welfare and veterans , said : ' the @entity97 has worked very closely with the excellent people of the @entity34 to ensure a successful unveiling of the memorial			2
' we are delighted that a significant number of @entity184 personnel will be involved in the event , providing a flypast by five @entity188 aircraft and a @entity189 from the @entity190 ; ceremonial elements by @entity192 , @entity193 and the @entity194 ; along with ushers , hosts and catering services			0
