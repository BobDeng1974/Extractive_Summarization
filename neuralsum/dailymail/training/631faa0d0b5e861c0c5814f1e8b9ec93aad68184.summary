@entity1 researchers found that high rice consumption , or eating lots of high @entity5 foods , led to good quality sleep if you ca n't sleep at night then it might be worth changing what you have for dinner			1
scientists have discovered that eating lots of rice can trigger a deep slumber , while pasta and noodles can actually hinder sleep			2
the @entity1 researchers also found eating bread products - including white bread , pancakes and pizza - had no effect on the quality of sleep			1
they say eating food high on the glycaemic index ( @entity5 ) - such as rice - was found to be associated with good quality sleep			1
foods with a high @entity5 release sugar in the blood more quickly , leading to spikes in blood sugar levels that can last for a longer time			1
low gi foods , on the other hand , tend to cause small blood sugar rises that do n’t last as long			0
a high @entity5 diet may affect sleep quality because of the effects of tryptophan , an amino acid known for its tranquilising effects and link to the sleep - inducing hormone melatonin			1
this backs up previous research which found eating a meal high in carbohydrate - with a high @entity5 - increased the amount of tryptophan being transported into the brain compared with other amino acids			1
in the brain , tryptophan is converted into serotonin and then to melatonin , which induces sleep			2
according to the study , people in @entity1 consume up to ten times more rice than those in @entity62 and @entity63			2
@entity64 accounts for approximately 28 per cent of the @entity1 people ’s daily energy intake			0
the study analysed data from the annual health examinations of 1,848 factory workers ( 1,164 men and 684 women )			0
the @entity72 in @entity1 requires that employers offer annual health examinations to all of their employees , so this data could be used by researchers			0
the participants also answered a questionnaire in 2003 and a year later in 2004 on health - related behaviours such as their diet , whether they smoked and how much exercise they took			0
to assess the participants ’ sleep quality , researchers used the @entity1 version of the @entity87 , which assesses a person ’s quality of sleep			0
this looked at sleep quality ; the amount of time it took to fall asleep after the lights were turned off , duration , efficiency , disturbances , use of medication and how the workers felt and performed during the day			0
those with a higher rice intake and higher gi intake scored much better on the sleep scale - i.e. they slept well			2
the researchers also found a higher rice and @entity5 intake were linked with better sleep duration			1
higher noodle intake , however , was associated with a more frequent sleep disturbance , higher levels of daytime dysfunction , increased use of sleep medication , poorer subjective sleep quality , and taking longer to get to sleep , they found			0
bread consumption was not found to be linked to sleep quality			2
writing in the study , the researchers said : ‘ the present study indicates that high consumption of rice and a high dietary @entity5 are associated with good sleep , especially good sleep duration			1
' meanwhile , higher noodle consumption is associated with poor sleep quality			0
the effects of starchy foods on sleep may differ according to their gi values			0
' diets with a high - @entity5 , especially those with high rice intake , may contribute to good sleep			1
' the research was published in the journal @entity139			0
experts said that high @entity5 foods might lead to good sleep because of the effect of the amino acid tryptophan ( pictured ) , known to have a tranqilising affect , and sleep - inducing hormone melatonin			1

high rice intake or high @entity5 intake associated with good sleep , study found
but eating a lot of noodles or pasta led to a *bad* night *'s* sleep
bread consumption had no effect on slumber , said @entity1 researchers
foods with high @entity5 release sugar into the blood more quickly
also help more sleep - inducing tryptophan and melatonin enter the brain
