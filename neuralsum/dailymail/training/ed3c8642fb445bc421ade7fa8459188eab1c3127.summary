@entity14 , 28 , from @entity15 , @entity16 , bought the pasty labelled cheese and onion from @entity20			1
@entity21 , three , ate the pasty , which contained meat that is banned in his culture but when his son @entity25 , three , began to eat it he complained about the taste			1

two of the cheese and onion pasties were correctly labelled - but the third one actually contained non-halal minced meat garage worker mr @entity14 , 28 , said : ' it is ridiculous and ignorant of our faith - not just once but twice			1
' firstly they should be far more careful with how they label their products , especially when it could contain meat			2
' but then it is completely wrong of the manager to then give us champagne when @entity2 do n’t drink alcohol			2
' i feel highly insulted			1
i do n’t want this happening to any other people who are @entity2			0

the pasties were marked down to 19p from their usual price of 85p			0
mr @entity14 said : ' i put it down to human error , everybody makes mistakes			0
' but it did n't seem like the manager was really paying attention to the real problem			0
' mrs @entity86 said the pasties were bought for @entity25 and his three older sisters @entity88 , 10 , @entity90 , eight , and @entity91 , four			1
she said : ' i put them in the microwave and gave the first one to @entity25			1
' i heard him moaning a bit and was saying : " it ’s not nice "			0
' i looked at the filling and it was brown meat and potato - he ’s had a couple of bites by then			2
' mrs @entity86 said it was an awful insult to be offered alcohol as compensation for the meat blunder			1
red - faced @entity20 said they were taking the incident seriously and are looking into the error she said : ' the duty manager said we could come and have a bottle of wine or champagne on the house			1

they were ignorant and lazy			0
' red - faced @entity20 said they were taking the incident seriously and are looking into the error			1
a spokesman said : ' clearly this is not good customer service			0
' we apologise for the mistake and any offence caused to mr @entity14 and his family			0
' we take labelling our products very seriously and we are looking into why this particular product was mislabelled			0
' we know we have to be extra careful when labelling meat			2
' we have 11 million people coming to our stores every week and we put this down to human error			0
' as a result of this incident , we will reinforce the training and standards in the store to make sure it does n’t happen again			0
' @entity20 said they are currently in touch with mr @entity14 to discuss a more suitable way of compensating his family			2
halal are foods that @entity2 are allowed to eat or drink under @entity148 shariah law			0
meat must come from a supplier that uses halal practices			2
the slaughter should be performed by a muslim who must start by invoking the name of @entity156 .			0
