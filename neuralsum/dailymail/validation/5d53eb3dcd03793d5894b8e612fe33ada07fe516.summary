olive oil has long been linked with lower levels of cholesterol , blood pressure and a multitude of other health benefits			2
and while food companies have attempted to get it into the diets of more people by adding it to margarine , a team of scientists has gone a step further			2
the @entity16 researchers have discovered a way to convert the liquid state of extra virgin olive oil into a gel , without the need for other solids			1
@entity16 researchers have discovered a way to convert the liquid state of extra virgin olive oil into a gel , without the need for other solids			1
the so - called @entity28 comes in different flavours ( shown above ) known as @entity28 , the food scientists said it can be added to salads and sandwiches , used in cooking and can be flavoured			1
variations include lemon and basil			1
@entity0 ( pictured ) has long been linked with lower levels of cholesterol , blood pressure and a multitude of other health benefits the discovery was made by 10 chemical engineers from the @entity16 @entity44 in the southern town of @entity46			1
they used a technique called ' organogelazione ' which involves subjecting the properties of certain molecules known in the food industry , such as emulsifiers , to a range of temperatures			1
when these molecules are heated and mixed they were found to form new structures			1
the university 's food engineering department headed by professor @entity61 said : ' in this network structure , the oil remains ' trapped ' within the changing texture and transforms itself , in the first stage , into a gel form and , in a second stage , into a creamy spreadable paste			1
' he added that said that this also means it can be produced in various consistencies from a slightly stickier version ideal for dressing salads and other foods to a more solid variation that can be spread like margarine or butter on bread			1
the innovation has been patented and the team said it sees huge potential particularly among people with dietary restrictions or moral objections to dairy products such as vegans			2
the team are now hoping to create a company to sell @entity28 and already developing variations flavoured with lemon and basil			1
@entity94 , one of the researchers of the team , said : ' our idea certainly meets the needs of a new customer profile			2
' people are increasingly being forced to have fast food meals and that means ready to eat products , but at the same time there is reluctance to compromise on quality and taste and our product very much caters to this market			1
' scientists have found olive oil could cut your heart attack risk in just six weeks			2
the study published in november by the @entity115 , found that regular consumption of olive oil dramatically improved chemical signals in the body linked to coronary artery disease			2
it added just 20mls a day – about four teaspoons - to the diet of healthy adults , which is the amount used in a salad dressing or mopped up by bread during a meal			1
but a range of signals for heart disease measured in the urine improved in only six weeks , according to the report published in @entity131			0
scientists have found olive oil could cut your heart attack risk in just six weeks			0
the study , by the @entity115 , found that found regular consumption of olive oil ( pictured ) dramatically improved chemical signals in the body linked to coronary artery disease researchers at the @entity139 and @entity140 and private firm @entity141 in @entity142 investigated the effect of olive oil on heart health in a group of 69 men and women who did not normally eat it			0
the volunteers were split into two groups and asked to consume 20mls of olive oil either low or high in phenolics every day over a six - week period			0
phenolics are natural compounds found in plants , including olives , thought to be responsible for the protective effect of olive oil			0
the research team applied a new diagnostic technology by examining urine samples for a range of peptides ( produced by the breakdown of proteins ) already identified as biomarkers of diseases such as coronary artery disease ( @entity171 )			0
known as proteomics , the technology can pick up altered levels of certain proteins which suggest early signs of disease before symptoms appear			0
the results showed both groups saw a big improvement in scores for @entity171 – the most common form of heart disease			0
dr @entity185 of the @entity186 at @entity115 , said ‘ what we found was that regardless of the phenolic content of the oil , there was a positive effect on @entity171 scores			0
‘ any olive oil , low or high in phenolics , seems to be beneficial			0
‘ our study was a supplementation study			0
if people in the @entity199 replaced part of their fat intake with olive oil , it could have an ever greater effect on reducing the risk of heart disease			0

engineers at the @entity44 , @entity16 , created the *bright* gel
the *experts* heated and mixed molecules to make the new product
@entity28 comes in different consistencies and flavours like basil and lemon
it could be used for salad dressings as well as a sandwich spread
