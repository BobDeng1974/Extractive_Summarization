by @entity0 published : 18:40 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 18:52 est , 15 october 2013 sir @entity1 said bad parenting is at the root of @entity5 's problems parents who fail to teach their children right from wrong are at the root of @entity5 ’s biggest problems , @entity7 ’s chief inspector has said			1
sir @entity1 attacked ‘ hollowed out and fragmented families ’ where parents suffer a ‘ poverty of accountability ’			1
he said child abuse and neglect were not the fault of councils alone			1
such issues were the product of social breakdown			1
sir @entity1 warned that the problems exposed in child abuse scandals were being deepened by an apparent national obsession with ‘ pussyfooting around ’ and ‘ making excuses ’ for bad parents			1
he said many children were ‘ alienated ’ from their natural father and that this lay at the root of the wider problems			2
‘ some people will tell you that social breakdown is the result of material poverty – it ’s more than this , ’ he said			1
‘ these children lack more than money : they lack parents who take responsibility for seeing them raised well			2
it is this poverty of accountability which costs them			0
‘ these children suffer because they are not given clear rules or boundaries , have few secure or safe attachments at home , and little understanding of the difference between right and wrong behaviour			0
‘ if we believe that the family is the great educator – and i certainly do believe that – and the community the great support system , then we as a society should worry deeply about the hollowing out and fragmentation of both			0
’ he spoke as @entity7 ’s first report on @entity69 ’s 152 children ’s services departments found 20 areas where children are poorly protected			0
he said @entity72 was one of the worst places to grow up in the developed world			1
the city recently published a review of the murder of two - year - old @entity79 by his mother in 2011			0
his comments come after a review of the death of two - year - old @entity79 was published sir @entity1 said : ‘ it is an absolute disgrace and government needs to look at this with real urgency			1
' why is it that nearly a third of children in the city live in households on low incomes ? ‘ why is it that infant mortality is almost twice the national average , worse than in @entity99 and on a par with @entity101 and @entity102 ? ‘ these are shocking statistics and a national disgrace			2
they are a testament to failure of corporate governance on a grand scale			0
' what is shocking is that this is the city council with responsibility for more children than any other , our second city , the largest unitary local authority in the country			0
' this is a city that should be nipping at @entity120 ’s heels for power , status and influence			0
’ ' sir @entity1 said children ’s services had been undermined because one in three of the country ’s departmental directors have either quit or been sacked in the past year – 50 out of the total of 152			1
‘ @entity130 and ineffective leadership must be addressed quickly , ’ he added			0
‘ but where those in leadership positions have capacity and potential , this must be recognised and nurtured			0
’ the report found 86 of the 152 councils had children ’s services that were ‘ less than good ’			0
the 20 judged inadequate were @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity72 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 on @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160			2
a spokesman for @entity72 council said : ‘ this is a long - standing problem which we acknowledge			2
‘ while we can only agree with the seriousness of what sir @entity1 has said – indeed we have said it ourselves – we now need improvement rather than further diagnosis			1
