doubles : @entity1 with two fans of the dolls when they appeared on @entity7 ’ den to drum up investment in their range of lookalike children ’s dolls , the verdict of the millionaire entrepreneurs was a humiliating ‘ no ’			1
mother and son @entity1 and @entity13 were told in no uncertain terms that the business they had sunk their every penny into was ‘ unviable ’ – and were advised to quit			1
but now they have proved the @entity7 wrong , landing a £ 100,000 deal with toy store @entity20			1
the pair were derided by all five tycoons when they sought investment for their £ 65 @entity24 – a 18in figure which children can customise to make ‘ mini-me ’ versions of themselves			1
design guru @entity29 told them : ‘ this is not a viable business i would want to put my money into			0
’ and mobile phone boss @entity34 warned : ‘ do not spend another pound taking this forward			0
’ the pair , who wanted a £ 75,000 investment , left the den brokenhearted			1
mrs @entity1 , 45 , said : ‘ @entity40 was absolutely devastating – one of the most humiliating experiences of my life			2
but the rejection by the @entity7 made both of us even more determined to succeed , whatever the odds			2
’ the order from @entity20 marks a reversal in the company ’s fortunes – and could place my @entity52 in the list of successful ideas rejected by the tv experts , including the @entity58 suitcase , ‘ cup - a - wine ’ and @entity59			1
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ @entity20 made an initial order of 100 dolls plus outfits which sold out			1
so this week they ordered 500 more – and told us they will need at least a further 500 dolls plus accessories by @entity67			0
the whole order is worth around £ 100,000 and they ’re worried we wo n’t be able to make them fast enough			0
’ mrs @entity1 , from @entity70 , set up the company in 2011 after a visit to the @entity73 , where she bought a doll for her daughter , @entity75 , now 11 , which ‘ looked so much like her ’			2
she said : ‘ i knew i was taking a gamble but i took redundancy from my lecturing job , putting the £ 20,000 pay - off into the business			2
a further £ 40,000 came from remortgaging the house , £ 20,000 from a bank loan and the rest was made up of savings			0
it amounted to £ 120,000 to make hundreds of dolls , matching clothes children can buy to wear themselves , plus storage			1
’ sitting pretty : @entity102 , creator of the @entity58 , sits on top of his invention at home in @entity106 she says she knew their appearance on the show in september last year , was doomed to failure as soon as they gave ms @entity29 one of their dolls			2
‘ i ’d had it specially made with curly hair like @entity29 ’s , ’ she recalls , ‘ but although @entity119 seemed impressed with her lookalike , @entity29 seemed terrified by hers and hid it under her chair			0
’ worse was to come			0
‘ when @entity126 said “ it ’s not going to be a great business ” , my heart sank , ’ she says			0
‘ at the time we were only selling three dolls a week			0
no one seemed interested that we were a brand - new start - up			0
’ ms @entity119 was concerned no shop would have enough shelf space to show the 133 types of dolls , while internet tycoon @entity136 agreed that the amount of stock would ‘ keep me awake at night ’			2
mrs @entity1 , married to engineer @entity143 , 47 , said : ‘ the @entity7 made us look like fools			1
although i realise their blunt comments made good tv , it was a crushing blow			0
but our passion for the dolls and belief the @entity7 were wrong kept us going			1
and , to the @entity148 ’ surprise , shortly before the show was broadcast , @entity20 confirmed they were interested			1
‘ the buyer had no idea about @entity7 ’ @entity153 , ’ she added			1
‘ we are delighted that our toys are stocked in such an amazing shop			0

all five @entity158 tycoons rejected @entity1 and son @entity159 *'s* idea
but they landed big - money deal with @entity20 just before *episode* aired
dolls cost £ 65 and are modelled to look like children who buy them
pair asked for a £ 75,000 investment on show but left brokenhearted
*latest* in a number of success stories to slip through @entity7 ' *fingers*
