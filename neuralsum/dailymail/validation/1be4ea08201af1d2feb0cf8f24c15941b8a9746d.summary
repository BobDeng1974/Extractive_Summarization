@entity0 is willing to break with convention and give @entity2 the lion 's share of any payday in an effort to finally lure him into a blockbuster world title fight			1
@entity0 has the bargaining chip of a world championship belt but so far that has proved ineffective in drawing the @entity10 welterweight into a fight that would attract huge @entity13 interest			1
@entity14 understands @entity2 would pocket in the region of £ 4 million if he met the 28 - year - old at @entity17 on june 13 – a date @entity0 's promoter , @entity18 , has penciled in with the national stadium			1
@entity20 world welterweight champion @entity0 poses at a press conference at @entity22 , @entity23 @entity2 hits @entity24 during their welterweight bout at the @entity27 last year @entity2 chats to @entity29 midfielder and fellow @entity31 ambassador @entity30 in a promo @entity0 has gone to claim he would be prepared to accept a smaller payday as @entity20 champion to make the fight			1
but despite sporadic positive feedback from the @entity2 camp , who told @entity18 at a recent meeting in @entity41 that the bout ' will happen one day ' , the trail has since gone cold			1
@entity0 , who defends his title on march 28 against @entity44 , said : ' i think he is avoiding me like the plague			2
he said that i 'm an easy fight but how long have we been banging on about wanting the fight with him ? ' after i 'm done with @entity2 he will just be a mere memory			1
' he wants to fight some of these kids who have been super-featherweights			0
i am a genuine big welterweight who can seek and destroy him			0
' @entity18 added : ' we want the fight so badly			1
we do n't believe we should take anything less than 50 - 50 but until we talk maybe we do			0
@entity0 has not been in a mega-fight and has masses of monster paydays in front of him			2
if he has to give @entity2 a little something to knock him out he probably will			2
' @entity2 's fight in @entity23 on march 28 will be his first since the horrific stabbing incident in @entity65 last september that could have cost his life			1
at the very least it has meant a major delay in @entity0 defending his world title for the first time			2
he intends on three more fights this year , though he believes he has a greater chance of attracting the winner of @entity75 's showdown with @entity76 than he does of landing a @entity2 bout that would draw enormous domestic interest			1
@entity0 hits the bag during a media workout session at @entity81 in @entity82 in august 2014 @entity0 lands a punch on @entity84 on his way to becoming world champion in august 2014 @entity2 's apparent interest in fighting @entity89 's @entity88 would indicate that @entity0 is low on his agenda , with @entity0 saying : ' i think it is more likely i will end up fighting one of @entity75 or @entity76 than @entity2 , the way he is dragging his feet			1
a @entity2 fight is so easy to make			2
all the signs are there for it to be an unbelievable fight			0
' i have seen clips of him saying , ' win a world title ' , ' do this , do that '			0
i have come through everything he has said and still nothing			0
' i think people around him are blowing smoke up his * * * * and he is believing all the hype			0
do n't get me wrong he is a good fighter but i would take him out			0
' we are ready to go with this fight			0
but i will fight anyone			0
i have only wanted to fight the very best			0
before i leave this fight i want to get in with the best			0
' @entity18 told @entity14 earlier this week that discussions have started over a possible summer fight for @entity0 against @entity120 or @entity121 , who are both former world champions			1
@entity88 trades punches with @entity124 during their match in @entity82 earlier this year			2

@entity0 will offer @entity2 the majority of the purse should they fight
the @entity20 welterweight champion has so far not managed to tempt @entity2
@entity14 understands @entity2 could pocket in the region of £ *4m* if he accepts
@entity0 's promoter @entity18 says he is desperate for the fight to happen
however , it appears @entity2 would prefer to face @entity89 @entity88
