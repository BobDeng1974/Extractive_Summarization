off course : @entity0 has had an awful year , culminating in his missing the cut at the @entity32 pain : the 14 - time major champion has been plagued by back problems this year but @entity0 , who earlier this month pulled out of the @entity72 at @entity73 in order to let his back recover , has decided to part company with one of the most sought - after swing coaches in the world			1
@entity0 is not scheduled to play until his own tournament in @entity81 in the first week of december and has used his break from the course to change a key man in his team			0
' with my next tournament not until my @entity88 event at @entity90 in @entity91 , this is the right time to end our professional relationship , ' added @entity0			2
@entity20 's splits from both @entity10 and @entity11 have ended in acrimony but @entity1 insisted that the duo are parting on good terms			2
' my time spent with @entity0 is one of the highlights of my career so far , and i am appreciative of the many experiences we shared together , ' @entity1 said in a statement			1
' it was a lifelong ambition of mine to teach the best player of all - time in our sport			2
i am both grateful for the things we had the opportunity to learn from one another , as well as the enduring friendship we have built			0
i have nothing but respect and admiration for him			0
' video @entity0 leaves @entity1 @entity121 : @entity0 winces as he completes a drive at the @entity34 @entity32 earlier this month despite his six - year duck in majors , @entity0 did enjoy a superb year in 2013 in which he won five times			1
despite that success , @entity0 's struggles with his driver in particular have been all too obvious , which has earned @entity1 some stern criticism			1
@entity132 commentator @entity131 , a former @entity133 player , has been a notable critic , even accusing @entity0 of developing the ' yips ' with his driver			0
@entity10 , who was @entity0 's coach during the star 's ' @entity136 ' of four successive major wins from the @entity139 to the @entity140 , reacted to the news by defending @entity1			1
' in @entity1 ’s defense , i had the easiest job in my 10 years , ' said @entity10			0
' he was the healthiest			0
@entity1 had the hardest job			0
' @entity146 also backed his coach during an interview with the @entity132 ’s @entity149 in @entity65 last week			0
‘ i think with @entity0 they ’ve had to work around a lot of things , ’ he said			0
