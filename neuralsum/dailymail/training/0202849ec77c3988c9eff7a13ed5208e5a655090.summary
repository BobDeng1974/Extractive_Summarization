defendant : @entity1 was accused of flashing her bra at an officer and ' seductively ' leaned towards him a @entity5 who developed an ‘ unhealthy interest ’ in a gay male colleague repeatedly slapped his bottom and spied on him getting changed , a court heard yesterday			1
@entity1 , 50 , also allegedly flashed her bra at the young officer and behaved ‘ seductively ’ towards him in a lift while on duty			1
@entity1 is accused of spanking his bottom six times as he and another colleague were moving a filing cabinet at their central @entity19 police station in august last year			1
jurors heard a colleague also caught the @entity5 peering at him while he changed , in scenes reminiscent of 1960 @entity25 film @entity26			2
the pair were employed as @entity28 for a safer neighbourhoods team in north @entity19 when the incident took place on august 18 last year			1
@entity32 , prosecuting , said : ‘ the prosecution say that she slapped him a number of times on his buttocks and that those slaps were sexual in nature			2
miss @entity1 took an unhealthy and , you may think , an odd interest in her colleague			1
' that interest was demonstrated by a number of incidents which occurred earlier that year			2
the safer neighbourhoods team on which both of these people worked was , in the early part of 2013 , a small group of @entity28 based at an office			1
their changing room was a single room divided down the middle by a row of lockers			2
’ the room was split into male and female areas and @entity1 would peer around a locker door and stare at the complainant while he was changing , the court heard			1
mr @entity32 added : ‘ shortly after @entity63 joined the team , he was getting changed in this room when he became aware of somebody watching him			2
‘ it was @entity63 and she was standing a few feet away with her face half covered by another person ’s locker , peering around it watching him			2
’ he caught her staring at him while changing four times , jurors heard ‘ on one occasion he was again getting changed in the locker room when miss @entity1 walked around from her side of it , the female changing side , with her shirt undone and her bra exposed			1
‘ when he asked her what she was doing she replied “ oh , it ’s that time of the month , i ’m not quite with it ” , ’ explained mr @entity32			2
cleared : @entity5 @entity1 , 50 , has been cleared of sexual assault after a colleague accused her of spanking his backside six times			1
tonight jurors were still undecided on a lesser charge of common assault ‘ male ’ and ‘ female ’ signs were put up in the changing rooms after the officer complained about @entity1 ’s behaviour , it was alleged			1
‘ around march or april 2013 he was working at the team computer and he felt her hands grip his shoulder and it was miss @entity1 ’s hands ’ , said mr @entity32			1
‘ when he told her to let go of him she said he looked tense and she told him she would give him a massage			2
a week or so later he and @entity63 were asked to conduct a visit to a block of flats ... and they had to take the lifts			2
‘ as soon as the door to the lift closed and the lift started moving miss @entity1 leaned provocatively against the walls of the lift , raised her arms above the buttons of the control panel , leaned towards him and said “ i know why you ’re taking me to the fourth floor ” , ’ said mr @entity32			1
in june the team moved to a different office where @entity1 again grasped him by the shoulders as he was working at the computer , jurors heard			1
on 18 august the alleged victim said he was spanked after being asked to help move a large cabinet			2
@entity1 was holding the doors open while the other @entity28 lifted the cabinet up two flights of stairs			1
‘ as he had hold of this piece of furniture , he felt once again the defendant ’s hands on his shoulders and he told her to get off him and open the door ’ , said mr @entity32			2
‘ a few seconds later she slapped him three or four times firmly on his buttocks			2
he told her to stop and the defendant then slapped him once more on the buttocks before stopping			0
‘ all this attention was completely unwanted by him			0
as it happens , he is gay and it was upsetting and intimidating for him ... everyone , their colleagues , knew about it			0
that attention upset and intimidated him ’			0
@entity1 ’s unsolicited spanking was the ‘ final straw ’ and he then reported the matter , the court heard			1
but the @entity5 denies spanking the officer			1
trial : @entity1 denies sexual assault and an alternative count of assault by beating at @entity159 addressing the jurors , mr @entity32 added : ‘ i would ask you how you would feel about this case if the genders were reversed - if this was a 50 - year - old man making advances towards a young woman culminating in him slapping her on the bottom a few times			1
’ later the alleged victim told jurors @entity1 would speak to plants and dogs while on duty			1
' we would got out on patrol , we would walk a few stops forward and @entity176 would stop and she would be stroking a leaf and she would be talking to it , ' he said			0
and he claimed she ' never ' talked to dog owners but ' just the dog '			0
he said their working relationship was ' okay ' but made him paranoid after he caught her watching him			0
' when she first started it was okay then there became an issue in the locker room			0
it was kind of weird and made me feel a little bit paranoid i guess , ' he said			0
he told jurors that on one occasion he had seen her peering from behind the locker as he changed			0
' it threw me , i have never had someone watch me like that , ' he said			0
on another occasion @entity1 started to strip in front of her colleague , it was claimed			1
' she came round with her top undone revealing her bra and i said “ @entity176 , what are you doing ” and she said “ forgive me , it is the time of the month ” , and went round the other side			2
' @entity1 's advances culminated in her allegedly slapping his backside while he was struggling to lift a filing cabinet			1
he said : ' i felt three big spanks on my bottom			0
' i was really shocked and i was like “ oh my god ” under my breath			0
i told her “ stop , can you just stop and open the doors ” and she continued - and i think there was about two or three more afterwards			0
' he told the court he saw @entity1 poised behind his bottom with an open palm			1
' it was hard enough to leave a mark when i got changed that day there was still a mark there which was about an hour or maybe two hours after			0
' ' she came round with her top undone revealing her bra and i said “ @entity176 , what are you doing ” and she said “ forgive me , it is the time of the month ” , and went round the other side ' alleged victim fellow pcso @entity237 said @entity1 turned red as she launched her palm at her colleague 's buttocks			1
' what i saw was her elbow come backwards and as it came forwards i have heard a connection , so i have heard the slaps			0
i heard five occasions of that one after another			0
' her face went red , it looked like she was putting a lot of effort into it and i did think that 's got to hurt			0
it was n't in a playful manner , there was exertion put into it			0
' i was looking at him and his face was pure and utter shock , he did n't quite understand what had happened			0
' he was looking at me , mouth slightly gaped and i was looking back at him with probably the same expression or surprise at what had happened			0
’ miss @entity237 said her relationship with @entity1 was ' fractious ' and admitted she thinks @entity1 has ' underlying issues that need addressing '			1
' you think she is slow , ' asked @entity271 , defence counsel			0
' that 's correct , ' replied miss @entity237			0
but ms @entity237 denied wanting to get rid of @entity1 despite confessing they did not get on in the work place			1
@entity1 's boss , retired police sergeant @entity275 , said the alleged victim was tearful when he approached him for a chat about the spanking			1
' he was quite distressed , he found it difficult to talk to me and he was a bit tearful and he was welling up and he was a bit embarrassed , ' he said			0
' you would clearly have understood that this was a man struggling to tell me something			0
he told me that @entity176 had inappropriately touched his bottom on that sunday			0
' @entity1 denies sexual assault and an alternative count of assault by beating			1
