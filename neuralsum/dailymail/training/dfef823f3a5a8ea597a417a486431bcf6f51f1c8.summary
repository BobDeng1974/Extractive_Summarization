by @entity0 published : 10:41 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 05:10 est , 13 november 2013 a planning consultant has seen his career destroyed after he repaired the roof of his fire - damaged thatched home without securing planning permission			1
@entity6 lived with his family in a mobile home for months after his 17th - century thatched cottage was ravaged in a fire			1
after receiving an insurance payout , he proceeded to repair the @entity13 - listed building - but was then told that he had breached planning laws			2
home : @entity6 has been fined for repairing his @entity13 - listed home after it was damaged by a fire he was fined £ 1,000 as well as paying £ 3,000 in costs - and now the 37 - year - old says he will not be able to find work because no one will hire a planner who has committed a planning offence			1
mr @entity6 's house in @entity27 , a village near @entity28 in @entity29 , was seriously damaged by fire in may 2011			1
as well as being forced out of his home , he had to stop working for a time because the fire destroyed his computer and shut off all the telecoms connections			1
he used insurance funds to replace unsafe roof timbers with modern timbers made from green oak			2
but @entity39 - where mr @entity6 himself used to work - ruled that the repairs ' affected the building 's character '			1
blaze : mr @entity6 and his family were forced to live in a mobile home for months after the 2011 fire the homeowner claimed that he did not need to secure planning permission because the repairs did not drastically alter the appearance of the cottage			1
however , he decided to admit to breaking regulations in order to avoid the expense of a trial			1
' we lost nearly everything on one side of the house , ' mr @entity6 said			1
' we were fighting every step for a payout from the insurance company			0
i was left in a position where i had to fix the house myself			2
' i have done the minimal work required			0
you can class these timbers , with appropriate joining techniques , as repairs			0
' i feel proud of what i have done , and proud as a family how we have held ourselves together			0
it was a lot of effort and a lot of money			0
' damage : many of the timbers in the roof had to be repaired following the blaze , mr @entity6 says repairs : the planning consultant failed to obtain permission for the work he carried out - and paid the price he added : ' i have lost my career , everything i trained for			1
the hardest part is not having the ability to work			0
' @entity91 , @entity28 's councillor responsible for planning , said : ' we take the conservation of our listed buildings very seriously and we will not hesitate to prosecute those who ignore these very specific building requirements			2
' but mr @entity6 said there was no need for the council to be so heavy - handed in his case			2
' if i was a builder or trying to make a profit , or you ask for consent and the council say no and you do it maliciously , i could understand prosecution , ' he said			0
' the council can offer you a formal caution , but decided it wanted to make an example of me			0
you feel like you are being bullied			0
' he says he is planning to appeal against the decision with the ombudsman .			0

@entity6 , 37 , had his @entity29 home damaged in a fire in may 2011
he repaired the roof with new timber but did not seek planning permission
thought he did **n't** need it as changes did **n't** alter the house 's appearance
he decided to admit to planning offences to avoid the expense of a trial
now he has been fined £ 1,000 and fears he will not be able to work again
