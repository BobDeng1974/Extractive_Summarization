a @entity1 reporter has revealed her battle with skin cancer after becoming addicted to tanning and using sunbeds			1
@entity6 has now called for high street sunbed shops to be banned after a new programme hosted by the reporter branded them as harmful as cigarettes and alcohol			1
the 39 - year - old , who carried out the investigation for @entity16 , believes it was her over-tanning that caused the disease			1
@entity1 reporter @entity6 , who has revealed her battle with skin cancer after claiming she became addicted to tanning and using sunbeds			1
she is pictured after receiving her diagnosis of malignant melanoma in the episode of the @entity1 investigative show @entity27 , to be broadcast on monday , miss @entity6 walks 19 - year - old @entity28 through the dangers of sunbed usage			1
@entity28 works in a tanning salon and regularly uses its services			2
miss @entity6 said : ' i just wanted to shake her and say ' please , do n't keep doing this '			2
she looks beautiful on the outside but underneath , who knew what damage she was doing to herself			0
the worst skin to go underneath sunbeds or in the sun is pale skin and blue eyes , which is what she 's got			2
she 's a carbon copy of me when i was 19			0
we did n't know before we started how much damage she had done but i really wanted to make her think			2
' miss @entity6 was inspired to make the film for the @entity1 after recovering from her own cancer , which was diagnosed in february last year			1
she was determined to educate people on the dangers of using sunbeds and of tanning in general			2
she said : ' you read the papers and you hear peoples ' stories that they spend thousands a month on tanning			2
i read one article from a girl who said that even if she got skin cancer she would still go on sunbeds			1
miss @entity6 , pictured before being diagnosed with skin cancer , says she first started using sunbeds at the age of 16 and soon became addicted to having a tan ' if she could go through one day of what i 've been through she would totally take that comment back			1
people do n't think of skin cancer as a serious type of cancer , they think they can just get it cut out and move on , you go through hell			1
' i really , really , really want to hit home to people that just for the sake of a tan , you are risking your life			0
' miss @entity6 first began using sunbeds at the age of 16 , when her family would hire a home sunbed once every three weeks for about a week at a time			1
it triggered a 20 - year addiction to tanning , for ten of which she was using sunbeds almost daily			1
after being diagnosed with skin cancer and now being in recovery , pictured , miss @entity6 always covers up , even on the beach on holiday she said : ' i 'm convinced it started was when my older brother had hired a sunbed at home , we used to have them brought to the house and dropped off			1
i thought i would just pop under and have a go			0
' it was one where you put it over your bed and you hop in and you do one side and then the other side and i just thought ' this is lovely and warm and i 've got a bit of a glow '			0
' i believe uv rays do promote serotonin , which is a happy hormone			0
i 've always been pale growing up , i think you just try it one and you like it , you try it again and you like it and you do it more and more			0
i really was addicted , you just ca n't buy that feeling in a tonic			2
' you start to see yourself in the mirror and think you like to have a healthy glow			0
i eventually thought i did n't look like me anymore when i was pale , so i kept on going			0
' she hopes her report will help educate others on the dangers and allow them to avoid the mistakes she made			2
she added : ' it was never pointed out by a professional person or anyone who worked in the tanning salons or who dropped the sunbeds off at home but my mum used to say to me ' @entity6 , what damage are you doing to your skin ? ' ' my dad is pale too and he would tell me i would damage my skin in years to come but it just made me feel good and when i started working on the radio i was office based and i had a lunch hour every day and i would pop off to use a sunbed in my lunch hour			1
' my colleagues used to say : ' @entity6 , what are you doing ? ' it was standing joke at work , whenever i went on holiday , they would ask ' what shade are you aiming for ? ' and i would say mahogany			2
lots of people around me were saying things but it took me getting a devastating diagnosis for me to actually stop and for it to hit home			0
' i 'm not blaming anybody , i chose to do that but what i have got an issue with is that i was never given an informed choice			0
' not once in all the ten years i was using tanning beds did anyone ever say to me , you 've got pale skin and blue eyes be careful what you do with your skin , or that if you do too much you might get skin cancer			1
' there was no warning signs in the shop of anything			0
a lot more education is needed , especially with young people			0
' with more than 11,000 new cases of malignant melanoma in the @entity182 each year , miss @entity6 believes tanning salons are a significant contributor to this			1
the @entity187 reporter has now carried out an investigation for @entity16 , where she looks into the dangers of tanning			2
she is pictured receiving a spray tan after recovering from skin cancer official guidance across the @entity194 sets a maximum @entity196 intensity to be used by commercial sunbeds			1
this figure must be adhered to by all members of the @entity200			0
however , with only 20 per cent of the industry affiliated to this body , miss @entity6 thinks it would be safer for sunbeds to be banned entirely until a tougher regulatory system is put in place			2
research funded by @entity208 revealed that out of 400 sunbeds tests , 90 per cent had uv light intensities exceeding the @entity194 recommended limit , sometimes up to double			2
miss @entity6 added : ' it 's like cigarettes and alcohol , people have their vices			1
cigarettes come with a health warning , so does alcohol but sunbeds do n't and i totally think they are on par. it 's a hot topic of discussion but i totally think sunbeds should at least come with a warning that they can cause cancer			1
' some people will say if you use them responsibly you will be fine but sunbeds are so open to abuse and the majority of them are not regulated			0
during her programme for the @entity1 , miss @entity6 meets 19 - year - old @entity28 , pictured , who works in a tanning salon and regularly uses its services during the show , the pair visit @entity236 , where @entity28 's skin is analysed to see how much tanning is affecting her face ' so , if there was a proper regulation and licencing program then that would be great but until then , and that 's a long way off , i would like to see them banned			1
' this is a call echoed by @entity249 , a skin cancer expert and miss @entity6 's consultant			1
he told the @entity16 programme : ' i would definitely like to see sunbeds banned			0
because the uv radiation has a significant risk of patients developing melanoma [ skin cancer ]			1
' and speaking to @entity261 , he added : ' as a consultant at @entity263 [ cancer centre ] , i see first - hand the harm that uv radiation does to the skin and the impact that melanoma has on patients			1
sadly , despite our best efforts , many people do not survive melanoma			0
' therefore , i believe there is a strong case for sunbed use to be controlled more strongly and personally would like to see them prohibited			0
' but @entity279 , chairman of the @entity200 , said : ' our members have followed a strict @entity281 for more than 20 years with requirements that exceed the current calls for extended legislation which @entity285 was a full participant in and which we fully support			0
a computer analysis of @entity28 's skin shows how much it has aged through using sunbeds as part of the @entity16 programme ' when interviewed by @entity6 , i provided her with the evidence that clearly demonstrated there is categorically no scientific data to support a link between professional sunbed use and melanoma , it is purely and simply a statistically skewed myth			1
' responsible sunbed use in a salon in membership of the @entity200 is an entirely safe way to tan for those people who can tan and want to tan			0
' the research about sunbeds emitting higher intensity levels was conducted in 2011 which was around the same time that the new emission level regulation came into effect			0
if that research was undertaken today the results would be completely different			0
we know this as fact from our own research covering thousands of sunbeds , activity undertaken by local authorities and the fact that compliant sunbeds tube sales have risen by more than 500 per cent			0
' the episode of @entity1 @entity27 featuring miss @entity6 's report will be broadcast on monday at 7.30pm on @entity16 ( @entity323 )			1
it will also be available on the @entity325 .			0
