stunning ! miss @entity34 , who 's 28 , grew up in @entity8 before moving to @entity107 to pursue acting size is just a number ! ms @entity1 was doing someone else 's makeup during a fashion shoot when a photographer spotted her and asked if she 'd be interested in pursuing modeling herself miss @entity34 's entrance into modeling came rather late by industry standards - and she initially thought she wanted to be a actress ( an aspiration she is still pursuing )			1

miss @entity34 is happy that she inspires so many women - and hopes that her shape does n't remain an anomaly in an industry typically marked by rail - thin women			1

' my amazing mother and grandparents raised me to fall in love with me and accept myself as no one else will			0
if you share that confident energy with those around you then everyone else will catch on			0
