by @entity0 published : 15:25 est , 17 february 2013 updated : 15:26 est , 17 february 2013 zookeepers in @entity2 could be set to hear the pitter patter of tiny feet soon with the @entity6 's only two giant pandas likely to be ready to breed within the next month			0
experts believe that @entity8 and @entity9 , who arrived at @entity10 in a blaze of publicity in 2011 , could mate within weeks			1
the pair are said to have already started showing important changes in their behavour			2
mating season : giant pandas @entity8 , left , and @entity9 , right , could be ready to mate according to experts at @entity10 male @entity9 has been spotted doing handstands against trees , walls and rocks and scent - marking as high up as possible - known as a display of virility in the wild - while @entity8 has already started calling out to him - a common sign during breeding season			1
zookeepers can usually tell when pandas are likely to mate through a combination of behavourial observation and hormone testing			0
but no hormonal changes have been seen in either panda as yet			2
@entity10 - where the pandas have lived since their arrival from @entity35 in december 2011 - has employed a number of measures to synchronise the breeding cycles of the pandas , including controlled lighting , urine testing for hormone levels and enclosure swapping			1
relaxing : @entity8 stretches in her enclosure at @entity10			1
female pandas are in season for just 48 hours @entity47 changes : @entity9 has started doing handstands and scent - marking - a tell tale sign that he is ready to mate say experts they were first introduced to each other last april but did not end up fully mating			1
female pandas are in season for less than 48 hours			0
@entity54 , director of giant pandas and strategic innovations for the @entity57 , said : ' we 're delighted that both @entity8 and @entity9 have started to scent mark and call , both clear behavioural indicators of courtship and mating behaviour			1
' although both giant pandas are showing these changes in their behaviour , it is still early days yet and way too early to give any accurate prediction on timings , however , early indicators do suggest the breeding season will probably fall in march this year			2
acquainted : @entity8 and @entity9 peer through the fence at each other from their enclosures at @entity10 ' in reality we could be as little as four weeks away , although equally the big day could still be as far off as eight weeks			1
' this year we will combine both natural and assisted reproduction methods			0
' this follows the best practice methodology adopted by other panda - keeping zoos around the world and gives our giant pandas the best possible chance of success			2
' celebrities : the two pandas arrived at the zoo in a fanfare of celebration from @entity35 in december 2011 the pair arrived at @entity10 amid much excitement in december 2011			1
during their first year at the zoo , @entity8 , meaning ' sweetie ' , and @entity9 , which means ' @entity95 ' , brought in half a million visitors and an extra Â£ 3million revenue			1
they will stay in @entity2 for at least another nine years			0
ready to mate : @entity8 although pandas are generally thought of as poor breeders , that is a mistaken theory based on animals in captivity			2
experts say that wild pandas have a reproduction rate similar to the @entity108 black bear which is thriving			0
giant pandas reach sexual maturity at between five - and - a - half and six - and - a - half years old			0
a female can mate with several males who compete with one another to mate with her while a male panda will seek out different females who are on heat			1
the mating season for giant pandas generally falls between march and may but a female is in season for less than 48 hours			0
males and females normally only associate for between two and four days and the female is pregnant for between 95 and 160 days			0
pandas normally give birth to a single baby , but multiple births are possible if artificial insemination is used in captivity			0
they produce offspring roughly once every two years			0
