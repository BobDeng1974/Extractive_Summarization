local residents have complained that the decision has left the historic city centre looking ' dark and depressing ' with some saying it reminds them of the war days			1
but @entity16 , @entity17 leader , insists leaving the high street without @entity5 lights is the right thing to do in the face of its growing budget crisis			1
protest : traders have staged protests after @entity17 refused to spend money on @entity5 lights for the high street the council has been ordered to make savings of £ 5.5million by 2017 , and cutting the funding for illuminations will spare £ 56,000 - but traders are furious at the council 's attitude			1
the @entity35 city is home to @entity37 - the most important place of worship in the @entity40 - where the archbishop of @entity3 , leader of the @entity2 delivers his @entity5 sermon on christmas day			1

it 's the most important time of year for them			0
' but without any @entity5 lights , the city just looks dull , dark and depressing			2
one pensioner told me it felt like the war , all over again			0
' he said he fears customers will go to the nearby shopping centre in @entity78 as it 's more appealing with ' fantastic @entity5 lights '			1
' traders have told me that trade is much worse than last @entity5 and it 's a real worry , ' he said			0
meanwhile campaigner @entity83 organised a protest march through the city last weekend to put pressure on the council to reverse its decision			0
he said : ' a lot of people are dismayed about the lack of @entity5 lights			2
the council have underspent by nearly £ 1million this year , so why ca n't they afford some lights ? ' only the @entity96 precinct and the @entity97 in @entity3 have lights to lift the mood			2
these have been funded privately , although a grant from the council was put towards the display in independent traders ' area @entity97			2
a local business has paid for a christmas tree in the city centre , with the council paying around £ 2,000 to decorate it			2
darkness : @entity3 high street appears ' dark and depressing ' compared to other town centres , which are festooned with @entity5 lights disgrace : traders have labelled the decision a ' public disgrace ' , and pensioner said the darkness made it feel ' like the war ' mr @entity43 added : ' i looked into the costs of hiring and putting up @entity5 lights in the high street , but the public liability insurance would have cost £ 7,000 , making it prohibitively expensive			1
' the council has the money , but they do n't want to celebrate @entity5			0
instead they 've squirreled away £ 103,000 for re-paving an area of the city that does not need repaving and they 've set aside £ 17,000 to refurbish the lord mayor 's robes			0
' does anyone even care about the lord mayor 's robes ? i know most people here would prefer to have some @entity5 lights			0
' cradle of @entity48 : the city is home to @entity37 where the archbishop of @entity3 , leader of the @entity2 delivers his @entity5 sermon on december 25 a spokesman from @entity17 said that start - up grants totalling around £ 10,000 have been given to community and business groups in @entity147 and @entity148 to help them take over the organisation of the lights in their towns			1
councillor @entity16 said : ' it was inevitable that this day would come			0
christmas lights were a nice thing to do when we had money , but now they are not of sufficient quality to make a difference and there is simply no cash to invest in new displays			1
' instead of persisting with something sub-standard , the only option left is to stop doing it			0
lit up : some areas of @entity3 , including the @entity96 precint , will remain lit up , and a local business has paid for a christmas tree in the city centre ( file photo ) rival : traders fear that shoppers will instead turn to @entity78 shopping centre in @entity176 ' much has been said in the media and elsewhere about cuts in council funding			1
this is one very real example of its impact ' he added : ' as the money goes down , we are going to have to take more difficult decisions not to do things , in order to protect important frontline services and the services we are required to provide by law			0
