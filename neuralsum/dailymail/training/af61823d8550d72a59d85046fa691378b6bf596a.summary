@entity0 , head of the @entity1 , said the system of organising @entity4 surgeries outside of hospitals is ' past its used - by date ' hospitals will be urged to open up in - house @entity10 surgeries to make it easier for patients to get appointments			1
@entity0 , the head of the @entity1 , says the move could ease the strain for practices where there are too few doctors and rising numbers of patients			1
the surgeries would be different from the walk - in centres and urgent care units that already exist in some hospitals alongside @entity26 units			1
they would operate as a normal surgery with their own list of patients			2
addressing the @entity32 ’ annual conference in @entity34 today , mr @entity0 will say that the traditional system of surgeries in villages and towns being totally separate from hospitals is ‘ past its used - by date ’			1
the proposals would open up more practices , making it easier for patients to register with a gp and get an appointment			1
but importantly , they would also enable family doctors to speak more easily with specialist consultants and confer about the best care for their patients			0
mr @entity0 is expected to say : ‘ alongside more doctors and more funding , we also need new and better ways of caring for patients , especially older patients at home			1
‘ gps themselves say that in many parts of the country the corner shop model of primary care is past its used - by date			1
‘ we need to tear up the design flaw in the 1948 @entity1 model where family doctors were organised entirely separately from hospital specialists and where patients with chronic health conditions are increasingly passed from pillar to post between different bits of health and social services			0
’ only yesterday the @entity32 warned that 550 surgeries could close over the next year because so many family doctors are over 60 and nearing retirement			2
but there are few younger doctors coming up to replace them as the profession is regarded as unpopular			0
@entity88 said from next year practices would be able to apply for extra funding to enable them to stay open on saturdays and sundays			0
but gps say the plans wo n’t work as they are overstretched coping with a declining workforce and rising population			0
dr @entity96 , chairman of the @entity32 , said extra investment was needed just to keep the system afloat			2
speaking yesterday to @entity99 ’s today programme she added : ‘ we do have a workforce crisis in general practice			0
‘ we ’ve been losing gps , we are losing gps and we ’re not recruiting enough doctors into the profession			0
’ meanwhile health secretary @entity108 has launched a review to determine how many extra gps are needed and which areas in the country are particularly lacking in doctors			1
it will be overseen by @entity115 , the body responsible for education and training of the @entity1 workforce , and is likely to look at ways of encouraging more younger doctors to become gps			0
health secretary @entity108 has launched a review to determine how many extra gps are needed and which areas in the country are particularly lacking but @entity4 have accused mr @entity108 of ‘ constantly denigrating ’ the profession and turning patients against them			1
dr @entity129 , 38 , a gp from @entity130 in @entity131 , told the @entity32 conference : ‘ we are exhausted , drowning , and quite frankly furious with you , what are you going to do about it ? ’ she said patients were increasingly contacting gps about trivial complaints			0
‘ they want a note from the doctor to join their gym , to travel on @entity143 or get a referral to a homeopath , ’ she said			0
‘ i ’ve even known of cases where @entity4 have been called for a visit to put the bins out			2
