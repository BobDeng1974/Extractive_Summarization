by @entity0 published : 13:18 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 13:19 est , 30 may 2013 @entity2 is bringing back the @entity4 ' start ' button following a massive consumer backlash , it has been revealed			1
the world 's largest software company is hoping to kickstart sales of its latest @entity4 version , which has not made the splash with computer users it was hoping for			1
many complained it was too complicated , and sales of @entity17 and tablets have also eaten significantly into @entity2 's profits as users move away from desktop computers			2
a leaked screenshot of the @entity4 software posted on @entity25 's @entity24 reveals the return of the start button in the bottom left of the screen @entity4 8.1 also includes a vastly improved ' search ' function , which allows a user to search for documents , apps , or items on the internet from a single search bar			1
it also allows users to see all their applications immediately in a grid by swiping down or pressing a button on - screen			0
users can also customize the start screen much more easily , changing sizes of app icon ' tiles ' or controlling which apps appear			0
for the first time , it will be possible to open two windows simultaneously in the new - look interface			0
@entity4 8.1 includes @entity2 's latest browser , @entity54 , and lets the user restore the address bar and tabs to the screen view			1
however , leaked screenshots of a new new version today revealed the button has returned			0
' it â€™s back , baby , ' said @entity64 , who posted the image to his blog			0
' and if you are familiar with how start 8 looks and works , this will look awfully familiar			0
' here , confirmed for the first time , is the @entity72 button			0
' executives say the plan is now to update @entity4 periodically , rather than waiting three years or so between big releases			1
although @entity2 has sold more than 100 million @entity4 8 licenses since october , broadly in line with @entity4 7 three years ago , the company must tackle a dwindling pc user base and its inability to make a mark in the exploding tablet market			2
shipments of traditional pcs - the most reliable gauge of @entity4 ' popularity - are expected to fall almost 8 percent this year , while @entity87 has taken less than 2 percent of the tablet market			1
@entity88 was designed to be used both on touch - screen tablets and traditional @entity91 but while touch - screen users tend to like the new ' tile ' - based interface , many mouse and keyboard users complained that the new design was confusing			2
confirming speculation , @entity2 said the @entity4 update will have a button in the bottom left corner of the screen that acts like the ' start ' button in previous versions of @entity4			1
although it will not be labelled ' start ' , it features the @entity4 logo and takes the user straight to a grid of applications			2
' the work you are seeing us do here is continuing to advance the modern ( interface ) , while really taking into account some of the things we 've learned from people who still want to use the desktop , to make the transition easier , ' @entity110 , corporate vice president of the @entity4 unit , said in an advance briefing on the @entity4 update last week			1
the windows 8 start screen , which many users complained was confusing to use @entity4 8.1 , previously known by the code name ' @entity4 ' , will be available for free to all @entity4 8 users some time later this year			1
@entity2 will make a test version available at its annual developer conference on june 26			0
@entity4 8.1 also includes a vastly improved ' search ' function , which allows a user to search for documents , apps , or items on the internet from a single search bar , like a souped - up version of @entity141 's spotlight feature			1
it also allows users to see all their applications immediately in a grid by swiping down or pressing a button on - screen , which should make it easy for unfamiliar users to get to the app they want quickly			0
users can also customize the start screen much more easily , changing sizes of app icon ' tiles ' or controlling which apps appear			0
for the first time , it will be possible to open two windows simultaneously in the new - look interface			0
@entity4 8.1 includes @entity2 's latest browser , @entity54 , and lets the user restore the address bar and tabs to the screen view			1
that feature was missing in the initial version of @entity88 , which was designed to make the most of limited screen space on a tablet but tended to disorient traditional mouse and keyboard users			2
users will also no longer have to switch to the old desktop view to make changes in their default settings			0
but they will still have to switch back to a traditional desktop set - up to use some programs such as @entity178 or @entity179 , which have not been redesigned to function in the new @entity88 style .			2

@entity4 8.1 set to be made available later this year
update , *codenamed* @entity4 , will be a free *download* for @entity88 owners
