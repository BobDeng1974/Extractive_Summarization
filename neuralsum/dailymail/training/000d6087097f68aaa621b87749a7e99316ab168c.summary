by @entity0 published : 12:04 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 13:54 est , 24 september 2013 just 24 hours earlier , she had rallied the faithful by proclaiming she would be ' more than a dress ' in the battle for @entity5			2
but today @entity6 laid aside the austere black frock she picked for her address to the @entity10 conference and slipped into something a little more feminine for husband @entity13 's keynote speech			1
the outfit , a £ 245 navy jacquard design by @entity16 , exuded grown - up sophistication			1
it was a fitting choice for a high - flying barrister who until recently has been one of @entity21 ’s more reticent political wives			2
@entity6 chose an eye - catching @entity16 dress to watch her husband deliver his keynote speech in @entity26 on tuesday on monday the @entity10 wife claimed that she was more than just a dress as she spoke to @entity10 delegates the high end @entity31 brand is also a favourite of @entity34 and the @entity35 , and the fitted floral dress is part of a slick new wardrobe that @entity6 has deployed for the annual event at a crucial time in her husband 's political career			1
to give her @entity10 speech on monday the mother - of - two chose a classic black flared dress worn with @entity16 heels and statement jewellery			1
she told supporters : ‘ i wanted to come along to say a few words because i thought , “ if i do n't say anything to you guys tonight probably all you 'll know about me this year is the make of the dress i wear for @entity13 's speech on tuesday ”			2
‘ that 's a side of me the media tend to focus on and i thought it was quite important to reassure you that i am in fact more than a dress			2
’ her carefully crafted words on the first day of the conference were just one part of a plan to ' humanise ' husband @entity13 and rescue his plummeting poll ratings			2
previously @entity6 has been one of the more reticent political wags but is stepping up her involvement as @entity13 's poll ratings plummet @entity6 wore a cherry red mac to walk through @entity26 city centre in one of several photo opportunities during the @entity10 conference and chose a simple flared dress to give her ' more than a dress ' speech @entity6 was also snapped in a vivid red mac and smart black trousers on a photo opp tour of the city with husband @entity13 in his ' smart casual ' best on friday			1
although always a stylish dresser , previously the child actress - turned barrister has been one of the more reticent politcal wags , and @entity13 has repeatedly claimed he would not copy @entity88 ’s habit of eye - catching photo opportunities while opposition leader , and would instead focus on policies			1
but party strategists plan to put @entity6 on the political frontline in the run up to the 2015 election and this week the @entity6 and @entity97 has been unleashed on the world			1
the decision to bring mrs @entity6 into the political fray has drawn comparisons with failed attempts by @entity103 and @entity104 to use their other halves to rescue their leadership			0
as @entity6 promises to speak out publicly about why her husband of nine years should be prime minister , the @entity108 children too have been wheeled out in front of the world 's press , swinging arm in arm along @entity26 beach like a mini @entity117 campaign			1
@entity118 , four , and @entity119 , two , have even been labelled as the party 's secret conference weapon			2
party strategists plan to put @entity6 on the political frontline in the run up to the 2015 election and used the party conference to unleashed the @entity6 and @entity97 the couple have been snapped in a series of stage managed photo opportunities designed to humanise the @entity10 leader the couple met in 2004 , but did n't get married until 2011 when @entity6 chose an understated @entity133 dress with no veil			1
as well as revealing her plans to take to the ' barricades ' in support of husband in 2015 the environmental lawyer also revealed the moment she realised she had fallen for him – while rearranging chairs in a hall in @entity144			0
she told delegates : ‘ in may 2005 , @entity13 was the prospective parliamentary candidate for @entity146			0
‘ so i went to @entity144 to help him campaign and i was moving chairs around in a hall getting ready for a campaign meeting and i became aware there were three long - standing party members watching me			0
‘ after a while one of them said to me who was i , so i explained that i was a friend of @entity13 's and i had come from @entity156 to help him campaign			0
labour leader @entity158 and his wife @entity6 take their children @entity118 ( right ) and @entity161 ( left ) for a walk along @entity26 beach on the eve of the @entity10 annual conference lookalike : mr @entity158 's smart casual attire has been compared to the clothes worn by deputy prime minister @entity169 during a recent photo call ‘ there was a pause and then the lady said to me , “ that 's a very long way to come to move chairs , are you sure you 're just friends ? ”			1
‘ she was clearly very astute and realised before we did i think			0
’ the mother - of - two also told @entity10 members she is willing to help them in the run - up to the 2015 general election before joking : ‘ after all you now know i can door - knock , i can move chairs although i guess falling in love at the same time probably gave it a bit of a different dimension			1
nonetheless i am ready and willing			0
’ @entity158 was forced to defend the ' cheesy ' family photographs , which contrast sharply with @entity103 ’s refusal to be photographed with his own young children and the former prime minister ’s accusation that @entity88 used his own family as ‘ props ’ in photographs			0
asked by the @entity196 ’s @entity195 why he had decided to bring them into the public eye ‘ with 500 cameras ’ present , he said : ‘ i love having my family here			0
it ’s a great support and a great thing for me to have them here			0
' @entity158 has defended the pictures of him and his family saying : ¿ i love having my family here			0
it ¿ s a great support and a great thing for me to have them here			0

leader 's wife has vowed to speak out in run - up to 2015 general election
she has given a series of speeches at @entity10 conference in @entity26
