by @entity0 activist : @entity2 , pictured in 1932 , was a prominent suffragette the home of political activist and suffragette @entity2 has been transformed into a block of million - pound flats			1
the women 's rights campaigner , whose mother @entity11 and sister @entity10 were also prominent votes - for - women campaigners , moved to @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 in the 1920s			1
however , she quickly renamed the building @entity19 in honour of her radical , left - wing politics			1
but the now - unrecognisable area has been transformed into a block of 14 luxury apartments , which are expected to sell for between £ 500,000 and £ 1million each			2
miss @entity2 lived in the home with her boyfriend @entity26 , an @entity27 anarchist who was fleeing the rise of fascism in @entity27			1
the pair - who scandalised local society by never marrying - sheltered their political allies during their nine - year stay at the address			0
she was one of the most prominent and politically active members of the @entity38 , nicknamed the suffragettes			0
miss @entity2 arrested at a protest in 1906 and jailed after she refused to pay a fine			1
along with many other women demanding the vote , she was sent to prison and force fed while on hunger strike - but lived to see women included in the voting franchise , which first happened in 1918			1
she was living in @entity19 when @entity49 passed a @entity50 giving all women in the @entity52 the right to vote once they turned 21 , which put them on equal footing with men			1
all that remains from her time there is a sculpture which mr @entity26 made in protest at @entity60 attacking @entity61			0
political movement : miss @entity2 , along with her mother @entity11 and sister @entity10 , was part of the suffragette movement , which famously encouraged members to chain themselves to the railings of @entity70 then : @entity19 , pictured above in the 1920s , a haven for those who shared @entity2 's politics now : newly - constructed @entity75 is made up of 14 two - and three - bedroom flats the new development , @entity75 , is made up of 14 apartments , which has two to three bedrooms each			1
property company @entity80 has restored the sculpture , which now stands outside @entity75 as part of the new development			1
@entity84 , sales director at @entity80 , said : ' @entity2 was an important champion of women ’s rights and civil rights in general			2
' her " @entity19 " home was a haven for political refugees and a place where civil rights were promoted			2
' when her home was demolished in 1939 her famous “ tea shop ” gardens were destroyed and the leafy and tranquil ambience of the site was lost			0
luxurious : the new interiors belie the socialist connections of the development pricey : the flats are expected to sell for between £ 500,000 and £ 1million each grounds : the homes back on to gardens which were once used by @entity106 to sell tea to raise money for the suffragettes ' with the creation of @entity75 we have returned the site to its original roots - having just one property , rather than four - on the land			1
' this has also enabled us to recreate a magnificent single rear garden , which are perfect for people who love gardens but do n’t want the hassle of maintaining it themselves			0
' potential purchasers can visit the dressed show - apartment and landscaped gardens to experience the quality of the development and we hope that some visitors will appreciate the significant history of the site and the civil rights work of @entity2 '			1
@entity19 itself was pulled down in the 1930s , and four separate houses were later built on the land , before being demolished in turn and replaced with @entity75			1
the political campaign to win women the vote began in the late 1800s , and picked up pace around the turn of the century			0
the movement began peacefully , with the @entity142 - also known as the suffragists - formed in 1897 , led by by @entity144			0
the group lobbied @entity49 , and gained some support within the @entity147 but overall met with limited success			0
protest : suffragette @entity149 was killed by the @entity151 's horse after running out in front of it in 1913 the issue became much more pressing in 1903 when @entity156 's suffragettes entered the political landscapes			2
the group was much more hardline , and would heckle politicians , attack the police and make very public protests - such as chaining themselves to the railings outside @entity70			0
one of the most recognisable moments in the group 's campaign came when @entity149 ran out in from of the @entity151 's horse during the @entity166			0
she was trampled by the animal and died			0
the suffragettes suspended their campaigning when the @entity170 broke out in 1914			0
while men were away fighting , women manned the factories at home and , by the time the conflict ended , the public had become much more amenable to granting women votes			2
at first , only certain women - over- 30s , university graduates and property owners - could vote when the franchise was extended in 1918			2
but in 1928 the @entity182 ( @entity183 won them full suffrage .			0
