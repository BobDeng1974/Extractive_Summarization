a powerful committee of @entity1 today demand a ban on fracking in @entity4 ’s @entity3 , ancient woodlands and other protected countryside			1
the @entity7 says there should be a moratorium on drilling for shale in the rest of the @entity4 amid concerns including noise and pollution of water supplies			0
its report is published as ministers face a rebellion from senior @entity20 who have warned they could vote against fracking in the @entity23 today			1
opposing bill : a powerful committee of @entity1 today demand a ban on fracking in @entity4 ’s @entity3 , ancient woodlands and other protected countryside the @entity29 contains measures designed to encourage the controversial energy extraction process , which has slashed energy bills in the @entity33			1
former @entity35 environment secretary @entity34 has called for a ‘ moratorium ’ on drilling , and @entity38 , chairman of the @entity39 , whose @entity41 constituency contains a proposed fracking site , said the technology was ‘ not appropriate ’			2
@entity44 and @entity45 are keen proponents of fracking			2
the prime minister has said the government was ‘ going all out ’ to exploit the technology			0
ministers also say it will create jobs and growth , reduce energy prices and cut the country ’s reliance on gas imports			1
supporters : @entity44 and @entity45 are keen proponents of fracking			2
the prime minister has said the government was ‘ going all out ’ to exploit the technology but critics claim the process carries potentially serious environmental risks , and question whether the benefits for the @entity4 would be as great as those enjoyed by the @entity33			1
ministers ’ enthusiasm for fracking last year was at a time of high energy prices and pressure for action to ease pressure on household power bills			1
this has since eased with the falling oil price and action by energy firms to cut prices			2
in its report , the @entity7 warns of a an ‘ extensive range of uncertainties ’ about the possible hazards resulting from fracking , ranging from polluting groundwater and water supplies to noise and disruption			0
@entity7 chairman , @entity93 mp @entity92 has spoken out about fracking committee chairman , @entity93 mp @entity95 said : ‘ we can not allow @entity4 ’s national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty to be developed into oil and gas fields			0
’ proposed changes to trespass laws to allow fracking without residents ’ permission are , she said , ‘ profoundly undemocratic ’			0
the report says extensive development of shale would not be compatible with the @entity4 ’s goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions			0
it said fracking should be ‘ prohibited outright ’ in protected areas such as national parks , areas of outstanding natural beauty and ancient woodlands , and banned in all water source protection zones – where drinking water is taken from			0
fracking will not be commercially viable unless it is developed on a large scale , but widespread extraction would lead to greater carbon emissions which would breach @entity62 targets			1
some mps on the committee have tabled an amendment to the @entity130 calling for a moratorium on fracking for shale gas to reduce the risk the @entity4 misses its targets to cut carbon emissions			1
the @entity130 includes measures to make it easier for energy companies to drill under people ’s homes without their permission and allows them to leave “ any substance ” deep underground			1
a spokesman for the @entity144 said : ‘ we disagree with the conclusion of this report			0
we have one of the most robust regulatory regimes for shale gas			0
‘ @entity4 shale development is compatible with our goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions and does not detract from our support for renewables ; in fact it could support development of intermittent renewables			0

ministers face rebellion from senior @entity20 likely to vote against fracking
@entity130 backing controversial process to be *discussed* today
@entity62 says it will create jobs , growth and reduce energy prices
but critics claim process carries potentially serious environmental risks
