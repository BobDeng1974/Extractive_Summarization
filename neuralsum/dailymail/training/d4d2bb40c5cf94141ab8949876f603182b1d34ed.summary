in 1967 @entity1 astronomer @entity0 was left stunned by mysterious pulsing signals she detected coming from outside the solar system			1
for months she suggested the signals could be of an extraterrestrial intelligent origin , but they were later proven to be rapidly spinning stars known as pulsars			1
however , a new series of mysterious signals , known as @entity10 ( @entity11 ) , has again got astronomers scratching their heads and wondering if , maybe , we ’re picking up alien messages			1
in 2007 a radio burst was picked up by astronomer @entity17 and his team			2
the origin of the signal could be colliding neutron stars or possibly an alien message			1
this image shows the dispersed signal from the original millisecond radio burst that suggests it must have originated billions of light - years away frbs are radio emissions that appear temporarily and randomly , making them not only hard to find , but also hard to study			0
flaring star some stars are known to suddenly flare up on occasion			2
it ’s possible that this event could send light through the thick ejected layers of a star ’s atmosphere in bursts , but if this were the cause we would expect to find @entity42 towards variable stars ( ones with fluctuating brightness ) in our galaxy , which is not the case			2
white dwarf merger when two white dwarfs merge its possible they can combine into a larger , rapidly spinning white dwarf			0
this event could emit radiation from the poles consistent with @entity42 and , if this is proved correct , it could indicate an association between @entity11 and supernovae			2
neutron star collision ultra-dense stellar known as neutron stars could collide and release huge bursts of radiation before they merge – this event is already thought to be a cause of high - energy bursts known as @entity67 ( grbs ) , and could also be the cause of @entity11			1
@entity70 some neutron stars are regarded as being ‘ supramassive ’ , which means they are so massive they should have already collapsed into a black hole but their rapid rotation keeps them alive			1
when they do suddenly collapse they release an intense burst of radio waves known as a blitzar , and within this emission @entity11 could also be residing			2
the mystery stems from the fact it is not known what could produce such a short and sharp burst , writes @entity85 of @entity86			2
this has led some to speculate they could be anything from stars colliding to artificially created messages			2
the first @entity11 was spotted , or rather ‘ heard ’ by radio telescopes , back in 2007 - but it was so temporary and seemingly random that it took years for astronomers to even agree it was n’t a glitch in one of the telescope 's instruments			1
the signal , which lasted just five milliseconds , was named the @entity101 after its discoverer , @entity17			0
the radio emission was so dispersed , experts suggested it must have come from a great distance away , possibly billions of light - years			0
but early estimates said there should be 10,000 of these events a day – so the fact that another was n’t discovered until 2012 was troubling			0
this was when data from the @entity115 in @entity116 suggested it had heard another @entity11 , along with a handful of others , but the fact that only @entity121 had detected the signals had some claiming these were merely instrument glitches			1
a recent discovery , in april of this year , of an @entity11 using the giant radio dish in @entity125 confirmed to astronomers that these signals are indeed real – but they ’re no closer to finding out an answer as to what they are			1
theories so far include flaring stars , white dwarfs merging , neutron stars colliding and – most intriguingly – alien signals			1
a follow - up observation was made by the @entity115 , time - lapse photo shown , in 2012			0
however it was not until april of this year that the signal was ruled out as an instrument glitch when the @entity141 in @entity125 picked up a similar signal			0
but the mystery of its true origin persists aside from the extraterrestrial origin explanation , another is that it could be caused by the collision of two neutron stars ( artist 's illustration shown )			1
when neutron stars collide a black hole is normally formed , in addition to a magnetic field trillions of times stronger than that of @entity159 , in just two milliseconds ‘ this extraordinary finding either indicates an as yet unknown or unusual astronomical phenomenon , or it could indicate that this is a vast alien communication network , and the universe is teeming with intelligent life forms , ’ says @entity160 , author of the @entity161			1
‘ every unusual signal from outer space encourages us to wonder if it is from an alien civilisation			0
‘ since this signal seems so elusive and hard to interpret then this should be a candidate for further analysis			0
‘ it would be fantastic if this was an alien signal as the knowledge that we are not alone in this vast universe would have a dramatic impact on our perception of our place in the scheme of things			0
' for now , however , @entity42 remain very much a mystery			0
it will take further studies and observations in future to truly determine where they come from , and what is causing them			0
until then , it ’s difficult to rule any particular theory out of the window .			0

*scientists* are trying to work out what is causing @entity10 ( @entity11 )
the strange signals occur for a few milliseconds and come from nowhere
the first was detected in 2007 , but only a handful have been seen since
in april the latest discovery was made , but still the mystery persists
explanations range from colliding neutron stars to alien signals
