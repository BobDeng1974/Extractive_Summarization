this makes any thought of a rescue highly improbable			0
to attempt to rescue one group would only endanger the others			2
' despite the difficulties of a rescue operation , dr @entity10 remains hopeful that the schoolgirls will be freed			1
' every day there is the possibility of the release of the girls , ' he revealed			2
' this is painful for the parents and the nation			0
the well - being of the girls is constantly on our minds and we want to see their release as soon as possible			2
' terror leader @entity84 released a video of the kidnapped girls praying after their conversion to @entity30 the @entity9 leader has declared he would sell the girls into slavery , or marry them off to their kidnappers , if members of his sect were not released from prison however , he warned : ' we must not endanger their lives any further			1

the girls in the video look healthy , but it is understood that fraught negotiations are under way to broker the release several pupils who have fallen ill , including one with a broken wrist			2
@entity122 told @entity124 congress members how @entity9 killed her family in 2011 and called for the release of the kidnapped girls in the video , eight girls , dressed in their home - made school uniforms of pale blue gingham , plead for release as they stand courageously in front of the camera			1
they are clearly scared , upset and trying to be brave			0
each of them walks in turn to a spot in front of a white sheet fixed to a crude frame between the trees			0
four of them can be heard clearly , in their @entity146 language , stating that they were taken by force and that they are hungry			0
a tall girl , aged about 18 , says tearfully : ' my family will be so worried			0
' another , speaking softly , says : ' i never expected to suffer like this in my life			0

' the fourth girl complains : ' we are not getting enough food			0
' the video , taken by an intermediary on may 19 , has been shown to president @entity164			0
it was intended to serve as ' proof of life ' for the girls and to encourage the president to accede to the terrorists ' demands			2
two earlier videos showed the girls seated on the ground , dressed in hijabs , reciting the @entity175 , and @entity9 leader @entity84 declaring he would sell them into slavery , or marry them off to their kidnappers , if members of his sect were not released from prison			1
pressure from the international community and criticism of the president 's slow response to the kidnapping have led to a series of contradictory pronouncements from his government			0
@entity191 holds up a photograph of her daughter @entity193 who is one of the girls kidnapped by @entity9 ministers have declared they will not negotiate with @entity9 , or consider the release of prisoners , while official spokesmen have said ‘ the window is always open for dialogue ’			1
at a @entity204 peace summit , several @entity14 countries neighbouring @entity4 vowed to join in ‘ outright war ’ against the terrorists			2
@entity33 , @entity207 and @entity124 pledged their support and have sent teams of military experts and advisers to the region			0
intelligence sources have told the @entity215 of several rescue attempts , one involving the release of suspected low - level @entity9 members detained without charges or trial			1
two attempts were aborted at the last minute when the terrorists took fright while delivering a group of girls to a safe location			2
last week @entity4 ’s chief of defence @entity227 said the government knew the location of the girls and claimed that police and military had been ‘ following them ’ since the abduction			1
he refused to divulge details , saying it would put the girls in further danger			0
sources said mr @entity227 ’s announcement may have been the result of government officials seeing the new , unpublished video			0
they may have been able to persuade @entity9 ’s intermediary to provide details of the location			2
it is believed the hostages have been split into at least four groups			0
the @entity4 government has been engaged in negotiations with @entity9 's spiritual leader @entity84 in a bid to secure the girls ' release ' the vast majority of the @entity21 girls are not being held in @entity4 , ’ dr @entity10 said			1
' they are in camps across the @entity4 border in @entity263 , @entity264 and @entity41			2
i say the “ vast majority ” as i know a small group was confirmed to me to be in @entity4 last week when we sought to have them released			1
' he described how fraught the negotiation process has been			0
‘ one of that small group of girls is ill and we had hoped we might convince the commander of the group holding her that she should be released so we could give her medical treatment , ’ dr @entity10 said			1
‘ there are other girls who are not well and we have come close to having them released but their captors fear a trap in which they will be captured in the handover process			2
‘ ' one girl has what i assume is a broken wrist as they demonstrate to me how she holds her hand			0
i have been told that others are sick and in need of medical attention			0
’ the heavily armed terror group have moved the girls to a ' safe location ' a military source said : ‘ this has been a race against time from the minute they were captured			1
as soon as the girls left @entity4 soil it was always going to be more difficult			1
' the government made no attempt at a rescue until a month after they were taken			0
now the situation gets more serious by the day			0
‘ any sort of attempt to get to them would have to be cleared by the governments of the other nations			0
’ scathing condemnations of @entity4 ’s failure to address the menace of @entity9 , ever since a proposed peace deal failed last august – leading to the extension of a state of emergency in three northern states – continued worldwide last week			1
@entity124 senator @entity317 , chairman of the @entity318 , said @entity4 had been ‘ tragically and unacceptably slow ’ to begin a search			2
others say the clock really being watched by @entity4 politicians is not the six weeks and counting since the kidnap but the 11 months to the country ’s elections			1
opposition politician @entity326 has accused the government of ‘ total failure ’ .			0

dr @entity10 , from @entity12 , is in talks with terror group @entity9
the group wants to impose @entity25 law across @entity4
