@entity0 has defended @entity2 's transfer policy and insisted @entity3 will not be sold in january			1
goal - shy @entity2 have bagged just 11 goals in 22 games and have failed to score in their last five @entity7 games			1
they only have three senior strikers in @entity3 , @entity9 and @entity10 - who have netted just eight league goals between them this season			1
@entity3 , who has struggled to find the net , will not be sold by @entity2 during this window @entity2 boss @entity0 insists there is ' no chance ' of @entity3 leaving the club in this current window fellow striker @entity19 has been out for a year since breaking his leg and @entity2 failed to bring in any cover in the summer			1
but manager @entity0 , who sent @entity22 on loan to @entity24 this month , insisted he knew the situation and is happy with his options			1
he said : ' even if you go for a top , top striker in football now you are talking , £ 10million to £ 15million - plus			2
@entity31 has been my biggest signing and he was millions of euros			2
now he is probably , on his game , one of the best strikers in @entity37			2
' i knew the situation at the club , i knew we were n't going to do these sort of things			2
i had to respect @entity44 's ( @entity45 , chairman ) way and there is no problem - that is the way the club is			0
' @entity3 ( right ) takes a shot against @entity50 but @entity52 goalkeeper @entity51 is equal to it the striker holds his head after missing a chance - @entity2 have scored 11 goals in 22 @entity7 games and @entity0 insisted the club will not entertain any bids for @entity3 this transfer window			1
listen , there is no way and i am pretty sure @entity44 will be totally fine , ' he said			0
@entity19 , a £ 7million signing from @entity66 in 2013 , could return before the end of the season but @entity0 is cautious after the 25 - year - old 's lengthy lay - off			1
' @entity71 has been an absolute disaster with his leg break , he 's been a nightmare			0
he is doing really well actually , he is coming back at the beginning for next week , ' he said			0
' his rehab has gone really well and he 's still got a wee bit of the way to go but he is getting there			0
we need to sit and discuss moving on to ball work but for the horrific break it was , he is doing well			0
' a lot will depend on his healing , how he is			0
we have to wait and be guided by him and the medical people on how he is doing			0
' @entity3 falls backwards as he positions himself to take a right - footed shot against @entity50			1
