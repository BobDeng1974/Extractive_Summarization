a young family are living in constant fear and could be driven from their home - because of an invasion of monster venomous spiders which attack humans instead of running away			1
@entity8 , 24 , has already been bitten by one of the ultra-aggressive hobo spiders - and has been left with a deep , infected wound that could take three months to heal			1
his partner , 27 - year - old @entity12 , has trapped and killed around 30 of the beasts , and the couple are frightened that one of their three young children will be their next victim			1
despite ms @entity12 's efforts , more and more of the monsters - which have five - inch long hairy legs - keep appearing in their home			1
the full - time mother , who has a six - year - old son and two - year - old daughter , said : ' they 're like normal spiders on steroids - i hate them			2
fearsome : the spiders have five - inch long hairy legs and their venom causes the skin around the bite to die aggro arachnids : instead of running away like most spiders , these beasts rear up and attack humans ' we opened the attic door and a few of them came out so now we are scared to go up there again			1
' they are horrible , vile things			0
i found one in the bath last week , and when i put a pint glass over it , it 's long legs just filled up the whole glass			0
' they do n't seem to be scared to run at us either , they run towards us and seem very aggressive			0
' when you corner them they rear up their legs			2
their bodies are pretty much normal size but it 's the legs - the front legs are the size of your hand			0
' ms @entity12 , whose partner also has a three - year - old son , added : ' if we ca n't get rid of them i just want to move because we 've got three children and i do n't want them to be bitten			1
' @entity90 victim : mr @entity8 was bitten and doctors have told him that it may take three months to heal the spider venom causes the skin around the bite to die - a process known as necrosis which can need surgical treatment - while victims have also reported severe headaches , nausea , vision problems and memory loss			1
' the bite on my partner 's arm is awful			2
he did n't feel it at first but the venom started to spread and it has left a crater where the skin has died , ' ms @entity12 said			1
' we are all on edge at the moment , it 's terrible			0
' this is the first year we 've ever seen them as big as this , and had so many			0
' hobo spiders - or @entity120 - look like common house spiders , but are bigger , with thick , hairy legs			1
national invasion : the warmer weather means this year has been a bumper one for spiders , and with temperatures set to drop in the coming weeks , they could be coming to homes across the country they are native to @entity132 but rarely come into contact with humans			1
they make funnel - shaped webs of silk sheeting and lie in wait at the small end for their prey			0
while most spiders scuttle away when approached by humans , these run towards people and have a potent bite			2
experts have warned that it could be a bumper year for spiders because of the warm weather , and with the temperature set to fall in the coming weeks , the bigger - than - ever arachnids could be invading homes all over the country			1
spider expert @entity154 , of @entity155 , said there was an increase in bigger spiders this year but urged the public to remain calm			0
he said : ' the hobo spider is a relative of the common house spider			2
' most bites become nasty because they are not cared for properly and get infected , not because of spider venom			0
' if a bite is festering , the wound is going off and you need to seek medical attention			0
' he added : ' there are a lot of large spiders around this year			0
' i have had four or five in my own house in the last few weeks , and we 've had a bit of a spider frenzy this week			0
' if you 're in an area where spiders are moving through , you will see a lot around the house			2
