the head of the @entity1 provoked scorn last night by claiming the euro was out of the danger zone			1
despite the economic slump across the region , @entity5 said the single currency was no longer at risk of collapse			1
‘ i think we can say that the existential threat against the euro has essentially been overcome , ’ he told a conference in his native @entity12			1
‘ in 2013 , the question wo n’t be if the euro will or will not implode			1
’ things are looking up : @entity5 at the @entity12 diplomatic meeting where he announced that the threat against the survival of the eurozone was over however , @entity23 , a currency expert at @entity25 , said mr @entity5 was ‘ simply not in a position to make such predictions ’			1
he added : ‘ 2013 will be a tougher year than 2012 for @entity28 and by extension , the euro area as a whole			1
the crisis is most certainly not over			1
’ @entity33 , an analyst at @entity35 spread - betting firm @entity34 , said : ‘ with the level of austerity that must be implemented , there can be no growth in @entity41 countries or , for that matter , @entity43 for years to come			1
‘ the day of reckoning will come and many of these economies will be staring in to the economic and financial abyss			1
the crisis is far from over			2
’ and @entity50 , a leading financial analyst , said : ‘ of course mr @entity5 is going to talk up the survival of the euro as he is the @entity1 president			1
‘ in every financial crises going back to the beginning of time , politicians lie to us			2
civil unrest : an @entity60 protester holds a stone during clashes with riot police at a students ' demonstration against austerity measures in downtown @entity67 last november ‘ it is their job to pretend that the situation is better than it is in order that they do not make the situation worse by talking it down			1
‘ but that does not mean that we need to believe what they say			2
’ the eurozone has enjoyed a period of relative calm since @entity82 , the head of the @entity83 , pledged to do whatever it took to save the currency – and in particular stand behind the debts of cash - strapped governments such as @entity91			2
it has boosted confidence in the euro and few analysts are now predicting a break - up of the single currency this year			1
rise of extremism : members of the @entity101 extreme - right ultra nationalist party @entity100 ( @entity100 ) light flares in a street protest in @entity104 last summer but it is feared the region is in for further hardship as unemployment soars and recessions deepen – stoking public anger amid mounting opposition to the flawed currency union			2
the crisis will play a central role in crucial elections in @entity28 and @entity60 – the biggest and third biggest economies in the eurozone			2
in her @entity120 message , @entity28 chancellor @entity118 last week warned that 2013 will be a tough year for @entity28 and the eurozone			1
even though the consensus has swung towards the euro staying intact , economists still fret about the wider long - term effects of austerity			1
a possible explanation for @entity129 's relative social peace to date is that the burden of adjustment has fallen mainly on the young			1
in @entity91 , for example , the number of under - 25s in work fell from 39.1 per cent in 2007 to 18.3 per cent in 2012 , a fall of 20.8 percentage points			2
for the 35 - 49 age group , who are better protected against layoffs , the drop over was 8.9 percentage points			2
this mix of ' youth sacrifice ' and relative economic security for the bulk of the population might be why street protests have failed - except in @entity101 - to translate into a big shift in votes for radical parties , according to @entity153 , a @entity154 economist			2
but the potential economic cost is huge			0
with fewer youngsters working , @entity60 and @entity91 have suffered a loss in productivity of about 2 per cent , mr @entity153 estimated			0
the textbook answer is to push policies to end the divide between hard - to - fire ' insiders ' and typically young ' outsiders ' on precarious short - term contracts			0
but the risk is that such structural reforms become discredited because voters associate them with declining living standards and rising inequality , said @entity171 , chief economist at the @entity172 in @entity173			0
' the consequences are likely to be far - reaching			0
not only will governments struggle to push through the needed reforms , but there is a risk of a broader backlash against the market economy and the @entity182 , ' he said			0
‘ the crisis is far from over , ’ she said			0
‘ the economic environment will not in fact be easier but rather more difficult next year			0
’ the latest forecasts from the @entity188 , a leading global financial watchdog , suggest the @entity28 economy will grow by a paltry 0.6 per cent this year			1
the @entity43 economy is set to grow by just 0.3 per cent , according to the @entity188 , while a further year of recession is expected in @entity60 and @entity91			0
unemployment is over 25 per cent in @entity91 and @entity101 and more than half of all youngsters there who want to work can not find a job			0
@entity43 unemployment has soared to its highest level since the country adopted the euro – piling pressure on socialist president @entity203			1
@entity204 , the highly - respected financial magazine , recently warned that @entity43 is ‘ the time - bomb at the heart of @entity129 ’ – sparking fury in @entity208			0
the eurozone crisis has been brewing since late 2009 before exploding to life in 2010			0
so far it has led to a change of government among eight of the 17 single currency zone member states			0
asked about mr @entity5 ’s latest comments yesterday , @entity217 leader @entity216 said mr @entity82 ’s pledge to prop up the euro ‘ had temporarily diverted the markets ’ attention ’ but added that ‘ fundamentally nothing has changed ’			1
he said : ‘ there are still massive economic flaws which will take more than words to cure			0
’ @entity226 , a director at financial experts @entity227 , said mr @entity5 was ‘ not right and it ’s not over ’			0
he said : ‘ it ’s been pronounced over many times over the last few years , incorrectly , and this is just the latest such pronouncement			0
‘ it ’s not dead , though it ’s been lulled to sleep by the soothing melodies issuing from the @entity83 and elsewhere			0
‘ but there is always a risk it will wake up again – some shock like a bank failure , or another @entity101 default , or a surprise result in the @entity60 or @entity28 elections , or something like that			0
