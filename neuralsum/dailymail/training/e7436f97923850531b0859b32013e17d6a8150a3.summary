a picture claiming to show the front panels of @entity3 's upcoming @entity2 has leaked online			2
it reveals a much - rumoured larger 4.7inch screen			1
@entity3 is also believed to be developing a 5.5inch screen version , with both expected to be unveiled in september and go on sale soon after			1
it similarly revealed what appeared to be the much - rumoured 4.7 - inch screen , but reports also claim @entity3 is working on a 5.5 - inch version and the rear casing may be either @entity3 's @entity2 is rumoured to come in a slim ' @entity22 ' version			1
up until august last year , @entity23 was the record - holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its @entity27 , at 6.18mm			2
this was then replaced by the @entity29 at just 5.75mm			0
by comparison , @entity3 ’s current @entity30 has a depth of 7.6mm , while the @entity33 is slightly thinner at 7.5mm			0
@entity35 's @entity34 is 7.9mm thick , while the @entity36 is 9.3mm			0
according to iphone.fr , which first spotted the images , the dimensions of the screen lend credibility to the image			2
' this snapshot was spotted on @entity12 this morning , ' the site says			0
' it features what may be ( or not ) an " @entity47 " front face			2
' by comparison with the @entity51 ( left ) , we can estimate year height for the screen of 4.1 inches ( 10.7 cm ) and a width around 2.35 inches ( 6 cm )			1
' this gives a ratio of width and height 0.55 , which is exactly the one found on the current @entity51 and a 4.7 " diagonal length ! ' having exactly the same screen dimensions would ensure app developers do not have to create separate versions of their software for the new sizes			1
the rumours come amid claims @entity3 suppliers around the world are about to crank up their production lines for the big screen set to find its way into the @entity51 6			1
@entity72 , @entity73 and @entity75 's @entity74 have all been tapped to make the screens			0
they will begin mass producing displays as within weeks for the next @entity51 , expected to be launched this autumn , with a 4.7 - inch screen likely to be produced first while a 5.5 - inch version could be delayed			1
representatives for the three suppliers and for @entity3 declined to comment			0
both @entity51 6 screens will be larger than the 4.0 - inch panels on @entity3 's existing @entity30 and 5c models			1
recent concept images by designer @entity88 , pictured , and @entity90 artists @entity91 and @entity92 feature a curved screen with ' bumps ' at the top and bottom , along with an illuminated @entity98 sensor used to recognise fingerprints , first introduced on the @entity30 larger iphones , the subject of months of speculation , would mark yet another incremental tweak to the popular smartphone line and an attempt to catch up to rivals like @entity35 ceo @entity108 , while promising only ' new product categories ' for 2014 , has played his cards close to his chest			1
@entity3 's shares have languished below $ 600 since november 2012 , in part because of worries about smartphone market saturation and its ability to stay at the forefront of tech innovation			0
both @entity51 6 screens are expected to use in - cell touch panel technology - built into the screen and allowing for thinner construction than with standard touch panel films - that was introduced with the @entity51 , the sources said			1
the images , pictured left and right , were posted on @entity14 social network @entity12 earlier this week and are thought to have been leaked by an anonymous insider working at @entity3 supplier @entity127			0
although the images are blurry , they appear to show a rounded design and protruding camera , similar to that seen on the @entity133 but due to difficulties with in - cell production technology for the larger 5.5 - inch size , one of the sources said , a decision was made to begin mass production with the 4.7 - inch version alone			1
production of 5.5 - inch screens is expected to start several months later , with the possibility of a shift to a film sensor instead of in - cell technology for that size , the source said			1
@entity72 will be the first supplier to start production , at its flagship plant at @entity151 , east of @entity152 , as early as may , the sources said			2
the others are due to begin output around june			0

although the images are blurry , they appear to show a rounded design and a protruding camera , similar to those seen on the @entity133			0
alternatively , the models shown in the pictures could be the next generation of @entity3 's mp3 player			0
reports are claiming @entity3 is gearing up to go into mass production of the screen on its next flagship phone as early as next month			1
the first image shows what appears to be a blueprint of the @entity47 , while the other two images of prototype models are shown in silver with rounded edges - similar to those seen on last year ’s @entity33 tablet			2
speculation is rife that @entity3 could follow up this super-thin tablet with an equally slim phone , dubbed @entity22 , and the new images appear to corroborate this			0
earlier this month , @entity185 magazine @entity184 published drawings of what purported to be a 4.7 - inch and 5.7 - inch @entity188			1
earlier this month , @entity185 magazine @entity184 published drawings of what seemed to be a 4.7 - inch and 5.7 - inch @entity188 , pictured			1
the drawings feature a flat , bezel - free device with rectangle - shaped volume controls like those found on the current @entity196 , as well as a camera with a single led - flash on the rear the drawings feature a flat , bezel - free device with rectangle - shaped volume controls like those found on the current @entity196 , as well as a camera with a single led - flash on the rear			0
recent concept images were then created using the schematics detailed in @entity210 ’s release , by designer @entity88 , and @entity90 artists @entity91 and @entity212			0
these concepts feature a curved screen with ' bumps ' at the top and bottom , along with an illuminated @entity98 sensor used to recognise fingerprints , first introduced on the @entity30			2
the protruding camera and rounded edges of the purported @entity47 prototypes are similar to those seen on the current @entity133 model , pictured the latest mockups come after @entity227 sources said the camera in the @entity47 will get a boost to @entity230 , from its current @entity232 version , along with a new lens offering better picture quality			0
it is also expected to boast a new filter , allowing for clearer pictures			2
if @entity3 follows its usual release schedule , the new models will be unveiled in september this year , although experts are expecting the tech giant to launch at least one model in june			2
@entity3 's new devices are expected to use the in - cell touch panel technology - which embeds sensors more tightly into the screen - seen on previous models to make the next device as thin as possible			1
but reports suggest difficulties with this technology in larger displays has caused @entity3 to delay production of the 5.5 - inch versions			1
it has been widely accepted @entity3 's rumoured 4.7 - inch @entity51 6 ( concept pictured left ) will debut in september , with the 5.5 - inch model launching in 2015			1
this was blamed on manufacturing problems			0
the latest reports , instead , are blaming this staggered release date on @entity3 's marketing strategy			0
