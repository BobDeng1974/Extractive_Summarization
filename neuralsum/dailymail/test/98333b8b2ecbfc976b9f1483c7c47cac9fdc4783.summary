the scene looks as though there has been a disaster			2
in what was likened to a ‘ military operation ’ a pair of cranes struggle to retrieve a ‘ casualty ’ from a house , while fire engines , police , a medical team and other officials stand by			1
the immediate area is screened from the public gaze with tarpaulin			2
no traffic can get to nearby schools			2
for seven hours , there is a state of ‘ mayhem ’			1
yet it was no sudden catastrophic incident , as some witnesses imagined			2
this was simply what it took to remove a 22 - year - old woman who weighs 55st from her home			1
she is 5ft 6in tall but exists on a 13,000 - calorie - a - day binge of takeaways and junk food which has rendered her immobile			1
the source of her income to finance her intake is unclear			2
‘ @entity46 ’s fattest woman ’ , as she has been described , eats to excess because she wants to and has done so since the age of five			1
periodically , her bloated body can take it no more and she has to be removed to hospital for treatment			1
that is what happened in the village of @entity64 , on the edge of @entity34 , on wednesday			1
it is the second time in three years the emergency services have been summoned to free her from her self - inflicted prison			1
on the first occasion they had to demolish part of her parents ’ house			1
since then she has been given a specially adapted ground - floor flat with @entity79 doors opening onto the street			1
this was to allow easier access for the next inevitable medical emergency			2
and so it came to pass			2
largely bedridden for the past fortnight because of water retention , @entity86 developed a ‘ severe infection ’ which required hospital treatment			1
but she had become too big and weak to move			2
calling the ambulance meant a major logistical operation which must have cost thousands of pounds in manpower and equipment hire he first crane proved not strong enough to lift the patient			1
a larger crane had to be summoned which necessitated closing half - a - mile of the main road for an hour for other individuals , this would at worst have been a question of calling an ambulance			1
in @entity86 ’s extraordinary case it meant a major logistical operation which must have cost thousands of pounds in manpower and equipment hire			1
her extraction began a little after 9am			0
three nurses from the local hospital and a paramedic arrived outside @entity86 ’s block of flats in a convoy of cars			1
they were to prepare her for the move			0
soon afterwards , the medical team was joined by a fire officer , whose job it was to assess the dimensions and route of the removal			1
he decided the special @entity79 doors would have to be entirely removed			0
the first police officers and an ambulance arrived at 10am , according to neighbours			1
at 11.30am , two fire tenders pulled up followed by a mobile crane , an essential piece of equipment when lifting a 55st woman on a reinforced stretcher			1
at midday , three police cars arrived			0
they would be joined in the afternoon by another four			0
one resident reported : ‘ it ’s absolute chaos , there ’s 999 vehicles everywhere and dozens of emergency service workers			0
all the roads are shut			0
’ and still the operation had not begun			1
at 2.30pm , the critical care medical team arrived in an suv			0
by the time the first attempt to remove @entity86 began an hour later , there were more than a dozen emergency vehicles outside the flats and in the car park at the back			1
soon , a serious problem became apparent			0
the first crane proved not strong enough to lift the patient			1
a larger crane had to be summoned which necessitated closing half - a - mile of the main road for an hour			1
by the time it arrived , eyewitnesses estimated the number of specialists in attendance to be as many as 40			0
you may wonder why and what else was happening elsewhere in @entity35 that might have more usefully held their attention			0
one neighbour said : ‘ i thought the flats were on fire , there were so many vehicles			1
the road was totally blocked , it was absolute mayhem			1
’ largely bedridden for the past fortnight because of water retention , @entity86 ( pictured left and right ) developed a ‘ severe infection ’ which required hospital treatment			1
but she had become too big and weak to move @entity86 blamed her initial bingeing on ‘ comfort eating ’ following the death of her father from emphysema when she was little @entity86 was finally removed seven hours after the procedure began			1
she was taken in a reinforced ambulance to @entity198 hospital , where she is expected to remain for weeks			1
it was claimed that she had recently begun eating salads in order to lose weight			0
but as one neighbour , @entity203 , reportedly pointed out : ‘ @entity86 may be having salads , but she is having takeaways too			0
i ’ve seen them being delivered			0
what ’s the good of having salad for lunch if you have an 18in pizza for tea ? ’ another was reported to have said : ‘ i ca n’t eat as much in a week as she eats in a day			1
’ a spokesman for @entity218 said : ‘ we can confirm that the fire service was brought in to assist us with access to a property in order to safely transport a patient into hospital			1
’ @entity226 , @entity227 all refused to comment on the cost of the operation			1
social landlord @entity231 homes , which owns @entity86 ’s flat , also refused to comment			0
her mother @entity233 , who has weighed as much as 31st , must also take a good deal of the blame			0
she had fed baby @entity86 condensed milk and potatoes instead of baby food a spokesman for the @entity242 said : ‘ we attended a joint operation with colleagues from @entity218 , @entity227 , the @entity246 and @entity247 , and @entity226 to assist in the transportation of a patient to hospital			1
‘ this involved nine personnel from @entity242 and two from @entity253			0
the operation started with preparation on site at 9.15am and our staff left the scene at 4pm			1
’ @entity86 first came to national attention in 2008 when , aged 15 , she had a 64in waist and weighed 33st			2
she also had type 2 diabetes			0
she said : ‘ i know it ’s partly my fault			0
but it ’s so hard to stop eating			0
it ’s like a drug			0
some people choose heroin but i ’ve chosen food and it ’s killing me			0
it ’s as if i can hear @entity271 [ the bakers ] calling me			0
’ she blamed her initial bingeing on ‘ comfort eating ’ following the death of her father from emphysema when she was little			2
at seven she weighed 11st			0
as a teenager her daily intake included multi-packs of crisps , litre bottles of fizzy drinks , chips and sausages			0
she was banned from her school canteen for over-eating			0
she had stopped attending @entity289 lessons long before			0
at home , she watched television , surfed the internet and , of course , ate			2
her mother @entity233 , who has weighed as much as 31st , must also take a good deal of the blame			0
she had fed baby @entity86 condensed milk and potatoes instead of baby food			0
@entity86 was sent to a ‘ fat camp ’ in the @entity302 after doctors warned she would die if she did n’t lose 20st			2
in nine months there she lost 14st 6lb as she took regular exercise and existed on 1,500 calories a day			0
but she was welcomed home with fish and chips and within 20 months was back up to 40st			2
crisis point was reached in 2012 , by which time the 19 - year - old was eating seven kebabs in one sitting and had reached a weight of 63st			2
it is the second time in three years the emergency services have been summoned to free her from her self - inflicted prison			1
she also had to be rescued from her home in 2012 in a similar operation during that incident , a 40 - strong team of emergency service personnel and engineers laboured for eight hours to remove her from her bedroom at the housing association home she shared with her mother and stepfather a 40 - strong team of emergency service personnel and engineers laboured for eight hours to remove her from her bedroom at the housing association home she shared with her mother and stepfather			1
@entity86 had collapsed with breathing problems and chest pains			0
the rescuers had to demolish the top half of the semi and build a scaffold in order to support a ramp to the pavement			0
roof supports had to be inserted and she was lifted onto a special stretcher using a crane			1
again a reinforced ambulance took her to hospital			1
the operation , including repairs , was costed at £ 100,000			2
such scenes will be repeated if more is not done to tackle obesity , say campaigners			0
one in three children in the @entity46 is overweight , while one in five is obese			0
teenage girls form the majority of the one million or so obese under - 18s			2
@entity360 spokesman @entity359 said : ‘ it is a military operation			2
it will be an equivalent cost , which the @entity363 has to pay			0
‘ there will be many more @entity365 who we do n’t know about because they are stuck in their houses and can not get out without being winched out			0
‘ the @entity363 has to introduce screening for children and adults and if we do n’t do that we are going to find more of this in the future			0
’ additional reporting by @entity376			2

@entity378 , 22 , was lifted from her home in 7 - hour operation
first crane was not strong enough to lift her so a larger crane had to be summoned which forced closure of road in @entity34 , south @entity388
@entity390 thought the ' mayhem ' was *due* to her flats being on fire
