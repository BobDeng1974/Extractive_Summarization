@entity1 is planning for a robotic spaceship to lasso a small asteroid and park it near the moon for astronauts to explore , a top senator revealed friday			1
the robotic ship would capture the 500 - ton 25 - foot asteroid in 2019			1
then using an @entity9 space capsule , now being developed , a crew of about four astronauts would nuzzle up next to the rock in 2021 for spacewalking exploration , according to a government document obtained by @entity15			1
sen. @entity16 , @entity17 , said the plan would speed up by four years the existing mission to land astronauts on an asteroid by bringing the space rock closer to @entity23			1
exploration : using an @entity9 space capsule , pictured , a crew of about four astronauts would nuzzle up next to the rock in 2021 for spacewalking exploration @entity16 , who is chairman of the @entity32 science and space subcommittee , said on friday that president @entity33 is putting $ 100 million in planning money for the accelerated asteroid mission in the 2014 budget that comes out next week			1
the @entity38 senator is also a former astronaut , he spent six days orbiting the earth in 1986 aboard the shuttle @entity40			0
the money would be used to find the right small asteroid			1
' it really is a clever concept , ' @entity16 said in a press conference in @entity46			0
' go find your ideal candidate for an asteroid			1
go get it robotically and bring it back			0
' while there are thousands of asteroids that size out there , finding the right one that comes by @entity23 at just the right time to be captured will not be easy , said @entity58 , who heads @entity1 's @entity59 that monitors close - by asteroids			1
he said once a suitable rock is found it would be captured with the space equivalent of ' a baggie with a drawstring			0
you attach the solar propulsion module to de-spin it and bring it back to where you want it			0
' how to catch an asteroid : this graphic shows how the projected asteroid - catching spacecraft might look			2
the 18 - ton probe would catch a 500 - ton space rock in a giant , draw - string bag @entity58 said a 25 - foot asteroid is no threat to @entity23 because it would burn up should it inadvertently enter @entity23 's atmosphere			1
the mission as @entity16 described is perfectly safe , he said			2
@entity16 said this would help @entity1 develop the capability to nudge away a dangerous asteroid if one headed to @entity23 in the future			1
it also would be training for a future mission to send astronauts to @entity89 in the 2030s , he said			1
the government document said the mission , with no price tag at the moment , would inspire because it ' will send humans farther than they have ever been before			1
' the mission was first suggested last year by space experts at the @entity98			2
projected to cost $ 2.65billion in total and last ten years , the project has found favor with the @entity33 administration , which has already announced a goal of sending astronauts to a near - @entity23 asteroid by 2025			1
researchers from @entity98 's @entity107 ( @entity107 ) detailed the plan in a paper published last spring			0
' the idea of exploiting the natural resources of asteroids dates back over a hundred years , but only now has the technology become available to make this idea a reality , ' the report says			0
the @entity107 feasibility study suggests that bringing a 500 - ton asteroid closer to @entity23 would give astronaut crews a ' unique , meaningful and affordable ' destination for the next decade			1
schematic : researchers from @entity98 's @entity107 ( @entity107 ) detailed the plan in a paper published last spring , but @entity1 is now reportedly seeking funding to execute it it adds : ' placing an @entity59 [ near @entity126 ] in lunar orbit would provide a new capability for human exploration not seen since @entity130			1
such an achievement has the potential to inspire a nation			0
' it would be mankind ’s first attempt at modifying the heavens to enable the permanent settlement of humans in space			0
' the report outlines an entirely robotic mission to locate and capture a @entity59 ( @entity59 ) , with a diameter of about seven meters and a mass of around 500,000kg			2
it is hoped such a modestly sized space rock may contain up to 100 tons of water , 100 tons of carbon rich compounds , 90 tons of metals and 200 tons of silicates			2
an 18 - ton probe would be launched on an @entity153 rocket and use the @entity155 's gravity to slingshot itself towards its target in interplanetary space			0
once there , the spacecraft would deploy a massive inflatable bag to envelop the asteroid - maneuvering to stabilize against any tumble or rotation - then ' multiple " draw strings " would cinch - close the opening of the bag and also cinch - tight against the bulk material , ' the report says			2
the proposed timeline for capturing the asteroid : projected to cost $ 2.65 billion in total and last ten years , the project is said to have found favor with the @entity33 administration it adds : ' due to the residual velocity between the asteroid and the spacecraft , there would be some “ impact ” as the asteroid is captured			1
' although , since the asteroid would be much more massive than the spacecraft , it is perhaps better to think of this as the asteroid capturing the spacecraft			2
an ion thruster is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft that creates thrust by accelerating ions			0
ion thrusters use beams of ions ( electrically charged atoms or molecules ) to create thrust in accordance with momentum conservation			0
they create very small levels of thrust compared to conventional chemical rockets but achieve very high specific impulse , or propellant mass efficiencies , by accelerating their exhausts to very high speed			0
however , ion thrusters carry a fundamental price : the power imparted to the exhaust increases with the square of its velocity while the thrust increases only linearly			0
normal chemical rockets , on the other hand , can provide very high thrust but are limited in total impulse by the small amount of energy that can be stored chemically in the propellants			2
due to their relatively high power needs and the requirement of an environment void of other ionized particles ion thrust propulsion is currently only practical in space			0
' nevertheless , once the spacecraft and asteroid are tightly secured together , the spacecraft could then de-tumble the combination			2
' moving such a huge object using conventional rockets would need an enormous amount of fuel to be carried along with the probe			0
so rather than using chemical rockets it would be equipped with a solar powered electric propulsion system			0
such ' ion thrusters ' , as they are known , work by using electricity generated by solar panels to accelerate charged particles away from the space craft , ars technica explains			0
using these , the spacecraft could begin its long track back to the @entity155 , estimated to take between two and six years			0
the announcement of the $ 100 million in funding for the project comes three months after major - general @entity255 made a cryptic suggestion to a @entity258 committee on human space flight			1
' when the president announced that an asteroid would be the next destination for @entity1 's human spaceflight program , he did not say @entity1 had to fly all the way to an asteroid , ' he said			1
' what matters is the ability to put humans on an asteroid			2

would help @entity1 develop the capability to nudge away a dangerous asteroid if one headed to @entity23
asteroid exploration could be training for a future mission to send astronauts to @entity89 in the 2030s
president @entity33 is putting $ 100 million in planning money in the 2014 budget that comes out next week .
in total , project could cost $ 2.65 billion
