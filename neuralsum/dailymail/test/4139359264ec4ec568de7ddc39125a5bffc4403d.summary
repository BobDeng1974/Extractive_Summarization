@entity1 's hopes of a fairytale ending to his @entity4 career were shattered as his side suffered a 2 - 1 defeat to @entity7 in the semi-finals of the @entity9			1
the final on may 30 , also by coincidence @entity1 's 35th birthday , would have been the midfielder 's final game in a @entity4 shirt before he leaves for the @entity16 in the summer , but - although he was handed a starting role by manager @entity18 - he was unable to influence the outcome			2
here , @entity20 takes a closer look at @entity1 's performance at @entity23			2
@entity4 midfielder @entity1 ( left ) competes for posession with @entity25 role @entity1 started the game in an advanced role behind @entity29 and to the right of @entity31 in a 3 - 4 - 2 - 1 formation but midway through the first half , @entity4 adjusted their shape to 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 , pushing @entity31 wide left and allowing @entity1 to adopt a more central position behind the striker			1
@entity18 tweaked @entity4 , and @entity1 's , shape for a third time at the interval , as the @entity40 went 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 with @entity1 playing deepest of the midfield three			2
@entity1 controls possession under pressure from @entity7 's @entity44 at @entity23 @entity1 almost snatched a dramatic equaliser with four minutes left , but his header was cleared off the line possession the first half largely passed @entity1 by as playing further forward starved him of any sustained spells of possession and @entity7 crowded out the space in front of their back four to good effect			1
dropping back into central midfield after the interval allowed the @entity4 captain to collect the ball from his defenders but his passing was cautious and occasionally wayward			0
@entity1 was deployed in a number of different roles by @entity18 ( right ) throughout the contest goal threat @entity1 blazed a long - range effort over the bar shortly after half - time and curled a potentially dangerous free - kick into the hands of @entity69 midway through the second half			0
he almost snatched a dramatic equaliser with four minutes left , but his header was cleared off the line			0
overall this was far from the fairytale ending @entity1 would have hoped for			0
the veteran looked confused by the various roles given to him by @entity18 and he failed to thrive in any of them			0
@entity1 leaves the pitch following his side 's 2 - 1 @entity9 semi-final defeat by @entity7			1

@entity1 started the game in an advanced role behind @entity29
the first half largely passed @entity1 by at @entity23
