by @entity0 the amount you use the web may not only be affecting your sleep and how you communicate , it could also be influencing who you find attractive			2
researchers have found that women who spend lots of time online prefer more masculine looking men , while men prefer more feminine , thinner women			1
the findings suggest that the internet - and most likely media portrayals of certain ' types ' - is associated with what people think is attractive			2
researchers found that women who spend lots of time online prefer more masculine men , while men with internet access prefer more feminine , thinner women			1
an ideal couple cited in the study included @entity27 ( right ) and @entity28 ( left ) specifically in the 2014 film @entity30 ( pictured ) @entity32 psychologist @entity31 , who led the study , said : ‘ one possibility for the difference is the level of media exposure			1
for decades , experts believed women flocked to silent types because of their aloof and mysterious nature - but new research suggests its because the trait is actually an ultimate sign of masculinity			0
on average , women talk three times as many words each day than men , and their brains are wired to recognise this trait			0
when a women meets a man who talks a lot , they consider them to be more feminine and less attractive , yet men who use shorter words and speak more concisely were seen as more attractive because they appeared more masculine			2
silent types who also have deep voices , such as @entity60 actor @entity59 , were considered the most attractive			0
' people with internet access are more exposed to the media , adverts or websites , which promotes the beauty ideals of muscly men and thin feminine women			1
’ as a recent example , the researchers cited the @entity60 blockbuster movie , @entity30 , in which the male lead is played by the masculine actor @entity27 , and the female lead is played by the feminine , thin @entity28			1
other masculine men include @entity76 , while @entity77 is an example of a thin , feminine woman			2
the research was carried out in @entity81 , where the majority of people ( 74 per cent ) do n’t have access to the internet			1
the study asked participants to choose between pictures of people higher or lower in weight , or higher or lower in masculinity and femininity			0
researchers found there was no difference in the preferences of those with access to the internet			2
almost exclusively , they preferred the faces that the internet might suggest are more ' attractive '			0
@entity32 psychologist @entity31 said one possibility for the difference is the level of media exposure			0
she said people with web access are more exposed to adverts which promote the beauty ideals of muscular men and feminine women			1
@entity27 is pictured left and @entity28 is pictured right other masculine men include @entity76 ( pictured left ) , while @entity77 ( pictured right ) is an example of a thin , feminine woman			1
the study claimed that people with internet access are more exposed to the media , adverts or websites , which promotes the beauty ideals of muscular men and feminine women however , non-internet users found masculine , heavier women more attractive , such as @entity120 who plays @entity121 in @entity122 ( pictured )			1
the research was carried out in @entity81 , where the majority of people ( 74 per cent ) do n't have access to the internet however , non-internet users found feminine men and masculine , heavier women more attractive			1
the study , published in the journal @entity132 , found people with internet access were more likely to have a television in their home , which exposed them even further to the media through commercials , television shows , and movies			2
researchers attributed these findings to several explanations , including economic circumstances influencing perceived attractiveness			0
professor @entity146 , of the @entity147 at @entity32 , said : ‘ one possibility is that the harshness of the environment may influence face preferences			0
‘ people without internet in the @entity81 study had fewer resources - such as no running water - and such harshness may be responsible for what they find attractive			1
‘ when income and access to food is uncertain , heavier women may be better equipped to survive and reproduce , and therefore preferences for heavier women could be adaptive			0
‘ our findings are consistent with previous literature that has found that heavier figures are considered more attractive in poorer and rural areas			0
’ the study asked participants to choose between pictures of people higher or lower in weight , or higher or lower in masculinity and femininity			0
women without web access found feminine men , such as @entity178 ( pictured left ) and @entity180 ( pictured right ) more attractive professor @entity31 added : ‘ our findings suggest that existing online studies may provide a distorted perspective of the populations in developing countries			1
‘ our data provide evidence that , even within a small country , sub-sectors of the population have different preferences			0
‘ future research should take this into account when studies are made in countries where a substantial portion of the population does not have internet access			0

researchers found women who spend time online prefer masculine men
while men with internet access prefer more feminine , thinner women
the couple cited in the study was @entity27 and @entity28
study was carried out in @entity81 , where 74 *%* do n’t have internet access
non-internet users found feminine men and masculine women attractive
this includes @entity120 who plays @entity121 in @entity122 , and @entity178
researchers claim the internet influences what people find attractive because it allows *greater* access to media , which portrays beauty ideals
