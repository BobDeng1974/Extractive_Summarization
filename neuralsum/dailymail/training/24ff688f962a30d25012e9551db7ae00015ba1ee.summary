@entity0 may have swapped @entity1 for @entity2 but he is still having an impact on his former club , having helped countryman @entity6 's move to @entity7			1
after impressing with @entity8 , the 21 - year - old left back was lured to north @entity10 by @entity11 in a deal worth a reported £ 10million			1
@entity6 had been attracting interest from @entity14 but plumped for a move to @entity1 - a decision swayed in part by @entity18 team - mate @entity0 , who enjoyed six years at the club before his world - record £ 86 million transfer to @entity2			1
@entity6 ( centre ) says he spoke to @entity18 team - mate @entity0 ahead of his @entity1 move ' i spoke to him briefly about it , nothing too in - depth , but it was nice just to have that insight from him , ' @entity6 said			1
' he told me what the club was like and how it worked , and what he said really appealed to me			2
' the transition 's been relatively easy for me			0
i 've enjoyed being up here and it 's a great opportunity for me to get away from home and to experience a new lifestyle			0
' i do n't think there 's any better time to do that than when you 're young , and it 's a learning curve really			0
' @entity6 joined the north @entity10 outfit for £ 10million from @entity44 rivals @entity8 in the summer @entity6 is clearly enjoying life in north @entity10 , although first - team opportunities have been harder to come by than many expected			1
it was widely - assumed his arrival would see @entity50 drop down the pecking order , although it is in fact the @entity53 who has so far played understudy at left back			0
@entity6 has been reduced to cup appearances and is set to come back into the starting line - up when @entity1 look for a first @entity57 win against @entity58 on thursday			1
' i think it 's a good competition for the club to be in , ' he said of the @entity57 - a tournament he played in with @entity8 last term			1
@entity0 enjoyed six years at @entity7 before joining @entity63 giants @entity2 last year ' it gives the entire squad an opportunity for games , and games at the top level at that			2
' the winner of this year 's competition is guaranteed a spot in next year 's @entity74 too , so we 've got to go into this competition looking to win it really , and if that means getting a @entity74 spot at the end of it then that 's great for us			0
' we 're expecting a tough game tomorrow			0
they are top of the league in our group and we 've got to go out there as if it 's a game against one of the best clubs in @entity90			0
' we 've got to put our performance right on the field first , and if that 's right then hopefully we 'll be able to get the three points			0
' @entity6 has found first - team opportunities hard to come by with @entity50 ( right ) often preferred at left back			2
