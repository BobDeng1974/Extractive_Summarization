read @entity1 's match report from the pulsating @entity3 semi-final first leg draw at @entity4 @entity5 's @entity3 semi-final with @entity7 is evenly poised going into next week ’s decisive second leg at @entity9 , but there is little doubt that @entity13 ’s side edged a 1 - 1 draw at @entity4 on tuesday night			1
a return to the high - octane displays of last season had the @entity19 leaders rocking on their heels in the second half as @entity13 out - manoeuvred his old @entity7 mentor @entity22 in most aspects of the game			1
@entity25 looks at how @entity5 ’s tactics have not only given them a real chance of reaching @entity28 but may also serve as a blueprint for the rest of the league in how to tackle @entity22 ’s men in the second half of the season			2
@entity13 ( left ) got the better of @entity22 as @entity5 and @entity7 drew 1 - 1 at @entity4 usually so impressive , @entity34 ( left ) struggled to break down @entity5 's attacks @entity36 ( left ) chases @entity37 during the @entity3 semi-final @entity38 @entity34 has been outstanding in his defensive midfield role this season , but the movement and trickery of @entity37 disrupted the axis of @entity34 and @entity44 in much the same way that @entity46 wreaked havoc with the @entity48 and @entity36 when @entity49 hammered @entity7 5 - 3 on @entity50			1
on tuesday night , they had no answer to @entity37 as he pulled them out of position , and it was no surprise that his pass split the pair in the build - up to @entity5 ’s equaliser			0
it was the first goal @entity7 had conceded in 341 minutes since @entity62 ’s effort for @entity49			0
@entity44 lunges in on @entity63 ( left ) during a pulsating match at @entity4 @entity65 had another difficult night at the heart of the @entity7 defence uncomfortable @entity68 @entity63 might have been recharging his batteries in @entity70 recently but it was @entity65 who looked like he was running on sand when his @entity75 team - mate scored a memorable goal to level the tie in the second half			1
again there were comparisons with the @entity49 game in the way that the direct running of @entity84 and @entity63 unsettled @entity65			0
the @entity7 defender inexplicably backed off @entity63 and failed to make a challenge as the @entity5 man powered past him en route to goal			1
it exposed a more general weakness on the right - hand side of @entity22 ’s defence with full - back @entity94 caught out of position on several occasions			0
@entity75 vice-captain @entity65 fouls @entity63 as he looks to get the upper hand on the @entity5 forward @entity63 bought himself a yard of space and shot across @entity101 to pull @entity5 level @entity63 celebrates after scoring a superb equaliser for the hosts in the 59th minute almost the entire @entity5 team rushed to congratulate their 20 - year - old attacker @entity107 @entity108 was in awesome form in @entity7 ’s 5 - 0 drubbing of @entity111 at the weekend as the @entity19 ’s top scorer added another two to go even further ahead with 17 goals			1
however , @entity5 shut down the @entity115 striker with @entity116 particularly effective at anticipating balls into him and giving @entity108 little time or space			0
as a consequence , @entity7 ’s £ 32million man cut an increasingly frustrated figure as he became involved in spats with several @entity5 players and was taunted by the home supporters			2
@entity108 ( left ) was brilliantly marshalled by @entity116 and failed to register a shot on target @entity7 's star striker , seen here arguing with @entity129 , cut a frustrated figure at @entity4 @entity131 intentional fouling is not to be applauded but neither should teams simply sit back and allow themselves to be ripped apart by the brilliance of players like @entity136			2
@entity5 trod a fine line at times and @entity139 and @entity140 were both booked for taking down the mercurial @entity141			0
however , @entity13 showed that @entity136 can be stopped by putting two men – sometimes three – on him to close him down every time he got the ball			0
the result was that @entity136 had surprisingly little impact on the game after winning and converting a penalty in the first half			2
@entity149 ( right ) had been caught out of position before tripping the onrushing @entity136 in the box hazard wheels away after sending @entity5 goalkeeper @entity154 the wrong way from the penalty spot the @entity141 looks to twist his way past @entity158 , but found it difficult to find space at @entity4 press the @entity161 few teams can press as well as @entity7 , but @entity5 provided a masterclass in the art as they returned to the high - energy performances of last season			1
insatiable in attack as they powered towards @entity170 in the second half , @entity13 ’ side were equally breathless in defence as they swarmed all over @entity7 like an army of red ants			0
@entity4 reverberated in its appreciation of the effort and @entity22 ’s side were simply not allowed to have the time on the ball or the composure to establish their normal tempo and control over the game			0
@entity139 - mocked for slipping in the decisive @entity19 fixture last year - drove the @entity184 on but for @entity101 , @entity5 would have won the game against @entity7 at @entity4 on tuesday evening @entity13 has promised all season his side would regain their tempo and they did on tuesday @entity7 manager @entity22 chats with former colleague @entity13 in the @entity4 tunnel			1

@entity5 drew 1 - 1 with @entity7 in @entity3 semi-final first leg
blues were lucky to draw after brilliant second half from @entity5
@entity136 gave @entity7 a first - half lead with an 18th - minute penalty
@entity63 equalised with *stunning* solo effort after the break
