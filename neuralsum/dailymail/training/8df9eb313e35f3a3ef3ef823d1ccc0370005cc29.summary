by @entity0 twenty one years ago this week , @entity1 launched his iconic vacuum cleaner in the @entity3			2
today , millions of these vacuums are helping clean dirt in households across the world – but despite global success , it seems there is one design the engineer may be kicking himself for not pursuing			0
according to recently revealed documents , @entity3 ’s most famous modern inventor may have been better known for his own version of @entity15 , had he not shelved the idea in 2001			0
according to recently revealed documents , @entity3 ’s most famous modern inventor may have been better known for his own version of @entity15 , had he not shelved the idea in 2001			0
pictured is an early prototype the documents show how thirteen years ago , the @entity21 – based company developed an augmented reality headset that it intended to call @entity23			1
early designs of the @entity26 prototype suggest it would have been a cross between @entity15 and a @entity28 , with thin metal band surrounding by wires			1
the system , referred to under the secret project name @entity33 , could be carried in the user 's pocket , working both as a communications device and computer			1
@entity15 , pictured here worn by founder @entity38 , is now becoming increasingly popular gadget			0
however , many people have voiced concerns over intrusions into privacy using the technology early designs of the @entity26 prototype suggest it would have been a cross between @entity15 and a @entity28 , with thin metal band surrounding by wires			1
given the secret project name @entity33 , the device could be carried in the user 's pocket , working both as a communications device and computer on the headset , two plane mirrors reflected the display of two tiny monitors which were mounted close to the wearer ’s temples , onto a prism			1
pictured is an early sketch of the system the headset			0
which may be folded , could be used in audio only mode using voice commands and text - to - speech			0
this design sketch shows the headset folded together @entity1 had other inventions that never made the cut			1
among them , was a fuel cell , which would have allowed @entity1 ’s digital motor in its vacuums to run on hydrogen and oxygen			1
hydrogen fuel cells convert chemical energy from hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy			2
fuel cells require a large , constant source of both hydrogen and oxygen to run , but produce electricity continuously			2
for three years , 10 @entity1 engineers worked to adapt a @entity1 digital motor so it could sit at the heart of a fuel cell			1
the aim was to increase performance whilst reducing size			0
the eventually designed a compact , lightweight and highly efficient digital motor @entity94 resulted in a 20 per cent increase in power density and improved efficiency			2
the start - up time became almost three times faster			0
on the headset , two plane mirrors reflected the display of two tiny monitors which were mounted close to the wearer ’s temples , onto a prism			0
this created an illusion of a projected , translucent , 10inch ( 25cm ) display around three feet ( one metre ) in front of the user			1
a virtual personal assistant , similar to @entity113 , could read out emails and interpret basic voice commands			1
@entity1 also intended a keyboard to be projected in front of the user so that one could type and write emails on any surface			1
which could be folded , had the option of being used in audio only mode with voice commands and text - to - speech			0
the idea was that users could drive while using the computer , or use it on the go without the display , giving the effect of having a personal assistant whispering in your ear			1
the headset could be detached from the wearable computer , and the mobile device could be docked into a monitor to become a desktop computer , giving the same effect as plugging a laptop into a tv			2
the headset could be detached from the wearable computer , and the mobile device could be docked into a monitor to become a desktop computer , giving the same effect as plugging a laptop into a tv , as shown in this sketch from 2003 a wrist - worn device could then serve as a mouse , allowing the user to control the virtual cursor on the display			1
@entity1 engineers spent three years working on @entity26 , only to put it aside with plans to focus on getting more market - ready goods on to the market			0
the group had other inventions that never made the cut			2
among them , was diesel trap for vehicle that used @entity1 ’s cyclone technology to capture and filter particles coming from car engines			2
another design was for a fuel cell , which would have allowed @entity1 ’s digital motor in its vacuums to run on hydrogen and oxygen			1
the company said elements of these decades - old technologies are now being used in future research projects			0

the augmented reality headset was intended to be called @entity23
it would have looked like a cross between @entity15 and a @entity28
@entity205 could work both as a communications device and computer
it would show a translucent , 10 inch display 3 feet in front of the user
a virtual personal assistant , similar to @entity113 , could read out emails
other inventions that did *n't* make the cut *include* a diesel filter for cars
the group also developed fuel cell technology which would allow digital motor in @entity1 's vacuums to run on hydrogen and oxygen
