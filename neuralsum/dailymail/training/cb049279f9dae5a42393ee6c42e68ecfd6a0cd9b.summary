if @entity1 stumble upon a little bit of good fortune this season , then @entity0 help the rest of the championship			1
on saturday evening , despite his team sitting top of the table , @entity7 was still convinced and concerned that the footballing deities had deserted him			2
' they say these things even themselves out over the season and we 've had our share of bad luck , ' @entity7 lamented			2
@entity1 boss @entity7 was frustrated with his side 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity21 - his team have not won at home since mid-august @entity23 scored @entity1 's equaliser against @entity21 but missed good chances during the match ' you normally get one a season but we 've had freak games back - to - back			1
' the @entity1 manager certainly could be forgiven for feeling a sense of deja vu			2
on saturday , as in tuesday 's 1 - 0 home defeat by @entity35 , his team had created enough chances against @entity21 to win four or five games but saw precious points slip through their fingers			1
but they remain top after rivals @entity40 did them a favour by holding @entity43 to a draw on sunday			1
the @entity1 fell behind to @entity21 courtesy of @entity47 's penalty having had the better of the match it certainly is freakish that the @entity1 are flying so high having not won at home in the league since mid-august			1
not since @entity54 returned to the top tier in one attempt in 2009 - 2010 has a side relegated from the @entity53 started so well in the division below — but @entity7 was justified in thinking they should have more			2
@entity1 lost 1 - 0 at home against @entity35 despite completely dominating the game from start to finish ' it 's an opportunity lost , ' he continued			1
' we 've totally dominated and again i 've got an opposition manager saying : ' i do n't know how the hell we 've got anything from that			0
'' @entity21 's @entity70 had a point			0
this was an afternoon of yellow - shirted dominance			0
@entity75 rampaged down the right , @entity74 stormed down the left			0
crosses whizzed in pretty much every minute			0
@entity23 had four good opportunities before he finally made one count			0
@entity1 crafted 27 openings in all but lacked ruthlessness			0
despite the two dropped points , the manner of the performance still showed that @entity1 this season — in contrast to @entity87 and @entity88 — are a textbook example of how to cope with life after the @entity53			2
@entity7 believes that with players like @entity93 ( right ) , the team will start winning home matches having played 206 times for the club and taking charge of the academy , @entity7 was rightly given his chance at the top job			1
with some quality players retained and a revamped front line of @entity23 ( seven goals so far ) and @entity93 ( six ) they have hit the ground running			0
@entity7 added : ' there 's very little wrong with the performances			0
it just is n't going our way , particularly at home			0
' the october internationals are a good time to take stock and @entity70 , too , can be content with how things are going			0
his @entity21 side were not without clear - cut chances and took the lead when @entity47 rolled home a penalty after @entity122 had clattered @entity123			2
@entity1 remained top of the championship after @entity43 drew 2 - 2 with @entity40 on sunday after four successive promotion seasons — two with @entity126 , two with the @entity127 — @entity70 is probably finding it a little frustrating to sit 17th , and he said as much afterwards			1
' we 're five or six points light of where we deserve to be , ' he said			0
' those who watched us against @entity133 and @entity134 ( both 2 - 0 defeats ) saw total domination in both games			1
and if you 'd watched us at @entity40 ( another 2 - 0 defeat ) , you 'd think @entity21 were the established @entity140 team			1
' what 's caught my eye @entity146 's comments when asked if @entity147 were in crisis following their draw at @entity150 : ' crisis is what is happening to people who go out to work for @entity154 and lose their life			0
' plenty of incident in the @entity158 vs @entity160 derby , with @entity162 striker @entity161 and @entity164 keeper @entity163 seeing red			0
@entity158 won 3 - 2			2
@entity166 resigned as @entity168 manager after a 3 - 0 home defeat to fellow strugglers @entity171 left them rock bottom of @entity174			1
performance of the week @entity176 for @entity177 at long last on friday as they beat @entity88 1 - 0 to drag themselves off the foot of the @entity140 — a first win of the season			1
could it be the start of a great escape ? @entity184 ( centre right ) scored the only goal of the game for @entity177 in their 1 - 0 win against @entity88			1

@entity1 could only draw 1 - 1 with @entity21 on saturday
in their previous match the @entity1 lost 1 - 0 at home to @entity35
in both matches , @entity7 ' side missed a number of good chances
desite the *setbacks* , @entity1 are top of the championship after @entity43 only drew 2 - 2 with @entity40
@entity7 believes his side are *due* some good fortune
elsewhere in the championship this weekend , @entity177 beat @entity88 1 - 0 to record their first win of the season
