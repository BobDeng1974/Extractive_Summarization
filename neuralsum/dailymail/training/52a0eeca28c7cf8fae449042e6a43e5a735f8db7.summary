by @entity0 and @entity1 not content with breaking its own previous altitude records , an incredible video of @entity4 's @entity3 reveals the latest test flight also managed to smash through the sound barrier			1
the video , taken by cameras placed on carrier plane @entity11 , show @entity3 reaching its maximum velocity of @entity14 , approximately 767mph at sea level			1
any speeds faster than @entity17 are considered supersonic			2
the test at @entity19 and and @entity20 in @entity21 was designed to simulate a flight into outer space that will go into effect later this year			2
this is approximately 767 mph at sea level , and helped the craft reach an altitude of 71,000ft above the @entity31 in @entity21 @entity4 eventually wants to host commercial space tours			1
@entity3 reached its maximum velocity of @entity14 , which is equivalent to approximately 767mph at sea level			1
the speeds during this third test flight also helped the aircraft reach an altitude of 71,000ft			1
the flight prior to this test reached 69,000ft			0
pilot @entity42 successfully piloted the aircraft and returned it safely back to @entity44			1
following the flight he said the experience was a ' dream come true			0
' this is the first flight in which a @entity50 pilot sat in the cockpit			0
the speeds during this third test flight also helped the aircraft reach an altitude of 71,000ft - the flight prior to this test reached 69,000ft			1
cameras mounted on @entity3 , including one mounted on a tail boom , captured various angles and views of the rocket soaring into the sky			2
@entity4 also included a rear - facing camera on @entity3 that showed the trail of smoke as the aircraft reached new heights			1
pilot @entity42 successfully piloted the aircraft and returned it safely back to @entity44			1
following the flight he said the experience was a ' dream come true			0
' this is the first flight in which a @entity50 pilot sat in the cockpit			0
@entity76 test pilot @entity75 was beside @entity77 in the cockpit			0
meanwhile , @entity4 's @entity79 and @entity76 's @entity80 were at the controls of @entity3 's mothership , @entity11			1
one day soon : in this image , @entity3 is shown igniting her hybrid rocket motor which will take paying customers into space during the first part of the test flight , @entity3 was tucked beneath twin - fuselage @entity11			1
this particular test was meant to monitor the thermal coating on the tail of the spacecraft as well as the ship 's control system that helps the pilot make his way out of outer space , and give space tourists the best views			0
together the planes took off at 7:20 am pt and rose to 46,000ft			0
after 46,000ft , the pilots unhooked @entity3 for a rocket blast			2
the plane is then shown coasting in the sky following the burn before the pilots positioned its wings to ensure a stable descent			0
minutes later , once the wings were straight , the plane landed on @entity114 12,000ft runway with @entity11 landing minutes afterwards			2
test flight in january : it was the first flight in which a @entity50 pilot sat in the cockpit @entity3 blast - off is also visible from this rear - facing camera during a test at @entity19 and and @entity20 in @entity21 @entity3 is seen here moments before ignition of her hybrid rocket motor , as seen from carrier plane @entity11			1
@entity4 eventually wants to host commercial space tours with @entity128 and @entity129 said to have already bought tickets worth $ 250,000 ( £ 152,000 ) ' i have watched @entity133 evolve over the years into an incredible vehicle that is going to open up space to more people than ever before , ' @entity77 said			1
' to be behind the controls and fly it as the rocket ignited is something i will never forget			0
she flew like a champ			0
' @entity3 is a enhanced version of @entity144			0
the original rocket plane , which won the $ 10 million @entity146 for private spaceflight in 2004 in @entity31 , now lives at the @entity149 's @entity148			0
joined : @entity3 is seen tucked beneath twin - fuselage @entity11 as it flies into the @entity152 skies @entity4 's ceo sir @entity153 ( right ) ' high tens ' with @entity3 test pilot @entity155 ( left ) following the successful first powered flight of @entity3 ' 2014 will be the year when we will finally put our beautiful spaceship in her natural environment of space			1
today , we had our own chief pilot flying another flawless supersonic flight and proving the various systems required to take us safely to space , as well as providing the very best experience while we ’re up there , ' said @entity4 ceo @entity153			1
celebrities have already started signing up for the exclusive space tours ready to take off later this year			0
@entity171 reports that @entity128 and @entity129 have already signed up			0
tickets cost $ 250,000 ( £ 152,000 )			0
ceo @entity153 has promised to take a seat on the ship 's first flight			2
@entity153 hopes to move the passenger flight base to @entity177 in @entity152 .			2

@entity3 is shown being tucked under carrier plane @entity11
it is then filmed falling away before using its hybrid rocket engine
during the flight , the aircraft travelled at its maximum velocity of @entity14
supersonic speeds helped the craft reach altitudes of 71,000ft
@entity4 pilot @entity42 successfully piloted @entity3
@entity153 says commercial space flights will occur later this year
