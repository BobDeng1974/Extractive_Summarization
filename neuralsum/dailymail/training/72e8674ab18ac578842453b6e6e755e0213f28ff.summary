by @entity1 reporter published : 02:53 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 08:08 est , 9 december 2013 @entity2 has been praised for her lengthy true - to - life accounts of @entity5 - but when it comes to her personal viewing , it seems her tastes are a little less high - brow			1
the double @entity14 prizewinner has admitted she was an avid fan of @entity15 , the @entity11 show panned by critics for its ' sexed - up , dumbed down ' version of @entity18 history			1
the series began in 2007 as the 61 - year - old author was writing her first novel , @entity22 , and received hundreds of complaints from viewers and academics who claimed to spot modern radiators , @entity28 driveways , concrete bollards and @entity31 carriages			1
left , @entity35 as @entity36 and @entity37 as @entity38 ms @entity2 giggled as she told @entity39 of the @entity40 that she watched the show ' avidly '			1
she later explained that it was important to see the show because it would have an effect on how the @entity48 public thought of the @entity15 when her first novel was released in 2009			2
' it would condition the world into which @entity22 would be born , ' she said			1
and despite enjoying the programme , the author tactfully confessed that casting the slim , brooding @entity35 as the obese wife - killer @entity54 was ' stretching it a bit '			2
' you never translate your character into the body of some living person you ’d seen out there , ' she said			0
' when you are writing , your characters are flickering constructs , they are always on the move			0
it ’s much more like people you know well in real life			0
sexed - up : the @entity15 , which began in 2007 , was criticised for its historical inaccuracies and the choice of @entity35 , left , to play the dark and brooding @entity36 and @entity73 : @entity74 as @entity75 raunchy : the drama contained several explicit sex scenes , including one four minutes into the first episode passionate : but viewers claimed they spotted modern radiators , concrete bollards and @entity31 carriages acclaimed : ms @entity2 's weighty first two novels in her @entity86 trilogy have each won a @entity14 prize ' you are not looking at them fixedly every moment to judge their features , what you do have is a general impression of them , of their energy			1
this means your concept of who can represent that character is totally flexible			0
' there could be exceptions : when they cast @entity35 as @entity36 in @entity15 , i thought that was stretching it a bit			0
' justified : the author said @entity15 conditioned the world into which her first novel was born with its raunchy explicit sex scenes the @entity11 drama , which ran for four series , was part of a bid to interest younger audiences in history			1
but it strayed too far from the truth for some			0
@entity120 , a @entity122 biographer , said : ' overall the series is badly written with an extremely cheap feel to it			2
' it is hugely disappointing			0
with inaccuracies in almost every sentence , the @entity11 is dumbing down the tudor period			1
' the characters talk in completely unnatural ways , addressing their own family members as " @entity75 " or " @entity133 " so that we , the stupid audience , understand who they 're supposed to be			0
' @entity36 was exceedingly powerful , both politically and physically , but @entity35 is pretty , rather than macho and thus completely unconvincing			0
' ms @entity2 is the only author ever to have won two @entity14 prizes for the first two books in a trilogy , @entity22 and bring up the @entity140			1
her trilogy is about @entity86 , a little - known adviser to @entity54 , and the third book is due out within the next few years			0
meanwhile the author is putting together a stage version of @entity22 with the @entity145 , which will open in @entity146 this week .			2

@entity11 show was panned by critics for its ' poor ' casting and sex scenes
but ms @entity2 told a *magazine* she watched the drama series ' avidly '
it conditioned the world into which her first novel @entity22 was born
