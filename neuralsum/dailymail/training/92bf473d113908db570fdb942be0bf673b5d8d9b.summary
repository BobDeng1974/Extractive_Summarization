@entity3 , 47 , who suffers from cerebral palsy , made the gesture as he played at his local bingo hall but was carried out when managers branded him ' sexist '			1
@entity17 called 999 after he rowed with employees , and he was subsequently escorted from the building by two burly officers from @entity21			1
mr @entity3 , who has been to @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 , four times a week for the last eight years , has now been banned , and all because he made what he believes was a harmless ' joke '			1
he fumed : ' everyone whistles when number 11 comes out , i was just having a bit of banter			1
i do n’t know why they ( the management ) singled me out			1
' to start with , they said it ’s a private club and they did n’t have to give a reason for barring me			2
' to be honest , i did argue and refuse to leave , which was wrong , but i was exasperated			1
i did get a bit upset , i certainly was n’t aggressive			1
' my face just did n’t fit , there was a minority of people in there who seemed to be prejudiced against me from the moment i arrived			2
' on the day it was quite weird			2
i whistled at the call for ‘ @entity50 ’ with other people , and the caller actually came over to me and shouted at me to stop whistling saying it was sexist			0
' i thought nothing of that and was waiting for one final number to get a full house			0
' when i did n’t get it i said " stuff " it ’ in jest , it was a joke			1
i was told by someone in management that i had been rude and said a bad word to a female staff member			1
' i was with a witness , a friend from the church , and she can back up that i never did that			0
' the next thing i knew , two police officers were walking towards me and they got hold of each arm and frogmarched me out of the building			2
joke : the cerebral palsy sufferer had been going to the hall in @entity24 four times a week since 2006 ejected : after he was carried out , officers told him he should not go back inside , so was forced to go home no comment : a spokesman from @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 , said it was an ' internal matter ' frustrated : mr @entity3 , who suffers from cerebral palsy , is at a loss as he does not know where else he can go 1 : @entity88 2 : one @entity89 7 : @entity90 8 : one fat lady 17 : often be kissed 28 : overweight 56 : was she worth it ? 69 : your place or mine 80 : @entity98 's breakfast 83 : fat lady with a flea 88 : two fat ladies ' the officers told me i should n’t go back inside so i just went home			1
' i was shocked , i ’ve never caused any trouble in my life			0
' i just wanted to play bingo and have a bit of fun with my friends			2
' now i feel like my self - confidence has been hit , i feel everyone in the world should need a good reason to think someone else is bad and i do n’t think i have done anything			0
' it ’s all i ’ve got at the present time			0
i do n’t drink and i do n’t like pubs			0
i ’ve nowhere else to go			0
' ' a spokesman for @entity121 ’s refused to comment on the ban saying : “ we have no comment to make			2
this is an internal matter			0
' but a source at the club admitted there had been complaints about mr @entity3 's raucous response to the call and general loud behaviour			0
he stressed that despite calling police there was no suggestion mr @entity3 was violent			0
in 2012 @entity135 came under fire after it emerged the government were planning to out - law wolf - whistling .			0
