@entity1 boss @entity0 accused @entity3 winger @entity2 and referee @entity4 of cheating his team after a controversial penalty decision at the @entity7 on sunday			1
@entity0 , who now faces an @entity9 disciplinary charge , called for @entity2 to be punished for diving			1
the @entity1 boss added that if he had ‘ dived ’ in that manner he would have been too ashamed to face his own family			1
but when @entity2 tumbled in the penalty area shortly before the break @entity4 was convinced and awarded his second spot - kick of the match			1
the 29 - year - old @entity19 official had earlier upset @entity3 by penalising @entity20 for impeding @entity21 at a corner , and the debate completely overshadowed @entity24 ’ 76th - minute winner			1
@entity24 watches as his well - placed header sails past the dive of @entity28 and into the corner of the net @entity24 runs away to celebrate his goal as @entity3 earned three points against @entity1 at the @entity7 @entity34 scores from the spot to level for @entity3 after @entity2 went down under the challenge of @entity37 @entity21 sends @entity38 the wrong way to put @entity1 ahead as @entity0 's side looked to regain some form in the top flight @entity43 , who scored three goals on international duty last week , looked bright early on for @entity1 at the @entity7 @entity46 runs at the @entity3 defence as @entity1 looked to play positive football at the @entity7 @entity4 is surrounded by @entity3 players after awarding a controversial penalty against @entity20 for fouling @entity21 @entity3 : @entity38 6 ; @entity51 6 , @entity20 5.5 , @entity52 6 , @entity53 6.5 ; @entity54 5.5 , @entity34 7.5 ; @entity55 5.5 ( @entity24 62 , 7 ) , @entity56 6.5 ( @entity57 62 , 6 ) , @entity2 7 ( @entity58 73 , 6.5 ) ; @entity59 6			1

‘ he should be punished for diving , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ it ’s a clear dive , which is cheating			2
he ’s cheated the ref and then the ref ’s cheated us			2
‘ it ’s one of the most blatant dives you ’ll ever see			2
you go and watch a million games and you wo n’t see more of a dive than that			2
he should be ashamed of himself			2
i would n’t be able to go home to my family and show my face			0
this is how i live my life			0
they can do what they want , but for me it ’s a disgrace			0
‘ there was absolute minimal contact with @entity37			0
( @entity2 ) has thrown himself to the floor			1
it is more laughable every time i watch it			0
it ’s very hard to take when it ’s so blatant and you see him being rewarded for it			0
‘ anyone who simulates in training ( at @entity1 ) is fined			1
i would n’t have it			0
if my player did that he would n’t play in the next game			0
the referee has taken the easy option to give the penalty			2
it ’s a massive game - changing moment , and a disgusting decision			1
he ’s the only guy in the whole stadium that thought that was a clear - cut penalty			1
i looked straight at their bench and even they could n’t believe he ’d given it			0
’ @entity0 also hit out at referees ’ chief @entity138 for failing to respond to his concerns over decisions he feels have gone against @entity1 this season			1
he said that the club had already gone over @entity138 ’s head before yesterday ’s game by sending a letter and dvd of some of the incidents to @entity67 , chairman of @entity149 , last week			0
‘ i have n’t had anything back from @entity138 which is astonishing to me and poor leadership , ’ he added			0
@entity3 worked the ball wide before crossing for @entity24 to head home the winner			1
click here to see more from our brilliant @entity157 the penalty was @entity21 's second goal of the season after breaking his duck against @entity163 before the international break @entity21 celebrates his goal but @entity3 felt that the penalty was harsh , as the ball was sailing way over the striker 's head from a corner the goal was no more than @entity1 deserved after a strong start during which saw @entity38 make two good saves in the @entity3 goal @entity52 is put under pressure by @entity21 as @entity1 looked to press from the front and deny their opponents time on the ball @entity0 and @entity179 watch on as their two sides cancelled each other out in a hard - fought first half @entity55 tries a spectacular piece of skill under pressure from @entity69 as @entity3 tried to hit back before half time @entity37 and @entity187 react with disbelief as @entity2 goes down under the slightest contact to win a penalty for @entity3 @entity2 wins a penalty for @entity3 after a challenge from @entity1 defender @entity37 @entity34 made no mistake from 12 yards to put @entity3 level before the break , firing beyond the dive of @entity28 in the @entity1 goal @entity199 miles @entity3 107.8 67 @entity200 90 11.1 6.9 @entity59 90 11.1 6.9 @entity34 90 11.1 6.9 @entity1 107 66.5 ki 90 11.2 7 @entity201 90 11 6.8 @entity37 90 10.3 6.4 data courtesy of the @entity203 , the @entity204 of the @entity205 ‘ his job is to ring me , my job is not to ring him			1
he ’s supposed to be the head of these guys			0
‘ we ’ve sent off a dvd with a letter , ( expressing ) my disappointment at no contact from @entity138			0
i think it ’s about being proactive , but he ’s clearly not proactive , so i have to go above him and hopefully that will send the right message and i can get the right answers			0
’ @entity3 manager @entity179 was quick to defend @entity2 and said that @entity0 , the @entity205 ’s youngest manager at 35 , had showed a lack of experience with his outburst			1
‘ it ’s a situation that he needs to learn from , ’ said @entity179			0
‘ he is disappointed but the longer you ’re in this game , the more experience you get and sometimes you have to curb what you really feel			0
‘ there was no need for that from my point of view			0
i do n’t think he ( @entity2 ) dived			2
i think he felt contact			0
he was running at pace between two defenders and the onus is on the defender not to go anywhere near him			2
‘ from the angle i ’ve seen , there ’s a definite movement from @entity37 to put his arm across @entity2 and knock him off his stride			1
it ’s a soft one and you can argue about it as much as you like			0
he gave it and that ’s the end of it			0
’ while @entity0 claimed that @entity20 dragging @entity21 to the ground was a clear penalty , @entity179 is concerned that his captain ’s reputation counted against him			1
‘ for whatever reason , people are trying to highlight @entity20 over most defenders in terms of him being more adept at holding people in the box , which is pure nonsense , ’ said @entity179			2
‘ maybe the referee had seen a bit of the media coverage			0
every time there ’s a corner against us the cameras go straight to @entity20			1
the referee will have done his pre-match work and maybe it ’s been highlighted to him			0
’ amid the controversy , @entity24 ’ winner was almost forgotten after he headed in a cross from @entity58 , another @entity3 substitute			1
@entity273 lifted @entity3 up to 10th place , level on points with @entity1			1
so what did @entity277 make of it all ? ‘ i think because he gave the first one , he ’s given the second one , ’ he said with a smile			0
@entity34 celebrates his equaliser but @entity1 were livid that @entity2 , a constant thorn in their side , had been awarded the soft penalty @entity187 , who missed a great chance for @entity1 in the first half , closes down @entity3 striker @entity59 @entity201 runs past @entity34 as @entity1 tried to re-impose their control on the game after the break ki battles for the ball with @entity294 during a performance from the @entity296 which was full of quality but lacked killer instinct @entity43 tries to skip away from @entity34 's tackle but @entity1 found clear cut chances fewer and further between as the game wore on the direct running and tricky footwork of @entity2 was a constant threat for @entity3 before the @entity305 loanee was replaced on 72 minutes @entity24 arrives unmarked to head home the winner for @entity179 ' side after coming off the bench at the @entity7 @entity24 was clearly delighted with his impact as @entity3 held out against some late pressure from @entity1 @entity24 is mobbed by his @entity3 team - mates after securing a vital three points for the hosts against a strong @entity1 side			1
