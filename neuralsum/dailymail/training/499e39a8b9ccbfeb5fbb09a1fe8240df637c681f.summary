by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor emergency powers are to be introduced to stamp out an invasion of killer @entity5 hornet			0
ministers fear the impact on public health if swift action is not taken to deal with swarms of the deadly insects arriving on @entity14 shores			2
new species control orders will give the authorities power to wipeout animals , plants and pests which pose a threat to the health and security of the nation			1
new @entity25 will be used to stamp out foreign invaders , including the @entity27 which has killed six people in @entity29 fears have been growing about the imminent arrival of the killer hornets , which can eat up to 50 honey bees each a day			2
the come from @entity34 but have spread around the world and in @entity29 six people have died from anaphylactic shock after being stung			0
beekeepers have been enlisted to keep watch for the arrival of the insects , but the government fears existing powers are too limited to deal with an invasion when it happens			1
the @entity44 , unveiled in today ’s @entity45 , includes details of a new battleplan to deal with invasive non-native species			1
it will introduce new controls for when landowners , homeowners or business are unable or unwilling to act to deal with the arrival of species which threaten the country			1
special control orders will control ‘ the invasive , non-native species that pose serious threats to biodiversity , the water environment and infrastructure ’			1
details of the new control orders were included in the @entity44 , announced by the @entity64 in the @entity65 the @entity34 term for hornets is ' hu feng '			1
those behind the deadly attacks this summer appear to be the @entity71 , or vespa mandarinia			0
the asian giant hornet grows up to 5cm long with a 6mm sting which injects a large amount of potent venom			0
the hornet sting can be extremely painful to humans and has been compared to a hot nail being hammered into the body , the head of the hornet is orange and quite wide in comparison to other hornet species			2
the asian giant hornet is intensely predatory ; it hunts medium - to large - sized insects , such as bees , other hornet species , and mantises			1
hornets are most aggressive in behavior when they mate and migrate in september and october			0
attacks are difficult to prevent because hornet nests are usually in hidden sites			0
the orders will be available to deal with any new , dangerous species but government sources suggested the @entity27 poses the greatest imminent threat			1
it will not apply to existing problem species , like @entity102 @entity101 , but act as a rapid response to deal with future threats before they take hold			1
people who find the hornets are urged not to approach their nests but to contact the authorities			2
exterminators will be deployed to destroy their nests , normally found high in tees or in buildings , with chemicals or by burning them			0
the @entity117 said ' most , if not all ' cases are dealt with voluntarily , but when speed is of the essence the new powers would enable swift action to be taken			2
it is thought the new control orders would be used once a year , in an attempt to stop invasive species gaining a foothold in @entity128			1
it follows a call from a committee of mps for urgent action to better protect @entity128 from foreign invaders			0
the @entity135 said : ‘ there is a clear need for species control agreements and species control orders to ensure effectiveness of rapid response plans to eradicate invasive species before they can become established			1
‘ they could help avoid wasted effort and expenditure on large - scale control or eradication programmes , which might otherwise fail if access to all affected land could not be secured			2
’ it followed a warning from the @entity151 that the government should tighten the invasive species legislation for @entity128 and @entity154 as a top priority			0
the government said that the @entity44 would also clear the way for new roads , exploration of fracking and freeing up public land for homes			1
the changes will see the @entity163 ( @entity163 ) transformed into a government - owned company			0
the government reckons the move , covering @entity128 's motorways and major a-roads , will save taxpayers at least £ 2.6 billion over the next 10 years			0
however the government is risking the ire of environmental campaigners and its own supporters with changes to laws to make it easier to frack under people 's homes .			0

new species control orders will enable rapid response to natural threats
authorities will have power to wipeout animals , plants and insects
follows fears that rows with landowners creates *unnecessary* delays
@entity44 also which promises more roads , shale *gas* and homes
