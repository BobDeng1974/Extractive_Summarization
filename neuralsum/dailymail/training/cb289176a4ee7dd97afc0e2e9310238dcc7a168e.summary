an extinct fox that trod the ice - covered @entity1 five million years ago has been unearthed			1
with its razor sharp teeth , @entity3 was a ferocious hunter and predated well - known @entity7 creatures such as woolly mammoths and sabre tooth cats			2
the fox adds to a growing body of evidence that the mountains and nearby @entity14 were ‘ a cradle of evolution ’ for mammals living in a cold climate that fanned out as the @entity7 gripped the planet			1
with its razor sharp teeth , @entity3 ( pictured in the foreground ) was a ferocious hunter that predated well known @entity7 creatures such as woolly mammoths and sabre tooth cats			2
this is an artist 's impression of the @entity28 fauna during the @entity29 the fox lived between 3.6 million and five million years ago at a time when the @entity32 was a little warmer than @entity14			1
like modern arctic foxes , the ancient creature has long , sharp teeth for hunting			0
based upon the fossilised lower jawbone and teeth , unearthed between 2006 and 2012 , dr @entity39 , of the @entity40 of @entity41 believes the creature was as large as a big male modern fox , and around 20 per cent larger than a modern arctic fox			1
the @entity45 fox , described in @entity46 , predates by three to four million years the previous oldest record of the arctic fox , whose geographical range is at least 1,240 miles ( 1,996km ) away			2
like modern arctic foxes , ( pictured ) the ancient creature has long , sharp teeth for hunting @entity14 is known as the ‘ third pole ’ of the world			2
it includes @entity54 and the adjacent @entity55 , which is endowed with more frozen terrain than anywhere else on @entity58 except the @entity59			0
around three years ago , a woolly rhino fossil was found in the @entity61 on the north face of the @entity55			0
it lived some 3.6 million years ago , long before similar beasts roamed northern @entity65 and @entity66 in the ice ages that gripped those regions			1
dr @entity39 said : ‘ such a model of megafauna coming down from high mountains to spread to the rest of the cold steppes in northern @entity75 and @entity76 offer a scenario of the origin of cold adapted forms			0
‘ the apparent connection between an ancestral high elevation species and its modern polar descendant is consistent with our out of @entity14 hypothesis postulating high altitude @entity14 was a training ground for cold environment adaptations well before the start of the @entity7			1
‘ in addition to the @entity45 fox , we have also discovered ancestors of snow leopard , hunting dog and running hyena , all of them highly predacious based on their teeth			0
’ the giants of the @entity7 such as woolly mammoths , rhinos , great sloths and sabre tooth cats , which arrived at least a million years later , have been intensively studied in recent years			1
but much less is known about where the beasts came from and how they acquired their adaptations for living in the freezing cold			0
@entity3 was a ferocious hunter that lived in the @entity1 , along the border of @entity110 and in nearby @entity14 ( marked at a ) between 3.6 million and five million years ago researchers believe the megafauna were descendants of the @entity29 era between 5.3 million and 2.6 million years ago after their ancestors used @entity14 as a ‘ training ground '			1
modern @entity32 carnivores such as polar bear , grey wolves and arctic foxes are all highly predatory because of the large amount of energy required to live in such an extreme environment , which is all but devoid of plant food during the winter			0
dr @entity39 said that the @entity14 carnivore community would have also had the same appetite for meat millions of years ago			2
@entity14 is known as the ' third pole ' of the world			0
the @entity1 that run along its border include @entity54 ( pictured ) and the adjacent @entity55 , which is endowed with more frozen terrain than anywhere else on @entity58 except the @entity59			0

@entity3 was a hunter living in the @entity1 and @entity14
the ancient fox lived between 3.6 million and five million years ago
*experts* think the creature was around the same size as a large modern fox
they claim @entity14 was a training ground for cold environment adaptations well before the start of the @entity7
