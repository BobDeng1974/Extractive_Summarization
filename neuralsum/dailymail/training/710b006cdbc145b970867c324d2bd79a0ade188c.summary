by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:47 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 16:16 est , 11 march 2013 the former head of transportation security says a new policy that allows small knives on commercial planes does n't go far enough , and should include weapons such as ' battle axes ' and ' machetes			1
' @entity10 , the former chief of the @entity11 , said anything that would n't be able to harm an aircraft 's functionality should be allowed on board			1
' in retrospect , i should have done the same thing , ' @entity10 told @entity19 of the rule , which has caused widespread confusion and outrage , especially among the families of victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks			1
' @entity49 , machetes ... bring anything you want that is pointy and sharp because while you may be able to commit an act of violence , you will not be able to take over the plane			2
it is as simple as that			2
' @entity10 added , ' so my position would be , bravo on the 2.6 inch knife			2
but why not take it all the way and then really clean up the checkpoint where officers are focusing on bombs and toxins , which are things that can destroy an airplane			0
and it would smooth the process , cost less money , and be better security			0
' the @entity11 's announcement of the new policy has upset many families who lost loved ones in the 9/11 terror attacks			1
' i 'm really horrified and i would say the majority of 9/11 family members are really shocked by it , ' said @entity81 , the mother of firefighter @entity82 who died trying to save people in the @entity84			1
the @entity11 said effective april 25 , it would allow small knives with blades that are 2.36 inches or less in length and less than 1/2 inch wide			1
explaining why axes and machetes would n't do harm on an airplane , @entity10 said , ' what are you going to do when you get on board with a battle ax ? are you pull out your battle ax and say , " i 'm taking over the airplane ? " you may be able to cut one or two people , but pretty soon you would be down in the aisle and the battle ax would be used on you			0
' tragic : @entity81 stand at a september 11 @entity101 event with a picture of her firefighter son @entity103			0
she is one of the many family members of victims who is outraged at the new @entity11 changes he added , ' you can commit acts of violence on an aircraft with what is allowed now			1
with a @entity117 can , a key , a ruler , and some duct tape , you can make a 12 - inch razor - sharp sword			0
and every eighth - grader would be able to do that			0
' ms @entity81 told @entity121 about a recent flight she took to @entity123 where the security screener stopped her because she had a small container of yogurt onto a flight			1
' yogurt 's more dangerous than a pen knife and a golf club ! ' she said			0
' i am vehemently against anyone bringing a pen knife			0
i do n't think there is another 9/11 family who does n't get on a plane with a lot of trepidation and fear			1
' i always think of 9/11			2
i always think " is there someone on here who is going to be here who is going to be a terrorist ? " ' another relative , @entity145 , says small pocketknives can be just as lethal as the box cutters that are still banned			2
ms @entity145 's brother was the pilot of the hijacked plane that crashed into the @entity150 on september 11 , 2001			0
the hijackers wielded box cutters			0
the families of victims are not the only ones who are upset : the former colleagues of victims are as well			2
specific : the @entity11 says that the changes reflect the findings of their recent review of security measures exemptions : only certain bats are allowed but many think it is premature to allow any at all the @entity168 ' categorically rejects a proposal to allow knives of any kind in the cabin , ' and they do n't understand why ' such a momentous decision ' was made without any consultation			1
as for some of the larger items that they will now allow , like the sports equipment , increases ' the potential for passengers getting hit with these items during boarding and deplaning			0
it 's a recipe for disaster , ' said the @entity185 representative			0
' this is part of an overall risk - based security approach , which allows transportation security officers to better focus their efforts on finding higher - threat items such as explosives , ' he said			0
@entity10 said he understands and respects their opposition , ' but from a security strategy point of view this is absolutely the right decision			2
' ' the air marshals and the flight attendants have legitimate concerns , certainly , for their own safety , but the threat of taking over a plane with a small , sharp instrument is zero , ' @entity10 said			2
' you can not necessarily prevent violence on an airplane , but that is not the @entity11 's mission			1
@entity11 's mission is to prevent a successful , catastrophic terrorist attack , and you can not get a successful , catastrophic terrorist attack with a small knife or a wiffle ball bat			1
' travelers will now be allowed to bring golf clubs , ski poles and even small knives on planes with them since aviation officials have announced significant security changes			1
other items that will be allowed on board again as part of a passenger 's carry - on luggage include billiard cues , ski poles , hockey sticks and lacrosse sticks			0
items that had been prohibited like razors , box cutters or knives with a fixed blade are still not allowed on board			2
the restrictions about liquids are still in place as well , meaning that anything under 3 - ounces must be declared at the security checkpoint			0
loosening the reins : @entity11 officials have changed their stance on certain banned objects which will now be allowed on planes starting on april 25 no longer a threat ? billiard cues and lacrosse sticks will be allowed on board now the @entity249 , which represents nearly 90,000 flight attendants from carriers across the country , called the decision a ' poor and shortsighted decision ' by the @entity11			1
' as the last line of defense in the cabin and key aviation partners , we believe that these proposed changes will further endanger the lives of all flight attendants and the passengers we work so hard to keep safe and secure , ' the coalition said in a statement			0
@entity11 spokesman @entity266 said the decision was made to bring @entity269 regulations more in line with @entity272 standards and would also help provide a better experience for travelers			1
@entity266 said the @entity11 has implemented a number of safety measures including reinforced cockpit doors , allowing some pilots to be armed and federal air marshals on board airplanes			1
he said those measures would help ensure safety of the passengers and crew			0

@entity11 announced a new policy this week to allow small knives onto commercial planes starting in april
parents of 9/11 victims say they are outraged by the new policy
the @entity168 *blasted* ' poor and shortsighted decision '
