@entity0 say they are going ahead with preparations to race in @entity3 this weekend despite bailiffs seizing items from their factory in on wednesday			1
the troubled team issued a statement ahead of the race at @entity10 that condemned ' unfounded and unsubstantiated rumours concerning actions against @entity13 , the entrant and owner of @entity16 '			2
' an action was threatened yesterday against a supplier company to @entity19			0
this company is not owned by @entity13 and it has no influence over the entry of @entity16 or the entrant , ' it added			0
@entity0 will race at the @entity3 gp this weekend despite having baliffs visit their factory on wednesday ' contrary to uncontrolled rumours , all operations are currently in place at @entity30 and the race team is doing its preparation in @entity3			1
' a senior source close to the team confirmed that bailiffs had visited the @entity30 factory but said it was not the first time and denied reports that the facility or computer servers had been closed down			2
' all this nonsense is nothing to do with the @entity46 team ... it is 100 percent not related to the @entity48 team or any company or subsidiary of the @entity48 team , ' added the source , who did not want to be identified			2
a list of seized items to be sold at a public auction , likely in mid-october , appeared later on the bailiffs ' website www.thesheriffsoffice.com			1
they included a 2013 @entity48 ' test car ' , steering wheels , drilling and machining equipment , wheels and assorted pit lane items such as jacks and starters			1
car parts ' due for @entity3 2014 ' were also listed , although the race cars and main items of freight would normally have arrived in @entity3 some time ago with teams already setting up their garages in the paddock on wednesday			1
@entity0 's decision to compete at @entity10 means home favourite @entity76 will get to race @entity0 changed ownership in july when @entity81 entrepreneur @entity80 sold the struggling team to an unidentified ' consortium of @entity86 and @entity85 investors '			1
since then the new owners have been embroiled in legal action with some 40 former employees who accuse them of unfair dismissal			0
there have also been issues to resolve with suppliers			0
@entity0 , who are last in the championship standings and have never scored a point , said in a statement in july that the staff in question were employed by a supplier rather than the @entity46 team itself			1
the team 's @entity30 site was previously used by @entity103 and @entity104 , two now - defunct teams that collapsed due to financial problems			0
@entity0 are bottom in the @entity48 constructors championship standings with zero points @entity3 's @entity76 and @entity110 's @entity109 are @entity0 's current drivers , with @entity113 @entity112 due to take part in friday first practice at @entity10			1
team principal @entity116 had been quoted only this week as saying @entity0 planned to take a new front wing to @entity10 that they hoped would make their cars far more competitive			2
he also told @entity121 that work on the 2015 car was proceeding in the @entity124 wind tunnel in @entity125 , despite the team having to contend with ' surprises ' inherited from the previous ownership			0
' in this team , the surprises never end , ' he said			0
' if we keep having 10 surprises per day then we have to keep doing 10 miracles per day			0
so my concern is what happens when we run out of miracles			0
