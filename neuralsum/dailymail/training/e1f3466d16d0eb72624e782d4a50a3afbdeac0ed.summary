@entity1 have won six successive games whilst producing some awfully mediocre football , some of it downright shambolic			1
normally you get what deserve but @entity9 ’s team have been getting away with a little more than that of late			0
against @entity12 , reality returned			2
@entity1 were decidedly average in the first half and a little better in the second but they were n’t good enough to break down ten men			2
any committed @entity16 team with a well - executed game plan is a test for @entity1 at present and so it proved			2

@entity93 would come off the bench later			0
in fact @entity1 could field such an array of attacking players they could even afford to put @entity68 in midfield			2
but still they could not overwhelm @entity12 , nor , in that lame first - half , could they register a significant shot on goal			1
@entity103 at least does not hide behind blandness			0
‘ when you want to be a part of the title race then you have to win these games , ’ he said			0
‘ we dropped two points			0
we were the better team and that ’s frustrating when you do n’t win these games			0
we were not so aggressive in the first half as usual			0
we kept the ball much better but we did n’t create so much because we were not looking to the forwards ‘ we were not creative enough in the second half ; we did n’t keep the ball as well as in the first half but we had more aggression , so that was the plus			0
ok we have a draw but that ’s why i ’m a little bit frustrated because we could have won this game , we did n’t do it and we are responsible			0
’ @entity12 were so well set up by @entity125 , so clear in their intent and decisive in their tactics , that there was never a question of being swept aside			2
even when they controversially lost @entity54 to a red card on 65 minutes , there was no capitulation			1
throughout the team there were excellent performances			0
@entity53 and @entity48 shone , as did @entity54 until his early departure			1
@entity44 was the mainstay of @entity9 ’s back three at the @entity137 in the summer ; he put the experience to good use on saturday , frustrating his former national team boss at the heart of @entity12 ’s own three - man defence			2
@entity22 started up front for @entity1 in saturday afternoon 's @entity16 trip to @entity84 - his first start since early october the @entity147 international ( bottom ) was soon in the thick of the action as he slide tackles @entity12 defender @entity43 @entity43 ( left ) tries to fend off @entity1 captain @entity68 as they both compete for possession of the football @entity92 ( centre right ) fails to connect with a golden opportunity that could have given @entity1 the lead in the opening minutes @entity12 striker @entity53 gave his side the lead with a stunning left - footed strike on 18 minutes @entity53 ( far right ) chest controlled the ball before spinning to fire curl a shot despite the efforts of @entity1 's @entity64 ( centre right ) the @entity164 international 's shot was too good for @entity1 's in - form keeper @entity165 ( second right ) who was left rooted to the spot @entity53 ( second left ) is mobbed by his @entity12 team - mates after giving them the lead against @entity1 @entity125 had chosen to ape van @entity9 ’s formation to counter @entity1 and @entity44 stood out , cajoling , organising and intercepting as @entity1 were kept at bay in those opening exchanges			1
@entity103 ’s team kept the ball nicely in periods ; they rarely did anything with it			0
‘ i thought we were excellent considering everything that ’s been against us this week , ’ said @entity125			0
‘ we had seven lads out due to injury and suspension			0
our bench was like a kindergarten but the performance was absolutely terrific			0
’ indeed @entity125 ’s players executed instructions perfectly , swamping @entity1 ’s attacks leaving @entity54 as the man with the speed to transform their defensive moments into swift counter attacks			1
that said , for @entity12 ’s opener on 18 minutes though @entity1 had plenty of time to defend ; they just failed to do so			1
@entity48 floated in a delightful free kick and @entity53 took it down superbly , though @entity64 was weak challenging and closing down			2
it would be churlish to dwell on the negatives ; having found his half yard of space benteke curled the ball around @entity64 , finding a gap at the far post in which to squeeze the ball , leaving @entity165 helpless			0
‘ an absolute world class goal , ’ said @entity125			0
@entity1 playmaker @entity69 ( right ) is tackled by @entity12 captain @entity44 during their @entity16 encounter the hosts were reduced to 10 men halfway through the second half when @entity54 ( right ) was shown a straight red card @entity12 players vent their fury at referee @entity79 's decision as @entity26 ( second right ) lies in a heap following @entity217 's tackle half - time saw @entity67 sacrificed for @entity219 so @entity63 could push on in midfield ; @entity1 desperately needed some passing guile in that area			1
yet it was @entity12 who made the more immediate impression , @entity61 required to be at his superb best to tip over a firm @entity53 header from a corner on 48 minutes			1
@entity1 did ultimately demonstrate significantly more intent in the second half			2
@entity32 had to push away a close - range @entity92 shot on 51 minutes and then , on 54 minutes , came @entity22 ’s moment			1
@entity26 was now making a habit of getting past @entity46 and did so again sending in an excellent cross which @entity22 , leaning backwards , met firmly and decisively to equalise			1
scored by a @entity235 , it was the most @entity236 of goals and @entity22 greeted his second goal for the club rapturously , charging towards the @entity1 fans and sparking a mini pitch invasion			1
‘ it was a beautiful goal and i liked him today and i ’m very happy for him , ’ said @entity9 , while offering no clues as to whether he would keep his place			0
@entity12 though were not immediately cowed			2
indeed , their biggest setback came on 65 minutes when @entity26 and @entity54 clashed for the ball			1
@entity26 won it while @entity54 was late and came through the man but not with his foot raised			1
both players had attacked the ball aggressively but only referee @entity79 saw it as a red card			1
‘ if that s a red card we may as well just pack up as it wo n’t be a game of football ’ said @entity125			1
‘ yet @entity12 did not fold and @entity1 are still not what they were			1
@entity12 changed their shape to accommodate and they kept @entity1 at bay			1
indeed , on 87 minutes , a dipping , swerving shot from substitute @entity52 might have won them the game			2
and in the dying seconds , @entity263 was inches away from turning in a cross			0
it was not to be			0
but a point with ten men felt almost as good			0
@entity26 ( left ) was booed by many of the @entity12 supporters who have n't forgiven him since he left for @entity1 in 2011 @entity1 substitute @entity66 ( left ) battles for the ball against @entity12 defender @entity45 @entity61 watches on as @entity273 's dipping volley whistles just over his crossbar in the closing moments of the match			1

@entity53 gave @entity12 the lead on 18 minutes with a left - footed shot
@entity22 headed home @entity1 's equaliser shortly after half - time from an @entity26 cross
@entity12 's @entity54 was shown a straight red card midway through the second half after *fouling* @entity26
