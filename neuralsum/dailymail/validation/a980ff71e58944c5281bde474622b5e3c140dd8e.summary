spacewalking astronauts ventured out for the third time in just over a week on sunday to complete a tricky cable job at the @entity3 in one stunning shot , @entity4 revealed the enormity of the station against the darkness of space as his fellow astronaut , @entity10 , floated almost unseen			1
' can you spot the space walker in this picture ? ' @entity4 tweeted			1
' he 's very small compared to the enormous starboard truss of the @entity15 '			1
' can you spot the space walker in this picture ? ' @entity4 tweeted			1
' he 's very small compared to the enormous starboard truss of the @entity15 ' @entity25 also posted a space selfie and commented : ' @entity28 - three # spacewalks , 800 ' of cable , four antennas , three laser reflectors , one greased robotic arm			1
' but not everything went to plan			0
dramatically , right before sunday 's spacewalk , engineers spotted problems with @entity39 astronaut @entity10 's suit			1
while it had functioned perfectly during the first two spacewalks , on sunday morning , a pressure sensor briefly malfunctioned before he floated out			2
a mechanical gauge , however , was operating fine			1
@entity44 told @entity10 that he would need to pay extra attention to how his suit was feeling throughout the seven - hour excursion			2

the astronauts completed installing 400 feet of cable and several antennas associated with the @entity55 system known as @entity56 @entity4 took a space selfie , moments after completing the job			1
he wrote on @entity60 : ' @entity28 - three # spacewalks , 800 ' of cable , four antennas , three laser reflectors , one greased robotic arm ' the beautiful shot was taken on sunday during a spacewalk in which astronaut 's laid cables in preparation for future space taxis on the @entity3 @entity4 wrote : ' the camera does n't do it justice - floating in space , looking down on creation , seeing new colour shades ' meanwhile , @entity76 said a small amount of water got into @entity39 astronaut @entity4 helmet once he was back in the air lock and the chamber was being repressurised on wednesday			1
they were forced to spend two days analysing his suit after the water leak occurred at the end of an outing earlier this week			0
engineers concluded it was the result of condensation , and a safe and well understood circumstance that had occurred several times before with the same spacesuit			2
@entity4 was never in danger , according to @entity76 , so they cleared his spacesuit for the last of three spacewalks , friday , to install cable			1
but in 2013 , another astronaut nearly drowned because of a flooded helmet			0
@entity99 astronaut , @entity98 , barely got back into the space station after a considerable amount of water filled his helmet during a spacewalk			1
the water escaped from his suit 's cooling system and @entity76 spent months investigating the mishap , before clearing the way for more spacewalks			0
on wednesday , the amount of water seepage in @entity25 ' helmet was significantly smaller and occurred at the end of the spacewalk when @entity4 was already inside			1
' they 're very different occurrences , ' said @entity117 , a spacewalk officer in @entity44			0
the advance work , involving nearly 800 feet of cable over three spacewalks was carried out to create new crew capsules commissioned by @entity76			0
the work , done by @entity39 astronauts @entity25 and @entity124 , meant 400 more feet of power and data cable has been installed , as well as two antennas installed on sunday			1
a pair of docking ports will fly up later this year , followed by the capsules themselves , with astronauts aboard , in 2017			0
@entity4 ( right ) is seen during the third spacewalk outside the @entity3 sunday during the six hour , 45 minute outing , in which he helped set up antennas and communications equipment			1
the left image shows @entity10 fixing cables @entity4 wrote on this image : ' out on the @entity140 truss			1

@entity76 has n't conducted such a quick succession of spacewalks since its former shuttle days , and the amount of cable work is unprecedented construction of the @entity3 began on 20 november 1998			1
it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three			0
the station orbits at a height of about 255 miles ( 410km )			0
it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds ( 450,000kg ) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five - bedroom house			0
it completes an orbit of @entity171 every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles ( 27,600km ) per hour			0
it has now been in space for more than 5,900 days , during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of @entity171 , and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years			2
the astronauts successfully routed 364 feet on their first two excursions , on february 21 and last wednesday			0
they carried out complicated work sunday , yet the astronauts completed their task an hour early making it a five and a half - hour spacewalk			2
they spent 20 hours altogether on three outings			0
neither @entity25 nor @entity10 experienced any more suit trouble during their task			2
@entity44 joked by radio : ' you guys have done an outstanding job even for two shuttle pilots			0
' the 260 - mile ( 418 - kilometre ) spacewalk unfolded 50 years to the month of the world 's first spacewalk by @entity192 cosmonaut @entity191 on march 18 , 1965			2
@entity76 has n't conducted such a quick succession of spacewalks since its former shuttle days , and the amount of cable work is unprecedented			0
even more spacewalks will be needed once new docking ports start arriving in june			0
@entity10 is due to return to @entity171 next week following a five and a half - month mission			2
@entity25 is midway through his expedition			0
a @entity203 soyuz spacecraft carried them both up , with @entity76 paying for the multimillion dollar tickets			0
to save money and stop being so reliant on the @entity206 , @entity76 has hired @entity207 and @entity208 to develop spacecraft capable of transporting astronauts to the space station			2
the two contracts are worth nearly $ 7 billion			0
@entity208 already is delivering cargo under a separate agreement with @entity76			0
an astronaut is pictured at the @entity3 , the spacewalk is the third in eight days for @entity76 , and is the 187th in the history of the space station a space selfie taken during an earlier spacewalk on february 25th			1
@entity76 said a small amount of water got into @entity39 astronaut @entity4 helmet once he was back in the air lock and the chamber was being repressurised @entity4 gesturing a @entity228 hand salute from orbit as a tribute to @entity39 actor @entity231 , in space , 27 february 2015			1
@entity231 , 83 , who died on 27 february 2015 , played science officer @entity233 in the @entity235 series that served as an inspiration to generations of scientists in this image from @entity76 television astronaut @entity4 exits the quest airlock hatch beginning the third spacewalk outside the @entity3 early sunday morning march 1 , 2015			1
