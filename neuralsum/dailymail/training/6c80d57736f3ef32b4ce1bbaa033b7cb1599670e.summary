by @entity0 a musician who was hypnotised sang as a tumour was removed from her throat so surgeons could make sure they did n't damage her vocal cords			1
@entity6 , a married mother - of - one , had the operation while listening to a hypnotist at the @entity11 hospital in @entity12 near @entity13			1
@entity14 , head of anaesthesia and intensive care departments , carried out the delicate operation in april			1
one small slip of his scalpel could have destroyed miss @entity21 's voice forever			2
she then went into a trance and imagined she had travelled to @entity30 while surgeons removed the tumour @entity6 had the operation while listening to a hypnotist at the @entity11 hospital in @entity12 near @entity13 ms @entity21 had a parathyroid gland tumour but feared having it removed in case she lost her voice			1
according to mr @entity14 , the only way of knowing if her vocal chords had been protected was to get miss @entity21 to sing during the procedure			1
she sang two songs from her album @entity46 which is about modern @entity30 society and to - long which means ' fight and get what you want '			2
ms @entity21 , originally from @entity26 , was first given a local anesthetic and then hypnotised by @entity28			1
she then went into a trance and imagined she had travelled to @entity30			0
' because she was singing during the crictical moments , we could be sure that the operation was going well ' , said professor @entity14			2
ms @entity21 had a parathyroid gland tumour but feared having it removed in case she lost her voice ms @entity21 , who now lives on the outskirts of @entity13 , said the experience is difficult to explain			1
she said : ' there was a woman next to me who said , do n't worry everything will be fine			0
' she asked me to go on a journey and i said okay and she said i was going to @entity69			0
' it 's as though i was not in the operating theatre at all , i was far away in @entity69			0
' despite the hypnosis , ms @entity21 said she did feel pain at one point during the operation but when the hypnotist told her it would go , it did			1
according to @entity80 , ms @entity21 has now made a full recovery and hopes to produce a record in @entity83			1
the parathyroid glands are four tiny glands , located in the neck , that control the body 's calcium levels			0
each gland is about the size of a grain of rice			0
normal parathyroid glands work like the thermostat in your home to keep blood calcium levels in a very tightly controlled range			0
when the blood calcium level is too low , @entity99 is released to bring the calcium level back up to normal			0
when the calcium level is normal or gets a little too high , normal parathyroids will stop releasing @entity99			0
proper calcium balance is crucial to the normal functioning of the heart , nervous system , kidneys , and bones			0
however , the area where they are found at the base of the neck is tricky to operate on because they are close to blood vessels and nerves			2
one slip and the vocal cord can be permanently paralysed leaving the patient with a husky voice .			2
