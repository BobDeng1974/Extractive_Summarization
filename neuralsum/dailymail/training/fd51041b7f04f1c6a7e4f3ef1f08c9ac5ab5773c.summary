by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 18:59 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 02:12 est , 9 august 2013 the minister in charge of immigration claimed yesterday that border officials are simply too busy to take the fingerprints of people who try to sneak into the @entity8 illegally			2
@entity9 was responding to one of the key criticisms in a damning report by chief inspector of borders and immigration @entity15			1
the @entity17 was accused of an ‘ immigration cover - up ’ after 15 passages in the study into border controls in @entity22 were blacked out for security reasons			1
admission : immigration minister @entity9 said border staff are too busy to check fingerprints one of the sections which survived criticised border staff for failing to take fingerprints from all those caught trying to enter @entity8 from @entity31			1
speaking on the @entity32 radio 4 today programme , mr @entity9 acknowledged it was useful to take fingerprints before people are handed over to the @entity31 authorities , but claimed officers have to strike a balance with carrying out other tasks			1
‘ it would be useful but equally it consumes a large amount of time for our officers to do that when they could be using that time to carry out other tasks to secure the border and it ’s a balance , and the decision that was taken in 2010 was to work very closely with our @entity31 colleagues for them to process people trying to enter the @entity8 illegally , ’ he said			1
‘ but as i ’ve said we ’ve accepted that it would be appropriate to review our approach and that review will be completed by the end of the year			0
’ @entity56 : the chief inspector of borders and immigration @entity15 wrote a damning report on @entity8 's border controls responding to criticism over the redacted parts of the report , the minister said home secretary @entity66 uses her power to redact reports in the name of national security ‘ sparingly ’			1
‘ i think if you look at the history of the reports that the chief inspector ’s produced i think it would be fair to say that a number of them have previously been very critical for example of the @entity78 , in some cases very critical , ’ he said			0
‘ in those cases the home secretary has not used her powers to redact any of those reports			0
’ a spokesman for @entity83 , a group that campaigns for more controls on immigration , said : ‘ security concerns may have led to some of the redactions in the report but it is difficult to see this as the reason for all of them			1
‘ transparency has to be the best policy , if only to show that the @entity17 has nothing to hide			1
’ report author mr @entity15 criticised the fact that immigration officials were not fingerprinting people found trying to enter the @entity8 illegally , while biometric data was being taken from legitimate passengers			2
‘ i was surprised to find it was n’t being done - it had ceased to happen at @entity22 from the beginning of 2010 , ’ he said			0
‘ they have 100 per cent checking for legitimate passengers			0
it seems anomalous that people who are trying to enter the country illegally in this way , we have no record of their identity , nor do we take in their fingerprints			0
’ he refused to criticise mrs may for redacting parts of his report			2
‘ the home secretary has power under the @entity120 section 50 , subsection 3 , to redact any part of my report on grounds of national security , ’ he said			2
‘ what i concentrate on doing is producing a thorough evidence - based report to her , and then she will take advice on matters such as this			0
it ’s entirely her prerogative to do that , and in this case she ’s chosen to exercise that prerogative			0
