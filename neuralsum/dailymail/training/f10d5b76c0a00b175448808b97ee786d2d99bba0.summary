scientists have recreated ancient brain surgery to understand the remarkable medical techniques that existed almost 2,500 years ago			1
a team of experts in @entity5 has spent the past year examining skulls found with intricate surgical holes in a bid to fathom out how early nomadic doctors carried out their work			1
evidence had suggested they were among the earliest ever examples of trepanation - the oldest form of known neurosurgery - with the procedures clearly skilfully carried out			1
scientists have recreated ancient brain surgery on a modern skull ( shown ) to understand the remarkable medical techniques that existed almost 2,500 years ago			1
a team of experts in @entity5 has spent the past year examining skulls found with intricate surgical holes in a bid to fathom out how early nomadic doctors worked now @entity22 has reported that leading @entity5 doctor @entity23 carried out pioneering ' surgery ' on a modern skull using only the equipment available to ancient doctors working before @entity28 was born			1
the procedure was undertaken according to ancient methods used in the @entity31 on the skull of a woman who had died of natural causes shortly before			1
among the remarkable findings made by the @entity36 in @entity37 was the revelation that surgeons almost 2,500 years ago were highly skilled - perhaps even more so than many @entity40 doctors up until the 19th century			1
@entity41 involves the removal of a piece of bone from the skull , and it has been performed since prehistoric times			0
cave paintings indicate that people believed the practice would cure epileptic seizures , headaches and mental disorders			0
the oldest samples of skulls with bore holes drilled into them were found in a burial site in @entity57 dating back to 6500 bc. but it was also used by the @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and the early @entity65 civilizations			1
even the ' father of medicine ' hippocrates advocated the process in his 400 @entity71 tome ' on @entity72 '			0
modern exponents say it increases blood flow in the brain , increasing lucidity and heightening brain function			2
professor @entity23 , a prominent @entity79 neurosurgeon , who examined the ancient skulls and conducted the trepanation technique , said : ' honestly , i am amazed			2
' we suspect now that in the time of @entity67 , the @entity31 people could do a very fine diagnosis and carry out skilful trepanations and fantastic brain surgery			1
' the most exciting part of the research was recreating the surgical procedure itself , including trying to use similar instruments to those from the time			0
analysis of the skulls of ancient patients found that the operations were carried out with only one tool , a bronze knife , with the surgeons carefully scraping at the skull , yet leaving behind only minimal traces of their work			1
a replica was made using modern elements by archaeologist @entity108 , a doctor of historical sciences at the institute			2
he said : ' i chose a brass alloy of copper , tin , and zinc			0
our modern copy of brass alloy performed very well			0
' i think it is important to remember that @entity31 was a big centre for bone cutting production in the 5th century @entity71 ' people here were very skilful in making different objects from animal bone			0
' working with the animal bones , they understood the main principles of working with such material and later it helped them to make such complicated surgeries			0
' evidence from the ancient skulls ( one shown ) had suggested they were among the earliest ever examples of trepanation - the oldest form of known neurosurgery - with the procedures clearly skilfully carried out the @entity22 has reported that leading @entity5 doctor @entity23 ( left ) carried out pioneering ' surgery ' on a modern skull using only the equipment available to ancient doctors ( right ) working before @entity28 was born - which mostly consisted of knives and a saw the procedure was undertaken according to ancient methods used in the @entity31 on the skull of a woman who had died of natural causes short analysis of the skulls of ancient patients found that the operations were carried out with only one tool , a bronze knife , with the surgeons carefully scraping at the skull , yet leaving behind only minimal traces of their work professor @entity23 took exactly 28 minutes to recreate the surgical procedure on the modern skull			1
he said it ' required considerable effort ' , but in the end the hole in the skull was found to mirror those found in three ancient skulls examined by researchers			1
some ancient patients , who came from the @entity31 region , survived the procedures and went on to live long lives , archeologists have established			0
in addition , it was clear the ancient doctors somehow adhered to the strict @entity181 , the landmark declaration of medical ethics set down in @entity183 in @entity184			1
ancient skulls belonging to two men and a woman and dating back between 2,500 and 2,300 years , were found in the @entity31 with signs of having had brain surgery carried out			1
one of the males , aged between 40 and 45 , had suffered a head trauma and developed a blood clot that likely left him suffering headaches , nausea , and movement problems , experts believe			0
@entity41 would have been carried out to remove the haematoma , with evidence of later bone growth indicating the man survived the surgery and lived for years afterwards			2
the second man had no visible traces of trauma but instead was suspected of having a congenital skull deformation that the ancient surgeon wanted to fix			2
in both cases , a relatively small hole was made in the skull allowing surgeons to access the brain at an area where damage to joints and the membrane would have been minimised			2
and while the actual technique and the implements used may have varied from those recommended in @entity183 , it was clear the care for the patient and the location of the hole showed a similar ethnical consideration			0
holes were cut in modern skulls according to the ancient method			1
professor @entity23 took exactly 28 minutes to recreate the surgical procedure on the modern skull he said it ' required considerable effort ' using a knife to make the holes , but in the end the hole in the skull was found to mirror those found in three ancient skulls examined by researchers in order to study the procedure in detail , the remains were first analysed under a microscope at the @entity36 and @entity246 to find any markings that indicated the way the surgeons operated			1
no trace of the way the doctors removed the skin was found , and given the good preservation of the skull surface it is assumed this was carried out with high precision			1
the trepanation was conducted in two stages			0
first , a sharp cutting tool removed the surface layer of bone carefully without perforating the skull itself			2
then , with short and frequent movements a hole was cut			0
professor @entity23 said : ' all three trepanations were performed by scraping			0
' from the traces on the surface of the studied skulls , you can see the sequence of actions of the surgeons during the operations			0
' it is clearly seen that the ancient surgeons were very exact and confident in their moves , with no traces of unintentionally chips , which are quite natural when cutting bone			2
' where the nomadic surgeons learned their skill is still unknown			0
there are theories that they picked up the techniques from the medical centres of the ancient world , but others say they simply discovered them at the same time as prominent doctors in @entity183 and the @entity295			0
there is also no answer to how the doctors anaesthetised their patients before carrying out the procedures in the first place .			0

a @entity5 doctor has carried out ancient ' brain surgery ' on a modern skull
he attempted to recreate the methods of trepanation - one of the oldest known forms of neurosurgery - which involved cutting holes in skulls
he only used equipment that was available to doctors 2,500 years ago
analysis suggested that surgery was carried out knives and a saw
they found many ancient doctors must have been extremely skilled
