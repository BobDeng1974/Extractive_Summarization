by @entity0 when a bite on @entity4 's leg became black and swollen , her mother @entity1 assumed she was suffering from an allergic reaction			1
but the chain of events that followed led to three - year - old @entity4 being diagnosed with cancer			1
a worried ms @entity1 , 25 , took her daughter to the @entity11 after the mosquito bite she 'd received on holiday turned black			1
@entity4 , three , was diagnosed with leukaemia after a mosquito bite on her leg turned black it is thought @entity4 's bite ( pictured ) went black because the leukaemia had weakened her immune system she expected the doctor to prescribe antihistamines , but he became concerned by her condition and sent her to hospital for tests			1
as a result , she was diagnosed with the early stages of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( all )			1
her consultant , dr @entity29 , consultant paediatric haematologist at @entity30 explained : ' with @entity4 's type of leukaemia it is high risk and infections can also spread very quickly so the sooner diagnosis is made the better			2
' fortunately , because her cancer was diagnosed in the early stages , @entity4 's aggressive chemotherapy treatment was successful			1
just seven months after her diagnosis , the youngster , who is now four , is in remission and doctors expect her to be officially free from leukaemia by january 2016			2
after her diagnosis @entity4 quickly started a gruelling course of chemotherapy treatment @entity4 's mother , @entity1 , took her daughter to the gp thinking her daughter had had an allergic reaction to the bite			1
instead , the doctor referred @entity4 to hospital where she was diagnosed with cancer yesterday , her mother , a hairdresser from @entity54 , @entity55 , said : ' it was all very surreal - we just could n’t believe it			1
' when i noticed the bite on holiday in @entity62 last august i just thought it was a normal bite			2
' it was n’t until the next morning when i saw it go black that i thought it was n’t quite right			2
' the gp was brilliant because we were transferred to hospital very quickly where all the tests were done			1
' it turned out the bite had gone black because @entity4 had no immune system to fight it as her blood was so low from the cancer			1
@entity4 's cancer was caught early and she has responded well to treatment so doctors hope she will soon be free of the disease			1
she will continue to have regular check ups to check for relapses @entity4 's mother said : ' as soon as we heard the words " your daughter has cancer " our world stopped ' @entity4 ( pictured having tests in hospital ) should now be well enough to start school in september ' as soon as we heard the words " your daughter has cancer " our world stopped			1
' once the news had settled as much as it could it was time so start being positive for @entity4 ’s sake			0
you never ever think that this is ever going to happen to you or your child			0
' @entity4 started losing her hair but she has been so brave			0
i think we found it harder than her			0
she has been really cheerful through all of it			0
i am so proud of her			0
' hopefully now the treatments are going down to once a month it will be fine for @entity4 to go back to nursery and start school in september			0
' she added she still could n't believe @entity4 was diagnosed due to the bite			1
@entity4 ( pictured shortly after her birth ) will continue to have treatment until january 2016 @entity4 's parents are supporting @entity30 's £ 4 million @entity110 she said : ' hopefully she will pull through all because of the insect bite raising the alarm			2
' dr @entity29 , added : ' when @entity4 came into us she was pretty fit - even though she was lethargic - so we were able to start treatment straight away which obviously improved her chances			0
' she will continue to undergo treatment every month until january 2016 and then have regular check - ups to make sure the leukaemia has not returned			2
' @entity1 and @entity4 ’s dad @entity121 , 29 , are now backing the final stage of @entity30 ’s £ 4 million @entity110			2

@entity129 is cancer of the white blood cells			1

symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia include pale skin , tiredness , breathlessness and repeated infections			0
it affects about 650 people a year in the @entity146 and is the most common type of cancer in children			0
approximately one in every 2,000 children will develop it			0
about 85 per cent of cases occur in children under the age of 15			0
the outlook for children with the disease is usually good - almost all children will achieve a period of remission and 85 per cent will be completely cured			0
the outlook for adults with the disease is less good - only 40 per cent are completely cured			0

@entity168 was bitten by a mosquito and the bite turned black
it also swelled up so her mother thought she had had an allergic reaction
@entity1 took her daughter to the gp who sent her to hospital
she was quickly diagnosed with leukaemia and started chemotherapy
bite had turned black because the cancer meant her white blood cell count was low , so she could n't fight infection
has responded well to treatment and will hopefully soon be disease free
