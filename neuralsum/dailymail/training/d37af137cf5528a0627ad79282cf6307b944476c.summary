decision : the clinical drug watchdog @entity1 has put a ban a drug used to treat men with prostate cancer			1
@entity6 , a @entity6 mp , said the @entity7 must step in health ministers are being urged to stop a ban on one of the most popular drugs used to treat men with prostate cancer			1
the rationing watchdog @entity1 is poised to make a ‘ bizarre ’ decision that would needlessly condemn men to hair loss and other unpleasant side effects from chemotherapy , it is claimed			1
the drug abiraterone can give men with advanced prostate cancer months or even years of relief before they need chemotherapy , but @entity1 insists chemo must be used first			1
more than 3,000 men benefited from the drug last year via the @entity26 in @entity27 , special funding used for medication not approved for routine @entity31 use			2
it was the second most - requested treatment – around one in six total requests – and they were all for use prior to chemotherapy			0
@entity6 , a @entity6 mp , said the @entity7 must step in to halt the plan			1
the ex-minister of @entity37 in the @entity7 himself intervened when he was in charge two years ago after @entity1 threatened not to allow the drug to be used at all			1
as a result @entity1 did a u-turn and doctors were allowed to give the drug on the @entity31 after chemo			1
but advances mean it could now be used earlier in treatment with men having fewer side effects and improved quality of life before needing chemotherapy			0
the @entity53 and @entity54 ( @entity1 ) says the drug would not be cost - effective at this stage of treatment			1
mr @entity6 said ‘ the idea of restricting the drug so men have to have chemotherapy first , when their hair may fall out and they suffer other side effects , seems bizarre			2
‘ there is no reason why this drug could not be assessed in the same way as before , giving men added quality of life towards the end of their life			0
’ the drug abiraterone can give men with advanced prostate cancer months or even years of relief before they need chemotherapy			1

he has written to the current health minister @entity77 urging her to act as he did in 2012 to prevent the ban as there would be guarantee it would remain available to patients before chemo and some might not get it all			1
campaigners say the latest plan is stark evidence of the neglect of sufferers from a disease that strikes 40,000 @entity91 men each year			0
some @entity91 have survived on abiraterone for almost five years			2
the official price of a month ’s treatment is £ 3,000 but the @entity31 pays less through a discount scheme from manufacturer @entity96			0
@entity97 says the plan makes no sense as the drug is likely to be more effective before chemotherapy			0
@entity102 , also known as @entity102 , was developed by @entity91 scientists			0
professor @entity104 , deputy chief executive of @entity105 , @entity106 , where the drug was developed , said : ‘ @entity102 is now used as standard after chemotherapy and has extended the lives of thousands of men in the @entity91 with advanced prostate cancer , with fewer side - effects than chemotherapy			1
‘ the decision to refuse use of abiraterone before chemotherapy will deny many thousands of men the opportunity to access the drug earlier in their course of treatment			2
’ @entity122 , 61 , who lives with her 66 - year - old husband @entity123 in north - west @entity106 , says he was fortunate in getting the drug for eight months before he needed chemotherapy			0
she said ‘ it gave him a good quality of life with no side effects at all			0
it has given him further quality time with his family			0
‘ he experienced none of the weariness and fatigue that he had with other medications			0
‘ @entity102 allowed my husband to live an independent life and it delayed the use of doxetaxel chemotherapy			0
‘ once that failed , the tumour in his spine progressed and he is now confined to a wheelchair and also has the debilitating effects of the chemotherapy treatment			0
’ in 2012 , @entity1 attempted to ban the use of abiraterone altogether but was forced into a u-turn after a public outcry and a rare intervention from the @entity7			1
@entity152 , chief executive of @entity153 @entity91 said ‘ it is no secret that we think it deplorable that abiraterone pre-chemotherapy could be denied for use on the @entity31 in @entity27 and @entity159			0
‘ we know first hand from those who have been able to access abiraterone through the cancer drugs fund for use in this way , that it can offer a vital chance to delay chemotherapy and the debilitating side effects which can come with it			2
‘ we have urged @entity96 and @entity1 to work together to do everything in their power to make this vital treatment available as soon as possible for all who need it			2
we welcome any intervention which could lead to the right decision being made for men			2
’ a @entity7 spokesperson said ‘ @entity102 is already available through our @entity26 to prostate cancer patients			1

abiraterone can give prostate cancer sufferers years of relief before chemo
