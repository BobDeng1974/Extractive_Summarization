' it all came from watching a tv show about @entity40			1
she was crying all the way through it			0
sharing : the little girl has decided to give away some of her toys after being moved by the plight of children touched by cancer ' she could n't stand the idea that there are children out there who have lost a parent to cancer , or have do n't have food on the table			1
' she decided that seeing as it was her birthday coming up that she would give away all her presents			0
' initially i did n't think she was being serious but @entity22 was going on about it for days			0
' she was stuck on the idea that she wanted to do something to help so in the end i had to agree			0
' over time i guess she realised it 's just too much for any child , especially with her birthday and @entity76 just around the corner			2

' as a family we go to the salon to get our hair and nails done but there 's nothing wrong with that			1
we do shop at @entity139 and @entity140 as well			0
' i like to keep the kids looking nice			0
i am the world 's biggest critic when it comes to looks but i think that a well presented child is a confident child			2
' what with all the filming , she 's had a great time and a lot of special days out			2

raising money : the bespoke @entity18 will be auctioned off to raise funds for hugs for @entity165 , a charity set up to support four - year - old @entity167 who is fighting a rare form of cancer ' i think i can take some credit as a parent for the fact that she realised it was the right thing to do , i 'm quite chuffed really			1
' we 're not sure where the presents are going yet			0
@entity22 's only request is that they go towards making another child happy			0
' she thinks it 's really sad that some children do n't have food , or parents , and she wants to make them happy			1
' @entity12 says the bespoke @entity18 will probably be auctioned off to raise funds for hugs for @entity165 , a charity set up to support four - year - old @entity167 who is fighting a rare form of cancer			1
the rest of the gifts will either go to a charity shop or be sold off			0
@entity12 added : ' i do n't know why we are being featured in ' @entity103 ' - we 're just a normal family really			0
' maybe it 's because we lived in @entity117 , i do n't know			0
my children are just normal			0
' i think that any parent who has the means to supply for their children should be able to do so in whatever way they want			0
' i would never put real fur on a child or give them a @entity203 but i do like to treat them on their birthdays			0
' spoiling my children is done in moderation , just on birthdays and @entity76			0
i have been there when i ca n't afford presents and you do n't have a thing for the kids			0
' the year @entity22 was born i found myself out of work and we did all we could just to get the @entity76 dinner on the table and a couple of presents from @entity220			0
