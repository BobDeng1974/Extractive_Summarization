new polling numbers paint a dismal picture of the @entity3 presidency as the @entity4 gains influence in the @entity6 and threatens to mount an attack on the @entity9 homeland			1
just 42 per cent of @entity9 now see the president as a ' strong leader , ' according to an @entity14 / @entity13 poll released tuesday - despite bullish talk from the @entity16 that @entity3 will be able to carry out his strategy against @entity4 without asking @entity18			1
even as the @entity9 leader languished in the new poll - consistent with seven others asking @entity9 to rate the president 's performance			1
tanking : president @entity3 's rating as a ' strong leader ' is at an all - time low atas he prepares to outline a strategy to defeat the @entity4 terror network before it can mount an attack on @entity9 nearly two - thirds – 65 per cent – say the @entity9 should ramp up airstrikes against @entity4 and expand them into @entity32 , where the terror group has its largest strongholds and have so far been protected by a largely invisible national border			1
and 70 per cent think @entity4 is already positioned inside the @entity9 with the resources and ability to mount an attack			1
the development came as @entity3 prepared to deliver a prime - time address on wednesday outlining his plans for an expanded military and political effort to combat militants in @entity32 and @entity45			1
@entity3 is expected to urge @entity18 to quickly give him authority to arm moderate @entity32 opposition forces fighting president @entity48			1
but , though he will ask , administration officials say @entity3 will press forward with other elements of his plan even without @entity18 say - so			1
that could include further airstrikes against the @entity55 militants in @entity45 and possibly in @entity32			0
other elements of @entity3 's plan include increased support for @entity45 security forces , as well as military and diplomatic commitments from partners in @entity62 , the @entity6 and elsewhere			0
a whopping 54 per cent now say they disapprove of @entity3 's work in the @entity65 , according to the average published by @entity67			0
slightly more , 55 per cent , told @entity14 pollsters that @entity3 is not a strong leader			1
@entity71 's presidential approval average peaked at 65.5 per cent approval shortly after @entity3 's first inauguration in 2009 , and stood at 54 per cent after his second election – the same number who now say they disapprove			0
his current 42 per cent rating has been worse – notably after the disastrous launch of @entity80 – but @entity9 have never had a lower estimation of the president 's leadership strength			1
a separate poll released monday by @entity85 and @entity86 found that 71 percent of @entity9 think @entity4 terrorists are already positioned in the @entity9 with the resources they need to mount an attack			1
about 87 per cent said they were concerned about the threat @entity4 poses to @entity9 's national security			1
@entity3 is set to deliver a critical speech wednesday night at 9:00 p.m. eastern time , in which he 's expected to outline a comprehensive strategy to ' degrade and destroy ' the @entity98 group			0
observers in both @entity18 and the @entity16 expect that any effective plan will stretch well into the next presidency			2
house speaker @entity102 and other congressional leaders will meet with the president tuesday at 5:00 p.m. to hear a preview of the speech			0
' what i ’m hoping to hear from the president today is a strategy that goes after @entity4 , and destroys them , ' @entity102 said in a statement			2
' i ’ve been calling for a strategy to deal with the growing terrorist threat since january , when @entity4 came across the border in western @entity45			0
we have a very serious problem , and what we need is a strategy			0
... i am looking for a strategy from the president that takes on this terrorist threat and defeats it			0
' the president has been criticized for emphasizing political solutions – encouraging @entity45 to build an ' inclusive ' government that no longer marginalizes religious minority groups – instead of being more aggressive militarily			0
@entity6 or @entity128 ? a strong majority of @entity9 think @entity4 is already positioned in the @entity9 for attacks to be mounted later the @entity131 reported on monday that @entity132 has presided over 148 airstrikes against @entity4 in @entity45			2
but a @entity131 insider told @entity135 that more than 500 targets have been hit			0
still , @entity4 poses a continuing threat because it could retreat into @entity32 , and maintains its largest strongholds in the eastern part of that country			2
@entity3 is said to be weighing options to attack there , despite objections from @entity32 dictator @entity48			2
the @entity131 has already conducted numerous flyovers with surveillance drones to assess @entity4 's capabilities and identify potential airstrike targets			0
sen. @entity148 , an @entity150 @entity149 , said tuesday that ' as we wait for the president to outline his long overdue strategy , @entity4 is a growing danger to our national security , to our allies , and to innocent people across the @entity6			0
' any strategy @entity3 articulates is likely to lean heavily on the involvement of a coalition of nations , rather than engaging @entity4 alone			2
the @entity85 / @entity86 poll found that 61 per cent of @entity9 oppose sending @entity9 ground troops into @entity45 to fight @entity4			1
but 6 in 10 also said they would support new military action if other countries shared the burden .			0

nearly two - thirds , 65 per cent , support *bombing* @entity4 positions inside @entity32
