by @entity0 published : 05:08 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 06:38 est , 30 july 2013 when 20 - year - old @entity3 - @entity2 noticed she was suddenly gaining weight , she visited her doctor to see if anything was wrong			1
told it was ' just stress ' , @entity3 , who lives in @entity7 , was sent away			1
and she was repeatedly dispatched with the same diagnosis when she returned again and again over the next few months to ask what was happening to her body			0
it was not until march , when she had been in labour for four days , that it finally dawned on doctors and @entity3 herself that she was - despite taking the @entity16 religiously - pregnant			1
surprise , surprise : @entity3 - @entity2 and baby @entity19 on the day he was born , which was also the first time @entity3 realised she was pregnant ' i 'd been feeling incredibly sick since late june , which [ my partner @entity24 and i have ] worked out is most likely when we conceived , ' @entity3 told @entity26			1
' i went to my doctor multiple times and he just said it was stress			2
' towards the end , from around february , i started to fully feel kicking			0
i did n't know what that felt like , and i 'd heard from someone with @entity35 that she felt little bubble - like sensations all the time and her tummy felt hard because of that , so i brushed it off			1
' @entity3 continued : ' it started to really annoy me early march , so i got an emergency appointment at my doctor 's surgery			1
' the woman we saw did n't seem to want to help in any way at all			2
she told me that she could't do anything for me as emergency appointments were reserved for emergencies			0
she didn ' even offer me advice			0
' she felt my stomach , and said nothing			0
i heard from the midwives at the hospital that she 'd written in my notes that my stomach felt hard , but she did n't do anything about it , or even suggest the obvious - that i was pregnant - even though i 'd also complained of feeling pressure throughout my abdomen			1
' mother and son : @entity3 , 20 , says @entity19 , now four months , is the best thing that has ever happened to her and boyfriend @entity24 , 18 but the riddle was solved in march , when early one morning @entity3 found herself in agony , unable to sit , stand or lie down			1
' i was in early labour for a good couple of days , but i thought it was just period pain ! it got really bad the night before he was born - i could n’t sit or lay down , and standing up was agony too			1
' i only knew something was wrong when i felt the unbelievable urge to push , got to the bathroom and i started bleeding everywhere			0
' i phoned an ambulance at about 5:30am and when they got to our house they asked all sorts of questions about the pain , and told me i was most probably pregnant			0
' father and son : @entity24 , 18 , with his baby son @entity19 shortly after his birth - which came as a complete surprise to both his parents @entity3 and her boyfriend @entity24 , 18 , had been together for a year before having @entity19 , and had talked about having babies but decided to wait for a while since they were both still in college			1
but they did n't get to wait very long , as that night the pair of them were rushed to hospital , both in complete shock			2
' i literally did n't believe what they were saying			2
i was rushed into @entity104 at @entity105 and they asked me the questions again , and again told me i was more than likely pregnant			0
' i was in so much shock that regardless of how many times they said it , i did n't believe it			1
i was taken to another room where they took an ultrasound of my stomach , and it showed my baby was right down in the birth canal			0
' the surprised mother - to - be had been in labour for almost four days before she fully realised what was happening			2
they rushed her to princess anne maternity hospital where she gave birth naturally to her son about an hour later			0
hello , world : @entity19 , who was conceived despite his mother @entity3 being on @entity16 luckily , @entity3 is n't a big drinker and does n't smoke , so she was n't inadvertently harming her baby 's health while she was pregnant			1
' the most i did was drink @entity131 three times a week before a workout , ' she said			1
she and @entity24 had been dieting and working out together before the birth , which is partly why she returned again and again to her doctor when she was not losing but actually gaining weight			1
but since she was taking the @entity139 contraceptive pill she did not think the weight gain could possibly mean she was pregnant			1
' it upsets me a little that i did n't get to experience pregnancy like other women do , ' @entity3 said			1
' i did n’t have any scans or classes for what on earth to do when you ’re having a baby , but everyone around us always tells us how well we 're doing , and how well we 've coped with the shock			0
' initially when we found out that i was in labour , we were both incredibly scared and in shock , and really did n't know what to do			2
' but as soon as our son was born , it was the most intense feeling of love that we just looked at each other and knew what to do			0
' nothing else we 've ever done has felt so right , we love our son too much to explain , and could n't imagine life without him			0
we 're just so lucky to have him , we call him our little miracle			0
' happy family : @entity24 and @entity3 , pictured with baby @entity19 , are hoping to marry in april and expand their family as soon as possible but @entity3 and @entity24 are less enamoured with the way her doctors treated her			1
' i really am not impressed with my doctor			0
the fact that literally three days before i gave birth my tummy was felt and nothing was said is ridiculous			0
' she made such a massive error in judgement			0
it borders heavily on negligence			0
i have severe back pain , and have serious pain in my left hip as a result of a terrifying and agonising labour : i ca n't do anything anymore without being in huge amounts of pain			2
' despite this , the new parents think baby @entity19 , now four months old , is ' the single most amazing thing to happen ' in their lives			1
' we 're planning to get married in april , and hoping to try for another baby soon because we ’d love to expand our family			2
' let 's just hope the next one is n't so much of a surprise			0
our little miracle : next time she is pregnant , @entity3 would like the chance to experience it properly rather than having a surprise birth nine months later			2
