the animal got its head stuck in a tree in the middle of a field in @entity11 , @entity12 , yesterday afternoon			1
it took a team of six firefighters from @entity16 an hour - and - a - half to free the young bullock			1
trapped : the bullock with its head stuck in the tree in the field in @entity22			1
it later had to be rescued by the fire brigade using a specialist animal harness emergency workers initially tried to free the animal using strops but were forced to admit defeat and use a harness and a crane instead			1
pictures taken at the scene show the team of firemen gathering around the hapless cow with specialist animal rescue equipment			1
after being winched up and released from the tree , the animal was said to be distressed but uninjured and was later reunited with it 's herd in a nearby field			1
@entity43 , @entity22 station manager for @entity44 , said : ' it was a very strange incident indeed			0
rescue mission : five firefighters surround the bullock as it is fitted with the specialist harness and attacked to a crane			1
the bullock was later lifted up and released from the tree distressed but uninjured ' what he was looking for , i do n’t know and we do n’t know how long he was in there			1
manual lifting did n’t work because of the way his head was trapped			0
' it 's normal to cover animals ’ heads during rescues to keep them in the dark for as long as possible - because this helps them to stay calm			2
' but on this occasion , with the cow ’s head in the tree it was not really necessary			0
his head was in the bottom of the tree which was quite dark			0
' he was relatively calm while we were there			0
the cow ran off once we got him out – he did n’t stay around to thank us			0
he was bemused but appeared uninjured			0
' a spokesman for @entity44 added : ' on arrival the officer in charge assessed the situation and attempts were made initially to release the animal using strops and various equipment from the @entity22 appliance			2
' these attempts proved unsuccessful , so a specialist large animal harness , with a quick release mechanism , was used in conjunction with the @entity95 crane on the rescue tender			2
' the cow was successfully lifted up and released from the tree			0

the animal was rescued from a field in @entity11 in @entity12
it took a team of six firemen an hour - and - a - half to free the young bullock
