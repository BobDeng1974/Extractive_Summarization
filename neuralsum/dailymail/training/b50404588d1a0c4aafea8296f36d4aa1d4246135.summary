a row has broken out over school dinners after it emerged reception pupils were being given just one chicken nugget for their lunch			1
infant pupils around the country are all entitled to a free hot meal every lunchtime under the government 's flagship scheme brought in this month			1
but the quality of the food they are being given was called into question today when the measly meals being served up to the youngest pupils in @entity17 were revealed			1
' the rations and portions are not brilliant			0
in reception class , children get just one nugget , year 1 get two and @entity34 get three or four			1
' the whole point is to make sure that children get adequate meals with good nutrition			2
in one class i went to the children did n't get any fresh vegetables or fruit			0
i think we should insist that there is more training of staff			0
they need to know about sizes of rations			0
' deputy prime minister @entity52 launched plans to give all under - sevens a free meal at lunchtime and the scheme started in schools earlier this month			1
but the idea has already suffered setbacks after it emerged some schools had to bus in meals and others were providing cold food for pupils			1
@entity67 councillor @entity23 said she was ' seriously concerned ' by the size of the portions policy : @entity52 visited schools when he launched free hot dinners for all infant pupils earlier this year councillor @entity23 said council - owned food provider @entity75 - which is responsible for meals at 92 per cent of the city 's schools - was leaving youngsters short - changed			1
she added : ' it 's all very well just saying ' we have free school meals ' , but you have to be able to implement that policy			1
' the children obviously did n't just get the one chicken nugget , there was potato and vegetables on offer too , but i do n't know if they should be given this processed food at all			1
the @entity94 says boys aged 4 - 6 years need 1,715 calories a day and girls 1,545			2
a child 's lunch should contain a third of their daily calories			0
they need two servings of vegetables a day and two of fruit , four of bread , cereal or potatoes , three of milk and dairy and two of fish or meat			0
in basic terms , children of this age should be a getting a plate of food comprising half a plate of vegetables / fruit , a quarter of a plate of protein and a quarter of starchy food such as pasta for their lunch			2
' all the children are getting the same money per head so it 's a bit naughty of the company to give the reception class less			0
' others in the area pointed out that even if children were given more generous portion of nuggets , the food was unlikely to provide the nutrition children need			2
@entity143 's @entity142 said : ' these are processed foods			0
why are we not giving them fresh food ? ' @entity150 's children 's boss has admitted the situation is ' unacceptable ' and said bosses are investigating meals provided by @entity75			1
nutrition expert @entity154 said the vague advice schools are given for dinners alow them to serve up inadequate meals			2
she said : ' the way the guidelines are worded , children could potentially have two portions of fried food and two pastry based meals a week , which would be too much			1
' i do n't think we should just get rid of all the food children like because we have to be realistic , they just wo n't eat what is put in front of them if it 's really boring			2
' but with things like chicken nuggets , i do n't think they should have that kind of fried food more than once a week			0
' the new scheme came after a high - profile campaign by celebrity chef @entity180 the idea of free school meals for infant pupils was recommended in a review of school food by the @entity187 restaurant chain			1
their inquiry found that packed lunches are usually much less nutritious than cooked meals , and said a better diet would improve children 's performance in the classroom			0
deputy prime minister @entity52 launched the plan at last autumn 's @entity198 conference			0
the government has assigned £ 2.30 for each meal served to pupils and also says it is ploughing £ 150million into upgrading school kitchens			1
previously , only students with parents earning less than £ 16,000 were entitled to the food , but more than 1.5million children can now eat for free			2
but critics have said schools were given too little time and money to prepare for the changes			0
the @entity212 also wants the policy to be extended to all primary pupils			0
general secretary @entity215 says children ' do not stop being hungry at seven years of age ' .			0

all under - sevens given free school meal as part of new government plan
but it emerged that the youngest pupils in one city get just one nugget
six - year - olds get two of the *snacks* and seven - year - olds get four
*locals* have *slammed* both the size and the nutritional value of the meals
@entity150 says it is investigating *contractor* who provides the food
