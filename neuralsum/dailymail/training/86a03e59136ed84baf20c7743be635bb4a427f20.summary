by @entity0 last updated at 5:05 pm on 17th february 2012 a little girl bleeding from a head wound was turned away from a doctor 's surgery - because she was n't registered as a patient			1
four - year - old @entity6 suffered a serious cut on her head when she fell against a wall whilst running along a corridor at the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13			1
her parents @entity14 and @entity16 picked the youngster up , ran across the corridor to the @entity20 surgery - one of six gp surgeries within the centre - and begged the receptionist for help			1
turned away : four - year - old @entity6 suffered a serious cut on her head when she fell against a wall , but was sent away from the closest surgery but even though mr @entity16 , 25 , was registered as a patient there , they were turned away and told @entity6 had to be taken to her own doctor instead			1
the youngster was eventually treated at a neighbouring clinic , at which she was registered as a patient , just feet away in the same building where she was bandaged up			1
her parents then took her to @entity38 where her wound was stitched before taking her home , but she had to return the next day and was kept in overnight with suspected concussion			1
the family have since complained to the @entity20 surgery and have received a letter in return stating that the staff were following the centre 's existing protocol , but confirming that the practice will review how the event was dealt with in order to learn for the future and apologising for any stress and inconvenience caused			1
ms @entity14 , 24 , a nursery nurse , said : ' we find it disgusting that they could turn away anyone , let alone a child			0
all we wanted was basic first aid			0
' @entity6 's father , mr @entity16 , said : ' we put a complaint in to the surgery and they responded with a letter of apology saying they 'd followed protocol and this and that and the other			1
out of danger : @entity6 ( left ) pictured with her parents @entity16 and @entity14 , and brothers @entity75 ( centre ) and @entity77 ' we 're just in the process of responding and saying yes we accept your apology however we still do n't feel you followed protocol			1
' i would n't like it if i 'd fallen over and they 'd pushed me somewhere else but a child of three , as she was at the time , is terrible			0
' the couple , from @entity12 , @entity13 , had gone to the medical centre , which houses six gp surgeries around a common atrium , with @entity6 and their younger children , @entity92 , three , and @entity75 , one , to pick up a prescription from the pharmacy for @entity16 when the incident occurred on january 23			1
mr @entity16 , who works as a chef , said : ' we 'd gone into the doctors to get a repeat prescription and , going into the toilet , @entity6 had fallen over and bumped her head			1
' i picked her up and ran into the @entity101 and said can you help me ? ' @entity6 was bleeding quite heavily , she had blood all down her face , top and coat and i had blood all down me			2
' i was panicked , i was worried , shocked , everything just sort of set in			0
i just wanted her cleaned up to check out what was going on			0
' i just ran to the nearest doctor thinking obviously this is the place , they 'll help			0
i said can somebody help me and they said " is she registered here " and i said " no , but i am " but she [ the receptionist ] just said " well , you 'll have to take her to her own doctor "			2
recovery process : @entity6 pictured three days after the accident ( left ) and now ' i was just disgusted , i was speechless			2
it was just a case of the obvious place to get her sorted would be the doctors and it felt like they did n't want to help just because they were busy			0
' i ran out , her doctors is on the same floor and i ran there and said " can somebody help me ? "			0
they did n't ask if she was registered they just saw her and two nurses rushed in and started to bandage her up and help			2
' @entity6 was very upset , she was just crying more than anything else and i think she was in a bit of shock as well			2
' we went to the hospital to get her stitched up and brought her home and she stayed at home that night but was vomiting still the next day			2
so we phoned the hospital because she carried on being sick and they said if she 's sick more than three times to bring her in , so we did			2
' @entity6 was given an anti-sickness tablet but she threw it back up so she was given a cannula and an injection and kept in overnight for observation as doctors suspected she may have concussion			1
following protocol : the @entity6 family have received a letter from the @entity152 and @entity151 apologising ' if the parents felt the accident was dealt with inappropriately ' @entity16 said : ' she 's a lot better now , she 's still got a scar on her head but she 's back to her normal self , happy and chatty and into everything as they are at that age			1
' a spokeswoman from @entity152 and @entity151 , which runs the centre , said : ' we are very sorry to hear of the injuries the child sustained and would like to apologise if the parents felt the accident was dealt with inappropriately by a member of the @entity20 reception staff			0
' a letter has been sent by the practice to the parents to offer an explanation and an apology			0
' at @entity177 there is a protocol for dealing with accidents in what are called " common areas " like the atrium			0
one of the practices in @entity11 is responsible for responding to emergency calls each month			0
usually a nurse or gp from the " on call " practice assesses the situation and if an ambulance is not required then the patient is advised to attend their registered practice where their medical notes are held			1
' the practice " on call " in january was @entity197 which in this situation , was not called			0
the @entity20 receptionist was responding to the protocol described above in asking where the child was registered and suggesting the parent take her to her registered surgery			2
' both the surgery and the @entity151 do understand that in this circumstance , a more natural reaction for the receptionist would have been to take the child to a nurse for first aid			0
as a result of this , the practice will review this event and how it was dealt with in order that lessons for the future are learned			0

@entity6 fell over and cut her head inside a medical centre , but was turned away from the closest gp surgery
when she reached her own *gps* they treated her without checking whether she was registered
she was kept in hospital overnight with suspected concussion
