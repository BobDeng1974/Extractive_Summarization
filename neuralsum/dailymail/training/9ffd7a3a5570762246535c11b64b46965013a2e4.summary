scientists said ' safe ' levels of dietary sugar - found in a can of fizzy drink , for example - could be having invisible adverse effects on people 's health even ' safe ' levels of sugar could be having invisible adverse effects on our health , @entity14 researchers			1
researchers gave mice the equivalent of a healthy human diet plus three cans of fizzy drink a day and found the female animals died twice as fast as those whose food was not largely composed of sugar			1
male mice consuming the sugary diet were less able to hold territory and reproduce , leading scientists to speculate that sugar has a damaging effect on the health of mammals , including humans			1
scientists from the @entity34 said the mice showed no sign of suffering serious physical changes in their bodies			2
writing in the online edition of the journal @entity42 , the researchers said : ' our results provide evidence that added sugar consumed at concentrations currently considered safe exerts dramatic adverse impacts on mammalian health			0
' mice on the experimental diet received 25 percent of their energy intake in the form of added sugar , no matter how many calories they ate			0
in human terms this was equivalent to a person eating a normal healthy diet plus three cans of sugar - sweetened fizzy drinks a day			2
after 32 weeks , more than a third of the female mice fed extra sugar died - twice the number fed a non-sugary diet			2
the death rate of males was not affected , but their survival behaviour was			0
males on the sugary diet acquired and held on to 26 percent fewer territories than their normal diet nest - mates and produced 25 percent fewer offspring			2
researchers gave mice the equivalent of a healthy human diet plus three fizzy drink cans a day and found the female animals died twice as fast as those whose food was not largely composed of sugar			1
male mice consuming the sugary diet were less able to hold territory and reproduce study leader professor @entity87 , at the university , said : ' this demonstrates the adverse effects of added sugars at human - relevant levels			1
' to observe the mice in a more realistic setting , the researchers kept them in room - sized pens rather than cages			0
this allowed them to compete more naturally for mates and desirable territories			0
despite the effects on the mice , the sugar - fed animals showed only minor metabolic changes , including raised cholesterol			1
the study found nothing unusual in terms of obesity or insulin and blood sugar levels			1
' our test shows an adverse outcome from the added - sugar diet that could n't be detected by conventional tests , ' said professor @entity87			0
the study found nothing unusual in terms of obesity or insulin and blood sugar levels			1
professor @entity87 believes the test shows an adverse outcome from the added - sugar diet that could n't be detected by conventional tests however , some people think the study does not hint at a similar effect in humans , including those in the drinks industry			0
@entity130 , director general of the @entity132 @entity131 said : ' the overwhelming body of scientific evidence does not support the claims made by the authors of this study			0
' it ’s also worth remembering that the government ’s national dietary surveys show that sugar consumption in the @entity132 has actually declined over the last decade			0

@entity14 researchers gave mice sugary diet and found female animals died twice as fast as those eating healthy *snacks*
scientists from the @entity34 found male mice consuming the sugary diet were less able to hold territory and reproduce
*strangely* the animals showed no signs of ill - health including obesity or raised blood sugar levels
