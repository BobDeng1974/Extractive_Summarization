by @entity0 a mother has been threatened with a fine and criminal record for taking her terminally ill son out of school for what could be his final holiday			1
@entity7 , 56 , wanted to take @entity8 , 13 , a quadriplegic with cerebral palsy , on the trip of a lifetime after doctors said he could die between the ages of 14 and 19			1
the mother - of - three was due to take her son on a cruise during this october 's half - term holiday , but she had to move it because the ship was n't equipped to handle his needs			1
precious time : @entity7 wants to take @entity8 on holiday before he dies so she changed the date to later in october and requested a holiday form from the school			1
however , she was left ' flabbergasted and shocked ' when the mainstream school , with provisions for special needs , refused and told her she could be fined or face a criminal record			1
mrs @entity7 , from @entity30 , @entity31 , told @entity32 : ' my son is 14 in october			1
this could well be his last holiday			2
' @entity8 is a quadriplegic , has cerebral palsy and epilepsy and is registered blind			1
he is never going to have a career , he is going to spend the rest of his life with us looking after him			0
' the only relaxation he can get is swimming , so a cruise ship with a pool where he can also enjoy the sensory motion of a boat is ideal for him			1
' i asked for a holiday request form from the school but was absolutely shocked and flabbergasted when the response was " no "			0
exceptional case : @entity8 is due to go on holiday with his mother in october but his school has said she will be fined ' it 's the thought that i might be committing a crime that upsets me			1
i am a law - abiding citizen and this has been very stressful			0
' mrs @entity7 , who runs a nursery in @entity30 , has been working all summer while other staff members take holidays , so that her trip could coincide with her silver wedding anniversary to husband @entity67 , and @entity8 's birthday			2
one of her elder sons took to @entity70 to share the problem , with other friends and parents lending their support			0
mrs @entity7 added : ' people were saying they would set up a @entity77 page to pay our fines but the fines are not the problem			2
' @entity82 , the leader of @entity83 , said : ' this case does sound like exceptional circumstances			0
i am keen to talk to the headteacher ... to make sure they understand the circumstances			0
' the @entity89 added : ' we have been clear that all headteachers are free to grant pupils leave in exceptional circumstances			0
' mrs @entity7 is n't the first to fall foul of the strict holiday rules , which were introduced by the former education secretary @entity95			1
@entity96 , from @entity97 in @entity98 , was fined £ 120 for taking her son to a family wedding in september , with an additional £ 150 being added when she failed to pay on time - because she had been referred for ovarian cancer			2
@entity102 , from @entity103 , was fined for taking his daughter out of school because it was the only time he could get off work			0
he had booked it 12 months in advance and was told it was okay			0
however , when the rule changes came in , he returned from his holiday to find a letter saying he would be fined £ 60			2
more than 200,000 people have signed a petition against the policy on the @entity118 website .			0
