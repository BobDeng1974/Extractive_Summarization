@entity0 emerged 2 - 0 victors in a rather awkward - feeling fixture against @entity3 in the @entity4 in @entity5			1
starting with a relatively strong line up including @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 , boss @entity6 used this an opportunity to give many of his starlets some much - needed first team experience			1
despite @entity10 and @entity9 both gladly putting their names on the score sheet , there was some sad news for the @entity20 as @entity21 came off injured just eight minutes after coming on at half time			1
host commentator ultimately @entity0 will be the happier of the two teams			2
a good second half display from @entity6 's men as they return to @entity28 with a 2 - 0 victory against @entity3			1
next up - @entity30 ! thanks for tuning in everyone ! there is a feeling this game is winding down to a close now			0
city will be happy with the result , @entity3 not so much after their spritely start to the match			0
@entity10 shows his composure to beat the on - rushing @entity3 goalkeeper @entity41 @entity42 on for @entity44 @entity43 replaces @entity45 on for @entity46 @entity48 work from @entity46 leads to him crossing the ball for @entity9 , who similarly to @entity10 , controls with his chest and directs the ball into the back of the net			1
@entity55 is put through but still has some work to do as the @entity3 defence triple up on him			2
the limited crowd are going wild every time the @entity59 touches the ball			0
@entity61 makes way for @entity63 is brought off for @entity64 @entity10 comes off as @entity55 comes on to a rapturous applause			1
one quirky @entity0 fan skipped a day in the library to be here today			0
let 's hope his dad is n't watching ! after a good phase of play from @entity3 , @entity70 is there to read the game well and cut out a through ball to @entity75			1
@entity76 on for @entity77 @entity78 comes on for @entity79 @entity80 on for @entity21 there 's a slight coming together between @entity3 goalkeeper @entity41 and and @entity21 , who is 8 minutes into his first team debut			1
as the @entity0 forward goes for an overhead kick , @entity41 clatters into him and they both land in a pile			0
the stretcher is brought on and the 17 - year - old is withdrawn as quickly as he was brought on			0
a great long ball from @entity91 finds @entity10 in the box , who chests and blast home			0
@entity41 just fails to do enough to stop it but it rolls in			0
@entity21 on for @entity99 @entity91 on for @entity8 @entity41 on for @entity100 replaces @entity101 on for @entity102 who can break the deadlock ? let 's find out shall we ? relatively dull opening 40 minutes or so			1
the action only really began with @entity0 's double chance and the disallowed @entity3 goal when @entity61 's strike was ricocheted in off one of his own players in an offside position			1
@entity44 takes an out - swinging corner from the left and @entity116 strikes , but it is deflected narrowly wide			1
a corner is then taken from the other side and it ends up with @entity10 , who tries to curl one into the top corner but it goes just over			0
@entity77 has a free kick from 30 yards blocked by the wall			0
the ball rebounds back to the feet of the former @entity126 man , but his half - volley takes a deflection into the thankful hands of @entity130			2
@entity0 's @entity46 once again drives down the right towards the @entity3 goal , but just before he is able to pull the trigger he is intercepted			1
@entity0 try to work a short corner in the follow up , but it comes to nothing			2
possession mainly being held in the midfield area as we head past the half hour mark			0
@entity3 still probing away but they are yet to make any real clear cut chances patient build up for @entity0 this time , who are looking to find a way through the @entity3 midfield			1
@entity146 is cautioned for a silly tackle on the edge of his own box , but the resulting free kick fails to test the goalkeeper			0
@entity9 is slipped through by @entity152 and he shoots from just inside the box , but it is blocked out for a corner			1
@entity46 is looking most likely down that right flank as he drills another low ball across the penalty box box @entity10 fails to meet it at the back stick			1
the ball falls to @entity99 on the edge of the box but his shot is blazed over			0
@entity3 are happy to build up play with some patient possession , which ends with @entity77 letting rip from 25 yards			1
@entity130 deals with it well			0
first real chance of the game goes to @entity0 as @entity46 squares a ball across the box			2
but it is cleared for a corner			0
the @entity0 players get limbered up ahead of the mid-week friendly clash			2
7 min : @entity77 finds an opportunity to squeeze in a shot but it merely dribbles towards goal			2
the @entity20 clearly want to show off their domestic prowess as the teams pass the illustrious @entity180 trophy			0
the @entity0 squad turned up in style to the @entity4			0
the 36 - year - old will no doubt want to take this opportunity to prove to @entity6 that he is fit for a regular starting berth in his title chasing side			0
@entity3 captain @entity77 knows @entity180 defences well , having played two seasons at @entity126			2
the @entity190 has three goals for his club this season and will be looking to keep the @entity0 midfield quiet			0
@entity0 face @entity3 in a specially - arranged midweek friendly at the @entity4 in @entity5			1
the match will be used as preparation for @entity3 as they gear up for the resumption of their season , while @entity0 will use the match to get their players in - tune ahead of their @entity205 match against @entity30			2
city boss @entity6 has fielded a strong side with the likes of @entity46 and @entity9 starting			2
will he rue this decision in a meaningless game ? @entity3 starting xi : @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity102 , @entity63 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity79 , van der @entity77 , @entity61 , @entity75 , @entity216 @entity0 starting xi : @entity130 , @entity116 , @entity70 , @entity146 , @entity44 , @entity99 , @entity8 , @entity46 , @entity152 , @entity10 , @entity9 subs : @entity218 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity45 , @entity219 , @entity55 , @entity220 , @entity91 , @entity221 , @entity21			1
