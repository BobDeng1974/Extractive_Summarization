by @entity0 with a starring role in the original @entity3 , and a much - publicised comeback in june wearing a tiny asymmetric thong , @entity1 appears a picture of confidence			1
but behind the cameras the 20 - year - old has been battling ' food phobia ' issues for over a decade			1
it was only two years ago when doctors said he would have to be admitted to a rehab clinic that the @entity17 boy started to change his eating habits			1
' if i did n’t like the look or smell of food i 'd hide it behind my tongue and spill it all out in the toilet			1
i 'd be going two or three times in a meal , ' @entity1 admitted as he opened up to @entity27 and @entity28 on @entity30 's @entity29			1
when it used to get cold i used to shake and shiver all the time because i had no meat on me			2
i was just skin and bone			2
' my mum would be forever sending me to a doctor because she was always concerned about my weight , ' said the tv star who admitted he used to weigh just 7st 7lbs			1
' for a boy that ’s really bad			0
the average is 10 to 11st			2
' doctors said if i continued losing weight they would have to send me into a clinic			1
for me that was the scariest point ever and that ’s when i knew i had to change			2
' @entity1 's issues , which this @entity29 's eating expert dr @entity59 , described as a ' food phobia ' started at the age of eight			1
' @entity62 is very common , ' explained dr @entity59 , who shared the sofa with @entity1			1
' generally children grow out of it			0
when it becomes a problem is when it gets worse			0
' for @entity1 , what started as being a difficult eater in childhood , spiraled out of control in his teenage years			1
' i 've always been a fussy eater but it turned into @entity75			0
my poor mum would bring out the food and everything would have to be separate , ' he said			2
' if i had a roast dinner i 'd have the peas on their own , sweetcorn on its own and chicken its on own			0
at the time i did n’t see it as a problem because i was so young			0
' @entity3 and dr @entity59 ( far left ) with @entity27 and @entity28 on @entity30 's ' @entity29 ' ' i ’d always have a a panic going out for bit of dinner because i knew i would n’t have anything on the menu , ' he continued			1
@entity1 emerging from @entity30 studios after coming clean about his food phobia ' most of the time i would just go and sit with friends and just have a coke whilst they had their burgers			1
' when doctors told @entity1 he needed to be admitted to a clinic , he knew he had to change his ways			1
' it took a long time , ' he admitted , ' but i found what i enjoyed eating – plain food			2
i 'd have boiled plain pasta with plain chicken			0
' i started eating six meals a day but i 'd make them really small so i ’d always feel full			2
i 'd also have nuts in the day and lots of protein			0
i 've also had protein shakes and i train			0
' i know i 'm no pump - up @entity116 or anything , but it helps me bulk a little bit and look fuller			0
now i ’m 10st and happy with how i look and feel			0
but another stone for me would be perfect			2
' my energy is ten times better , although i 've also been diagnosed with an under - active thyroid so i 'm always a bit tired			0
but i feel better in myself			0
' good enough , in fact , to parade his filled - out body in a tiny weeny weeny asymmetric thong			1
' two years ago i would never have dreamed of anything like that , ' @entity1 admitted			1
' for me to do that was such a big thing			0
and hearing the response as well was amazing			0
it went global , ' he said of the edgy swimwear trend			0
@entity1 now wants to dedicate himself to helping children with eating issues and said , ' i want to go round to schools and talk about it and turn my negative into a positive			1

@entity1 , 20 , opened up on @entity30 's @entity29
weighed 7st 7lbs at lowest point
would hide food in his mouth and ' spill it ' into the toilet to avoid eating
this @entity29 's dr @entity152 described @entity1 's issue as a ' food phobia '
changed habits two years ago when doctors *threatened* to admit him
now a *healthy* 10 stone and feels more confident and energised
@entity161 would never have had confidence for recent @entity3 comeback in asymmetric thong before *putting* on weight
