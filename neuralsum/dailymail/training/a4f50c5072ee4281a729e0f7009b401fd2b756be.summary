when the @entity2 playing squad first heard of the club ’s interest in @entity5 last month , the reaction was not universally positive			2
good enough reason to suggest , therefore , that the 62 - year - old @entity8 coach may transpire to be exactly the right choice			1
a year ago , there were not many dissenting voices in and around football following the appointment of @entity15			2
many commentators who criticise that choice now were happy to declare themselves in favour at the time			2
what is clear , however , is that @entity2 ’s playing squad now need a firm hand			2
they need to realise , and quickly , that , contrary to what they may presume , their voices are not the most important ones at @entity30 ’s biggest football club			1
new man in charge : @entity5 will take over at @entity2 after the @entity33 @entity15 , it transpired , could n’t hold on tight enough to a group of players unsettled and unnerved by the presence in their midst of anyone other than sir @entity40 and his familiar band of coaches			2
for @entity44 , we should presume that will not be a problem			1
he has a reputation for being forthright , positive and free of self - doubt			0
he will need to be all of these things as he looks to restore the proper order of things at @entity52 and , further down the road , tries to restore @entity2 to their accustomed place at the top of the @entity56			0
for @entity2 , this is life after @entity59 this is the bit that they really have to get right			0
one bad appointment is a nuisance			0
two , however , starts to chip away at reputation , at standing and at prospects			0
@entity15 was an appointment for the long - term and it did n’t work simply because he could n’t get the short - term part right			2
@entity44 , sticking to that theme , is perhaps a man for the mid-term , a coach who must guide @entity2 over a bump in the road that has grown an awful lot bigger over the last few months			1
getting the team together : @entity44 will be chared with getting the @entity2 players pulling in the same direction cups of joy : @entity44 has a habit of winning trophies in his career at @entity84 and @entity85 the second coming ? @entity44 's reign is set to be like @entity40 's in terms of the respect that he commands @entity44 ’s record shows that he does n’t tend to stay in one place for too long			1
after almost a decade at @entity84 , he did three years at @entity85 , two with @entity91 , another with @entity85 , four at @entity92 and two at @entity94			0
from that point of view , the three - year contract handed him by the @entity99 family feels about right			0
ideally , @entity2 may have liked a younger man			0
at @entity52 , though , priorities have changed dramatically since last summer			0
@entity2 are a club that can not afford to slip any further behind @entity103 and @entity104			1
currently they are no longer even in their rivals ’ slipstream and @entity44 ’s appointment – as strange as it sounds – is just as much about moving @entity2 forwards again , about arresting decline , as much as it is about winning the @entity56 next season			1
@entity44 , in many ways , is a safe option and the @entity8 coach arrives to find a squad in dire need of an overhaul			1
getting it right : @entity120 played a key role in the appointment of @entity44 @entity2 won the @entity56 just a year ago but suddenly theirs is a squad short of at least two new central defenders and maybe two left backs			1
it also needs at least one central midfield player , one wide player and maybe a centre forward			0
@entity2 chief executive @entity120 has been talking big in terms of projected spending			0
once @entity44 takes proper stock , however , @entity120 may find that even £ 150m begins to look rather conservative			1
currently , @entity2 appear to be stuck a little between the old regime and the new in terms of transfer targets			0
@entity120 had hoped that the list of players put together by @entity15 would withstand the scrutiny of the new manager			1
the wrong one : @entity15 ' appointment was a mistake - although there were not too many dissenting voices at the time plenty to work on : the @entity2 squad will be expected to do better than last season that , of course , was always unlikely and currently the club ’s stated aim of doing most of their business before the @entity33 looks startlingly unrealistic			2
@entity44 is now on the cusp of a @entity33 campaign with @entity91 and will not be seen at @entity52 until the middle of july			1
as such , the synergy between him and his chief executive is going to be a damn sight better than that between @entity160 and @entity15 if @entity2 ’s squad is going to be competitive by the start of next season			0
in the background , meanwhile , lurks @entity165			1
@entity44 ’s decision to give @entity165 a key role on his staff represents the safe option and something of a risk all at the same time			1
it gives the new @entity2 manager a link between himself and his dressing room already as well as insight in to how the club works and what it expects , on and off the field			1
a good link : keeping @entity165 as his no 2 will give him a link to the playing squad a pipe dream : @entity165 and his fellow class of 92 teammates @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 would never have worked at this time should things not start well for @entity44 , though , he may find that the man next to him in the dugout begins to represent a threat – at least in terms of the public ’s perception – as much as anything else			1
there is a faction among the @entity2 support – romantic fools that they are - that would have liked to see @entity165 and his former team - mates – the so - called ‘ @entity204 ’ – given the job			1
management by collective , so to speak			0
that would never have worked			0
a club needs a manager , a figurehead , a leader			2
the man @entity2 have chosen certainly has broad enough shoulders to cope			0
@entity120 and the @entity99 family must hope he has the flexibility and the wherewithal to adapt to the @entity56 , too			0
another poor appointment and @entity2 could find themselves adrift			0
@entity40 @entity218 1 @entity220 title @entity221 3 @entity223 titles 4 @entity224 1 @entity225 1 @entity226 1 @entity227 @entity2 13 @entity56 titles 5 @entity224 @entity229 2 @entity230 1 @entity226 1 @entity231 : 1999 , 1 @entity232 : 2008 @entity5 @entity84 3 @entity8 titles 1 @entity234 1 @entity230 1 @entity227 1 @entity231 @entity85 2 @entity236 title 1 @entity237 1 @entity227 @entity92 1 @entity8 title @entity94 1 @entity240 title * @entity242 trophies only			2

@entity44 has had sucess everywhere he has been a manager
@entity8 does not tend to stick around at clubs for too long
@entity165 will provide @entity44 with a link to the dressing room
united players need to realise they *'re* not most important *people* at club
the club ca *n't* afford to fall too far behind @entity104 and @entity103
