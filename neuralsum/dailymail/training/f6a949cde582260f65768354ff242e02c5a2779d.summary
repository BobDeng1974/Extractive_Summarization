by @entity0 published : 11:36 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 14:56 est , 4 january 2013 as most start the @entity1 trying to burn fat from their bulging waistlines , spare a thought for the poor people clearing the many tonnes of grease and oil millions of @entity10 poured down the drain this @entity12			1
these pictures show the state of our sewers after the festive period - bunged up with solid grease while ' fatbergs ' float through the sea of pipes under out feet			1
many will end up blocked , causing flooding on the street and sometimes leading to putrid water flowing back into homes through their choked sinks and toilets			0
nappies , baby wipes and cotton buds thrown down the toilet account for a third of all blockages on top of this fatty waste @entity59 has said it has even found a christmas tree down its sewers after someone shoved it down a manhole			1
' you just wo n't believe what ends up in the sewage system			0
' we 've even found a christmas tree down there , ' a spokesman said			1
companies say at least 50 per cent of all blockages they are called out are caused by solid fat			1
nappies , baby wipes and cotton buds thrown down toilet account for another third of all blockages			2
@entity80 , @entity82 ’s @entity81 for the @entity84 area said : ' there is a misconception that sewers are vast , cavernous tunnels but in truth the majority are very narrow pipes , of no more than a few inches in diameter			0
' it is very easy for these narrow pipelines to become blocked , causing waste water to back up and spill , spoiling the natural environment			0
' @entity99 clears a 1,000 tonnes of fat a year , costing it £ 12m in call - outs to clear blocked pipes			2
food fat and wet wipes are the main partners in sewer abuse crime , accounting for 75 per cent of the 80,000 blockages a year that @entity108 has to clear from its 109,000km network at a cost of £ 1million a month			2
' in around 1,000 of these cases , householders literally get their own back - in the form of sewage backing up through toilets and sinks , ' a spokesman said			0
probe : this photo taken in @entity99 last month shows ' fatbergs ' floating along which grow together to form giant block - inducing lumps blocked : this drain in @entity125 , @entity126 , shows how fatty waste can stop water flowing completely			0

problem costs companies millions a year to fix as 25 **%** more fat is washed away during festive period
50 **%** of all blockages caused by grease sent down the sink or toilet
@entity59 says it has found a christmas tree in the sewer
