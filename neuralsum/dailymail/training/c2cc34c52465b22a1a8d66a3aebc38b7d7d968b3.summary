they are the most complex			2
to me , nothing compares to it			2
’ he also confirmed that , of all the places he has visited on earth , his favourite is not the fascinating @entity40 islands or the plains of @entity42 , but the south west @entity44 district of @entity45 - upon - @entity46			1

i had a friend who had a raven and i watched it being given a bottle with a piece of meat in it			0
and straightaway it dipped it in a pond and shook the food out			0
it took all of 30 seconds			0
‘ i said to its owner , “ you must have trained it to do that ” but he said that it had learned to do it on its own in about two minutes			0
’ father of two sir @entity0 , who is brother to the late director @entity138 , said that his interest in animals was recently echoed by a seven - year - old girl who had written to him about one of his programmes			1
