@entity1 ’s removal of the debris from their @entity4 car crash gathered apace with the selection of three uncapped players for the first test since the ignominy of @entity10 and a return for a survivor of an @entity14 whitewash past			1
a squad which mixes new faces in @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 with an experienced spine is most eye - catching for the return of a bowler from @entity1 ’s past who looked finished when released by @entity26 two years ago			1
@entity27 toured @entity28 when @entity1 lost 5 - 0 in 2006 - 07 without playing a test but is now poised for his first appearance at the highest level for seven years after being revitalised by working with @entity32 at @entity33			1
hurting : @entity34 has missed out on a place in @entity1 's @entity37 squad for the series against @entity39 back in the running : @entity34 has returned for @entity26 after his hand injury point to prove : however , he has only bowled 36 championship overs this season impressive : @entity19 ( left ) has starred for @entity1 in the @entity44 against @entity39 @entity27 , 29 , has been the most consistently quick bowler in the country this season and is the favourite in the 12 to play ahead of @entity48 after @entity1 decided that @entity34 was not quite ready to regain his place in the new order			1
‘ before joining @entity33 i was going nowhere and coming to @entity55 gave me a new lease of life , ’ said @entity27 , who had lost all confidence in his action by the time of his departure from @entity26			2
‘ i have benefited from a change of scenery and a coaching team that put faith in my ability			0
’ that team is headed by an @entity4 in @entity32 , who deserves the gratitude of @entity1 for developing the most impressive crop of home - grown players in the country , with @entity33 becoming a model county for others to emulate			2
‘ the coaching staff have given me a simple vision which is to run in and bowl fast , ’ said @entity27			2
‘ i ’m not over-complicating things			0
i ’m just concentrating on generating pace and being as aggressive as i can			0
when i joined @entity33 i set myself the goal of playing for @entity1 again but this still came as a shock			2
’ @entity1 consider pace and aggression as their key weapons against @entity39 on what they hope will be quick pitches now they have to fill the massive gap left by @entity85 , the most important casualty of the winter of discontent			2
it is an indictment on @entity1 ’s spin resources that no specialist is considered good enough to take @entity85 ’s place but at least that gives an opportunity to the gifted @entity18 , who is the best bowler among the all - round candidates to play at @entity95 which included @entity96 and @entity97			1
@entity97 , of course , was the incumbent having played in that final horror show in @entity10 but misses out along with others who featured at the @entity101 but are unlikely to play test cricket again in @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and , of course , @entity107			0
in all only seven players remain from the winter @entity14 squad but it is the experienced five among them in @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 who @entity1 want to provide the backbone for the new era while the youngsters around them learn the @entity37 ropes			1
accumulator : @entity4 - born batsman @entity17 is tipped to open for @entity1 with @entity110 congratulations : @entity28 batsman @entity121 tweeted his delight at @entity17 's @entity1 call - up the fast show : @entity27 has been bowling at 90mph for @entity33 this season and has been recalled by @entity1 seven years after his last test , against @entity126 in 2007 12 - man squad : @entity110 , @entity17 , @entity111 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity18 , prior , @entity130 , @entity113 , @entity27 , @entity114 , @entity131			1
‘ there is expectation on those senior players not only to deliver but also to re-energise the team and integrate newcomers in the right , positive way , ’ said national selector @entity132			0
‘ it ’s very important that they are fit and firing			0
’ there will be those who are surprised by @entity112 ’s return after just one championship match behind the stumps following a recurrence of his chronic @entity150 condition but @entity110 wants this important team man back by his side and @entity132 said @entity153 is ‘ just the sort of character we want in the team			2
’ @entity158 is clearly prior ’s long - term successor but it was only his brilliant century at @entity95 in the fourth one - day international that catapulted him into contention ahead of @entity163 and the bottom line is his keeping is not yet good enough for @entity37 level			1
prior is the correct choice for @entity1 now			0
the other two newcomers to @entity1 ’s ranks will both once again raise the vexed question of nationality as @entity17 is undoubtedly @entity4 while @entity19 is as @entity172 as @entity173 both have long since committed themselves to @entity1 , both comfortably fulfil the criterion for selection and both are brimming with promise and , in @entity19 ’s case , achievement already at international level			1
ready to go : @entity110 will lead his @entity1 side out against @entity39 in the first test at @entity95 second beginning : @entity183 is embarking on another stint as @entity1 's test coach next week ten players who were in the @entity14 squad are not in the party to face @entity39			1
@entity85 has retired , @entity107 has been sacked , @entity189 is having time off with stress - related issues while @entity103 , @entity34 , @entity105 , @entity97 , @entity104 , @entity191 and @entity192 have all been overlooked			0
‘ this is a special moment and i ’m very proud , ’ said @entity17 , who was born in @entity10 to an @entity4 father and @entity195 mother			0
‘ i grew up in @entity28 but i came here at 18 and i ’ve been here my whole adult life			0
i love @entity1 and this is where my life is			0
you could say i ’m an old - fashioned cricketer			0
i have n’t played much @entity201 and i just try to get stuck in and bat as long as i can			0
’ it is surprising that @entity34 , the one glimmer of hope from the @entity14 , is omitted but @entity1 want their fourth seamer to have more than the 36 overs the @entity26 all - rounder has under his belt this season after recovering from a self - inflicted broken wrist			1
@entity34 will come again but otherwise @entity1 have picked a promising looking mix of new and old players and one in @entity27 who will provide hope to any county performers who appear to have lost their way in domestic cricket .			1

@entity27 selected after a seven - year *absence*
@entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 could all make debuts
@entity112 keeps his place despite @entity158 's emergence
@entity183 ' second @entity37 reign as @entity1 coach begins next week
ten players who featured in @entity14 not *selcted* against @entity39
