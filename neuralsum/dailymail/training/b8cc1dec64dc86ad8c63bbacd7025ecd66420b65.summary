the @entity1 surface - to - air missile system believed to have shot down @entity3 flight @entity4 is an old @entity6 - built weapon designed to engage aircraft , cruise missiles and drones that is still widely used in eastern @entity11 states , including @entity12			1
they are capable of taking down aircraft the size of a @entity16 flying at a cruising altitude of 33,000 feet , meaning the intensity of the impact is likely to have blown the plane apart in the sky			2
witnesses says wreckage and body parts of the passengers and crew are scattered over an area of around nine miles , reinforcing the idea that the plane broke up mid-air			0
a launcher similar to the @entity1 missile system was seen earlier today by journalists near the eastern town of @entity49 , which is held by @entity51 rebels			0
the @entity1 , developed by the @entity6 in 1979 , has remained widely in use throughout the former @entity6 states , including @entity12			1
until then it was assumed the only surface - to - air missiles in rebel hands were shoulder - held launchers with a maximum engagement range of 10,000 feet			1
in a statement @entity59 separatist leader @entity58 said that he was certain that @entity12 troops had shot it down but gave no explanation for that statement			0
@entity65 said he was not aware of whether rebel forces owned @entity1 missile launchers , but even if they did , there had no fighters capable of operating it			2
down : smoke billows into the sky after a @entity3 passenger plane was shot out of the sky at 33,000ft over eastern @entity12 , killing all 295 people on board the @entity12 authorities have laid the blame for the attack on the rebels by denying any responsibility for the missile launch			0
@entity4 , which was carrying 280 passengers and 15 crew , was flying between @entity85 and @entity86 after taking off at lunchtime today			0
tv pictures from the scene showed a pall of smoke billowing into the sky near @entity59 , apparently from the stricken aircraft			0
earlier , @entity51 rebels claimed responsibility for surface - to - air missile on two @entity98 - 25 jets yesterday			1
the @entity99 said the second jet was hit by a portable surface - to - air missile - not a @entity1 - adding that the pilot was unscathed and managed to land his plane safely .			1

@entity1 surface - to - air launchers designed to engage aircraft and cruise missiles
can easily take down a large plane up to an altitude of 75,000 feet
@entity1 launchers were first developed in the @entity6 in the late 1970s
