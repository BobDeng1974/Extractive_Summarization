@entity1 's strikers were going through a training drill in the sunshine at @entity4 on thursday , swerving between metal dummies and hitting the back of the net from inside the penalty box with impressive regularity			1
doing it for real this season has proved rather more difficult for the @entity13 ’s relegation favourites			1
they have now failed to score for 616 minutes			1
if @entity17 ’s team draw another blank at @entity19 on saturday , they will break two club records : their longest goal drought in all competitions of 651 minutes , and the longest in the league which stands at 596			1
@entity24 scores a stunner against @entity26 in @entity13 opener in their first game of the season in august , @entity1 stunned title favourites @entity26 by taking the lead with a wonderful strike from @entity24			1
few were surprised that they failed to hold on to the lead that night , but not many expected the @entity1 to draw a blank in their next five league games against @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 ( where @entity24 had a late penalty saved ) , @entity41 and @entity42 , not to mention a @entity44 tie at home to @entity46			1
the reality of life at this level has bitten hard			0
injuries to @entity51 and @entity52 , last season ’s 47 - goal strike partnership , have been a significant factor			1
@entity17 compared that to @entity57 losing @entity58 to @entity59 and @entity60 to injury			1
but while @entity62 was given the £ 75million @entity57 banked from @entity58 ’s sale to strengthen his squad , @entity17 spent just £ 1.5m on @entity65 from @entity66 and another £ 600,000 on @entity68 ’s @entity67			1
@entity1 have not had another goal to celebrate since @entity24 's strike @entity65 has failed to find net since joining from @entity66 ‘ look at @entity57 with @entity58 and @entity60 , ’ said @entity17			1
‘ they ’ve obviously found it tough to lose those players			0
we had @entity51 and @entity52 who were flying last season			1
‘ but the challenge is for the next people to come in and deliver performances			0
‘ @entity62 ’s team will come good , no doubt , but they ’ve spent £ 100m			1
we are n’t that type of club			2
we know the challenge and it ’s going to be tough			2
‘ people were asking last week if we were too defensive			0
fact : we ’re three points behind @entity88 who bought a £ 28m striker ( @entity90 )			0
we have n’t been able to do that			0
it ’s working with what we ’ve got and making the best of it			2
‘ it ’s a massive learning curve getting used to this level			2
it ’s not just the attacking in the @entity13 , the defending goes up as well			1
we ’ve had goalkeepers who have pulled off very high - quality saves , which is another change from the @entity103 and the divisions below			0
’ @entity51 ( centre ) and @entity52 scored 47 goals between them last season @entity17 compares being without @entity51 and @entity52 to @entity57 losing @entity58 and @entity60 @entity17 remains positive and demands the same attitude from his players			1
but how does he keep their spirits up when the ball just wo n’t go in ? ‘ you look to reinforce their belief systems , ’ he added			0
‘ they ’re only human			0
not everyone is super- confident and some players sit on that knife - edge			0
‘ we reinforce the positive side of the game and the simplicity of it			2
of course you hope for a goal because sometimes it alters mindsets and re-ignites confidence in people			2
‘ you ’re waiting for the individuals to catch fire within that system and score			2
there are goals in people , it ’s just delivering it			0
i believe in the players we have at the club , otherwise i would n’t have them here			0
‘ we have n’t gone obsessively into attacking but we ’ve obviously tried to tweak things			0
we have to turn the screw and make sure those chances become goals			0
can we make different types of chances than your stereotypical ones like a cross and a header ? what kind of crosses , what kind of finishes , what kind of movement in the box ? ‘ we ’re getting into the right area but the hardest thing for coaches and managers to provide is that final touch into the net			0

@entity1 's only goal this season came in the opening @entity13 game against @entity26
the @entity1 have since failed to score in in five @entity13 games and a @entity44 tie against @entity46
if @entity17 ’s team draw another blank at @entity19 on saturday , they will break two club records
