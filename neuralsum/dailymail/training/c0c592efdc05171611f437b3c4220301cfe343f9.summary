campaigners demanded an overhaul of @entity3 ’s abortion laws last night after figures revealed that most doctors never meet the women whose terminations they are approving			1
under the @entity9 , no termination is supposed to go ahead unless two doctors have judged the case and decided ‘ in good faith ’ that it would be in the woman ’s best interests			1
doctors who can not show this can be prosecuted			2
@entity18 : last night it emerged that in only 46 per cent of abortion cases is there a record that either of the certifying doctors has actually met the pregnant woman to make a fully - informed decision ( file picture ) but last night it emerged that in only 46 per cent of cases is there a record that either of the certifying doctors has actually met the pregnant woman to make a fully - informed decision			1
instead , less - qualified nurses interview the applicant to decide whether an abortion would harm the woman ’s physical or mental health , with the two doctors simply signing the forms later			1
in 2012 , as many as 98,000 terminations – or 378 every working day – were given the go - ahead without any record of the doctor having met the woman			1
criticism : @entity44 , the architect of the @entity9 , told the @entity45 that the figures were ' regrettable ' and ' against the spirit of the law ' the statistics were revealed following a parliamentary question by sir @entity51 , a @entity52 member of the @entity53 ’ all - party pro-life group , who said : ‘ these appalling figures show we have abortion on demand			1
‘ it ’s just a farce when doctors sign off forms saying women ’s mental health will be damaged when half of the time ... they do n’t even bother to see the patient			1
’ the @entity68 said the revelations were unacceptable and called on doctors to ensure they approve abortions only if they have been properly investigated			2
but a spokesman confirmed that guidance did not force doctors to meet abortion applicants			1
@entity44 , the architect of the @entity77 , told the @entity45 that the figures were ‘ regrettable ’ and ‘ against the spirit of the law ’			2
and fellow @entity81 peer @entity80 , who successfully campaigned for the abortion limit to be reduced to 24 weeks in the 1990s , demanded a review of the @entity9			1
‘ these figures confirm just how lightly the provisions of the @entity77 are taken by some practitioners , ’ he said			2
‘ unlike other pieces of major legislation , the @entity9 has never been reviewed			1
‘ with around 600 babies aborted every working day , surely it is time we looked again at how the law is implemented in order to combat the casual attitude to unborn life so clearly in evidence here			0
’ last year 185,222 terminations were carried out in @entity98 and @entity99 amid fears that women were able to get abortion on demand			1
last night @entity104 , chief executive of the @entity105 , accused the government and police of turning a blind eye while doctors acted merely as ‘ rubber stamps ’			0
concern : the statistics were revealed following a parliamentary question by sir @entity51 ( left ) , whom deemed them ' alarming '			0
meanwhile , @entity81 peer @entity80 ( right ) has called for a review of the act he said : ‘ it beggars belief that this situation has been allowed to develop while the police , regulators and parliament have effectively turned a blind eye			0
’ @entity125 , from anti-abortion group comment on @entity127 , said nurses did not have the expertise to decide whether a woman ’s mental or physical health would be under threat by a pregnancy			1
she added : ‘ the suggestion that two doctors are required to sign a termination off does not mean two doctors in another city or two doctors in cyberspace			2
' if the @entity9 was applied as intended , we would have nowhere near the almost 200,000 abortions a year that we have now			2
’ shocking : between 1,400 and 4,722 girls were never born because of abortions carried out due to them being the ' wrong ' sex , a study claims thousands of girls were never born because of abortions carried out due to them being the ‘ wrong ’ sex , a study claims			0
between 1,400 and 4,722 girls are missing from the population through abortions on mothers who did not want girls , analysis of census figures shows			0
it follows the scandal last year when doctors were exposed as willing to authorise abortions purely on the grounds that the baby was female			0
yesterday ’s report , based on 2011 national census figures , revealed that in some areas of @entity3 the proportion of boys born compared to girls is much higher than the natural rate			0
the usual ratio is 105 boys to 100 girls born , which keeps the population in balance as boys are more likely to die in childhood			0
but in some areas , sex ratios reached as high as 120 boys for every 100 girls for the second child of families			0
dr @entity185 of @entity186 , who checked the figures calculated by @entity188 , said : ‘ there is strong evidence that the overall gender ratio is significantly different from the background ratio among children in the @entity3 whose parents were born in @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197			0
a ‘ conservative estimate ’ for the number of missing girls was 1,400 to 4,722 , he added			0
gender selective abortion was ‘ the only readily available explanation ’ for the observed gender shift .			0

doctors only meet patients in 46 per cent of abortion cases , figures reveal
women interviewed by less - qualified nurses , before doctors sign forms
under @entity9 , two doctors must *separately* agree to abortion
they must decide ' in good faith ' that it would be in woman *'s* best interests
