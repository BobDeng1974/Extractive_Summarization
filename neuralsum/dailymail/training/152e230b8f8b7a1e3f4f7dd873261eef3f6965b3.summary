by @entity0 a replica village , complete with shops , a post office and a village green , has been built to help dementia sufferers who are ' stuck in the past '			1
staff at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , came up with the quirky idea when they noticed that residents with dementia took comfort in completing everyday tasks and activities that felt familiar			1
the village boasts a butcher 's , bakery , greengrocer 's , sweet shop , haberdashery and post office , all designed to look like shops from the 1950s - when many of the residents were young adults			1
memory lane : the village at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 has a post office , sweet shop and greengrocers , which have been built around a small green where the staff planted flowers and bushes daily chores : @entity7 have also left half - finished tasks , like this washing that needs hanging up , around the centre to help residents who suffer from dementia it also has a railway and bus station - complete with a waiting room and suitcases - all built around a village green			1
the idea was to create a space that felt familiar to residents with dementia , who often have better long - term memory than short - term			2
it gives them somewhere to carry out everyday tasks that they might miss , or chores that they feel they need to complete - such as picking up some milk or hanging up the washing			0
this sense of purpose can keep sufferers calm and help alleviate the distress and confusion they can often feel			1
one resident spends a lot of time sitting on the bench in the station waiting room - which staff said reminded him of journeys he used to take as a boy			2
@entity81 , manager of the centre , said : ' the village gives the residents the ability to have a normal life with meaningful engagements rather than just activities which fill in time			2
familiar feeling : the shopfronts have all been designed based on how they would have looked in the 1950s - around the time when many of the residents were young adults place to relax : residents helped decorate the village green with homemade bunting			1
this sense of purpose that it offers residents can help alleviate the distress and confusion dementia sufferers can often feel ' it 's important for them to be busy and have a purpose			1
' often they say , " i need to go to the shops " , so we created the shopping village			2
' in the middle of the village we have created a park where we have planted some flowers and bushes so people feel like they 've gone to the park to feed the ducks			0
' the village is not the first idea the carers have come up with to make their residents feel more comfortable			0
they also place half - finished chores around the house so if residents forget what they are doing they are able to assume they were planning to take up the activity			0
comforting : one of the rooms inside has been transformed into a train station waiting room			1
@entity7 said that one man spends a lot of time sitting on one of the benches as it reminds him of journeys he took as a child at the top of the stairs rests a pile of half - finished knitting , so if a resident forgets on the way upstairs what they wanted to do there is a task waiting for them			0
@entity150 , who runs the care home for its 53 residents , said : ' we are always trying to think of new and innovative ideas to help them			0
' they live for the moment and just having simple tasks , such as going to the shop or waiting for a train , is a simple idea but is very relevant to how they lived and has a calming and soothing effect			1
' just giving them a pram or a washing line which would n't be available in other homes helps them do something they remember			0
' it 's been an ongoing process but it has already made a huge difference to even our more challenging residents			0
' they even helped make the village by putting up bunting			0
' they have much better long term memories than short term and it really helps those that may be stuck in the past			0
