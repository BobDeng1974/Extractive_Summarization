the message from @entity1 was simple			1
amid all the chatter about contracts , playing time and the future , his thoughts on @entity3 could be boiled down to two words : do n’t go			1
@entity15 ’s captain might not be the rampaging , goalscoring force of nature of 10 years ago but , to his manager , @entity3 ’s importance to the club , the help he provides and the example he sets every day at @entity13 can not be stressed enough			1
@entity20 is not the kind of relationship @entity22 and @entity25 share at @entity26			0
@entity3 is n’t having an unexpected indian summer like his old @entity29 colleague and does n’t have the assistance of an assortment of @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity35 winners			1
@entity15 manager @entity1 left @entity3 on the bench for saturday 's game against @entity38 the captain was on the pitch when the winner was scored by @entity42 five minutes from time @entity3 applauds the fans as they chant his name after his side 's 1 - 0 win over @entity38 @entity42 strikes late with a header to give his side a much - needed 1 - 0 victory at @entity51 many comparisons have been made recently about how @entity3 could do for @entity15 what @entity25 has been doing for @entity26 but when the subject was broached yesterday morning at @entity13 , @entity1 ’ answer was as robust as it was significant			1
for @entity22 , @entity57 is a bonus			0
by contrast , @entity3 remains @entity1 ’ most trusted lieutenant			1
if he does not take up the offer of extending what has been a lifelong association with @entity15 , the issues will not be easily solved			2
‘ @entity3 is a man in his own right and incomparable with most , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ @entity15 and @entity26 are different			2
they have totally different squads and different ideas of working			0
@entity3 ’s own situation is also different			2
@entity1 ( left ) has a frank discussion with @entity3 during @entity15 's clash with @entity70 in september @entity1			1
however , is keen to retain the 34 - year - old @entity15 veteran as a central figure at the club @entity22 ( right ) has been boosted by @entity25 's superb form since his loan move fomer @entity76 legend @entity25 ( left ) is having an @entity77 since his short - term move to @entity26 ‘ i certainly wo n’t be retiring this summer			1
i will play beyond this season			0
we will have to wait and see whether that ’s at @entity15 or somewhere else			2
that ’s @entity15 ’s decision			2
if they do n’t come then i will see what ’s out there			0
’ - from @entity86 's exclusive interview ‘ he ’s had 16 incredible years here and i believe he can continue to work at this level for the next couple of years			1
but there are other factors involved that are as much about life as they are about football			0
one thing i know absolutely is that it is not about money			0
‘ i ’m sure in time @entity3 will talk through the things he had to consider			2
but , for me , there is no drama			0
it is about managing a player who i have always admired and admire even more after having the chance to work with him , as a player and a person			0
i ’ll manage that to the best of my ability and the calls i make will always be for the best of the team			0
i have a huge respect for @entity3 in terms of what he has done as a player and what he has done for me in my time here			2
’ @entity1 , undoubtedly , believes @entity15 are a better team when @entity3 is included and his keenness for the 34 - year - old to stay on beyond this campaign needs little explanation : where else would he find a player on the open market to slip straight into his boots ? @entity3 was instrumental in @entity15 's late charge in last season 's title race but his costly slip against @entity76 allowed @entity128 to score and steal victory at @entity51 , from which they never recovered @entity3 ( left ) was left on the bench by @entity1 for @entity15 's clash with @entity133 at the @entity134 ‘ to captain this club for the length of time he has and to take on the ambassadorial role like he has , is incredible , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ for me , there will always be a position for @entity3 here as a player			2
if he ever went away , i ’m sure there will be a time later on where there will be a role for him back here			0
‘ he is a unique guy who is a proper legend of this football club			0
i want him to be here , but there is thinking time needed			0
’ contrary to some reports circling at the weekend , the bond between @entity1 and @entity3 , who started on the bench for the 1 - 0 win over @entity38 on saturday , is strong			1
@entity3 ( left ) is no longer the player that drove @entity15 to @entity33 glory in @entity160 in 2005 the @entity15 midfielder is no longer able to run himself to a standstill as a he did in the 2006 @entity164 final the 2014 version of @entity3 does not run himself to a standstill like the buccaneer who lit up @entity160 ( 2005 ) and @entity169 ( 2006 ) but that does not mean he is n’t as effective			1
there will have to be some tweaks to how he is deployed but @entity1 is in no mood to dispense with him			0
‘ for any player that ( mental adjustment ) is something that needs to be considered , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ you get to a stage where you ca n’t play every minute of every game			0
it is interesting when we have three games in a week i get asked : “ is he capable of playing three games ? ” ‘ but the minute he is not played in one game i am asked : “ why is n’t he playing ? ” with @entity3 , he is getting to that point of his career and he will speak about the adjustments he needs to make			1
in time he will make the decision for his career			0

@entity3 was benched for @entity15 's recent 1 - 0 win over @entity38
@entity3 , however , remains @entity1 ’ most trusted lieutenant
@entity15 manager is keen for @entity3 to stay beyond *current* season
@entity3 is on *£* *140,000* a week but owners not willing to match that
@entity3 told @entity202 he would not be retiring this summer
