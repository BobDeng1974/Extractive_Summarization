by @entity0 last updated at 6:42 pm on 27th february 2012 a defiant @entity1 hit back against accusations that he is a rich guy out - of - touch with ordinary people ’s concerns by saying he does n’t think ‘ anyone could care less ’ about how many cars he owns			1
in an interview with 610 @entity9 radio in @entity10 , @entity1 , who was lambasted last week for casually mentioning that his wife @entity14 ‘ drives a couple of @entity13 ’ , bristled at the suggestion that the number of vehicles his family owned was of any relevance and doubled down on his previous statement			1
speaking from @entity22 , he said : ‘ i do n't think anyone here could care less			0
a month ago , i was asked what cars do we own			0
couple : @entity1 , arrives on stage with his wife @entity14 to speak at a rally in @entity30 , @entity22 , on sunday ‘ i pointed out that we had a @entity32 , a @entity34 truck and @entity14 has a @entity13 and then we have a second car that we have at our second home , that 's a @entity13 that she keeps that she did n’t turn in when she bought the new one			1
’ asked how he felt when people attacked him for having ‘ a lot more money in some cases than a lot of @entity43 ’ , mr @entity1 responded : ‘ i ’m not going to apologise for being successful			1
‘ in fact one of the reasons i ’m in this race is that i believe that my experience in the private sector having competed around the world enables me to know what it takes to get @entity43 working again and to bring good jobs back to this country			2
’ meanwhile , two days away from tuesday 's critical primary in @entity22 , mr @entity1 detoured to @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57 , for the @entity59 race on sunday			1
he visited the track for a few hours before the scheduled start of the @entity62 , spoke briefly at the pre-race drivers ' meeting and spent time walking around the garage and pit areas			1
mr @entity1 was introduced at the drivers ' meeting and received hearty applause from drivers , team members and other vips			1
‘ this combines a couple of things i like best - cars and sports , ’ he said			2
rainy day : mr @entity1 , second from right , poses with fans before the @entity59 @entity62 @entity80 auto race at @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57 , on sunday mates : mr @entity1 , second from left , poses with @entity83 star @entity84 , second from right , and @entity87 @entity86 football players @entity88 , left , and @entity89 , right , before the @entity59 race ‘ i appreciate the spirit of the men and women that are driving today			1
this is a chance to really look at some of the determination and great qualities of the human spirit			0
' i pointed out that we had a @entity32 , a @entity34 truck and @entity14 has a @entity13 and then we have a second car that we have at our second home , that 's a @entity13 that she keeps that she did n’t turn in when she bought the new one ' @entity1 ‘ this is quintessentially @entity43			1
i love what you 're doing , happy to be here today , wish you all the very best and @entity108 bless this great nation of ours			0
’ mr @entity1 acknowledged that he is n't necessarily a hard - core fan but has a working knowledge of the sport and friendships with some of the people involved in racing			2
' i have some great friends who are @entity59 team owners , ' he said			1
with a campaign event scheduled in @entity22 later on sunday , mr @entity1 was n't scheduled to stay for the race - just as well , because it was postponed until monday by rain			1
mr @entity1 has also indicated he is confident of winning in @entity10 , which votes on super tuesday - march 6th - and where his main rival @entity122 is currently leading in the polls			2
‘ 10 days ago i was 15 points behind in @entity22			0
today i ’m up slightly in @entity22			0
i expect to be able to do the same thing in @entity10			0
’ supporters : mr @entity1 signs autographs for fans as he visits @entity55 before the @entity59 @entity62 @entity80 auto race in @entity56 , @entity57 , on sunday @entity1 rival : @entity131 presidential candidate @entity122 , left , with his daughter , @entity132 , right , speaks to supporters during a campaign rally on sunday in @entity135 , @entity22 mr @entity122 showed no signs of letting up on mr @entity1 , stating that by introducing ‘ @entity139 lite ’ in @entity137 he had rendered himself ‘ uniquely unqualified ’ to take on president @entity140			1
‘ i believe in markets , i believe in free people , ’ he told a @entity142 breakfast in @entity143 , @entity22			2
' one of the reasons i ’m in this race is that i believe that my experience in the private sector having competed around the world enables me to know what it takes to get @entity43 working again and to bring good jobs back to this country ' @entity1 ‘ i do n’t believe in government telling us what to do			2
we need someone like that running against @entity140 , not someone who did “ @entity139 lite ”			0
‘ in @entity22 , why would we give this issue away ? it is the biggest issue in this race			0
it 's about government control of your economic lives , regulating you , taxing you , forcing you to buy things , then forcing their values on you and your religion			0
‘ which , by the way , governor @entity1 did in @entity176 hospitals in @entity137 by forcing them to distribute the morning after pill			2
‘ why is it we give those issues away in the general election ? at the core of what 's at stake in this country			0
why do we put someone up there who 's uniquely unqualified to make that case ? ’ additional reporting by @entity190			0
