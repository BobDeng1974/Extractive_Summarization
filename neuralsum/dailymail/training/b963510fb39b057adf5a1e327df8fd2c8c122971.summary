' @entity69 , director of @entity13 ( pictured ) calls the partnership ' truly historic ' nutritionist @entity97 investigates the most popular types of tea and gives them a health rating out of five			1
oolong tea oolong tea cuppa quota : 1 - 2 cups daily			2
health rating : 4/5 a cross between green and black tea , this partially fermented variety has a light , delicate flavour often likened to peaches			2
@entity112 , it has almost as much antioxidant power as the better known green tea , so drinking it regularly will help to boost your defences against heart disease and cancer			2
@entity121 researchers found that exposing human stomach cancer cells to an extract of oolong tea stimulated an increase in tumour cell destruction			0
drink it after a meal as a digestive aid , or after alcohol as a protection against a hangover			0
@entity133 is a scented oolong tea with the same health properties , prepared by piling jasmine flowers next to dried green leaves so they absorb the fragrance			0
breakfast tea cuppa quota : 1 - 2 cups daily			0
any type of black tea is better not drunk with meals because it can reduce iron absorption			0
health rating : 4/5 black ( fermented ) tea supplies 75 per cent of the @entity23 population 's intake of dietary flavonoids - antioxidants which reduce blood - clotting and the deposition of cholesterol in blood vessels			1
breakfast blends are among the best contributors because they contain a traditionally strong mixture of @entity161 @entity159 and @entity160 varieties			0
results from one study suggest that higher intake of flavonoids protect against coronary heart disease			0
breakfast tea provides more stimulant properties than other teas , but not the harsh jolt of coffee because the caffeine it contains is quite poorly absorbed			0
ordinary teabags are also one of the largest providers of fluoride in our diets - on average , tea provides up to 70 per cent of our total intake of this mineral , which can help in reducing tooth decay			1
green tea early grey tea cuppa quota : 3 - 4 cups daily			0
health rating : 3/4 its delicate flavour comes from added bergamot ( a type of citrus fruit ) which , according to traditional herbal medicine , helps protect against colds and chest infections			0
a favourite time to drink a cup of fragrant @entity198 is after eating , when it can help to digest a fatty meal			0
essential oils in tea aid digestion by encouraging digestive enzyme production			0
however , @entity198 's more delicate flavour means it has a lower content of disease protective antioxidants			1
green tea cuppa quota : around a mugful daily			0
health rating : 5/5 green tea has half the caffeine content of black tea , and laboratory tests suggest it has an even higher antioxidant activity			0
the growth of cancer cells isolated from the lung , breast and stomach can be inhibited by incubation with epigallocatechin gallate , one of green tea 's active ingredients			1
and research suggests that regular consumption may help prevent prostate cancer deaths			0
green tea also seems to stimulate beneficial gut bacteria called @entity231 , which help keep gastric infections at bay and maintain digestive health			0
it seems about half a pint of green tea is needed daily to exert these beneficial effects .			0

the teabags will be supplied by @entity13 estate near @entity14 , @entity0
brews are sold in @entity80 and @entity243 and the @entity82
