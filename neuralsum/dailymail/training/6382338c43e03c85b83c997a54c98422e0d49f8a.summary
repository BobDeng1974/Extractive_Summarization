it seems to be a question of when rather than if @entity2 win the @entity3 this season , and @entity5 sports predict they will wrap up the title on may 2			1
the world leaders in sports analytic technology calculate the percentage probabilities for league finishes using their match analysis , with @entity14 's side final points total projected at 90			1
their previous annual predictions had @entity16 winning the league but the reigning champions are now expected to finish eight points behind @entity2 , with @entity20 and @entity21 completing the top four			1
somewhat surprisingly , @entity2 's closest rivals at present , @entity72 , are tipped to come eighth , 13 points outside the @entity48 places , with a 2.2 per cent chance of finishing fourth or above			1
that is because @entity74 's in - form @entity72 have yet to face any several so called ' bigger ' sides , such as @entity33 ' projected top four			2
things are n't looking good for @entity78 and @entity21 at present , but they are expected to qualify for the @entity48 for an 18th time in a row , in what could be a tense final day of the season			0
the data has just seven points separating the @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 , while @entity89 are tipped to finish in 11th despite their fine start to the season			2
it could be an unsuccessful season for the @entity3 newcomers , with @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 pictured in the graphic finishing in the relegation zone			1
they all currently occupy the bottom three places			0
however , @entity101 , @entity66 and @entity102 could also threaten those spots with a relegation percentage above 20			0
@entity72 are @entity2 's nearest challengers this season but have a 2.2 per cent chance of a top four finish @entity78 ( left , @entity21 ) and @entity109 ( r , @entity86 ) could battle for a @entity48 place it could be another sorry top - flight season for @entity95 , who are predicted to go down under @entity113 @entity2 replicating @entity21 's ' @entity115 ' season has been mentioned , with @entity14 's men still unbeaten in the league			1
and while @entity33 may not be able to predict such astonishing feats , perhaps it would be best to pencil in the fixture against @entity66 at the beginning of may			2
it may be time to witness another @entity126 title party			0
