by @entity0 published : 10:34 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 11:38 est , 15 october 2012 is there any escape from all those political ads in the most hotly contested states in the three weeks before the presidential election ? the tv ads come in rapid succession and at all hours — in the middle of newscasts , soap operas and talk shows			1
they cover everything from jobs to education to trust , and they 're sharply negative			1
it 's all enough to turn off voters , leaving them frustrated and annoyed			1
hoping for the vote : @entity22 and @entity23 have raised millions - both personally and via political action committees - to spend on television ads throughout the presidential campaign ' it 's just way too much , ' says scot @entity28 , a history professor at the @entity31			1
he lives along the swing - voting @entity33 corridor that will play an important role in deciding whether president @entity23 or @entity22 wins the state , and perhaps the @entity36			1
mr @entity37 is quick to criticize both political parties , calling the homestretch advertising deluge ' a game of sowing confusion among those who are confusable			1
' this is the risk facing the candidates and their allies as they spend huge sums of money before the november 6 vote			1
it 's a risk that both sides are willing to take , given that polls show the race remains close nationally and in the most competitive states such as @entity54			1
by the end , the campaigns and independent groups will have spent about $ 1.1billion on television advertising this year , with $ 750million already allocated in the handful of states likely to determine the outcome of the contest — @entity64 , @entity54 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 , the @entity63 estimates			1
@entity54 tops the list , with more than $ 150million spent by both sides so far			1
personal appeals : the president spent the weekend in @entity69 while preparing for tuesday 's debate , and stopped in a field office to answer phones with a volunteer at least some voters tuned out long ago : in interviews last week , many cited the negativity and lack of specifics in the commercials ; others said they had already decided which candidate to support and did n't need to be persuaded			1
indeed , many of the commercials at this late stage are aimed at those voters who have not yet locked in on their selection			2
the target audience includes people such as @entity94 , a stay - at - home mom from @entity95			2
but ms @entity94 , 40 , says she pays no attention to the ads and will rely on other sources of information to make up her mind			2
' the ads i just find entertaining			2
the debates and what i read about are going to affect my decision			2
i need to know where the candidates stand , ’ she said			2
there 's no doubt that tv advertising has the power to shift voter perceptions , particularly when a candidate is not well known			2
swing states : @entity22 has spent much time in @entity68 , which is repeating its frequent role as a pivotal swing state @entity22 prevailed in the @entity120 primaries after he and his allies buried his two main rivals with negative advertising in early voting states			1
@entity23 's team tagged @entity22 as a ruthless corporate raider with a flood of negative advertising in the early stages of the general election			1
the ads may have shaped perceptions in states such as @entity68 , where @entity23 has held a narrow lead in polling for weeks			1
even so , the unprecedented level of spending this year on ads has n't changed many minds , according to one analyst			2
' there 's not much bang for the buck , ' says @entity142 , a political science professor at @entity143 who studies presidential campaign advertising			0
' the public is pretty much set on who they will vote for and only a tiny slice is up for grabs			0
' that was the finding of his @entity152 project , which screens political commercials with representative sample of 600 voters , including an oversample of 200 swing voters , who judge them for their fairness , believability and emotional reactions			1
few ads , he said , really ' move the dials			0
' not that the candidates and their backers are n't trying their best to do just that			0
in the final weeks , @entity23 's team is running an ad warning that @entity22 would cut @entity172 money for nursing home care			0
' we have a president who wo n't let that happen , ' the ad says			0
@entity22 primarily is running a spot in which he promises to boost the economy through manufacturing , energy and cracking down on @entity182			0
' let me tell you how i will create 12 million jobs when president @entity23 could n't , ' @entity22 says			0
risky : by bombarding voters with campaign ads , the candidates run the risk of creating a negative feeling and prompting them to avoid voting all together both sides are being buffeted by independent groups			0
@entity22 is getting a big assist from two super political action committees , @entity197 and @entity198			0
the @entity199 is running an ad saying @entity22 would cut early childhood education if elected			0
among those who are n't watching is @entity203 , a 67 - year - old @entity23 supporter from @entity204			0
he said he tuned out the ads months ago			0
' everyone i know has already made up their mind			0
the ads are kind of annoying , ' he said			0
' it 's a shame to see so much money being spent			1
' on the other side is @entity214 , also of @entity204			0
the 33 - year - old stay - at - home mom said she always planned to support @entity22 and that his ads made her ' more enthusiastic ' about doing so			0
one particular @entity23 ad stuck out to her : the ad assailing @entity22 's pledge to end federal support of public television and the @entity223 character @entity222			1
even though she 's a fan of public tv , she says that ad wo n't affect her vote .			0

campaigns will have spent $ 1.1billion by end of election on november 6
$ 750million dedicated to swing states of @entity54 , @entity70 , @entity68 , @entity65 , @entity69 , @entity67 , @entity66 , @entity64
