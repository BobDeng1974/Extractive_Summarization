by @entity0 published : 08:33 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 08:33 est , 27 september 2013 a mystery graffiti artist has been making ' @entity2 ' signs a little more accessible - by adding their own flourishes to the plain red and white design			1
in @entity5 , @entity6 , and in @entity9 , the silhouette of a man has been painted on in a series of comedy poses - and brightening up the view for passers - by			1
in one picture , the man has his hands and head put through holes in the white bar , as if he were in the stocks			2
laughing stocks : the silhouette of a man being pilloried was painted onto this ' no entry ' sign along @entity25 in south west @entity9 in another , the man cuts the white bar in half with a saw like a carpenter sawing a plank of wood			1
a third shows the silhouette of a man carrying the bar under his arm as he walks along the roundel of the sign			2
and yet another example takes a romantic turn , as the stick man hugs the white bar - complete with little red hearts to match the red background			2
no one has any idea as to the identity of the artist , or why he might have made the additions to the signs			2
the artist known as @entity53 is the best - known ' underground ' graffiti artist , whose works can be found in @entity9 , @entity55 and across the world - and like the ' @entity2 ' artist , his real identity is still unconfirmed			1
many stealth graffiti artists often take their inspiration from ' @entity61 ' - real name @entity62 - who began stenciling images including rats and ballerinas on the walls of @entity68 in the 1980s , and who is credited as being one of the first graffiti artists to be recognised as more than simply a vandal			0
cutting edge : another sign on @entity25 shows the black stick man sawing the white stop bar in half heavy lifting : a silhouette of a man in @entity81 in @entity6 lugs the stop bar across the red background of the sign in this artistic piece of vandalism graffiti ' art ' is still a subject of controversy			1
in 2009 , a @entity53 work parodying the @entity92 was partially removed from a wall in @entity94 , east @entity9 , after the council served an enforcement notice for graffiti removal to the property owner			0
but there have as yet been no suggestions that these new installations will be removed			0
and while the stop signs are nowhere near as widespread or as highly regarded as @entity53 and @entity104 's creations , passers - by who have spotted them admit they have given them a reason to smile			1
one @entity6 local said : ' it 's highly amusing			0
those sort of signs are things you see dozens of times a day , and , to be honest , they 're pretty boring to look at			0
' the silhouette signs have received rave reviews on @entity117			0
@entity118 wrote : ' @entity119 ever			0
' @entity120 tweeted : ' very cool designer - no - entry sign in @entity81			0
' stop signs are red ... love is in the air in @entity9 's @entity25 thanks to the design by the unknown grafitti artist on this road sign			1
