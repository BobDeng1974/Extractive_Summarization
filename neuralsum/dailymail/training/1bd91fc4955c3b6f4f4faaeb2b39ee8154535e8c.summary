by @entity0 published : 19:03 est , 25 august 2013 updated : 11:02 est , 26 august 2013 warning : chief rabbi @entity1 said society was failing to protect institutions such as marriage @entity5 is ‘ losing the plot ’ as it becomes more secular and less trusting , the chief rabbi has warned			1
@entity1 , who retires on sunday , said society was failing to protect institutions such as marriage – with grave consequences			1
‘ i think we ’re losing the plot actually , ’ he said			2
‘ i think we have n’t really noticed what ’s happened in @entity5			0
‘ when you begin to lose faith and society becomes very , very secularised , you see a breakdown of institutions , whether they are financial or economic , or marriage as an institution			1
' then you ask “ why have they broken down ? ” , and you arrive at one word , which is trust			0
’ last week @entity1 warned that the government had ‘ not done enough ’ to support marriage			1
he urged ministers to finally introduce a promised tax break for married couples , and said mothers who stayed at home to raise their children deserved more recognition			0
however , yesterday he added that politicians were only partly responsible for the decline of marriage			1
he claimed the permissive attitudes of the @entity38 had left marriage in ‘ disarray ’ and children worse - off			1
‘ it ’s not the fault of one government or another , and it ’s not even the fault of government , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s the fault of what we call culture , which is society talking to itself			2
’ new man : lord @entity1 will soon be succeeded by @entity56 ( pictured ) , the former chief rabbi of @entity57 of the @entity38 , he said : ‘ we were in that revolution , and at the time it seemed to be “ all you need is love ” and nothing else			1
' we live to see , 50 years later , the full cost of that ... child poverty that has a lot to do with single - parent families			0
the internet is fuelling intolerance and hatred , according to @entity1			2
he said he has grown increasingly alarmed by how hate - filled material can be spread on social networks with apparent impunity			0
the chief rabbi , who will continue to campaign on the issue after he retires next week , said the law should be extended to force internet service providers and the owners of social networks and other websites to remove material that would otherwise be classed as ‘ hate speech ’			1
he said : ‘ it ’s very difficult , but they do have to be vigilant , and they have to take hate speech off their websites as soon as they discover it			0
’ he stressed that he was not against new technology – @entity1 has his own @entity93 and @entity94 accounts – but highlighted the damaging effects of the anonymity available online			2
‘ we are worried about the social media because you can post abusive comments without the person being in your physical presence , ’ he said			0
‘ that anonymity and that distance mean that the internet is one of the great carriers of prejudice and paranoia , and i do n’t take it lightly			0
’ lord @entity1 also said he remains opposed to gay marriage - but warned against ‘ whipping up prejudice ’ against homosexuals			1
‘ no - one wants to lay a burden of guilt on anyone who bought into the cultural attitudes of the @entity38 , but the fact is , their kids are suffering			1
’ @entity1 , who has been chief rabbi for 22 years , lamented the rise of selfishness , and called on politicians to work with faith groups to create a more caring country			1
‘ individualism is no way to build a society , ’ he said			2
‘ if people work for the maximum possible benefit for themselves then we will not have trust in industry , in economics , in financial institutions ; we will not see marriages last			2
’ in wide - ranging interviews to mark his retirement , he also called for the government to act now to tackle the housing crisis			0
he said it was ‘ morally unacceptable ’ that many youngsters were no longer able to afford a home in the town where they work			0
however , despite his warnings , he insisted he is ‘ full of hope ’ for the future – not least because of the popularity of faith schools			0
he said many people shared his concerns about society , adding : ‘ it is why so many non-believing parents send their children to faith schools – they want their children to grow up with a strong moral sense			2
’ lord @entity1 – who will be succeeded by @entity56 , former chief rabbi of @entity57 – also called for more action to tackle the persecution of @entity162 minorities in the @entity163			1
‘ this is a story which is crying out for a public voice , ’ he said .			0
