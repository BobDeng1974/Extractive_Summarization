everyone who owns a home worth £ 1 million or more will be targeted in a new ‘ anti-affluence ’ crackdown by the @entity4			1
a beefed - up squad of computer and legal experts will pore over their property , savings and income			0
if they think the individual is not paying enough tax , they will have the power to knock on their front door and force them to account for every penny			2
the move is part of a tax - dodging purge on the rich forced through by deputy prime minister @entity23			1
in an exclusive interview with this newspaper , mr @entity25 , one of the @entity4 ’s all - powerful ‘ @entity34 ’ with @entity35 , @entity36 and mr @entity23 , vowed to ‘ sniff out ’ wealthy tax cheats			1
‘ the measure will apply to people with homes and assets of more than £ 1 million , ’ he said			1
he denied it showed the @entity27 were against successful hard - working people who made money , but insisted the well - off had to dig deeper to help clear the @entity47 ’s debts , saying : ‘ the wealthiest did best in the boom years and it is right they should pay more now			1
’ he is boosting @entity52 ’ 200 - strong orwellian - sounding @entity53 , set up to probe 300,000 people worth more than £ 2.5 million – and widening its net			1
the @entity53 ’s strength will rise to 300 as its range is extended to include 500,000 people worth more than £ 1 million			1
mr @entity25 said : ‘ we will use it software to look across files and records and work out features in someone ’s affairs that suggest there ’s avoidance going on			0
they will look at anomalies and sniff out any problems			0
’ an @entity52 source said it would ‘ target affluent individuals owning offshore property ’ , develop a ‘ serial avoiders unit ’ to tackle avoidance , and ‘ undertake a range of interventions to change the long - term behaviour of those using avoidance products ’			2
mr @entity25 said he and mr @entity23 would love to go further and impose a mansion tax on homes worth over £ 2 million , arguing it is the hardest kind of wealth tax to avoid			1
‘ you can not dodge it – a home is not something you can shuffle off to @entity89 , ’ he said			0
' anti-affluence ' : anybody who owns a home worth £ 1million or more will come under extra scrutiny mr @entity35 has refused point blank to back the mansion tax , or a similar ‘ tycoon tax ’ put forward by mr @entity23			1
as a result , the @entity27 are threatening to refuse to support @entity99 plans for a new round of public spending cuts in another clash that threatens to wreck the @entity4			0
however , some @entity99 may feel mr @entity23 has got round mr @entity35 by using the new probe into people with £ 1 million homes as a ‘ back - door mansion tax ’			1
when it was pointed out that mr @entity35 and mr @entity36 would lose out from a mansion tax because they both own property worth well over £ 2 million , mr @entity25 – a lowly press officer with @entity111 before he became an mp and mr @entity36 ’s deputy – declared : ‘ well i do n’t ! ’ ' the measures will apply to people with homes and assets of more than £ 1m ' treasury chief secretary @entity25 asked how much he is worth , he replied : ‘ i have a two - bedroom flat in @entity119 worth £ 300,000 to £ 400,000 and a home in @entity121 worth a bit less			1
’ he did not conceal tensions in the @entity4 over the @entity27 ‘ squeeze the rich ’ tax crackdown , saying pointedly : ‘ @entity36 is always saying , “ we ’re all in this together ”			2
’ critics are bound to point out that mr @entity25 was at the centre of a tax furore of his own in the @entity130 ’ expenses scandal			0
support : mr @entity25 's plan was reinforced by @entity23 at the @entity27 conference in @entity135 he admitted using a loophole to legally avoid paying @entity137 by designating his @entity119 property as his second home for his mps ’ expenses – but described it to the @entity52 as his main home			1
under his initiative , wealthy @entity145 stars could also receive a visit by @entity52 investigators			2
he is furious at the @entity150 ’s failure to copy @entity152 ’s lead in stopping top civil servants slashing their tax bill by being paid via a private company			0
he has written to @entity145 boss mr @entity156 demanding action			2
‘ the only part of the public sector that did not follow our example was the @entity145 , ’ he said			0
‘ i will be writing to the new director general saying @entity145 employees must be paid openly and transparently			2
’ @entity150 has admitted paying ‘ up to 3,000 ’ actors , editors , make - up artists and other ‘ craft staff ’ through service companies – with 36 earning more than £ 100,000 – but has refused to reveal how many top names were paid this way			2
presenters @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 were reportedly among those who set up companies to channel their earnings			0
@entity178 soccer stars will also have their tax affairs scrutinised			0
‘ i am not ascribing any particular moral characteristics to footballers , ’ said mr @entity25			0
‘ but experts will identify warning signs , make sure their tax affairs are in order and approach the individual and “ have a conversation ” if they are n’t			0
’ @entity52 has already ‘ had a conversation ’ with several @entity190 stars , leading them to be forced to pay up to £ 100,000 each in tax ‘ fines ’ – and the number will rise with the new purge			1
mr @entity25 ’s plan was reinforced by mr @entity23 as he arrived at the @entity27 conference in @entity135 last night			0
he said : ‘ it ’s wrong that people on low and middle incomes who work hard and play by the rules are taxed so much while @entity203 oligarchs pay the same council tax as some do on a family home			0

owners of homes worth £ 1m or more will come under scrutiny as part of @entity4 's new ' anti-affluence ' crackdown
@entity52 will have power to force those deemed to be paying too little tax to account for every penny
part of a tax - dodging purge on the rich forced through by deputy *pm* @entity23
@entity25 : ' the wealthiest did best in the boom years and it is right they should pay more now '
half a million people with property and assets worth over £ 1 million will come under extra scrutiny to make sure they are not cheating the taxman .
the *government* is to order new @entity145 director general @entity156 to stop its *celebrities* and *executives* using tax avoidance ploys .
soccer players and managers who dodge tax face fines of up to £ 100,000 .
