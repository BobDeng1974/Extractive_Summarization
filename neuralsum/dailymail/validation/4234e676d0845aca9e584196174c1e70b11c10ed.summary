ordinary people undergo road rage - like personality changes when using internet sites like @entity4 and @entity5 , a leading psychologist has warned ordinary people undergo road rage - like personality changes when using internet sites like @entity4 and @entity5 , a leading psychologist has warned			1
a dangerous combination of people feeling distanced from the person they are abusing and having a vast platform on which to vent anger instantly encourages users to become more aggressive			1
just as normally calm drivers sometimes lash out when they get frustrated behind the wheel , so ordinary people can become uncharacteristically angry on social media , said dr @entity20			1
the clinical director of @entity22 in central @entity23 said people using social media were less likely to feel empathy or compassion towards others			1
he spoke as a new poll found almost nine in ten @entity30 now admit to having lost their temper more quickly online than in real life			0
young people were the least tolerant			2
likening the phenomenon to road rage , dr @entity34 said : ' this research shows that , if anything , the online space seems to be robbing us of some of the most fundamental aspects of our humanity			2
' when using these sites , people are less likely to feel empathy , patience or compassion towards others ; they are significantly quicker to judge and more dangerously reactive in their anger			2
' the survey questioned 1,000 users of sites including @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 about whether their personality changes while reading and posting messages			0
some 84 per cent admitted they become more easily exasperated and enraged at others online than they ever would in person			0
young people are particularly prone to internet road rage , with 26 per cent of the 18 to 24 year olds surveyed saying they are ' always ' worked up when using social media , compared with 18 per cent of 35 to 44 year olds and just 11 per cent of those in the over- 55 age group			1
the survey , carried out by @entity70 for ' @entity72 ' social media site @entity73 , also revealed that many regret losing their temper online			1
some 35 per cent said they had posted a reply or comment or tweeted in anger , only to wish they had n't later			0
a similar proportion admitted being tempted to vent their rage but said they manage to control themselves			2
dr @entity34 said that like motorists , users of social websites feel protected behind their screens			1
they are also emboldened by the relative anonymity and the distance between them and the person they are being rude to			0
the survey questioned 1,000 users of sites including @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 about whether their personality changes while reading and posting messages			0
above , file image even the simple fact they are n't speaking out loud and so do n't hear what they are saying can make them more reckless			0
the psychologist , who would like some social media websites to carry warnings that they can make people more impulsive , said : ' the psychological damage we can cause to ourselves and others must undoubtedly be taken into account when interacting via social media			1
' just as we try to be calm ahead of a tense situation on the road , equally we should take a few breaths before posting messages or sending emails			0
' @entity120 , founder of @entity73 , which bans textspeak and encourages positive messages , said that people are clearly more antagonistic and judgemental on traditional social networking sites and ' now specialists even have a name for it '			2
@entity128 , a social media researcher at @entity129 , said that other research suggests the opposite is true			1
a recent study of @entity4 pages of people in southern @entity135 found that fewer than 10 per cent of comments were negative â€“ and even those used wit and irony to get their point across , rather than hate			0
professor @entity128 said : ' rage ' is mainly limited to teenage girls quarrelling with each other on @entity5 and some political ranting			0

social media users feel distanced from target of abuse , says psychologist
this is dangerous when combined with vast platform on which to vent rage
dr @entity20 warns it encourages people to be more aggressive
