he said : ' i bought the dvds at a good price for about £ 1 each about four months ago			1
' the idea was to sell them in small job lots of 100 for about £ 3 each , so traders could go on @entity53 , @entity54 , or car boot sales and sell them on			1
' there was a slight amount of risk and a gamble because there was a suspicion , but he was n't admitting to it , so i put them on the website last week			0
