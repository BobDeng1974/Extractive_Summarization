researcher also took a bone sample which will now be analysed a series of storms on @entity10 's @entity3 temporarily revealed what archaeologists believe could be a pair of 2,000 - year - old skeletons			1
police were initially called to the scene on december 16th when storms eroded a cliff at @entity19 , exposing the human remains			1
local archaeologist @entity21 said the ancient skeleton looked as if it were the same age as the remains of @entity25 structures revealed nearby			1
researchers then identified evidence of one or possibly two more burials at the site , but another storm caused a further chunk of the cliff to crumble , covering up the discovery			0
' the original burial now lies under several tons of fallen bank , and the @entity25 structures have also disappeared from view , ' @entity21 said			0
' however , a small piece of bone will be sent for radiocarbon dating and it will be possible to determine whether or not the remains are about 2,000 years old , as we suspect			1
' @entity43 added that during the investigation she and freelance colleague @entity45 discovered evidence of at least one , and possibly two other burials			0
@entity43 also told the @entity49 that the force 10 easterly storms on 16th december had damaged archaeological sites along the entire east coast of @entity3			1
in @entity55 as much as a metre has been lost of an @entity25 site at @entity57			0
and a @entity59 site above the beach at the @entity61 on @entity62 , originally excavated and consolidated by the @entity63 and @entity64 , has been partially lost to the sea			0
' we are fortunate to have a record of these sites as a result of earlier work but coastal erosion is an ever present feature of archaeology in @entity3 , ' she said			2
' @entity76 â€™s archaeology section would be keen to hear from anyone who knows of other sites which may have appeared or been eroded by the storms			2
' we are hoping that once we have an indication of just how great a problem has been created in the last few weeks , we will be able to formulate an action plan			0
' the area where the skeleton was found - after a landslide recovered the 2,000 year old human remains			1
