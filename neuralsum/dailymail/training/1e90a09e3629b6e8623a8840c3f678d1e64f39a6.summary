a report has suggested some of the @entity1 players may have been doped @entity1 's footballers who played in the 1966 @entity9 against @entity2 may have been injected with drugs as part of a government - funded doping scheme , a study has suggested			1
a report by @entity1 researchers claims that @entity1 's athletes were systematically doped with government backing during the 1970s , and possibly as early as the 1950s			1
leaked extracts from the unpublished 800 - page report titled ' doping in @entity1 from 1950 to today ' were published by @entity1 newspaper @entity22 on saturday			1
according to the report , one unnamed interior minister said at the time : ' our athletes should have the same conditions and services as the @entity31 athletes			1
' researchers said @entity1 doping did not evolve as a response to @entity36 's systematic doping under the @entity38 government , but operated parallel to it			1
the report claimed that for many years the state financed experiments with performance - enhancing substances such as anabolic steroids , testosterone , oestrogen or the blood - doping agent @entity49			1
it did not say when the experiments ended			0
it stated that an unspecified number of footballers in the 1954 @entity4 - winning team received ' @entity57 ' injections , which were actually the methamphetamine @entity58 - commonly known as speed			1
amphetamines were used by @entity1 soldiers during @entity63 and their continued use in @entity1 football from the end of the 1940s became ' normal ' , according to the study			2
as well as researchers finding alleged evidence of drugs being used by the 1954 @entity4 team , they also said ' traces ' of the banned stimulant ephedrine was found in three unnamed @entity1 players at the 1966 @entity4			1
but it was claimed the drug could have accidentally been taken when players used a decongestant for colds			2
three west @entity1 players were found to have traces of the banned stimulant ephedrine in tests after the 1966 final			1
( there is no suggestion that any players pictured knew about or were involved in doping ) @entity2 beat @entity1 4 - 2 in the final at @entity91 in 1966 @entity2 beat @entity1 4 - 2 in the final , with @entity93 scoring @entity2 's disputed third goal			1
@entity22 also said that @entity1 athletes received around 1,200 injections of @entity97 and thioctacid at the @entity98 in @entity99			2
the substances were not banned at the time and were supposed to improve performance , but their effects had been untested			0
women and children were also doped with anabolic steroids , despite concerns over their long - term effects , the report said			2
a dr @entity110 of @entity111 , who died in 2000 , allegedly tested the effects of anabolic steroids on boys as young as 11			0
the report was put together by researchers at @entity118 's @entity117 on behalf of the @entity1 @entity119 , with @entity120 as the project leader			1
it was completed in april , but has yet to be published because of privacy concerns and legal issues over naming athletes , doctors and politicians			0
@entity1 's @entity4 - winning 1954 team were injected with ' @entity57 ' which was actually speed , the report claimed			1
( there is no suggestion that any players pictured knew about or were involved in doping ) the report claimed the conditions for ' systemic doping ' were laid in 1970 when the @entity137 of @entity138 ( @entity139 ) was founded under jurisdiction of the @entity141 , which is still responsible for sports , but that doping in @entity1 existed long before			1
the @entity139 provided funding for research into doping substances for years , with sports medicine facilities in @entity111 , @entity149 and @entity150 among the main recipients , the report said			2
' there 's a systemic connection between research and forbidden substances and in using them for athletes , ' @entity120 , the project leader for the report , told @entity159			0
' that 's why we call it systemic doping			0
' the @entity141 said it has a ' great interest in completely clearing up and evaluating the doping past in both parts of @entity1 '			2
@entity1 @entity169 president @entity168 called for names to be revealed , ' especially of those who are still involved in sport '			2
last tuesday , the @entity174 and @entity175 newspapers reported that the @entity139 funded experiments in @entity111 on the performance of anabolic steroids before the 1972 @entity179 , citing a file from the @entity181 in @entity182			0
drugged : shot - putter @entity184 was systematically doped from the age of 16 @entity36 carried out a doping programme on its athletes for decades			1
drugs , largely anabolic steriods , were given to athletes , often without their knowledge			0
trainers and coaches gave pills and injections to sportsmen and women , many of whom were told they were just vitamins			0
the drugs caused fast muscle build - up and quick recovery times , leading to the country seeing huge success at the @entity179 of the 1970s and 80s and other international events			0
but the steroids had severe side - effects including causing heart problems , cancer and infertility			0
around 800 athletes are believed to have developed serious problems as a result of the doping			0
