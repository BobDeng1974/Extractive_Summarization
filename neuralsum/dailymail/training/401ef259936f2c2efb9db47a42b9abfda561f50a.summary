when dr @entity1 launched the @entity2 two years ago , he was confident that it was a great way to lose weight and improve health			1
but even he could not have been prepared for how the diet would take off , with hundreds of thousands of people around the globe successfully losing weight and transforming their vitality and wellbeing			2
while the basics have n’t changed — the aim is still to cut calories by three - quarters on two days of the week and eat normally the rest of the time — this week he and his co-author , @entity18 , launch an exciting new @entity2 book			1
in the book , dr @entity1 also explores the part exercise has to play in health , longevity and weight loss			1
do n’t worry , he ’s not suggesting you embark on a gruelling regime			1
you wo n’t have to join an expensive gym , either			2
the truth is that even if you do n’t exercise , you ’ll see many benefits from fasting two days a week			1
however , research shows that 12 minutes of exercise a week can significantly boost results			1
yes , that ’s right — just 12 minutes a week			1
and here , in the final part of our @entity2 series , we ’ll show you how to do it			1
in one study highlighted in the new book , participants were asked to combine 5:2 fasting with three short bursts of high - intensity training ( @entity64 ) on three separate days each week			1
the result was an average weight loss of 4.6kg ( 10lb ) over 12 weeks , all of it fat			1
one dieter on the programme lost an impressive 12.6kg ( 2st )			2
another study found that those who combined intermittent fasting with exercise ( 40 minutes three times a week ) lost twice as much over 12 weeks as those who only did the fasting			1
the good news is that you do n’t need to exercise for anything like 40 minutes to see benefits			1
exercising fast - style could n’t be simpler			2
forget running or cycling further , research shows that you gain the most benefit by increasing the intensity of your exercise , not the length of time that you do it			2
if you push yourself to the max for even a few seconds , there ’s no need — according to dr @entity1 — to exercise for very long at all			1
so whether you choose jogging , cycling , swimming or just trotting up and down a flight of stairs , think short , sharp bursts			2
push the intensity as much as you can for 20 ( building to 30 ) seconds , then slow the pace right down for a minute or so , and repeat			0
if you do it right , there ’s no need to be active for more than four minutes in total			2
find time for three of these mini-sessions each week , and you will be increasing the effectiveness of the diet and boosting your health			2
it does n’t matter whether you exercise on fast days or ordinary days , although studies show you will burn more fat if you exercise on a fast day			1
you may choose to build fast exercise into your ordinary fitness regime ( dr @entity1 builds sprints into his daily cycle home from work )			1
if that does n’t appeal , rest assured that you can get all the benefit you need in just a total of 12 minutes a week			1
start off with a couple of minutes of gentle pedalling , jogging or swimming			2
when you feel ready , speed up fast and work your body as hard as you can , maintain that intensity for 20 seconds , then slow down and allow your body to recover for a minute by returning to an easy pace			0
then repeat the intense ‘ sprint ’ for 20 seconds before slowing right down again until your heart rate has returned to normal			0
if you are very unfit or have never tried this sort of training before , slowly build up the sprints from two lots of ten seconds			0
then , once you have mastered two 20 - second sprints , add a third before your final cool - down			0
the whole ‘ workout ’ should take no longer than four minutes , and should be repeated three times a week			1
when you are comfortable with three 20 - second sprints , move up to 30 seconds of intense activity ( the extra ten seconds lasts a lot longer than you think )			0
start with two lots of 30 seconds and increase to three bursts of activity with a 1 - 2 minute recovery in between them			0
jogging if you are new to running , go for a brisk walk , breaking into a jog for your timed 20 or 30 - second ‘ sprint ’ intervals			0
as your stamina improves , your ‘ sprints ’ can be faster or done up hills to intensify the workout			0
just make sure you perform three sprints each time			0
if you are using a treadmill , put the machine at a permanent 1 per cent incline and increase the speed ( and incline ) as quickly as you can for each timed sprint			0
@entity165 climbing a great activity for bottom and leg toning which intensifies the health benefits of jogging by forcing your body to work against gravity			0
find a stairwell in a building with at least four full floors			0
ensure your whole foot lands on each step ( to avoid straining the @entity179 ’ tendon in the heel ) and walk back down during recovery periods			0
after a gentle warm - up ( walk up and down a couple of flights ) , sprint hard up the stairs as fast as you can for 20 ( building to 30 ) seconds , then slowly recover as you walk back down			0
cycling build intensity into the ride by intermittently switching to a higher gear and cycling very hard uphill for three 20 and then 30 - second bursts			0
freewheel back down between bursts to catch your breath			0
exercise bike spend a few minutes pedalling gently , then ramp up the @entity197 setting to 90 and pedal as hard and fast as you possibly can for 20 seconds before freewheeling for a few minutes to get your breath back			1
you can build @entity197 to 110 as you get stronger and increase the sprint times from 20 to 30 seconds			0
swimming challenge yourself to put three fast laps into your routine , but make sure you allow yourself time to catch your breath in between			0
a 25m length at full pelt is comparable to sprinting for around 30 - 40 seconds			0
