by @entity0 last updated at 1:52 pm on 15th february 2012 mps are set to visit the @entity2 next month amid simmering tension between @entity4 and @entity5 over ownership of the islands			1
in a move that could anger @entity11 still further , members of the @entity9 said they would be visiting the islands next month			1
they want to inspect @entity4 's military force there , which has recently been joined by the @entity13 on a six - week tour as a search and rescue pilot			2
fury : an @entity5 veteran from the 1982 conflict holds a flag as policemen try to disperse a protest in @entity11 yesterday amid rising tensions yesterday @entity23 was condemned as ‘ moronic ’ after he attacked @entity4 ’s ownership of the @entity2 following a meeting with the president of @entity5			1
the @entity28 actor and ex-husband of @entity30 , who is known for his left - wing views , said @entity4 ’s continuing hold on the islands was ‘ colonialist , ludicrous and archaic ’			2
despite having no previous knowledge or connection with the @entity2 – which he referred to as ‘ the @entity37 ’ – he called on @entity4 to relinquish them			0
the @entity9 visit comes ahead of the 30th anniversary of the conflict over the @entity2 , the @entity39 reported			1
fury : the @entity9 are planning their visit amid rising tensions			1
here a banner in @entity11 last week reads ' brits get out of the @entity37 ( @entity2 ) ' ' given that we have a significant military presence in the @entity2 ... it is only right that the defence committee goes and sees first - hand what taxpayers ' money is being spent on and what it is doing , ' committee member @entity47 said			0
' one of my priorities given the historic connection this year will be the anniversary			2
it is important this year that we recognise the sacrifices made			0
' an @entity5 war veterans spokesman described the visit as ' another provocation '			1
@entity66 , president of the association that represents @entity2 veterans , told @entity39 : ' @entity5 does not want war - it wants peace and the return of our islands through diplomatic negotiation			1
disputed territory : the @entity2 which a group of mps are planning to visit next month ' but the only thing that the @entity79 think about is war			1
we do n't want visitors from your parliament			0
' we want the @entity85 to intervene as it has done in disputes across the world			0
' there has been months of escalating rhetoric between @entity4 and @entity5			1
most recently , @entity5 has said it had intelligence that a @entity92 submarine had been sent to the area and demanded to know whether it was carrying warheads			1
' thus far the @entity4 refuses to say whether it is true or not , ' foreign minister @entity96 told a press conference			0
' are there nuclear weapons or are there not ? the information @entity5 has is that there are these nuclear weapons			2
' tensions : the @entity13 has been deployed on a six - week tour as a search and rescue pilot in the @entity2 - angering @entity5 mr @entity96 said @entity4 was using an ' unjustified defence of self - determination ' to maintain a military base on the @entity2 , which allowed it to dominate the @entity112			2
but @entity4 's ambassador to the @entity85 , sir @entity113 branded the idea that the @entity4 was ' militarising ' the situation ' manifestly absurd '			0
in recent months , prime minister @entity116 and president @entity117 have traded barbs prompting @entity85 secretary general @entity119 to issue a statement expressing ' concern about the increasingly strong exchanges '			0
tempers flared after @entity4 deployed one of its most modern destroyers , @entity126 , to the region , although it insisted the move was merely routine			0
the @entity13 's arrival in the @entity2 for a posting as an @entity132 search and rescue pilot has further infuriated @entity11			0
and there were protests after the website of @entity2 newspaper the @entity137 ran a photo of mrs @entity117 labelled ' bitch ' .			0
