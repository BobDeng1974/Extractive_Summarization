@entity1 manager @entity0 has hinted further that @entity2 is still likely to be in his squad next month			1
former @entity4 midfielder @entity2 has made a big impact at the @entity6 since signing on loan from sister club @entity8 and is expected to extend his stay with the @entity13 champions			1
the 36 - year - old 's initial spell is due to expire at the end of this month but @entity0 has made clear his desire to keep the player			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 has hinted @entity2 is still likely to be in his squad next month @entity2 ( right ) in training with @entity19 ( left ) and he could extend his stay in the @entity21 ' one of the reasons we asked him to play here was because we knew @entity19 would be leaving us to go to the @entity26 , ' @entity1 manager @entity0 admits @entity2 has also indicated a willingness to stay and @entity0 said earlier this week that he expected a decision within the ' next days '			1
now the @entity30 has revealed that having @entity2 as potential cover for @entity19 during the @entity26 , which starts on january 17 , was always part of the plan			1
' one of the reasons we asked him to play here was because we knew @entity19 would be leaving us to go to the @entity26 , ' @entity0 said			1
it remains to be seen , however , whether @entity0 will get his wish for @entity2 to stay until the end of the season			1
the former @entity43 midfielder is a key part of @entity1 's bold strategy in @entity8 and @entity0 's @entity47 counterparts want him available for the start of the @entity50 season in march			1
negotiations are therefore not straightforward and appear to be taking time , but @entity0 claims any perceived delay is not an issue			1
he said : ' the reason ( it is taking so long ) is not important - the important thing is that he stays here			0
yes i 'm confident he 'll stay but i ca n't say 100 per cent because it does n't depend just on me			0
' it 's not so easy because @entity2 is a @entity8 player			1
he 's only on loan until december so we must respect the other people			2
' @entity2 is on loan from @entity8 but @entity1 want him to stay beyond january @entity19 is likely to join up with his @entity65 team - mates for the @entity26 after the @entity67 third - round tie against @entity68 on january 4			1
@entity65 play their first match at the tournament in @entity72 , which ends with the final on february 8 , on january 20			2
@entity19 was missed during the tournaments of 2012 and 2013 and that is likely to be the case again as he starts to find form after a difficult start to the season			1
but @entity0 has no complaints about the situation having long known it was a possibility			1
he said : ' we are not exactly sure of the dates			0
i think he will play in the @entity67 and then go in the second week of january			0
' i think with every club , you know at the start of the season what will happen			0
you can prepare the season knowing those things and you can do it in the way you think is best			0
' am i happy ? no. you always want to retain the best players here but you know he must go			0
the rules are the rules			0
' @entity19 ( right ) is likely to join up with his @entity65 team - mates after the @entity67 third - round tie on january 4 another player likely to be missing for most of january is top scorer @entity100 , who suffered a knee injury in the defeat of @entity103 on december 6			2
@entity0 hopes the @entity105 striker will be back for the crucial clash with title rivals @entity43 at @entity107 on january 31			2
he said : ' he 'll be back as soon as we hoped			0
i hope by the end of january he 'll be fit			0
' @entity43 lead the @entity21 by three points from @entity1 ahead of the @entity113 fixtures			2
with the @entity114 also still in contention in the @entity116 and @entity117 - and with their @entity67 challenge to begin in january - midfielder @entity119 has spoken of the possibility of winning a quadruple			0
@entity1 were in a similar position at the same stage last year but eventually had to settle for two trophies			2
@entity0 said : ' we tried last year and we could n't do it , for different reasons			1
particularly in the @entity67 we made mistakes , losing at home against @entity130			0
' it 's always possible - difficult , but possible			0
' as for whether @entity43 might achieve such an unprecedented feat , @entity0 is not interested			2
' i do n't analyse @entity43 , ' he said			0
' i will start thinking about them the last week before we play them on january 31			0

@entity0 admits keeping @entity2 as cover was the plan
' one of the reasons we asked him to play here was because we knew @entity19 would be leaving us to go to the @entity26 , ' @entity0 said
@entity2 's future remains *unsure* but @entity1 want to keep him
