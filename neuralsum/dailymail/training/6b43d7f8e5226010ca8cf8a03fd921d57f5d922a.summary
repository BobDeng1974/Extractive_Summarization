' @entity2 came under fire for questioning @entity5 's refusal to play on the april 15 anniversary of the 1989 stadium disaster in which 96 football fans died			1
the 46 - year - old comedian apologised for the ' insensitivity ' of the comments , but insisted today the reaction he received from @entity5 fans went too far			1
writing in the @entity22 newspaper , @entity2 said he has been deemed worse than a serial rapist or paedophile by his critics , while others have sent him ' menacing warnings and threats to maim '			1
he said : ' to comprehend the viciousness of the response , i 've tried to understand the desire to mourn for so long , and so publicly , the death of those fans			0
' the justice for the 96 campaign is ongoing , but the reality of bereavement is not reflected in the staging of memorial services each year			2
' the reality of bereavement is that the loss of a loved one is with you all year round			0
' critics had accused @entity2 of deliberately making the inflammatory comments to create ' free publicity ' as he prepares to go on tour for the first time in 12 years			1
@entity2 said sorry for the remarks , but last week aggravated the situation by joking on @entity52 about disguising himself in a stereotypically ' @entity54 ' costume inspired by @entity55			1
after receiving a barrage of abuse and death threats on @entity52 for the comments he made about @entity10 on tuesday , he wrote yesterday : ‘ going out later			2
i ’ve decided to get a disguise			0
’ he then posted a link to a fancy dress costume of a ‘ comedy scouser ’ including a 1980s shell suit , permed wig and bushy moustache			0
@entity67 and @entity68 , an @entity69 supporter from @entity70 , went on to describe the abusive messages he has received as ' alarming '			0

' @entity101 warnings and threats to maim			0
i am worse than a serial rapist , than a paedophile			0

she said : ' when certain people made certain comments about @entity5 should be playing on the 15th of april , i am afraid that person wants to learn to keep his comments to himself and his opinions to himself			2
' because when comments like that offend and hurt so many thousands of people it 's quite obvious he has got nothing else to worry about in his life as what we have had for 23 years			1
' her criticism was greeted with loud cheers and applause			0
following the furore that greeted the remarks on his weekly football podcast , @entity2 made a £ 1,000 donation to the campaign group - which it refused - and apologised for the tone .			1
