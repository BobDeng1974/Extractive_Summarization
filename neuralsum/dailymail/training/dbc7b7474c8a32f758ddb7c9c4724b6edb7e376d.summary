by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:29 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 09:50 est , 4 january 2014 the heavy rain and gale - force winds battering @entity4 have already started to affect the weekend 's sports schedule , with three @entity7 ties and a race meeting postponed			1
the third round match at @entity11 side @entity10 and @entity13 @entity12 was called off on friday morning due to a waterlogged pitch			1
the fixture will now be played this wednesday at 7.45pm			2
scroll down for a full list of the postponements going without : @entity10 boss @entity18 will have to wait for the visit of @entity12 to @entity20 no action : @entity20 will now host the third round match on wednesday night ( stock image ) the one outstanding second round replay , between @entity26 @entity25 and @entity13 @entity27 , was also postponed because of a saturated pitch			1
the original replay was abandoned during the second half because of heavy rain , so the teams will do battle for a third time on wednesday night			2
it means the third round tie at @entity37 that awaited the winners on tuesday will have to be pushed back			1
the @entity40 v @entity42 tie was called off two hours before kick - off for the same reason			2
hard work : @entity25 's groundsman @entity46 tries to get the @entity7 tie with @entity27 on - but in vain meanwhile , @entity50 's @entity13 clash with @entity51 at @entity52 was also postponed due to a waterlogged pitch			1
the decision was made after a friday afternoon pitch inspection by local referee @entity56			1
he told @entity50 's official website : ' the pitch was very wet , with standing water in various areas			2
' it 's barely playable at the moment , but we 've also had to take into account the weather forecast , which is pretty dire for the next 24 hours			0
' the pitch would therefore be unplayable and it would be dangerous for the players , which is our ultimate concern			0
' storm lashed : waves crash around the sea front in @entity50 on friday , the conditions making the postponement of the match inevitable also in the fourth tier , the game at @entity78 between @entity79 and @entity80 was postponed following an early pitch inspection on saturday morning			1
@entity85 's @entity84 match with @entity86 has been postponed due to a waterlogged pitch at @entity88			2
the club made the announcement after 180mm of rain was recorded at the ground over the last 19 days			0
following a pitch inspection on saturday morning by match official @entity95 , it was decided the pitch was unplayable			1
and the score is ... someone with a good sense of humour at @entity40 after their @entity7 tie with @entity101 at the @entity102 mudbath : the scene at the @entity102 during the saturday afternoon pitch inspection no play today : the @entity42 squad take a walk on the sodden pitch ' @entity85 would like to apologise for any inconvenience this postponement may cause , ' the club said on its official website			1
' no date has , as yet , been confirmed for the rearranged fixture			0
' a number of non-league fixtures have also been postponed already , including the @entity118 fixtures at @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121			0
the @entity123 meeting at @entity124 has been abandoned due to a waterlogged track			1
like much of the country the @entity128 track has been by heavy rain during the week , but clerk of the course @entity132 remained hopeful the fixture could beat the weather as he called an inspection for 7am			2
however , even more rain than was forecast fell overnight and @entity132 called off proceedings before the scheduled inspection time			0
he said : ' we have already abandoned , i 'm afraid			0
' it 's disappointing as the boys worked so hard on friday and the track was raceable at 5pm			0
we thought at that stage the track could take a bit more rain , but we 've had far more than forecast			0
' we thought we might get six or seven millimetres , and we would probably have coped with that , but it started raining at 1.30am and it was torrential until 6am			0
' we 've had 14 millimetres of rain already and it 's still raining , so unfortunately we 've been beaten by the weather			0
' with the @entity154 issuing a number of weather warnings across the country , further postponements are likely and a number of football clubs will hold pitch inspections on saturday morning			0
