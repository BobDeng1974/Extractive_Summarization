by @entity0 professor @entity1 said : ' patients could have better recovery and survival if more specialised centres like ours existed for treating them ' a quarter of patients who develop a digestive complication after surgery needlessly suffer ‘ a harrowing death ’ due to an @entity13 postcode lottery , a leading surgeon has claimed			1
approximately 600 people suffer acute intestinal failure in @entity13 hospitals every year , leading to 150 deaths , according to @entity13 surveys			0
the condition usually occurs as a result of an operation on the abdomen , such as removal of a cancer or even after appendicitis , leading to parts of the gut unexpectedly failing			1
this triggers a cascade of complications , resulting in the need for intensive care			2
later , patients may be discharged home but require drip - feeding and full - time personal care			1
yet everyone who had surgery for the condition at the @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity43 , has survived in the past three years , indicating that deaths are avoidable			1
‘ whether or not you die of this complication is a postcode lottery , ’ says professor @entity1 , consultant surgeon at @entity45			1
‘ often patients will succumb quite quickly , but others have months of harrowing illness , and one patient was in hospital for two years			2
it ’s a horrible situation			0
‘ patients could have better recovery and survival if more specialised centres like ours existed for treating them			1
at the moment there is a one in four chance of a slow , painful and undignified death if you develop this problem			0
our success rates show this need not be the case			0
’ the @entity42 team claim their success rate is due to a large , dedicated staff , with one consultant surgeon and two nurses to every five patients			1
rates of intestinal failure are rising steadily , due to the ageing population having more complex surgical procedures			0
more patients survive life - threatening illnesses but are then left debilitated			2
while exact figures do not exist , acute intestinal failure is estimated to affect about ten people per million			0
some 600 people are in hospital with the condition at any one time			2
the @entity42 team ( @entity45 pictured ) claim their success rate is due to a large , dedicated staff , with one consultant surgeon and two nurses to every five patients the @entity41 treats around 220 patients at home , fed via drips , and between 20 and 25 in hospital at any one time , or about 75 a year			1
the staff also includes dieticians , physiotherapists , pharmacists and psychologists			0
its treatment advances have attracted international recognition and were presented at the annual president ’s @entity100 at the @entity102			0
there is one other intestinal failure centre in the @entity105 , at @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity108			0
treating people in such centres could also reduce costs as most patients have been in hospital for many months			1
‘ although patients are often in hospital with us , that represents the end of the treatment process , and they ’d otherwise be in hospital longer somewhere else and they require a significant cost and huge effort to treat , ’ says prof @entity1			1
the other intestinal failure centre is at @entity106 in @entity107 ‘ one patient had been in hospital for two years and the average is usually some months – plus it ’s not unusual for them to have had a large number of operations before they come to us which have failed to address the problem			0
approximately 600 people a year suffer from acute intestinal failure in @entity13 hospitals a 2008 review of treating intestinal failure recommended a network of intestinal failure centres be set up			2
but that has not happened			0
prof @entity1 adds : ‘ if you live near an intestinal failure unit you are more likely to get referred to one			1
’ one reason for the @entity42 ’s centre ’s low death rate is the low level of infection			1
‘ the ability to look after a central feeding line put into a patient ’s heart over a prolonged period without it getting infected is crucial – nationally ten per cent used will lead to an infection , but in our unit there has not been a single infection in 15 years in any of our patients			2
‘ the condition is very serious but the size of team needed to get the patient through that is just not available everywhere			2
‘ it ’s not that different to doing transplant surgery : you would n’t go to your local hospital for a heart transplant , you ’d go to a specialist centre			0
’ he says : ‘ the ideal would be patients able to access that level of support and expertise within 100 miles of their own home rather than travelling from all over the @entity105 to our centre			2
’ one patient saved by the @entity42 unit is retired salesman @entity185 , 65			1
a routine removal of a cancerous polyp in 2006 left him in hospital for nine months with intestinal failure			0
he developed pelvic abscesses and peritonitis , then an open wound in his stomach			0
the married father - of - two from @entity195 was eventually transferred to the @entity42 centre and saved by a complex , 16 - hour operation that removed the damaged bowel and filled in the stomach holes by taking tissue from his legs			1
a spokesman for @entity205 said : ‘ commissioners are currently working with clinical experts to ensure that services across the country reflect the national standard and deliver the best possible services for all patients with these conditions			0
