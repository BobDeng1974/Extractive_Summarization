he will say : ‘ i have a very clear message for @entity2 , @entity29 , @entity30 and the rest			1
you have a duty to act on this and it is a moral duty			0
‘ if the progress is slow or non-existent , i can tell you we are already looking at the legislative options we have to force action			1
’ mr @entity5 's initiative follows a meeting at @entity42 last week with the parents of @entity44 and @entity45			1
warnings : from this month , anyone logging on to a child abuse site will receive a message that the images have been taken down the parents of murdered schoolgirls @entity44 and @entity45 met with @entity5 to plead for him to tighten controls on child abuse images online			1
@entity45 , was found guilty of abducting and murdering five - year - old @entity45 in @entity55 last october			1
@entity56 will spend his whole life in prison after he was found guilty of killing april in a sexually motivated attack			0
sitting next to her mother @entity61 , april 's father @entity60 said : ' everyone knows the @entity65 and april stories			0
what we are trying to do is stop it being another child			2
we never want another family sitting here having suffered the same thing , ' reported @entity72 @entity44 , admitted murdering 12 - year - old @entity44 in august 2012			2
@entity73 , 37 , who was jailed for a minimum of 38 years in may , had sexually assaulted and murdered @entity65 when she stayed the night at the house			0
her mother @entity76 , who attended with her partner , told mr @entity5 during the 30 - minute meeting at no. 10 : ' it ’s a triangle — the people uploading , the people letting them upload and the people looking for it			1
we need to knock the first , second and third parts of this triangle down like bowling pins			0
' the @entity87 told the couples he had changed the locks on his @entity90 after he walked in on his daughter watching a video of how to make a bath bomb			2
' i came down and she was watching a @entity97 video which luckily was someone making a bath bomb			0
it could have been something completely different			0
'' the prime minister told @entity15 's @entity14 he was prepared to bring in new laws if necessary			2
he said : ' i 'm concerned as a politician and as a parent about this issue , and i think all of us have been a bit guilty of saying : well it 's the internet , it 's lawless , there 's nothing you can do about it			2
' and that 's wrong			0
i mean just because it 's the internet does n't mean there should n't be laws and rules , and also responsible behaviour			1
' he welcomed the steps already being taken by internet firms , but added : ' there is this problem ... that some people are putting simply appalling terms into the internet in order to find illegal images of child abuse			1
' and , remember , every one of these pictures is a crime scene and they 're getting results			2
i think it 's wrong that they should get results and we need to have very , very strong conversations with those companies about saying no , you should n't provide results for some terms that are so depraved and disgusting , i ca n't even say them on your show			2
' and that , i think , there 's going to be a big argument there , and if we do n't get what we need we 'll have to look at legislation			0
' he added : ' look , i believe in free speech , but free speech does n't mean you have the right to incite murder , it does n't mean you have the right to incite child abuse			2
' so it 's about companies wanting to act responsibly			0
if you think about it , there 's really a triangle here			0
there are the people uploading the images			2
we 've got to go after them			0
there are the people looking at the images			2
we 've got to go after them			0
but there is also in this triangle the companies that are enabling it to happen , and they do need to do more to help us with this			0
' the warning follows an anti-internet porn summit in @entity181 last month which agreed to give the @entity182 new powers to seek out and block offensive material			0
in his speech , mr @entity5 will hail the fact that from this month , anyone trying to log on to a child abuse site will receive a warning that the site contained illegal images and has been taken down he will say : ‘ this is a vital step forward but we need to go further			1
these warning pages should also tell those who ’ve landed on it that they face consequences , such as losing their job , their family , even access to their children if they continue			1
’ zero tolerance : @entity5 says that search engine firms should introduce a blacklist of disgusting searches which should produce no results mr @entity5 also says that search engine firms should introduce a ‘ blacklist ’ of disgusting searches which should produce no result			1
he will add : ‘ there are some searches which are so abhorrent – and where there can be no doubt whatsoever about the sick and malevolent intent of the searcher – that there should be no search results at all			1
’ the prime minister warns the internet giants not to use technical problems as an excuse for inaction			1
he will say : ‘ set your greatest brains to work on this			0
you are not separate from our society , you are part of our society and you must play a responsible role in it			1
‘ this is quite simply about obliterating this disgusting material from the net – and we will do whatever it takes			0
’ last night , a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ we have a zero - tolerance attitude to child sexual abuse imagery			1
whenever we discover it , we respond quickly to remove and report it			0
‘ we recently donated $ 5 million to help combat this problem and are committed to continuing the dialogue with the government on these issues			0

@entity5 is demanding most ' abhorrent ' searches should produce no results
he tells internet firms you ' must play a responsible role ' in our society
new on - screen warnings so that anyone searching for child porn images is immediately told their behaviour could cost them their job or even access to their children .
a complete *ban* on the most ‘ abhorrent ’ searches so that the search engines produce no result for those *phrases* .
