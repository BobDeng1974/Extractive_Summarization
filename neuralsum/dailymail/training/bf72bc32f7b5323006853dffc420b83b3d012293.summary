by @entity0 published : 06:34 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 06:58 est , 2 october 2013 with their metal roofs , six - foot high numbers and uncompromising industrial design , they look like shipping containers full of goods ready to be exported to @entity7			1
in fact , these awkward - looking boxes are new beach huts for the coastal town of @entity12 in @entity13 , where councillors hope to sell leases on them at £ 20,000 apiece			1
residents have branded the new huts ' monstrosities ' and say they look nothing like the pretty , traditional huts just a few yards down the town 's @entity22			1
waiting to be loaded onto a boat ? in fact , these are beach huts for the 21st century in @entity12 , @entity13 ' like shipping containers ' : residents in the @entity13 coastal town signed a petition against the new huts they also say the ' flimsy ' design of the eight new huts will not withstand the brutal east coast winter			0
@entity36 funded the £ 120,000 cost of building the huts - there are eight more in the pipeline - and now plans to sell seven - year leases on each one for £ 20,000			1
the roofs are covered with small sedum plants , the walls are made of clear plastic filled with hardcore , and the fronts painted in bright colours			2
but locals in the town are not impressed by the design of the huts , which are said to be made of vandal - proof materials that will not catch fire			0
@entity55 , a councillor in @entity12 , said : ' they really do look terrible - they are monstrosities			0
' i would pay £ 20,000 to have them pulled down - they are more like shipping containers than beach huts			2
' modern design : the walls of the new huts are made of clear plastic filled with hardcore to deter vandals holiday spot : @entity36 , which approved the huts and spent £ 120,000 on them , hopes to let them dream destination : the new @entity22 huts have roofs covered with small sedum plants she added : ' they are very dark inside and i think they will be vandalised too			1
i do n’t think they are strong enough structures to last			0
' @entity81 , who lives nearby said : ' what is there to stop the sea winds blowing these flimsy articles into kingdom come ? absolutely nothing			0
' they sit there with no foundations like garden sheds , just waiting to be destroyed in the first gale of the winter			0
' has anyone actually been to @entity22 in the winter to see how rough things can get ? if any of these huts are still in place this time next year , i will donate £ 50 to charity			2
' traditional @entity102 beach huts : these old - fashioned wooden huts further down the beach are much loved and the not so traditional : the new beach huts have been criticised by locals for their design and appearance another eight of the huts , which were designed by a @entity112 architecture practice , are set to be built further along @entity22 , despite more than 200 local residents signing a petition against them			1
@entity115 of @entity36 defended the new addition to the @entity102 shoreline , saying they would ' blend in with our existing range '			2
and the council 's @entity121 said : ' the unique and generous size of the huts has received a great deal of praise and overwhelmingly positive feedback			0

huts in @entity102 have metal roofs and plastic walls filled with hardcore
@entity36 paid £ 120,000 for them and hope to let them for £ 20,000
eight have gone up on the town 's @entity22 and another eight are coming
but residents say they *'re* monstrosities and hope they *'ll* blow away in gales
