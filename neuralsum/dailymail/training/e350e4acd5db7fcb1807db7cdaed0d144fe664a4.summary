by @entity0 a new six - minute test could diagnose parkinson 's disease in its early stages			1
@entity4 ( pictured ) was diagnosed with the disease in 1991 scientists have developed a six - minute test which could give an early diagnosis of @entity2			1
currently @entity2 ’s patients only discover they have the debilitating neurological problem when the symptoms have already taken hold			2
but @entity14 academics have come up with a new way of spotting the disease at an early stage			1
the researchers were able to detect early parkinson ’s disease with a remarkable 85 per cent accuracy			1
the technique uses an mri scanner to monitor the neural connections in a concentrated area at the very centre of the brain			1
even at a very early stage , @entity2 ’s patients had much weaker connections in the basal ganglia region of the brain , which is associated with motor control			1
the study , which has been published in the journal @entity34 , found that by taking 180 pictures in six minutes they could spot the poor connections			0
they also found that the test had a very low chance of incorrectly diagnosing healthy people with the disease			2
the said scans could be done on people in their fifties , the age when the condition usually begins to take hold			0
study leader dr @entity48 , a psychiatrist at @entity14 , said : ‘ at the moment we have no way to predict who is at risk of @entity2 in the vast majority of cases			0
currently it is only possible to diagnose parkinson 's disease when it is more advanced			1
@entity58 ( pictured ) was diagnosed with the disease in september last year on the same day as he was told he had cancer ‘ we are excited that this @entity62 technique might prove to be a good marker for the earliest signs of @entity2 ’s			2
the results are very promising			0
’ around 127,000 people in the @entity67 are believed to have @entity2 ’s , which causes tremors , slow movements and muscle rigidity			0
the new test uses an mri scanner to monitor the neural connections at the very centre of the brain			1
sir @entity77 ( pictured ) has recently revealed that he has @entity2 's there is currently no cure and no way of halting the disease			1
but the progressive nerve cell damage produced by @entity2 ’s is thought to begin long before any symptoms appear			0
dr @entity84 said : ‘ we are still at least ten years away from that magic breakthrough which allows us to slow down the progression of @entity2 ’s			0
' but in order to get there , we need a way of spotting the disease early on			0
the two things go hand in hand			0
’ and co-author dr @entity94 , from @entity14 ’s @entity96 department of clinical neurosciences , said : ‘ because it is so sensitive , we hope that it will be able to predict who is at risk of disease before any symptoms have developed			0
’ @entity104 , a spokesman for @entity105 , which funded the research , added : ‘ this new research takes us one step closer to diagnosing @entity2 ’s at a much earlier stage – one of the biggest challenges facing research into the condition			2
‘ one person every hour is diagnosed with @entity2 ’s in the @entity67 , and we hope that the researchers are able to continue to refine their test so that it can one day be part of clinical practice			2

currently , @entity2 's can only be diagnosed once it is well - established
the new test involves using an mri scanner to look at neural connections
even at an early stage , @entity2 's patients have weaker connections
the test can detect early - stage parkinson 's disease with 85 *%* accuracy
