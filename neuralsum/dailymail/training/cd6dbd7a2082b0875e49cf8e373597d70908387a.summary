@entity0 has revealed plans to begin selling the first air powered car next year			1
based on a @entity0 208 , it will combine a normal engine with a radical new system that runs on compressed air			1
the firm says the car could reduce petrol bills by 80 % when driven in cities			1
saving the planet : the @entity14 technology could allow a car the size of a @entity17 or @entity0 to emit as little as 69g/km of co2 the system combines a gasoline engine with an air engine which is used at speeds under 70mph the system works by using a normal internal combustion engine , special hydraulics and an adapted gearbox along with compressed air cylinders that store and release energy			1
this enables it to run on petrol or air , or a combination of the two			1
air power would be used solely for city use , automatically activated below 43mph and available for ‘ 60 to 80 per cent of the time in city driving ’			0

by 2020 , the cars could be achieving an average of 117 miles a gallon , the company predicts			1
the air compression system can re-use all the energy normally lost when slowing down and braking			1
the motor and a pump are in the engine bay , fed by a compressed air tank underneath the car , running parallel to the exhaust			1
the revolutionary new ‘ @entity14 ’ engine system – the first to combine petrol with compressed air – is a breakthrough for hybrid cars because expensive batteries will no longer be needed			1
lift - off : the air power will be automatically activated below 43mph and can be used for up to 80 per cent of driving time in urban areas spacious interior : allows for full - sized passenger compartment without surrendering boot volume			0
driving comfort and road handling : @entity14 promises to deliver nimble response with the boost effect as well as first - class road handling thanks to its automatic transmission			1
worldwide potential : the technology is viable in all markets , making it possible for energy efficient cards in all types of climate and regardless of the state of the roads			0
boot : no space for a spare tyre once the @entity14 motor is installed			2
cars fitted with @entity14 will be about £ 1,000 cheaper to buy than current hybrid models			2
for more than two years , 100 elite scientists and engineers have been working on the air - powered car in top - secret conditions at @entity0 ’s research and development centre at @entity104 , just south of @entity105			2
@entity14 is the centrepiece of @entity0 chief executive @entity108 ’s efforts to restore the fortunes of the historic car maker			1
the revolutionary system will be able to be installed on any normal family car without altering its external shape or size or reducing the boot size , provided the spare wheel is not stored there			2
from the outside , an air - powered car will look identical to a conventional vehicle			2
a spokesman said : ‘ we are not talking about weird and wacky machines			0
these are going to be in everyday cars			0
’ @entity0 , which unveiled its prototype yesterday , envisages introducing it in smaller models such as the 208 at first			0
running on air : the @entity0 is one model that may use the air engine technology in future the company said that as well as being greener and cheaper to run , the air system created no extra dangers in a collision			1
motorists never run the risk of running out of compressed air late at night on a deserted country road because the car will be fitted with a sophisticated artificial brain that ensures it replenishes itself automatically			2
the air compresses and decompresses of its own accord as the car speeds up and slows down			2
the @entity0 company was founded in 1810 and the family still has a controlling stake			0
@entity151 drafted in @entity152 - widely hailed in the @entity153 for rescuing @entity154 , the former @entity155 , from the brink of ruin - in 2009			0
@entity108 ’s attempts to revive the marque have been hit by the euro meltdown and militant @entity161 unions			0
a compressed air cylinder next to the exhaust of the new car worldwide sales for 2012 were down 8.8per cent to 2.82m			0
the company has been hindered in efforts to improve its performance by @entity161 ’s rigid labour laws			0
it has also been plagued by violent industrial action at its @entity172 plant near @entity105 which is due to close next year with the loss of thousands of jobs			0
it is embroiled in controversy with rival @entity177 car makers over a @entity161 state guarantee given to its financing arm last year .			0

@entity181 *invents* technology for air car ready for the market by 2016
' @entity14 ' engine system runs on petrol and air , instead of *electricity*
company predicts ' @entity14 ' to achieve 117 miles per gallon by 2020
