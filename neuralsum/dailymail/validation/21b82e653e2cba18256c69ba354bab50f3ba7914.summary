@entity0 is being linked with a move away from @entity3 winners @entity2 as the former @entity4 forward continues to face criticism from the club 's supporters			1
@entity8 and @entity9 have both been credited with having an interest in bringing the world 's most expensive player back to the @entity13			1
@entity14 asked @entity8 fan @entity15 of 90min.com to give his thoughts about a possible switch to @entity18			1
@entity0 reacts with disappointment as @entity21 players celebrate after the @entity22 on march 22 @entity0 scored twice to help @entity23 beat @entity24 3 - 0 in a @entity26 qualifier on saturday given the opportunity , there 's not a club in the world who would n't want to sign @entity0 and @entity8 are no different			1
the @entity32 is the future of football			0
@entity8 are showing signs of life again			1
we 've picked up our form under @entity39 , sit in the @entity13 's top four and beat @entity41 at @entity42 prior to the international break			1
big money was spent last summer and it will be this year too			0
it 's all systems go in terms of firing us back to the top of @entity50 and @entity52 football			0
however , while the attack is starting to click into gear , something is still missing			0
most of us have confidence that @entity61 will come good , but we still want more			0
@entity0 is what we want			1
having two former @entity2 stars in tandem at @entity18 is the stuff of dreams			1
sure , we 'd love to have @entity67 back too , but our former @entity68 has just turned 30 and dare we say it - his best days may be behind him			2
a 25 - year - old @entity0 is the man to pin the hopes on			2
@entity0 's celebration was cut short as he had a goal disallowed for offside against @entity21 @entity0 argues with @entity21 forward @entity74 as @entity2 lost 2 - 1 to the @entity76 leaders it 's not all plain sailing for the boy from @entity80 in @entity81			1
he has been criticised in the @entity2 press for not pulling his weight , he went missing in last weekend 's @entity22 and his car even got a boot up the backside from a supporter in the fallout			1
@entity2 fans are historically fickle and @entity0 is their latest scapegoat			1
rest assured that it 'll be his head on the chopping block next time @entity2 lose a game			2
he does n't deserve to be treated like some children 's toy - picked up when loved and thrown down to the ground when not			0
@entity0 should seek a club where his talents are appreciated			2
@entity8 are prepared to offer an escape route and the subsequent affection he needs			2
unfortunately , @entity0 is still a big part of @entity103 's plans and the player himself feels like he still has so much to prove			2
@entity8 are not an option that @entity0 wants to take just now , but the offer will always remain on the table			1
@entity0 has been criticised by fans this season and even had his car attacked by angry supporters the former @entity4 forward leads the celebrations after scoring his second and @entity23 ' third of the match his potential signing is not a case of need			1
after all , no club is going to spend Â£ 86m on a player if he is n't considered some kind of luxury			0
@entity0 is a player that can lead us to our former glory			2
you 'd only have to look at the effect he had on @entity4 before leaving for @entity81 for proof of his influence			0
however much he 'd cost , @entity0 would be a worthwhile investment			0
his ability to play on either flank or through the middle make him a great option , given he can fit around the likes of @entity61 , @entity136 and @entity137 in whatever system suits			0
@entity139 , he could even play alongside @entity140			0
any move might unfairly consign the excellent @entity142 back to bench - warmer , but football has a habit of not being fair			0
nevertheless , do n't expect the move to happen this summer			0
@entity0 has a lot left to prove in @entity81 and he 's too proud a person to walk away from his dream club just yet			0
but if there 's ever a return to the @entity13 on the cards for @entity0 , we will be waiting with open arms			1
