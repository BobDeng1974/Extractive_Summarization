sir @entity0 has given his first verdict on @entity3 ’s reign at @entity4 , suggesting the new @entity6 manager has been ‘ brilliant ’			1
@entity0 has been an interested onlooker as @entity7 has gone about the task of rebuilding the squad he inherited from @entity11 in the summer			1
the @entity13 veteran has spent big as he looks to undo the damage of the 2013 - 14 season and the @entity4 first team now looks vastly different to the one @entity0 led to the @entity18 title just 16 months ago			1
@entity0 's final match - @entity31 5 - 5 @entity4 ( may 19 , 2013 ) @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 ( @entity36 83 ) , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 ( @entity42 60 ) , @entity43 ( @entity44 69 ) , @entity45 , @entity46 @entity7 's last match - @entity4 2 - 1 @entity30 ( october 5 , 2014 ) @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 ( @entity53 71 ) , @entity34 ( @entity54 79 ) , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity46 , @entity58 ( @entity59 73 ) but @entity0 has endorsed @entity7 ’s approach and said : ‘ @entity3 has made a lot of changes and , thinking about that , actually , maybe he ’s doing the right thing — to clear the decks and build his own team			1
' because he ’s got the experience and coaching ability to do that			0
the way he ’s approached it , i think he has been brilliant			0
’ @entity7 is still integrating players like @entity73 , @entity58 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity51 and @entity52 into this team as @entity4 slowly creep back up the @entity18 table after an uncertain start to the season			1
it is understood , though , that @entity4 still plan to recruit four more new players in the next two transfer windows			2
@entity7 , for example , still wants a top - class central defender , a holding midfield player and a right back			2
the @entity13 's side have been slowly creeping back up the @entity18 table after a tough start @entity0 has attended a good number of @entity4 matches but has deliberately kept his distance from @entity7 as the former @entity93 and @entity94 manager has settled in			1
the former @entity4 boss has never once regretted his decision to retire in may 2013			0
but speaking in an @entity98 interview — called ‘ sir @entity99 ’ , which will be aired on the club 's station on monday — @entity0 light - heartedly recalled his first few months as a former manager			1
he said : ‘ it was the first time i ’ve ever had a holiday in my life in december and i ’m sitting there at poolside in @entity110 and i said to @entity111 , “ i should be at @entity112 ”			0
’ @entity0 and @entity7 last faced each other with @entity4 and @entity94 in the 2010 @entity114 @entity0 refused to comment on extracts from former @entity4 captain @entity19 's book meanwhile , @entity0 will resist the temptation to hit back at @entity19 in print over the infamous bust - up that led to the @entity120 leaving @entity4 under a cloud in november 2005			1
@entity19 has re-opened their war of words in his explosive new autobiography @entity126 in which he refers to @entity0 as a ‘ f * * * * * * p * * * * ’ over the incident			2
coincidentally , the second instalment of @entity0 ’s autobiography , is being updated and released in paperback on october 23			0
however , sources at publishers @entity133 say that @entity0 will not be adding to his existing account of the rift with @entity19			2
instead , he will focus on the year that followed his retirement and @entity140 ’ ill - fated spell			0
additional reporting by @entity143 like our @entity4 facebook page			0
@entity146 unsurprised by @entity7 revival			0

sir @entity0 has finally given his verdict on @entity3
@entity0 described the @entity4 manager as ' brilliant '
the @entity153 approvingly says that @entity7 is ' doing the right thing '
@entity0 refused to be *drawn* in on @entity19 's book *revelations*
@entity7 still in the hunt for a midfielder , centre back and right back
