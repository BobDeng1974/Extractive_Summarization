by @entity0 shots echo in the street below as my phone rings			2
it ’s just after dawn in a @entity7 under curfew			2
the head of the @entity10 – the fanatical @entity12 force and avowed enemies of the @entity14 – has agreed to see me : but on his terms			1
i must venture into @entity16 , the slum district of the @entity18 capital that defied @entity20 and @entity21 occupation for a decade			1
now the militants have a new enemy – the @entity25 terror group @entity26 , who have left a trail of blood across @entity18 and are fast closing in on @entity7 itself			1
in the enemy 's lair : @entity0 with @entity33 , both circled with his militia men that has not dimmed the army ’s hatred of the @entity14 – and i will be told in no uncertain terms that foreign intervention will be ‘ unacceptable ’			1
but first i must get to @entity16 , a volatile place with a ‘ fight - to - the - death ’ spirit , whose streets have seen terrible sectarian bloodshed			1
it was named after the father of @entity49 , the army ’s founder			2
he was a grand ayatollah who stood up to @entity51 and was shot dead by the dictator ’s @entity25 supporters			1
i had encountered the @entity10 before			2
in 2005 , when i was with a @entity56 patrol in @entity57 , we were attacked by their fighters aiming rocket - propelled grenades at us			1
yet now i am speaking to them ; agreeing to the instructions for this meeting : i am to drive to the @entity64 , call a number , and wait for @entity67 ’s men			2
the militant leader knows no compromise , and only last week warned @entity21 and her allies to ‘ take their hands off @entity18 ’			1
he claims to have re-invented his fighting force as a ‘ peace brigade ’ to defend @entity7			1
driving through empty early - morning streets , the dashboard shows a temperature of @entity79 ( @entity80 ) , another day of suffocating heat			1
inside our car , flak jackets are flattened against the doors , protection against roadside bombs that kill four people a day here			2
@entity18 prime minister @entity90 , who @entity33 says they reject as the leader of @entity18 this is a city in a state of siege , nervously awaiting , fearing , an attack by the @entity25 forces or a return of the @entity21			1
checkpoints , car searches and blast walls are all a way of life			2
we arrive at the hospital , a sad run - down structure surrounded by rolls of barbed wire			1
seven @entity10 men soon pull up , all in black police uniforms and bristling with weapons			0
they check our papers and signal for us to follow them through the rubbish - strewn streets			1
low - key is not their style			1
their @entity118 pick - up careers through busy markets with much hooting of horns and screeching of brakes			1
any vehicles getting in the way end up at the dangerous end of a rifle barrel			0
residents live their lives , opening pavement kiosks , servicing rundown cars and recycling tyres			0
two sheep are led into a butcher ’s shop to meet their fate			0
cans of petrol are lined up at the roadside , a symbol of poverty in an oil - rich country			2
but no one looks up as we speed past			0
people here are trained to see only what they need to see			0
eventually we skid around a corner between broken buildings			0
white gates swing open on to a courtyard			0
a striking figure in a turban comes out to greet us – the man we have come to meet , cleric - cum - warlord @entity156 , @entity67 ’s commander in @entity7			1
our escort excitedly surround him , scrambling for photos			0
once in his reception room , with its garish red velvet furniture and an excerpt from the @entity163 engraved on a goat - skin , it is clear @entity165 is playing games with us			2
all of his pronouncements carry an underlying menace			0
fingering prayer beads , he says : ‘ we have changed			0
we are warriors for peace now , we do n’t want war			1
we want the people of @entity18 to unite against our new enemy [ @entity26 ]			1
in the past our enemies were @entity21 and @entity20 , invading our country			0
our duty then was to get them out			0
’ all the rockets , the heavy artillery , the cans of @entity181 , the ammo vests of the suicide bombers we saw in a big parade of peace brigade force last weekend – they are all for defence , he insists			2
‘ we will use those weapons if @entity26 comes to @entity7			1
and we will not work alongside the @entity18 military			1
we will not take orders from them			0
’ members of the @entity10 , who have a new enemy , the @entity25 terror group @entity26 , who have left a trail of blood across @entity18 he flinches as i take something from my rucksack and i realise : the armed escort , the secrecy , it was all for his security , not ours			1
i smile reassuringly at him			0
we are both aware of the danger we represent to each other			0
@entity165 has a warning : ‘ we reject @entity90 , the prime minister , and @entity209 , speaker of parliament			1
they are thieves and bad leaders			0
we want them to go , we have nothing but contempt for them			0
we also reject outside interference			2
we will not accept @entity21 or @entity20 interfering again			0
we do n’t want @entity218 or @entity219 or any other foreign forces here			0
‘ what would @entity20 do if foreign forces invaded ? that would lead to violence for you , would it not ? ’ the veiled threat hangs in the air			0
this was a man delivering his master ’s message			0
leaving @entity165 ’s lair , we found ourselves on the streets without an escort			0
now we were on our own			0
a phone call brings us a security guard on a motor - scooter who leads us out of the slum			2
@entity16 is behind us now , but what happens here next could seal the future of @entity18 , and beyond .			1

the @entity247 have a new enemy - the @entity25 terror group @entity26
head of the militants @entity156 says they are now warriors of peace
adds they reject @entity90 as the prime minister of @entity18
