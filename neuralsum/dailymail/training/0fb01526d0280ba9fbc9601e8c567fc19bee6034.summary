startling : details of the alleged case were revealed in a letter to education secretary @entity3 a successful @entity6 school could face closure after failing to invite religious leaders from other faiths to speak to pupils , it has been reported			1
the school is under threat of being downgraded by @entity14 inspectors for breaching new rules designed to promote ‘ @entity17 values ’ such as tolerance and individual liberty			1
they were introduced in the wake of the @entity23 scandal , where @entity25 schools were infiltrated by hardline @entity27 groups			0
the @entity28 , which is giving legal support to the small independent school in the @entity31 , has written to education secretary @entity3 disclosing the details of the case , according to a report in the @entity34			1
the group expressed fears that there are ‘ disturbing consequences ’ for religious schools which are falling foul of measures intended to combat extremism			1
inspectors are understood to have warned the head that the school , which was previously rated as ‘ good ’ , that it would be downgraded to ‘ adequate ’ for failing to meet standards requiring it to ‘ actively promote ’ harmony between different faiths because it had failed to bring in representatives from other religions			1
they warned that unless the school could demonstrate how it was going to meet the new requirements , there would be a further full inspection which could , in a worst case scenario , lead to it being closed			1
it was among 40 schools across the country given lightning inspections last month in the aftermath of findings that @entity27 had imposed strict religious practices on @entity25 state schools			0
@entity14 rules state that inspectors must ‘ consider the effectiveness of safeguarding arrangements ’ including ‘ the approach to keeping pupils safe from the dangers of radicalisation and extremism ’			2
the @entity28 – which is planning a legal challenge to the consultation , arguing that it was rushed through – fears the new guidelines could be used to clamp down on the teaching of anything deemed politically incorrect on issues such as marriage			2

‘ astonishingly it was told it should invite representatives of other faith groups to lead assemblies and lessons , such as an imam			0
the wording of the regulations inevitably results in these kind of outcomes			0
‘ while we obviously support attempts to address the problem of radicalisation , the current regulations fail to do this			0
’ a @entity129 spokesman said last night : ‘ the @entity130 are designed to ensure every school prepares children for life in modern @entity17			0
we make no apology for demanding high standards and the promotion of tolerance and respect of all faiths and cultures			0
