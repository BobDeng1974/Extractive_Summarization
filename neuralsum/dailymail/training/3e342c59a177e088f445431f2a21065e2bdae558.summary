the @entity1 prime minister clearly has some first - day - at - work nerves as he managed to mess up his first international press conference this week			1
@entity4 was introducing fellow @entity6 and @entity7 leaders when he forgot their names , and was caught on camera desperately mumbling to an aide for help			2
the @entity13 leader managed to correctly introduce @entity15 pm @entity14 , but when he came to @entity17 's foreign trade minister @entity16 he went silent			1
it all started so well : @entity1 prime minister @entity4 addresses his first international press conference and begins to introduce leaders form the other @entity6 countries and the @entity21 ... ... @entity22 leader @entity4 manages to correctly identify his @entity15 counterpart , @entity14 , and then it all goes wrong giggles on stage : @entity17 's foreign trade minister @entity16 clearly finds the funny side as mr @entity4 , in a heavy @entity1 accent , blames his paperwork although @entity1 are known for their proficiency in the @entity34 language , this was clearly not @entity36 's favourite subject at school			1
realising he does not remember @entity16 ’s name , he starts fumbling with his notes before confessing : ’ i think i 've been given the wrong paperwork			0
’ stuttering in a heavy accent , the newly elected former welder has to ask for help from his press secretary			0
not until he is given a new note he can return to presenting the other politicians , who can be seen giggling on stage			0
@entity4 , 57 , was elected prime minister in september this year , but despite now being the leader of one of @entity53 ’s most successful economies , he has never been a member of parliament , let alone been in government			1
help : after blaming ' the wrong papers ' , @entity4 asks his press secretary @entity56 for help finally : after some theatre - whispering and a new note , @entity36 can introduce the other politicians the former welder , who has been active in the @entity22 since his early teens , worked as a trade union leader before being elected party leader			1
after forming a coalition with the @entity65 and the @entity66 , he won around 40 percent of the vote in elections that took place in mid-september			0
the mistake by the new leader was slammed by social media users across the region after footage of the event was shown on @entity1 news website @entity76 and other news sources			0
the summit had been called to discuss @entity81 's growing military presence in the @entity7 and @entity1 's controversial decision to recognise @entity83 as a state			2
fortunately for @entity36 , after speaking with a press officer he recovered his composure and presented @entity88 and the other international attendees .			0

@entity1 's @entity4 messed up first international press conference
new prime minister forgot name of @entity17 's foreign trade minister
former welder @entity4 was elected prime minister in september
he has never been an mp , but went from union leader to party leader
