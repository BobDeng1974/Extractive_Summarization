so was @entity0 the unluckiest horse at last year ’s @entity2 ? twelve months of wondering should finally be answered at around half past three on tuesday afternoon			1
the ground the gelding surrendered when hampered by the fatal fall of @entity7 at the third flight seemed crucial at the time			2
but were we all conned by the final - furlong surge that he conjured under jockey @entity12 to grab third place behind @entity14 and @entity15 , just in front of dual winner @entity17 in fourth ? @entity12 has unfinished business in monday 's big race at @entity2 @entity12 riding @entity0 on the way to victory in the @entity22 @entity14 and @entity17 , who have traded punches all winter across the @entity25 , are back again			1
they have been joined by @entity17 ’s unbeaten stablemate @entity27 , christened ‘ @entity28 ’ because of the stunning visual nature of his performances			2
significantly , he is also the choice of stable jockey @entity32			2
together they make up one of the strongest ever @entity25 assaults on the @entity36			0
@entity37 can muster only three runners and two of them , @entity39 and @entity40 , are rank outsiders			0
with hopes resting on the shoulders of the 22 - year - old @entity12 and the gelding trained by his father @entity45 — and with the @entity25 wave advancing — @entity12 could be forgiven if he felt like @entity47 in the film @entity48			1
however , he is totally focused on exorcising last year ’s nightmare experience			1
it was one which prompted an enduring image of the @entity53 , the crest - fallen @entity12 with his head in his hands			1
back in 2013 @entity56 outscored @entity37 by winning 14 of the 27 races , the first time in @entity2 history that the @entity59 have won the majority of the races			1
@entity37 was back on top last year ( 15 - 12 ) but face a strong challenge this time , with five of tuesday ’s races containing favourites from across the water			1
@entity56 dominates the betting for the feature @entity36 , with the new one an island of red , white and blue amid the green , white and orange of the main contenders			0
@entity75 is entirely focused on exorcising last year 's nightmare experience if the hot four favourites trained by @entity78 and ridden by @entity32 all win on tuesday , bookmakers claim they could be facing their worst day since @entity81 ’s @entity80 at @entity82 in 1996 , which cost them £ 40million			1
the @entity25 duo struck twice on opening day last year and team up this time with @entity86 in the @entity87 ’ @entity36 , @entity88 in the @entity89 , @entity27 in the @entity90 and @entity91 in the @entity92 ’ @entity90			1
@entity94 ’s @entity93 said : ‘ if all four win it will be our worst day in @entity2 history			1
they are bound to be popular and linked in accumulators			0
’ @entity12 says : ‘ there are loads of different opinions and i ’d love to know what the answer is			1
i have watched the video hundreds of times			0
‘ it is one of the hardest things i have had to deal with			0
i had run the race scenario through my head so many times and that was the only one i had not thought of			0
‘ i was prepared for anything else — to finish second or even to fall off			0
to see him finish as strongly as he did , if things had gone his way he could have won			2
luckily , the owners were very kind			0
they did not make me hang around ( in the unsaddling enclosure ) afterwards			0
we talked about what had happened on another day			0
‘ i just wanted to sit down and put a towel over my head in the weighing room			0
‘ the only certainty is that i am now able to deal with defeat and disappointment better than i was			2
that is the experience of growing up			0
’ since last year ’s @entity90 , @entity0 has won all of his five races , four of them this season			1
he gained plaudits for his impressive victory in @entity2 ’s @entity132 in december but was less impressive when being forced to dig deeper than expected by @entity39 in his final prep at @entity134			1
but @entity12 says that is not a concern , adding : ‘ i would n’t say we have drawn a line through @entity134 because we learned that he does n’t want heavy ground			1
he would not run on it that bad again			0
‘ we also learned when things are not going right he is able to win from a bad situation			0
we now know if it was a dogfight in the champion he could cope			0
i loved his performance in the @entity132			2
he jumped the last upsides and put four lengths between him and @entity40			0
’ @entity12 says he is now able to deal with defeat and disappointment much better victory on tuesday afternoon would be made even more satisfying given the familial nature of the challenge			1
since last year ’s meeting , @entity12 , whose two @entity2 winners include @entity0 in the 2013 @entity158 ’ @entity36 , has been appointed stable jockey to champion trainer @entity161 , the best job in jump racing			1
it means a string of good rides lined up this week , including @entity167 in this afternoon ’s @entity168 and @entity169 in thursday ’s @entity170			2
but he admits he does not know if he would have accepted such riding riches had he been made to leave the star in his father ’s stable behind			2
‘ it ’s a very interesting question and i could not give an answer , ’ @entity12 says			1
‘ i have been lucky to win a lot of big races but @entity0 is spectacular — one of the best i have ever ridden			1
@entity180 ’s big chance of the week			2
to do it as a family would be a dream			0
he goes there in good form			0
‘ i just hope last year was n’t supposed to be his year			2

@entity0 and @entity12 looking to avenge last year 's defeat
since the @entity90 , @entity0 has won all five of his races
@entity0 drew plaudits for victory in @entity2 ’s @entity132
