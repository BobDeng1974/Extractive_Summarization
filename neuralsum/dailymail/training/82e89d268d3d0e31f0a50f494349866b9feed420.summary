heavyweight champion looked on as punches were thrown feminist group staged nude protest at the opening of @entity5 allegations of corruption in country where opposition leader is jailed mps brawled ahead of vote to endorse new prime minister heavyweight champion @entity13 was about the only one not swinging punches as fists flew in the @entity17 parliament for a second day running			1
mps wrestled with each other following controversial elections in october and the brawl erupted as a vote on the ruling @entity25 ' nomination for speaker was about to be announced			1
opposition and pro-presidential lawmakers grappled with each other in a mass of bodies around the main rostrum in parliament but @entity13 , leader of the @entity34 , was not involved			1
the violent scenes were similar to yesterday when the new session of the @entity17 parliament got off to a dramatic start with mps brawling on the floor of the chamber while a topless protest against corruption was staged outside			1
teamwork : @entity17 's parliament has seen several physical confrontations in recent years amid bitter confrontation between opposition and pro-government camps squaring up : the tension of the situation was visible on some lawmaker 's faces tension : the men pulled each other 's clothing as the violent drama broke out members of feminist group @entity96 , whose motto is ' we came , we undressed , we conquered ' , stripped naked down to just black pants and knee - high black socks in temperatures of minus @entity101			1
their stunt was an attempt to draw attention to the plight of opposition leader and ex-premier @entity107 who was jailed for crimes not recognised in the @entity109 as punishable by prison			1
before being hauled away by police , the @entity96 protesters claimed parliament , which yesterday met for the first time since the ' flawed ' october elections in the country , was a ' stable ' for the ' horses of oligarchs '			2
inside parliament , the opposition nationalist @entity119 chased and manhandled two mps , a father and son , in a bid to prevent them taking the oath			1
making a stand : police officers detain a @entity96 activist protesting in front of the @entity5 blockade : members of opposition parties block the door to @entity5 during a day of violence and tension getting physical : the three main opposition parties have ruled out any coalition with the ruling party of the @entity25 protest : the women were demonstrating over alleged corruption in the country , referring to @entity5 as a ' stable ' for the ' horses of oligarchs ' former @entity17 prime minister @entity107 is the leader of the main opposition party , @entity144 , also known as ' fatherland '			1
she lost the @entity17 presidential election to @entity52 in 2010 and has since faced a number of criminal charges			2
@entity107 was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2011 after being found guilty of abuse of office when brokering a gas deal with @entity153 in 2009			2
the @entity154 and other international organisations have ruled the conviction as ' justice being applied selectively under political motivation '			0
@entity107 is currently being held in @entity159 , where she is receiving treatment at a hospital after being diagnosed with a spinal disc herniation			0
she is appealing to the @entity163 against her conviction			0
the @entity17 government commissioned a team of @entity168 lawyers to compile a dossier on the case to use in its defence at the appeal			0
but the @entity173 reports the dossier states the trial was ' flawed ' and would not have met the requirements of a @entity109 court			0
@entity178 , former @entity179 counsel for president @entity180 and the dossier lead author , said : ' we concluded that there were ways in which @entity107 was not given a fair trial			0
' a legal expert told the newspaper the procedural violations would have led ' to a cancellations of the verdict ' in the @entity109			0
they were physically ejected from the chamber by opposition deputies who accused them of defecting to the ruling coalition			2
the procedural wrangling at the opening of the new parliament threatened to push back a key vote on whether @entity200 will be endorsed for a new term as prime minister			1
the vote will be the first test of the support for president @entity52 , who re-nominated @entity200			2
but when the speaker formally announced that @entity200 and his government were present , the chamber echoed to opposition cries of ' @entity211 ! @entity211 ! ' ( @entity212 ! ) mps from @entity107 's party wore black jerseys with her portrait on the front and the phrase ' freedom to @entity220 ' on the back			1
@entity107 remains in prison after being sentenced to seven years in prison in 2011 for alleged abuse of office over a gas deal with @entity153			0
@entity52 's pro-business @entity25 and their allies enjoyed a strong majority in the last parliament , which allowed them to push through changes to the electoral law and a law on use of the @entity153 language that sparked street protests			0
despite losing seats in the october elections , the results were seen as a consolidation of president @entity52 's power as his party still remained the biggest in parliament			0
most analysts said they believed horse - trading would ensure enough support from independents and others to secure the required 226 or more seats			0
but the new opposition line - up , whose leaders have ruled out any coalition with the @entity25 , quickly showed their teeth			2
deputies from the three main opposition parties surrounded the speaker 's rostrum , effectively blocking activation of the electronic system which would allow deputies to vote on @entity200 's nomination and the appointment of parliamentary officials			1
after a prolonged stand - off , both sides went home agreeing to resume business on thursday , according to the @entity269			0
separately , the government put off a meeting scheduled for thursday morning			0
imprisonment : @entity274 's president @entity273 , left , holds the hand of jailed @entity17 opposition leader @entity107 during her visit to a hospital in @entity159 injuries : opposition leader @entity107 showing bruising on her forearm in the @entity283 penitentiary colony for women in @entity159 earlier this year demonstration : supporters of jailed @entity17 opposition leader @entity107 protest against her conviction near the @entity288 , in @entity289 , @entity17			1
