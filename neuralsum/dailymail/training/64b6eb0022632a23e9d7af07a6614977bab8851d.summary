by @entity0 health experts have issued a warning to parents after a primary school started selling @entity6 six - inch rolls in its canteen			1
students at @entity10 primary school in @entity11 can now buy the fast food subs twice a week , despite concerns over the amount of fat and sugar in its products			1
the idea was the brainchild of a mother of two pupils at the school - who is also the owner of a nearby franchise - and comes after teachers failed to find volunteers to staff the canteen			1
fast food chain , @entity6 , and @entity28 has joined together , serving their students subway twice a week however , the move has concerned @entity31 of @entity33 spokeswoman @entity32 , who fears children could get bad eating habits if they have access to @entity6 at school			1
' it is important to not establish the habit in the first place because it is hard to break			0
' ms @entity32 told the @entity43			0
bad eating habits can lead to obesity in children ' hopefully this does n't open the gates for allowing all sorts of fast food			1
' under the dietary guidelines for @entity53 children it is recommended that children only consumer zero to two serves of extra food a day , if the child is n't doing physical activity that consumption is zero			2
' a meatball sub option would come under an extra in the saturated fat category			0
' what we would prefer to see is offering yoghurt or fruit which would tick the dairy and fruit requirements , not a cookie or juice			2
' ms @entity32 added having @entity6 is not always unhealthy , as long as serve sizes are strictly monitored			2
students at @entity10 can order four or six - inch subs and can also buy a cookie or a juice , according @entity75			1
in @entity33 , the government - backed @entity77 scheme offers guidelines about what food schools in the state should serve			1
the rules ban high fat , high sugar and heavily processed foods in canteens			0
@entity88 , president of @entity89 , said it was quite clear what should and should not be sold to students			2
she added more schools in @entity33 are outsourcing canteens because volunteers are hard to find			0
@entity95 in @entity11 signed a deal with @entity6 after failing to find canteen volunteers ' there is a lack of volunteers ... there is not a massive attraction of helping in canteens in a voluntary capacity			1
some schools have had to close their canteens , while others have had to outsource , ' she told @entity75			0
' the healthy eating regulations have kicked in which is a good thing , but the capacity to have big turnover with healthy foods has diminished as a result			0
neighbouring school , @entity114 , shares its canteen with @entity10 but has not employed @entity6			1
' we follow the healthy eating policy from the government , ' principle @entity117 said			0
' we have n't felt the need to go down that path , there would be a consulting process with the governing body of the school			0
' @entity6 did n't returns calls from @entity43			2
