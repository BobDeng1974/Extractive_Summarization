it looks more like the transport of choice for a @entity4 villain than a wheelchair			2
but one inventive engineer has turned a wheelchair into his very own hot seat - by fitting it with a flamethrower			2
@entity12 's eccentric creation can spit fire over 35 feet - the length of a typical bus			1
@entity12 , from @entity36 , @entity37 , said : ' i love fire and wheelchairs so i thought why not put them together			1
' @entity43 wheelchair idea started when i found a rescue helicopter seat in the @entity46 boneyard			1
idea : he decided to invent the wheelchair after an appearance on @entity51 show @entity52 ' as soon as i spotted it i knew it would be the perfect fit for my flame throwing chair project			2
' i would like to see some street gang member mess with someone in one of my chairs			0
' @entity12 , who funds his projects by working as a dental equipment engineer , added : ' almost every wheelchair user i have met loves my work and says i am on the right path			1
' it keeps my dreams alive building these chairs and getting them out to deserving people who need them			0
' why not have a fully functional wheelchair and have it show your personality just like a teenager with their first car			0
' his unusual interest was sparked by an appearance on @entity82 bbc2 show robot wars where he spent time talking to staff in the special effects department at the show 's studios			0
he said : ' they showed the stuff they were building in their shops and it had a big impact on how i design			0
' i began building with ideas i had in my head and not being concerned with what others were doing or thinking about			0
' when i am not working i spend all of my time in the garage designing and building custom wheelchairs and one of a kind machines			0
' in the past i was able to donate a few chairs each year to people who really need them so hope to build cool machines full time for deserving people some day			2
' work in progress : the chair is pictured in @entity12 's workshop while he built it			1
it took a month to put together ready to go : the customised chair pictured in the workshop ready for a test drive			1

the chair took @entity12 , 52 , a month and $ 1,000 to build
he made the chair from a helicopter seat and electric golf cart
@entity12 , from @entity36 , @entity37 , has dubbed the chair the @entity19
