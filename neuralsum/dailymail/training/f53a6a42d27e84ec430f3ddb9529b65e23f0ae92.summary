@entity0 could soon become a popular destination for large cruise ships if plans for a new passenger terminal in @entity5 move forward			1
it is hoped that the mooring at @entity8 would open in 2017 and become the capital ’s first new terminal since the closure of the @entity12 in 1981			1
the hub would allow ships up to 820ft long to stop near popular tourist attractions such as the @entity16 and @entity17 , the @entity18 reported			1
smaller cruise ships can dock alongside @entity20 after sailing past @entity22 's raised bascules new plans from @entity25 are to be submitted to @entity5 council within weeks and show that the mooring would be used for the start and finish of cruises , the newspaper reported			1
@entity25 has not revealed the cost of the new terminal , and lead architect @entity33 said a previous design failed to meet the requirements			0
he told @entity18 : ‘ in particular we have increased the size of the terminal building to accommodate baggage handling for passengers embarking and disembarking and to improve the overall experience within the terminal			2
‘ we have altered the access for vessel servicing , as longer stays mean that the cruise ships will need to load and unload stores and provisions			0
’ a terminal that can accommodate large ships would provide a boost for tourism by bringing more cruise options closer to @entity0 and delivering thousands of visitors to the city every year			2
a new cruise ship passenger terminal would be located near the @entity16 and @entity17 according to @entity18 , vessels expected to use the terminal include @entity60 ’s 36,000 - ton @entity59 , which is 682ft long and can accommodate 540 passengers and 376 crew			2
but @entity63 should not expect to see some of the world ’s largest ships because the @entity66 is not deep enough to accommodate them			1
cruise ships of up to 682ft in length currently dock at @entity70 , a floating terminal where passengers have to board and disembark using a launch			0
ships up to 518ft can moor alongside @entity20 after sailing past @entity22 ’s raised bascules			0
earlier this month , authorities in @entity77 , @entity75 overturned a ban on giant cruise ships passing through the centre of the canal city			0
the ban imposed last november applied to cruise ships of more than 96,000 gross tons and limited the number of ships of 40,000 tons or more to five per day .			0

it is hoped the new terminal would open in 2017 at @entity8
ships up to 820ft long would stop near the @entity16

new plans will be submitted within weeks to @entity5 council
