accidentally exposing yourself in pictures posted on @entity2 may sound like a tricky thing to do - but it appears to happen much more frequently than you would think			2
these embarrassing images were all posted online for the world to see by @entity2 sellers who thought it was a good idea to take pictures of their merchandise in the nude			1
unfortunately for them , their reflections have been caught in mirrors , cd covers , tv and computer screens as they took pictures for the website			1
tv star : this @entity2 seller has captured themselves on the small screen while taking a picture of a television they wanted to sell on the website one @entity2 seller even managed to capture his entirely naked body in the reflection of a metal kettle but his manhood was strategically covered by his tripod and camera			1
and once these photos go up online , it wo n't be long before some eagle - eyed shoppers spot the blunder , as @entity2 seller @entity40 recently discovered			1
the 21 - year - old had accidentally included a naked view of herself when she posted a picture of a dress for sale on the website			2
she hung the mustard yellow skater dress by @entity50 on her wardrobe door to photograph it for listing			0
where 's @entity54 ? you have to look a bit harder to find this photo blunder in the mirror in the left corner oops , i did it again : this @entity2 seller has managed to capture her naked reflection in these two heavy metal cds a cheeky shot : this photographer did n't seem to notice someone exposing themselves in the background of the picture but when viewing the picture , she failed to notice her own reflection in the door mirror , camera in hand , and in just a black bra and no knickers			1
the post soon went viral and despite @entity81 ' attempt to have it removed , it is now all over the internet			0
@entity81 , from @entity83 , told @entity84 : ' it 's so embarrassing			0
it is such a dizzy , stupid thing to do and now the whole world 's seen me in the nude			0
' i put it on @entity2 last saturday morning and realised straight away so ended the sale			0
but what i did n't realise was that people could still it on the site			0
that picture 's a little bit overexposed : this @entity2 seller does n't take the reflection from the camera flash into account in this image not the sharpest image : a seller tries to demonstrate the quality of the tv but ends up also sharing the contents of their living room snap happy : this seller got so carried away with taking pictures for the site , they failed to notice the very clear naked view of themselves ' i reported it to @entity2 and they took it down , but by then it had gone viral			2
my boyfriend @entity117 thinks the whole thing is hilarious			0
' the blunder sparked a flurry of fake @entity2 sale ads for the yellow dress with fictional characters accidentally making an appearance earlier this week			1
one @entity2 user went to the added effort of posting several pictures featuring @entity128 in his role as mr @entity130 in the first @entity132 film modelling the yellow dress the original image and mock - ups have since been shared on @entity136 with the hash tag # ebayyellowskaterdress			2
mirror , mirror : @entity40 , from @entity83 , did not realise she had captured herself half - naked in a mirror when she snapped the dress to sell on @entity2 bit more demure : she re-listed the item on @entity2 and this time covered up with a black coat			1
it attracted bids of Â£ 153 , 911 after the original picture went viral			0
