by @entity0 sergeant @entity1 , who was believed to be @entity3 's oldest surviving prisoner of war , has died five days after turning 100 the man believed to be @entity3 's oldest surviving prisoner of war , who was held captive at the camp immortalised in @entity6 , has died five days after turning 100			1
sergeant @entity1 was one of the few remaining @entity3 survivors of the infamous @entity9 camp in @entity10 , @entity11 , where 76 men attempted to escape to their freedom in 1944			1
the airman was based there for 11 months , during the four years he was held captive by @entity16 during the @entity17			1
sgt @entity1 was captured in august 1941 , after his bomber was shot down and crash - landed in a field during a raid in @entity22 , @entity23			1
during his captivity , sgt @entity1 endured forced marches across @entity26 , as the @entity16 moved prisoners from the @entity28 who were advancing from the east			1
the airman , from @entity31 , had already had a fortunate escape during the war , when the @entity34 were strafed by @entity3 fighter planes which mistook them for @entity16			1
after the war , sgt @entity1 worked as a local government officer			1
he was in good health until he developed pneumonia shortly before his 100th birthday			2
he died one week later			2
it was only after his death that sgt @entity1 's family suspected he might be the oldest living pow			1
the previous oldest surviving prisoner from the @entity17 had been squadron leader @entity45 who died last year , aged 98			1
like many other veterans , sgt @entity1 rarely spoke about his experiences of war			1
but his daughter , @entity50 , was able to piece together her father 's war records with the help of the website			2
the family then approached the military genealogy website , @entity57			0
mrs @entity50 , 58 , said : ' over the years my father never really wanted to talk about the war that much			2
' he was a very quiet and stoical man and i think that was due to the effect the war had on him			0
' but last year we read about @entity45 and we knew that dad was of a similar age to him and that he was a @entity67 for much of the war as well			1
' before he passed away he told us a little bit about his part in the war and we have managed to find out more information from genealogy website @entity57			0
' sgt @entity1 served with @entity72 based at @entity73 , @entity74 , and crewed @entity76 bombers on raids on mainland @entity26 in the aftermath of the @entity80 evacuation of 1940			1
mrs @entity50 said her father could easily have been killed during the near - miss in 1941 , just before he was captured			0
the airman , from @entity31 , was held captive by @entity16 for four years during the @entity17			1
he died five days after turning 100 , after developing pneumonia about half of the men , including @entity86 , dived for cover in a ditch on one side of the road			1
many of the men who sheltered on the opposite side were killed			0
she said : ' he found himself to one side of the crashed plane and he told us he overheard the other two crew members saying ' i think @entity100 has had it this time '			2
' he got up , walked around to the other side of the aircraft and tapped them on the shoulder and said ' i am still here "			0
' weeks later , during the raid in @entity23 , the aircraft in which sgt @entity1 was flying made a belly - landing in the field			2
although the three - man crew survived , they were all taken prisoner			0
the captured crew would have then been interrogated for information before being sent to prisoner of war camps			0
mrs @entity50 said : ' i remember when dad and i drove back from a @entity119 service at our local church a few years ago and @entity122 had been one of the carols			0
' he told me it reminded him of his first @entity119 in captivity when they apparently had little food and were frozen and the @entity16 guards sang @entity122 outside their cells to taunt them			2
' sgt @entity1 was held captive at @entity9 for 11 months , from may 1942			1
the infamous camp was where ' @entity6 ' - the single greatest freedom attempt by @entity67 in the war - took place sgt @entity1 was moved to @entity9 at @entity10 , @entity11 , in may 1942 where he spent 11 months			1
in july 1944 , he took part in a forced march west from a prison camp at @entity139 in @entity140 to @entity141 in @entity11			1
the marches involved walking for days on end with little or no food , often being beaten or bayoneted by their guards			0
the previous oldest surviving prisoner from the @entity17 was squadron leader @entity45 who died last year , aged 98 sgt @entity1 met his wife @entity148 before the war			1
they had to wait until 1945 to get married and went on to have three children - @entity152 , 66 , @entity153 , 63 and @entity50 - as well as six grandchildren and a great - grandchild			0
mrs @entity50 said : ' i believe that @entity159 , after all his experiences of war , was very happy to have a wife who he adored , and family , and that providing stability for all of us was the cornerstone of his life			0
' @entity168 , managing director of @entity57 , said : ' following a lifetime of silence on the subject , @entity167 's daughter got in touch with us for information that her father had kept to himself			0
' we found out the previous oldest pow died on january 4 , 2013 - he was a little over a month older than @entity167 and the chances of there being anyone else between those two are fairly low			1
' he aded : ' you ca n't underestimate the debt this country owes people like @entity186 ' after the fall of @entity80 , bombing raids on mainland @entity26 were the only way @entity3 could strike back at @entity16 for a while until the desert war and the eventual invasion of @entity193			2
' @entity194 was one of the riskiest jobs of the war			0
@entity1 would have seen a lot of colleagues either killed , wounded or taken prisoner when he volunteered for it			2
' we 're losing a tangible link to the past every time someone like @entity100 passes away			0
it 's wonderful to think someone who spent five years of his life , at a relatively tender age , suffering deprivation in the hands of the enemy not only survived the war but went on to lead such a long and happy life			1
' now he deserves to be remembered for what he did for the country			0
' it is thought that @entity216 , from @entity217 , @entity218 , is now @entity3 's oldest pow still alive			1
mr @entity216 , who was held by the @entity219 at the notorious @entity221 camp in @entity222 in @entity17 , has just turned 100			2
the ' @entity6 ' from @entity9 was the single greatest freedom attempt by @entity67 in the war			2
among the 50 who were shot was @entity226 , the mastermind of the plot which hoped to free over 200 men			0
some 26 of the 76 who tried to escape were returned to the camp while three made ‘ home runs ’ to @entity3			0
the original plan was for three tunnels , codenamed @entity234			0
but @entity234 was discovered soon after it was started , and it was decided to use @entity237 to store the spoil from @entity239 as it was dug			0
the story of the escape was made into a film in 1963 , starring actors @entity243 , @entity245 and @entity246			0
decades later , the 2000 film @entity248 was based on the movie .			0
