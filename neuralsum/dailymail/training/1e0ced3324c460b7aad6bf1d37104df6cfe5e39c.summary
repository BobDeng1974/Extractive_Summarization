it will become a familiar sight as the season wears on			0
every time @entity4 are awarded a free - kick in the general vicinity of the penalty box , a debate will ensue			1
@entity9 will fancy his chances and @entity11 will think it 's well within his range			2
@entity14 will remind everyone that he has a good track record and @entity17 will try to pull rank as captain			2
@entity20 may well join the conversation too and others will throw in their thoughts			0
if competition for places in @entity4 's starting line - up is intense for the louis van gaal - acticos , then the struggle to become regular free - kick taker is going to be really interesting			1
@entity30 has plenty of players capable of striking a set - piece at @entity4 @entity9 got his @entity4 career off to a flying start by scoring direct from a free - kick in the 4 - 0 win over @entity38 last sunday - though he may not have meant it @entity14 is also a fine striker of a set - piece and is a candidate to take them regularly for @entity4 each of those five players is capable of taking a good free - kick but , of course , only one can win the argument each time			1
new £ 60m signing @entity9 staked an early claim when he swung in @entity4 's opening goal from a wide free - kick against @entity38 on sunday			1
he succeeded in delivering the ball into the ' corridor of uncertainty ' , deceived goalkeeper @entity54 when everyone else missed it and found the far corner of the net			0
whether he meant it barely matters			0
trouble is , @entity62 's qualities with the dead ball are unproven			2
he may well be an expert but with @entity64 and @entity65 in the @entity67 side he did n't get much of a look in			0
as captain , @entity17 may be able to pull rank when it comes to taking free - kicks @entity11 is also capable of scoring direct from a free - kick new loan signing @entity20 can also strike the dead ball well goals and assists from free - kicks since the start of the 2011 - 2012 season : @entity17 – 5 goals ( 1 assist ) @entity14 – 4 ( 3 ) @entity11 – 2 ( 3 ) @entity9 – 1 ( 2 ) @entity20 – 1 ( 0 ) source : @entity82 and while he can evidently deliver a killer ball from the wide positions , there are better candidates when the ball is close to the box in a central position			1
@entity14 is chief among them - he has scored four goals directly from free - kicks for @entity94 and @entity4 since 2011			1
two of them came at the tail end of last season , either side of @entity101 's sacking , against @entity102 and @entity103			0
in that same period of time , @entity14 has also contributed three assists from free - kicks , adding to his worth with from set - piece situations			1
but many have predicted @entity14 will be the unfortunate one to lose his place as @entity111 somehow tries to cram all his expensive players into his line - up , so step forward @entity17			2
the @entity4 captain has curled home five free - kicks over the last three - and - a - bit seasons and is among the best from the 18 - 30 yard range			2
@entity62 practises his free - kicks at @entity121 prior to the match with @entity38 @entity62 's ( not in picture ) free - kick evaded everyone in the penalty box and deceived @entity54 @entity14 was on target from open play in the four - goal demolition of @entity38 last season he found the target against @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 with direct free - kicks , rare moments of joy as @entity101 struggled to gather points early in the campaign			1
and now that he has the armband , @entity17 will have that little bit extra clout in those all - important negotiations at free - kicks			2
but he 's by no means the only capable front man			0
@entity11 is also an accomplished striker of a free - kick - just ask @entity132 , who were on the receiving end of his accurate boot in the last minute of the december 2012 meeting at the @entity150			1
@entity17 curls home a free - kick in @entity4 's 2 - 0 win over @entity131 at @entity121 last season @entity17 celebrates his free - kick goal against @entity94 in the @entity156 quarter - final in march 2013 @entity11 curls home his stoppage time free - kick against @entity132 in 2012 the @entity159 ca n't quite match @entity17 's record - he has scored with just two since 2011 - but is willing and able if needed			1
last but not least is @entity20			0
he 'll be more use in the box to get his head on the cross or pick up the scraps but the hotshot loanee striker can score direct from set pieces too , as shown by this one for @entity168 against @entity169 in october 2012			0
the stats suggest @entity14 is the best choice but of course each situation will be different			0
this is one argument @entity111 might leave to the players to sort out amongst themselves .			0

@entity30 is blessed with plenty of accomplished free - kick takers at @entity4
@entity9 scored direct from a set - piece in the 4 - 0 win over @entity38 last *weekend*
@entity14 has scored four goals direct from free - kicks since 2011
@entity17 found the net from three dead ball situations last season
@entity11 and @entity20 are also good free - kick takers
