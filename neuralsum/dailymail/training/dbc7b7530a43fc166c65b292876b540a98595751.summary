pop star @entity0 has attacked @entity2 shadow minister @entity1 after he criticised the number of posh actors and musicians @entity6 @entity0 has fired off another shot in his war of words with outspoken mp @entity1 – after the @entity2 shadow minister criticised the number of posh actors and musicians in @entity12			1
@entity2 mp @entity1 claimed @entity12 culture was ' dominated ' by stars like @entity0 and @entity16 who went to expensive boarding schools			1
the remarks , which come in the wake of @entity16 's best actor @entity21 nomination last week , sparked a furious response from @entity24 - educated @entity0			1
the @entity26 star accused mr @entity1 of being a ' prejudiced wazzock ' who was using the ' politics of jealousy ' to win votes			1
mr @entity1 hit back at the pop star 's online attack - criticising him for being ' so blooming precious '			1
but 40 - year - old @entity0 reignited the row this morning - taking to @entity34 to accuse the @entity2 mp of failing to help people from ordinary backgrounds achieve success			1
in a message posted this morning on @entity0 ’s official twitter page , he wrote : ‘ to help people at the bottom of the tree join those near the top , give them a ladder , not a bow and arrow			1
’ the message was more restrained than his online rant yesterday , in which he accused the @entity2 mp of being a ' prejudiced wazzock '			1
in his letter to mr @entity1 , @entity2 's shadow culture minister , @entity0 claimed that the £ 30,000 a year boarding school he attended did nothing to help him break into the music industry			1
the @entity57 award - winner also claims that people in the music industry tried to get him to change his accent so he sounded less posh			2
@entity0 opened his letter to mr @entity1 by accusing him of being a ' classist gimp ' , despite the fact that the @entity2 mp himself was privately educated at £ 20,000 a year @entity65 before attending @entity66			1
in @entity0 's letter , he wrote : ' i happened to go to a boarding school			1
no one helped me at boarding school to get into the music business			0
' he added : ' i bought my first guitar with money i saved from holiday jobs ( sandwich packing ! )			0
i was taught the only four chords i know by a friend			0
' no one at school had any knowledge or contacts in the music business , and i was expected to become a soldier or a lawyer or perhaps a stockbroker			0
so alien was it , that people laughed at the idea of me going into the music business , and certainly no one was of any use			0
' @entity0 said even in the army , which he joined after university , he was told that trying to become a pop star was a ' mad idea '			1
he wrote : ' and when i left the army , going against everyone 's advice , everyone i met in the @entity12 music industry told me there was no way it would work for me because i was too posh			2
one record company even asked if i could speak in a different accent			0
( i told them i could try @entity110 )			0
' every step of the way , my background has been against me succeeding in the music business			0
and when i have managed to break through , i was still scoffed at for being too posh for the industry			0
' the 40 - year - old @entity0 reignited the row this morning - taking to @entity34 to accuse @entity2 mp @entity1 of failing to help people from ordinary backgrounds achieve success			1
@entity2 mp @entity1 ( left ) - privately educated himself - claimed @entity12 culture was ' dominated by @entity16 ( right ) and @entity0 and their ilk ' who went to expensive boarding schools he added : ' you come along , looking for votes , telling working class people that posh people like me do n't deserve it , and that we must redress the balance			1
' but it is your populist , envy - based , vote - hunting ideas which make our country crap , far more than me and my s * * * songs , and my plummy accent			2
' i got signed in @entity143 , where they do n't give a stuff about , or even understand what you mean by me and ' my ilk ' , you prejudiced wazzock , and i worked my a * * * off			0
' what you teach is the politics of jealousy			2
rather than celebrating success and figuring out how we can all exploit it further as the @entity143 do , you instead talk about how we can hobble that success and ' level the playing field '			0
' perhaps what you 've failed to realise is that the only head - start my school gave me in the music business , where the @entity162 majority of people are not from boarding school , is to tell me that i should aim high			0
perhaps it protected me from your kind of narrow - minded , self - defeating , lead - us - to - a - dead - end , remove - the - ' g ' - from - ' gb ' thinking , which is to look at others ' success and say , ' it 's not fair '			2
' @entity0 signed off his letter : ' up yours			2
' but mr @entity1 accused the pop star of being ' blooming precious '			1
in a letter in response , the mp wrote : ' i 'm not knocking your success			0
i even contributed to it by buying one of your albums			0
i 'm not knocking @entity16 , either			2
he was the best @entity182 i have ever seen			0
' if you 'd read the whole of my interview , you 'd have seen that i make the point that the people who subsidise the arts the most are artists themselves			0
of course that includes you			0
' but it is a statement of the blindingly obvious that that is far tougher if you come from a poor family where you have to hand over your holiday earnings to help pay the family bills			2
