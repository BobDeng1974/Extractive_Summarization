gaffe - prone vice president @entity0 has learned a thing or two during his 64 months in the @entity4 administration , including the need to avoid broadcasting f - bombs like the one he let loose on mar 23 , 2010			1
that was the day the president triumphantly announced the signing of the @entity12			2
but @entity0 unwittingly stole the spotlight by introducing @entity4 , embracing him and saying – loudly enough for the podium microphone to capture it – ' this is a big f * * * ing deal			1
' ' [ a ] piece of advice about that " @entity21 " stuff : assume every microphone is on , ' @entity0 told a crowd gathered on monday at the starting line of the annual @entity25 , a cycling event that raises money for wounded - veterans charities			1
' i just want you to know , i did n't intentionally say that , ' he added , according to @entity55			0
' i actually turned and i said , " mr. president , " and i whispered in his ear			0
unfortunately , i was looking in the direction of one guy who could actually read lips — not a joke			0
because no one picked it up at the time and one of the reporters read lips			0
' ' thank @entity68 my mother was gone or i 'd have been one dead vice president			1
' his words , however , were clearly audible and went out on every broadcast network covering the event			0
the @entity74 reported at the time that ' @entity0 appeared to be offering that perspective to @entity4 privately			0
' moments later , then - @entity77 press secretary @entity76 tweeted , ' and yes , mr. vice president , you 're right			2
' a ride 2 recovery coordinator who introduced @entity0 playfully warned the crowd that ' for those of you who do n't know , @entity0 is famous for some of his one liners			2
' ' there was a bill signing at the @entity77 ... and he said it was a " big f - ing deal			1
" and that was a quote ... if i may say , sir , @entity91 is a big f - ing deal			1
' the introduction also included the prediction that ' at some point in the future @entity0 is going to run for president again			2
' in response , @entity0 was seen making a dramatic sign of the cross on his body			2
@entity0 's mouth often out - runs his brain , as he proved in 2010 with an open microphone and an f - bomb @entity107 : @entity0 mugged for a camera with @entity4 to launch his @entity110 account , but was better - known for saying that in his home state of @entity113 , ' you can not go to a 7 - 11 or a @entity114 unless you have a slight @entity116 accent			1
' the vice president , who is mulling a @entity77 run in 2016 , also mentioned the controversy swirling around the @entity122 @entity121 , which is accused of using phony off - the - books waiting lists to mask its failure to provide timely health care to battle - tested servicemen and women			1
' that is a sacred obligation , and we ’re behind right now , ' the he conceded			0
' the @entity132 is having problems , and we ’ve got to get to the bottom of it			0
' ' this is a long - term commitment this nation has to make , ' @entity0 said , ' so it seems to me on this day we as @entity122 have to recommit ourselves not just with words but with deeds			0

@entity0 told @entity50 charity bike riders that they he learned his lesson from the f - bomb he uttered on live television in 2010
' assume every microphone is on , ' he said , *recalling* his ' this is a big f * * * ing deal ' gaffe after the @entity12 bill signing
' thank @entity68 my mother was gone or i 'd have been one dead vice president ' he said
when he was introduced by a man who noted that he *planned* to run for president , @entity0 made the sign of the cross
