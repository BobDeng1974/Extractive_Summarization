undeterred : traffic was starting to build on the @entity18 near a rainy cambridge at the start of the @entity8 getaway the days ahead : do n't forget to bring an umbrella on your @entity8 trip meanwhile high winds swept from the @entity26 up to @entity27 , making it feel even colder			1
the @entity5 now believes this spring will be the coldest since 1979 , with the mean @entity30 temperature estimated at @entity31 ( @entity32 ) , well below the long - term average for this time of year of @entity34 ( 46f )			1
forecaster @entity35 of @entity36 said : ‘ we have got a low pressure system , which is spreading from the @entity39			0
‘ that ’s what ’s bringing these showers and keeping the skies pretty cloudy			0
it ’s also got some quite brisk winds , so all of those areas in the @entity26 and @entity48 are feeling quite chilly			0
’ but hardy @entity30 refused to be deterred by the grim conditions , with millions taking to the roads yesterday to make the most of the getaway , as supermarkets stocked up on barbecue food			1

@entity157 nectar : @entity158 , quality manager at @entity159 , inspects the blossom from one of the apple trees at the orchards in @entity164 , @entity99 silver lining : the blossom has arrived late , but inspectors say its strength is encouraging looks promising : all that 's needed now is some warm weather to ensure the blossom trees bear fruit , cider - makers say closer look : bad weather last year crippled the harvest and proved disastrous for growers ‘ tomorrow will see a cold start and a chance of grass frost , but once the sun comes out it will warm up quickly and see temperatures of around 17c or @entity144			2
’ @entity102 , which had snow this week , can also look forward to some much - needed sunshine over the course of the bank holiday , forecasters said			0
on monday , @entity188 and @entity189 will get the best of the weather , where temperatures could climb as high as @entity193 ( @entity194 ) but cloud and rain will move across the country from the west later in the day			1
making the best of it : adorable 18 - month - old @entity201 was wrapped up in a winter coat and woolly hat to play on @entity205 beach at the start of the @entity207 today newcomer : one of the fluffy chicks takes some faltering steps under the watchful gaze of an adult flamingo weather impact : the cold weather meant the greater flamingos seen at this @entity217 nature reserve today were late to lay their eggs chilly : a greater flamingo looks over one of four chicks born at the reserve , where the team are expecting many more to hatch in the coming weeks welcome addition : the greater flamingos at the reserve have been bred in captivity and are friendly and sociable birds , staff say curious : the fluffy chick wanders around the enclosure , where the greater flamingos - traditionally from the @entity235 and parts of @entity237 , nest on bark chippings over the half - term break next week the weather is expected to be unsettled , with a mixture of heavy showers and sunshine			1
the mixed weather appears to have left supermarkets in a quandary			0
@entity248 forecast sales of sausages to increase by 144 per cent and barbecue food by 84 per cent , come @entity251			0
however , bosses at the chain have also called in an extra 100,000 pairs of wellies ahead in case the weather takes a turn for the worse			0
