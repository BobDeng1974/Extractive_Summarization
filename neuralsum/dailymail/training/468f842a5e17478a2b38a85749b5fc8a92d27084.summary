you could be forgiven for thinking @entity1 had forgotten where the goal is this season			0
the villains have n’t found the net in the @entity6 in five games and have the lowest goals scored total in the league – a measly 11			0
that ’s an average of 0.5 goals a game so far this season , eight short of @entity15 who are next on the list of goal - shy squads in the division			0
@entity22 v @entity21 was the choice of teams as the four strikers went head - to - head but , @entity1 strikers @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 , plus former striker @entity32 , took to @entity33 to prove to fans they still understand the aim of a striker ’s game			1
@entity29 has only scored three league goals this season , but he and former team mate @entity32 showed they both still have an eye for goal as they beat @entity30 and @entity31 5 - 4 in a thriller			2
@entity1 duo @entity30 and @entity31 showed they still have an eye for goal via @entity33 @entity29 pairs up with former @entity1 hit man @entity32 in @entity33 battle @entity30 and @entity31 made it interesting in the second of the best of three as they secured a win to ensure the match would go to a decider , thanks largely to a couple of @entity29 obtained red cards			1
but , @entity29 and @entity32 secured the win with a routine 3 - 0 victory over their fellow strike duo , who were forced to do press - ups as a forfeit for losing			0
@entity1 fans will now be hoping the trio will work out how to replicate the action on the pitch against @entity70 on sunday - a side that has scored more goals in @entity73 this season than they have ... @entity29 celebrating an @entity1 goal has been a rare sight this season @entity30 has been linked with a big move away , despite only scoring two league goals this campaign			1

@entity1 have only scored 11 @entity6 goals this season
they have failed to net in their previous five league games
strikers show fans they still know where the goal is via @entity33 battle
