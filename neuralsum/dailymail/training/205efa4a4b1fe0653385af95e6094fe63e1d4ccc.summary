the poorest people in society have eight fewer teeth by their seventies than the richest , a study has found			1
while it is already known that there is a strong link between socio - economic status and oral health , the research reveals the full extent of the problem			1
it shows a shocking discrepancy between the dental conditions enjoyed by the richest 20 per cent of society compared with the poorest			0
for those aged over 65 , the least well - off averaged eight fewer teeth than the richest – a quarter of a full set			1
the poorest people in society have eight fewer teeth by their seventies than the richest , a study has found more than 6,000 people aged 21 and over from all income groups were involved in the @entity25 study , published today in the @entity26			1
those with lower incomes , a lower occupational class , higher levels of deprivation and lower educational attainment had the worst oral health			1
this includes having more tooth decay , gum disease and tooth gaps , as well as having fewer teeth			1
but despite these social differences , the overall oral health of young @entity25 adults is much better than it used to be			1
the study was a collaboration between @entity43 , @entity43 upon @entity44 , @entity45 and the @entity46			0
professor @entity47 , head of the dental school at @entity43 , said : ' it 's probably not a big surprise that poorer people have worse dental health than the richest , but the surprise is just how big the differences can be and how it affects people			2
for those aged over 65 , the least well - off averaged eight fewer teeth than the richest – a quarter of a full set ( stock image ) ' eight teeth less on average is a huge amount and will have had a big impact			1
' dr @entity66 , senior lecturer at the @entity67 at @entity45 , said education was key			0
' in terms of the younger adults , we showed that it is not only being poor that affects their perceptions about their oral health and quality of life , but educational attainment can also make a major difference			1
' this has profound implications for policy as intervening in earlier life could have a significant long term effect on oral health , ' he said			1
@entity87 , professor of health economics at @entity89 , and the principal investigator on the @entity92 study , said the issue has not been given enough attention			2
' inequalities in oral health have not received the attention that they deserve			2
our study is an attempt to redress this balance			0
oral health contributes hugely to everyday wellbeing and addressing these inequalities may result in considerable improvements in quality of life for large numbers of individuals , ' he said			2
professor @entity107 , head of the @entity67 at @entity45 , referred to the policy implications of this research			0
' inequalities in oral health require urgent action by organisations such as @entity113 - in particular more needs to be done to tackle the underlying causes of oral diseases such as sugary diets , ' he said			1
one example is @entity118 , 68 , a shoemaker from @entity119 , who was a keen trombonist in a brass band			0
he lost all his teeth at a young age due to suffering from gum disease , primarily caused by poor oral hygiene , and has struggled ever since			2
he has never smoked regularly and says he did not have too much sugar in his diet			0
' you ca n't play the trombone without any teeth ' , he said			0
' i have had false teeth but they do n't last , so losing my teeth has made a big impact on my life			0
it costs a lot of money for false teeth			0
' when i was young we did n't have milk or eggs , or much other dairy , we had to eat powdered eggs			0
i 'm sure that has had an impact on how good my teeth were			0

for those over 65 , the least well - off averaged eight fewer teeth than richest
the @entity25 study is published today in the @entity26
it found those with lower incomes , lower occupational class , higher levels of deprivation and lower educational attainment had the worst oral health
