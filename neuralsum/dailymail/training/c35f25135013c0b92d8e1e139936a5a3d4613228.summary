by @entity0 published : 14:03 est , 2 september 2013 updated : 07:24 est , 3 september 2013 a giant prehistoric amphibian once burrowed underground to become dormant when water was scarce , according to a new study			1
@entity4 weighed half a tonne and was 10 feet long , but its environment had only two seasons : wet and dry			1
the @entity8 needed water for its lifestyle , but researchers have discovered the extremely long dry season 230 million years ago drove the species to burrow underground and go dormant			1

it needed water for its lifestyle , but researchers have discovered the extremely long dry season 230 million drove the species to burrow underground and go dormant the burrowing behaviour of @entity8 was recently discovered by @entity18 , of the @entity19 in @entity20 and the @entity21 in @entity22 , and @entity23 , also of the @entity21			1
their study , published in the @entity26 , examined both the overall structure of the skeleton of @entity8 as well as the microscopic structure of its bones			1
the broad , flat head , broad flat arm bones , wide hands , and large tail of @entity35 led the investigators to conclude that this species swam in lakes during the wet season			2
the broad , flat head ( pictured ) , broad flat arm bones , wide hands , and large tail of @entity35 led the investigators to conclude that this species swam in lakes during the wet season the @entity8 diagnosticus was thought to be a mostly aquatic animal			2
it had small limbs , sharp teeth and a large flat head			0
its diet was mainly fish which it captured with its wide jaws lined			0
@entity8 could reach up to 3m ( 10 feet ) long , weighed 454 kg and was one of the last large amphibians			0
many @entity8 mass graves have been found			0
researchers believe this was probably from creatures that grouped together in drying pools during drought			2
they also believe it used its broad , flat head and forearms to burrow under the ground when the dry season began			2
the conclusions were made following a study of cross-sections of @entity8 bones which have growth rings , called annuli			1
these annuli are similar to tree rings , where a band of light and a band of dark indicate one year of growth			1
in other early amphibians one annulus usually consists of a broad zone of rapid growth that indicates a wet season , followed by a thin band of slow growth , indicating a dry season			1
but in @entity8 , a period of prolonged slow growth was followed by a cessation of growth during the dry season			1
the study examined a cross-sections of @entity8 bones which have growth rings , called annuli			1
the above image shows annuli in femur samples of metoposaurus diagnosticus			0
a thick inner phase of fast growth is marked by @entity101 and a broad phase of slow growth can be seen in the middle left image ( a1 ) ‘ the histology of @entity8 long bones seems to be unique , ’ said lead author @entity104			1
‘ in our interpretation it corresponds to the two - seasonal climate with a short , more favourable wet season and a long dry part of the year when life conditions were worse			2
’ dr @entity114 , from the @entity115 who was not involved with this study said : ‘ this interpretation is interesting , but problematic in some respects			0
‘ this animal was much larger than any extant burrowing species i know of , and if it dug , i suspect that the snout and tail played a far greater role than the limbs , as we observe in most extant aquatic vertebrates			2

co-author dr @entity23 said : ‘ a common problem with these large amphibians is that you ca n't tell from the shape of their bones if they are grown or not ; sometimes the youngsters get described as a different species from the grown - ups			0
’ all of the specimens preserved at @entity148 in modern day @entity20 were juveniles			0
the smallest specimen was only one - year - old , while the largest specimen was four			0
adulthood in these large amphibians was usually reached around year seven			0
the researchers do not know if this mode of life was unique to juveniles or if adults also burrowed			0
dr @entity23 added : ‘ it amazes me time and again how much we can learn from these extinct animals			0
‘ the techniques we used have been around since the 1840s , but only in the last 20 years have researchers asked the right questions and drawn comparisons with living animals			0

@entity4 ' burrowing behaviour was *previously* *unknown*
researchers drew the conclusion after studying the amphibian *'s* skeleton
they also analysed growth rings in the bones , known as @entity180 , which revealed a period of *stunted* growth during dry spells
