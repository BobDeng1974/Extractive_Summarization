there was @entity37 , the ceramic artist who came up with the idea of the poppies , borrowed £ 1million to get them started and lost a finger producing them			1
he was accompanied by @entity182 , the theatre designer who brought them to life and devised dramatic flourishes such as ‘ @entity186 ’ , a surge of poppies over the drawbridge , and ‘ @entity190 ’ , the torrent of red gushing from the ramparts			0
a yeoman warder looked across the poppies before the ceremony took place , attended by tens of thousands from around the world all 888,246 poppies have now been planted in the dry 16 - acre moat , heralding the completion of the poignant memorial both are thrilled that these separate structures have now been bought by the government and will tour the country before enjoying a permanent home at the @entity208			1
‘ the best thing has been all the camaraderie , ’ said mr @entity37			2
for mr @entity182 , the most moving moment was being asked to read the names at a twilight @entity130 and learning of a great uncle killed in 1918			2
