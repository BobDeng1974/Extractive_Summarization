a prolific thief who was fitted with a @entity2 electronic tag after being released from prison has returned to jail after being traced to seven different burglaries during a three - week period			1
@entity7 , 26 , was one of the first criminals in @entity9 to receive the device as part of a @entity13 trial to replace the need for defendants to report to police stations or have nightly curfew checks			1
however , just three weeks after he was released from prison on november 20 last year , the tag traced him to the location of seven burglaries , including one just five days after he left prison			1
he has now been jailed for two years at @entity22 after admitting all seven burglaries			2
his accomplice , 25 - year - old @entity24 , has also been jailed for accompanying him on two of the burglaries			1

he has been jailed at @entity22 for two years , alongside his accomplice @entity24 , 25 ( right ) , who took part in two of the raids the court heard how detectives were able to place him at each burglary thanks to the electronic tag which was fitted with @entity2 ( gps ) accurate to ten metres			1
detective constable @entity35 , from @entity36 , said : ' as part of the pilot , @entity7 signed consent forms agreeing data could be taken from it and used in evidence should he be suspected of committing criminal offences			0
' many prisoners are allowed to complete part of their jail sentence in the community on licence but they must abide by strict conditions and if they breach those terms they can quickly expect to be back behind bars			0
' @entity7 is a prolific thief who , if he fails to change his ways , has a bleak future ahead of him and can expect to spend many years away from society			1
' this map shows the vicinity in which @entity7 committed the seven burglaries whilst wearing a tag five days after being released from prison on licence , @entity7 kicked his way into a house in @entity63 , @entity64 , before stealing laptops and a 42 - inch plasma tv			1

@entity7 's accomplice @entity24 , 25 , was also jailed last week after a jury found him guilty of joining him on the break - in , as well as at another in the @entity63 area of @entity64			1

@entity7 gained entry by kicking through @entity107 door panels and , from most homes , made off with jewellery , phones and other valuables			0
when police analysed the tag they discovered that minutes after one burglary , @entity7 went to a nearby alleyway where officers later found stolen property hidden in bushes			0
@entity120 also found @entity7 had entered a pawnbroker in the @entity102 area of the city , where officers recovered a gold bangle stolen from the break - in			2
cctv from the shop also showed @entity24 offering the nine - carat jewellery for sale			0
detectives also discovered a phone registered to @entity24 was used to contact a pawnbroker shortly after the 81 - year - old 's home was raided			1
a sim card linked to @entity7 was also found in a phone taken from a raid in @entity91 , @entity64			0
chief inspector @entity139 , of @entity36 who led the gps tag trial , said : ' the tag supports offenders who are serious about quitting crime and allows them to rebuild their life without the need to report to police stations or have the inconvenience of police officers knocking at their door late at night to check they 're complying with curfews			0
' the tag gives offenders more freedom as they do n't need to report to police stations or have the inconvenience of police officers knocking late at night to check they 're honouring curfews			0
' but as @entity7 has found to his cost it also affords irrefutable evidence should offenders slip back into old habits			0
