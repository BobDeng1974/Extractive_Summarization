former president @entity0 says in a rare interview that he would like to see his brother run for the @entity3 former @entity4 governor @entity0 says he has not yet made up his mind about running in 2016 @entity6 's and @entity7 likely to favour @entity0 and make him ideal @entity6 candidate @entity9 wonder whether @entity10 will also run again making it @entity12 again by @entity14 published : 15:38 est , 20 april 2013 updated : 15:50 est , 20 april 2013 with president @entity16 well into his second term in office , it 's never too early to contemplate who might be on the ballot in 2016			1
@entity10 is refusing to confirm at this early stage whether a 2016 run for the @entity9 is in the offing , but on the other side many see former @entity4 governor @entity0 as a likely candidate for the @entity6			1
certainly his brother and former president @entity26 is hoping @entity0 will make a run for it in just 43 months time			1
seeing triple : could @entity0 ( right ) be the third president @entity0 if he becomes the @entity6 's candidate in the 2016 election ? here he is pictured next to his brother former president @entity26 ( center ) and their father @entity33 ( left ) when asked if the country is ready for another @entity0 , president @entity0 told @entity37 ' that ’s for @entity0 to figure out , you know what i mean ? i would hope that people would judge [ him ] , if @entity0 were to run , on his merits and his track record			1
… so i hope he will run			0
' he does have plenty of thoughts when it comes to running for office : ' my first advice would be , do n’t be afraid of entering the arena , win or lose			0
it ’s a great experience			0
people are going to automatically not vote for you because of your name			0
on the other hand , people will listen to you because of your name , so i would n’t even worry about that			0
just go out there and tell people what ’s in your heart			0
' the former @entity4 governor has not yet made a decision about the race in 2016			1
he does not believe he will suffer from his brother 's low popularity during his two terms as president			2
preparation : could we expect to see more pictures like this of former @entity4 governor @entity0 ? well , yes if he decides to run for the @entity3 in 2016 ! familiar faces : some are predicting @entity10 to be the @entity9 candidate of choice come 2016 a recent @entity76 survey suggested that @entity0 might only attract around 30 per cent of the votes in a general election - but anything can happen in the next three and a half years			1
@entity10 and @entity0 loom the largest over their respective parties as the long road toward 2016 begins			2
after only just failing to secure the nomination in 2008 and achieving high approval ratings as @entity86 ’s top diplomat she has a strong claim in being the @entity9 front - runner			2
if @entity0 were to run , it might not be as straight forward as a @entity12 candidacy but his ties to @entity4 and @entity7 would make him a decent candidate for the @entity6			1
both @entity12 and @entity0 have number of backers on both sides who are ready to sign up			2
backers : both @entity12 and @entity0 would have guaranteed support in terms of activists , fundraisers and ground staff if they decided to run for office @entity6 strategist @entity104 said that @entity86 are loyal to political families like they are loyal to trusted brand names			1
' the political equivalent of a brand is the dynasty , the @entity110 or @entity12 's			2
and even if @entity111 produces @entity111 , or @entity112 , an @entity113 , now and then …			0
we know and value what the brand stands for … otherwise , we would n’t want it rehabilitated			0
even if @entity0 decides not to run , tt may not be the last the public have heard from the @entity0 's when it comes to public office ; president @entity0 's nephew @entity123 is running for @entity125			1
brother to brother : former president @entity26 ( left ) hugs his brother , former @entity4 governor @entity0 ( right ) - and presumably gives him a few words of advice on running for president brotherly love : @entity26 ( left ) hugs his brother @entity0 ( right ) could continue the @entity0 dynasty in @entity86 politics come 2016 during the interview , president @entity0 said he did not believe the @entity6 was ' doomed forever '			1
he said , ' the party ought to nominate somebody who can stand by principles and explain why conservative principles are better for the vast majority of the citizens			0
' president @entity0 has kept a low profile since leaving the @entity143 in 2009			2
he told the @entity144 that people are surprised to know he likes to paint			0
' of course , some people are surprised i can even read , ' he said .			0
