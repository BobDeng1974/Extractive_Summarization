from @entity1 's vampire facials - which draws her own blood before injecting it back into her face - to @entity6 's beloved sheep placenta facials , there 's some weird and wonderful beauty treatments on the market today			1
but one grandmother 's bizarre beauty secret has just gone and trumped them all			2
67 - year - old @entity12 from @entity13 says that her key to eternal youth is semen facials			1
bizarre : speaking in a @entity18 video , 67 - year - old @entity12 says that her key to eternal youth is semen facials - a tip she picked up on her travels in @entity23 ' it 's worth thousands and thousands , but it 's free , ' she explains in a @entity18 video			1
' all you need is a lover but if you do n't have one , you know what to do			0
all you need to do is , every ten days or two weeks , just both have a good time , make sure he has a good time , and when your beautiful love - making session is over , you are going to scoop this amazing sperm mask up in your fingers , put it on your face , leave it for fifteen minutes and wash it off			1
' she goes on : '' i know some of you are thinking " what is she saying ? ! " but we have to assume that your lover is a healthy clean man and eats wells			0
@entity49 , who describes herself as an author , life coach , couples counselor and tantric guide , explains that she learned the bizarre anti-ageing trick during her time in @entity23 , where she was studying a lovemaking method called @entity56			1
skincare secret : she advises people to ' scoop this amazing sperm mask up in your fingers , put it on your face , leave it for fifteen minutes and wash it off ' does it work ? @entity49 said a lady in @entity23 swore by the technique , which had been passed down her family too far ? @entity49 , an author and sex coach , describes a lover 's semen as ' the freshest cell therapy available on our planet ' writing on her website , she said : ' i came across one of the most beautiful women i 'd ever seen			1
she told me she was in her late sixties but looked much younger			0
her skin was so silky smooth and line free , i had to know her secret			0
' her secret was that she used a face mask made from her husband 's sperm ( apparently this beauty tip had been passed down through generations of her family and always been thought of as nothing			2
' @entity49 describes a lover 's semen as ' the freshest cell therapy available on our planet ' because , she claims , it is packed with recognised proteins and minerals that are known to reduce the ageing process			1
does she swear by it too ? in an on - camera interview with @entity92 , actress @entity93 , 51 , said she uses semen on her skin and @entity49 is n't the only fan of the quirky beauty trick			1
in an on - camera interview with @entity92 , actress @entity93 , 51 , was asked if she had any recommendations for anti-ageing skincare products			1
' you just put semen on your face , ' she replied			2
according to @entity105 magazine , human sperm is a powerful anti-oxidant that is said to diminish wrinkles and smooth the skin			2
the substance is now even sold by a @entity111 company called @entity112 and spermine facials are offered in @entity114			2
cosmetic dermatologist dr. @entity115 told @entity116 that there 's some truth in this bizarre beauty tip. ' @entity120 contains proteolytic enzymes , which are designed to break down proteins			0
in theory , if applied to the skin , these enzymes could help to break down the uneven and thickened dead layer of older , sun - damaged skin			0
this could make the skin feel smoother			0
' however , this might only be achieved with daily application for days or weeks			0
it would also not be practical as a “ mask , ” since it is a body fluid and will not remain stable outside the body			0
it would lose its beneficial effect , if any , very quickly after application			0
