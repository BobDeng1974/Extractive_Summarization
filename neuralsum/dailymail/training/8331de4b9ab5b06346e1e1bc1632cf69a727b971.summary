@entity11 , 74 , told @entity13 circuit judge @entity12 during a hearing in @entity15 , @entity16 on wednesday that he would comply with an order she issued last year			1
' i 'm gon na take @entity19 up and have her cremated and keep the remains in the house , ' he said			0
@entity11 had previously vowed to never remove the remains of his wife , @entity23 , after promising her before her death in april 2009 that he would bury her just yards from their front porch			1
devoted : @entity11 , left , has agreed to remove the body of his wife @entity28 , right , which is buried in their front yard in @entity31 , @entity16			1
the body will be exhumed on friday and will be cremated he maintained the city should n't be able to force him to remove the grave , which is marked with a headstone and decorated with plants and flowers , from his longtime residence in @entity31			1
but he has now conceded defeat and said he will hire a contractor to remove the body of his wife on friday and will then have it cremated			0
@entity11 said the exhumation and an urn would cost $ 2,745 , and the judge also ordered him to pay $ 678 for a legal transcript the city said it needed			2
the couple both grew up in @entity50 , @entity51 , and first met when she was seven and he was 11 and he asked her to accompany him to a strawberry festival			0
' we went on that one date , and it was me and her the rest of the time , ' he said			0
they were married for 48 years and had five children			0
in her later years , his wife suffered crippling arthritis , and mr. @entity11 retired from his job as an electrical worker to take care of her until her death in april 2009			2
remembered : in an image from august 2012 , @entity11 stands in front of his wife 's grave by their home memorial : he has been fighting to keep her body there - in accordance with her dying wishes - for 4 years shortly before her death , mr. @entity11 said , she expressed her wish to be buried in the yard of the house where they had spent three decades together			1
the @entity85 rejected @entity11 ' request for a cemetery permit for his yard after his wife died , but he buried her a few feet from the front porch anyway			1
the city sued to make @entity11 remove the grave , arguing that laws prohibit people from using their yards as burial grounds inside the city limits , and a judge last year ordered @entity11 to move the remains to a licensed cemetery			1
the @entity101 recently refused to intervene in the case , and @entity12 held the hearing to determine how the exhumation would occur and how the costs would be covered			0

missed : @entity11 , holding his wife 's picture , said there has been ' so much hurt ' from the court battle city attorney @entity123 said the town tried to work with @entity11 , offering him two plots in the town cemetery for @entity28 and himself , but the man refused to cooperate			1
' he said it was easier to ask for forgiveness than permission , and that 's what he did , ' @entity123 said			0
@entity11 ' attorney , @entity134 , and @entity123 agreed that the body , casket and burial vault would be removed and the grave refilled immediately , but @entity11 said he would not move the stone tombstone that has marked the grave			2
@entity123 said a city ordinance prohibits markers like the tombstone at homes , ' but that 's an issue for another day			0
' @entity11 said he had dropped a plan to declare his house a church so he could keep the grave as is .			0

@entity11 buried his wife @entity28 just yards from their front porch in @entity31 , @entity16 in 2009 in accordance with her dying wishes
he buried her there even though the city had refused a permit
the city sued him and argues that laws prohibit people from using their yards as burial grounds inside the city limits
last year a judge *ruled* in the city 's *favor* and this week @entity28 's body will be exhumed and cremated
