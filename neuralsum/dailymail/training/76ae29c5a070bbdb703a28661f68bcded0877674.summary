@entity0 was honest to the point of bluntness			1
after a full @entity6 debut he instantly wanted to forget , the @entity4 striker is simply left hoping he gets another chance to prove his worth			1
@entity0 had made four previous substitute appearances in dark blue before an ankle injury to @entity12 opened the way for him to start against @entity14 on tuesday night			1
the stage was set at @entity16 — the ground his father @entity18 used to visit as a fan — for the 26 - year - old to properly announce his arrival			1
ultimately , though , his individual display was emblematic of the collective ease with which @entity26 ’s side were swept aside in a 3 - 1 defeat			1
@entity0 admitted he and @entity6 struggled against @entity14 during tuesday night 's 3 - 1 defeat @entity0 was utterly dominated by @entity29 and @entity30 , lasting just 45 minutes before @entity26 withdrew him at half - time			1
his big night was n’t supposed to be like this			2
lamenting the loss of his club form when it truly mattered , the @entity34 - born forward knows he has to radically improve to threaten @entity12 ’s spot at the apex of the national side			1
‘ it was a tough 45 minutes , both individually and as a team , ’ admitted @entity0			1
‘ we struggled a little bit			2
‘ personally , i did n’t get hold of the ball and it is important that i learn from it			2
it was my first taste of starting at this sort of level against a very good side in @entity14 with some very good players			1
‘ i have to review it and see where i went wrong			2
that is all i can do			2
i am disappointed with myself			2
that is one of the worst games i have played for a long time			1
‘ i think i am better than that			2
i do n’t want to be remembered for that game and i hope i get another chance to prove i am better than that and i will have to bide my time and wait and see			1
’ @entity0 keeps his eyes on the ball and manages to hold off the challenge of @entity14 defender @entity29 a four - month shutdown for @entity6 means @entity0 will have to wait until at least march , when @entity66 visit on @entity68 business			1
starring for @entity4 in the interim is all he can do			2
‘ most players are probably their own biggest critics because that is how you improve as a person and player , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ everyone has to do that			2
this was a big game for me against players performing week in , week out in the @entity81 and that is a big step - up from what i am used to in the @entity84 with @entity4			1
it is a great learning curve for me			2
’ @entity26 ’s decision to substitute @entity0 delivered a public verdict on his performance , but the former @entity90 man admitted he had no complaints			1
‘ the manager wanted to win the game and felt he needed to change the team , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’m not going to take any offence to being taken off			0
he trusted me to start me but i obviously did n’t do enough to stay on the pitch			1
that ’ s quite simple			0
‘ the manager wanted to change it to try to get back into the game			0
‘ i ’m not sure if i ’ll speak to the manager in the months ahead			0
what i have to do is knuckle down and play well for @entity4 so i can get called up again			0
‘ overall , the better team won			0
@entity14 played better than us and created more chances			1
we did n’t play as well as we have done , which is disappointing because it would have been nice to see how we matched up to them			0
’ @entity0 , pictured against @entity30 , admits he needs to knuckle down for @entity4 over the coming months the ease with which @entity14 sampled success on their first trip north in 15 years provided a comedown after the ecstasy of friday night ’s 1 - 0 @entity68 qualifier victory over the @entity117			1
‘ you have to have the feeling that we won the game that mattered most , ’ admitted @entity0			1
‘ that ’s not just because we lost this one and everyone wants to look back			1
‘ we won the big game against @entity126 , where we picked up three points			0
but do n’t get me wrong , we are all very disappointed with the performance tonight			0
we want to be better than that			0
’ those feelings were echoed by captain @entity131 , who insisted @entity6 could not use the immense effort invested against the @entity133 as mitigation for last night ’s display			1
‘ we got a good few days recovery in , ’ said @entity131			0
‘ that was no excuse			0
‘ we just did n’t do enough on the ball or create chances			0
we did n’t put @entity14 under pressure			1
i feel like we let ourselves down			0
‘ we know we are a lot better than that and can play better			0
we know we have much more to offer			0
@entity0 expertly brings the ball down but only lasted until half - time before being replaced by @entity147 ‘ we are aware we have let ourselves and the fans down			1
more than 100,000 have turned up in these two games and it was another great atmosphere			0
‘ the biggest problem is we know we can compete			0
we showed it at @entity153 last year			0
it was n’t a case of us underestimating @entity14			1
‘ they are a great side			1
they have a squad full of world - class players , playing in the @entity158 every week			2
but so do we , so there are no excuses			0
’ once that anguish fades , @entity131 admitted he would happily accept a 2015 that displayed the same progress as the current year			0
‘ it ’s been a great year but next year is even more important , ’ he added			0
‘ we have got to try to maintain this level in 2015 and keep trying to get the wins to stay up the table			0
‘ it ’s not a case of it being a reality check			0
we have really kicked on			0
‘ there is always going to be a stumble here or there and , thankfully , it came in a friendly match			0
