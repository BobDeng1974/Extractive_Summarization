@entity1 users of @entity2 and other instant messaging services that were popular before @entity4 and @entity5 will remember the ‘ away ’ message			1
and years after it was popular , @entity4 is bringing back short updates in a new form – the ‘ sidebar status ’			1
the feature lets users post a short message about what they are doing in a sidebar added to the social network ’s mobile app , complete with an illustrative picture , but it 's currently only available to selected people for testing			1
@entity4 's @entity21 status feature ( pictured ) will let users post a short message about what they are doing in a sidebar added to the social network ’s mobile app , complete with an illustrative picture the sidebar can be accessed by swiping right on the screen and brings up a user ’s most messaged friends			1
a @entity4 spokesman told @entity32 : ‘ millions of people already use the sidebar to quickly find and contact their friends			1
‘ we 're testing new features in this space that let you and your friends stay up to date on all the things that make up your day			0
’ the sidebar can be accessed by swiping right on the screen ( news feed pictured left ) and brings up a user ’s most messaged friends			0
here , they can see short updates such as ' making blueberry scones at home ' and ' watching the game at home ' ( right ) @entity4 has started collecting information about the other websites users visit , the links they click on and their searches			2
the social media site already harvests details people share on their profiles , including where they went to school , their interests and where they live			0
but under a new privacy policy – to which anyone who has signed into @entity4 since february has been opted in automatically – it can track activity outside the website , including online searches and some of the details users share with retailers			2
a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ it takes into account pages and places visited on @entity4 , alongside browsing on the internet			0
’ she added that the changes help @entity4 ' to better serve more relevant advertising to you			0
' the site uses cookies – small files which it places on your web browser or device – to collect information which can then be transmitted back to @entity4			0
the new terms were introduced as part of a wider update to @entity4 's privacy policy , which - the social network claimed - was designed to make the rules easier to understand			2
@entity4 is testing the service in @entity95 and @entity96 , where from today , users of the app will see short status messages under their friends ’ names , @entity93 reported			1
users can choose from an array of small pictures , such as a bicycle or coffee cup , for example , to go with their status			2
as well as the addition of the images , the sidebar updates differ from a regular status updates because they do n’t show up in the main @entity114			0
they can just be seen in the sidebar and expire after 12 hours – allowing only the person who posted them to access them again			1
while the updates are visible to friends , users can change the privacy settings to determine who sees an update			0
the comparison of the old ‘ away ’ messages has been drawn because of the small square images and the fact they will be sent to only close friends , despite the fact that we are rarely away from phones and computers now - a - days			1
for many people , @entity4 ’s main @entity114 hosts information from a large number of contacts and brands as well as friends , and the social network has heard from its users that people want a place to see and share smaller updates too			1
the idea is that the sidebar is a quick way to keep friends in the loop of what a user is doing and vice versa			0
users can choose from an array of small pictures , such as a bicycle or coffee cup , for example , to go with their status ( pictured left ) and add a location tag ( pictured right )			0
