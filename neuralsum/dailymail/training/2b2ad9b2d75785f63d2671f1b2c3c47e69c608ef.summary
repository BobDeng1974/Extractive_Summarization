by @entity0 @entity1 has been ordered to pay £ 750,000 after millions of customers were hit with an extra fee of £ 180 a year because they paid their bills by cash or cheque			1
the high charges were part of a drive to persuade customers to pay automatically by direct debit			0
customers who opt not to pay by direct debit can be charged a fee to cover the extra expense of processing cheques and cash , but it must not exceed the actual administration cost			0
energy watchdog @entity16 said @entity1 's fees were unfair and amounted to overcharging of £ 100 a year per bill			1
the £ 180 fee is thought to have hit @entity1 's elderly customers particularly hard , because they are more likely to want to pay by cash or cheque but the regulator has not told the firm to refund the money			1
instead it must pay the £ 750,000 to the @entity27 scheme , run by citizens advice , which helps people cut their bills and shop around for the best tariff			1
the £ 180 fee is thought to have hit @entity1 's elderly customers particularly hard , because they are more likely to want to pay by cash or cheque			1
it overcharged cheque customers between september 2009 and december 2012 , forcing them to pay over the odds at the height of the financial crisis			2
but @entity16 said the practice had not ' harmed ' customers			0
while @entity43 - owned @entity1 was billing an extra £ 180 a year , the rest of the industry was charging around £ 80			1
@entity16 began investigating the payments in december 2012 , at which point @entity1 cut the fee by almost half to £ 97 and subsequently to £ 95			1
@entity47 , chief executive of @entity28 , said : ' energy firms are taking advantage of customers when they overcharge for different payment methods			2
@entity16 began investigating the payments in december 2012 , at which point @entity1 cut the fee by almost half to £ 97 and subsequently to £ 95 ' with fuel bills up a third since 2010 , costs are already very high , so people should n't be paying more than they have to in order to have a warm home and the lights on			1
' with trust in energy suppliers at rock bottom , companies need to be up - front and clear about why prices between alternative payment methods differ and by how much			2
' @entity16 is right to hold @entity1 to account for not sticking to the rules and it is good that struggling consumers will benefit as a result of its action			2
' it has taken four years for this issue to be resolved so we hope this action is a sign that @entity16 is getting on with current enforcement cases and can find a quicker way to sort these issues out for consumers			0
' @entity80 , @entity16 's senior partner in charge of enforcement , said : ' suppliers need to clearly justify the different prices they set for different payment methods			0
' @entity1 did not have a robust process in place when setting their prices to ensure that the difference between their tariffs complied with @entity16 's rules			1
we 've held them to account for this			0
' a @entity1 spokesman said : ' @entity1 has co-operated fully with this investigation			2
we recognise that we did not have a robust process in place but we are pleased that @entity16 has concluded its investigation and made no finding that any specific impact on customers resulted			0
' the firm was ordered to pay £ 8.5million last year after @entity16 found its sales staff had talked people into switching suppliers by making false claims			1
just last week , @entity108 - owned energy firm @entity107 was fined a record £ 12million for mis - selling by sales staff on the doorstep and over the phone			1
compensation to customers could add up to another £ 8million			2
energy tariff prices are in a constant merry - go - round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other			1
shrewd consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on the cheapest deal			0
even moving every other year will save you significant amounts			0
suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you 're ready to switch , it will certainly pay to do so			0
if you are one of the millions of people who have never switched ( i.e. stuck with your original supplier ) , then you will definitely save a big chunk of cash , possibly as much as £ 300 a year			0
prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live			0
you only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live , so do your own comparison to find the best price .			0
