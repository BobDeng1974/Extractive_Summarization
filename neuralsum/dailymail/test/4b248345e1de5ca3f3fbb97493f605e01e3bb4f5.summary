belly flop to belly up ? it ’s fair to say @entity2 has had better weeks than this one , which featured the publication of some poolside diving snaps and culminated in a defeat that suggests @entity7 might yet bomb out of the @entity8			1
this was a game they could not afford to lose			0
not when their final seven games include fixtures against @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			0
but lose they did , bringing their winless run to five and leaving themselves in a right mess			0
@entity24 roars with celebration after giving @entity26 a 2 - 0 lead against @entity7 at the @entity28 on saturday @entity24 unleashed a thunderous overhead kick shortly before half - time to capitalise on some poor @entity7 defending the @entity32 striker fires a spectacular volley past @entity34 and into the roof of the @entity7 net to double the home side 's lead the @entity26 striker celebrates his strike in front of a group of young supporters after doubling his side 's lead in the first half @entity26 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity47 6.5 ; @entity48 6 ( @entity49 56 , 6 ) , @entity50 6.5 , @entity51 7 , @entity52 7 ; ki 7 , @entity53 6.5 ( @entity54 65 , 6 ) , @entity55 6.5 ( @entity56 90 ) ; @entity57 6.5 , @entity24 7.5 , @entity58 6.5 subs not used : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 booked : @entity51 scorer ( s ) : ki 18 , @entity24 37 , 90 +1 @entity7 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity34 5.5 ; @entity65 5.5 , @entity66 ( @entity67 70 , 6 ) , @entity68 6.5 ; @entity69 6 , @entity70 5.5 ( @entity71 30 , 6 ) , @entity72 6 , @entity73 5 , @entity74 6 ; @entity75 5 , @entity76 4.5 ( @entity77 81 ) subs not used : @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 booked : @entity76 , @entity68 , @entity83 , @entity2 , @entity67 sent off : @entity73 53 scorer ( s ) : @entity68 50 referee : @entity86 man of the match : @entity24 @entity24 scored a spectacular overhead			1
click here for more match zone true , they could have benefited more from refereeing decisions – @entity24 was offside in the build up to his brilliant first goal and @entity73 ’s second - half red card could have gone either way – but that should not exonerate a side that is supposed to be fighting for it life and yet looked so meek for half of this match			1
they managed no shots on goal in the time it took @entity26 to go 2 - 0 ahead through @entity108 and @entity24 ’s bicycle kick			1
and it was only in the second half that they mounted a challenge			2
as fate would have it , @entity73 was sent off for fouling @entity48 two minutes after @entity68 had given @entity7 a lifeline			1
@entity24 finished them in stoppage time			1
he said : ‘ we were disappointed to lose the game and we knew we were nowhere near good enough in the first - half in particular			1
‘ but the two big decisions went against us and they could have turned the game			2
@entity24 ’ first goal is a fantastic piece of skill but he is five yards offside			1
@entity24 grabbed his second of the match after racing on to @entity55 's pass and chipping @entity34 in injury time the 29 - year - old celebrates in front of the @entity26 fans on his hands and knees after making sure of the three points @entity68 pulled a goal back for @entity7 five minutes into the second half when he pounced in the six - yard box the @entity7 defender slotted past @entity47 from just four yard out after latching onto a free kick totally unmarked ‘ we had got back into the game at 2 - 1 but unfortunately @entity73 has picked up a red card			1
i ’ve seen it six times now and from three angles and to me it ’s a perfectly decent challenge			0
‘ the other three i look at it and he takes part of the ball and the leg collides with the boy			0
we may as well say with these grey areas that you are not allowed to tackle if you tackle on the floor			0
’ the consequence of the challenge , beyond damage to @entity7 ’s survival prospects , is that @entity48 went to hospital for an x-ray on his ankle			1
@entity164 said : ‘ his ankle is really swollen			0
that is the real negative			0
we hope it is not serious			0
at the time i thought it was a genuine 50 - 50 challenge			2
my initial reaction was “ bad challenge ” but i do n’t think there was any malice			0
you run that risk if your foot is high and goes over the ball			0
’ for @entity175 , it was the only complaint from a match that @entity26 probably could have won in third gear			1
that ’s no exaggeration in the context of how poor @entity7 were in the opening 45 minutes			1
for a team in that kind of mess , with those fixtures still to come , it was incomprehensible			0
that ’s not to say @entity26 stormed from the blocks			2
@entity108 ’s opener after 18 minutes was actually the first chance of the game			1
@entity55 had taken his usual punt from distance and while @entity34 did well to get down and save , his parry fell squarely at the feet of the @entity195			2
@entity73 was sent off for the visitors just three minutes after @entity68 pulled a goal back for a lunge on @entity48 @entity7 midfielder @entity73 and his team - mates look on in disbelief as @entity86 reaches for the red card @entity26 right back @entity48 limps from the field and has to be replaced by @entity49 following @entity73 's tackle @entity108 buried the finish without taking a touch and now has scored four goals in eight games			1
with seven this season , the deep - lying midfielder has become a delightfully complete player			2
it took 24 minutes for @entity7 to have their first chance – @entity76 hit a bouncing ball from 30 yards and it trickled all the way to @entity47			1
it was n’t even on target			0
the rest of their attacks fizzled , a side with five across the middle seemingly incapable of holding possession			0
@entity24 nailed the second with a goal that was hardly at home in such a subdued game			1
it really was a beautiful finish			0
@entity48 delivered a ball into the area , @entity65 attempted to head clear and the striker buried a bicycle kick			2
replays showed he had come back from an offside position , but the finish was magnificent			0
at that stage , @entity7 appeared out of it			2
@entity164 warned his side of complacency at the break and , in his words , ‘ they did the total opposite ’			0
it enabled @entity7 to pull one back after 49 minutes			1
@entity51 had tangled with @entity241 and conceded a free - kick which @entity74 delivered from the right			0
@entity244 found space from six yards to flick a header at goal and @entity68 poked a finish past @entity47			1
for two minutes @entity7 looked a genuine threat			1
and then , just as quickly , hope was gone			0
@entity73 went high on @entity48 and will miss the next three games			2
@entity108 opened the scoring for the home side inside 20 minutes after pouncing following an @entity34 save @entity108 leads the celebrations after giving @entity164 's side an early advantage at the @entity28 on saturday @entity7 , to their credit , did not give up			1
but it was in their desperation for a leveller that they conceded a third			0
@entity54 dispossessed @entity74 and @entity57 sent a long ball to @entity24			2
with none of @entity7 ’s outfield players in their own half , the @entity32 had time to think before a nice chip over @entity34			1
in this strange old season of moans and a feint , he has also made his way to eight goals in all competitions			0
it will be interesting to see if his improved recent form has soothed some of the anger caused by his january agitations			0
it will be more interesting in the shorter term to see if @entity7 can find the significant improvement needed to get themselves out of this hole .			2
