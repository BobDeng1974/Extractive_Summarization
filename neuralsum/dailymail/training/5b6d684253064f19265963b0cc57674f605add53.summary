but the boiling water burned mr @entity4 ’s buttocks and flank leaving him needing hospital treatment			2
@entity4 , 44 , suffered from chronic back pain and when medication failed to work - he tried hot baths in an attempt to ease the pain			1
however , one scalded his buttocks and he was taken to @entity16 , pictured , where he later died from his injuries he was admitted to @entity16 last month - but sadly the burns turned septic and he was declared dead just days later			1

' we know from the family it was something he had been doing			0
' it is very sad he was having baths so hot they have led to burns and led to sepsis			0

' hot baths are recognised as treatment for short - term back pain on the @entity56 website alongside hot water bottles , ice packs , painkillers and changing your sleeping position			1
but bathers are warned to always check the temperature of the water before climbing into the tub due to the dangers of scalding water - particularly for young children and the elderly			2
