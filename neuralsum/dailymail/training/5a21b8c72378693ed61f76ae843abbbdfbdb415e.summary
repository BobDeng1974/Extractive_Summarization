these pictures show @entity2 's latest weapon against the growing menace of rogue drones buzzing through their nation 's skies : another drone , with a net			1
in a demonstration flight in @entity11 , east of @entity12 , the mesh - wielding flying machine was shown snaring a dji phantom 2 drone - the same brand as one which crashed onto the @entity18 lawn last month			2
the @entity19 was sent scrambling by the unexpected intrusion , but @entity2 has already faced dozens of drone overflights over sensitive sites			1
mystery drones have buzzed nuclear plants , military installations and even the presidential palace in recent months , as fears run high of terrorist attacks linked to the @entity31 's @entity30 insurgency			0
books closed on bids for the drone interception system last week , but so far it seems those lofty goals have not been realised			2
indeed , the maker of the six - bladed drone with the net demonstrated yesterday for an @entity74 photographer has not even bothered to put itself forward			1
' this is a technology phenomenon , not an aeronautical phenomenon ' , @entity76 , head of drone maker @entity77 , told the @entity74 , adding ' within 18 months , whatever they come up with will be obsolete already			0
' gotcha ! @entity77 pilot @entity80 brings his drone @entity81 back to earth after it snared the @entity85 drone			0
@entity36 , a small drone - focused start - up , has not bid for the government work ' this is a technology phenomenon , not an aeronautical phenomenon ' : @entity76 , head of @entity36 , who said , ' within 18 months , whatever they come up [ to counter drones ] with will be obsolete already ' civilian drones have become a 21st - century hobby for many , from high - tech aficionados to curious kids , and a hot seller			0
companies like @entity99 even want to use drones for deliveries			0
but their increasing presence in the skies gives headaches to national security chiefs			0
for months , @entity2 has faced dozens of drone overflights over sensitive sites â€” mostly nuclear facilities , a worrisome development in a country that gets the highest percentage of its energy in the world from atomic power			1
@entity2 authorities say the drones currently present no threat			1
but some fear the drones could be spying on @entity2 technology or could one day be equipped with bombs or other weapons			1
authorities have stepped up security at @entity2 nuclear sites and are investigating who might be behind the drone flights			1
the possible risks of rogue drones include terrorism , the invasion of privacy , the theft of industry secrets , and ' damage to the credibility of public authorities , institutions or companies , ' said @entity2 's @entity139			2
the drone which crashed on the @entity141 last month : its pilot contacted the @entity19 the next day and said he had not intended for it to go near the @entity18 and that he had been flying it for fun a @entity2 security official said @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity2 and the @entity150 were among the countries confronting the drone issue			1
he spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak publicly on the matter			0
state media in @entity157 say @entity157 scientists have already developed a laser weapon that can detect and shoot down small , low - flying and slow - moving aircraft inside a 1.2 - mile radius			0
other anti-drone devices could include pinpoint radar systems to track drones the size of a breadbasket or even smaller ( and distinguish them from birds ) ; high - tech lasers to destroy the unwanted intruders or telecommunications - scrambling systems to block the remote controls that direct them			2
interception drones , like the one made by @entity77 , could be sent up into the sky to fight back and low - tech solutions such as sky - high netting or fences could also work , officials say			2
' in other words , everything is possible , ' said mr @entity76 .			0

@entity184 drops a net to ensnare aerial intruders
@entity2 officials also ask scientists to devise more *sophisticated* solutions
they want to scramble their control *mechanisms* and destroy them *safely*
@entity2 has faced dozens of drone overflights over sensitive sites
