lanes of impatient drivers and pot - hole ridden pavements can make cycling in the city seem like a battle for survival			2
but now , an innovative helmet that reads a rider 's brain waves is hoping to change that by mapping cyclists ' stress levels			1
dubbed @entity15 , the helmet uses the data it collects to create real - time maps of the best routes for stress - free city cycling			1
zoom in on the interactive map below to find out the most relaxing cycle routes in @entity22 the helmet is being developed by @entity26 - based start - up @entity24 , who have been testing it on the streets of @entity22			1
during september and october , eight riders wore the helmets while travelling @entity32 using the north - south thoroughfares			0
as the wearer rode down city streets , the mind reading helmet tracked their brainwaves to measure their stress levels before plotting them on a map			1
a riders ' level of attention – which indicated stress - was ranked from 0 to 100 , then linked onto a colour scale , from green to yellow to red			1
the ' @entity49 ' helmet has a forehead - based sensor that uses @entity52 to measure the cyclist 's brain waves			1
this data is then placed on to a real - time map , revealing the biker 's stress levels on different city streets			1
pictured are maps of @entity32 created using the system during september and october , eight riders wore the helmets ( right ) while travelling @entity32 ( left ) using the north - south thoroughfares			0
the ride is shown on the map using a colour scale , with green suggesting a relaxing ride and red revealing stress the helmet has a soft forehead - based sensor that uses @entity52 – or electroencephalography – to measure the rider 's brain @entity74 also has an ear - based sensor that 's used to remove noise from the @entity52 signal			1
the current design is also bluetooth compatible allowing the data from the @entity52 sensor to be fed to an app on the user 's smartphone which uses the phone 's gps after a few rides , the cyclists could analyse the data they had generated to plan the best route			1
a separate crowd sourced map was also created , which gathered data to help other cyclists or city planner plan the best bike routes in their area			2
its creators hope , eventually , anyone with the helmet can share their data anonymously , and this information will be included in a real - time map online			1
developed by a designer during a visit to @entity109 , the helmet looks slightly different to an ordinary bike helmet			0
' the bumps are inspired by the branching neurons and shape of the brain itself , ' @entity111 , who created the helmet told @entity117			2
' they are stylistic , but as we move toward a final design , we may use them to help secure the circuit in place			0
' the new version of the helmet has a light that tells the cyclist if their anxious by glowing in area visible from the corner of their eye			0
pictured is a map generated by the system which shows the ' hotspots ' and ' sweet spots ' in @entity22 a riders ' level of attention – which indicated stress - was ranked from 0 to 100 , then linked onto a colour scale , from green to yellow to red the helmet has a soft forehead - based sensor that uses @entity52 – or electroencephalography – to measure the rider 's brain waves			1
it also has an ear - based sensor that 's used to remove noise from the @entity52 signal			1
an early prototype included red and green lights to warn drivers if a cyclist was particularly stressed			2
that design has now been scrapped and the new version has a light that tells the cyclist if their anxious by glowing in area visible from the corner of their eye			0
this can help the cyclists know when to be more cautious , and lower their stress levels by moving away from a particularly busy street			2
the current design is also bluetooth compatible allowing the data from the @entity52 sensor to be fed to an app on the user 's smartphone which uses the phone 's gps			1
the team is currently mapping local neighbourhoods in @entity26 , @entity22 , block - by - block			0
' we think the map could still be useful to compare against traffic and accident data , and will be a cool visual proof - of - concept , ' said ms @entity111			2
the @entity187 contains flashing leds on the sleeves which are activated when a cyclist raises their arm from smart helmets to traffic detection systems , inventors are working to make cycling safer			0
now there 's a light - up jacket with built in indicators to make a biker 's intentions clearer to motorists			2
the @entity187 contains flashing leds on the sleeves which are activated when a cyclist raises their arm - so that other road users can clearly see when they 're making a turn			0
the smart jacket also contains a built - in light on the back to help boost riders ' visibility			0
it runs off a handy usb - charged battery pack and comes in two colours – black and neon yellow			0
the jacket will go on sale later this month at @entity219 , for £ 99 ( $ 150 )			0
' our customers told us that better safety products would encourage them to cycle more , and the illuminating @entity187 will make it easier for commuters to be seen on the roads , ' said @entity219 product manager @entity220 said			0
' we know visibility can be a major barrier to cycling at this time of year - we want to help commuters to overcome these barriers and to encourage as many people as possible to cycle			0
