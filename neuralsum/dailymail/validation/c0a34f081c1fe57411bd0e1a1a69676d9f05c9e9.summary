@entity0 have been linked with summer moves for both @entity2 and @entity3			1
but who would you buy if you could only pick one ? we asked our experts ... @entity2 and @entity3 have both been linked with a move to @entity0 @entity9 - @entity3 @entity2 is a better long - term investment but if you ’re talking about a transfer this summer that would make an immediate impact , then it has to be @entity3			1
@entity0 have gone from dominating at the top to fighting for fourth			2
signing @entity3 would bring @entity0 instant success and put them back on the map			1
he understands the club and would appreciate the enormity of the task , but he more than anyone else would breathe new life into the fans			0
what a statement that would be			0
@entity3 enjoyed six successful years under sir @entity28 at @entity29 @entity30 - @entity3 this feels like a trick question			1
@entity3 and @entity33 are two of the greatest players we have ever had the privilege to watch			0
@entity3 has done it all before at @entity0 - and we would love to see him do it all over again			1
@entity3 trains ahead of @entity39 against @entity40 in @entity41 on sunday night @entity42 - @entity3 there ’s no real debate			0
no disrespect to @entity2 , but the all - round game of @entity3 , from his range of skill , shooting , free - kicks , finishing , heading is just better			2
that does n’t make @entity2 a bad player - just not as good			0
in financial terms you could make a case for @entity2 being five years younger but i ’m pretty sure you could rely on four good years out of @entity3			2
@entity3 celebrates after scoring in the @entity57 tie against @entity58 earlier this month @entity59 - @entity2 it is purely an age thing			2
@entity3 is unlikely to be as good in the next three years as he has been in the last three years and as his body language showed last weekend , you would n’t want him around if he feared he was in decline			0
@entity2 ’s game is tailor - made for the @entity66 and if his pace was added to the current @entity0 technicians they would be champions @entity2 trains at the @entity71 training ground before heading to @entity40 for the crunch clash @entity73 - @entity2 no doubting @entity3 is the better player but @entity2 has age on his side and is not so unbelievably selfish as a person that he would pout if a team - mate scores			1
@entity80 - @entity2 @entity2 , no question			0
the former @entity83 man is only going to get better			0
@entity2 would make a sensational return to the @entity66 if he joins @entity0			1

@entity0 have been linked with a move for @entity2
they would also be *interested* in *re-signing* @entity3
but the @entity29 club could only realistically finance one deal
we asked our *reporters* who they would sign for @entity0
