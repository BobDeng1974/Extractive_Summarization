horse - drawn carriage drivers are preparing for a fight after @entity3 's mayor - elect @entity2 said he wanted to outlaw the iconic rides when he takes office tomorrow			1
mr @entity2 used his mayoral campaign to protest against the rides , saying it was not humane to have horses vying for space with traffic on the city 's congested roads			1

end of an era : carriage rides through @entity22 could be a thing of the past once @entity2 takes office at a press conference on monday mr @entity2 said ending the practice of horse - drawn rides , a $ 15 million a year industry in @entity3 , was a priority			1
' we are going to quickly and aggressively move to make horse carriages no longer a part of the landscape , ' he said			0
' they are not humane , they are not appropriate for the year 2014			2
' many of the 200 or so people who make a living out of the carriage - ride industry have threatened to take legal action against mr @entity2 and the city			1
' you can not just get rid of a business , a perfectly legal well - regulated … just because a few people do n't like it , ' @entity44 , a driver and spokeswomen for the industry , told the @entity51			2
' if he wants to ban them because they 're dangerous and inhumane , he needs to prove that			0
' @entity56 , of @entity57 , said the rides were part of @entity3 history and had been going since the park opened more than 100 years ago			0

animal activists however pointed out that everyone in the city traveled by horse - drawn carriage when @entity22 was first opened			2
it was n't until the 1940s that a @entity3 mayor first issued permits for carriage rides as part of the tourist industry , according to the blog @entity90			2
rights groups have also argued that the horses lead a dangerous life , vying for space on the city 's congested roads with traffic , and being confined to small stalls at night			1
at least three horses have died in road accidents in the past seven years			2
although the owners are required to give the horses five - week vacations out to pasture , many argue that is n't enough to protect their health			0
tourists appeared divided by the prospect of a ban			0
some , such as @entity111 and @entity112 said they had booked their ride before leaving @entity115 on vacation			0
but others on sites such as @entity119 welcomed the ban and expressed concern for the future of the horses and their drivers			1

the city council will have to approve any ban before it can take affect .			0
