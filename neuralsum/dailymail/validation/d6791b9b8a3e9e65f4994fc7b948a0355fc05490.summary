banks have experimented with card readers and even fingerprint scanners but in the near future you could access your accounts using your heartbeat			1
@entity7 has recently completed a successful trial of ' cardiac authentication ' for its online accounts using the @entity12 band			1
@entity13 reads the wearer 's heart rhythms , which is said to be as unique as a person 's fingerprint , to authenticate who they are			1
@entity7 ( branch pictured ) recently completed a successful trial of ' cardiac authentication ' for its online accounts using the @entity12 band			1
@entity13 reads the wearer 's heart rhythms , which is said to be as unique as a person 's fingerprint , to authenticate who they are a built - in proximity sensor can then detect where they are , and when the wearer is close to a paired device , will automatically confirm their identity and unlock the account			1
in particular , the bracelet contains a @entity36 sensor that measures the amount of electrical power generated by a human heart , called a cardiac rhythm tracked on an electrocardiogram , or @entity42			1
this @entity42 differs from person to person and depends on the location and size of the their heart			1
@entity13 only works with a registered person 's cardiac rhythm , meaning if the bracelet is stolen it ca n't be hacked			1
the technology was developed by @entity54 - based @entity53			0

the bracelet contains a @entity36 sensor that measures electrical power generated by a human heart tracked on an electrocardiogram , or @entity42 when the wearer clasps the @entity12 around their wrist , the bracelet powers on			1
by placing a finger on the topside sensor while the wrist is in contact with the bottom sensor , it completes an electrical circuit			0

by placing a finger on the topside sensor while the wrist is in contact with the bottom sensor , it completes an electrical circuit			0
@entity13 will then vibrate and built - in leds light up to tell the wearer the device has successfully authenticated them			2
users will stay authenticated until they remove their @entity13 and the electrical circuit is broke			2
the @entity12 functions on a three - factor security system - the bracelet , a unique heartbeat and an @entity90 ( @entity90 ) , which is a device registered with the app. @entity13 vibrates and built - in leds light up to tell the wearer the device has successfully authenticated them			1
users stay authenticated until they remove their @entity13 and the electrical circuit is broke			2
the @entity12 functions on a three - factor security system - the bracelet , a unique heartbeat and an @entity90 ( @entity90 ) , which is a smartphone or device registered with the app. when the @entity12 authenticates a user it looks at the shape of their @entity42 wave , not their heart rate			1
it can therefore adjust to typical variations in heart rate , even if the wearer has an irregular @entity42 as a result of a medical condition			2
the product 's site said : ' @entity12 offers security without compromising convenience , putting you , and only you , in control of your identity			2
' as you head out the door , you ’ll be able to interact with the world around you through the power of simple gestures			0
' with accurate and convenient authentication technology there is no end to the possibilities			0
' the @entity12 can replace everything from the pin on your credit card to the account information on your gaming console without sacrificing security , privacy or convenience			2
' in the first - of - its - kind trials by a @entity141 bank , @entity7 asked customers to use the wristband to login to their online accounts			0
when connected to an account , the band could also be used to pay for goods using contactless readers too			0
@entity149 , @entity7 's director of innovation and digital development , said : ' exploring innovative technology is a real focus for us at the bank			2
in the first - of - its - kind trials by a @entity141 bank , @entity7 asked staff and customers to use the wristband to login to their online accounts			0
when connected to an account , the band could , in theory , be used to pay for goods using contactless readers too ( example shown ) an @entity42 differs from person to person and depends on the location and size of the their heart			1
@entity13 only works with a registered person 's cardiac rhythm , meaning if the bracelet is stolen it ca n't be hacked			1
the technology ( pictured ) was developed by @entity54 - based @entity53 the bank said the band ( illustrated ) only works when worn by the account owner and it must be paired with the device being used ' we are in the very early stages of exploring potential uses for the @entity184 and wearable technology more widely			0
' the bank - owned by @entity187 - said the technology only works when worn by the account owner and the band has to be paired with the device being used to access the account			0
@entity187 recently updated its online banking app with a similar feature that pairs and recognises the phone or tablet it is being used on			0
this removes the need to enter the username , password and memorable information every time			0
instead the app just asks for the latter			0
the @entity12 bracelet can be pre-ordered for $ 79 ( £ 50 )			2
devices were due to ship in december but the site has not updated when it will go on general sale .			0

@entity7 has completed a successful trial of the tech using the @entity12 band
it reads the wearer 's cardiac rhythm , which is said to be as unique as a person 's fingerprint , to authenticate who they are
@entity13 measures the amount of electrical power generated by a human heart
this is called a cardiac rhythm and is tracked on electrocardiogram ( @entity42 )
@entity42 differs from person to person and depends on size of their heart
and because it only works with a registered person 's cardiac rhythm it ca n't be hacked if the bracelet is stolen
*makers* @entity241 said it is more secure than iris and fingerprint scanners
