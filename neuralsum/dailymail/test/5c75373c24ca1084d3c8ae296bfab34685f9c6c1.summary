dear lord hall , my jeans are too tight , my hairstyle is an exercise in holding back the years , my friends are all incredibly right - wing and i ’ve got hog - whimperingly drunk in the presence of @entity8 on more than one occasion			1
but none of these are the reasons why i want you to give me @entity15 ’s job			1
i know many men may baulk at the suggestion that a woman can take @entity15 ’s place			1
just look at what happened to @entity23 this week , who received a barrage of abuse on @entity27 when her name was mentioned for the role , along the lines of : ‘ men do cars , women do cake			1
’ but i think i ’m perfect for the job , and my principal qualification is entirely basic			1
why ? because women love cars just as much men ! i like the big ones with leather seats and walnut dashboards			1
i like the mad ones with three types of suspension			1
i like the small , nippy ones with exciting turning circles			1
i like the old - fashioned ones with manual chokes			1
i even like those weird @entity56 ones with the hydraulic suspension that feel and handle like ocean - liners			1
all the most memorable moments in my life feature the internal combustion engine			1
as a baby , the only way my parents could get me to go to sleep was to drive me round the block in their @entity67			1
once i ’d nodded off , they ’d reward themselves with a pint and a packet of crisps , leaving me happily slumbering in the pub car park			1
those were more laissez - faire times			1
when i was four , we emigrated to @entity76 and the @entity67 was sold			1
i clung on to the bumper for dear life , as though they had come to take away my favourite teddy			2
in the end it was all right , though , because it was soon replaced by a far more exciting prospect : an orange @entity84 — an @entity85 for poor people — in which we would whizz around @entity87 at breakneck speed			2
it was n’t until my father landed a job with @entity92 , however , that the motor car really became central to my life			2
we headed north to the car capital of the world , @entity97			2
back then , it was a frantic place of endless smog and honking horns			2
just like @entity15 , ' my jeans are too tight and my hairstyle is an exercise in holding back the years , ' says @entity36 , but that 's not the reason she believes she 'd be perfect for the vacant role on @entity41 here they made everything you can possibly imagine on wheels , from the great @entity112 trucks to flashy ferraris			1
cars were the lifeblood of the city			1
every year , when the time came to make the pilgrimage home to @entity121 to visit relatives , my parents would take turns driving , never stopping ( they did n’t want to have to pay for a hotel room ) , as we children sat in the back eating our way through the vast supply of my mother ’s tiny chicken sandwiches			2
my father , meanwhile , would smoke cigarillos , drink beer ( he kept a coolbox in the front ) , burp loudly ( much to my mother ’s horror and our delight ) and listen obsessively , over and over again , to whichever new music tape was grabbing his attention at the time			2
these trips gave me my musical education — and also instilled in me a great love of long - distance driving — not to mention an obsession with road movies : @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 ’s @entity114			2
@entity41 is definitely not just for male petrolheads — 40 per cent of the show ’s audience is female			2
so you see , dear lord @entity157 , to me , the motor car is so much more than a set of gears and an engine			2
it is freedom , possibility , adventure			2
and i ’m no car snob either : over the years i owned cars of all pedigrees and prices , from my first , a burgundy mini van bought for £ 500 , through various follies to a 1967 @entity171 that burnt more oil than it ever did petrol			1
but perhaps my favourite was the old @entity176 - reg @entity175 which stalled in front of the @entity178 ( the accelerator cable had snapped )			2
by the time i returned from calling the @entity182 from the phone booth — this was before mobile phones — the square had been closed off , the car surrounded by police cars and bomb disposal experts were preparing to carry out a controlled explosion on it			1
now i drive a rather more reliable sky blue @entity92 — the new model			0
we have a family car , too : a tragically dull @entity195			0
but the @entity92 is mine , and mine alone			0
despite being the size of a peanut , it has six gears ( i hate point - and - press automatics , they take all the fun out of driving ) and a special button that says ‘ sport ’ on it			1
if i press it , the exhaust makes a pleasing ‘ vroom , vroom ’ noise , and my right foot itches to go all the way to the floor			1
you see , i like to be in control when i ’m behind the wheel			0
i ’m not one of those women who pootles along at a constant 70 in the middle lane of a motorway , rummaging around in her bag for lipstick , or surreptitiously checking her texts			1
when i drive a car , i really drive it			0
@entity23 ( pictured ) received a barrage of abuse on @entity27 this week after her name was mentioned in association with presenting @entity41 perhaps it ’s the fact that i learnt to drive in @entity76 , where every other driver is either a drunk or a lunatic , but i never take my eyes off the road			1
driving for me is not just a means for getting from a to @entity236 , it ’s a destination in itself , an exercise in judgment and quick - thinking			0
on the morning school run , i take great delight in achieving just the right degree of acceleration at just the right time , so that i catch a run of green lights and never end up trapped in the wrong lane			0
i scoff at those who drive with their eyes on the satnav instead of on the tarmac			0
on motorways , i check my wing and rear view mirrors every few seconds , to make sure i am at all times aware of other vehicles around me			0
i switch lanes constantly for speed and safety — and yes , i am one of those people who drives up behind you as you ’re cruising half asleep in the fast lane and flashes their lights			0
it ’s the fast lane , guys , the clue is in the name			0
as for parking — well , suffice to say , i loathe parking sensors			0
they ’re far too jittery , and they seem to misunderstand the fundamental principle of bumpers , which is that they are for bumping			0
@entity15 ( pictured ) did not have his contract renewed with the @entity37 show after an incident with a member of the production staff as for the idea of a self - parking car , it fills me with horror			0
i ’m extremely proud of my ability to parallel park in the tiniest of places			0
there is huge intellectual satisfaction to be gained from judging the space just so			0
all this , as you can imagine , makes me the most intolerable car bore			0
as well as an infuriating person to have in the back seat			0
which is why my poor husband , who went to immense lengths to obtain his licence after the children were born , never gets a look in			0
i pretend it ’s because i do n’t trust his driving ( it took him seven attempts to pass his test )			0
but actually his driving is fine			0
it ’s just that i relish every and any opportunity to get behind the wheel			0
to feel the power beneath the pedals , to be mistress of the open road , to be in charge of the radio setting — these are some of the things that make me happiest in life			0
i drive , therefore i am			0
yours hopefully , @entity36 ( aka mrs toad ) ps. i have a full , clean driving licence .			1

@entity23 received abuse on @entity27 when her name was mentioned
the general opinion being stated was ‘ men do cars , women do cake . ’
here , @entity36 states why women are often just as keen on cars as men
