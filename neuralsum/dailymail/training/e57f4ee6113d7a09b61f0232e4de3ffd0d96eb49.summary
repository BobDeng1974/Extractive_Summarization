by @entity0 published : 20:50 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 11:13 est , 17 december 2012 trafficking of wildlife and products such as timber and rhino horn is one of the world 's biggest illegal trades , worth £ 12 billion a year , conservationists have warned			1
species such as rhinos , elephants and tigers are being poached in @entity15 and @entity16 , while antique collections , museums and even zoos in the @entity20 are at risk from criminal gangs attempting to steal rhino horn , conservation group @entity10 said			1
exhibits of rhino heads at @entity25 , @entity26 , and @entity27 have both been targeted by thieves as criminals seek to cash in on increasing demand for rhino horn as a cancer medicine or ' hangover cure ' in @entity16			1
the @entity10 has warned species such as rhinos are being poached in @entity15 and @entity16 , while antique collections , museums and even zoos in the @entity20 are at risk from criminal gangs attempting to steal rhino horn across the world , illegal trade in wildlife including timber and unregulated and unreported fishing has become a lucrative business for criminal syndicates , with profits that can be used to finance civil conflicts and terrorism , a report for @entity10 found			1
it is also pushing some species to the brink of extinction , hitting local communities in some of the poorest parts of the world and raising the threat of spreading infectious diseases			0
the internet is also making it easier for criminals to trade in illegal products around the world , the research by @entity59 warned			0
@entity66 horn is now worth more than £ 37,000 a kilo , fetching more on the black market than diamonds and cocaine , leading to a surge of poaching in @entity15 to record highs last year			2
it is particularly sought after in @entity75			0
elephants are also being targeted for their ivory , with poaching across @entity15 at record levels in 2011			0
the animals are being targeted in mass poaching incidents by criminal gangs armed with military issue machine guns , and there have been reports of @entity87 militias including the @entity89 poaching ivory for profit			1
illegal ivory found by authorities in @entity93			0
poaching across @entity15 was at record levels in 2011 @entity96 warders carry tusks that were intercepted from poachers in @entity99 where they were being transported to @entity100 and then to @entity101 a recent incident in @entity103 saw 300 elephants killed by @entity87 poachers , and @entity10 's wildlife trade expert @entity106 warned the species could face localised extinctions if poaching continued at that level			1
she said of the threats to animals such as elephants , rhinos and tigers : ' these are iconic species , they are being exploited and it 's illegal and should be stopped			0
' the report warned that species with high value to illegal traders had seen dramatic declines in recent years , including forest elephants in parts of the @entity128 basin , @entity16 elephant , @entity131 rhino and @entity133 rhino			1
in the @entity20 , auction houses saw huge prices paid for pieces from rhinos before the government took action to prevent them being exported to @entity16 to meet demand for the animal 's horn , and there has also been an increase in thefts			1
' it 's a high profit , low risk business , the chances of them being caught in some of these countries is very low , and if that happens there 's a great deal of corruption in these countries and they can offer a bribe and you do n't see convictions			2
' expert @entity106 ' it 's such a concern that enforcement authorities have spoken to all these antique collections , museums and even zoos to say they could be at risk here			2
' there 's a serious criminal network engaged in these types of theft in the @entity20 and across the @entity169 , and it is believed this is linked to the fact there is increased demand for rhino horn , ' ms @entity106 said			1
@entity66 horn is just one part of a trade worth an estimated 19 billion @entity179 dollars ( £ 12 billion ) , making it the fourth biggest global illegal trade after narcotics , counterfeiting and human trafficking			2
the report estimates that unreported and unregulated fisheries is worth 4.2 to 5.9 billion @entity179 dollars ( £ 2.6 to £ 3.7 billion ) , the illegal timber trade is worth 7 billion @entity179 dollars ( £ 4.4 billion ) and other wildlife trafficking worth up to 7.8 billion @entity179 dollars ( £ 4.8 billion )			0
among the reasons for the trade is demand for medicines , consumer goods and the desire to possess exotic pets , hunting trophies and rare plants and animals , the study suggested			0
illegal wildlife trade thrives in places with widespread corruption , weak law enforcement and where rangers , police officers and customs officials are not sufficiently trained or resourced with new tools such as dna tracing technology			0
ms @entity106 said : ' it 's a high profit , low risk business , the chances of them being caught in some of these countries is very low , and if that happens there 's a great deal of corruption in these countries and they can offer a bribe and you do n't see convictions			0
' @entity10 and its global wildlife trade programme @entity221 want wildlife trafficking to be taken seriously by governments , with improvements to law enforcement , more severe penalties imposed on criminals , efforts to tackle corruption and long - term campaigns to reduce demand for products from consumers			1
ms @entity106 added that in the @entity20 funding for the @entity235 was only secured until march 2013 , and called for continued funding at the same level and long - term security for the unit to ensure it can develop expertise .			2
