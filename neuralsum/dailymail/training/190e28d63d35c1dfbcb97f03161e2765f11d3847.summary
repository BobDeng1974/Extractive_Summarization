by @entity0 @entity1 stands on the brink of his first @entity4 campaign eight months after standing to deliver a speech at the @entity6 in honour of @entity8 and embarking upon a largely unquotable ramble about the time he replaced @entity11 at @entity12			0
@entity13 flirted with self - aggrandisement at the football writers ’ @entity16 – his audience would have been disappointed had he not - and then rescued it by delivering a decent punch - line			1
@entity8 turned out to be better than him after all , he shrugged , with reference to 2010 when @entity21 beat @entity22 in the @entity24 final , but this was the @entity26 ’s marker down in @entity27 at the start of a year when he would descend upon @entity29			1
not a success : @entity51 tampered with the backroom staff and alienated key players his meandering story was about how he refused to jettison the wisdom of @entity11 , so asked to retain him in an advisory ' upstairs ' role , and liked what he ’d seen of the hot - headed linguist - cum - coach from @entity60 , so he kept him close , too			1
yes he can work with sir @entity38 looming in the stands , if need be			0
yes , he will help nurture @entity64 and turn him into a potential successor if that is what he wants			0
@entity68 , why not ? anyone else ? strange how there seems more continuity to this appointment than when @entity51 arrived last year			1
@entity51 was chosen as the continuity candidate and yet stripped away much of @entity38 ’s backroom team and alienated key players			1
he is not famed for his human touch but @entity13 , 63 on friday , has the experience and faith in his own ability not to fear those around him or fret when all eyes turn his way , as they do now			1
can he lead @entity84 from their post-fergie gloom ? some things have fallen kindly			1
there will be no @entity89 football , so the main target is clear			2
expect snide remarks from @entity8 about @entity84 ' on holiday '			2
it was his favourite line about @entity94 last season , but there was probably some truth in it			1
time on the training field with your team is a rare commodity for managers in the @entity4			0
it helped @entity105 gate - crash the top four but @entity94 no longer have @entity106 , their inspiration and 31 - goal leading scorer			1
like @entity51 , he starts against @entity110 but unlike his predecessor who was pitched against @entity112 , @entity94 and @entity113 in his opening five @entity4 games , the next four for @entity13 are against @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118			1
do n’t be good , be lucky			0
for managers , there are good and bad times to arrive at a club			0
the minds of all those who matter at @entity36 from the boardroom to the dressing room , the @entity123 and the television screens in the @entity125 will have been opened to the idea of major surgery by last season ’s strife			2
it helped soothe the departures of @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 and it will be interesting to see the extent to which @entity13 commits to the traditions of @entity84 ’s high - tempo and fluent attacking style			1
shoulder the responsibility : @entity13 will need the likes of @entity145 to shine in his new @entity84 side still , it will not be easy			1
he will need @entity148 and @entity145 to shoulder responsibility as he organises the unit behind them and recruits new players with @entity84 ’s appeal slightly tarnished by their absence from the @entity24			2
@entity94 boss @entity105 was quick to issue the warning that the competitive nature and intensity of the @entity29 game will be unlike anything else he will have seen , especially during his last couple of years in international football			2
elsewhere in the @entity4 , the biggest teams have been bulking up			0
@entity94 have reinvested the £ 75million they banked for @entity106 and more , while champions @entity113 have quietly strengthened without losing any of their key players			1
bulking up : @entity166 is the latest player to sign for @entity94 following the sale of @entity106 @entity168 have spent freely - the arrival of @entity170 is one of the most exciting of the summer – and @entity112 have added @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 , the striker @entity8 so desperately wanted			1
together with @entity175 , signed in january , @entity112 's is starting to look like the archetypal @entity8 team , packed with muscle , cunning and commitment			1
@entity179 improved @entity180 at speed ; can he do the same at @entity43 ? he may find more resistance to his methods from more established footballers , but there is no reason why he should not			0
spurs have ground to make up on last year ’s top four , as do @entity188 and both these have the @entity190 to complicate matters			2
muscling in : @entity175 has added power to @entity112 , now looking like a typical @entity8 team for @entity195 , @entity89 football is important to the development of the club and the city but it will not help them in the scrap in the lower reaches with the three promoted teams and those who struggled last season			1
after finishing eighth in may , @entity180 have been plundered , largely by @entity94 , and must fear the slide towards those in peril			2
when it is tight , twists of fate will be magnified			0
@entity212 were stung by the loss of @entity214 , @entity110 missed @entity215 and @entity216 could have done without the @entity218 farce			0
pitfalls await , managers will be chopped and there will be aftershocks ( as well as vanishing spray ) from the @entity224			0
spurred on : if @entity179 improves @entity43 as he did @entity180 , they may challenge for fourth it less than a month since the final and players from @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity42 – of which there are many in the @entity4 – played seven games in the tournament , plus warm - up games , not to mention training through may			2
some of these players will break			0
some clubs will be equipped to cope and adjust and some will not			0
some managers will survive the carnage and others will not			0

@entity13 replaces @entity51 with @entity84 out of @entity89 competition
the *vastly* experienced @entity26 is *tipped* to fire @entity84 back into the top four
@entity112 have strengthened in summer and @entity113 look capable of defending their title
@entity168 will be strong too and @entity94 - despite selling @entity106 - will be keen to *mirror* last season 's magnificent effort
