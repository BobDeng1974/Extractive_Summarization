exclusive by @entity1 , mail online deputy political editor parts of @entity5 are now poorer than @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 , official figures reveal			1
people in the @entity10 and @entity5 ’s two poorest areas - scrape by on less than £ 14,300 a year on average			1
because @entity5 is so expensive , this leaves families in these areas worse off than those vast swathes of @entity17 , according to an @entity19 study			1
in much of the @entity22 , people 's incomes are well below the @entity19 average - in some areas by as much as a third			1
in the map ( above ) @entity5 's poorest regions are highlighted , showing how far below the @entity28 average incomes have fallen			1
the @entity30 , for example , are 36 per cent less well - off than the @entity19 norm			1
families in @entity33 meanwhile are just 16 per cent poorer - and in @entity34 23 per cent			2
in @entity35 and @entity36 , the next two poorest areas in @entity5 , people live on less than £ 16,500 a year			1
this puts them in the same bracket as @entity42 and rural @entity6 , once prices are taken into account			1
@entity5 as a whole fares a little better , with average earnings of £ 23,300 - just over the @entity19 average of £ 20,750			2
but this still leaves us out of the top 10 wealthiest countries in the @entity19			0
and this figure is propped up by @entity17 ’s runaway richest region – inner @entity53			2
in the heart of the capital the average gdp per person is £ 71,000 a year			0
this is 321 per cent of the average across the @entity19 , according to @entity61 ’s official statistics arm @entity60			0
while @entity5 is home to @entity17 's richest city , most of the country is poorer than the continent @entity53 is far and away @entity17 's capital of cash - with incomes 300 % the @entity19 average here are the top 10 richest cities : but central @entity53 ’s soaring wealth has failed to trickle down to much of the rest of the country , the figures suggest			1
@entity5 ’s seven most hard - up areas - including @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 - are poorer than any region in @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , the @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			1
the region of “ @entity89 and the @entity10 ” is now in the top five poorest areas in @entity91 - with families half as wealthy as their @entity80 counterparts on average			1
the only parts of @entity5 matching @entity80 for wealth – outside central @entity53 – are “ @entity97 , @entity98 & @entity99 ” and oil - rich “ @entity100 ” around @entity102			1
but even @entity104 ’s second wealthiest area – with average incomes of £ 32,000 – fails to make it into @entity17 ’s top 20 rich league			0
only @entity100 , with an average gdp per person of £ 33,000 , sneaks into @entity17 ’s @entity109 of wealth			0
@entity60 , which is @entity61 ’ equivalent of the @entity111 , measures wealth across the @entity19 using a measure known as ' purchasing power standards '			0
this aims to measure gdp per person but also ' takes into account differences in national price levels ' , to give a more realistic idea of how much the cash in people ’s pockets is actually worth			0
on this basis , four of the @entity22 ’s 37 regions struggle by on less than 75 per cent of the average @entity19 earnings , alongside 15 in @entity6 , nine in @entity125 , seven in the @entity126 and @entity127 , six in @entity8 and five in @entity129 and @entity130			1
towns in @entity5 are not only being left behind by wealthy parts of the @entity133 - but also by much of the @entity65 , including former @entity135 countries in @entity17 like @entity136 ( above , right ) former mining villages , like @entity138 in @entity139 ( pictured left ) are now poorer than booming cities in @entity17 like @entity141 ( right ) in @entity7 alongside @entity5 @entity34 also has four poverty regions			1
@entity143 has three , @entity144 two and @entity145 and @entity33 one each			0
families in @entity42 , @entity147 and @entity7 – which are so small that they each only count as a single region – also live on less than 75 per cent of the @entity19 average , according to the figures			2
overall , there are just eight regions of the @entity22 wealthier than the @entity19 average			0
the remaining 29 areas are poorer			2
the @entity10 and @entity30 are in the top 50 poorest regions of the whole of @entity17 – and in the top 10 deprived areas of @entity91 , according to the purchasing power league table			1
eleven regions have incomes at least 20 per cent below the @entity28 average			0
shadow treasury minister @entity163 told @entity164 the figures were a wake up call for @entity5			2
he said : ' no other @entity28 country would tolerate such a gap between its rich and poor regions			0
' to allow so many parts of the country to fall behind not only @entity53 , but most of @entity17 , is shocking			2
we 've got to take more action to have balanced prosperity			0
' the challenge of the next few years is to help these parts of the country that have been left neglected			0
' the @entity179 mp added : ' it is shocking to think parts of @entity5 are now poorer than @entity6 and other areas of @entity17			1
' when you start to take into account the prices people are having to pay in these areas - especially after seeing their incomes squeezed for years now - the contrast with @entity17 is even more stark			0
' whole streets in some of @entity5 's great towns and cities , like this one in @entity193 , have been abandoned			1
@entity195 mp @entity194 said successive @entity22 governments had ran the economy for the benefit of the @entity200 - neglecting the rest of the country			0
he said : ' many of the poorest places in @entity5 are places that have europe - style big government			2
in @entity207 and the @entity100 of @entity104 , the public sector is a huge chunk of the economy			0
' if you are going to manage the economy like @entity17 , do n't be surprised if you get @entity28 levels of wealth			0
' mr @entity194 claimed there was a ' liberal metropolitan bias ' in @entity214 against areas outside @entity53			1
he said : ' for about 40 years we have been running our currency and our economy for the benefit of finance			0
this causes a huge distortion			0
we are basically subsidising porsches and property in @entity53			2

seven areas of @entity5 poorer than anywhere in @entity83 or @entity80
@entity10 is one of the @entity65 's poverty *blackspots*
@entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 wealthier than the @entity30
outside @entity53 , only @entity233 and @entity102 keep up with @entity80
