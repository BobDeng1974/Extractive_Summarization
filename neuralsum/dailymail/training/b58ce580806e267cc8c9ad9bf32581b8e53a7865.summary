by @entity0 published : 08:19 est , 10 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:54 est , 10 february 2014 village greens across @entity4 could be under threat after a developer won permission to build on a beloved beauty spot despite a decade - long court battle by campaigners fighting to save the land			1
a property company plans to build around 80 homes on a 46 - acre patch of grassland near @entity16 in @entity17 , known as @entity18 , which was officially registered as a town green			1
a passionate group of activists have spent nine years and £ 100,000 in a bid to stop the courts stripping the land of its protected status , but last week the @entity27 ruled in favour of the developer			1
conservationists have warned that the decision could endanger @entity4 's 4,000 other town and village greens by boosting builders ' scope to overturn legal protections			1
at risk : @entity18 in @entity16 , @entity17 is set to built on after campaigners lost a bid to preserve it activists : @entity40 , right , has led the campaign to preserve the land for communal use @entity18 , also called @entity44 and @entity45 , was granted town green status in 2001 on the grounds that it had been used freely by locals for at least 20 years			1
but when development firm @entity51 bought the plot in 2005 , they applied to remove the protection so that they could develop the site			0
local residents formed the @entity56 for the protection of @entity44 and @entity45 to block the application in the courts			0
however , in 2010 the @entity60 ruled that the land should be stripped of its town green status because its use as a recreation ground did not in fact stretch back for the requisite 20 years as it was used as farmland until the mid- 1980s			2
threat : @entity51 , which owns the land , is planning to build on it and restrict public access status : @entity18 was officially registered as a town green in 2001 , but that decision has been overturned campaigners spent £ 100,000 taking the case to the @entity76 and then the @entity27 , arguing that the landowner had waited too long to appeal against the town green registration			1
2001 : @entity18 is officially registered as a town green			1
2005 : the land is bought by @entity51 , which appeals to overturn the registration			0
2008 : local residents form the @entity56 in order to fight the company 's claim			0
2010 : the @entity60 rules in favour of @entity51 on the grounds that the land was not used as a green for long enough			0
2012 : the @entity91 turns down the campaigners ' appeal as @entity51 reveals plans to build on the land			2
2014 : the @entity27 rejects the residents ' argument that the company waited too long to file its application			2
last week , @entity4 's highest court ruled in favour of @entity102 - leaving the society with an additional legal bill of £ 15,000 , which they plan to repay by holding fundraisers			2
the failed campaign was supported by organisations such as the @entity109 and the @entity110 , which are worried by the knock - on effect of the decision			0
@entity114 , general secretary for the @entity109 , said : ' we are dismayed by this decision which gives a green light to developers to grab our village greens			1
' it invites them to unpick the laws which were intended to protect land which local people have cherished for recreation , and to challenge whether the land should have been registered as a green			0
' @entity127 , a lawyer who represented the campaigners , said : ' this case will encourage speculative developers to re-look at green areas , because the registration of town green status is now worthless			1
' this is like @entity136 's getting permission to build a supermarket , and then four years later a green activist comes along and overturns the planning permission and @entity136 's have to pull down their store			0
' fears : the failure of the battle to save @entity18 could endanger other pieces of land used as town greens one reason for the initial @entity60 decision in favour of @entity51 was that the local council used outdated legislation to determine the award of town green status			1
@entity40 , chairman of the @entity18 campaign group , fears that other developers will now try to find similar minor errors in planning decisions in order to overturn legal protections			1
' this is a huge blow , but if we had not stood up and challenged the application to deregister the town green people 's rights would have been lost without any fight , ' she said			2
a spokesman for @entity51 said : ' we have no wish to deprive anyone of the use of this land			0
we will allow everyone to continue to enjoy the same use as they have had in the past until we require the land for other purposes			0
' the village green is central to the vision of traditional @entity181 life in the countryside , and for centuries certain patches of land have been recognised as having a special status within rural communities			0
however , it was not until the creation of the @entity190 in 1965 that greens were first afforded formal legal protection			0
the law - now determined by the @entity194 - allows local residents to apply for town or village green status for any plot of land which has been used by the community for at least 20 years			2
the land has to be used ' as of right ' - that is , openly and without asking permission from the owner - in order to qualify			0
it is forbidden to build on , interfere with or fence off registered town greens , meaning that registrations are often opposed by landowners who fear their property plunging in value .			1
