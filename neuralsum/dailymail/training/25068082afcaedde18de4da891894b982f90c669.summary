a 25ft monster ' shark ' with chainsaw teeth that roamed the prehistoric seas 270 million years ago has been revealed by scientists			1
the bizarre fish @entity6 , an early ancestor of sharks , had a conveyor belt of jagged teeth that spiralled out of its lower jaw and ripped prey to shreds			1
using state of the art scanners to create @entity17 virtual reconstructions of its jaws , researchers have now discovered what the ancient beast would have looked like as it homed in on marine animals			0
@entity6 , an early ancestor of sharks , had a conveyor belt of jagged teeth that spiralled out of its lower jaw and ripped prey to shreds located at the back , the teeth were ' saw - like ' with the jaw creating a rolling back and slicing mechanism			1
professor @entity32 , of @entity33 , said : ' we were able to answer where the set of teeth fit in the animal			2
' they fit in the back of the mouth , right next to the back joint of the jaw			1
' we were able to refute it might have been located at the front of the jaw			2
' the creature , unlike any shark alive today , grew up to twenty - five feet in length and weighed almost half a ton ( 71 stone ) , making it the biggest fish in the sea			0
the large ' spiral ' fossils of teeth are all that remain from the hundred specimens found around the world as its skeleton was made of cartilage , just like its modern descendants , which does not preserve well			2
professor @entity32 , of @entity33 , used state of the art scanners to create @entity17 virtual reconstructions of its jaws @entity6 's appearance has long mystified scientists because no one could work out how these teeth , which resemble a spiral saw blade , fit into it			1
geoscientist prof @entity32 said : ' @entity74 ( computerised tomography ) scans of a unique specimen from @entity77 show the spiral of teeth within the jaws of the animal , giving new information on what the animal looked like , and how it ate			2
' the findings , published in the @entity87 journal @entity88 , are based on firm evidence fed into computers at his special virtualization laboratory			0
another major breakthrough was the beast is more closely related to ratfish than sharks			0
both species have cartilage , rather than bone , but are classified differently			0
the 3d models created by the team show how the ' spiral ' teeth fitted in the head of the animal it was always assumed the @entity6 was a shark , but it is more closely related to ratfish , a @entity109			1
the main thing it has in common with sharks is the structure of its teeth , everything else is @entity117			0
based on the information , the @entity118 is creating a life size reconstruction of a modest thirteen foot long @entity6 for an exhibition this summer , which will also include artwork by world renowned scientific illustrator @entity123			1
rocks in southeastern @entity77 have preserved the largest , most abundant and pristine specimens of @entity6 many of which include the lower jaw cartilage , teeth and rare impressions of skin			1
other remains have been found in @entity135 and @entity136 when these regions were covered in sea more than 250 million years ago			0
the researchers created several artist 's impressions of the fish to try and work out what it looked like , before a 3d reconstruction revealed the truth ( bottom )			0

@entity6 had a conveyor belt of jagged teeth that spiralled out of its lower jaw and ripped prey to shreds
appearance had *baffled* scientists because no one could work out how the teeth fitted in its mouth
