by @entity0 when @entity2 was born in @entity3 , @entity4 in 1921 , no one could have foreseen that a couple of months after her 19th birthday , she would be working as a nurse in wartime , tending injured survivors of the @entity11 evacuation			1
her mother died when @entity2 was just three weeks old , and she was brought up by her beloved aunt in a part of @entity15 so rural that the family transport was a donkey and trap			1
her father , a poetry - loving visionary who fought alongside @entity20 and @entity21 in the @entity22 , passed on his passion for ideas and his independent - mindedness to @entity2			1
saviour : @entity2 , centre , tends to a patient in wartime			1
she was aged just 19 when she nursed survivors at @entity11 there were few opportunities for work in @entity15			1
@entity2 ’s elder brother , @entity34 , emigrated to @entity35 , while @entity2 travelled to @entity36 in 1939 to begin training as a nurse at @entity39			1
during her probation she began an intimate diary , which is now in the @entity42			1
the day she started her journal , may 31 , 1940 , began like any other			2
@entity2 noted that ‘ staff nurse @entity44 reduced me to tears twice before the 9am break ’			1
but then the order came to prepare the ward for casualties , and a fleet of ambulances arrived bearing injured @entity11 survivors			1
among the most seriously wounded was private @entity53 , so severely burned that his naked body had to be suspended on straps above his bed			2
‘ he is about 18 — my age , ’ @entity59 @entity58 , the skipper of the @entity60 , which sank on its second return trip across the @entity62 , ‘ got off lightly ’ with a broken leg			0
he described the motley fleet of coasters , paddle steamers , fishing boats and pleasure boats that joined the rescue mission as ‘ the queerest and most nondescript flotilla that ever was ’			0
@entity2 had a narrow escape when a @entity36 hotel where she was staying on leave was bombed in @entity75 , and she took part in the @entity77 , where patients and nurses were lodged in tents , the water supply was 2km away , and the sterilising equipment was so primitive that she commented : ‘ i am sure @entity82 was better off in the @entity83			1
’ 3,076 @entity85 nurses lost their lives during @entity87			0
throughout it all , @entity2 ’s sense of humour and her high spirits rarely failed			1
in @entity93 there were dances with the @entity95 and a string of dashing chaps keen to take her out to dinner			0
but a note of melancholy was never far away			0
‘ transient fleeting friendships are a part of the war , ’ @entity2 wrote			1
‘ there is never time to get to know anybody , and for some there may not be a tomorrow			0
’ one man she did manage to keep in touch with was @entity110 , a subaltern whom she met on a blind date in @entity93 in 1945			0
unlike @entity2 , who had won prizes in @entity15 for her dancing , @entity110 ’s sense of rhythm was hopeless , but he made up for it with ‘ a lovely sense of humour ’			2
love in a time of war : @entity2 met her future husband @entity123 , while on active service in @entity125			2
he was four years younger than @entity2 — ‘ i feel quite ancient at times , have seen too much suffering , ’ she reflected			2
just two weeks after they met , he asked her to marry him , and she accepted			0
their marriage would last until @entity2 ’s death in 1997 , aged 76 , but they faced plenty of obstacles during their engagement , not least the question of what @entity2 could wear as a wartime bride			1
‘ i never realised that getting married entailed such a lot of fuss , ’ she complained			0
resourceful as ever , she wrote to a @entity36 film studio , asking to borrow one of their gowns , and they offered her a white @entity147 dress and lace veil worn by the actress @entity148			0
( there is photograph of @entity2 on her wedding day , looking fabulous in her borrowed finery )			2
@entity154 bride : @entity2 in her nurse 's uniform and on her wedding day , wearing a white @entity158 dress @entity2 is a talented writer and a humane observer of her remarkable experiences			1
her diary is full of vivid , sometimes shocking vignettes , such as the starving @entity164 prisoners of war admitted to the @entity125 hospital where she was working in december 1945			2
‘ what are we to feel or say when prisoners come in from our own pow camps suffering from			0
advanced starvation , ’ she wrote furiously , predicting that ‘ this little episode will be covered up			0
nothing of it will reach the newspapers or the people at home			0
’ proud legacy : @entity2 and @entity110 with their four children , who all remember her courage and sense of adventure but nothing crushed @entity2 ’s spirits for long			2
soon she had organised the entire ward — the @entity164 working alongside their former enemies — into making @entity189 decorations : ‘ the ward is in a state of happy chaos — most un-military , but i am determined that [ it ] will be a happy place this @entity189			0
’ in a postscript to this fascinating and deeply moving book , @entity2 ’s daughter @entity194 reflects on the courage and sense of adventure that took her mother as a teenager from rural @entity15 to the dangers of nursing in wartime @entity203			1
‘ she had great empathy for others , and was determined to do something useful , ’ she writes			0
it is an epitaph that anyone would be proud of .			0
