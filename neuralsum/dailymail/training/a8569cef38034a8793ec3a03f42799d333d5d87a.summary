by @entity1 reporter published : 22:12 est , 30 august 2012 updated : 22:15 est , 30 august 2012 the @entity3 psychiatrist charged in the deadly @entity5 shooting rampage told a judge on thursday that he chooses to defy @entity3 regulations by not shaving his beard because it follows his religious faith			1
it was maj @entity13 's first time speaking in court since showing up with a beard in violation of @entity3 regulations in june , prompting several fines and questioning for his defiance			1
' in the name of almighty @entity21 , i am a muslim , ' @entity13 told col. @entity22 in his response to the judge			1
' i believe my religion requires me to wear a beard			0
' the beard : maj @entity13 is seen left , before the 2009 shooting that killed 13 at the @entity5 , @entity31 base with him seen more recently , right , while refusing to shave on reasons of his religious faith @entity13 said his beard was not a show of disrespect to the court			1
the pretrial hearing was the first since a military appeals court stopped proceedings aug. 15 to consider the dispute over @entity13 's beard less than a week before his court - martial was to begin			1
@entity22 held @entity13 in contempt of court and fined him $ 1,000 for a sixth time on thursday , and again sent him to a nearby room to watch the rest of the proceedings on closed - circuit television			1

@entity13 faces the death penalty if convicted in the november 2009 attack that killed 13 and wounded more than two dozen others on the @entity3 post			2
@entity22 , who has said he would order @entity13 to be forcibly shaved before the trial if he did not get rid of the beard himself , said thursday that he will order a forcible shaving next week			1

contempt of court : @entity13 , seen after charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder , is held in contempt of court for his beard which could be forcibly shaved earlier this week , the @entity80 ruled that @entity13 's appeal was premature because @entity22 has not issued a definitive order for @entity13 to be forcibly shaved			2
the court said that if @entity22 issues that order , he must address several issues , including whether the @entity86 applies in the court - martial			0
some witnesses for prosecutors and defense attorneys may testify at another pretrial hearing at @entity5 next week to address those issues			0
@entity13 's attorneys have argued that forcing him to shave would violate his religious freedoms			0
they also have said @entity13 would n't shave because he had a premonition that his death is imminent , and does n't want to die beardless because he believes not having one is a sin			0
according to military regulations , soldiers who disobey orders to be clean - shaven can be forcibly shaved			1
@entity22 has said he wants @entity13 in the courtroom during the court - martial to prevent a possible appeal over the beard if @entity13 is convicted			0
