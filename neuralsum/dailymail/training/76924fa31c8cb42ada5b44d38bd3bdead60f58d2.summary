thanks to celebrities like @entity2 and the @entity3 , bold , defined eyebrows are coveted by many young women			1
it was a look that student @entity7 , 24 , from @entity8 , wanted but she became sick of spending hours with an eyebrow pencil to get the shape just right every day			1
' every morning was daunting - drawing them on and feeling depressed if they did n't look right , ' she told @entity14 show bodyshockers			1
but she now admits it has n't given her the results she desired			2
she said : ' having the tattoos was excruciating			2
i told the tattooist i wanted black eyebrows but i did n't think they would be this black			1
' i do n't know what i was thinking as i 'm naturally blonde			2
' the student , who lives in @entity33 , had to dye her hair brown and cut a chunky fringe in an attempt to make her bold brow less noticeable			1
the student had a fringe cut to try and hide her tattoos and had to pencil them in when they started fading and turning blue in colour @entity7 said she now finds her appearance embarrassing as her eyebrows make her look ' constantly surprised			1
' the move has n't saved her time on her morning beauty regime as hoped either , as she still has to use her eyebrow pencil because the tattoos have started to turn blue as they 've faded			0
in addition , she has to spend longer doing her hair to ensure they 're not on show			0
she said : ' it was supposed to be a quick fix so i did n't have to do all this plucking , shaving and painting them on			0
' but now before i leave the house i have to spend ages doing hair to make sure they ca n't be seen			0
' @entity7 had been trying to emulate the defined brows of @entity2 , left , and the @entity3 @entity7 added that the tattoos have also made her feel self - conscious , so she 's not as sociable as she used to be			1
she said : ' i do n't tend to go out much now as i have it in my head that people are looking at me - that 's most upsetting			0
' i want them gone '			0
she is hoping to eventually achieve this by having painful laser removal surgery			0
@entity73 is on @entity14 wednesdays at 10pm			0

@entity7 , 24 , from @entity8 , wanted bold , defined eyebrows like @entity2
the student *decided* to have fake eyebrows tattooed onto her face
but she now *regrets* the look and is *desperate* to have them removed
