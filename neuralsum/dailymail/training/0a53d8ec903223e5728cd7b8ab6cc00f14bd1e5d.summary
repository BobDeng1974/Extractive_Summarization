by @entity0 published : 13:06 est , 10 august 2013 updated : 14:28 est , 10 august 2013 at more than four times the size of the average football pitch and around the same length it is little wonder it can move , let alone carry 18,000 20ft steel containers laden with cargo halfway around the world			1
but the world 's largest cargo ship proved that small and nippy is not always best when it comes to getting from a to @entity13 the @entity14 set off on its maiden voyage last month and has now visited six different @entity17 ports on its 23 day route around @entity17 and @entity19			1
the video shows the ship gliding through the water towards the dock and being moored using heavy duty ropes			0
the giant vessel dwarfs cars and workers on the dock as the ship 's crew look over the side of the ship all the way down to dry land			2
the video then shows cargo containers being loaded neatly row upon row by automated cranes before the ship sets sail again			0
empty : the @entity14 vessel can fit around 18,000 shipping containers in its vast hull impressive : the time lapse video shows an automated crane system slowly filling up the ship as night falls eventually there will be 20 of the @entity14 ships produced and they will sail on the world 's biggest shipping route between @entity73 and @entity74 in 23 days stopping at eight ports in @entity17 and another six in @entity19			1
the fleet is called the @entity14 because its manufacturers claim it refers to the boat 's economy of scale , energy efficiency and its ' environmental improvement proficiency '			1
the company will save around Â£ 750,000 on fuel in a typical journey between @entity86 and @entity87			0
the ship is designed for maximum storage and efficiency rather than speed			2
instead of a streamlined hull , the boat is more boxy so that it can carry more cargo and features a special engine that recycles heat and uses it to gain extra propulsion			0
it is also the greener option when it comes to transporting a range of goods across the world - it produces just 3g co2 per ton of cargo compared to an airplane which emits 560g per ton			0
the ship , which has cargo space the equivalent of 36,000 cars or 111 million pairs of trainers , would be longer than the @entity114 if the famous @entity116 landmark was laid flat			0
giant of the seas : the huge boat pictured on its maiden voyage in @entity17 huge : the ship is a record breaking 400 metres long			1

the @entity14 is the equivalent of four football pitches in length
20 of the record breaking ships are currently being built in @entity17
the ships will circle a busy shipping route between @entity17 and @entity19
the vessel is designed for efficiency and to be environmentally *friendly*
