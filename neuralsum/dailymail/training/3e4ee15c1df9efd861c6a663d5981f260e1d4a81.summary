by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is not used to being a substitute and the boredom of watching @entity6 cruise to victory against @entity8 clearly got to him			2
the striker started @entity6 's opening two @entity11 group games against @entity12 and @entity13 but found himself on the bench for monday 's clash as @entity16 rang the changes after two consecutive defeats			0
next to him sat @entity20 - who had come off with seven minutes of the game left to play			2
with the result beyond doubt and no prospect of getting on , @entity2 had an idea to keep himself entertained			0
the 25 - year - old appeared to try to wax his team - mate 's leg with what looked like tape			1
the prank barely registered with @entity20 , who shot his team - mate a confused and unimpressed look and continued to enjoy the display his team - mates were putting on			1
opener : @entity38 's first - half goal set @entity6 on their way to an easy win at the double : @entity44 striker @entity43 makes it 2 - 0 to @entity6 after the break clincher : @entity47 sealed the win with a third goal late on the bizarre moment draws to an end @entity6 's disastrous @entity11 defence			1
the 3 - 0 win over @entity8 , courtesy of goals from @entity38 , @entity43 and @entity47 , was scant consolation for a team used to so success			1
for @entity2 the tournament has been a disappointing , with the striker failing to score			2
although some mitigiation must be made for the fact he had just recovered from a leg injury			0
@entity20 , meanwhile , is rumored to be on the brink of intentional retirement			0
if the 32 - year - old does call it a day , then at least he wo n't have to put up with @entity2 's pranks anymore .			0

@entity2 was an *unused* substitute during the 3 - 0 win
striker pranked his team - mate after @entity20 came off in the 83rd minute
