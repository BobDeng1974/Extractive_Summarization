by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 pulls a story from the archives ; one from the days when he was the undisputed best left back in @entity5			1
‘ it was many moons ago , ’ said @entity2 with a smile			1
‘ i was at the @entity10 dinner when this guy from @entity12 came up and asked me if i ’d mind saying hello to their left back , @entity13			2
he said it would give him a big boost , so i said , ‘ ‘ no worries ’ ’			2
‘ i said , ‘ ‘ @entity18 , how you doing ’ ’ and all that			2
then , as i ’m walking away , this fella ’s whispered to me , ‘ ‘ that lad ’s going to take your place one day , @entity25 ’ ’			2
‘ i ’d had a couple of beers and i said , ‘ ‘ yeah , right ’ ’			2
plenty to offer : @entity2 believes @entity29 can do well for @entity5 at the @entity30 ‘ he took my place at a time when i was n’t in the first team			1
@entity34 had dropped me at @entity35 and @entity36 phoned me at home and said he could n’t pick me while i was n’t in the first team			2
‘ i said , “ @entity39 enough , thanks for calling ”			2
it happened quite sharpish really			0
’ @entity2 played 86 times for his country and went to four major tournaments as the first - choice left back for @entity45 and sir @entity36			1
he has suffered addiction problems since retiring but is back in work and getting his life in order			0
stepping up : @entity50 is expected to go to the @entity30 and could be first choice left back the only full back to play more games for @entity5 is @entity29 , who has 107 caps , but the 33 - year - old has lost his place in the @entity58 team this season and must wait to find if that has cost him a place in @entity63 ’s squad			1
@entity63 will select his 23 players plus those on standby on monday , and he must choose left backs from @entity29 , @entity50 and @entity67			1
‘ @entity29 has n’t played that much this season and i feel maybe he ’s started to doubt himself for the first time since he was very young , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ the flip side is that he might be fresher and well rested			0
young star : @entity72 's @entity67 is a possible contender for the @entity5 squad ‘ @entity50 is a better crosser , no doubt in my mind , and he can be dangerous from a free - kick			1
set pieces and crosses can be so important in big matches , when it ’s tense			0
he ’s also comfortable taking a penalty			0
i ’m not sure if @entity29 is after missing the last one			1
’ @entity2 added : ‘ these days , the full back position is more about helping your centre half and going forward			1
they do n’t stop as many crosses as they did , but i do n’t think there are as many wingers trying to come at you			0
‘ the modern full back has to create on the ball			2
they do n’t knock it long from full back , like they did			0
they get forward and cross the ball as much as wingers			2
that was more my sort of game ; i loved to attack			0
ever present : @entity2 won 86 caps for @entity5 before he lost his place at @entity35 and was dropped ‘ @entity67 is exciting			1
he has ability and aggression			0
more than the other two , who tend to go wide on to their left foot , he can go either way			0
he can come inside and use both his feet			0
he ’s a little bit different			0
he ’s younger and he ’s going to be keener			0
‘ i ’ve a sneaking feeling that @entity63 wants to take @entity67 and i can not honestly see him taking all three , that ’s wasting a place			1
personally , i ’d take @entity29 and @entity50			1
@entity29 ’s a good strong defender and @entity50 ’s got that lovely delivery			1
i ’d play @entity29 when you have to defend and @entity50 if you think they ’re not so strong down the right			1
‘ @entity67 is an excellent player but he ’s for the future			1
he is one for the @entity122			0
’ psycho : @entity13 replaced @entity2 as @entity5 's left back in the late 1980s @entity72 defender @entity67 , 18 , has played once for @entity5 , making his debut as a half - time substitute replacing @entity29 in the friendly against @entity127 in march			1
was it the symbolic passing of the left back ’s torch ? ‘ @entity67 will know , if he ’s picked , that he probably wo n’t start at the @entity30 , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ if that happens , he ’s got to look up to @entity50 or @entity29 and say to himself , “ i want to be better than you ”			1
‘ from the age of 18 , every season you should add something to your game			2
it might be that you read the game a little bit better			0
it might be learning to time your jump			0
it could be the smallest thing , but it ’s important			0
‘ i used to watch @entity29 when he came into the @entity35 side and he ’d get caught on the inside trying to tackle with his left foot , going across his body			1
he gave a few penalties away like that , but he worked on it until he could tackle with his right foot			0
‘ whenever he had a slight problem , @entity29 worked hard at it			1
that ’s the attitude that ’s got him 100 caps			0
without it , there ’s no way he ’d have got 100 caps			0
‘ i think @entity160 went through a period when he thought he ’d arrived and he did n’t play so well , then he went to @entity162 and realised he had to pull his finger out because he had n’t quite made it yet			0
he ’s improved from there to become a very good full back			0

@entity2 believes @entity29 will be fresh for the @entity30 after not playing much this season
*ex-england* defender believes @entity50 is a better crosser of the ball
@entity67 is a player for the future , according to @entity2
