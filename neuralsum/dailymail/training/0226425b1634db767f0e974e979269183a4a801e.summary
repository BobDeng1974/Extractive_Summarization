after @entity2 claimed an impressive 266 - run victory against @entity4 in the third test at the @entity6 , @entity1 's @entity0 runs the rule over how both sets of players rated			1
@entity10 9.5 @entity11 shows what a clear mind and runs can do			1
win the toss and bat first			1
outstanding from the first ball to the last			2
did n’t put a foot wrong			2
@entity19 4 struggles outside off stump and as an opener that is a problem			2
has to work out what to play and what to leave			2
@entity24 9 brilliant in both innings ; trying to set match up in first and going after it in second			1
showed he can bat at different tempos			1
would n’t have been given out in either innings with @entity33 stellar outing : it all went right for @entity10 in @entity36 with @entity2 ending their search for a test win @entity39 9 brilliant return to form in first innings			1
left the ball better outside off stump early and gave @entity2 the required tempo in absence of @entity46 , giving his side chance to bowl @entity4 out twice			1
@entity50 7 excellent second innings in one - day mode , selflessly going after runs quickly			1
useful wicket and outstanding fielding			0
@entity56 9 remarkable six - wicket haul against @entity4			1
there are some great spinners who have n’t done that			0
no longer a part - timer			1
has worked hard on the pace he needs to bowl and it ’s paying off			0
six of the best : @entity56 ( right ) celebrates taking the wicket of @entity69 @entity70 9 had a little bit of luck in his first innings but he made @entity4 pay with a superb aggressive innings			1
his glove - work impressed me even more on a spinning wicket			1
@entity79 6 did not bowl badly and i would look to keep him in the squad			0
if @entity81 is n’t available next week , @entity2 need a swing bowler like @entity83			1
@entity84 4 has n't been helped by being left out and then brought back in			1
needs to be playing because he ’s completely lost his rhythm			0
took a brilliant catch and did n’t let his head drop			0
safe hands : @entity84 caught both @entity92 and @entity93 ( above ) in the slips @entity95 8 great hostile bowling without being too short			0
some of the short balls he did bowl nipped back in and caused serious issues			1
back to his best and looked like he enjoyed himself			1
@entity81 9.5 his control of line , length and swing and the way he set up players like @entity92 was world - class			1
delivered when his captain needed him			2
mr reliable : @entity81 , who faces a possible suspension , was at his immaculate best total 84/110 @entity114 5 played nicely in the first innings until he dragged one on			0
a good player but a dopey run out in second with no real dive will have made @entity122 cross			2
@entity92 5 has a problem with @entity81 bowling around the wicket			0
has worked with @entity122 to change his alignment but his technique , staying so leg side , looks vulnerable in @entity2			1
place under threat from @entity129			0
do n't look back : @entity130 is caught by @entity84 off the bowling of @entity81 @entity132 4 another couple of soft dismissals			2
he got a good ball in the first innings from @entity95 but he needs to knuckle down and get back to his best			2
@entity137 5.5 looks vulnerable outside off stump			0
got himself in twice but he has been playing the shot of the day rather than the innings of the day			0
that is a big difference			0
@entity144 8 played really well in both innings			0
people talk about @entity132 looking like @entity147 but i think @entity144 is more like him			0
very organised and in good nick			0
the little wall : @entity144 hit half centuries in both innings at the @entity6 @entity153 4 do n't have a problem with him hitting down the ground because too many @entity157 batsmen were passive against @entity56			1
but he needs to commit fully to the shot and it did n’t work for @entity4 playing the extra batsman			1
@entity162 6 captained the side well and batted nicely in the first innings			0
at times his glove - work looked a little bit sloppy in comparison to @entity168			2
might think about the balance of the side			0
@entity171 6 couple of soft dismissals			0
bowled ok but too quickly to really find the rough			0
@entity174 left - arm spinners go up and down to land it in the rough but @entity171 is constantly trying to fire it in			2
and that 's out : @entity171 is bowled by @entity56 on day five as @entity4 crumble to defeat @entity69 6 not at his best but he still bowled pretty well			1
pitched the ball up and swung it and produced a couple of really good deliveries			0
looked a little short of pace			0
@entity184 4 thought he ’d be bowling better than this in the series			2
in the absence of @entity188 he needed to stand up more and take more responsibility but it did n’t happen			0
will be looking over his shoulder			0
he ’ll bowl a lot worse and take wickets			2
had @entity10 dropped , @entity24 not given and @entity39 lbw turned down			1
nice to see a genuine no 11 back in test cricket ! total 57.5/110			1

@entity2 did not look back after captain @entity10 won the toss and *elected* to bat
the 266 - run victory was their first for 10 test matches
@entity10 and @entity39 returned to form with the bat , while @entity24 was again *exceptional* , scoring *194* runs in @entity36
and @entity56 took six wickets , taking his tally for the series to 15
@entity2 face @entity4 at @entity213 for the *fourth* test on *thursday*
