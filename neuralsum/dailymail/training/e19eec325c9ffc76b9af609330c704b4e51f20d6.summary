by @entity0 published : 06:41 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 18:08 est , 30 october 2013 when his 11 - month - old @entity2 vanished down a rabbit hole , the @entity1 tried everything he could to find her – to no avail			1
by the time the storm of @entity10 arrived on monday , little @entity8 had been missing for three weeks and the @entity11 had given up all hope of ever seeing her again			1
but half an hour after the storm tore through his 900 - acre estate near @entity16 in @entity17 , a familiar , if bedraggled , figure staggered on to the lawn covered with dirt and sand			1
@entity22 ( pictured ) and his parents spent a day and a half digging to find @entity25 lord and @entity27 live on an arable farm at @entity29 , @entity16 , @entity17 the ferocious storm which caused so much destruction had saved @entity25 by uprooting a tree , allowing her to crawl free of the hole she had been stuck in for three weeks			1
last night the @entity11 ’s wife , 77 - year - old @entity36 , described the dog ’s survival as ‘ truly remarkable ’			2
she said : ‘ the storm hit us at around 8.30am on monday and we were watching the trees bend in the wind			1
‘ then about half an hour later , my daughter looked out of the window upstairs and saw this yellowish animal crawling and staggering across the lawn			1
‘ she screamed when she realised it was @entity48 and rushed outside to pick her up			2
‘ our reaction was one of absolute disbelief			2
we were all thrilled and flabbergasted that she had returned			1
‘ it seemed so improbable that she could have survived underground for so long , but we have no other explanation			2
’ the family believe @entity25 was rescued by the storm after a tree where she was buried fell down the fox terrier originated in the 19th century and is related to the modern white terrier breeds			1
the dogs were originally bred to dive into and flush foxes out of their holes during foxhunts			2
they general grow to no more than 40cm in height and weigh between seven and eight kilograms			0
the average lifespan of the dog is around 15 years			0
lady @entity36 said @entity48 was covered in sand and her claws were worn down			0
‘ the sand had got into her eyes and she was incredibly skinny , ’ she said			0
‘ the strong winds must have shifted the tree roots or something else underground to free her			1
‘ i have veterinary friends who have never heard of a dog surviving so long underground			0
‘ they think that the sandy soil might have helped her because she would have been able to drink water dripping through			0
’ @entity48 vanished on the afternoon of october 7			0
the puppy was spotted by her daughter , @entity86 , 42 , from her bedroom window the fifth @entity11 , @entity88 , 80 , had taken her out for a walk in the grounds of @entity92 house when she bolted after a rabbit			1
’ later @entity36 returned to the spot with her eldest son @entity22 , who has the title @entity97 , and they could hear a faint bark			1
two workers dug with spades until nightfall but they could not reach @entity25			0
@entity25 is now making a healthy recovery but has not lost her fascination with rabbit holes despite the ordeal ‘ the next day we carried on digging and brought in the excavator to shift all the sandy soil from the area , but we heard absolutely nothing , ’ said @entity36			1
lord @entity97 , 44 , said he is in no doubt that @entity25 ’s escape was ‘ thanks to @entity10 ’			2
‘ it is quite fitting that @entity10 saved her because he is the patron saint of lost causes			0
she was a lost cause if ever there was one – lost and buried underground the @entity1 title was created in 1892 by @entity123 politician @entity88 , who held office as home secretary at one stage			2
the current @entity1 , who succeeded his father in 1978 to become the fifth earl , has a phd in the biology of cave swiftlets – the @entity133 birds that build edible nests			0
the 80 - year - old has also held a number of positions in the voluntary , public and private sector			0
he has served as an elected parish and district councillor , a member of the @entity142 , a trustee of the @entity143 and as chairman of the @entity145			0
lady @entity146 , meanwhile , has made her name as a local food campaigner in @entity17			1
