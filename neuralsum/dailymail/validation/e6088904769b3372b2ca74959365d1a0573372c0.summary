if you press against the card you get a wide - eyed , curled effect without getting lots of product on your eyelid , ' she advised			0
she also swears by using lip balm as an eyeshadow to give a ' glossy ' finish ( her favourite is @entity145 ) , and she often uses the pink tinted ones as blusher			2
when it comes to beauty , 24 - year - old @entity5 , an accomplished cook who runs her own cookery @entity149 channel , believes it 's all about what you put in			1
' i like to eat healthy , ' she said			0
' i love good greens and fish and i 'm not really a snacker			0
' luckily the backstage catering at fashion week has improved			0
there used to be nothing or just really boring food but they 've really stepped it up			0
@entity165 even had an amazing gluten - free buffet backstage at her show			0
' as a @entity169 regular , who was scouted in @entity170 in her teens , @entity5 was on the road to success very early in her career			1
she 's clocked up campaigns for @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 and walked in the @entity181 closing ceremony alongside @entity182 and @entity183			0

' when she 's not on the catwalk , @entity5 is a proud mother to her son @entity185 , who was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia ( l to @entity118 ) @entity202 , @entity121 , @entity5 , @entity183 , @entity203 and @entity182 attend the @entity205 2015 show @entity45 , current @entity46 , @entity47 and owner of award - winning salon @entity49 ( charlottemensah.com ) gives her top tips for not over-processing @entity23 hair : @entity210 if you ’re experiencing hair damage and loss , the only option to minimise this is to begin a strict weekly regime of deep conditioning treatments such as the @entity218 in - salon @entity216 , which contains filloxane technology to instantly penetrate the hair fibre , filling into weak areas , giving stronger , fuller results			1
supplement haircare with diet i ’d also recommend following a balanced diet with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables that provide the body with the natural and necessary vitamins and minerals that are the basis for healthy skin and hair			1
you need to balance the topical products you are using with a healthy lifestyle including the right foods , 6 - 8 glasses of water a day and enough sleep to help from the inside out as well			0
use natural oils avoid products that are heavy in mineral oil as this can block the pores			2
there are natural oils that do the same job and yield great results			1
you can massage natural oils into the hairline where breakage is happening to stimulate the blood circulation in these areas and promote regrowth			2
@entity258 while it ’s understandable why women may want to wear a wig to cover up hair loss or breakage , i ’d highly recommend taking it off when indoors and overnight to allow the scalp to breathe			2
colouring @entity268 colouring any hair type can be damaging to condition , however ammonia - free formulas like @entity270 are much gentler on the hair			2
these formulas also tend to amplify shine , which gives the appearance of healthier hair			0
@entity277 when your hair is weaker or suffering from breakage , make sure you choose combs that have wide teeth and no seams , which can snag the hair			0
@entity285 , which are made from a single sheet of cellulose acetate , a non-petroleum based plastic derived from plants that has been found to create less static in the hair			0
they are then hand polished and buffed to create soft , rounded teeth that will not damaged the hair or scalp			2
due to the way the teeth are cut rather than moulded , they are much less likely to snag causing split ends , but instead stimulate the natural oils inside the hair cuticle encouraging each strand to lie flat , creating healthy , strong and shiny hair			2
@entity304 ensure you are coupling your deep condition treatments with regular trims every 6 - 8 weeks to encourage healthy hair			0
while hair loss often happens around the hairline , a lot of damage occurs through the mid-lengths and ends , so ensuring they are in the best condition will give the illusion of an all - over healthier , fuller head of hair .			2
