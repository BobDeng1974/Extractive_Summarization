engineers are working on the @entity1 - the supersonic car that 's faster than a speeding bullet which is hoped to break the land speed record			1
the @entity6 - made vehicle , which is powered by a @entity8 jet engine and a rocket , is being built as the fastest car in the world to beat the 763mph ( 1228km/h ) current record which was set by @entity15 car on 15 october 1997			0
bloodhound is being put together at its design centre in @entity18 , @entity19 as part of a private venture although it has substantial in - kind support from the @entity6 government and is being used as a education resource with the hope that it will encourage more pupils to follow science and technology - related courses			1
the project team consists of some of the world ’s most revered engineering talent , led by project director @entity34 and will be driven by @entity35			2
a jet engine is moved underneath a body panel of the @entity1 vehicle currently taking shape at its design centre in @entity18 on march 5 @entity40 from the @entity41 and build technician @entity42 put the cockpit glass cover in place as they work on the @entity1 the @entity6 - made vehicle , which is powered by a @entity8 jet engine and a rocket , is being built as the fastest car in the world to beat the 763mph ( 1228km/h ) current record which was set by @entity15 car on 15 october 1997 a mock up of what the completed supercar will finally look like goes on display in a @entity6 street to the amusement of passersby and a police officer the car has a slender body of approximately 13.4m length with two front wheels within the body and two rear wheels mounted externally within wheel fairings it weighs 7.5 tonnes and the engines produce more than 135,000 horsepower - more than 6 times the power of all the @entity71 cars on a starting grid put together engineers work on the carbon - fibre body of the @entity1 vehicle , which is powered by a massive @entity8 jet engine and a rocket it is hoped that when finished , the @entity1 car , which is powered by a @entity8 jet engine and a rocket , will break the current land speed record of 763mph or 1228km/h the huge @entity84 jet engine ( pictured ) is so powerful it would be able to suck all the air out of an average sized house in three seconds engineers work on the wiring loom in the rear end of the @entity1 vehicle which is a private venture although it has substantial in - kind support from the @entity6 government the supersonic vehicle is also being used as a education resource with the hope that it will encourage more pupils to follow science and technology - related courses the project team consists of some of the world ’s most revered engineering talent , led by project director @entity34 and the car will be driven by @entity35 work continues on electrical components for the @entity1 a private venture led by project director @entity34 with support from the government engineers work on a body panel of the @entity1 vehicle currently taking shape at its design centre in @entity18 in @entity19 engineers are working on the @entity1 - the supersonic car that 's faster than a speeding bullet which is hoped to break the land speed record the car is a mix of car and aircraft technology , with the front half being a carbon fibre monocoque like a racing car and the back half being a metallic framework and panels like an aircraft the @entity1 will travel 150 metres in the blink of an eye and could cover the distance of four and a half football pitches in one second @entity40 from the @entity41 and build technician @entity42 put the cockpit glass cover in place as they work on the @entity1 @entity136 engineers work on a tail fin of the @entity1 vehicle , which is powered by a @entity8 jet engine and a rockets the vehicle 's tail fin takes shape under the watchful eye of a team of @entity136 engineers who are hoping to create the world 's fastest car the bloodhound is so powerful that if it was fired into the air , the rocket and engine would blast the car to an altitude of 25,000ft @entity136 engineers work on a tail fin of the supersonic vehicle which is faster than a bullet fired from a @entity157 and can cover the length of four and a half football pitches in one second an engineer work on a body panel of the @entity1 vehicle which will be able to go from 0 to 1,000mph in 55 seconds during the record attempt , where the team will try to break the current land speed record of 763mph or 1228km/h , the rocket will reach a blistering 3,000 degrees - twice the temperature of inside a volcano the incredible @entity1 car , which is powered by a @entity8 jet engine and a rocket , is being built to be the fastest car in the world			1
once complete , the car will be able to travel from 0m to 1000m in just 55 seconds and can travel faster than a bullet fired from a @entity157 357			1
it will do 150 metres in the blink of an eye and could cover the distance of four and a half football pitches in one second			0
the car is a mix of car and aircraft technology , with the front half being a carbon fibre monocoque like a racing car and the back half being a metallic framework and panels like an aircraft			0
its huge @entity84 jet engine is so powerful it could suck all the air out of an average sized house in three seconds and would blast the car to an altitude of 25,000ft if it was fired straight into the air			0
during the attempt , where the team will try to break the current land speed record of 763mph or 1228km/h , the rocket will reach a blistering 3,000 degrees - twice the temperature of inside a volcano			2
length - 13.470 metres @entity203 - 3 metres wheels diameter - 0.915 metres turning radius - 120 metres @entity205 ( fully fuelled ) - 7786 kg @entity206 - @entity207 hybrid rocket engine - @entity209 design speed - 1,690 km / h ( 1,050 mph ) wheels rpm - 10,000 length of track - 19 km ( 12 miles ) current record - 1,227.99 km / h ( 763.035 mph ) @entity214 - deployed at 800mph parachutes - deployed at 600mph			0

the supersonic @entity1 car is currently being put together at its design centre in @entity18 , @entity19
complete it will do 0m to 1000m in just 55 seconds and travel faster than a bullet fired from a @entity157 357
project director @entity34 is hoping the car will beat the land speed record of 763mph - set by @entity224
