some are , of course , needed for medical reasons			0
however , this is a major surgical procedure for mother and baby that should not be undertaken without serious consideration			0
' there is increasing evidence about the negative implications for women and their babies of having a caesarean section			1
we support @entity129 recommendations on this issue			0

this year 's figures revealed the conception rate for women aged 35 to 39 increased to 64.5 conceptions per thousand women - almost doubling since 1990 , according to the @entity67 figures			1
@entity173 , director of external affairs at @entity175 ( @entity175 ) told @entity176 : ' there are many reasons for this , not least the time it takes to achieve financial stability and establish a career			0
' women are often warned about leaving it too late to start trying for a baby , but this really needs to be kept in perspective			0
' pregnancy and childbirth for older women can present particular challenges , but rather than pressuring women into having children earlier than they feel is right for them , we need to ensure maternity services are in place to deliver the care they need			0
' a spokesman for the @entity200 ( @entity200 ) said while women must be supported in their decisions about when to plan having a child , they ' need to know how fertility and pregnancy outcomes change with age '			0
biologically the optimum childbearing age is between 20 and 35 years old , the @entity200 said			0
but they warn after the age of 35 , ' it is increasingly difficult to fall pregnant , and the change of miscarriage rises '			0
@entity200 spokesman , dr @entity213 , said : ' the growing trend of women delaying motherhood until their late thirties or early forties is , we believe , an inevitable one , because of the increasing equality in the social , professional , financial and corporate environment that we live in			1
' the average age of fatherhood has also been rising			0
' it is the role of healthcare professionals , including the @entity200 and its members , to ensure that all women are made aware of the potential risks of having pregnancies in later life , so that they have an informed choice when doing so			0
' it comes as teenage pregnancy rates for women aged 15 to 17 fell to 24.5 conceptions per thousand of the population - the lowest rate since 1969			1
the growing trend of having children later in life is becoming the norm , as women prioritise their education and careers			1

the @entity67 believed the drop in the number of under - age pregnancies could be explained by several factors , including the improved programmes of sex and relationship education introduced by successive governments			2
the government has included the under 18 teenage conception rate as one of its three sexual health indicators in its @entity294 , and it is one of the national measures of progress on child poverty			0
professor @entity300 , national director of @entity301 at @entity302 ( @entity302 ) , said : ' young people who have the highest rate of unplanned pregnancy and teenage parenthood can be at risk of a range of poor outcomes , such as poor educational achievement , poor physical and mental health , social isolation and poverty , so it is vital this downward trend is continued			0

teenage pregnancy rates and early motherhood is significant , as it is linked to poor educational achievement , poor physical and mental health , social isolation , poverty and related factors , the @entity67 note			0
the @entity67 believed the drop in the number of under - age pregnancies could be explained by several factors , including the improved programmes of sex and relationship education introduced by successive governments			2
its report also stated that it could be due to a ' shift in aspirations of young women towards education ' or the ' perception of stigma associated with being a teenage mother '			1
