a storm that ravaged a @entity3 island 's coastline 5,000 years ago is said to have be responsible for a well - preserved set of ancient footprints			1
archaeologists working on excavations of the @entity8 in @entity9 found evidence of at least two people 's prints , dating back to the @entity13			1
and now experts believe they were left by fishermen attempting to protect nearby river barriers during poor weather			2
using the size of the prints as a guide , experts from @entity19 believe the poor weather threatened the barriers , and the fishermen would have waded into the water to try to protect them			1
as each print was made , sand was pushed into the seabed and became preserved over time ' it is quite surreal to have found human footprints , ' said archaeologist @entity32 in a press release			2
' we normally find historical clues in the form of human waste , but here we have found an entirely different clue and a first in @entity3 archaeology : a physical print left behind by a human			2
' ' we know about animal footprints being found from the past , but human footprints have , as far as i know , never been found in @entity3 @entity13 archaeology			1
' the footprints were found running along a 3.2ft - long ( one metre ) system of fishing weirs used to feed a nearby @entity13 community			1
their close proximity to these barriers , as well as their depth and position , suggest that a storm caused the barriers to flood and become covered in sand			0

' studies have shown that @entity13 people repeatedly repaired and actually moved parts of the system to optimise the coastal flow			2
' we can follow the footsteps and sense the importance of the [ barrier ] system , which has been an important element used to feed coastal populations , ' continued mr @entity32			0
archaeologists made the discovery during excavations of the @entity8 ( marked ) on the @entity3 island of @entity9			1
excavations of the tunnel are continuing and @entity19 said it is hoping the prints will shed further light on the past following further tests excavations of the tunnel are continuing and @entity19 said it is hoping the prints will shed further light on the past , following further tests			1
' with the discovery of footprints from @entity13 people , excavations in @entity112 have suddenly become more personal , ' said the museum			1
' here we are with direct imprints of past human activities that can be attached to a specific incident - a storm that destroyed a barrier , and which had to be repaired to ensure the survival of the population			0
' the earliest footprints left by humans outside @entity126 were found in mud in @entity128 in february			0
described as ' the most important discovery on @entity132 shores ' , the 800,000 - year - old footprints were discovered in @entity133 after being exposed by sea tides			0
scientists believe the footprints are evidence of the earliest known humans in northern @entity139 , previously only revealed through the discovery of animal bones and stone tools			0
the footprint surface was exposed at low tide as heavy seas removed the beach sands to reveal a series of elongated hollows cut into compacted silts			0
of the 50 footprints found , only around twelve were reasonably complete while two showed the toes in detail			0
in some cases the heel , arch and even toes could be identified , equating to modern shoes of up to @entity132 size 8 .			0

archaeologists found the prints during work at the @entity8
the well - preserved footprints are said to date back to the @entity13
experts believe the prints were left by fishermen trying to safeguard their weirs in a storm , 5,000 years ago
judging by the size of the prints , at least two people waded into the water
excavations in the @entity3 region , and tests on the footprints , are *ongoing*
@entity19 is hoping they will shed further light on the past
