last saturday night millions of football fans watched as @entity1 won the @entity2 in one of the most eagerly - awaited fixtures of the sporting calendar			2
but , according to a @entity9 advert shown in @entity10 before the game , none of them were women , as they were all too busy shopping for shoes instead			1
in the ad , the beer brand teamed up with @entity17 to offer a 50 per cent off shoes sale online and in stores , starting at exactly the same time as the game , in order to keep wives and girlfriends of sports fans busy			1
the voice - over adds that the sale will give women ' everything to make her think only about shoes , and especially not about where you are			2
' it ends by saying that you - meaning a man - will be happy with your friends , while your wife will be happy with you			0
the film , which was made by @entity61 , provoked outcries of sexism from female sports fans in @entity10 before it was removed from @entity35			1
that is n't entirely surprising , given that during the @entity68 , the majority of @entity10 viewers were women			2
one user wrote : thank you , @entity9 , for reminding me that my place is just in a store thinking about my appearance and not drinking your beer , which was my favourite , watching sports with my friends , which i thought was fun			0
' the advertising company who came up with the promotion attempted to defend it , saying it ' in no way alludes to male - chauvinism ' ( pictured , @entity88 plays in the @entity2 final on saturday ) saturday 's final between @entity1 and @entity91 saw @entity1 walk away with the title , thanks to an injury - time header from @entity96 and an extra-time goal from @entity99 @entity98 ( pictured ) when challenged by @entity100 , @entity61 said : ' the idea in no way alludes to male - chauvinism			1
it â€™s an idea that plays with the different interests that may exist among couples			0
' we had no intention of reinforcing stereotypes or causing any kind of discomfort or embarrassment			0
' the company added that the advert was meant to generate conversation and was ' entirely good - natured			0
