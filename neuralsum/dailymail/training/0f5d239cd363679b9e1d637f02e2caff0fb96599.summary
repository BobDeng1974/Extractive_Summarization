i never felt that we were out of the game despite their goal , which we should have done better with , ' said @entity0			1
‘ we were missing a couple of players too			2
and with respect , our injury blows would cause more problems than the @entity24 game			0

as a player , he captained @entity84 to victory , home and away , against @entity10 in the 1984 @entity87			1

‘ @entity2 basically had one single chance and in the final second of the game managed to equalise			0
‘ on the other hand if there ’s anyone to blame , the blame has to be on us			2
‘ something like that should n’t have happened in the dying seconds of the game			0
‘ we lost possession too easily , we misplaced passes , we passed too often back to ( @entity121 ) @entity120			0
‘ despite being 1 - 0 up we showed a lot of nervousness in the game , we stopped controlling the game and gave too many chances to the opponents			0
‘ we let them ( @entity2 ) rise again , ’ he stressed			0

we created fewer chances than we did against @entity103 but we did at least score			0

with @entity103 and @entity48 sharing four goals , @entity0 is where he wants to be for his emotive @entity49 reunion on november 14			2
the stakes could n’t he higher but the @entity154 squad have a wet sail at their back , and a manager whom they believe in at the helm .			0
