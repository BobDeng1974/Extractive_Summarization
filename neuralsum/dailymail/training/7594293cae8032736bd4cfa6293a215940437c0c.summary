a man who was sentenced to die yesterday , is now under investigation for five more capital crimes in a different state			0
a @entity5 jury deliberated for seven hours on tuesday , before coming to the decision to send 40 - year - old @entity7 to death row for the january 2008 murder of @entity11 woman @entity10 , 36			1
prosecutors said @entity7 beheaded @entity10 alive , before chopping up the rest of her body and dumping the remains in black bags scattered along interstate roads			1
the remains were recovered by investigators , who also found @entity10 's severed hands hidden in the walls of @entity7 ' @entity22 home			1
on monday , the day before he was sentenced , @entity7 allegedly confessed to murdering five more women in @entity25 before he moved to @entity5 , prosecutor @entity23 said			1
@entity7 is originally from @entity26			2
' and that 's going to also be investigated and may result in charges			0
' both @entity5 and @entity25 have the death penalty , but @entity25 follows through on executing their death row inmate at a higher rate than any other state			1
this year alone , 10 people have been executed by lethal injection in @entity25 compared to just three people in the past two decades in @entity5 , despite the state having one of the largest death row populations			1
more victims : before he was sentenced on tuesday , @entity7 ( right , in 2008 ) allegedly admitted to murdering five other women in @entity25			1
@entity5 victim @entity10 ( left ) who was 36 at the time of her death in 2008 it 's still unclear how these new admissions will impact @entity7 ' death sentence in @entity5 , or which state would handle the execution if @entity7 is convicted of capital crimes in @entity25			1
@entity63 's calls to @entity23 were not immediately returned wednesday morning			0
@entity7 himself showed relatively little emotion as he received the life - ending news on tuesday , but reporters in court said his eyes filled with tears			2
his sisters attended the hearing and started sobbing when they heard the decision			0
@entity76 ' sister and mother defended him in court on monday , pleading the jury to use mercy in deciding the sentence			0
however , the 12 - person jury , which included eight females and four males , eventually decided on the death sentence after determining that @entity7 tortured @entity10 before she died			1
in @entity5 , all capital crimes must include proof of an aggravated circumstance , such as torture			0
in the middle of their deliberations , a jury member was sent back into court to get the legal definition of torture from the judge			0
the decision did not appear to be an easy one for the jury , as two members were seen wiping away tears as the sentence was read			0
@entity7 ' family were n't the only ones to defend his character in court on monday either , a former cell mate and prison guard testified that he should be spared the death penalty			2
@entity110 shared a cell with @entity7 when he was on trial for murder charge he has since been acquitted of			2
thought he was in a ' very dark place ' at the time , @entity7 helped him get through it			0
a former prison guard who now volunteers to teach bible study classes as a @entity119 says several inmates in his group look to @entity7 for wisdom			0
however , those views were countered by a former fianc√©e who said @entity7 became a different person when he started abusing drugs and that he once threatened to kill her			0
@entity7 ' case is far from over since all death penalties are automatically reviewed by the state @entity129 in @entity5 , which can cancel a death sentence			1
@entity7 will formally be sentenced on january 6 .			2

@entity7 , 40 , was sentenced to death on tuesday for the january 2008 murder of 36 - year - old @entity10
