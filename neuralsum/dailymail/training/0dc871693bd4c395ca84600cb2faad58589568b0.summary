by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has suggested his under - privileged upbringing has made him hungrier for this season 's @entity4 than team - mate @entity6			1
@entity2 may now have all the trappings of wealth that come with his celebrity status , but throughout his formative years until the time when he was handed a contract with @entity13 from 2007 that was far from the case			1
@entity2 's surroundings were exceptionally modest , with father @entity16 at one stage holding down three jobs in order to pay for his son to travel the country and pursue his early karting ambitions			2
taking it easy : @entity2 leaves the paddock by boat as the world championship leader prepares for @entity27 as for @entity6 , the son of 1982 world champion @entity28 , he has lived all his years in @entity27 , and so it can be claimed he has known nothing other than the good life			1
@entity6 has even spoken of the times his father walked him to school along roads that form part of the principality 's street circuit , scene of this weekend 's latest showdown			0
to that extent , one @entity41 newspaper recently suggested @entity6 was too soft to go toe - to - toe with @entity2 over the course of a title fight			1
as 2008 world champion , and winning the crown in the manner he did - with an overtaking manoeuvre on the final corner of the last lap of the concluding race of the season - it would suggest @entity54 has the killer instinct and can go the distance			0
' let me tell you this : i come from a not - great place in @entity61 and lived on a couch in my dad 's apartment , ' said @entity2			1
' @entity6 grew up in @entity27 with jets and hotels and boats and all these kind of things , so the hunger is different			2
home from home : @entity6 grew up in @entity27 and used to walk the roads which form the tracks to get to school ' i want to be the hungriest guy in the cockpit from all 22 of us - even if every driver has to believe he 's the hungriest			1
' if i were to come here believing @entity6 is hungrier than me then i might as well go home			1
so i 've got to be the hungriest			0
to win the world championship you need to be the hungriest			0
' @entity2 goes into sunday 's @entity27 with a slender three - point cushion over @entity6 after winning the last four grands prix in which the @entity41 has been runner - up			1
on a rain - affected practice day , @entity2 and @entity6 again led the field , with the @entity89 just 0.032secs ahead of the 28 - year - old			2
that was despite what @entity2 has described as a ' frantic ' start as he has revealed he ' overslept ' , resulting in him being seen jogging to the track minutes prior to the start of @entity95			0
that did not stop @entity2 drawing first blood with @entity6 , who a year ago achieved a clean sweep in finishing top of the times in all three practice sessions and qualifying before winning the race			2
all eyes on me : @entity2 leads the drivers ' standings by three points from @entity6 after four straight wins @entity2 is now eager to claim what would remarkably be his first pole position in eight attempts here , even though he is fourth on the all - time standings with 35 to his name			1
and @entity2 has made no secret of the fact as to how he would like matters to unfold on sunday in a bid to put daylight between himself and @entity6			2
asked by the official website , @entity123 , as to what would be his dream result , @entity2 replied : ' finishing first , @entity121 ( @entity120 ) finishing second and @entity126 ( @entity127 ) finishing third			0
that would be it for me			0
the dream result for the team would be the @entity134 cars finishing one - two , and one of those guys in third			0
come second practice , and after a heavy downpour beforehand , there was virtually no activity for 40 minutes , much to the derision of the fans who made their feelings plain			0
the drivers , however , were not keen to risk an accident , and it was only in the last few minutes the disgruntled spectators saw a full complement of cars on a dry track .			0

@entity2 says his modest upbringing in @entity61 is *vastly* different to the formative years @entity6 spent in @entity27
' if i were to come here believing @entity6 is hungrier than me then i might as well go home . so i 've got to be the hungriest , ' he says
@entity2 heads up the *dirvers* championship , leading @entity6 by three points after four consecutive *victories*
