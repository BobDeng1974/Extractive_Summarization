@entity0 , the country ’s leading anti-discrimination campaigner , has slammed the @entity2 for attempting to sweep the scandal of @entity5 ’s racist comment under the @entity7 carpet			1
the @entity2 announced their case closed against former top referee @entity5 after an internal probe , just as @entity10 revealed the retired @entity12 housemaster had racially abused @entity2 employee @entity13 , a referee coaching manager , during a summit at @entity15			1
@entity5 , 59 , who sits on @entity2 , @entity16 and @entity18 referee committees , has been slapped on the wrist for breaching the @entity21 code of conduct and told to have diversity and equality training			1
’ @entity0 , highly - respected chairman of @entity38 , said : ‘ it beggars belief the way the @entity2 have tried to close this issue down before anyone has even found out about it			2
there is a real problem here in how the @entity2 operates			0
‘ the process should be clear and transparent and it ’s not			0
it beggars belief how the @entity2 believe their campaign to fight racism can ever be trusted or taken seriously if @entity5 is allowed to get away with making a proven racist comment and remain in office			1
' it would show far greater leadership and responsibility if he relinquishes his roles in football , admitting his mistake			0
investigation : the @entity2 said that no official complaint was made about the incident ‘ @entity5 is a highly intelligent man , so what ’s the point of him having training at his age			1
it ’s just a load of nonsense and this is the same @entity2 who took the high moral ground over @entity75 ’s sexism email exchanges at the @entity76			2
' such blatant racism by a senior high - profile figure ca n’t just be conveniently forgotten by the @entity2 , it does n’t add up			0
’ the @entity2 say @entity5 has apologised unreservedly , there was no official complaint and a thorough investigation took place			2
@entity84 , highly - rated at the @entity85 for her stellar presenting role at @entity27 , has been offered a new three - year deal to keep anchoring the corporation ’s flagship sports event and @entity90			1
and @entity84 , who was seen as possibly winding down her broadcasting career when she opted out of co-hosting @entity92 in 2013 , is almost certain to accept the contract because of her love of tennis and the long - running quiz show			0
staying power : @entity84 will be offered a new three year deal to anchor events such as @entity27 @entity84 will be 61 in three years and her longevity is very useful to the @entity85 in fighting multiple claims of ageism against women broadcasters			1
meanwhile , @entity85 tennis producer @entity104 always starts @entity27 by telling his team it ’s up for grabs who commentates on the showcase matches			2
but it ’s becoming very predictable that @entity111 is given the women ’s final and @entity114 gets the men ’s			0
one @entity117 flight on sunday will screen the @entity27 ’s men ’s singles final live as part of a test run			1
flying high : @entity123 's @entity27 final against @entity124 will be broadcast in the air by @entity117 but it ’s unlikely the passions for @entity123 or @entity124 will make the plane wobble , which is what happened on a @entity131 domestic flight when @entity132 scored against @entity133			1
@entity27 , keen to upgrade their champions dinner location from the @entity136 in @entity137 , are moving the end - of - tournament bash to the @entity139			0
the @entity140 has been the traditional venue over the years , but a price could n’t be agreed after its recent refurbishment even by the fabulously wealthy @entity144			0
there have been numerous false dawns at the @entity147 , but there is now genuine confidence that new @entity151 director of player development @entity152 can arrest the long decline			0
decision time : @entity152 will have to find a coach for promising teenager @entity157 ( above ) @entity152 does n’t start work at @entity159 until september , but his analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of @entity164 ’s top 20 players , based on 60 days of assessment and delivered to an @entity147 board meeting this week , impressed all the directors			0
his first task will be to sort out the fiasco of @entity170 being assigned to coach @entity164 ’s highest - ranked teenager , @entity157 , at the player ’s request when the 40 - year - old has too many other commitments to do a proper job .			2

@entity2 have closed the case on @entity180 's racist comment
@entity5 was slapped on the wrist and will have equality training
@entity84 has been offered a new three - year deal at the @entity85
one @entity117 flight will screen the @entity27 ’s men 's singles final live
