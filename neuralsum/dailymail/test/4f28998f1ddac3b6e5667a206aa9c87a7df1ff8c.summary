allegations : veteran peer @entity1 has repeatedly denied claims he abused young boys at care homes and is now not fit to stand trial despite ' credible evidence ' his name and face may not be immediately familiar to everyone today but , in his pomp , @entity1 was one of the most prominent @entity12 politicians and campaigners of his time			1
his entry in @entity16 occupies nearly 50 lines : @entity19 for @entity20 ( 1970 - 97 ) … distinguished barrister … author … broadcaster … former president of the @entity24			0
after training at the @entity25 and @entity26 , he qualified as a barrister in 1954 and was appointed a @entity28 in 1971			0
he has fought tirelessly for the return of @entity31 assets held in @entity33 banks by the @entity34 , and was made a life peer on his retirement from the @entity37 in recognition of his achievements in public life			2
those are the bare facts of @entity1 ’s gilded career			1
for nearly 25 years , however , a shadow has hung over @entity1 of @entity44 in the same way it did @entity47 and a string of other establishment figures			1
we now know , from victims who have come forward following his death – too many for the allegations not to be true – that late @entity54 mp @entity47 was a serial paedophile			2
but was @entity1 ? detectives have interviewed more than 20 men who claim they were abused by @entity1 in their youth			1
it is suspected he used his hobby as a magician – @entity1 is a member of the @entity61 – to get close to them and gain their trust when he visited children ’s homes in @entity67 between 1969 and 1988			1
but the evidence will never be tested in court after @entity70 , director of public prosecutions , ruled that it was not in the public interest to put the @entity12 peer on trial because of his age and ill health			1
@entity1 , 86 , is a father of three			1
his youngest daughter , @entity78 , 51 , is an ordained rabbi and serves as senior rabbi at the @entity80			0
his son @entity81 is a prominent @entity28			0
@entity1 ’s wife @entity82 died in 1996 and he has not been seen outside his flat in @entity84 , north - west @entity85 , since police investigating the claims of historic sexual abuse raided it in 2013			1
shortly afterwards , reports emerged that he was suffering from advanced dementia			0
in the month before the raid , @entity1 attended the @entity93 15 times , claiming £ 2,100 in daily allowances , which has inevitably cast a critical spotlight on the decision to not prosecute him			1
@entity1 , it should be stressed , strongly denied the allegations against him – including claims of rape – when they surfaced nearly 25 years ago at the trial of @entity104 , a care - home warden suspected of abusing scores of children in his care			1
@entity104 , a former @entity108 councillor , was given five life sentences			0
yet , the 1991 case made sensational headlines for very different reasons			2
one of those headlines can be found in a faded newspaper cutting			0
it reads : ‘ my commons date and night with mp @entity1			1
’ the witness in question was @entity119 , then aged 30 , who lived at one of @entity104 ’s care homes in @entity1 ’s constituency			1
mr @entity119 claimed under oath that @entity1 had abused him repeatedly between the ages of 13 and 15			1
the jury were shown letters the mp is said to have sent to him on @entity148 notepaper			2
some were reportedly signed ‘ love @entity1 ’			1
they are now in the hands of the police			0
one was alleged to have been penned by @entity1 after they had stayed together at his home			1
‘ it feels strange not to have you flipping around me like a friendly flea ! , ’ the letter said			0
‘ in fact – i miss you			0
’ referring to an encounter in the swimming pool of the @entity141 , mr @entity119 said : ‘ i was fondled in my private area			0
it seemed at first like a bit of fun , being thrown around the water , but he would hold me close			0
’ @entity104 used the testimony as part of his defence : that he was being prosecuted to divert attention from @entity1 and other high - profile ( unnamed ) paedophiles and that he was trying to shield the boys under his charge from them			1
@entity119 was not the only witness to implicate @entity1			1
two others were called for the prosecution , saying @entity104 had raped them , but in cross-examination , they appeared to confirm some details of mr @entity119 ’s story			2
probes : @entity1 , left in 1974 , served as an mp for decades and was investigated in 1991 , 2002 and 2007			1
@entity1 was mentioned during the trial of paediophile @entity104 , right , who died in jail one , a woman , said she heard an argument between @entity104 and mr @entity119 in which he [ @entity104 ] was shouting that he was n’t [ allowed ] to see @entity1 any more			2
’ the other , a man , said mr @entity119 had boasted about ‘ having friends in high places ’			0
were the allegations made simply to muddy the waters ? the jury thought so , finding @entity104 , who died in prison in 1994 , guilty of the majority of charges against him			0
days later , @entity1 , then in his 60s , broke his silence on the affair by making a personal statement to @entity202			2
under parliamentary rules , personal statements are not debatable , so there were no follow - up questions from @entity19			0
@entity1 told them : ‘ there was , of course , not a shred of truth in any of the allegations of criminal conduct against me during the trial			2
‘ meanwhile , as my wife , my family and i have had a taste of the suffering which @entity104 can impose on innocent people , will you join me in sending the real sufferers , the individuals who endured his homes and whose lives have been wrecked at his hands , the profound sympathy of us all ? ’ his statement was greeted with cheers			0
fellow @entity12 mp @entity231 described @entity1 as a ‘ brave man ’ and others passed on leader @entity235 ’s ‘ tremendous support ’			1
police interviewed @entity1 and mr @entity119 , but no charges were ever brought against the mp			1
one of the detectives who worked on the @entity104 case was @entity240 , who is now chief constable of @entity241			0
last year he made a sensational claim in the @entity243			0
he said there was ‘ credible evidence ’ against @entity1 and that he and his colleagues wanted to make an arrest but were prevented by ‘ more senior people ’ from doing so			1
to put it bluntly , the investigation was blocked			0
influential : @entity1 was chair of the @entity250 and vice-president of the @entity252 mr @entity240 said : ‘ the decision was a clear one : he [ @entity1 ] will be interviewed by appointment and there wo n’t be a search of his home address or his constituency office , of his office in the @entity148			1
it was a decision made by people more senior than me			2
’ the allegations against @entity1 remained buried in newspaper archives until the authorities began re-opening historic child abuse cases in the wake of the @entity268 affair			2
many revolve around the @entity269 , a gay sauna in @entity271 , west @entity85 , where boys are believed to have been abused by a string of powerful men in the 1970s and 1980s , including @entity47			1
one of the people who contacted the police was @entity119			0
at the same time , two booklets from the archives of former mp @entity279 – who died in 2000 – emerged			2
one , a four - page leaflet entitled @entity1 fails to answer ‘ sex with boy ’ evidence and published by a group calling itself @entity283 , landed on the prominent @entity12 backbencher ’s desk in 1992			1
the second , a 24 - page booklet entitled @entity28 , mp , @entity289 ? , arrived in 1995			2
both booklets appear to have been printed professionally and sent anonymously to mr @entity279 ( and presumably to several other influential figures ) by individuals anxious to ensure further attention was paid to the 1991 trial			2
while @entity1 ’s health has made the prospect of prosecution impossible , the stench of an establishment cover - up will continue to surround this deeply troubling case the 1995 booklet provides a detailed account of an alleged victim ’s testimony			1
it tells how the boy spoke of meeting @entity1 in the commons when he was 13			1
he said was invited to @entity1 ’s home when his wife was away			2
‘ we ended up in his bed together and he cuddled me			0
we cuddled and fondled together			0
i did n’t like it and told him to stop			0
’ so began a two - year sexual relationship , the boy claimed			0
the booklet also says that the boy ‘ had been able to provide the police with information about @entity1 ’s home , hotel rooms , life , habits and person in ... infinite and verifiable detail ’			2
the 1992 leaflet also refers to an alleged victim ’s ‘ detailed ’ evidence : ‘ such evidence , submitted under oath ... requires a specific and detailed refutation			0
’ crown prosecution lawyers have spent nine months studying volumes of evidence gathered by @entity67 police against @entity1			1
this week officers visited mr @entity119 , now in his mid- 50s and living on the outskirts of @entity337 , and other alleged victims in person to inform them of the decision not to proceed with the case			0
it has raised further questions about the @entity344 in the face of growing criticism of the conduct of @entity348 against tabloid journalists			0
this is the fourth time that @entity1 has escaped prosecution			1
he was interviewed by police after the @entity104 trial , and was the subject of further allegations of abuse in 2002 , but these were not referred to the @entity344			0
a third investigation was launched in 2006 after police received a complaint from yet another alleged victim			0
a dossier was passed to the cps which decided there was ‘ insufficient evidence ’ to bring charges			0
inevitably , while @entity1 ’s health has made the prospect of prosecution impossible , the stench of an establishment cover - up will continue to surround this deeply troubling case .			1

@entity1 will not face prosecution despite facing credible evidence
director of public prosecutions says decision comes with ' deep regret '
@entity70 tells of *botched* investigations in 1991 , 2002 and 2007
former @entity12 mp allegedly preyed on boys in 1960s , 1970s and 1980s
