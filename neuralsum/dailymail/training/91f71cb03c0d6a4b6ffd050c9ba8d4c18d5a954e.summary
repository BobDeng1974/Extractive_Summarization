@entity1 officials have been forced to remove ' terribly wrong ' guidance for disabled people which suggested that suspects had to prove their innocence when accused of a crime			1
a leading @entity8 condemned the error saying it went against a ' fundamental ' cornerstone of @entity12 law which placed the burden of proof on the prosecution			1
the simplified guide , which was aimed at those with learning difficulties and a limited grasp of @entity20 , used illustrations and text to help people understand the court process			2
the simplified guide used illustrations and text to help people understand the court process the presumption of innocence is a right with origins that can be traced back to the @entity32 it said : ' if you say you did not do a crime , you may have to go back to the @entity36 on a different day , to show the court you did not do the crime			1
this is called a trial			0
' @entity41 , who highlighted the error on @entity43 , said : ' what on @entity45 ? has the @entity1 changed the law on the burden of proof anyone noticing ? ' he told @entity50 : ' they 've got it so terribly wrong here ... it 's the most fundamental thing that the burden of proof will always be on the prosecution and if you 're producing an easy - read guide to these proceedings , the last thing you want to do is misrepresent something as basic as that			1
@entity41 highlighted the error on @entity43 and said : ' has the @entity1 changed the law on the burden of proof anyone noticing ? ' ' while i 'm delighted that anyone wants to produce easy reads to difficult subjects including going to court , the basic principle has to be that they get the law right			1
' the presumption of innocence is a right with origins that can be traced back to the @entity32 , which has its 800th anniversary this year			1
experts said the @entity1 document must have been produced by people with no legal experience and then published before it was checked			0
legal blogger @entity82 said : ' what makes this particularly worrying is that it is in an official document – supposed to be authoritative and reliable – aimed at people with learning difficulties facing trials for serious crimes ( the @entity36 is for serious crimes and its trials are with juries , the magistrates ' courts do not have juries and are for less serious crimes )			0
' what has probably happened is that the copywriter had no legal qualifications or experience			0
and the @entity100 was then published without anyone with legal qualifications or experience at the @entity1 bothering to check that the @entity100 was accurate – that is , before publishing it for people with learning difficulties to rely on when they are accused of serious crimes			2
' the @entity1 is not in a good state internally ; but telling people with learning difficulties that they are guilty if accused of serious crimes unless they can prove they are innocent is surely a low - point			2
' a @entity1 spokesman said : ' easy read guides are an important way of providing information to people in simple and straightforward language			0
it is crucial to ensure these documents are precise and as helpful as possible			0
' we are reviewing this guide and will remove it from our website while this process takes place			0
