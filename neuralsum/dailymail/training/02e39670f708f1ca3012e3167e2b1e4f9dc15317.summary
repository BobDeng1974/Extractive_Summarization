by @entity0 @entity1 claimed a second half hat - trick as @entity3 ensured their place in the @entity7 play - offs with a 32 - 12 victory at @entity9 in a match which marked the end of top - flight rugby at @entity13			1
the @entity14 , needing just a point to move out of reach of pre-match rivals @entity18 and @entity19 , outscored the @entity9 seven tries to two with winger @entity21 adding two more touchdowns and both @entity23 and @entity24 notching one apiece			2
the success came after they rallied from 12 - 8 down at half - time and means @entity3 will now contest play - off rugby for the first time			1
hat - trick : @entity1 is congratulated after scoring three tries against @entity9 @entity9 , looking to go out on a high in their last home match before being relegated to the @entity34 , waved goodbye to the retiring @entity36			1
yet the former @entity38 hooker could not feature in the game through injury , while @entity42 fullback @entity41 was among the other @entity9 favourites who are leaving for pastures new			0
looking to the future , @entity9 handed a debut to 19 - year old academy product @entity48 at centre			2
the @entity14 welcomed back @entity42 @entity51 after several weeks out with a sternum injury			0
after boyhood @entity9 fan and former @entity55 runner - up @entity53 had performed for the crowd , and @entity36 had been introduced on the pitch with his family , @entity3 capitalised on a handling error by the home side to open the scoring within two minutes			1
the @entity9 were caught short on their left side and a long missed pass from @entity64 put @entity21 over near the corner flag , although @entity64 failed to add the extras from the touchline			0
play - off : after beating @entity9 , @entity3 have secured their place in the @entity7 play - offs @entity21 was in again after eight minutes when confusion , following a misplaced high bomb from @entity72 , allowed the ball back into @entity3 hands off a @entity9 player and the winger once more had a clear run to the corner			1
@entity64 again swung the conversion wide and the @entity9 hit back just three minutes later with momentum carrying @entity80 through an attempted tackle and over the whitewash			0
@entity83 converted to take his career tally above the 500 - point mark prior to his end - of - season departure for @entity87			0
@entity88 went off temporarily after a quarter of an hour to be replaced by @entity89 , who will remain in @entity7 with @entity18 next season , but the absence of their halfback would not break the @entity9 ' momentum as the @entity14 were forced to drop out under their own posts on three occasions			1
@entity97 was held up trying to touch down before the pressure eventually told and @entity99 powered his way through a ruck of players to edge the home side in front , @entity83 again bisecting the uprights			0
@entity48 almost savoured a dream start to his senior career when claiming a @entity109 cross-kick and racing 60 metres upfield before being caught and seeing his pass go to ground			0
then , 12 minutes into the second half , @entity48 dream turned to a nightmare as he was controversially adjudged to have knocked on a grubber kick			0
it appeared the ball had moved backwards , and @entity3 immediately capitalised to score through @entity1			1
@entity64 , having missed twice , this time struck the post with the ball bouncing out to leave the scores level at 12 - 12			2
it hardly mattered as barely three minutes later @entity1 struck again in almost the same place to put the @entity14 back in front yet , amazingly , @entity64 then hit the other upright			2
@entity1 completed his hat - trick from a @entity72 pass with 11 minutes to go , although it came as little surprise and to ironic cheers when @entity64 kept his unwanted 100 per cent record by missing his fifth straight conversion			1
to rub salt in @entity9 's wounds , former @entity9 winger @entity23 grabbed a late sixth try and @entity24 a seventh for @entity3			2
with @entity64 now off the pitch , @entity136 converted each to leave a slightly unreflective final score .			0

@entity3 beat @entity9 32 - 12
*vikings* secure place in @entity7 play - offs
