@entity0 today admitted the race for @entity2 is ' neck and neck ' as he launched @entity6 's election campaign at the olympic park			1
the @entity6 leader used a speech at the top of the @entity11 overlooking the @entity13 stadium to urge a ' spirit of optimism ' and a belief that ' @entity17 can do better ' he signalled once again that the @entity18 will be at the heart of his bid for power , announcing a new cap on the profits private firms can make from the health service			1
polls suggested @entity38 secured a narrow victory over his rival , but @entity6 strategists believe it exposed the prime minister 's refusal to go head - to - head in a debate			1
mr @entity0 sought to counter claims his leadership has been too negative , vowing : @entity17 can do better than this '			2
he told activists gathered at the top of the 114metre sculpture at the heart of the @entity53 : ' as we go out to fight this election , just remember : ' they 're the pessimists			0
i know this election is going to be tough			0
' like so many races here during the @entity61 , it may come down to the wire			0
' i know our opponents will throw everything they have our way			0
' but he insisted that @entity6 has ' a better plan , a better future '			1
introducing mr @entity0 , deputy leader @entity70 said he had ' put us within touching distance of winning this general election '			0
mr @entity0 laid out his pitch for power the morning after his mauling at the hands of @entity34 in the first tv contest of the campaign mr @entity0 announced a @entity6 government would act to ensure health services are no longer ' threatened ' by privatisation mr @entity0 announced a @entity6 government would act to ensure health services are no longer ' threatened ' by privatisation			1
but he was forced to defend himself against claims that he was scaremongering by referring to ' privatisation ' when no patients are expected to pay for their treatment up front			1
under @entity6 's plans , a new profit cap - usually 5 per cent - would be set on outsourced healthcare contracts worth over £ 500,000 , private companies would be blocked from ' cherry - picking ' lucrative treatments and the @entity18 would become the ' preferred provider ' for all services			1
mr @entity0 said of the profit cap : ' we do think it 's right to say , when private sector companies are involved , we do n't get excess profits which is draining money away from the @entity102			2
' look , i think this is going to be common - sense thing that people will think is the right thing to do			0
i hope other parties adopt this because it 's the right thing to do for the future of our nhs			0
' mr @entity0 set off on his campaign battlebus , urging supporters to be ' optimistic ' for the future senior shadow minister @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity70 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 posed with mr @entity0 outside the bus on people paying for private healthcare , he added : ' what is the real lesson of the past on this - the lesson before 1997 and a lesson i fear for the future if @entity38 were to get back in ? ' it 's that people end up having the option of either waiting for an unacceptably long time or having to go private - that that becomes the offer on the table for people			0
' so i think there is a real fear that that becomes the option for people and you do n't have a health service that is properly serving people so there 's a big choice at this election and a big choice about the health service on the ballot paper			0
' @entity151 health secretary @entity150 said : ‘ if you bankrupt the economy like @entity6 did last time – then you ’ll put our @entity18 at risk			1
we can only have a strong @entity18 if we have a strong economy , but @entity0 does n’t have an economic plan			2
‘ we all know @entity6 want to ‘ weaponise ’ the @entity18 but this is another policy from @entity0 that looks ill - thought through			1
it risks higher infection rates , higher waiting times and chaos for our @entity18			2
this incompetence is exactly why @entity0 is simply not up to the job			0

@entity6 leader tries to *recreate* the ' spirit of optimism ' of @entity13
puts the @entity18 at heart of his bid for power with new cap on profits
but he is forced to defence claims he is scaremongering on privatisation
