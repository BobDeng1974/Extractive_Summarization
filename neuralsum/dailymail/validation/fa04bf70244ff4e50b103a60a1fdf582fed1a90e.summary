he is passionate about conservation and was in @entity3 's @entity2 to highlight the plight of the region 's wild elephants and to call for an end to the ivory trade			1
but as prince @entity10 was feeding treats to rescue elephant @entity12 , just a few miles away , other animals were living in conditions that campaigners describe as ' dingy ' and with their legs encased in chains			1
@entity19 having their trunks sat upon by visitors by a @entity24 camera crew , the elephants are displayed in twice - daily shows at the the @entity26			2
later , he did speak about the plight of @entity3 's elephants , although he once again steered clear of discussing the circus , which is on the same site as the sanctuary he was visiting			1
' it is appalling that elephants and many others may be extinct in the wild in our lifetimes , and we seem to be hurtling towards the tragic outcome , ' he said			0
' the extinction of animals such as elephants , rhinos and pangolins would be an immeasurable loss to the whole of humanity			0
' but his efforts risk being overshadowed by the controversy over the visit , with @entity61 saying they were aware of the existence of the circus beforehand			0
performance : the elephants were filmed being made to perform circus tricks for crowds of tourists chained : campaigners say the elephants live in dingy pens between performances there , say campaigners , the wretched performing elephants , many of which have had their tusks filed down , are trained to give rides and kick footballs around an arena			1
some are even trained to dance to disco music and form a pyramid during shows that take place four times a day			0
between their ‘ performances ’ they are chained by their legs in dingy pens			1
@entity61 , however , said that while it was aware of the issues , the focus of the visit was for prince @entity10 to learn more about the region ’s conservation efforts and engage with the positive work being done			1
the nature reserve says its elephants are from @entity98 and not from the local wild population			0
@entity100 , chief executive of the @entity101 of which @entity10 is patron , defended the prince 's decision to visit the park			2
' different cultures have different ways of doing things , of course it 's not the way we do things , ' he said			0
' but you know i think today was very much about highlighting the illegal wildlife trade - this trip for him in terms of conservation has been about watching , listening , learning about the challenges faced by conservationists here in @entity3			2
' dressed up : the animals are also made to wear bizarre versions of human clothing such as glasses exposed : the performance was filmed by a camera crew from @entity24 aware : @entity61 said they knew of the circus before the visit took place the prince , who began the day at the @entity133 , had been hopeful of seeing some of the animals in their natural habit - the last tropical rainforest in @entity3 which hosts some 250 wild @entity139 elephants - 90 per cent of its wild elephant population			1
apparently unbothered by the @entity143 heat , the prince climbed 200 or steps up to a wooden viewing platform			0
sadly for @entity10 , there were none to be seen , although it was a different story when he arrived at the sanctuary to meet @entity12			1
' you 're going to get indigestion ' , smiled the prince as he fed the elephant handful after handful of carrots - much to both her and his delight			2
the visit was designed to highlight the prince 's conservation work - and raise awareness of the need to end the illegal trade in ivory			1
a royal source has said that during @entity10 's talks with @entity3 's president @entity167 earlier this week wildlife protection and the illegal trade in ivory were raised and that he was pleased by @entity3 leader ’s pledges to clamp down on the industry			1
criticism : his visit was overshadowed by controversy about a nearby elephant circus saved : @entity12 was discovered in a river in 2005 with terrible injuries caused by a poacher 's trap performing : according to campaigners , other elephants nearby live in chains and are made to perform tricks in a speech before he flew back to @entity183 , @entity10 described the greatest threat to elephants worldwide today as the ‘ ruthless and organised poaching and trafficking ’ industry			1
he said : ' it is appalling that elephants – and many others – may be extinct in the wild in our lifetimes , and that we seem to be hurtling towards that tragic outcome			0
' the illegal wildlife trade is therefore our common enemy			2
it is a vicious form of criminality : plundering the natural resources of poorer countries , taking lives , hindering development and spreading corruption			0
it erodes the rule of law , fuels conflict , and may even fund terrorism			0
' traffickers think nothing of violating laws and sovereignty anywhere they can to exploit a loophole or turn a profit			0
and international cooperation is our strongest defence against them			0
' ' i think what we 've just heard is a really powerful speech appealing to the @entity3 people following on from a very constructive meeting that i gather he had with the president on this issue , ' added mr @entity100 afterwards			2
' just think about it , in the last four months he has raised this issue not only with the president of @entity3 but the president of @entity231 - i do n't know anybody else who has managed to do that in years			0
' aware : @entity61 said they were aware of the proximity of the circus before the trip not talking : the prince did not take questions on the circus but later emphasised the need for conservation ivory : @entity3 's elephants have been decimated by the ivory trade - something @entity10 hopes to change getting the locals on side : he also met local villagers , who sometimes come into conflict with elephants			1
