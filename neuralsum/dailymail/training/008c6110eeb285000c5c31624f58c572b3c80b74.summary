by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 21:33 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 06:49 est , 9 may 2013 @entity2 today tore into coalition plans to allow nurseries to look after more children , warning it will have no impact on cutting costs for parents			1
he said any adult would struggle to care for six two - year - olds at once , as he lifted the lid on a long - running government row about the risks to child safety			1
@entity17 minister @entity16 launched a strong defence of her plans in the @entity20 , but @entity21 said the chaotic policy put child safety at risk			1
deputy prime minister @entity2 could block flagship @entity17 childcare reforms the deputy prime minister has horrified @entity17 colleagues by threatening to block flagship government reforms of childcare just weeks before they are due to be implemented			1
mr @entity2 said parents groups , experts and childcare providers had warned the reforms - championed by @entity17 education minister @entity16 - would not work in an official consultation			1
he said : ' a lot of people basically got back in the consultation and said this is n't going to work , particularly for very small children , it is n't necessarily going to be passed on in terms of cost savings to parents			1
' miss @entity16 has designed radical reform of the system to improve the quality of staff , while reducing costs by lowering the stipulated adult / child ratios			1
she wants to raise the qualifications required of nursery staff and , in return , allow the establishments to increase ratios – for instance four rather than three under - two - year - olds per adult , and six toddlers rather than four			1
childminders will be able to have two babies in their care rather than one and four under - fives rather than three			2
but mr @entity2 said on his weekly radio phone - in : ' having six under - twos instead of four is quite a challenge for the adult			2
' i think four is already quite a handful , just imagine if they go up to six			0
this is not a great ideological thing , this is just about getting it right for parents up and down the country , ' he told @entity73			0
' when the last government changed the so - called ratios and allowed an adult to look after more young children , they did it for three and four - year - olds , it had almost no effect in reducing the cost for parents whatsoever			2
' so you do need to be led by the evidence and that is what i will continue to do in the debate			2
" ' in a nutshell this debate is about : can you raise quality and quantity at the same time			2
we have got to get the balance right			0
we owe it to parents who want quality childcare			0
' he said the behind - the - scenes row had been going on ' for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks '			1
and he told @entity73 host @entity100 : ' i will challenge you to spend a morning looking after six two - year - olds - i think you will find it quite a challenge			0
' ratio reform : education minister @entity16 has championed changes to the number of children nurseries can look after @entity17 ministers want to relax the rules on carer - to - child ratios , to bring them more in line with other @entity117 countries mr @entity2 insisted the row will not affected the rest of the government 's wide - ranging childcare package which also includes £ 1,200 tax breaks on childcare for working parents			1
in the @entity20 today , miss @entity16 insisted the reforms would help to cut costs for parents while allowing childcare staff to be paid more			1
' the current system of childcare is not working for parents , ' she told mps			0
' too many parents in the @entity134 are struggling to juggle their work and childcare arrangements			0
families in @entity138 pay some of the highest costs in the world - 27 per cent of their income goes on costs , compared to 11 % in countries like @entity144			0
' she said that in @entity148 and @entity149 , the ratio for two - year - olds was six to one , in @entity144 each member of staff could look after eight youngsters , while in @entity153 and in @entity154 there were '' no national staff ratios at all '			0
shadow education secretary @entity157 said ratios should not be relaxed because it will not cut costs ' our proposals will allow nurseries who hire high - quality staff to able to exercise professional judgment			1
it is exactly the same concept that we have used in academies , giving high - quality institutions the autonomy to make decisions for themselves and to be able to exercise professional judgment			0
' these ratios are not compulsory			0
this is about professionals in the childcare sector being able to exercise their judgment and being able to deliver an affordable , high - quality service to parents			0
' but @entity21 's shadow education secretary @entity157 said the row was proof of a government in chaos			1
writing for @entity185 he said : ' all this gives the impression of a government that runs on the basis of chaos and confusion			2
this creates real fear amongst parents who need some reassurance on the quality and affordability of childcare			0
' the truth is this is a government with no plan to help hard working families with the costs of childcare , which have spiralled under this government			0
' it ’s not just the experts of course , as any parent will tell you , young children are demanding and they need lots of attention , so while a childminder can have the very best qualifications , they still only have one pair of hands			2
' @entity21 have been campaigning on this issue for months , warning that the changes would risk the quality of care and even child safety			1
' in january miss @entity16 unveiled a major overhaul of the rules on who can look after children , the qualifications they need and the ratios of staff to children with the aim of having fewer , better - qualified staff			1
but government advisor , professor @entity233 , said : ' the figures she gives seem to me to be rather grotesque			0
' professor @entity233 , an expert in early childhood , co-wrote a report for the government on the reforms with professor @entity241 last year			2
however , a leaked copy revealed it warned allowing childminders and nursery workers to care for more children would lead to a ' deterioration ' of the quality of care			1
in an interview with the @entity250 last month , miss @entity16 said too many childcare settings were ‘ chaotic ’ with children ‘ running around ’ and ‘ no sense of purpose ’			1
a spokesman said : ' @entity2 remains to be persuaded that this is the right thing to do for very young children ' but in government meetings over recent days , mr @entity2 has made clear he can no longer support the reforms of ratios			1
‘ the question that needs to be answered is will this drive down costs , ’ said a @entity262 source			0
‘ if it does n’t then that defeats the object of doing it			0
’ another @entity270 source said the @entity262 appeared to have been ‘ spooked ’ by the negative reaction of some childcare providers			0
the prime minister will now have to begin ‘ horse - trading ’ with the @entity262			1
a spokesman for the deputy prime minister said : ‘ the delivery of good quality , affordable childcare is one of @entity2 ’s biggest priorities			1
@entity2 remains to be persuaded that this is the right thing to do for very young children			2
‘ or , crucially , to be persuaded that this would actually help families with high childcare costs			0
’ in one survey , conducted by the @entity287 , out of 341 staff interviewed , 95 per cent said they were concerned about the policy			2
‘ the government ’s own adviser on childcare , professor @entity291 , said the ratio plans ‘ make no sense at all ’			0
@entity296 , chief executive of the @entity297 , said : ' thousands of parents and practitioners , as well as some of the country 's leading early years academics , are against these changes , which will lower the overall quality of childcare in this country			0
' we trust the deputy prime minister will listen to what parents and the sector have to say about these proposals , which we believe are a huge mistake			1
' the @entity314 refused to comment .			0
