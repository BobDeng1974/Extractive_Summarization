scientists are virtually certain that @entity1 will be rocked by a strong earthquake in the next 30 years			2
now they say the risk of a mega-quake is more likely than previously thought			0
the chance of a magnitude - 8 quake striking the state in the next three decades jumped to 7 per cent from 4.7 per cent , mainly because scientists took into account the possibility that several faults can shake at once , releasing seismic energy that results in greater destruction			1
while the risk of a mega-quake is higher than past estimates , it 's more likely - greater than 99 per cent chance - that @entity1 will be rattled by a magnitude - 6.7 jolt similar in size to the 1994 @entity22 disaster			1
brace : a new @entity25 report has increased the likelihood of a magnitude - 8 earthquake hitting @entity1 over the next 30 years			1
above , a photo of an overpass that collapsed in the 1994 magnitude - 6.7 @entity22 earthquake the chance of a @entity22 - size quake was slightly higher in @entity1 than @entity33 - 95 per cent versus 93 per cent , according to a report released tuesday by the @entity25			1
' @entity1 is earthquake country , and residents should live every day like it could be the day of a big one , ' @entity25 geophysicist and lead author @entity35 said			1
the latest seismic calculations largely mirror previous findings issued by the @entity25 in 2008			2
back then , scientists also determined that @entity1 faced an almost certain risk of experiencing a @entity22 - size quake			2
the new report included newly discovered fault zones and the possibility that a quake can jump from fault to fault			2
because of this knowledge , the odds of a catastrophic quake - magnitude 8 or larger - in the next 30 years increased			1
there is a 93 per cent chance of a magnitude 7 or larger occurring over the same period and a 48 per cent chance of a magnitude 7.5 - similar to previous estimates			1
thousands of quakes every year hit @entity1 , sandwiched between two of @entity61 's major tectonic plates , the @entity62 and @entity64 plates			0
most are too small to be felt			0
of the more than 300 faults that crisscross the state , the southern segment of the @entity66 - which runs from central @entity1 to the @entity67 near the @entity70 - @entity69 border - remains the greatest threat because it has n't ruptured in more than three centuries			0
the report found there is a 19 per cent chance in the next 30 years that a @entity22 - size quake will unzip the southern section compared to a 6.4 per cent chance for the northern section , partly because it last broke in 1906			1
the southern @entity66 is ' ready to have an earthquake because it 's really locked and loaded , ' @entity35 said			0
the report is a forecast , but it is not a prediction			0
experts still can not predict exactly where or when a quake will hit anywhere in the world			0
in recent years , the @entity25 and several universities have been testing an early warning system designed to detect the first waves of a jolt and send out an alert before the slower - moving damaging waves			2
proponents have said a few seconds of notice can allow trains to slow down , utilities to shut off gas lines and people to duck for cover			0
the public alert system - still in pilot phrase - needs more funding before it can be rolled out statewide .			0

new @entity25 report increases chances of magnitude - 8 earthquake in next three decades to 7 per cent , up from 4.7 per cent
