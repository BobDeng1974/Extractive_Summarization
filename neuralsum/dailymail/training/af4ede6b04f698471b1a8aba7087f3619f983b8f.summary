by @entity0 published : 12:58 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 17:52 est , 24 october 2013 august and @entity1 are two lucky cats , with quite a tale to tell			1
back in august , the kittens brought the subway in @entity6 to a standstill for several hours after they wandered onto the tracks - causing delays for commuters and even sparking a mayoral debate			1
now , the cheeky duo have been adopted by a couple who live in the borough			2
@entity15 , 33 , and his wife @entity16 , 30 , were among the hundreds of people who wanted to adopt the now 11 - week - old felines			0
they are seen above at the pair 's apartment in @entity28 gim me shelter : after their drama , the cats were treated at the @entity32 in @entity33 ( where they are pictured , above ) the kittens now live with @entity15 , 33 , and his wife @entity16 , 30 , who were among the hundreds of people who wanted to adopt the 11 - week - old felines ' we do n't really know what made us stand out , since the application did n't exactly have an essay question , ' they told the @entity44			1
the couple , who live in a @entity28 apartment , added : ' maybe our desire to help rescue animals came through in the few words we were allotted to describe our interest in these guys			0
' that and the fact that we 've each been cat owners in the past , live in a relatively quiet place , and do n't have kids or other pets			0
' @entity16 , who works for a theatre consulting firm , and @entity15 also said they would be voting for mayoral hopeful @entity60 - and not @entity61 , who himself played an indirect role in the furry saga			0
the two kittens were caught between the rails on subway tracks in the @entity6 borough of @entity33 at the end of the august the pair caused an outage on the @entity72 lines which lasted several hours @entity74 : @entity33 @entity75 mayoral candidate @entity61 said that he would not have shut off subway service to rescue the kittens @entity61 , the former chairman of the @entity78 , said he would n’t have stopped the subway as the kittens scrambled along the tracks			1
a spokesman for @entity61 told the @entity83 at the time that the candidate did not think stopping service for wayward cats was appropriate			1
he said @entity61 believed it should be the @entity78 ’s call whether to shut down the line			2
passengers on the lines were stranded while police officers chased the cats down the tracks back on august 29 , power was cut on @entity72 lines in @entity6 for more than an hour as the two lost kittens scurried around the tracks			1
they were finally rescued about seven hours later and were treated at an animal shelter			0
@entity61 ’s rivals in the mayoral race , among them @entity103 , told the paper they would ’ve stopped trains to save the pets			1
a spokesperson for the disgraced former congressman went even further , saying that the candidate would have risked his own life to rescue the helpless critters			0
' if @entity103 is elected mayor , he will not only stop trains for kittens , he will personally crawl over the third rail to do it , ' @entity112 told the @entity83			1
entertained : while most commuters were furious at the delays , the two kittens kept small children amused at various train stations campaigning outside a subway stop friday , mr @entity103 jokingly told the @entity123 that if elected mayor , he would put in place a comprehensive subway kitten rescue policy			1
other candidates also stated their position on the issue of whether or not to stop the trains for the kitties			0
@entity132 came out on the side of the furry felines , as did @entity136 's campaign			1
the aptly named @entity137 deferred to the @entity78 or police , but noted that he is an animal lover who once owned a beloved feline named @entity140			0
for former city councilman @entity142 , it was a no - brainer			0
‘ what are we , nuts ? of course i would ’ve stopped , ’ he said			0
‘ this almost never happens , but when it does , we ca n’t just go running over kittens			0
’ cat calls : both @entity103 ( left ) and @entity132 said they would have shut off power in the subway to rescue the kitties			1
@entity103 went so far as to say he would have personally saved them with a name like that : @entity137 said he would have deferred to the @entity78 or police , but noted that he is an animal lover who once had a cat while the mayoral hopefuls were opining on the fate of the kittens , august and @entity1 were recuperating at an @entity162 in the @entity33 section of @entity6			1
the then 8 - week - old pets were kept together as they are underwent physical and behavioral tests			0
august and @entity1 , who each weighed around 2lb at the time of rescue , were vaccinated and transferred to a foster home			1
when the two tiny felines were spotted frolicking on the train tracks near the @entity173 station in @entity6 about 11am , @entity78 workers turned off the power			2
passengers on the @entity72 lines were stranded for about two hours while police officers chased the cats down the tracks			2
according to the @entity181 , a spokeswoman said police officers went onto the tracks to roust the cats so they would n't be at risk			2
she also said the @entity78 did not wish to accidentally ' fry ' the kittens			0
crews suspended regular service from @entity190 to @entity191 and @entity192 just after 11am and provided shuttle buses			0
hiding : this is the little kitty who brought @entity33 's busy subway to a standstill for two hours			2

two kittens *dubbed* august and @entity1 delayed trains for two hours
they have now been adopted by married @entity6 couple
@entity205 shut down power to rescue cats
@entity209 chair @entity61 , who is running for mayor , said he would n't have stopped subway service for sake of cats
@entity103 's campaign said he would have *jumped* on the tracks himself to rescue them
