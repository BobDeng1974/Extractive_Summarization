his turbulent love life and antics in @entity3 might have dominated headlines in recent weeks but prince @entity5 put high jinks to one side as he laid a wreath honouring @entity10 soldiers in @entity12 's @entity11			1
the 29 - year - old travelled to @entity12 on a Â£ 143 @entity15 flight - not the first time he has used the budget carrier , but still a highly unusual mode of transport for an official royal visit			1
prince @entity5 's trip coincides with the return home of the last members of the @entity10 contingent from @entity24 , where they fought under @entity26 command and nine were killed			1
and it seems his appreciation of all things @entity10 is fully reciprocated , after a cheering crowd of more than 300 people turned up to greet him as he arrived at @entity11			2
mingling with well - wishers , the prince stopped and posed for a number of selfies and earned himself a big smile from one local lady , whose crown - shaped placard he signed			0
he could n't resist a cheerful chat with the local ladies and swiftly set about winning hearts and minds as he arrived in @entity10 to start a two - day tour			0
one little girl seemed a bit overcome and snuggled bashfully into her father 's chest after presenting a delighted prince @entity5 with her @entity68 flag			0
after meeting the crowds , prince @entity5 , who flew in on an @entity15 plane , paused to contemplate the cross-topped memorial dedicated to freedom fighters that dominates @entity12 's central square			1
@entity75 to meet you ! the prince beamed as he greeted the crowd , many of whom were waving @entity68 flags bashful : slightly overcome , the little girl then turned her face away shyly much to the amusement of the prince chat : after his walk about in @entity12 , the prince went on to lay a wreath in honour of @entity10 's fallen soldiers excited : one little girl with an @entity95 plastic hand looked absolutely thrilled as prince @entity5 shook her ' hand ' enjoying the day : the prince took his time on the walkabout among cheering locals in @entity10 capital @entity12 the prince , a serving @entity103 officer , wore the all white tropical no 1 dress of the @entity105 and watched as two @entity10 servicemen carefully placed his wreath at the base of the monument			1
built from large glass blocks , it commemorates the 1918 - 1920 war of independence that saw the fledging country defeat @entity116 and @entity117 forces in its struggle for self - determination			0
the @entity26 supported @entity10 's fight for freedom and was one of the first to answer its call for help , providing naval support , armaments and other equipment - a move that defended the coastline and allowed the new country to build its own navy			0
the blooms on @entity5 's wreath featured some of @entity10 's national colours , blue and white , and pinned to a ribbon attached to the floral tribute was a handwritten note that said : ' in memory of all those who gave their lives for their country - @entity5 '			2
sombre : after greeting the crowds , prince @entity5 paid his respects in a wreath - laying ceremony in @entity12 solemn : he was joined for the ceremony by senior members of the @entity10 army which fought in @entity24 salute : the prince saluted as he and the crowd observed a minute 's silence in honour of @entity10 's fallen the prince bent down to adjust the wreath then took a few steps back and paused in a mark of respect as a bugler played the last post before saluting the monument during a minute 's silence			1
after paying his respects , the prince was driven off to a military hospital where he met wounded @entity24 victims - some of whom will compete in the @entity169 in september - before addressing the @entity170			2
tomorrow , the prince is due to meet @entity10 's president , @entity173 , and military leaders in @entity175 before observing @entity178 's @entity177 military exercise			0
on sunday , the 29 - year - old will travel to @entity180 for the first time since visiting on a family holiday in 1985 , where he will attend a number of events commemorating the @entity188 campaign during @entity189			1
his trip to @entity180 will include a visit to @entity192 , where he will attend the @entity195 service at the @entity196 , and a trip to @entity198			0
prince @entity5 has travelled with @entity15 in the past , but always for private holidays - such as his summer visit to @entity201 in 2011			2
in august 2012 the @entity202 and @entity203 also used @entity15 for a private visit to the @entity205 - even waiting in line with all the other passengers during security checks			0
it remains highly unusual , however , for a senior member of the @entity211 to use a budget carrier for an official visit			0
ceremonial : two @entity10 soldiers carefully carried prince @entity5 's wreath to the monument in @entity11 heartfelt : the wreath bore a message from @entity220 dedicated to the memory of soldiers who died fighting address : after the wreath - laying ceremony , prince @entity5 addressed the @entity170 in @entity12 enjoying himself : prince @entity5 smiles as he meets dignitaries after his speech at the @entity170 meeting : @entity10 troops in @entity24 are greeted by former pm @entity229 during a visit to @entity231 favourite : prince @entity5 has twice served in @entity24 and proved a hit with @entity26 and @entity10 comrades work : captain @entity234 , as he 's known in the @entity103 , served as an @entity237 pilot during his last tour of duty			1
