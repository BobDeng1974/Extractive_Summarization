the sub-sea passage that runs below the @entity8 , will link the @entity5 and @entity4 shores of @entity10 for the first time			2
the opening of the major engineering project marks the completion of a plan initially proposed by an @entity17 sultan about 150 years ago			1

after eight years of construction , @entity1 has opened the first rail tunnel under the @entity8 the sub-sea passage that opens today , runs below the @entity8 ( centre ) and will link the @entity5 and @entity4 shores of @entity10 for the first time it is intended to ease traffic congestion and pollution in @entity10 as well as creating an important trading route , which connects @entity29 and @entity30			1
the tunnel is among a number of large infrastructure projects under the government of prime minister @entity35 that have helped boost the economy but also have provoked a backlash of public protest			0
the tunnel is 13.6 kilometres ( 8.5 miles ) long , with 1.4 kilometres ( 4,593 feet ) running under the @entity8 - the strait that connects the @entity41 to the @entity42 and divides @entity10 between @entity5 and @entity30			2

officials hope that with a 1.5 million passengers a day , it will ease some of @entity10 's terrible traffic , particularly over the two bridges that currently connect the two sides of the city			1
the project started in 2005 and was scheduled to be completed in four years , but was delayed by important archaeological finds , including a 4th century @entity71 port , as builders began digging under the city			0
the tunnel has raised fears that it could be vulnerable to earthquakes in a region of high seismic activity			0
but @entity1 transportation minister @entity79 said that it is designed to withstand a massive 9.0 magnitude quake			0
he calls it ' the safest place in @entity10			0
' @entity84 is said to have first proposed the idea of a tunnel under the @entity8 about a century and a half ago and one of his successors , @entity90 , had architects submit proposals in 1891 , but the plans were not carried out			2

the new tunnel is intended to ease traffic congestion and pollution in the city as well as connecting its @entity4 and @entity5 shores the tunnel is just one of prime minister @entity35 's large - scale plans			1
others include a separate tunnel being built under the @entity8 for cars , a third bridge over the strait , the world 's biggest airport and a massive canal that would bypass the @entity8			0
the projects have provoked accusations that the government is going ahead with city - changing plans without sufficient public consultation and the concern fueled protests that swept @entity1 in june			0
today 's ceremony at 1pm gmt falls on the 90th anniversary of the founding of the @entity1			1
it will be attended by prime minister @entity35 and other officials including @entity49 prime minister @entity48 , whose country was heavily involved in the construction and financing of the railway tunnel project .			2

@entity1 's sub-sea tunnel will open today at 1pm gmt and at 55 metres deep , will be the deepest submerged railway tunnel of its type in the world
the opening of the major engineering project marks the *competition* of a plan initially proposed by an @entity17 sultan about 150 years ago
it is hoped the tunnel will ease traffic congestion and pollution in @entity10 and create a trading route , which will connect @entity29 and @entity30
