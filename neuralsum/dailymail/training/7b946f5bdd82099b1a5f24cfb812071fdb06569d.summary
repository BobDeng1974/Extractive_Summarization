by @entity0 to solve the rising number of plastic bottles filling up landfills around the world , a trio of designers has created an alternative - a container made from an edible algae balloon			1
called @entity10 , the spheres can be produced in different sizes , hygienically protect the liquid inside , and cost just 2 cents ( less than a penny ) each			1
the design was recently crowned one of 12 winners of the second annual @entity18 and is due to go on sale in @entity20 later this year			2
@entity21 , pictured , has a double gelatinous membrane created using sodium alginate and calcium chloride			1
the spheres are created using gelification - a technique used in cooking to turn liquids into gel - and its creators said the final package is ' cheap , hygienic and biodegradable ' the @entity10 sphere has a double gelatinous membrane			1
it is made using a mixture of sodium alginate , taken from brown algae , and calcium chloride			1
the spheres are created using gelification - a technique used in cooking to turn liquids into gel by adding an edible gelling agent			1
the inventors experimented with various spherification techniques , using different ingredients and proportions , before settling on the @entity10 final ‘ recipe ’			2
packaging labels can be added to the @entity10 , between the two layers , without adhesive , and are edible too , if they ’re made from rice paper , for example			0
' liquid forms drops because the liquid exhibits surface tension , ’ said @entity21 's creators @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , ‘ bounded completely or almost completely by free surfaces			1
‘ @entity10 replicates this behaviour , encircling the water in an edible membrane of algae			2
‘ it is a new way of packaging that proposes an alternative to the plastic bottle			0

@entity58 said the final package is ‘ simple , resistant , hygienic , biodegradable and even edible			2

the @entity10 was designed as an alternative to these bottles in a bid to reduce waste and the impact plastic production has on the environment the inventors experimented with various spherification techniques , using different ingredients and proportions , before settling on the @entity10 final ‘ recipe ’			0

‘ nowadays only big companies have the infrastructure to manufacture packaging , ’ continued @entity58			0
‘ the main idea of @entity10 is that everyone could make them at their kitchen , modifying and innovating the recipe			0

the @entity10 algae balloon was created by a trio of @entity126 - based designers
its gelatinous membrane is made of sodium alginate and calcium chloride
the spheres are created using gelification - a technique used in cooking
this means they can be created by anyone with *access* to the *materials*
@entity21 's creators said the final package is ' hygienic and biodegradable '
@entity10 costs approximately 2 cents ( less than a penny ) a unit
it was named one of 12 winners of the @entity18 2014
