it 's no secret that men tend to see younger women as more attractive , but the extreme to which this holds true is somewhat alarming			1
according to a graph based on data from @entity9 dating profiles , women tend to be most attracted to men who are around their same age			1
but the case is drastically different for men ; the graph shows that once a woman passes the age of 22 , she becomes exponentially less attractive to men			1
at an event in mid-august , mr @entity24 , 39 , explained the results to a dumbfounded crowd			0
' women who are , say , 28 , find guys who are also 28 about the most attractive , and so forth			0
up until about 40 , when that 's getting too old , ' he said			0
by contrast , women begin to decline in attractiveness - from the perspective of men - as soon as they hit their early twenties			1
' it is kind of terrible , ' he admitted			0
' from the time you 're 22 you 'll be less hot than a 20 - year - old , based on this data			0
so that 's just a thing			0
' the opposite sex : by contrast , women tend to be most attracted to men who are around their same age - until they hit about 40 years old while these stats may be depressing , mr @entity24 clarifies that it does n't mean all women over 22 should necessarily expect to be left high and dry			1
' this is just measuring people 's opinions , not what they actually go out and do , ' he told @entity65			0
read about it : @entity9 president @entity24 presents these results in hist forthcoming book @entity70 , which hits stores on wednesday ' what you see when you actually look at what people do , you see the realism set in			1
so these 40 - year - old guys ... the people they actually have the courage to actually go out and message are a lot older : it 's 30 , 35 - year - old women			1
' on his blog , @entity88 , he delves into this pattern even further , explaining that as men get older they tend to search for younger and younger women			1
' the median 31 - year - old guy , for example , sets his allowable match age range from 22 to 35 - nine years younger , but only four years older , than himself , ' he writes			2
' this skewed mindset worsens with age ; the median 42 - year - old will accept a woman up to 15 years younger , but no more than three years older			2
' apart from data about age , mr @entity24 's book also details a number of other fascinating ways we interact and perceive each other			2
' if there 's one thing i sincerely hope this book might get you to reconsider , it 's what you think about yourself , ' he writes in the introduction			0
' because that 's what this book is really about			0
@entity9 is just how i arrived at the story			2

according to a graph made using @entity9 data , women are most attracted to men around their same age , until they reach about 40
by contrast , men of all ages up to 50 are most attracted to women who are no older than 24
