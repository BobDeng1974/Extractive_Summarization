@entity0 is on the verge of signing a new long - term contract as @entity3 prepares to re-launch the exciting teenager ’s season			1
@entity6 offered @entity0 fresh terms in february after he had a deep impression in a sequence of games , particularly against @entity11 and @entity12 , that coincided with an improvement in the club ’s fortunes			2
a deal has now been agreed and it is simply a case of the highly - regarded @entity0 , who has been absent since damaging knee ligaments against @entity20 on february 26 , putting pen to paper			1
@entity0 in training for @entity6 at @entity24 as he prepares to make a return from injury @entity0 is set to sign a new long - term deal at @entity6 after breaking into the first team this season @entity3 says @entity0 , 19 , has looked ‘ absolutely sensational ’ after stepping up his rehabilitation work in the last couple of weeks and he could come straight back into the starting line - up against @entity32 on monday night			1
the issue @entity3 must address is whether to stick with the 4 - 3 - 3 formation he used at @entity35 in the @entity36 last wednesday or revert to the 3 - 4 - 3 system that had been the catalyst for an improvement in results			2
one thing @entity6 ’s manager has conceded , though , is that @entity42 is unlikely to recapture his very best form this season , given all the injuries he has suffered			1
@entity0 , pictured in action against @entity12 , damaged his knee ligaments while playing against @entity20 @entity42 , who has only scored four goals in his last 15 games , admitted last week that he felt it would have to wait until the new campaign to show last year ’s sparkle and his manager agrees , following 12 months in which he has suffered thigh , calf and hip issues			1
‘ it ’s a long time out , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ when you ’re out for that length of time it maybe takes you the same amount of time to get back again			0
‘ the key for him was to get back and be fit but he needs a good pre-season under his belt , a total run at pre-season and hopefully he ’ll be fine for next season			0
until that point we have to maximise what we can get out of him			0
’ @entity3 prepares his @entity6 team for the visit of @entity32 to @entity79 on monday @entity42 is yet to rediscover his best form since returning from a lengthy injury lay off @entity3 added : ‘ every player is different			1
with @entity42 there ’s been a number of injuries that he ’s had and that ’s before he came here			0
he had a fairly sustained run last season and served us well but this season has been difficult			0
‘ he just needs to find a way to physically and mentally try to keep himself as fit as he can but sometimes that is n’t all down to you — sometimes it ’s about luck as well			0
