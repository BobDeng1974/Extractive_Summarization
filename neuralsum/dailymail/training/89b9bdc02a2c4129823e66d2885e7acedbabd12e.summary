it is one of the irritations of modern life			0
but forking out for printer cartridges may soon be a thing of the past			0
@entity7 has launched a cartridge - free printer that uses a refillable ink tank			1
the machine is the first of its kind in @entity13 , and the printer manufacturer claims it will cost a fraction of the price to fill it with ink			2
in place of costly cartridges they both have an ink reservoir			1
this can print 4,000 pages in black or 6,500 in colour on one fill			1
two printers are on sale , the @entity34 at £ 249.99 and the @entity35 ( shown ) at £ 329.99 how the costs compare of a traditional cartridge wifi printer and a new @entity39 printer the catch is that you will have to pay a lot more for the printer – but @entity7 says it will still work out cheaper in the longer term			1
calculations suggest the saving could be more than £ 100 a year			0
until now manufacturers have sold their printers on the cheap , relying on the exorbitant cost of the inkjet cartridges to make a profit			2
those cartridges – of which @entity13 buy 50million a year – contain as little as 3ml of ink			2
and with many printers needing four cartridges , it can cost £ 45 to refill them			1
both the @entity34 and @entity35 have print , copy and scanning functionality			1
the @entity35 also has fax , a 30 - page @entity62 and a two - line lcd screen			2
they both have @entity65 connectivity that can be used with @entity66 on smartphones or tablets			0
meanwhile the refillable ink tank system , which can print 4,000 pages in black and 6,500 in colour when full , also comes with an @entity7 warranty of one year or 30,000 pages			1
but fewer households now own a printer , instead choosing to share photographs and documents on the internet rather than printing them			0
as a result , the big firms have had to rethink their commercial model , because if people are buying fewer cartridges , firms will not make as much money on them			0
@entity7 claims its new @entity88 printers will last two years without running out of ink – based on a household printing 200 pages a month – and will then cost up to £ 32 to refill			1
but the tank adds about 25 per cent to the size of the printer			0
and the printer is more expensive			0
while a traditional cartridge wifi printer costs £ 55 , the @entity34 retails at £ 249 and the more advanced @entity96 at £ 329			1
but @entity97 , of @entity7 , claimed the new system will save the average family a large amount in the long run			0
‘ we estimate up to 65 per cent savings versus the average across the top ten printers in @entity106 , ’ he said			0
over two years , this would equate to savings of about £ 500 per machine , taking into account the initial outlay , he claimed			0
but by the @entity117 ’s calculations , comparing the @entity113 with the firm ’s popular inkjet model , the @entity112 which sells for £ 55 , that saving would be closer to £ 230			0
the new printers come with wifi connection , scanner and copier , with the @entity35 also including a fax. when using the printer for the first time the user will need to pour the ink themselves into the printer ’s tank ( shown )			1
@entity7 says this is ‘ hassle - free ’ using drip - free bottle spouts			2
once depleted refills can be bought for £ 8 - but it has to be @entity7 's own brand of ink purchasing replacement ink cartridges ( stock image shown ) for existing printers can be a costly and complex process , so the new refillable printers will be welcome new to many			1

@entity19 - based electronics company @entity7 has unveiled two new printers that have refillable tanks rather than ink cartridges
in place of costly cartridges they both have an ink reservoir
this can print 4,000 pages in black or 6,500 in colour on one fill
when depleted it costs £ 8 to refill the printers with @entity7 's own ink
two printers are on sale now , the @entity34 at £ 249.99 and the @entity35 at £ 329.99
both come with *wireless* connectivity so users can print from smartphones
