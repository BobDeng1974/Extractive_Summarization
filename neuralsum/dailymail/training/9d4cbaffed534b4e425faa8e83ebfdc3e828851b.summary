by @entity0 published : 10:25 est , 16 october 2012 updated : 03:28 est , 18 october 2012 an unemployed father - of - 12 branded ' @entity3 ’s most badly behaved dad ' was condemned by a judge today for setting a bad example to his children and making the ' lives of others miserable '			1
@entity9 , 41 , was handed an asbo to prevent him from harassing his neighbours , after a previous order banning his bad conduct expired			1
he was previously arrested on suspicion of assault against the mother of his children last month - just 20 minutes before he was due to appear in court to contest his second anti social behaviour order			1
the hearing , where @entity9 was to ' vehemently deny ' terrorising neighbours in two council boroughs , was later adjourned after prosecution lawyers informed jps that @entity9 was in police cells			2
@entity9 , left , with his partner @entity25 outside court just minutes before a hearing was about to begin and right , today , as he was given an asbo for terrorising neighbours in two council boroughs in their blood : @entity9 with children @entity32 , 15 , @entity34 , 14 and @entity35 , 13 , who have all been given @entity28 but today as he was finally banned him from being drunk in public , he made a plea from the dock , insisting : ' i should n't really be getting an @entity28 '			1
he is the fifth member of his family to have been given an asbo			2
at @entity43 , @entity9 was issued with a two - year anti social behaviour order			1
the asbo bans him from using abusive and threatening language in public , making obscene hand gestures and being drunk or in the possession of any open container of alcohol			2
@entity52 , who has never worked , has a long criminal record for robbing elderly people and once had to be sprayed with @entity56 gas by police in a row over his son ’s football			1
council officials had kicked the family out of one of their previous homes in @entity43 , @entity66 , after 125 complaints from neighbours who had endured three years of loud parties , fighting and drunken behaviour			2
his twin boys @entity35 and @entity73 , aged 13 , already have two - year @entity28 ordering them not to cause ' harassment , alarm or distress '			1
police secured interim @entity28 against their big sisters @entity34 and @entity32 , aged 14 and 15 - but both were dropped after there were no further reports against them of bad behaviour			2
last month @entity9 tried to make a legal challenge against the application to issue him with the asbo			1
but he failed when he was arrested outside the courthouse for tipping a carton of @entity90 juice over his long - suffering partner			1
vicious : the father - of - 12 tipped a carton of @entity90 juice over miss @entity25 last month he claimed his predominantly @entity95 neighbourhood singled him out and reported him to police because they disapproved of his heavy drinking			1
but district judge mr @entity100 warned he faced jail if he stepped out of line again and retorted : ' i do n’t think it is a clash of cultures , i think the problem is him being drunk			0
arrested : the earlier hearing was adjourned after prosecution lawyers informed jps that he was in police cells ' if he is involved in disorderly behaviour that does not set a good example to the children and looking through the papers that ’s what has been going on and clearly making the lives of others miserable			2
' this is a dreadful category of anti-social behaviour , being drunk outside , shouting abuse and general disturbance to others makes their lives miserable			0
' if you breach this order , the maximum sentence is of five years in prison			2
' if there is a repeat of this sort of behaviour and you are on breach i will be looking at the sentencing guidelines for persistent breach of the asbo			0
' do not assume that if you breach it you will only be getting a fine of £ 50			0
' the @entity28 will apply in the @entity43 area but will not stretch to his new address in @entity142 where he and his family moved for a ' fresh start '			0
@entity9 has never worked , claiming sickness benefit for depression since he was 17			1
' @entity3 's worst - behaved dad ' has been jailed previously for mugging pensioners and stealing in a cemetery in april 1999 he was jailed for two - and - a - half years for mugging three pensioners and stealing a handbag from a woman of 78 in a cemetery			1
partner @entity25 , who left their children with a babysitter so she could act as his getaway driver , was jailed for a year			1
in august 2004 he suffered head injuries when he was attacked by a neighbour armed with a 2ft - long machete amid claims a text message had been sent threatening to firebomb the home of the attacker ’s mother			1
then in 2007 @entity9 sparked a police siege after a row over a neighbour confiscating his children ’s football			1
he was said to have lost his temper and hurled cutlery and a vacuum cleaner towards officers before being overpowered with @entity56 gas			0
@entity9 had previously been issued with an asbo but after it expired last november the couple and eight of their children moved into a £ 150 - a - week rented three - bedroomed terrace house in @entity142 hoping to make a ' fresh start '			1
the parents arriving at court today as @entity9 was condemned for setting a bad example to his children but he was arrested again and given an interim asbo earlier this year			1
representing @entity189 , mr @entity188 said : ' he has shown low - level , persistent anti-social behaviour which makes life a misery for other people			2
' it is his drunk and disorderly behaviour that is a problem , but not necessarily targeting specific people			0
' perhaps some of it stemming from a family of 13 , this happened largely in the @entity43 borough			0
' in mitigation , defence solicitor mr @entity203 said : ' on july 1st the family moved to @entity142 and it has been a good three months without any issues			0
' there were problems which grew over a period of time in @entity43 , to a degree there was a clash of cultures			0
' he had a large family living in a predominantly @entity218 area and he would drink and that would be frowned upon in the community			0
' mr @entity9 was more the victim			2
there was a confrontation with a group of males with baseball bats , maybe they are more at fault			0
' there have been other incidents where drink has been involved			0
he was n’t well liked in the area			0
they wanted to move and wanted a fresh start , it has been a fresh start			0
there has not been any problem in @entity142 and he said he wishes never to go back to @entity43			0
' there is always going to be a bit of noise when there are eight children living there			0
' they have been brought up properly and their behaviour has always been good - to question him as a father is not right			0
