this is the moment police busted an illegal immigrant who 'd risked life and limb trying to enter @entity5 by stowing away next to the propellers of a ferry			1
the desperate @entity9 man , 48 , had clambered on to the vessel in @entity11 , @entity12 , on saturday - clinging on for dear life for more than two hours as the boat crossed the @entity15			1
he had planned to jump into the water , as the ferry came close to shore , and then swim to land			1
but national police officers heard of his plot and were waiting for him as the ferry was about to dock in @entity33			1
the man was arrested and taken to an immigration detention centre			2
it is not the first time a foreign national has stared death in the face trying to get into a country			2
the 48 - year - old was going to jump into the sea close to the blades and swim to shore - an incredibly risky plan busted : officers lead the man away			1
he was taken to an immigrant detention centre by @entity49 in june 2010 a stowaway hid in the undercarriage of a jumbo jet and survived temperatures of -41c at 25,000ft during a free flight into @entity56			0
the jobless @entity57 crouched in the rear - wheel compartment during an extraordinary 800 - mile trip from @entity60 to @entity61 on a @entity62 owned by the @entity64 royal family			1
airport officals say the man could easily have been crushed by the plane 's wheels or killed by a lack of oxygen and was ' incredibly lucky ' to be alive			0
he was taken to @entity72 police station but because he was apparently of previous good character , he was given a police caution and released from custody at 2.47pm on monday			2
the man was carrying @entity77 and immigration officials were satisfied he was @entity57 and entitled to stay			0
records collated by the @entity80 suggest that at best one in four stowaways survives , but many others die or fall in transit			0
survivors rarely escape unscathed and frostbite claims many limbs			0
in 2009 an illegal immigrant smuggled himself into @entity56 underneath a coach full of @entity90 officials			0
the immigration officers were not aware of the stowaway until they had completed their journey through the @entity94 from @entity95 and had arrived at their depot in @entity97 .			0

the 48 - year - old clung to rear of ferry right next to the *churning* blades
he aimed to swim to land and clamber over a fence to enter country
however , @entity5 police knew about plot and were waiting on the shore
