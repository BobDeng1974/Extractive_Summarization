by @entity0 the @entity1 formally submitted an emergency request to @entity3 on tuesday for $ 3.7 billion in additional funding for security measures and humanitarian efforts at the @entity8 border with @entity9			1
nearly half of the money the @entity1 is asking for would go toward providing housing and medical services for illegal immigrant children			1
another third would go toward the @entity17 agency			0
but only $ 116 million of the $ 1.1 billion set aside for @entity17 would be used to deport the unaccompanied minors at the center of the humanitarian crisis on the border			1
the bulk of that money the @entity1 wants @entity3 to appropriate to @entity17 , $ 879 million , would go toward detaining and deporting adults who are accompanied by children when they cross the border			1
in that letter , the president indicated that he would like to see changes to a 2008 trafficking law that the administration says is slowing down its deportation efforts and additional money appropriated to various agencies that handle illegal immigration			1
the president said would be reaching out to @entity3 when it returned from recess this week with a specific sum			0
@entity1 officials told the @entity53 that they planned to ask @entity3 for more than $ 2 billion on tuesday			2
when the final language came back today , the president asked for nearly double that amount			0
among the requests for emergency funding were : $ 45 million for an additional 40 teams of immigration judges , $ 295 million for @entity61 countries to address the root causes of mass migration of children to the @entity8 and $ 5 million for a campaign to discourage parents in @entity61 from sending their children with smugglers			0
crisis : more than 47,000 unaccompanied children have entered the country illegally since oct. 1 , including 9,700 in the @entity72 alone hot seat : secretary of homeland security @entity74 said sunday that ' we need to find more efficient , effective ways to turn this tide around ' missing from the @entity1 's petition were detailed changes to the 2008 law the administration has consistently blamed for the humanitarian crisis on the border			1
that law , passed by a @entity86 - controlled @entity3 , was meant to provide protection for children brought into the @entity8 as part of human trafficking schemes , mostly related to the illicit sex trade			1
in the absence of a move on @entity95 , the federal government has no choice but to treat the deluge of illegal immigrant children arriving from @entity61 countries the same way			2
that process can take weeks or months and tie up resources – including @entity8 @entity104 agents – making the border even more porous			0
the @entity1 's chief spokesman admitted monday that most on the tens of thousands of unaccompanied illegal immigrant children crossing the @entity8 - @entity9 border are unlikely to qualify for humanitarian relief that would prevent them from being sent back from their home countries			1
however , the 2008 law requires that illegal immigrant children who come to the @entity8 from non-contiguous countries are provided due process before they are sent back home			1
president @entity30 told congressional leaders in his letter last week that his administration would seek an amendment to the law that would allow the @entity122 more latitude to fast - track deportations of children from @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity125			0
he did not include specific language his administration would like to see added to the law at that time , and all the president said on the matter in a letter accompanying his budgetary request today is that the administration would continue to work with @entity3 to make the previously recommended legislative changes			0
@entity1 press secretary @entity134 said this afternoon that senior @entity1 administration officials and and senior - level congressional leaders had been in talks since last week about changes to the law but they had not yet come to an agreement			0
@entity134 was unable to explain what changes to the law the administration would like to see @entity3 make , saying only that the @entity1 is seeking additional authorization for greater discretion in enforcing that law			2
however he did say the administration is not proposing to eliminate due process or medical screenings for illegal immigrant children			2
what steps the administration intends to have @entity3 cut out of the processing requirements for illegal immigrant children to be sent back home if not one of the main requirements is clear as mud			1
in a statement addressing the president 's request for additional funding , @entity154 , a spokesman for @entity1 speaker @entity155 , told reporters : ' the @entity161 and other members , including the working group on the border crisis led by rep. @entity165 , will review the @entity1 proposal			2
' the speaker still supports deploying the @entity167 to provide humanitarian support in the affected areas - which this proposal does not address , ' he said			2
asked about both @entity155 and @entity172 governor @entity171 's calls for the president to send the @entity167 to @entity175 river area in @entity172 , @entity134 said , ' there already has been made a historic investment in border security , and we 're seeing the benefits of that investment along the border			0
' @entity183 - $ 1.1 billion $ 116 million would pay for transportation costs for unaccompanied minors			1
$ 109 million would support other immigration and customs enforcement efforts			0
$ 879 million would pay for detention and deportation of adults traveling with children who enter the @entity8 illegally , including the expansion of alternatives to detention programs and prosecution capacity			0
@entity122 , @entity196 - $ 433 million $ 364 million would pay for operational costs $ 29 million would be appropriated to @entity196 to expand its role in @entity200 programs			0
$ 39.4 million would go to increasing air surveillance of the border			0
@entity203 - $ 64 million $ 45.4 million would go toward hiring approximately 40 additional immigration judge teams			0
$ 2.5 million would be used to expand a program that provides legal assistance to adults and guardians of children in the immigration court system $ 15 million would help fund legal representation for children in immigration proceedings $ 1.1 million would be used to hire additional immigration litigation attorneys @entity215 and @entity216 - $ 300 million $ 295 million would go to @entity61 countries for repatriation and reintegration efforts , border security and programs that address the root causes of mass migration			1
$ 5 million would support media campaigns in @entity9 , @entity125 , @entity126 , and @entity225 explaining that unaccompanied minors will not receive amnesty in the @entity8 this category of money would also support youth leadership development programs			2
@entity231 - $ 1.8 @entity232 of this money would go toward caring for illegal immigrant children who cross the border and includes money to fund additional housing facilities and medical treatment			1

the @entity1 wants @entity3 to give it billions to pay for a variety of programs *targeted* at illegal immigration determent and enforcement
included in its request is $ 1.1 billion to provide humanitarian care to the *hundreds* of illegal immigrant children who cross the border every day
hardly any of the money would go toward deporting unaccompanied minors
the *executive* branch is working with @entity3 to change a 2008 law aimed at trafficking *victims* that is holding up deportations of immigrant children
a @entity86 - controlled @entity3 passed the measure in 2008 , and now the @entity1 wants a *loophole* to deal with the children at the border
