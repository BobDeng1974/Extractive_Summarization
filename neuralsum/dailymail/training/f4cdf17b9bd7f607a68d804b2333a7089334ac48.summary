the @entity0 changed their minds this week after originally stating they were not going to allow candy canes in common areas on @entity4			0
when executive director of @entity7 sent out an email on monday saying that religious themed decorations including candy canes and @entity12 trees were going to be banned from public spaces , students were outraged and were able to sway the school administration in their favor			1
the school later apologized for banning the decorations and called the whole incident a ' misunderstanding ' citing the fact they were merely trying to be inclusive following a student 's complaint about @entity25 ' religious ' decorations			1
banned decorations : administrators at the @entity0 banned all @entity12 decorations on monday ' we are not the grinches of @entity0 , @entity32 @entity31 told @entity33			1
' it was a big misunderstanding			2
the e-mail was in response to an issue a student had raised			1
his intent was to be inclusive			2
' @entity7 originally banned any ' decoration that could be perceived as religious ' and listed off items such as ' xmas trees , wreaths , xmas presents , candy canes , etc. ' ' what is allowed are winter themes , plain trees without presents underneath , decorative lights , but not on trees , snowflakes , etc. if you are unsure , best to not use or ask me for clarification , ' he said in his initial email			1
students at the school were so outraged after monday 's email they started a @entity63 group dedicated to bringing back decorations on campus called ' @entity66 back to @entity0 ' that now has almost 1,000 supporters			1
they 're back : after students complained about the lack of holiday cheer on campus the school allowed them to decorate with candy canes once again ' how can we celebrate diversity if we ca n't even see it ? # bringbackthecheer , ' the group posted two days ago following monday 's news			2
' they did n't have to say it			0
they took down items put up by students expressing their 1st amendment rights			0
that is a violation of the @entity86			0
whom ever made that decision has opened himself and the college up to multiple lawsuits , ' said @entity91			0
