it is the iconic festival made famous by @entity2 author @entity1 , but the running of the bulls has been rocked by negative publicity in recent years			1
so these @entity7 locals have come up with an unusual solution that will prevent any potential harm or stress to animals			0
the town of @entity13 , just north of @entity14 , is staging an annual event in which locals can race through the streets chased by a giant white ball			1
the running of the balls has been held for the past three years and it is known in the region as boloencierro			1
during the video the residents run down the street excitedly as a group of men push the giant ball behind them			0
it may lack the excitement of of an angry bull breathing down their necks , but these locals seem to enjoy the celebration just as much			2
and there is less risk of injury			0
during the famous @entity41 this year , a number of both holidaymakers and locals were gored during the running of the bulls			1
since records began in 1924 , as many as 15 people have been killed while taking part in the dangerous activity			0
twist : residents and visitors in @entity13 near @entity14 participate in the third running of the balls it 's coming : the participants look behind them as the ball approaches in @entity13 during the event while bullfighting is banned in @entity60 , it is still a common practice in other parts of @entity7			1
however , there are some other interesting alternatives			0
instead off fighting the bulls , agile men known as ' recortadors ' perform daring stunts with the bulls in some areas of the country			2
as the animal charge , the men leap over their and dive out of their way , showing off their agility			0
the bull remains unharmed and is not killed at thee end of the fight			2
cruel : crowds of people run from a bull at the @entity82 event at the nine day @entity84 festival dangerous : a man falls over as a bull approaches during the @entity82 event in @entity88 @entity89 which is an acrobatic and non-violent form of bullfightingis becoming more popular in @entity7 winners : the winners in recortador are the participants who show the least fear and get closest to the bulls			1

running of the balls event has been running for three years in @entity13
event is an alternative to the *controversial* running of the bulls events
animal *welfare* *campaigners* have been calling for an end to bull running
