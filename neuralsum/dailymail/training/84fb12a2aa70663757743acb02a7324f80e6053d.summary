@entity1 's attack on the @entity3 seeding system @entity4 have confirmed a revamp to their seeding allocation for the @entity3			1
from the 2015 - 16 campaign , the champions from the top seven leagues in @entity4 will feature as top seeds along with the holders of the competition			1
@entity13 's chief sports writer @entity1 attacked the current seeding system , highlighting the absurdity of @entity16 , who finished fourth in the @entity19 last season , being in @entity20 while title winners @entity22 were in @entity23			2
@entity22 would be top seeds in the @entity3 if they retain their @entity19 title but for @entity16 , the new rules leave them on the cusp of losing their top seed place in the @entity3 having not won the @entity19 title in over 10 years were the new rules in play this season , here 's how @entity20 would have looked : 1 @entity35 - @entity34 2 @entity36 - @entity22 3 @entity38 - @entity37 4 @entity40 - @entity39 5 @entity42 - @entity41 6 @entity44 - @entity43 7 @entity46 - @entity45 8 holders - @entity48 but @entity49 has revealed that talks took place earlier this year and the plans over seeding - which are the same as @entity1 outlined in @entity13 - were approved by the club competition committee in may			1
@entity4 president @entity55 hopes the rules would stop domestic champions in the major @entity59 leagues being ranked lower than other clubs from their nations			0
it would also prevent situations like in this season 's @entity64 where the champions of @entity42 ( @entity41 ) , @entity35 ( @entity34 ) , @entity67 ( @entity68 ) and @entity69 ( @entity70 ) are all in together			0
the system currently works on the co-efficient system , where clubs ' previous @entity3 performances and the ranking of their domestic league is taken into account			0
both clubs have previously enjoyed top - seed status due to their high @entity4 coefficient			2
under the new rules , only the @entity19 champions would go into pot one next season .			0

top seeds would be holders and winners of @entity4 's top seven leagues
@entity19 among the top seven in @entity3
new system to come into force from the 2015 - 16 campaign
changes could see @entity16 and @entity87 lose their top *billing*
