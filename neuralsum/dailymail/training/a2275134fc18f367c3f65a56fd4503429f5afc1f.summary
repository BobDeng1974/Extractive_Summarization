by @entity0 published : 12:16 est , 6 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:39 est , 6 february 2014 molester : @entity4 , 83 , was jailed for eight years today after being found guilty of indecency with a child and indecent assault a former headmaster at @entity10 's old prep school has been jailed for eight years for abusing his pupils			1
@entity4 , 83 , was convicted of assaulting five boys aged between eight and 13 at @entity13 between 1959 and 1970			1
the court heard how @entity4 ' used boys at a whim ' by molesting and simulating sex with them at the school in @entity20 , @entity21			1
he joined the school in 1952 , and was headmaster from 1968 until his retirement in 1993			0
mr @entity10 was a student at @entity13 , which now charges fees of Â £ 22,000 a year , from 1974 to 1980 , and was head boy			1
during the trial in december , the jury heard how @entity4 ran the school 's rugby team and would have his favourite blond , blue - eyed boys who he would reward with trips in his sports car			1
he would also invite them into his bedsit to watch television and drink whisky			1
@entity4 was handed his prison term today despite the death of another former teacher who was due to be sentenced alongside him			2
@entity42 , 82 , was found dead on tuesday after apparently throwing himself under a train			0
@entity4 had been convicted of 10 counts of indecent assault and two counts of indecency with a child			2
sentencing @entity4 at @entity50 today , judge @entity49 told how he ' took advantage ' of boys desperate for his approval and would use a bedsit next to the boys ' dormitory to carry out his crimes			1
he said : ' i readily accept that you dedicated your life to this school			0
great trust was placed in you yet you abused that trust			0
' ' [ but ] far from protecting and nurturing the boys you used them at a whim - to satisfy what you wanted from them regardless of the impact on them			0
' prestigious : @entity4 was headmaster at the prep school , which now costs Â £ 22,000 a year ' boys craved your attention and strove for your praise			1
from those you picked out boys for your individual sexual attentions			2
' his victims were aged primarily 11 , 12 or 13 , the @entity82 said , and often members of the rugby team			0
she said : ' some boys felt confused , some flattered by the attention and many felt it was just what happened when you got mr @entity4 's attention			1
' you used the proximity of the room to the dormitories and the distance of that area from the rest of the school to set up your own little fiefdom and used it to abuse boys			2
' the judge said those who were abused should not feel guilt or consider they were complicit in any way			0
' appalled ' : @entity42 , 82 , left , was due to be sentenced today as well , but was found dead earlier this week			0
@entity10 , right , an old boy of the school , said he was ' shocked and appalled ' by the revelations when both men were found guilty in december ' all were children in the care of an adult who had little but his own sexual gratification in mind			1
' judge @entity49 said that she took into account @entity4 's poor health , and the facts that he needs daily care and is no longer a threat to children			2
but she said she imposed the sentence , half of which will be spent in custody , because of the ' lasting effect ' of the abuse on his former students			0
she said : ' i can not ignore the impact of your behaviour on so many boys			0
it is clear from the impact statements that i have read that your conduct has had a lasting effect upon them			0
' ' looking at the entirety of your offending the least sentence i can impose is one of eight years ' imprisonment			0
' @entity4 was also ordered to sign the sex offenders ' register , and will be banned from working with children .			1
