@entity0 : chancellor of the exchequer @entity1 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself ’ was the famous exhortation delivered to the @entity7 people by @entity8 when he became @entity7 president in 1933			1
his opponent in the preceding election , the hapless @entity13 , had spent much of the campaign insisting that the only real problem with the economy was a lack of confidence			1
of course , @entity8 ’s catchphrase and @entity13 ’s analysis actually amounted to saying the same thing in different ways			2
but @entity8 went on to become the longest - serving president yet and @entity13 is regarded as one of the great failures of @entity7 politics			0
@entity1 seems to have learnt directly from the @entity8 playbook			1
every word of his autumn statement was laced with tactical electoral calculations and a determination to limit @entity33 ’s room for manoeuvre to virtually zero			0
in many areas , the chancellor has stolen the @entity38 ’s clothes and is daring them to criticise him for putting them on			0
an objective assessment of the @entity42 ’s strategy would point to the stark failure to reduce the vast budget deficit			1
this now appears to be stuck , for the time being at about £ 90 billion – meaning that the government is overspending by around £ 1,500 for every man , woman and child in @entity51 , every year			1
the government ’s declared intention was to eliminate this deficit by the time of the next general election			1
@entity1 has missed that target by several country miles			1
tax receipts have been lower than expected			0
and despite all the sound and fury about ‘ the age of austerity ’ , overall government spending is down by only a fraction in real terms			1
in normal circumstances , you might think that the governing party would expect to be hounded from office in the upcoming election			2
@entity1 is having none of such talk			1
instead , he is displaying the hide of a rhino and the cunning of a fox			1
shadow chancellor @entity78 will point across the @entity79 and rage about how the deficit is far greater than the @entity81 promised			2
but the unspoken truth is that the @entity42 have long since abandoned their plan to get spending under control			0
instead , they have basically adopted the much slower , much less ambitious target proposed by the @entity33 at the last election – to close off the deficit in about ten years rather than in only five			1
that is exactly what is happening			0
so what are the @entity33 complaining about exactly ? i am not so cynical as to suggest that the chancellor has deliberately failed to eliminate the government ’s overspend on target			1
but he appears to have concluded that such a failure may actually give him an extra ace up his sleeve			2
if state expenditure were more tightly under control , voters might accept that the @entity112 ’ work had been completed and they could now afford to put in place a @entity33 - led government to go on a spending spree			2
but @entity1 ’s plea is that his task is only half - done and you simply ca n’t trust @entity33 to complete it			1
this is why the @entity121 mantra of the need for a ‘ long - term economic plan ’ is the centrepiece of their campaign			0
@entity127 set out his theories in 1513 's the prince changes in stamp duty were the most dramatic tax change unveiled by the chancellor last week			0
but even here the motivation seems to be to set a clever political trap for his opponents			0
ending the absurd cliff - edge effects of the previous system was a very good move in principle			0
but the devil was in the detail			0
the political thinking of @entity1 was most definitely in the detail too			1
properties worth more than £ 2 million will see a dramatic rise in stamp duty			2
this is likely to mean that large @entity151 properties become harder to sell or fall in value			0
it also makes imposing a mansion tax on top of this is now even harder to justify			0
in essence , @entity1 has introduced a ‘ mansion purchase tax ’			1
for @entity33 to demand a further tax on top of this for owning a so - called mansion , in addition to buying one , now looks even more like the narrow - minded politics of envy			0
the government is still raising and spending far too much money			2
our absurdly complex tax rulebook gets even longer and more complicated every time the chancellor makes a statement			2
those of us who want dramatic economic reform will feel the @entity42 has been rather unambitious			0
but observers of raw electoral tactics might consider @entity1 something of a genius			1
indeed , had the master of the dark political arts , @entity127 , been present last wednesday , it is likely that he would have been the first to rise to his feet and applaud .			0

the vast budget deficit appears to be stuck at £ 90 billion for the time being
this means the government is overspending by £ 1,500 for every person
the *coalition* had intended to eliminate the deficit by next election
