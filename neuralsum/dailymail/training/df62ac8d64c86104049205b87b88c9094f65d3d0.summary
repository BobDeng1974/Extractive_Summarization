by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 17:32 est , 1 january 2013 updated : 04:05 est , 2 january 2013 praise : health secretary @entity2 described the pathway as ' a fantastic step forward ' an influential group of @entity7 doctors yesterday called for an end to financial ‘ bribes ’ that encourage hospitals to place dying patients on the controversial @entity12			1
the @entity13 said judgments about whether to withdraw treatment from terminally - ill patients should be made solely on clinical grounds			1
the @entity13 , which represents more than 4,000 doctors , said financial incentives for hospitals to use the system – thought to run at more than £ 10million a year in total – should be ‘ eradicated ’ immediately			1
it also urged ministers to tighten controls to end the ‘ undoubted abuses ’ of a system designed to ensure patients die with dignity			1
dr @entity29 , a @entity30 - based consultant in palliative care , said the care pathway could help ease suffering if used properly			0
but he added : ‘ it remains a tool , and it is only as good as those who use it			0
there is always potential for misuse and abuse and there are undoubtedly instances where this occurs			0
‘ where these arise by intention then those involved should be held to account , but more often they occur through poor understanding and inadequate training			2
‘ we owe it to patients to not only furnish the means to better care , but also to equip adequately those who provide it			0
’ @entity56 and @entity55 died within ten days of one another after being put on sedatives while on @entity12 ' without family consent ' the @entity12 was developed in a @entity12 hospital and has been in use across the @entity62 for the past four years			1
payments to hospitals to introduce it are made through a system called @entity67 , which channels money to hospital trusts through @entity62 ‘ commissioners ’			2
but ministers were forced to launch an independent review of the pathway in november following a public outcry about a string of disturbing cases in which people ’s loved ones had their treatment , including food , fluids and medication , withdrawn without their knowledge or consent			2
they include a war veteran and his wife who died within days of each other after being put on the @entity12 without consent			1
@entity89 , 90 , who fought in the battle of @entity91 , died alone in a care home after he was put on the controversial end - of - life process			0
ten days later his wife @entity94 , 89 , died in the same home after she too was given sedatives and had vital food and fluids withdrawn under pathway procedures			0
their son , @entity100 , said his parents had been treated ‘ like animals who needed to be put down ’ by doctors who ‘ seemed to take it upon themselves to get rid of them ’			0
in some cases , patients have survived for months or even years after their relatives fought to have their treatment restored			0
in a provocative intervention at the weekend , the health secretary @entity2 appeared to pre-judge his own inquiry by hailing the @entity12 as a ‘ fantastic step forward ’ for the dying			1
mr @entity2 said it should not be ‘ discredited ’ because of events ‘ going wrong in one or two cases ’			0
but the @entity13 said a number of urgent steps were needed to restore public confidence in a system used in around 130,000 cases a year			1
hospitals are thought to have been rewarded with an extra £ 30million over the past three years for increasing their use of the @entity12			1
the @entity13 said these payments should be ended , with the cash diverted into better training for staff			1
it said : ‘ non-clinical priorities in the use of the pathway , especially financial priorities , must be eradicated and every patient treated solely according to their need			1
’ the organisation also said no patient should be placed on the @entity12 unless they were ‘ imminently dying ’			2
assessments should only be made by senior doctors and the decision should be discussed with patients and their families			0
anyone placed on the pathway who shows signs of improvement should be taken off it immediately			0
a shocking national audit recently revealed that up to 60,000 people die on the @entity12 every year without ever being told their treatment is being withdrawn , despite being conscious when doctors make the decision			2
the @entity13 also called for an annual audit of the care pathway to ensure it is being used properly			2
cases of abuse should be reported to the appropriate medical body , such as the @entity160 , for possible disciplinary action .			0

@entity13 said financial incentives should be ' eradicated '
urged ministers to tighten controls on @entity12 system
cash should be *reinvested* in better training for staff
