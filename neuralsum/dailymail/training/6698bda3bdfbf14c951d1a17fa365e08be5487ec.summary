by @entity0 follow @ @ samcunningham he is known as mr @entity2 , has been compared to @entity4 legend @entity3 and @entity5 believes he is the best young defender on the planet			1

@entity17 manager @entity5 adores him			1
the @entity18 left no stone unturned to make sure he became a @entity11 player when he was in charge at the @entity24 club			2
but @entity5 was already in pursuit			1
who better to convince a @entity45 teenager to join your club than @entity48 ? @entity5 set the retired midfield genius , an advisor to @entity11 president @entity51 , on the scent and the pair met on numerous occasions			1
‘ i played an active role in the transfer , ’ @entity48 said			0
‘ he is a quality player and has an incredible future ahead of him			0
’ @entity10 was flown over to @entity24 and invited to visit @entity11 ’s facilities			1

i have n’t seen many players like that			0
i have watched plenty of @entity10 and he is like @entity3 ; fast , intelligent and he is a big player			1
’ honour : he has been compared in many ways with @entity45 defensive legend @entity3 duo : @entity5 and @entity48 worked hard to bring the youngster to the club so highly - rated is @entity10 that , in april 2013 , he was voted by a @entity85 fan poll into @entity11 's best ever foreign xi - alongside the likes of @entity48 , @entity88 and @entity89 - at the age of 19			1
@entity48 would know , he lifted the @entity15 alongside his countryman in 1998			2
after @entity10 ’s first full season in @entity37 ’ senior squad , where he made 23 appearances but could not stop them getting relegated from @entity94 , @entity5 finally pounced			1
in june 2011 , @entity10 , still only 18 , passed a medical at the @entity97 and signed a six - year deal , moving for a fee understood to be in the region of £ 8million			2
the @entity45 club were disappointed to lose their star youngster but president @entity103 admitted they could not stand in the way of such a move			0
@entity10 and @entity5 hit it off straight away			1
in his first season they won the @entity110 title together			0
he scored his first goal against @entity112 in only his second game ; an audacious , sublime back - heel volley from a @entity116 corner making him the youngest foreign player , at 18 years and 152 days , to score a goal in a competitive match for @entity11			0
the following season , when he scored in the @entity121 semi-final against @entity122 he ran to the touchline and leapt into @entity5 ’s arms			2
embrace : @entity10 and @entity5 had an incredibly close relationship at @entity11 tangle : @entity10 gets involved in a champions league final scuffle between @entity128 and @entity129 their bond transcends the boundaries of football			1
‘ @entity5 is like a second father to me , ’ @entity10 said while @entity5 was still at @entity11			1
‘ in football terms , he has significant input			0
he shows his support and his faith in me			0
he finds the right words to give you the peace of mind to be able to improve , which is important			0
he ’s really close to his players			0
’ last season , under @entity146 , @entity10 added the @entity148 and @entity121 to his trophy cabinet			2
his height and leap make him formidable in the air , but he is known for his composure on the ball and his adept reading of the game , similar to @entity7 in his pomp			2
it is that approach to football – rather than an aggressive , tough tackler – where his alternative title is derived			0
‘ i really like my nickname : mr @entity2 , ’ @entity10 added			2
‘ that ’s my style			0
