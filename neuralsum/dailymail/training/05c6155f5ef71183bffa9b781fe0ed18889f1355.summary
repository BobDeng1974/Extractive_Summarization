a high court judge tightened restrictions on protests outside @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , after being told that demonstrators had caused a ' nuisance ' during @entity6 's appearance in october 2012			1
mr @entity17 concluded that existing restrictions on protests did not provide ' sufficient protection '			2
the judge issued a written ruling after a @entity23 hearing in @entity13 in may			2
protest : @entity6 arriving for a signing session of her fragrance ' fame ' at @entity11 in @entity12 , central @entity13 , in october last year @entity11 ' bosses had complained about the behaviour of protesters during @entity6 's visit on october 7			1
mr @entity17 said the star had visited the store to ' advertise some perfumery '			0
' it is @entity11 ' case that the ( protesters ) positioned themselves at the front of the crowds with banners and placards , in and amongst families and children , causing a nuisance , annoyance and harassment to members of the public in attendance enjoying the event , ' said the judge			1
' from statements , photographs and @entity55 evidence , i have a very clear understanding of the nature of the event and what happened on this occasion			0
' he said @entity11 had also complained about protesters ' behaviour on @entity64 2012 - the first day of the store 's winter sale			1
the judge said anti-fur trade campaigners began demonstrations outside @entity11 in 2005			1
store bosses launched legal action shortly afterwards and court injunctions were subsequently issued , amended and extended			2
he said exclusion zones and ' specific protest areas ' had been established but @entity11 suggested that restrictions should be extended to a pedestrianised area in nearby @entity78			1
a ' nuisance ' : anti-fur protest outside @entity11 @entity11 ' bosses had complained about the behaviour of protesters during @entity6 's visit on october 7 ' @entity11 have started to utilise to greater advantage the fully completed development of @entity88 , ' said the judge			1
' the existing order did not take into account its fully - completed state and its potential			0
' he added : ' it has become a tourist hotspot likened to the area around @entity98			0
in conjunction with the @entity101 , the store is now organising more substantial events in the @entity78 area , which are drawing larger crowds to see what effectively is a show			0
' mr @entity17 , who said @entity6 arrived in @entity88 before going into @entity11 , concluded that there had been a ' change of circumstances '			2
' i am not satisfied that the existing order provides sufficient protection for the rights of the claimants , customers and the public to enjoy the facilities and events in the crescent , ' said the judge			0
' i am equally satisfied that the rights of the ( protesters ) can be protected by ensuring that they can continue to assemble and protest outside the @entity78 area			0
