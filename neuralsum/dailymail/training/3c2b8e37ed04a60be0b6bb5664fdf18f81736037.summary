the robotic submarine being used in the hunt for missing @entity2 , has completed its first full scan of seabed in the remote @entity5			0
the @entity8 's @entity7 - 21 underwater drone spent 16 hours at a depth of 4.5km some 2,000km west of the @entity11 city of @entity12			1
analysts are now examining the data it collected in the hope of finding any sign of the aircraft which disappeared from radar screens on march 8 with 239 people aboard			1
the depth of the search area is at the very limit of @entity37 's operational capabilities and two previous missions had to be aborted due to technical problems			1
a sample taken from an oil slick in the same area , some 2,000 km ( 1,240 miles ) west of the @entity11 city of @entity12 , is also being analysed			2
authorities believe that is the most likely area where the missing jet hit the ocean after disappearing			1
a series of ' pings ' recorded earlier this month have led searchers to the remote stretch of ocean in the belief that the signals may have come from the plane 's black box recorders			0
however , with no pings received in more than a week and the black box 's battery now 10 days past its approximate expiry date , authorities are relying on the drone			2
the introduction of the @entity7 marks a methodical , slower paced new phase of the search , now in its 40th day and described by the search coordinator , retired air chief marshal @entity75 , as the most expensive in aviation history a @entity78 air force @entity77 takes off from @entity79 in @entity80 , on wednesday to assist with the international search effort for missing @entity26 on monday , the search coordinator , retired air chief marshal @entity75 , said the air and surface search for debris would likely end in three days as the operation shifted its focus to the largely unmapped area of ocean floor			1
however , authorities said on thursday up to 10 military aircraft , two civil aircraft and 11 ships would still search an area totalling about 40,000 square km. that would suggest searchers , under pressure from the families of those on board the plane , still hold some hope of finding floating wreckage			2
@entity11 prime minister @entity105 was quoted by @entity106 on wednesday as saying that ' we believe that ( underwater ) search will be completed within a week or so			0
if we do n't find wreckage , we stop , we regroup , we reconsider '			0
asked to clarify @entity105 's comments to the newspaper , his office said he was only suggesting that authorities may change the area being searched by the @entity7 - 21 drone , not that the search would be called off			1
' they 've been looking for 40 days and have n't found anything floating yet , ' @entity117 , associate professor of accident investigation and forensics at @entity119 , told the @entity122 news agency			2
' you 'd have to start saying there 's either nothing to find or let 's move elsewhere , ' he said			0
a @entity8 p - 8 poseidon aircraft flies out from @entity128 , in @entity11 , on wednesday to assist in the search for the missing plane a @entity131 ( @entity131 ) @entity133 aircraft flies past the @entity135 naval ship @entity136 in the southern @entity5 as they continue to search for the missing @entity26 on tuesday as well as the @entity7 - 21 , authorities are relying on daily modelling of ocean currents provided by the @entity140 's ( @entity140 ) @entity141 and @entity142 , which may give clues about how any surface debris may have dispersed			1
' people are spending a lot of their time at the moment looking at the daily models to provide updates , ' @entity145 , the @entity140 's principal marine scientist , told @entity122			0
' the winds , ocean currents , the time and cyclones passing through , they can all have an influence on what the ocean currents are doing and the model has to be able to capture all of this , ' @entity145 said			0
@entity75 has hinted that the search , although not yet over , may already rank as the most expensive in aviation history , although authorities are yet to put even an approximate price tag on it .			0

@entity7 - 21 drone completes 16 hour mission 2,000km off @entity11 coast
data is now being analysed for any traces of the missing jet liner
depth of search area is at the limit of @entity37 's operational capabilities
two previous missions had to be aborted due to technical problems
it is now over 40 days since the flight with 239 people on board disappeared
*initial* analysis of data showed it had not detected anything significant
