the @entity1 's attempt to ' retrain ' 20,000 cops has been branded a ' complete waste of time ' by many officers on the force			1
so dull is the training , that some police officers say they are falling asleep during the three - day long course which consists mainly of eight - hour long lectures			1
instead of practical , hands - on training , some cops complain they are being given unrealistic solutions to dangerous problems - such as being told to ' take a deep breath ' and ' close their eyes ' when dealing with angry people			2
good cop , bad cop : the $ 35 million ' smart policing ' program to retrain @entity24 cops in the aftermath of @entity27 's death last july has been branded a big flop by a high - ranking @entity1 official the $ 35million course which was introduced last december by mayor @entity31 and police commissioner @entity32 in a bid to address criticism of the illegal chokehold maneuver that resulted in the death of the father - of - six			1
once officers have completed the three - day ' smart policing ' course they are asked to fill out a survey , but the results have been less than impressive , according to reports			1
one cop who sat through two full - day programs called them ' not realistic ' and ' pretty silly			1
' at one point during the lectures , the cop said , those in attendance were given breathing exercises to learn how to calm down — even when facing someone who could pose a threat to their safety			0
' they said if you find yourself in a situation that 's getting heated , take a step back , close your eyes and take a deep breath , ' he told the @entity63			0
' that 's pretty funny — that i would close my eyes in a tense situation			0
' another cop called the lectures ' smoke and mirrors ' to appease the public			0
' they want you to stop and think about everything before you do anything , but a lot of times cops have to make a split - second decision , and they do n't have the luxury of stopping and thinking , ' the cop said			2
a high - ranking @entity1 official – who was n't named - told the @entity63 that of the 2,000 surveys reviewed eight out of every ten officers have branded the exercise a waste of time			1
safety measures : @entity1 police commissioner @entity32 , right , introduced the new training scheme after the @entity27 death , alongside @entity24 mayo @entity31 , left the problem says the insider is that the course involves too little practical training and two days of boring eight - hour lectures that have caused some cops to fall asleep			1
' it 's three days , it 's boring and there 's no real tactics , ' said the @entity63 's source			0
' they 're not putting them in scenarios			0
cops felt they would get more tactical training in light of the @entity27 case			1
' the retraining is taking place at the brand - new , $ 750 million @entity114 in @entity115			2
the disappointment comes because the there appears to very little ' hands - on , quality training on how to deal with a hostile prisoner or arrestee , ' according to the @entity63			2
' it 's three days , it 's boring and there 's no real tactics , ' he said			0
' they 're not putting them in scenarios			0
cops felt they would get more tactical training in light of the @entity27 case			1
' @entity132 has promised that his retraining program ' will have an impact on millions of people , because every interaction that every officer has with their fellow @entity24 after they are trained again will be different			0
' on day three of the course officers are taught the ' high - low takedown , ' in which two cops apprehend a suspect , one from behind at the legs , the other from the front at the torso			1
mayor @entity31 had ordered a review into training within the department following @entity27 's death			1
redeployed : @entity155 , pictured , tried to introduce a number of controversial new training methods within the @entity1 following the july 2014 death of @entity159 man @entity27 who died as he was arrested the 43 - year - old died after @entity1 officer @entity162 placed him in a illegal chokehold during an attempted arrest on @entity159 on july 17 , 2014			1
officers were attempting to arrest @entity27 because they suspected he had been selling untaxed cigarettes illegally			1
' the training that 's going to happen here in this building will change the future of this city , ' said @entity31 when he introduced the scheme			0
' it will have not just an impact on thousands of people , it will have an impact on millions of people , because every interaction that every officer has with their fellow @entity24 after they are trained again will be different			0
' a deputy nypd commissioner appointed to reform the department in the wake of @entity27 's death has lasted just two months in the job , it was announced at the weekend			1
@entity188 has been moved to a less controversial position after he proposed officers be supplied with breath mints to prevent them from swearing and that protesters should be sprayed with baby oil so they would be easier to remove			2
. a source told the @entity63 : ' he would come up with these wacky ideas			0
we would roll our eyes and move on			0
' @entity155 ordered 10,000 individually wrapped breath mints which were delivered to the @entity1 headquarters building			1
the mints were due to be deployed to individual officers , who would then be instructed to unpeel the wrapper if they felt the urge to swear			2
@entity155 believed that by the time the officer had unwrapped the mint and placed it into his mouth , he would no longer want to curse			0
earlier he had suggested that police should deploy baby oil in situations when protesters link arms and sit down			2
he claimed that the baby oil would prevent the protesters from hanging onto each other and officers with rubber gloves could remove them easily			0
it is understood that @entity155 was removed from his position as deputy commissioner for training following the gaffes and transferred to the personnel department .			0
