by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:32 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 08:17 est , 16 january 2014 @entity3 faces the humiliating prospect of the @entity5 being pushed into third place in may ’s @entity8 elections			1
a damning new poll reveals the @entity10 are on course to come behind @entity12 and the @entity14 @entity13 – the first time it would be outside the top two in election history			1
leading @entity5 backbencher @entity19 today piled pressure on the prime minister , admitting ‘ anything could happen ’ when voters go to the polls			1
the @entity5 are on course to come third in the elections to the @entity27 in may , behind @entity12 and @entity13			1
@entity28 interviewed 1,893 adults for @entity30 on january 14 and 15 @entity13 leader @entity31 predicts he will trigger a political ' earthquake ' by topping the @entity34 elections , while @entity3 is under pressure from @entity36 in the @entity5 party see off the threat of @entity13 @entity13 leader @entity31 has predicted he will trigger an ‘ earthquake ’ in @entity14 politics if his party tops the poll in may when @entity41 are elected to the @entity42			1
mr @entity3 hoped to head off the threat from the @entity36 party with a pro0mise of an in - out referendum if he is prime minister after 2015			1
but a growing @entity5 revolt over @entity8 , demanding a veto for the @entity14 parliament to reject any @entity53 law , has exposed deep divisions on the government benches			0
a new opinion poll today puts @entity12 on course to come first , with @entity13 in second followed by the conservatives			0
a @entity5 rebellion over @entity8 has descended into farce after @entity62 revealed it has never received a controversial letter from rebels			0
@entity3 came under intense pressure at the weekend over claims 95 @entity5 @entity67 had signed a letter calling for the @entity14 government to have the right to veto any @entity72 laws			1
it then emerged that some @entity67 included in the list had not actually signed it			1
treasury select committee chairman @entity76 insisted his name had been included error , and at least six others were also mistakenly added			0
now it has been revealed that the letter was never actually sent to @entity62 , and does not actually exist			1
a response to a @entity84 request by @entity85 said : ' a search of our records has not identified that we have received the letter to which you refer			0
' @entity91 , the @entity5 mp who co-ordinated the letter , said he had passed the names to mr @entity3 's parliamentary aide @entity94 , rather than send an actual letter			1
@entity19 , a standard bearer of the @entity5 right , today refused to say whether he had signed it , but hinted at the confusion			1
asked if had backed the letter , he told @entity101 : ' that is for me to know and the prime minister to know ... or not know			2
' the @entity28 survey for @entity30 put @entity12 on 32 per cent and @entity13 on 26 per cent , with the @entity10 trailing on 23 per cent and @entity106 a distant fourth on 9 per cent			1
if the findings were repeated on may 22 with a uniform swing , they would see @entity5 representation at the @entity27 slashed by 11 to 15 @entity41			2
@entity12 would have 28 ( up 15 ) , @entity13 23 ( up 10 ) , and the @entity106 ' 11 @entity41 would be completely wiped out , according to @entity30 's calculations			2
mr @entity31 has predicted that @entity13 will come first in may : ‘ my ambition and my conviction is we could come first in those @entity8 elections and cause an earthquake in @entity14 politics			0
’ @entity5 strategists are working to limit the damage on mr @entity3 if the party loses @entity41			2
today senior conservative mr @entity19 declined to say whether his party could beat @entity13			2
‘ i think pretty much anything could happen in may , because i think that voters will very much see the @entity8 elections as a referendum on a referendum , ’ he told @entity101 ’s today programme			0
‘ i think it 's very important that the conservative party is defined by the national interest , that we decide we have to have a rational and reasonable debate about our role in @entity8 and our role in the world , and also @entity8 's role in the world			0
‘ one of my biggest problems in this debate is not that it 's just about @entity14 's relationship with @entity8 , it 's where does @entity8 now stand in terms of a very competitive global economy			0
’ but deputy prime minister @entity144 accused the conservatives of engaging in an ' unholy bidding war ' with the @entity14 @entity13 over who can sound most anti-european , which could end in @entity14 leaving the @entity72			2
the @entity106 leader insisted he will not tone down his party 's @entity150 message , following a poll suggesting his meps are set to be wiped out in this year 's elections to the @entity27 , while conservatives slump to third place behind @entity12 and the @entity14 @entity13			1
mr @entity144 said it would be ' economic suicide ' for @entity14 to quit the @entity72 , and that @entity10 and @entity13 were indulging in ' silly political games ' which could put millions of jobs at risk			0
he insisted the @entity106 would campaign as the pro-eu ' party of in '			2
asked how they would vote in a general election , 39 per cent of people backed @entity12 compared to 33 per cent for the @entity10			0
@entity28 interviewed 1,893 adults for @entity30 on january 14 and 15 mr @entity144 added : ' i really genuinely feel that we are getting to the point in the debate where you 've got this unholy bidding war between the @entity5 and @entity13 as to who can sound more breathless in their condemnation of all things @entity8 and , before you know it , this country will find itself outside of the @entity72			2
' i think this will mean we will be less relevant and powerful around the world , we would have less influence around the world			0
' but crucially you would have fewer people in work , because being in @entity8 at the end of the day means being in work			0
i am not going to stand idly by while people play ever more silly political games and jeopardise millions of jobs in this country			0
' however , in a sign that voters will use the @entity8 elections to inflict a bloody nose on the @entity10 , a separate poll on voting intentions for the 2015 general election was very different			0
it put @entity12 on 39 per cent , conservatives 33 per cent and @entity13 12 further behind on 12 per cent and the @entity106 on 10 per cent .			1
