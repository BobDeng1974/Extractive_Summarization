and by far most important reason , he argues , is global warming			0
‘ as makers of the buildings that currently account for 60 per cent of human co2 emissions , we all have a duty to respond with low carbon , low energy solutions , ’ he said during a speech , only six years after the @entity4 was completed			0
mr @entity1 believes glass buildings , such as his @entity4 design , no longer fit into a society where ‘ man - made climate change ’ is a key concern			1
there are currently plans underway to develop a number of other glass buildings in @entity5 , inlcuding the ' can of @entity57 ' and ' the scalpel ' pictured is the @entity4 from the outside ( left ) and from inside ( right )			2
as well as the high cost of the material and unusual building shapes , one of the main concerns is that glass lets out , and lets in , a lot of heat			1
this means that huge amounts of energy are needed for an office to both remain cool and stay warm ‘ lightweight fully glazed buildings , with their hermetically sealed curtain walls and massive reliance on mechanical systems , make no sense in this new world			1

@entity1 says developers should do away with architectural ‘ bling '
one of the main concerns is that glass lets out , and lets in , a lot of heat
huge amounts of energy are needed to maintain heat in a glass office
the danger of glare from glass buildings is also a concern , as seen by the @entity15 building melting cars in @entity5 last summer
