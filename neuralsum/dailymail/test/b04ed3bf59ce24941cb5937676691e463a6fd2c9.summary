' asked if she thought the reports would damage the party 's image or reputation , she said : ' well , i think it 's very clear that @entity115 is n't part of the party and that @entity5 is our spokesperson and these are n't opinions that are held by @entity5 and they 're certainly not opinions that are held by the @entity2 and opinions that are condemned by the @entity2 - but it is @entity5 who is our spokesperson			2
