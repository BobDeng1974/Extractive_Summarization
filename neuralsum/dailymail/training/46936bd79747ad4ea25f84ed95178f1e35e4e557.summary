by @entity0 published : 06:03 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 09:24 est , 4 october 2012 this is the moment a group of shocked tourists were almost flattened by a humpback whale 's enormous tail as it splashed down metres from their boat			1
two of the gigantic creatures were swimming slowly down the northwestern coast feeding on krill when one made a spectacular dive deep into the ocean			2
its large tail fin - known as a fluke - arced out of the sea and over the startled whale watchers ' flimsy rubber dinghy			1
impressive view : the gigantic creature takes a deep dive in the @entity23 while whale watchers gape at the sight incredibly close : three zodiac boats have been following two whales as they travel down the northwestern coast as the animal 's bulky form disappeared into the waves , the relieved tourists were left thanking their lucky stars for their narrow escape from capsizing			1
the humpback , meanwhile , continued its search for crustaceans deep under the surface			0
professional photographer @entity39 , from @entity40 , @entity41 , captured the astonishing moment at the @entity23 from another boat mr @entity39 , a 58 - year - old tour guide , said : ' i 've learned to expect the unexpected - those on the boat were smiling , many cheered and laughed			1
' it 's dinner time ! the enormous creatures , which can weigh up to 48 tons , disappear beneath the surface six or seven minutes in their hunt for krill icy spray : the spectacular dive left the tourists watching in astonishment from their flimsy boat before laughing with relief three zodiac boats are following the humpbacks - which can weigh an amazing 48 tons - as they meander along the coast			2
mr @entity39 added : ' the whales mostly just came to the surface , released their breath with a big blow , then submerged themselves for a minute or so			0
' but after repeating this many times while feeding , they eventually arched their back and dove			0
' whenever i see humpback whales doing this i know that their tail follows them out of the water			2
' and , poof , they were gone for about six or seven minutes			0
when this happens , it 's a real adrenaline rush			0
