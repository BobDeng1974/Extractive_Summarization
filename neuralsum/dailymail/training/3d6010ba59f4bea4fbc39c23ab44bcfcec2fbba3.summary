by @entity0 the problems that have blighted the search for flight mh370 continued today when the only ship left searching the @entity5 was forced to return to port because of a technical problem			1
after authorities agreed that searchers had been looking in the wrong part of the ocean off the west coast of @entity13 , only the @entity15 survey ship @entity16 was left to continue the mission to find the jet			1
but today the vessel was heading for port in @entity13 after it suffered a defect to its multibeam echosounder , @entity13 's @entity19 said in a statement			2
the search for missing @entity26 is expected to continue for at least the next 12 months , with deputy prime minister @entity27 declaring @entity13 is ' committed to the search ' ' the journey is expected to take a couple of days , ' it said , an announcement that added to weeks of frustration in the search for the plane , which vanished on march 8 with 239 passengers and crew			0
the @entity15 vessel was conducting a bathymetric survey - or mapping of the ocean floor - to help experts determine how to carry out the next stage of the search on the previously unmapped ocean seabed			1
as well as this task , the crew were also looking for any signs of the aircraft such as debris or an oil slick			0
the search for the missing @entity26 in the southern @entity5 will continue for up to another year despite recent setbacks			0
a new area of up to 800 kilometres long and 70 kilometres wide is expected to be selected for the new search zone			0
the @entity15 survey ship @entity16 , has already begun mapping the new ocean floor and is expected to continue for the next three months			1
a @entity15 survey ship has already begun mapping of the new ocean floor , expected to continue for the next three months the data collected by the ship , which is conducting a bathymetric survey , will determine if new search equipment can be safely towed to the area 's sea floor to search for the airline which went missing on march 8 carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew			1
it will also help determine water depths , enabling selection of scanning technology that will be needed for a fresh underwater search			2
the previous two - month - long search for the airline drew doubts from @entity77 sources earlier this week when the acoustic ' pings ' , which were at the centre of the search , were no longer believed to be coming from the aircraft 's black box			1
the @entity19 confirmed that the previous search area was being abandoned on thursday , and discounted as the resting place of the missing airline			1
' the @entity86 ( @entity86 ) has advised that the search in the vicinity of the acoustic detections can now be considered complete and in its professional judgment , the area can now be discounted as the final resting place of @entity26 , ' the @entity19 said			2
the @entity94 ship @entity95 01 ( pictured ) and a @entity97 vessel , @entity98 6 , are assisting with transporting the survey data for further processing in an interview with the @entity103 on friday however , deputy prime minister , @entity27 , confirmed that the search would continue despite the revelations			1
' we remain as a nation committed to the search , we remain determined to do everything we possibly can to find this aircraft , ' he said			0
' it 's our responsibility to the families of those who are involved , but also to assure the safety of the flying public into the future			0
' with the departure of @entity122 on friday , the new search for the aircraft or any debris is anticipated to begin in august and take up to 12 months			0
possible rings of location : these areas were determined by measuring the time difference between communication messages sent between @entity26 and an @entity129 satellite the @entity122 departed the previous search area on friday after it was revealed that the acoustic ' pings ' whose data the search was based off , were unlikely to have been coming from the plane 's black - box a contracted survey vessel is set to join the @entity15 ship which is currently surveying the area alongside another @entity15 ship @entity95 01 and a @entity97 vessel @entity98 6 which are assisting with transporting the survey data for further processing			1
satellite , radar and and aircraft performance data also continue to be reviewed separately to determine where the plane was most likely to have hit the water			2
seven of the so called ' handshake ' signals sent by the plane to an @entity129 satellite will be reanalyzed , as they are now determined to be the best indication of the planes final location points			0
the @entity161 satellite firm 's data , which contains signals sent by @entity26 will be reanalyzed @entity13 search authorities narrowed the search for the jet after picking up a series of pings near where analysis of satellite data put the last location of the @entity171 , some 1,600km off @entity13 's northwest coast the discovery of the pings on april 5 and 8 was hailed as a significant breakthrough , leading @entity13 search authorities to narrow the search for the jet to some 1,600 km off @entity13 's northwest coast			2
but according to @entity177 , the @entity77 's deputy director of ocean engineering , authorities now almost universally believe the pings did not come from the onboard data or cockpit voice recorders			2
he believes the pings instead came from some other man - made source unrelated to the jetliner which disappeared on march 8 carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew			0
speaking to @entity186 , mr @entity177 said : ‘ our best theory at this point is that ( the pings were ) likely some sound produced by the ship ... or within the electronics of the @entity193			0
’ 850 square kilometres of the ocean floor were scoured in search of the airline , but no sign of wreckage and no debris linked to the plane has ever been picked up despite the most extensive and expensive search effort in aviation history			1
authorities have not ruled out mechanical problems as a cause but say the evidence , including the loss of communications , suggests it was deliberately diverted thousands of kilometres from its scheduled route from @entity211 to @entity212 .			0

only @entity15 vessel left looking for the plane suffered *malfunction*
was forced to return to port in another setback for the search operation
a @entity15 survey ship has begun mapping the new area 's ocean floor
the data will determine the new technology required for the fresh search
the acoustic ' pings ' which the previous search had been based off , are believed to not have come from black box but from search equipment
