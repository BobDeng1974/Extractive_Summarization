by @entity1 reporter published : 15:57 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 09:38 est , 8 october 2013 black market gangs are marauding across the countryside and cashing in on one of the best mushroom crops in years after ' perfect ' growing conditions this summer			1
they are stripping fields of tons of mushrooms which are sold in cut - price deals to traders supplying top hotels and restaurants - leaving the cupboard bare for families who want a few fungi as a mealtime treat			1
the gangs - many thought to be @entity20 - are making a fortune because top @entity23 restaurants will pay over £ 50 a kilo for mushrooms			1
gangs are stripping forests of mushrooms before selling them for up to £ 50 a kilo to traders on the black market the gang behaviour means that the cupboard is bare for families who want to pick their own mushrooms			1
in a year where there has been a bumper harvest professional picker @entity40 , who runs a foraging school in @entity42 to teach people what is safe fungi and what is potentially deadly , said " gangs are going into places like @entity49 and @entity51 forests			1
" they employ a mycologist - a mushroom expert - and strip every fungus in sight			0
" everything not declared edible is then just chucked			0
" the @entity61 allows people to pick up to 1.5kgs of fungi at a time			0
after one of the wettest winters and coldest springs on record , the countryside is displaying one of the most abundant wild harvests seen in years			0
but experts warn pickers to beware because many fungi are poisonous and could even kill if they are eaten			0
they say families should arm themselves with guide books and leave well alone if they are not 100 per cent confident that a fungus is edible			2
under the law you are not stealing if you go into someone 's fields to pick mushrooms although the landowner can turf you off for trespassing on private property			2
provided you immediately leave and do n't act in a threatening or provocative manner , you are not likely to be prosecuted			0
