stricken @entity3 champion @entity2 has developed pneumonia as doctors try to bring him out of the artificial coma that he has been in since december 29 , @entity1 media reported today			1
@entity1 's biggest newspaper , @entity8 , said that @entity2 , 45 , developed the lung infection last week at the @entity10 in @entity11			1
his spokeswoman @entity12 refused to comment on the report , saying only it was ' speculation , and i do not comment on speculation			2
' but @entity8 , which is known to have close contacts to the inner circle of the seven - time world @entity3 champion , said he is being treated with strong antibiotics as his doctors try to ascertain just how dangerous the infection is			1
above , @entity2 is pictured with his wife @entity27 in @entity28 @entity2 , the seven - times formula 1 champion , is being kept under constant scrutiny to detect any movement at all pneumonia is among the greatest life threatening conditions that can afflict people in @entity2 's position			1
the lack of a competent swallowing mechanism can make saliva run into the lungs and trigger the potentially lethal respiratory infection			2
@entity42 , medical director of the @entity43 and @entity44 at the @entity45 in @entity46 told @entity1 's @entity47 only last week ; ' about 30 to 50 per cent of all patients who lie in a coma as long as @entity2 has , get it			1
' @entity8 said it was not known if the ' recovery phase ' - the slow decrease in anaesthetic that has kept @entity2 comatose since his low - speed ski - accident on december 29 in a bid to bring him around - has been interrupted as a result of the infection			1
professor @entity57 , @entity58 at the @entity59 in @entity60 told @entity8 : ' pneumonia is generally a serious and dangerous disease because the body is supplied with less oxygen and is overall very weakened			2
' in someone like @entity2 , who has now been comatose for 46 days since being airlifted from the ski slopes of the @entity70 resort of @entity71 after smashing his head on to a rock , his immune system is seriously weakened and the fear is of multiple organ failure and , ultimately , death			1
professor @entity57 went on : ' one reason may be that the patient can not cough up secretions , which form in the neck and throat , because of a tube in the windpipe through which he breathes			0
a healthy person clears his throat or swallowing several times per minute , usually without realizing it			0
' treatment : @entity2 is currently being kept under anaesthetic at the @entity10 ( above ) in @entity70 either an x-ray or clinical signs - such as high fever - led to the discovery of the infection			1
his lung secretions were analysed to determine the best kind of antibiotics to prescribe to fight it			0
professor @entity57 added : ' often the drug is administered over a seven to ten day period			0
if it works , there is a significant improvement after three or four days and the patient is out of danger			0
but there are also bacteria that are resistant to many antibiotics , that extends the period of danger			0
' he said the comatose racing hero would feel no pain or shortness of breath because of his coma and the drugs he will be receiving			2
so far , there have been no facial or bodily responses to his environment , according to medical sources , as his reflexes are tested on a daily basis			0
he receives food through a tube to his stomach , oxygen via a hose from a machine next to his bed as he still can not breathe independently			0
three times daily his joints and muscles are massaged to prevent atrophy and bed sores			0
the coma suppressed his swallowing reflex , pain perception and his respiratory drive			2
he has to be acutely monitored around the clock during this wake - up phase to see if such things are returning naturally - if at all			1
his blood is also thinned to prevent thrombosis and he is regularly turned and even stood straight up at times to keep blood flowing			0
he lies on a special air - filled mattress to prevent pressure sores and his urinary tract is under constant vigilance because of the danger of waste bacteria entering the bloodstream and causing another potentially fatal infection .			1

it is reported to have developed last week and could be life threatening
