@entity13 followed the family legacy established by his father , who once held the same position before going to prison for official corruption			1
the younger @entity27 accepted a $ 9,000 bribe , and was accused of committing to accept another $ 100,000 , from a man who wanted help securing government approval to open up at least five restaurants in @entity12 's two commercial airports			1
he also accepted home repairs worth $ 40,000 , plus campaign money and sports tickets , in exchange for fixing a zoning case			2
@entity13 , chairman of the @entity42 's police and fire committee , pleaded guilty to corruption charges in 2010 , but he 's itching to get back into city politics the @entity12 way ? former @entity10 gov. @entity46 was sentenced to 14 years in prison 18 corruption convictions , including trying to to auction off president @entity4 's former @entity50 seat he was also fond of setting aside high - paying summer government jobs for his children and paying them out of specialized slush funds			1

two other high - profile @entity9 politicians with serious corruption problems are on primary ballots in @entity10			2
state representative @entity63 is running for re-election – unopposed – despite facing a criminal trial on bank fraud charges stemming from his business activities before he ran for office in 2006			1
he was indicted in late 2012			2
he has been charged with bank fraud for allegedly lying in 2006 on a $ 500,000 application for a line of credit			1

@entity73 is running unopposed in his primary			1
and @entity80 , another @entity9 member of the @entity81 , faces a possible 10 - year prison sentence in connection with a $ 7,000 bribe he allegedly accepted from a man who said he wanted a letter of recommendation for a $ 50,000 grant to open a day care center			1
it was a set - up , though , orchestrated by a campaign worker who was an @entity91 informant : the day - care plan never existed			0
@entity63 ( @entity94 ) and @entity80 ( r ) are running for seats in the state legislature despite clouds of corruption , and both are favored to win @entity100 , a former congressman who went to prison for having sex with a 16 - year - old campaign volunteer , ran for the jailed @entity105 's old @entity1 @entity81 seat in 2012 on a campaign theme of ' redemption , ' but was beaten handily the @entity81 expelled @entity80 in 2012 after criminal charges were laid against him , but months later he won back his seat in a special election			1

democrat @entity112 , the powerful @entity10 house speaker , is supporting both @entity80 and @entity73			0

' that 's how @entity1 works , ' @entity113 said			0
an aide to an @entity10 @entity122 congressman told @entity123 on tuesday that the @entity122 wo n't likely reap political benefits from @entity9 ' lapses			0
' i wish we could take advantage , ' he said , requesting anonymity , ' but @entity10 is a blue state and a universe unto itself			0
it would be easier for us to land on the sun than to get a @entity122 elected to those seats			0
' ' and when you have sitting politicians scratching each others ' backs within their own political machine , it 's hard to throw the bums out			0
' @entity142 , the corrupt former @entity10 governor , spent five years in prison for official corruption before his release in 2013 not every @entity112 in positions of power is helping the ethically challenged candidates , however			1
@entity12 mayor @entity149 is urging voters to shy away from @entity27			1
but the convict is hoping for a clean slate			0
' i believe in a @entity154 that believes in second chances , ' @entity13 told a television audience in december			0
' and i hope that the voters in this [ @entity12 ] district will give me a second chance			1
the situation in @entity10 is ' a terrible indictment ' of the local political culture , added former @entity164 , now a @entity166 professor			0
' there is still a patronage - based political army on the @entity170 of @entity12			2
' @entity10 politicians are famous for playing fast and loose with the public 's trust : @entity175 statistics rank @entity12 as the nation 's most corrupt city			2
since 1976 there have been 1,531 public corruption convictions in that one city , and the problem extends to the state capital of @entity183			2

@entity46 replaced @entity142 gov. @entity142 , who spent five years in federal prison for racketeering			0
the exception that proves the rule ? president @entity4 does n't appear tainted by the smarmy politics in his home town , but ethical challenges of a different kind are dogging him in his second term @entity142 's crime involved taking bribes from unqualified truck drivers in exchange for providing them with hauling licenses while he was @entity10 secretary of state			2
expanding @entity10 ' smarmy legacy , @entity105 , a former state representative and son of the civil - rights leader @entity206 , pleaded guilty last month to misusing $ 750,000 in campaign funds to fund his and his wife 's lavish lifestyles			1
the younger @entity105 's purchases included a $ 43,350 gold @entity212 watch			0
he will be sentenced later this year			0
former @entity10 congressman @entity100 ' corruption chronicles , however , may be the state 's most colorful and disturbing			2
@entity100 went to prison in the 1990s for the statutory rape of a 16 - year - old campaign volunteer , and for bank fraud			1
he was arrested in @entity219 in feburary after allegedly making 100 pornographic films and taking 2,000 naked pictures in hotels			0
mere possession of pornography is a crime in that @entity227 nation			0
but a judge dismissed the charges weeks later and deported him , back to @entity10 .			0
