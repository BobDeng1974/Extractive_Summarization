travellers will be forced to prove they are actually travelling around the country under a new @entity3 crackdown to stop them setting up camps on green belt land			1
under new plans , to be announced by the government next month , travelling communities will be expected to prove that they have moved for two months every year			1
the new draft planning rules state that ' for planning purposes the government believes a traveller should be someone who travels '			1
the new regulations mean travellers will no longer be automatically banned from setting up camp on green belt land , although they must prove they have a ' nomadic ' lifestyle			1
the draft planning rules also state that ' travellers who have given up travelling permanently should be treated in the same way as the settled community , especially regarding sites in sensitive locations , such as in the green belt '			2
under current planning rules , councils must provide land to house traveller communities and the @entity44 2004 also states that authorities must regularly carry out assessments of their accommodation needs			2
mr @entity22 said the new regulations would allow a fairer planning system			2
he told @entity50 's @entity49 : ' the public want to see fair play in the planning system , with planning applications being decided on the basis of their effect on the environment , not who the applicant is			0
' this government will stand firm in allowing councils to safeguard the green belt which prevents urban sprawl and stops the open countryside being covered in concrete			0
' it comes after @entity22 , communities secretary , was found to have ' unlawfully discriminated ' against gipsies by using his powers to personally decide whether they should be allowed to settle on green belt land mr @entity22 had said that travellers would be barred from settling on green belt land to prevent a re-run of battles such as the £ 7million eviction of @entity75 ( pictured ) travellers			1
however , it 's now been overturned however , @entity78 , a spokesman for the @entity79 , disagreed			0
he told the newspaper : ' this is a very , very divisive issue – they are saying if you live on a gipsy site and you do n't go travelling every year , you lose your gipsy status			2
' he said travellers have ' always travelled for work ' and said it is not a nomadic way of life			2
last year , mr @entity22 announced that travellers would be barred from settling on green belt land to prevent a re-run of battles such as the £ 7million eviction of the @entity75 travellers			1
he said he took action because his advice to councils to only allow green belt developments in ' very special circumstances ' was not being followed			0
@entity22 @entity22 took matters into his own hands when travellers set their sights on his constituency			1
as he saw 15 caravans turning off the motorway as he was driving home , he chased them down and confronted about 40 travellers after they pulled on to a cricket pitch in @entity113 , @entity114			0
unhappy with their answers , he then called in the police and local council to deal with them			0
the group were eventually issued with a @entity121 eviction notice and told to leave the field			0
after the incident in 2013 , mr @entity22 said : ‘ after seeing the trouble this has caused i ’ve never felt it more important to protect our green belt land and the communities who live in and around it			1
’ the new rules were intended to prevent a repeat of the forcible clearance of @entity75 , once the @entity136 's largest traveller sites , on green belt land in @entity138 , @entity114			2
it followed a 10 - year legal wrangle with @entity141 , which in 2011 mobilised hundreds of police and bailiffs to clear the site as the residents fought back			0
however , earlier this week mr @entity22 and his department was found to have breached both human rights and equality laws for ' calling in ' cases which would normally be considered by his planning inspectors			1
in a ruling likely to affect many other travellers , mr @entity153 , sitting at the @entity154 in @entity155 , said mr @entity22 was operating a legally - flawed policy of ' recovering ' for his own consideration appeals by travellers who claim there are exceptional circumstances for allowing them green belt sites			1
no attempt had been made by mr @entity22 and his ministers to follow steps required by the @entity166 to avoid indirect discrimination , and ' substantial delays ' had occurred in dealing with the appeals in violation of @entity171 of the @entity172 , the judge said			0
the judge also said that mr @entity22 ' department had ' coined and developed ' a practice in 2013 - 2014 of calling in all , and then a majority , of green belt traveller cases - most involving @entity179 gipsies or @entity181 travellers - ' which discriminated unlawfully against a racial group '			1
following the ruling , planning minister @entity183 said : ' this government makes no apologies for seeking to safeguard green belt protection and trying to bring a sense of fair play to the planning system			0
' the government 's planning policy is clear that both temporary and permanent traveller sites are inappropriate development in the green belt			0
today 's judgment does not question that principle			0
' there are currently an estimated 300,000 gipsies and travellers in the @entity136			0
however , it is believed that only about 40 per cent regularly travel for two months or more every year , meaning many could be affected by the new planning rules .			1

travellers will have to prove they live a ' nomadic lifestyle ' under new rules
will be expected to show that they have moved for two months every year
rules : ' government believes a traveller should be someone who travels '
