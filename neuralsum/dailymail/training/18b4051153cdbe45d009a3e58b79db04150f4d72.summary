by @entity0 published : 08:47 est , 6 june 2012 updated : 11:55 est , 7 june 2012 it was the night that mini burgers and fruitcake were served up at @entity4 and @entity5 made a beeline for her ‘ dream date ’ prince @entity9			1
that ‘ barmy ’ @entity10 clung to prince @entity12 ’s side like a strip of @entity14 – leaving the future king shaken and very stirred – and there was only one question on the lips of the royal party : how on earth do you address @entity23 ’s @entity22 ? admittedly , it was n’t the most raucous after - show party – by rock and roll standards at least – but where else in the world would you get pop royalty sharing a glass of elderflower cordial ( yes , really ) with the real thing ? the morning after the night before : prince @entity9 , @entity34 and @entity12 looked a little bleary eyed at the @entity37 service monday night ’s post @entity39 reception was thrown by the @entity41 and @entity34 , along with prince @entity9 , in the @entity42 and @entity43			1
the heavily gilded @entity42 is familiar to the many thousands of guests to @entity45 who pass through it on their way to the garden			0
it was originally intended as a part of @entity53 's private apartments - to be the @entity54 - but it was never fitted up as such			0
instead , it has become a room for entertaining and is where @entity57 holds the arrival lunch for a visiting @entity59 at the start of a state visit			0
star line - up : @entity23 ’s @entity22 , @entity10 and @entity5 attended the after - party it leads off the @entity43 , a blood - red hallway stretching the width of the palace which is the first sight many get of the interior of the @entity57 ’s official residence			1
although the event was ostensibly for the younger royals – led by @entity76 and @entity9 along with their cousins , @entity71 and @entity72 – some of the ‘ oldies ’ also popped in , including the @entity41 and @entity78 and his wife , the @entity79			1
according to several of those present , the party was very much ‘ in the palace mould ’ – no seating or music and relatively formal			1
‘ but given the huge range of celebrities who were there and the fact that they could let their hair down without having to worry about a photographer jumping out from the nearest antique , the atmosphere was really lively and relaxed , ’ said one			1
@entity22 tweets a picture with prince @entity12 at the jubilee party butlers dressed red and black livery served champagne ‘ like it was water ’ as well as soft drinks including elderflower cordial for those who chose not to partake			1
canapés including fish cakes , smoked salmon blinis , mini hamburgers and small bowls of pasta and risotto , made by the @entity4 kitchen under head chef @entity111 , were also handed round , also including , oddly , tiny slivers of fruit cake			0
every star who performed at the concert was present including four knights – sir @entity116 , sir @entity117 , sir @entity118 ( accompanied by his daughters @entity120 and @entity121 ) and sir @entity122 – as well as @entity123			0
@entity124 rubbed shoulders with classical pianist @entity126 while @entity128 judge @entity22 ( who is apparently tiny in real life ) apparently made it his mission to meet as many members of @entity134 royalty as he could			1
the singer tweeted obsessively throughout the night – even posting a picture of himself and prince @entity12 , who was clutching a glass of champagne , at the party with the message : ‘ just realized i am the shorter @entity22			1
’ he also posted several pictures of himself posing with guardsmen at the palace gates accompanied by the message # iambritish			1
‘ no - one actually knew what to call him , though , it was hilarious			0
did you address him as @entity22 , @entity12 or @entity151			2
i.am ? ’ joked one guest			2
prince @entity12 was also a focus of attention for eccentric signer @entity10 , who had earlier performed her entire song , @entity155 , circling a hula - hoop around her waist			2
a source said : ‘ she just would n’t leave his side and kept introducing him to all the celebs , saying ‘ have you met prince @entity12 ? have you met @entity12 ? ’ it was getting a bit embarrassing and the prince actually looked rather uncomfortable			2
’ other guests , however , described @entity166 , who was accompanied by her elderly mother , as ‘ fantastic ’			2
‘ she was still wearing her hat and towered over everyone in the room			0
she was hugely eccentric and hugely entertaining			0
just fantastic , ’ said one			0
singletons @entity5 and prince @entity9 were also believed to have chatted at length – an interesting pairing as @entity9 recently admitted he ‘ fancied ’ the @entity175 star while @entity5 told an interviewer : ' i love prince @entity9			1
actually , i had a dream last night i married prince @entity9 and was a real - life princess			0
and @entity182 was my father - in - law			0
’ according to guests singer @entity183 was ' the life and soul of the party ' aides discreetly declined to reveal how long they chatted for , however			0
the star of the night was , however , singer @entity183 , who was ‘ the life and soul of the party ’			0
‘ everyone wanted to meet him and he wanted to meet everyone ! ’ said a fellow guest			0
he was also ( as was the ever - present @entity22 ) particularly excited about meeting the @entity57 earlier – indeed according to the concert organiser , @entity196 ’s @entity197 , most of the @entity200 stars virtually had it written into their performance contracts that they would get to meet the monarch			1
sources said that @entity34 left the festivities a little earlier than the rest of the royals , who were still partying hard at 1.30am			1
the party finally wrapped up well into the early hours – which may account for the bags some of the young royals had under their eyes at @entity213 ’s a few hours later			1
‘ it was a great night – i think because of where they were , all the stars were very relaxed			2
it was a fabulous end to a remarkable night , ’ said one equally baggy - eyed reveller .			2
