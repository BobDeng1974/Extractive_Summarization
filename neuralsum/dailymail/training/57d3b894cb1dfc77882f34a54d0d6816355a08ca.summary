an @entity2 clinic is treating transgender children as young as 12 with drug therapies to prepare them for a sex change , it has been revealed			1
more than 20 youngsters with ' gender dysphoria ' are being prescribed hormone blockers by doctors at the @entity10 in north @entity11			1
the treatment halts the onset of puberty - preventing children from developing the sexual characteristics of the gender they were born			1
controversial : the @entity10 in north @entity11 is prescribing hormone blockers to children as young as 12 the clinic started offering the medication in 2011 as part of a study to determine whether transgender children could benefit from starting treatment earlier than in the past , according to @entity25			1
it was initially deemed controversial due to the patients ' ages - with critics arguing that the youngsters lacked the ability to consent to the therapies			0
however , since then , the clinic has received a staggering 142 referrals of children aged 11 to 15 from parents and carers			0
dr @entity37 , director of the @entity10 's gender identity service , said she plans to continue offering the treatment to youngsters after the study culminates in april			2
fight : transgender @entity42 , 12 , was born as a girl called @entity45 , right			2
last month , he vowed to fight a doctor 's decision to ban him from taking hormone blockers , which halt the onset of puberty ' thirty - five [ children ] so far have been accepted into the early intervention study , about half of these born as girls and half as boys , of whom 23 are already being treated with hormone blockers , ' she told @entity25			1
' another 12 have gone forward but are not yet in treatment , perhaps because they are still too early in puberty			2
' once they have reached 16 years old , children are given two options : to halt the hormone blockers - causing them to stay the same gender - or to take ' cross-sex ' hormones , which change their body to the opposite gender			1
at the age of 18 , the @entity10 is able to refer them for a sex change operation			2
upset : speaking on this morning last month , @entity42 - pictured with his mother , @entity71 , 48 - said he started to cry when he was told he could n't undergo hormone therapy the clinic 's approach is a sharp contrast to most doctors ' surgeries in the @entity78 , where children under 16 years old are generally refused hormone blockers			1
however , pro-treatment campaigners argue that , by their 16th birthday , most youngsters have experienced the onset of puberty - making it harder for them to change gender			2
. dr @entity37 said it was ' better ' for children not to have gone through puberty before ' transitioning '			2
but she added : ' you are asking someone aged as young as 11 to make big decisions about their adult life and identity			0
we have to be very careful to keep options open			0
' beauty queen : miss @entity100 finalist @entity99 became the youngest person in the world to undergo transgender surgery last month , 12 - year - old transgender @entity42 vowed to fight a doctor 's decision to ban him from taking hormone blockers			1

he plans to take testosterone at the age of 16 , before undergoing gender reassignment surgery at the age of 18			0
in the meantime , he wants to take hormone blockers to prevent the onset of puberty and the release of female hormones in his body			1
however , despite undergoing numerous psychological and hormone tests , his gp has refused to prescribe them because she was unsure of the long - term effects - adding : ' any clinical decision i make always gives consideration to every aspect of the patient 's wellbeing '			0
speaking on this morning with his mother , @entity71 , 48 , @entity42 said : ' i did n't like it , i started to cry when she told me			0
' mrs @entity137 added : ' what so many people do n't understand is that i feel it 's far more dangerous for @entity42 to not have these hormone blockers			1
' the things he has to go though , the emotions and the torment is slowly bringing him down and down			0
' @entity42 is one of a growing number of @entity78 children with gender dysphoria , a condition whereby you feel have been physically assigned the wrong gender at birth			0
in 2009 , aged 16 , @entity99 became the youngest person in the world to undergo transgender surgery - having travelled to @entity155 aged 12 to receive hormone blockers			1
last year , as a 19 - year - old woman , @entity99 made history once again by becoming the first transgender miss @entity100 finalist			0
