by @entity0 for @entity1 unable to play his way into the side , overlooked for a place among @entity7 ’s elite corps of vice-captains , @entity2 will still be contributing to the @entity10 cause at @entity11			1
for starters , he ’ll be answering @entity15 rookie @entity14 ’s invitation for a chat , the veteran of the @entity18 – and the @entity19 at @entity20 before that – glad to pass on the benefits of his own experience			1
when the big transatlantic bash tees off , meanwhile , @entity2 will be right there in the throng – shouting himself hoarse in support of @entity28 and the boys			1
@entity2 has missed out on a place in this year 's @entity32 @entity15 team @entity2 , pictured at @entity33 , will still be cheering the side on from the crowd @entity36 plays a shot during the @entity38 on september 6 , 2014 in @entity39 the former @entity41 champion , a huge @entity42 fan who aims to bring some of his @entity44 verbals to @entity45 , did n’t hold back in expressing his disappointment when @entity7 left him out of his backroom staff			1
ask him now how he feels about being on the outside of the ropes and , candidly , he replies : ‘ @entity50 great			1
’ the lure of a @entity15 on home soil is too strong to resist , though			1
so he ’ll watch the opening day ’s action on tv , before throwing himself into the role of supportive on - site spectator			1
‘ i ’m heading down friday night , ’ he revealed			1
‘ the guy that we ’ve got our car deal with , @entity61 , has a big house , so me and my wife are going down to spend the weekend with him			1
‘ so we ’re going to be there – i ’ll be walking around with @entity28 , hopefully on the saturday if he ’s playing , then definitely on the sunday			2
‘ it will feel a bit weird			2
obviously i wanted to play but i ca n’t , so i just have to look forward to watching			2
i ’m still looking forward to going and enjoying a great event			2
‘ it ’ll be a fantastic atmosphere and there are about 10 of us staying in this house – all good pals – so it should be great fun			2
‘ i ’ve never been to support at a @entity15			1
it ’s going to be a different experience when i get there – but i ’ll enjoy it , get into it , be pulling for all the boys to play well			2
former @entity41 champion @entity2 was disappointed to miss out on a place in the @entity32 side @entity2 putts during the third round of the @entity38 in front of a picturesque setting ‘ i ’m a pretty big shouter at @entity44 , i get right into it			1
and i ’ll absolutely be giving it all of that at @entity11 ! but people wo n’t recognise me			1
i wo n’t have the usual gear on with all the sponsors ’ badges covering me			2
’ this week , @entity2 is back at @entity95 , where he briefly – but not enjoyably , he says now – served as an on - course commentator for the @entity97			1
before now and his opening tee time in the @entity41 on thursday , he ’ll keep that promise to sit down with @entity14			2
asked to provide a sneak preview of the best advice he might hand down to his fellow @entity101 , @entity2 said : ‘ i remember when i played practice rounds with @entity104 , he said that it all happens pretty quickly			1
‘ you have to , not slow down exactly , but just take your time			2
‘ because everything goes by just so quick in that event			2
‘ walk at normal pace , that ’s important			0
you can find yourself rushing off when you ’re under pressure			0
but @entity28 will know all that			0
he does n’t need me to tell him			0
@entity2 hits a drive during his final round of the @entity38 at @entity117 @entity2 plays a shot on the 18th hole during day 2 of the @entity120 on september 12 , 2014 in @entity121 ‘ he ’ll love it			1
there are very few moments when you think : “ oh , i ’m not so sure about this ”			0
‘ there are a couple of moments when you ’ll get that			0
but it goes pretty quickly			0
‘ no , he ’ll just have a ball of a time			0
i ’m gutted i ’ m not there – but delighted for him , obviously			0
‘ i ’m sure we ’re going to see each other this week for a bite to eat			0
he does n’t need me to tell him what ’s what – but anything he wants to run past me is fine , obviously			0
‘ it ’s just whatever he wants to ask			0
he asked if it was all right to have a sit - down and pick my brains			1
it ’s not an issue			0
‘ you ’ve got to experience the nerves of a @entity15 to know what it ’s like			1
but he ’ll deal with it			0
‘ he ’s been in pressure situations before , he ’s won tournaments			0
when he was defending in @entity157 , he played with @entity158 and @entity159			0
he knows what it ’s all about			0
‘ having said that , he has to magnify those experiences by 10 , just to get an idea of the feelings he ’ll experience			0
‘ but the crowd will help			0
he ’ll know that most of them are there to watch him			1
and the first time he plays will be amazing			0
the place will be bouncing			1
