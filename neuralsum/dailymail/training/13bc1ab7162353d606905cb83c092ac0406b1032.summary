@entity0 insists blame for @entity3 ’s poor season should lie with him - but the @entity4 is adamant he has no regrets about letting @entity6 leave the club			1
it was quite a claim when set against the dreadful , rudderless defensive performances that have followed @entity6 ’s summer departure for @entity11 after nine years in north @entity12			1
what the club have lost in both a leader and centre - half could be thrown into sharp relief when @entity3 play at @entity11 , even if they do have the comfort of knowing their worst form has been reserved for games at @entity22			1
@entity0 blames himself for @entity3 's poor start to the @entity25 season the @entity3 boss said that he has no regrets about allowing @entity6 to join @entity11 this summer @entity3 were beaten 2 - 1 by @entity28 at @entity22 in their last @entity25 game it ’s at home where four of their five @entity25 defeats have occurred , though aside from geography it is clear that fundamental problems exist within a defence that concedes an average of 1.5 goals per game			1
perhaps that ought to make @entity0 question the decision to let @entity6 , 31 , leave shortly after his own arrival , but the @entity3 head coach said : ‘ it was not only my decision – we had a chat with @entity6 about the situation , and we agreed the best thing for him was to join @entity11			1
‘ we were transparent with him all the way , and we had a very good relationship – we always talked face to face , but i do n’t ( regret letting him go ) because it was n’t only down to me			0
‘ i understand the situation with @entity6 because i played for more than 10 years with @entity57 before i decided to leave			2
like @entity6 , i was the captain and i shared the decision to leave with the club			0
@entity0 has overseen @entity3 ' worst start to a league campaign since @entity61 was in charge in 2008 centre back @entity6 spent nine years at @entity3 and captained the side last season ‘ it is always sad , for the people who have been close to you for 10 years , when you part because you share emotions together			1
‘ but this is professional football , and when you decide to do something different , you need to look forward			0
’ certainly looking backwards will offer little encouragement			0
@entity0 reiterated his belief that his players lack the correct ‘ mentality ‘ , though he was clear that he must take responsibility for sitting 12th			2
he said : ‘ i have no complaint with the players			0
i complain with me , with myself , because i need to give them more tools to play better			0
’ @entity0 attempted to play down suggestions that @entity83 is unhappy , but the @entity85 centre - half is understood to be considering leaving the club after finding his opportunities limited under the @entity4 .			2

@entity0 accepts responsibility @entity3 's poor form
spurs are currently 12th in the league with *14* points after 11 games
@entity6 left the club after nine years to join @entity11 this summer
@entity0 has no regrets about selling the centre back despite @entity3 's defensive *frailty*
