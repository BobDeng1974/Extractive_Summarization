despite ink covering 90 per cent of @entity8 's body , he thinks he is the perfect candidate to become president in his home country of the @entity11			1
mr @entity8 hopes to replace @entity12 , who has been president of the @entity11 since 2003 , and has already mounted an election campaign			1
grand designs : artist and drama professor @entity8 wants to become the @entity11 's head of state his appearance might give an unappealing impression			1
however the 53 - year - old is actually a drama professor at a prestigious @entity11 university , a talented painter and a successful opera composer			1
he also graduated from law school and has a doctorate in law but opted against a legal career because of the former communist regime			2
now mr @entity8 , from @entity29 , is turning his hand to politics and has started a campaign to become the next president of the @entity11			1
the wannabe politician , running as an independent , is travelling around his homeland in a bid to get the 50,000 signatures required before the end of the year to run for office			2
and by monday - after only his first weekend of campaigning - he had already racked up 8,777 signatures			2
contender : mr @entity8 hopes to replace current @entity11 president @entity12 ( pictured ) he describes himself as a man ' with a sense of humour and an inner relationship to nature who never ceases to learn and expand his knowledge and skills '			1
the divorced father , whose @entity53 campaign page has more than 23,000 likes , is confident the public will take him seriously and that he has a genuine chance of becoming the country 's first publicly - elected president			1
despite his intimidating image , his politics are moderate , promoting tolerance , human rights , democracy and encouraging the search for alternative energy sources			2
he told the @entity66 said : ' politics , politicians and the state have become alienated from the people			0
citizens are frustrated , and i fear radicalisation			0
' politicians and the state are not the same thing			0
they do not own the state , but should be its responsible stewards , hired by the owners once every four years			0
' those owners are the citizens of this country i think i have a chance , not only because i am non-partisan , but as a person without a tarnished political past and an individual free of links to financial circles and their interests			0
' gathering at least 50,000 signatures for my nomination will be a success , and it will bring hope			0
it would also be a strong signal that society is finally waking up			0
' i understand i can be hard to read for many people , because until now i 've only expressed my views through my art. now i have to formulate them in a decoded language			0
