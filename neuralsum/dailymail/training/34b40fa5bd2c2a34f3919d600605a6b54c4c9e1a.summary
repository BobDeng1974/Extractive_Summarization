a mother - of - two whose cancer left her bed - bound for two years found a way to stay positive - by writing erotic fiction			1
@entity5 , 56 , was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2008 and was operated on immediately after doctors found a tumour smothering her whole kidney			1
after having the affected kidney removed , @entity5 was left with a number of other health problems which confined her to her bed for several years			1
@entity5 was left house bound for years after being diagnosed with kidney cancer , in a bid to keep herself busy she turned her hand to erotic fiction the care worker from @entity20 was forced to quit her job as she was in too much pain to leave the house			1
in a bid to distract herself from her poor health , she picked up @entity27 's hit book @entity28			1
it was while reading the bestseller that @entity5 decided that she fancied having a go at writing her own naughty novel , adding that she thought she could show @entity27 a thing or two			1
' i was doing it for myself , to begin with , because of a desire to do something shocking			2
i started the novel and had written 50,000 words within the first month			2
it 's a bloody thriller full of sex and revenge , so i had a lot of fun writing it			1
' her book it 's a @entity47 has proved popular online and in bookshops selling hundreds of copies - as well as helping @entity5 put her cancer battle behind her			1
as well as her writing providing her solace , @entity5 found her husband to be a great support throughout her cancer battle			1
@entity5 was diagnosed with cancer in 2008 and although she did n't have to have chemotherapy her operation meant she was bed - bound for most of the time @entity5 's husband @entity58 suggested she started writing after reading his wife 's diaries @entity5 married second husband @entity58 , 57 , in 2008 and they had just begun decorating their new home together when @entity5 began to experience pain in her side			1
' after my operation , i found i could n't move or walk or do anything for a couple of years , so through sheer boredom i decided to write something			1
' i thought if @entity27 could do it , then i could do it			2
i had n't read it cover to cover but i could n't believe how popular it was			2
and i 'd heard it was n't especially well written so i thought i could do better			0
' @entity5 quickly found that writing her novel was just what she needed to keep her positive and made progress very quickly			1
' they removed the kidney the following month and thankfully i did n't have to have chemotherapy because they 'd found the tumour just in time			1
it was a slow - growing cancer , but i had mri scans every few months to ensure the cancer had n't spread			1
' despite remaining cancer - free , @entity5 has been left with numerous health problems including disequilibrium syndrome , which she nicknames ' old lady syndrome ' as it leaves her with loss of balance and severe fatigue			1
with @entity5 housebound since leaving her job as a care worker in 2009 , it was @entity58 - a car maintenance officer for the police - who suggested she take up writing			1
@entity5 bought @entity103 and decided that she could do better than author @entity27 @entity5 occasionally includes her own sexual experiences with husband @entity58 ( pictured ) in her novels the couple were heartbroken when a routine mri scan revealed the tumour covering her whole kidney			1
@entity5 , who has two grown - up children from her previous marriage , says the cancer came as a massive shock to them both			1
' @entity115 is my soulmate			0
we were like any loved - up newlyweds that year despite being in our late 40s - we both felt we had a new lease of life having married each other			0
' after our house move i started getting a lot of pain and discomfort in my side so my gp referred me for an mri scan			0
' i do n't think at that point they were actually looking for cancer , just attempting to find out what was wrong			1
but it turned out my tumour was quite advanced and had covered my whole right kidney			1
' she said : ' some days i could n't leave the house as my mobility was so badly affected			0
i needed something to take my mind off the pain and boredom			1
i 'd let @entity115 read some of my old diaries a few months earlier and he thought they were great , so the novel was all his idea			0
before starting it 's a @entity149 experimented with several other genres before deciding on a more sensual story line			2
' i dabbled with other genres and wrote some poetry , and in 2011 i started working on my erotic novel			0
@entity5 says she has received hugely positive feedback about her book and even her children have read it ' the eroticism in it 's a secret is mostly wishful thinking , like me wanting to join the @entity162			1
i put that in as a little teaser for myself			0
i had a lot of fun with it			0
' i was shocked at myself that i would put such raunchy details into the book			0
i was trying to write things that would help my readers feel all the different pleasures of having sex , the same that i felt writing it			0
' as well as fantasies , @entity5 included a number of experiences from her own sex life in the novel			1
' certain scenes do reflect mine and @entity58 's relationship			2
but i would n't put everything in the book , as some things are private			0
i do draw the line			0
' thankfully @entity58 does n't mind me including bits about him , although of course he 's the only one who knows which bits they are			2
' @entity5 added that her and @entity58 have always enjoyed an erotic relationship and the novel has helped to unite them further			1
@entity5 has now sold hundreds of copies of her book it 's a secret and is currently writing a sequel ' i once painted @entity115 in the nude so i suppose we 've always been a very sensual couple			1
i wanted to put the painting up on the wall but he would n't let me			0
' the novel has brought us closer together and although he ca n't believe it was me who wrote it , he is so proud			0
apparently i am sexier than i have ever been ! ' @entity5 says that her children have been equally supportive of her writing : ' i have grown - up children and my daughter has read it 's a @entity47 and thinks it 's great			1
she loves what i 'm doing			0
' the mother - of - two says that she has seen the landscape of sexual liberation completely change and that we are lucky to be able to enjoy books like hers			0
' women have always been suppressed when it comes to sex			0
you are a slut if you sleep around , or not a very nice woman if you want sex			0
' but women are more accepted now			0
if you want sex , go out and get it			0
if you just want a one - night stand it is acceptable and that 's how it should be			2
in my mum 's day you could have been stoned for reading a book like this			2
equality is n't quite there , but we are working on it			0
' @entity5 published it 's a @entity47 in 2012 through self - publishing firm @entity236 @entity237 and it 's available to buy in major bookshops and online			1
the book 's blurb states : ' if you want a fast moving compelling , bloody sexual erotic experience , then come inside this fantasy			2
it is full of want and need , passion and hatred			0
mostly , revenge is sweet but what comes with the before and after ? feelings of so many wants , needs , mistrust and rage			2
read me , i 'm yours			0
' @entity5 says she has been thrilled with the positive response her novel has received so far and plans to continue writing			1
' the book is gradually becoming well - known			0
i do book signings when i can			0
it 's become more and more popular and i 've had people contact me on @entity265 demanding that i write a sequel , so that 's what i 'm in the middle of now			2
the sequel 's called it 's a @entity270			2
' @entity271 keeps me sane			0
i have just been signed off work for another two years , but knowing i have this to work on helps me to stay positive			2
i 've managed to create something fun and exciting out of a very hard situation - excuse the pun ! '			0
