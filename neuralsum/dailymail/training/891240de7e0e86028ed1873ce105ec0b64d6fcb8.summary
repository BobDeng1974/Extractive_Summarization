by @entity0 published : 19:08 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 11:03 est , 24 may 2013 there were dramatic scenes in court last night as the judge declared a mistrial over the sentencing of @entity7 after the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict over whether or not she should be executed for murdering her ex-boyfriend			1
the jury was dismissed from the courtroom after spending five months on the case , and while they did decide that she was guilty of the premeditated murder of @entity7 , they could not decide whether she should spend life in prison or be put to death			1
the next step in the lengthy trial will now come on july 18 , when an entirely new jury panel is determined and tasked with delivering the final verdict in the case			1
in tears : @entity7 looked frightened before the jury 's non-decision was handed down , but her composure did not change dramatically after she realized that she was not being sentenced to death heartbroken : @entity7 's relatives , including his sister @entity31 ( right ) were a constant presence at the trial and they were moved to tears when they heard that it would drag on for more months the scene in the @entity38 , @entity40 courtroom on thursday afternoon - when the jury came back to the judge with their inability to agree - was not one of relief			1
arias herself looked upset and began crying , though not necessarily tears of joy			0
@entity50 's siblings , who have been a constant presence throughout and have all uprooted their lives in @entity53 to focus on the trial , were all crying as well			0
one female juror was at least sympathetic to them , and she was seen mouthing the word ' sorry ' toward the @entity50			0
judge @entity58 , who showed some tough love to the jury yesterday , was very complimentary to them today			2
' this was not your typical trial			0
you were asked to perform some very difficult duties , ' she said			0
mistrial : @entity7 reacts as the jury indicates it has not been able to reach a decision on the death penalty the jury began deliberating tuesday , and on wednesday afternoon they told the judge that they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict			1
she ordered the jurors to go back and talk more until they came to a decision , but that was still not enough time as they came back later yesterday afternoon still at an impasse			2
the new jury will not have any power to change her guilty conviction , and they will be solely tasked with determining how she will ' pay ' for the first degree murder			1
the decision follows a trial that has staggered on for five months over the 2008 slaying of @entity7 , @entity87 ' on - again off - again boyfriend who she killed in his home in 2008			1
she stabbed him nearly 30 times , slit his throat , and shot him			0
fearful : @entity87 was surrounded by her legal team , and her relatives were not in the room though they had been regularly fixtures at the trial through much of the five months even for the most fastidious of court followers who have developed a sense of who @entity87 is over the past five months of the trial , her behavior in the past week has been confusing as she gave conflicting statements about her desire thoughts on a possible death sentence			1
immediately after her guilty verdict was handed down two weeks ago , she granted a local news station an interview where she said that she was ' in shock ' and that she would rather be given the death penalty as opposed to a life sentence in prison			1
speaking to the local @entity118 affiliate @entity117 , @entity87 said that she would ' prefer to die sooner than later			0
' â€˜ longevity runs in my family , and i do n't want to spend the rest of my natural life in one place			2
i 'm pretty healthy , i do n't smoke and i 'll probably live for a long time so that 's not something that i am looking forward to			2
' i believe death is the ultimate freedom and i 'd rather have my freedom as soon as i can get it			0
' waiting game : now the next jury will be impaneled on july 18 and this second portion of the trial - where the jury needs to determine the punishment for @entity87 - will be done for a second time those comments prompted courthouse officials to order that she be placed in a psychological hold and on suicide watch , which inevitably delayed the second portion of the sentencing - where jurors were forced to decide if the murder was especially aggressive			1
during the ensuing testimony , called the aggravation portion of the trial , jurors heard from both sides who were able to call witnesses arguing that she should and should n't be forced to die , respectively			1
when she addressed the court in her own defense , she she pledged , if allowed to live , to donate her hair to cancer patients and start a prison recycling program			0
' i have made many public statements that i would prefer the death penalty to life in prison , ' @entity87 told jurors			2
in each of those cases , ' i lacked perspective , ' she said			0
' until very recently i could not imagine standing before you all and asking for you to give me life , ' she said			0
' but as i stand here now i can not in good conscience ask you to sentence me to death			0

the jury could not come to a unanimous decision about whether to execute @entity7 or to sentence her to life in prison
they were the group that spent five months listening to *graphic* *details* about the 2008 murder of @entity7
now a new jury must be called and they will be forced to decide what @entity7 ' sentence should be for the premeditated murder
the new jury will not be able to *override* the guilty verdict
move draws out the case longer as the new jury wo n't be called until july
