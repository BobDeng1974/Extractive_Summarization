by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:04 est , 16 march 2012 updated : 19:31 est , 16 march 2012 ticket to ride : @entity3 , pictured with his wife @entity4 , is chauffeured between @entity5 and @entity6 after his @entity8 duties at a cost of £ 15,000 to the @entity10 you might expect someone earning a reputed £ 2million to be able to foot his own commuting bills			1
but it seems the @entity10 has other ideas – and is splashing out more than £ 15,000 a year to cover @entity3 ’s travel to work			2
after finishing each @entity8 show , the presenter has a chauffeur waiting to drive him from the @entity22 ’s new studios in @entity23 to his home in @entity6			1
the @entity10 also pays for the former @entity27 captain ’s first - class train ticket from @entity6 to @entity5 to begin filming each week			1
this is despite @entity28 , 51 , taking home one of the highest salaries at @entity22			2
the broadcaster ’s official policy is not to pay travel expenses for freelance presenters who live in the @entity35 and work in @entity23 – meaning other hosts , such as @entity39 ’s @entity38 , have to meet these costs themselves			0
but @entity3 ’s contract was signed before the @entity22 ’s move to the @entity5 site was confirmed			0
it is understood to have guaranteed to provide his travel to and from the programme			0
since the move , however , @entity3 ’s 200 - mile chauffeur - driven trip home from work can take up to four hours and costs around £ 350			0
he makes the journey 40 times a year , leaving his employer with an annual bill of about £ 14,000			0
his rail tickets are thought to cost a further £ 1,500 every 12 months			0
longer commute : match of the day was transferred from @entity6 to the @entity61 development ( above ) in @entity23 last november tied in : the former @entity27 captain 's contract , which was signed before the move to the @entity61 development in @entity23 ( above ) , is understood to have guaranteed travel to and from the programme the @entity10 insists the first - class fare is justified to ensure the presenter ’s privacy , and claims the chauffeur - driven car is necessary because filming finishes after the last @entity6 - bound train has left @entity5			1
but @entity75 , chairman of the @entity76 , said : ‘ it is very difficult to see how the @entity10 can justify this given the amount @entity3 is paid , particularly if people on much lower salaries have to pay transport costs themselves			1
’ the revelation has also irritated staff members who have uprooted their families and moved to the @entity85 to keep their jobs			0
in other work : the @entity8 presenter opens @entity28 's lunches in @entity6 on march 12 to unveil the answer to @entity92 ' three mystery flavours one said : ‘ why are people who are being paid such a vast sum of money already not being told that if you want to work for the @entity10 , you have to move near your place of work ? ' there is a feeling so - called talent get things other members of staff do n’t get			1
’ two years ago , the @entity105 revealed that the @entity10 was spending thousands of pounds each year on taxis to take @entity8 pundits @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 from the studios in @entity6 to their homes in the @entity113 and @entity85			1
not so privileged : the broadcaster 's policy is not to foot the travel expenses of freelance presenters such as @entity39 's @entity38 ( above ) expensive business : the @entity105 revealed two years ago how the @entity10 was spending thousands each year on taxis for @entity8 pundits @entity108 ( left ) , @entity109 ( second right ) and @entity110 ( right ) the show was transferred from @entity6 to the @entity61 development in @entity23 last november			2
the @entity10 declined to comment on current travel arrangements for its pundits , but a spokesman said : ‘ the @entity10 is obliged to honour any existing contract that stipulates that it meet the cost of travel and we always ensure that the costs are kept as low as possible			2
’ @entity3 ’s agent said : ‘ we have no comment whatsoever			0
