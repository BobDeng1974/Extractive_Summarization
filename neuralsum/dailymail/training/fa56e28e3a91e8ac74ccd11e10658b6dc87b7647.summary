by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 08:52 est , 5 december 2013 updated : 04:27 est , 6 december 2013 employers will no longer have to pay national insurance contributions when they take on workers under the age of 21			2
@entity7 announced that what he called the ‘ jobs tax on young people ’ would be abolished by 2015 in a bid to cut the stubbornly high level of youth unemployment			1
the announcement follows the introduction earlier this year of the @entity16 , which cuts £ 2,000 off the @entity18 bill for thousands of businesses and charities			1
@entity21 will be told to do more to help 16 and 17 - year - olds who will lose their benefits if they refuse to accept training , work placement or community work the new changes for under 21s mean the cost of employing a young person at a salary of £ 12,000 will be reduced by £ 500 , the chancellor said			1
on a salary of £ 16,000 , the bill will be cut for employers by £ 1,000			0
during his @entity37 speech , mr @entity7 said : ‘ we are going to abolish the jobs tax on young people under the age of 21			1
employer national insurance contributions will be removed altogether on a million - and - a - half jobs for young people			1
‘ we ’re not going to leave young people behind as the economy grows			0
we are going to have a responsible recovery for all			0
the cost for a business of employing a young person on a salary of £ 12,000 will fall by over £ 500			0
for someone on £ 16,000 , that ’s over £ 1,000 off			0
’ because the change requires legislation , it will not happen until april 2015 , and will not apply beyond the upper earnings limit of £ 42,285 , he said			0
latest figures show how the proportion of under - 25s described as ' @entity61 ' still stands at almost 15 per cent , despite overall unemployment falling curbs : chancellor @entity7 said young people will not be able to leave school and sign on to the dole mr @entity7 told @entity66 that unemployment was forecast to fall in the next few years from 7.6 to 5.6 per @entity68 have created three jobs for every one lost in the public sector , and this trend was forecast to continue , he said			1
@entity72 , employment tax partner at accountancy firm @entity74 , welcomed the @entity18 changes			0
‘ scrapping @entity18 for the under 21s could save employers up to £ 4,658 per employee so is a valuable incentive to employ younger workers , ’ he said			0
‘ this is a bold move as it will benefit not just small businesses but also multi-nationals			0
’ on the up : almost 30million people are now in work in the @entity87 , up by 1million since the 2010 general election @entity89 , director of @entity89 campaign which called for the move on @entity18 , said : ‘ we are thrilled with this pro-youth @entity37			2
‘ levelling the playing field for under - 21s and backing youngsters to succeed means the government are clearly serious about tackling youth unemployment			2
’ @entity98 , from over- @entity97 , said the announcement was ‘ great news ’			0
‘ we have been campaigning for a cut in taxes on employing young people and the long - term unemployed for many years and we are delighted the government have listened and acted , ’ he said			2
but @entity105 , founder of @entity106 , told the @entity108 website : ‘ i hope we do n’t see a spike in unemployment for 22 - year - olds			1
’ and @entity112 , from @entity113 , said : ‘ removing national insurance contributions for employees under the age of 21 will likely lead to a surge in employment tribunal claims under the age discrimination banner			0
’ mr @entity7 also launched a crackdown on unscrupulous firms who designate their workers as self - employed , depriving them of basic employment rights such as the minimum wage in a bid to avoid employer @entity18			1
poorly qualified youngsters will be banned from going straight from school to a life on the dole , @entity7 said yesterday			1
the chancellor said young jobseekers lacking basic skills will have their benefits docked unless they agree to do up to 16 hours training a week to improve their employment chances			1
the move is designed to tackle growing fears that the one million young people not in employment , education or training – so - called @entity143 – could become a ‘ lost generation ’			1
poorly qualified youngsters will be banned from going straight from school to a life on the dole , @entity7 said it also goes part way towards meeting @entity152 ’s party conference pledge in october that youngsters would be required to ‘ earn or learn ’			1
but it stops short of his plan to strip benefits from the under - 25s , which was vetoed by @entity158			2
under the new scheme , youngsters lacking at least a @entity160 in both maths and @entity162 will be required to undergo extra training in return for their benefit			2
those who are still out of work after six months will be required to sign up for a traineeship , community work or work experience or be stripped of their benefits			1
the scheme will apply to 18 to 21 - year - olds and will be piloted in small areas from next april before being rolled out to the rest of the country			1
mr @entity7 said : ‘ without basic maths or @entity162 , there is a limited chance any young person will be able to stay off welfare			1
so we are taking a new approach			0
’ he went on : ‘ a culture of worklessness becomes entrenched when young people can leave school and go straight onto the dole , with nothing expected in return			2
that option is coming to an end in our welfare system			2
’ mr @entity7 said the government would also invest around £ 10million a year in @entity196 support for 16 and 17 - year - olds who want help to find apprenticeships and training			1
@entity200 , of the @entity201 , welcomed the recognition of the ‘ need to ensure young people have the basic skills required for work ’			2
a new cap on total welfare spending will be set next year and take effect in 2015			2
the chancellor set out plans for a radical new limit , to be set every five years , that will include housing benefit , tax credits , disability benefits and pensioner benefits , although the state pension will be excluded			0
governments will have to comply with any breach of the cap by cutting welfare in what @entity7 says will be a ‘ limit on the nation ’s credit card ’			1
ministers say the cap is designed to prevent repeats of the spike in incapacity benefit claims under the @entity232 governments of the 1980s and 1990s and the surge in housing benefit under @entity234			0
it is also designed to try to bind @entity234 ’s hands by building structural limits into welfare – a huge proportion of government spending			0
governments will have to comply with any breach of the cap by cutting welfare in what @entity7 says will be a ' limit on the nation 's credit card ' @entity234 has indicated that it is prepared to consider backing the idea of a cap , though shadow chancellor @entity251 has controversially suggested pensions might be included too			1
mr @entity7 told mps that benefits which fluctuate with the economy , such as jobseeker ’s allowance , would be excluded from the cap , as well as the state pension			1
but he insisted : ‘ all other benefits , from tax credits to income support , to the vast majority of housing benefit , will be included in the cap			0
’ the @entity265 argue that including state pensions in the cap would not be fair , since it could mean cutting pensions for those who have worked all their lives because costs on housing benefit were getting out of control			0
mr @entity7 said the limit on total welfare expenditure would be set by the chancellor at the beginning of each @entity277 , and mps would be asked to support it			1
if the limit was breached , the chancellor would have to explain why , and a vote would be held in @entity277			0
in 2014 , the government is expected to spend £ 112bn on welfare payments , excluding state pensions			0
@entity285 , of the @entity286 , warned : ‘ many charities fear the new welfare cap will drive the government to make spending decisions that will lead to vulnerable people bearing the brunt of further cuts			0
’ @entity294 , a @entity297 trade and industry spokesman , added : ‘ the devil will be in the detail			0

school leavers will have to accept training or work experience
@entity7 says leaving school and signing on is not an option
@entity21 told to do more to help 16 and 17 - year - olds find work
