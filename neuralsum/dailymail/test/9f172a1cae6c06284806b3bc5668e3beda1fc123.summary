bingo hall toilets have tested positive for traces of @entity3 drugs amid evidence that an increasing number of pensioners are turning to hard drugs in retirement			1
out of 17 bingo halls tested seven showed traces of cocaine , while another had traces of crack cocaine , a more dangerous form of the drug that is smoked , a newspaper investigation revealed			1
while the venues do let players as young as 18 in , the majority of attendees are elderly , and the discoveries mirror a spike in @entity24 being treated for drug abuse			1
out of 17 bingo halls tested across the country , seven had traces of cocaine in the toilets , while this one , in @entity31 , @entity32 , was found to have traces of crack cocaine class a : while bingo halls allow people as young as 18 to visit , the majority of visitors are pensioners ( pictured , @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity32 , where traces of cocaine were found in the toilets ) figures from @entity43 show that 634 pensioners over 65 were treated for substance abuse in the last year , a rise of 20 per cent in a year , and double the rates seen in 2009			1
a probe by @entity49 used swabs coated with special chemicals which reveal traces of cocaine to test toilet cubicles in bingo halls around the country			2
the news comes as hospital figures reveal a spike in drug abuse among the elderly , with 634 treated for addiction last year ( stock picture ) two @entity39 premises in @entity63 and @entity64 , @entity65 , tested positive for the drug , while @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69 , also showed traces of cocaine			1
@entity39 in @entity70 and @entity67 in @entity71 , @entity72 , also had positive results , as did @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity32			2
another @entity32 venue , @entity39 in @entity31 , tested positive for crack cocaine , which is highly addictive			1
@entity76 , of drug charity @entity77 , told the paper â€™s @entity78 that the findings were unsurprising , adding that many older people turn to drugs to combat loneliness , or to socialise			0
she said : ' we assume older people do n't want to go out and socialise , but they do , particularly if they are lonely			0
loneliness is a massive trigger for drugs			0
' the older generation is n't so well informed because we have concentrated on warning young people about drugs			0
representatives from both @entity67 and @entity39 said that their companies took a zero - tolerance policy on drugs and banned taking them on their premises			0
figures released early last year showed that , as well as record numbers of pensioners being hospitalised with drug problems , thousands more were seeking help to kick the habit			0
busted : @entity100 was among the eight premises where traces of @entity3 drugs were found zero tolerance : both @entity39 and @entity67 said drug taking was banned in both of their venues ( pictured , @entity39 in @entity70 , where cocaine traces were discovered ) more than 2,000 people in their 60s , 70s and 80s sought help for problems relating to substance abuse in 2013 - double the number that were receiving treatment only five years ago			2
the dramatic rise is being blamed on those who first experimented with drugs during the 1960s , and have continued to use them on and off over the subsequent decades			0
the majority of those requesting help last year suffered from addictions to heroin or crack cocaine , although there were significant numbers who had problems with cannabis , amphetamines and prescription medications .			2

out of 17 bingo halls tested , seven revealed traces of cocaine in toilets
one , in @entity32 , even tested positive for dangerous variant crack cocaine
