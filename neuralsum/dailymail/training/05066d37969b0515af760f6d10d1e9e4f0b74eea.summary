' @entity0 has denied the allegation			1

ms @entity50 added her voice to calls that @entity0 be jailed after his conviction yesterday for indecently assaulting a young researcher in her early 20s on the @entity60 show in 1995			1
he was cleared of another charge and the jury could not make their mind up on a third , which was recorded as not guilty since it was the second time the facts had proved inconclusive			0
ms @entity50 said she never went to police over her alleged encounter with @entity0			1
she said she and some friends had caught up with the veteran @entity69 in a pub after he had performed in a pantomime in @entity72 , south east @entity2			2
' he kept watching me the whole time , ' she told @entity76 ' then he came up and asked me to help him with some bags			0
' she says she agreed and walked out with him to his car			0
' then he said , " can i have a hug ? " i kind of agreed			0
but he did n't hug me , he groped me			2
he grabbed me and pushed me against the car and kissed me and grabbed my breasts , ' said ms @entity50			0
she told how she pushed @entity0 away and fended off his advances a second time			1
nevertheless , she said , he tried to coax her into his car to go ' for a drive '			0
that victim has told how @entity0 groped her for a ‘ weird sexual thrill ’ when she was a young researcher on the @entity60			1
she fled to her boss , @entity98 producer @entity97 , and told him : ‘ @entity99 , @entity0 just grabbed my t * * s. ’ but the allegation was not pursued by the corporation			1
the woman has since become a successful entertainer in her own right , and admitted in court that she has spoken publicly about @entity0 ’s wandering hands			1
she said she had added humour to make it ‘ palatable for the audience ’ , and defended her choice , saying it was a ‘ positive and healthy ’ way for her to cope with the assault			0
shamed : @entity0 is now facing fresh allegations that he molested a primary school age girl , and today another woman came forward to claim she had been groped by the former @entity69 when she was just 18 years old despite speaking publicly about the assault in the past , the woman has not waived her legal right to anonymity as a victim of sexual assault			1
last night her agent said she did not wish to say anything			0
no official complaint was ever lodged at the corporation , which has come under fire for turning a blind eye to @entity130 ’s abuse of girls and boys on its premises			0
at the time of the assault , in january 1995 , the victim was in her early 20s			2
@entity0 cornered her in a corridor and chastised her for smoking			2
he told her : ‘ you should n’t be smoking – think about what it is doing to your poor little lungs			0
’ @entity0 then touched her ribcage before sliding his hands up to her breasts in a ‘ squeezing grope ’			2
she said the assault ‘ felt like ages ’ but lasted about ten to 15 seconds before she escaped his clutches			0
‘ it was the weirdest thing that had happened to me , ’ said the woman , who gave evidence without a screen , in view of @entity0 in the dock			1
‘ one minute i am meeting this radio dj and the next minute i am being sexually assaulted by him			2
’ @entity0 on the @entity60 show in 1995 : it was behind the scenes of this appearance that @entity0 was found by a jury to have groped the breasts of young researcher , who is now a broadcaster herself in his police interview , @entity0 accused the woman of ‘ jumping on the bandwagon ’ in a bid to boost her career			1
‘ it ’s just good pr for her to have comments saying , “ you know what ? @entity36 groped her ” , ’ he told detectives			0
‘ i remember the days when people touched other people and you kick them in the b * * * s and say “ do n’t be silly ”			0
you do n’t take them to bloody court			0
’ the victim came forward during @entity0 ’s first trial , but was too late to be added to the charges			1
@entity0 has always insisted he is an ' easy target ' since the beginning of investigations into historic abuse by celebrities			2
conceding in evidence that he was ' not an angel ' , he nevertheless denounced his accusers as fantasists who came forward to make money from the media .			0

alleged victim 's case was not pursued by public prosecutors
but she is now preparing to take civil action against the veteran dj
