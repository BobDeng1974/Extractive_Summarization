by @entity0 it began with a little red book and a desire to ensure workers received fair reward for their labours			0
today , the business is the darling of conservative middle @entity9 and one of the few to survive the recession with its reputation enhanced			1
@entity14 is celebrating its 150th anniversary and a unique business model that has worked well both for its customers and the employees , or ‘ partners ’ , who own it			1
@entity14 ( left ) handed over control of the business to his son @entity25 in 1914 , who developed the firm 's catchphrase ' @entity14 ' in fact the company of today is a reflection of the ideals of @entity33 , rather than his father @entity34 who founded the chain as a drapers shop in @entity38 ’s @entity37 in 1864			1
@entity25 was not some kind of chairman @entity40 of the high street , but a gardener and naturalist troubled by the fact his family ’s income was greater than the combined annual earnings of the entire workforce			0
it was @entity25 who gave up his ownership rights to the family business when his father died in the 1920s			1
in what was a revolutionary approach , he handed it to the staff who would run it according to the rules he set out in what became known in the company as the ‘ little red book ’ which he saw as an alternative to @entity65			2
this book contained the constitution for the @entity14 , establishing the ownership rules and setting out a creed of courtesy and integrity that today ’s managers are expected to carry on			1
the little red book , which has been updated many times over the decades , offered a guide to staff on everything from the clothes they should wear to lift etiquette			0
partners were reminded that ‘ they shall never enter or leave a lift or doorway in front of a customer ’			2
high pressure selling was absolutely forbidden , and there was a strict policy confirming that the customer is always right , threatening staff with disciplinary action if they reacted to those who were rude or unreasonable			0
a photograph of the first @entity14 store ( left ) which opened on @entity37 in 1864 it was also @entity25 who developed the ‘ @entity14 ’ policy in 1925 which evolved into the price promise to match the lowest figure of rivals			1
in film footage from the early 1960s @entity25 , then in his seventies , talks about how he had ‘ an idea for a better way of managing business , so that instead of the many being exploited by the few there would be genuine partnership for all , managers and managed alike , all pulling together for their common advantage ’			2
@entity114 , the favoured supermarket of the middle classes was acquired by the @entity14 partnership in 1937 @entity119 archivist @entity118 said : ‘ when he joined the business , the family were taking out £ 26,000 a year			1
the total wage bill for the 300 staff was about £ 16,000 and he thought that was grossly unfair			0
‘ at that time , there was lots of new thinking , we had the rise of the @entity130 , @entity65 and the emancipation of women			0
he was really rebelling against the authoritarian views of his father			2
’ the template continues today with the 91,000 staff in its stores and @entity114 supermarkets sharing in the success of the £ 4billion - a - year business in the form of bonuses			0
the company is marking its 150th anniversary with an exhibition at its @entity147 , where a roof garden will open for the summer .			0

@entity14 was founded in 1864 opening its first store on @entity38 's @entity37
