@entity0 say they have rebuffed an approach from @entity2 for promising defender @entity3			2
the 19 - year - old @entity4 has impressed observers in @entity6 despite struggling to break the partnership of @entity8 and @entity9			2
reports say that @entity2 have offered £ 17.5million for @entity3 , who was bought for just £ 750,000 from @entity11 in april 2013 , and that the offer was rejected			1
the team 's success on the pitch , plus the sales of @entity29 and @entity30 , helped appease the banks last summer but debts still have to be addressed			0
that is creeping around boardrooms in @entity35 hence interest from @entity37 and others in @entity39 as they sense deals can be done			0
the 19 - year - old @entity3 ( left ) has impressed in his fleeting outings for the @entity44 champions this season @entity45 is key to @entity0 's success and the harmony of their squad but he is likely to leave at the end of the season with @entity2 , @entity52 and others all linked should they choose to change their current managers			1
midfielder @entity56 , a long - term target for @entity59 , is tipped to follow his coach , as is @entity9 , but @entity3 is seen as one of the lesser known gems of @entity0 's squad and one @entity2 would do well to sign if @entity65 's injury concerns continue .			0

@entity3 has impressed when called upon at @entity0
19 - year - old joined the club for £ 750,000 from @entity11 in april 2013
@entity0 are currently struggling with a £ *400million* debt
