@entity0 has thrown his support behind former team - mate @entity2 as the right man to ' change the brand of cricket currently being played ' in @entity6			1
ten years on from his career - defining captaincy in the 2005 ashes , @entity2 is the hot favourite to be appointed as director of @entity6 cricket , a streamlined version of the managing director 's job which was abolished with @entity16 's sacking on wednesday			1
the 40 - year - old has previously kept his distance from a formal role with the @entity20 , preferring to focus on his burgeoning media profile and business interests , but has declared himself open to discussions about the new post			1
former @entity6 batsman @entity0 believes @entity2 is the right man to lead @entity6 @entity0 received the lion 's share of attention during a photocall for his new club @entity28 the controversial star and @entity2 were @entity6 team - mates before @entity0 was axed by the @entity20 @entity2 would be a pioneering presence , having spoken with passion and candour about the need to accept @entity6 's failings and press for change at all costs			1
that may yet prove good news for the exiled @entity0			0
the controversial batsman has largely kept his counsel on the demise of @entity16 , whose first act in the job was to sack @entity0 last february			2
but he did tell @entity46 that his 2005 @entity8 captain @entity2 had the credentials to replace him			1
' he ( @entity2 ) is close enough to the game to make changes which need to happen for the good of @entity52 cricket , ' @entity0 said			2
' the way he captained shows he 'll change the brand of cricket currently being played , which we need			0
' @entity2 has previously concentrated on his media duties but is believed to be open to the role the former @entity6 captain speaks with @entity60 during last summer 's @entity62 series with @entity63 @entity2 holds the urn after @entity6 famously reclaimed the ashes against @entity66 in 2005 @entity0 may not have played international cricket for well over a year but his shadow looms large over the current turmoil surrounding @entity6			1
@entity16 's troubled reign was defined by the decision to martyr @entity0 after the 2013/14 @entity8			2
the @entity20 board met at @entity73 on thursday , but there was no official word on the recruitment process			0
instead a short statement merely confirmed that @entity79 's move from chairman to president had been rubber - stamped , with @entity83 deputy chairman @entity82 nominated as vice-chairman			0
@entity79 will become the first @entity20 president on may 14 , a role that carries responsibility for @entity89 business , while his old post will go to @entity91			0
@entity91 was the man who gave new legs to @entity0 's mooted comeback when he appeared to suggest a blank slate policy would take root when he arrived at @entity73			0
@entity91 hinted that a prolific run in county cricket could see him reinstated , which led to the 34 - year - old extricating himself from his @entity99 contract and re-signing with @entity28			2
@entity16 's exit removed one significant obstacle and should @entity2 be handed the new position , that would strengthen his hand yet further			0

there was no news from the board meeting on the future of national selector @entity126 , who appeared vulnerable after @entity16 's dismissal			0
he looks set to continue in the role for the time being and is due to join the senior side in the @entity132 for the second test in @entity134 and third in @entity136 .			0
