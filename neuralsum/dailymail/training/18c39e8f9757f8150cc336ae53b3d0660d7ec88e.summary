@entity2 's @entity1 hoodoo continued as 10 - man @entity3 dented their promotion hopes through @entity7 's spectacular strike			1
but @entity10 's @entity9 leaders had only themselves to blame after substitute @entity11 wasted an opportunity for a 86th - minute equaliser after blasting his penalty against the crossbar			1
' the penalty summed up our night in front of goal and it was not like us , ' said @entity2 manager @entity10			2
@entity3 's @entity7 celebrates after putting the @entity21 1 - 0 up against league leaders @entity2 @entity7 ( left ) lifts his arm in the air at @entity1 as his team - mates join him in celebration during the first half it has been a difficult week for @entity29 ( left ) , but he was happy after @entity7 's first - half strike @entity3 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity31 7 ; @entity32 7 , @entity33 7 , @entity34 8 , @entity35 8 ; @entity36 7 , @entity7 8 , @entity37 7 , @entity38 7 ( @entity39 87 ) ; @entity40 ( @entity41 90 ) ; @entity42 7 ( @entity43 72 ) subs not used : @entity35 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 goal : @entity49 booked : @entity37 15 , @entity36 84 sent off : @entity33 86 @entity2 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity50 6 ; @entity51 6 , @entity37 7 , @entity52 7 , @entity53 7 ; @entity54 6 ( @entity55 72 ) , @entity56 6 ( @entity57 60 , 6 ) , @entity58 7 , @entity59 8 ; @entity60 7 ( @entity61 60 , 6 ) ; @entity62 7 subs not used : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 booked : @entity51 referee : @entity69 7 attendance : 17,634 @entity2 were awarded the spot - kick after referee @entity72 dismissed @entity33 for hauling down @entity62 as he raced into the penalty area			1
moments earlier @entity59 had also struck the woodwork as the visitors made it seven defeats in as many visits to this ground			0
during an even opening period , @entity3 midfielder @entity7 thrashed in from 20 yards and @entity2 , who began the night top of the @entity9 with a three - point buffer to those outside the automatic promotion places , could not muster an equaliser			1
@entity2 had not previously lost on their travels since september at @entity87 , a sequence of eight wins and a draw preceding a trip to one of their least favourite grounds			2
despite carving out some glorious chances against their relegation - threatened hosts , however , they failed to continue that rich run of form			0
@entity62 's pace offered a constant threat on the break – three times he got beyond the home backline but failed to apply a finishing touch – while his strike partner @entity60 had the ball in the net shortly after @entity3 went ahead only for an offside flag to cancel his opportunistic effort out			2
' i had a gut feeling at the time that it was a tough call for us			0
there seemed to be a defender between @entity60 and the goal and if that was the case i will be bitterly disappointed , ' @entity10 added			0
equally contentious was the late penalty and @entity3 manager @entity118 – whose relegation - threatened team held on for a surprise league double – said : ' it seems to be a standing order for us – a bad refereeing decision			1
it 's about three yards outside the box			0
' @entity3 goalkeeper @entity31 ( right ) saves the headed effort of @entity2 's @entity62 @entity3 's @entity36 ( second right ) tries to take the ball past @entity2 's @entity37 at @entity1 @entity2 's @entity37 ( left ) tackles namesake @entity129 during the @entity9 clash on tuesday night in front of their lowest home championship crowd of the season , @entity118 's team went ahead in the 36th minute when @entity36 and @entity135 combined on the right flank to feed @entity7 , who followed his late equaliser against @entity138 at the weekend , by arrowing a left - footed drive beyond the despairing grasp of @entity50 and into the top corner			1
@entity3 , winless in eight matches and reeling from the news that owner @entity29 must resign from the board on wednesday and not have any influence on club affairs until april 10 after he lost his @entity149 appeal , shrugged off their troubles and rode their luck to complete a surprise double over the division 's top team			1
' i spoke to @entity29 yesterday and he basically said that nothing changes			0
it 's still his football club			0
someone else will sign the cheques but it 's business as usual , ' @entity118 said			0
@entity118 had overseen a surprise victory on the south coast during a caretaker spell in charge earlier this season			0
the @entity2 players share a laugh after a piece of advertising board broke from the away dugout @entity3 boss @entity118 gestures to the fourth official from the home dugout at @entity1 banned @entity3 owner @entity29 watches the game against @entity2 from a private box a view from outside the ground shows the words ' @entity3 ' illuminated ahead of the match @entity62 was guilty of profligacy twice more at the start of the second period after his speed off the mark took him past the @entity3 defenders – an indecisive prod across the face of goal followed by an inaccurate shot			1
but if there were any doubts it was to be a rare night of cheer for @entity3 they were dispelled with the late drama .			2

@entity2 went into the game top of the championship , without a loss away from home since september 2014
@entity7 put @entity3 1 - 0 up with a *stunning* first - half strike
@entity3 have had a rough week with the news that owner @entity29 must have no dealings with the club until april
@entity33 was shown a red card after committing a foul in the penalty area late on , but @entity11 missed the spot kick
@entity10 's side could not find an equaliser and @entity3 held on for a win
