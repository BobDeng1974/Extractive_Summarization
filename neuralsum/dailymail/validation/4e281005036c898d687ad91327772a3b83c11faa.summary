the ' disgraceful ' reaction from @entity2 players forced referee @entity3 to send off @entity5 striker @entity4 during the ill - tempered @entity7 tie at @entity8 , said @entity10 's @entity9			1
@entity9 's fellow @entity12 pundit @entity11 went further , branding @entity14 's players ' pathetic ' , but co-commentator @entity15 defended the @entity16 for being ' shrewd '			1
@entity4 was sent off after a lunging challenge on @entity2 's @entity18 on the half hour mark but it appeared harsh as both players made forceful tackles			1
@entity2 players surround referee @entity3 as @entity5 striker @entity4 is shown a red card for fouling @entity18 the @entity2 players swarm around the referee with team - mate @entity18 lying injured on the floor @entity4 is clearly dejected having been sent off after a collision with @entity18 in the first - half @entity12 pundit @entity9 labelled @entity2 players a ' disgrace ' for their reaction to @entity4 the 33 - year - old seemed apologetic as soon as he realised the impact of his challenge before the @entity2 players swarmed the referee demanding action			1
' it was very unfortunate , it ’s not a red card			2
i actually think he ’s trying to pull his foot away			0
you look at it and you think @entity18 ’s foot is as high , if not higher , ' @entity9 said on @entity12			1
‘ if the referee is the other side then the referee might look at @entity18 and give the decision the other way			2
' @entity9 insisted the actions from the @entity2 players were the deciding factor in the dismissal			1
@entity9 ( left ) and @entity11 ( second right ) slammed the behaviour of the @entity2 players the 33 - year - old heads into this challenge with @entity18 ( left ) in the first - half which got him sent off ' the reaction from the @entity2 players is disgraceful			1
it ’s something that is sad that is coming into the game			0
it comes from i think @entity14 ’s teams , they have this reaction , it ’s not a one off , ' added @entity9			1
@entity11 branded the actions of @entity2 's squad ' pathetic '			1
he said : ' in @entity9 ’s ( @entity9 ) generation , when someone caught you , the last thing you wanted to show your opponent is that you ’re injured , today it ’s the exact opposite			2
if someone brushes you , you want to go down and get them in trouble			0
that ’s how pathetic it is			0
' thank goodness @entity5 stood up to that and leave here with great credit			2
they are the proper team			0
' former @entity84 captain @entity15 disagreed with his colleagues			1
he said : ‘ listening to the lads at half - time , i ’m not as damning about @entity2 reacting because partly times it happened during my career when you tried to influence the referee			2
but for far too many times you ’ve seen naive @entity92 teams in @entity93 , that have been done on occasions like that			0
the @entity5 forward immediately acknowledged his fault in the incident having collided with @entity18 ‘ here , we ’ve got a team that is shrewd			2
people at home might not like it but if the boot was on the other foot we ’d be calling @entity5 shrewd			0
they play the game , that ’s what you need to do in @entity109 competition over the last 20 , 30 years			0
it ’s different trying to gain those advantages			0
‘ i like the idea that it ’s an @entity92 team that is shrewd and not the opposition			0
it comes from @entity14 , he knows how to play the game			0
’ however , @entity15 did acknowledge it was a harsh decision on @entity4 : ' it 's not a red card for me , i think that 's a poor decision from the referee			1
he must have got his red card out within two or three seconds			2
' @entity2 captain @entity122 ( left ) reacts after @entity4 's tackle on @entity18 in the first - half at @entity8 at half - time , @entity9 had also suggested that such intimidation comes from their manager @entity14 : ' i always think with @entity14 ’s teams that they will always be respected but they ’ll never be loved because of situations like this			1
' they take winning to another level that no other team or manager does that i ’ve seen over the years			0
' @entity2 boss @entity14 gestures his dissatisfaction as his side crashed out of the @entity7 ' we all want to win but the reaction of the @entity2 players has definitely played a part and @entity14 ’s words in the press conference have worked			1
' @entity14 , in his post-match interview after his side were beaten on away goals , bemoaned @entity5 ’s apparent time wasting but @entity9 dismissed such claims as hypocrisy			1
‘ @entity14 is the master of time wasting and he did that from the first two minutes at @entity149 last year ( when @entity2 all but ended @entity151 ’s title hopes ) , ' he said			2
' i ’m not criticising him , i applauded him at the time and i know it ’s part of the game , but he ca n’t complain about @entity5 and that @entity92 football is clean as the only dirty tricks we saw were from @entity2 by surrounding the referee and the reaction was disgraceful			1
’ the striker is consoled by @entity5 boss @entity162 as he trudges off the pitch at @entity8 @entity9 also questioned the quality of the @entity165 after @entity2 crashed out : ' as a football person you want to see the best teams go through , we want the @entity92 teams to do well , to go through and represent our country , ' he said at full - time			1
' you think of the tv deal , the money we ’ve got , we ’re getting kidded			0
you see some of the players @entity5 have got			2
now they ’ve paid big money as well but you look at @entity179 , @entity180			0
we ’re supposed to be the biggest league in the world , with the best players			0
' former @entity2 defender @entity184 jumps into the air in celebration having fired @entity5 back into the tie @entity12 pundit @entity11 branded the @entity2 players ' pathetic ' for their antics on wednesday in the @entity12 studio at full - time @entity11 was keen to highlight @entity2 's behaviour was ' unacceptable ' and was full of praise for the @entity194 : ' it hurts me to say this but @entity2 earlier with their shenanigans early on , with the manager coming out with his talk that this is the most aggressive team we ’ve ever played			1
saying they are over physical , @entity14 is having a laugh , ' @entity11 told @entity12			1
' this is a team that is full of technique , a really good footballing team			0
they had to put up with a lot of stuff i find really unappealing			0
the @entity2 players are stunned as they were knocked out of the @entity7 on wednesday ' that is from other players , the minute they come out of the tunnel , the first minute of the game , they are looking to get the opposition in trouble , get them booked , see if they can get them sent off			1
the reaction from the @entity2 players on the challenge on @entity18 opitimises what i ’m saying , ' added @entity11			1
' to a man they were surrounding the referee , even @entity223 ran 50 yards to get involved			0
@entity18 originally was n’t going to get involved and then you can see in the pictures that as soon as his team - mates all raising their arms around the referee , then he gets involved			2
' that ’s something we can deal without , it ’s not the @entity236 way of doing things and it is creeping into our game which i find it totally unacceptable			0
' @entity184 and the @entity5 squad celebrate moving into the quarter - finals in front of their adouring fans			0
