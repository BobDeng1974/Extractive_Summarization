trains using the line between @entity17 and @entity18 , on the @entity19 , are too old to have sewage tanks so when passengers use the toilet the result is dumped onto the tracks and sprays into her garden			1
@entity9 said she ca n't let her great - grandchildren play outside her home in @entity13 , north @entity14 mrs @entity9 said : ' i had a new bedding set and i put it on the line and the baby clothes - when i came out it was covered everywhere			1
' luckily , i had moved the wendy house and swings that i have at the bottom of my garden to mow the lawn - if they were there they would have been covered			2
' i had to go out with a scarf around my face and plastic bags around my feet and bin the whole lot			0
' mrs @entity9 said waste had sprayed into her back garden several times , but the incident which led her to bleach her garden was the most shocking			1
she said : ' it covered my sheets and pillow cases and i had to shut all of the windows			0
i did n't know where it had come from - i thought it was coming from planes flying overhead			2
i could n't believe the mess , it was atrocious			0
' mrs @entity9 said her back garden is about 10 feet from the line			1
' i 'm surprised it is getting dumped there because i am so close to @entity13 station , ' she said			2

' train operator @entity14 admit their ageing rolling stock does n't have toilet retention tanks , so the waste is simply dumped			1

trains run less then 10 feet from @entity9 's garden ' at times the train gets up quite a speed and if it is on an embankment it is going to run down the hill and anyone with property or play areas in the vicinity of the railway embankment could be sprayed			1
' train companies must stop doing it			0
' a spokesman for @entity14 , which runs services on the line , confirmed toilet waste was being released on the track			0

' @entity117 , which is responsible for the railway infrastructure , carries out track cleaning and a contract is in place to clean the track bed of deposits			0
' we ask passengers to refrain from using toilets when trains are stationary in any station platform on our network			2
' all rolling stock built prior to 1997 will be withdrawn from operation by 2020			0
' those built since 1997 will be fitted with toilet retention tanks and the practice of deposits onto the tracks from trains will be eliminated			2
' we are sorry if local residents living very close to the tracks have encountered issues with train waste and would encourage them to speak to our customer relations department			2
