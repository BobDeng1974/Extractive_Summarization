by @entity0 published : 23:07 est , 17 february 2014 @entity2 : 12:57 est , 18 february 2014 watch your back , @entity5 ! @entity7 @entity6 referee @entity5 is now despised in @entity8 for ruling a goal in @entity11 's favor during saturday 's game against the home team angry @entity8 today gathered at the @entity14 in @entity15 to make apparent death threats against the @entity7 hockey referee who they blame for their country â€™s thrilling hockey loss to the states at the weekend			1
although the fans insist the threats to boil @entity25 and render his flesh into soap are light - hearted , it reflects growing anger in the country at the decision to have an @entity7 referee adjudicate the crucial match			0
@entity8 coach @entity35 believes the game would have ended differently if @entity5 had n't disallowed a @entity8 goal late in the game that would have put them in the lead			1
' the referee made a mistake of course , it would have been more effective to have a different judge , ' @entity35 said			1
the score was 2 - 2 when a @entity8 player @entity47 hit the puck into the goal , but the score came into contention when @entity7 goaltender @entity52 pointed out that the net was off its base			2
after reviewing footage , @entity5 and @entity57 referee @entity55 agreed that the net was off its base before the score and the goal could n't be counted			2
the crowd of more than 11,000 at @entity62 , populated with home country fans including president @entity64 , erupted in anger at the call			1
' it was definitely a goal , ' @entity8 player @entity67 said			2
' the goalie touched the net so the net moved			0
the referee had to see it			0
[ @entity5 ] should have given [ @entity52 ] two minutes			0
' asked whether more neutral referees should be chosen for the @entity75 , @entity35 said : ' we do n't appoint the referees , a board of referees appoints them , so we can only take the situation as a given			0
' the @entity7 went on to win the match thanks to @entity82 scoring four times in the shootout			0
jumping the gun : @entity8 celebrates a goal in the third period , but the score was eventually disallowed because the net was displaced advance : the @entity7 team went on to win the match against @entity8 3 - 2 and will compete in the quarterfinals in two days still in the running : the @entity8 are still in the tournament but will have to fight it out with @entity96 to stay in medal contention in a match tomorrow the @entity99 later defended @entity5 's decision saying the rulings made by the two referees ' was the correct call and that the proper procedure had been followed with regards to the video review '			1
that has n't stopped @entity8 from voicing their anger online and in public protests in @entity15			1
many @entity8 fans have posted pictures of @entity5 on @entity112 , with comments like ' remember the face of the a * * h * * * ' and ' we will not forget this face '			2
the threats were more direct in @entity15 on monday when @entity8 fans gathered outside the @entity14 to protest @entity5 's call			1
demonstration : @entity8 fans even went so far to protest @entity5 outside the @entity7 embassy in @entity15 after saturday 's game some of the fans participated in a @entity8 sports tradition of shredding soap , which is meant to symbolize killing someone and rendering their fat to make soap			1
the other interpretation is the soap used on a noose in a hanging			0
while that sounds like a death threat , the fans insist it is light - hearted			0
' please do n't take it as a death threat , ' @entity140 , writer for @entity141 , told @entity144			0
the @entity8 have not yet been knocked out of the tournament			0
