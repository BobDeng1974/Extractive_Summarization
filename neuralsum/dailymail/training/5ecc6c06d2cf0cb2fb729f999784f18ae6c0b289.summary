’ last night mr @entity3 insisted his comments were about the need for more working - class mps and ‘ in no way a criticism ’ of mr @entity6 or his office			1
he added in a statement : ‘ for the record , i believe @entity6 is absolutely the right man to bring in policies that will be of great benefit to people in the @entity13 and across the country			1
’ however , his comments come as @entity40 fight over the direction of the party following the critique by mr @entity29 – who last night quickly backtracked over his remarks			2
