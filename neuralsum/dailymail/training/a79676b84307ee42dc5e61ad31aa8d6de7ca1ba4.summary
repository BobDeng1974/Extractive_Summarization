teenage pregnancy rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1960s			1
figures released yesterday showed that conceptions among under - 18s dropped by 10 per cent in 2012			2
but teenage abortion rates have risen sharply in the past decade , the @entity5 revealed			2
the under - 18 conception rate fell in 2012 to 27.9 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 17 under - 18 conception rate by local council reasons for the sudden decrease in pregnancies include more girls staying in further education and the growing ‘ stigma ’ of teenage motherhood , officials said			1
the conception rate for women aged 40 and over has more than doubled since 1990 , while the number of women in this age group conceiving has risen from 12,032 in 1990 to almost 29,000 in 2011 and 2012			1
for women aged 40 and over , the percentage of conceptions leading to abortion fell from 43 per cent in 1990 to 28 per cent in 2010 , 2011 and 2012			1
the @entity5 said : ‘ reasons for an increased number of women conceiving at ages 30 and above include increased participation in higher education , increased female participation in the labour force , the increasing importance of a career , the rising opportunity costs of childbearing , labour market uncertainty , housing factors and instability of partnerships			1
’ independent experts also cited the fall in the popularity of drinking , drugs and smoking and pointed out that many youngsters spend time alone on the internet , instead of mixing with others on the streets			0
the sudden fall in teenage pregnancies came two years after the @entity55 stopped millions being poured into distributing condoms and employing sex advisers for teenagers , through @entity60 ’s £ 250million @entity59 ( @entity61 )			2
the rate has dropped by 25 per cent since 2009 – the last full year of the @entity61			0
professor @entity63 , of @entity64 , said : ‘ these figures demonstrate that it is not the provision of contraception which is having an effect			0
during the years of big spending , there was very little change in teenage pregnancy rates			0
’ the @entity5 report said the figures could be due to ‘ a shift in aspirations of young women towards education and the perception of stigma associated with being a teenage mother ’			1
early motherhood can be ‘ associated with poor educational achievement , poor physical and mental health , social isolation , poverty and related factors ’ , it added			0
there were 27,834 pregnancies among under - 18s in @entity93 and @entity94 in 2012 – down by around 10 per cent from the 31,051 in 2011			0
it is the lowest under - 18 pregnancy rate since 1969			1
in 2012 , there were an estimated 884,748 conceptions in women of all ages , compared with 909,109 in 2011 , a decrease of 2.7 per cent the @entity61 failed to make any serious dent in the figures in the nine years after it was launched by @entity103 in 1999 – and in two of those years conception rates actually went up			1
as well as the provision of condoms and advisers to teach teenagers how to use them , the scheme gave advice on abortions – which have risen sharply over the past decade , according to the @entity5			0
its report said almost half of under - 18 pregnancies end in abortion – compared to two in five in 1992 – and six out of ten pregnant under - 16s have a termination			1
but older women are increasingly unlikely to abort a baby			0
the termination rate across all ages fell from 22.5 per cent in 2002 to 20.8 per cent in 2012			0
after the @entity55 abolished the @entity61 its ex-head , @entity124 , said in 2011 : ‘ i could well predict that over the next year or so the rates will stall or start increasing			0
’ but yesterday ’s figures show that instead teenage pregnancies fell at an unprecedented rate .			2

under - 18 conception rate fell in 2012 to 27.9 *%* per 1,000 15 - 17 - year - olds
lowest figure since records began in 1969 , after years of falling figures
fall linked to rising aspirations and ' stigma ' of being teenage mother
the conception rate among over- 40s has doubled since 1990
@entity5 says women are delaying pregnancy for work and *financial* stability
