by @entity0 published : 05:27 est , 17 april 2012 updated : 07:37 est , 17 april 2012 this sunday marks the 19th year since @entity1 was brutally knifed to death by a group of racist white youths on a patch of pavement in @entity7 , south @entity8			1
it will also be the 13th year that his mother @entity10 , 59 , has spent alone , trying to come to terms the traumatic event which changed the course of her life			2
she had been married for 28 years , but six years after @entity1 's stabbing on april 22 1993 , her relationship with @entity16 broke down and she now describes herself as being in ' a lonely place			1
' isolated : @entity19 has spent more than 13 years alone , trying to come to terms with her son 's death this year on january 3 , the @entity23 gained some form of closure as two of @entity1 's killers , @entity1 , 36 , and @entity1 , 35 , were sentenced for murder - described by mr @entity28 as ‘ a terrible and evil crime ’			1
because both defendants were 17 and 16 at the time of the attack , they were sentenced as juveniles , @entity1 was told he would serve at least 15 years and two months while @entity1 was given a minimum of 14 years			1
had they been sentenced as adults , the judge said they would have received a minimum tariff of 30 years			0
but @entity10 says after 18 years of living in limbo , awaiting some kind of justice , she still remains ' shell - shocked ' , and her health has suffered as a consequence			1
' i have n't been well since the verdict : my body 's been racked with pains , a physical manifestation of grief			0
' i spend a lot of time on my own , living with the memories of what happened			0
it 's a lonely place			0
i would n't wish it on anyone , ' she told @entity59 magazine			0
@entity10 and @entity60 in 1993 , after @entity1 's murder			1
they divorced after the heartbreak of the murder memorial : the black marble plaque which marks the spot where @entity1 died in @entity7 , in 1993 @entity10 has also chronicled the disintegration of their relationship in painful detail in her memoir , and still i rise			1
she described how she left @entity16 for four days on their first @entity72 without @entity1 because his behaviour was so intolerable ; how they argued bitterly over his remoteness on a trip to @entity78 to lay a headstone on @entity1 's grave			1
@entity1 as a teenager with his life ahead of him			2
it was cruelly cut short when he was murdered and she told how he would later drift away from his family for months at a time to stay with relatives on the island , or in @entity88 , leaving her to face the inquest and continue the work of the @entity91 alone			0
the pair divorced in 1999 and @entity16 now lives in @entity78			2
@entity16 previously told @entity94 writer @entity93 : ‘ when @entity1 was murdered , @entity10 and me had been married for more than 20 years			1
things might not always have been perfect between us , but we had a normal , loving relationship			0
‘ but our world began falling apart from the moment the hospital staff told us our son had died			1
for some reason that i ’ve tried to understand - and i still do n’t - we could n’t reach out to one another			0
‘ we stayed together for another six years , but from that day we never physically touched one another again			2
we did n’t cuddle or hold hands for comfort , as you might expect a couple to do			0
‘ we would sleep in the same bed , but we lay side - by - side like statues			0
‘ it took those boys ten seconds to murder @entity1			1
in those ten seconds they wrecked four other lives , too : mine , @entity10 ’s , and @entity116 and @entity117 ’s ( his other children , now 34 and 29 respectively )			2
’ while her marriage fell apart , @entity10 focused her efforts on helping her two other children @entity117 and @entity116 cope with the death of their brother , and fighting for justice			2
@entity10 regards as her proudest achievement the setting up of the @entity126 , which provides bursaries for youngsters from ethnic minorities to pursue their educational ambitions			2
awarded an obe in 2003 in recognition of her work , she says she will continue fighting to give young men like @entity1 all the opportunities he was denied and her reputation for being a tough campaigner has won her places on various boards advising government policy makers and senior police officers on race relations			0
this sunday , @entity10 will visit the exact spot where @entity1 died , now marked with a black marble memorial plaque - something she likes to think of as a grave stone as @entity1 is buried in @entity78 at a remote location in the rural highlands next to his great - grandmother			1
@entity19 has made this pilgrimage every year since 1993 to lay flowers and talk to her son			0
she added : ' i suppose , against such a background , that what happened with @entity16 , @entity1 's dad , was inevitable			1
' something had to give			0
' read the full interview in this week 's @entity59 magazine , out now .			0
