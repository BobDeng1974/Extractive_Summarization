by @entity1 reporter published : 04:02 est , 2 august 2013 @entity3 : 09:47 est , 2 august 2013 car insurance renewal can be stressful at the best of times with the fear of rising cost			1
spare a thought then for @entity9 who was quoted £ 1.2million for his £ 1,400 @entity10			1
the 27 - year - old contacted @entity12 to make sure the figure was correct and they helpfully offered him the opportunity of paying it in instalments of £ 104,000 a month			1
overpriced : @entity9 , 27 , was offered a quote of £ 1.2million to insure his £ 1,400 @entity10 a screengrab shows the massive quote mr @entity9 was given by @entity12 when he tried to insure his car online mr @entity9 , who lives in the @entity22 area of @entity23 , said : ' i went through all the questions and then the quote came up for £ 1,165,977.75			1
i was convinced it must be a mistake , so i called them up on their helpline			0
' they did n’t even seem to be shocked by it			0
they checked it for me and then said it was right			0
' he was even more shocked that they suggested he could pay in instalments if he could not afford the total upfront - with a first payment of £ 233,000 followed by 10 months at £ 104,000 per month			1
he said : ' i ’m convinced they were just trying to price me out of buying insurance with them but it ’s a ridiculous way of doing it			2
i ’d love to know how they would have reacted if i ’d just agreed to it - although with a car worth less than £ 1,500 it was never going to be likely			2
' mr @entity9 , a project analyst for @entity50 , passed his test two years ago and had been paying £ 2,000 to insure a @entity52 before he bought the second - hand corsa			1
he has a clean record with no accidents and no convictions			0
he claimed his quote was just one example of how young and new drivers are treated poorly by insurance firms			1
he added : ' i ’ve got one of the cheapest cars you can get but the criteria for insurance is crazy			2
if i change a search from living alone to co-habiting , it goes down by £ 200			2
' he says postcode - based quotes are also unfair			0
' i ’m classed as @entity71 because of the first three figures - why do n’t they look at the whole postcode ? the way they assess risk makes no sense at all			0
' unfair : despite mr @entity9 's car being one of the cheapest on the market , he was quoted extortionate insurance prices mr @entity9 is now insured with @entity84 , which is owned by @entity86 , and pays around £ , 2000			1
he has a @entity87 - a black box which records how he drives to lower insurance rates			2
he added : ' that ’s not fair either really because when you go over a speed bump it counts against you , and if you have to stop suddenly because someone steps into the road it does too			0
' @entity97 , group underwriting director at @entity99 , which runs @entity12 , said : ' the price mr @entity9 was quoted reflects that we have ‘ declined ’ to provide cover , as we would not expect a customer to pay such a high premium			1
' this is not a case of pricing customers out of the market but quoting on the risks that are within our rating parameters and declining if they are outside			0
' without the detail we are unable to tell why @entity12 was unable to provide cover at the time			0
we are aware this website has changed the way it quotes since mr @entity9 used it , so that if a quote is over £ 10,000 it ‘ declines ’ rather than quotes a high premium			1
' a spokesman from @entity123 said its premium is based on statistics			0
he said quotes change because of factors like marital status or postcode because they reflect the risk taken on by an insurance company .			0

@entity9 said insurance companies treat young drivers ' unfairly '
he had *previously* been paying £ 2,000 a year to insure a @entity52
@entity138 said it would not expect a customer to pay such a high premium
