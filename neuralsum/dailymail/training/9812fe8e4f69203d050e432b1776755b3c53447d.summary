by @entity0 @entity1 has added a crucial step as it bids to launch tourists into space with the announcement of its hotel partner for prospective travellers			1
the company has selected @entity10 for its elite roster of passengers who will pay £ 120,000 per person to make the flights from @entity15			1
@entity1 also announced a contract with @entity17 of @entity10 to provide catering for travelers during their training at @entity15 and said it is relocating more of its staff to @entity22 and will be hiring locally in the next few months			2
impressive : the hotel will certainly put prospective space travellers into a relaxed state of mind chilled : the @entity27 outdoor patio where guests can sample a cocktail or two the company is the anchor tenant in the $ 209 million futuristic @entity15 that the state built for @entity1 founder @entity33 to launch his flights from			1
but the project and @entity1 have been plagued by delays			2
originally , @entity33 had said he hoped to launch the flights by the end of 2010			2
the company is now hoping to begin operations by the end of this year , although its public relations agency said in a statement that the schedule ' will ultimately be dictated by safety and readiness — as has always been the case			0
' in the southern part of @entity22 , the grand @entity49 of the full - service @entity50 , overlooking the beautiful historic @entity52 , creates an ambiance reflective of the area ’s rich @entity55 and @entity56 history and tradition			1
vibrant colors , rich fabrics and textures , and one - of - a - kind pieces from old @entity22 give this hotel a sense of grandeur not found in contemporary brand hotels			0
the hotel features free @entity68 internet , @entity70 casual dining restaurant serving new @entity56 cuisine and world - famous margaritas , @entity74 , an upscale club featuring musical entertainment and specialty cocktails , an updated @entity79 fitness room , and brand new outdoor swimming pool and @entity81 , lush new outdoor gardens , gift shop , and business centre			1
the partnership with the hotel , however , addresses concerns about where celebrities and others who can afford the pricey flights will stay while they go through pre-space flight training			2
early on in spaceport 's development , there was talk of building an ultra-luxury hotel in the area			2
and about four years ago , when @entity33 announced he was creating a @entity1 hotel brand , he told a hotel conference one of the first ones might be built near spaceport			0
but that never came to fruition			0
@entity15 is about 60 miles from @entity103 , near the town of @entity105 , and about 182 miles from @entity106			0
but even the state 's largest city lacks a five - star hotel			0
as part of its partnership with @entity15 , @entity110 will spend several million dollars on upgrades , which will include the creation of ' executive suite vip wings ' with concierge service , private vip areas , customized room service menus , and upgraded rooms and suites			1
the hotel is also working on other upgrades that should boost its aaa rating from three to four diamonds			0
@entity22 has no @entity126 hotels , the top ranking			0
' by partnering with @entity50 and @entity17 , we further our vision of investing in the local @entity22 community while we define the @entity1 astronaut experience , ' said @entity1 ceo @entity132			1
' future astronauts will come from around the world to @entity22 , so it 's important that they experience the outstanding local offerings and character as part of their experience			0
' classy : as long as they are n't too nervous to eat , guests will be able to indulge in some fine dining before their flight rest your head : a good night 's sleep ahead of a momentous adventure might not go to plan ... @entity149 entrance : the hotel lobby is both welcoming as well as reflective mine 's a double : make sure to reserve a table in the relaxing bar area work it : the hotel 's @entity157 facility may relax the mind scenic : @entity33 wanted a luxury hotel to house what are expected to be a number of celebrities in for space travel out there : guests will then be transported th @entity15 from their plush surroundings to prepare for their journey welcoming : @entity33 hopes the @entity169 can provide his guests with the perfect relaxation			1

@entity50 will provide travellers with a whole *lot* of luxury
@entity55 and @entity56 @entity56 history and tradition throughout building
*highlights* include @entity79 fitness room and piano terrace
tourists will pay around £ 120,000 for space flight
