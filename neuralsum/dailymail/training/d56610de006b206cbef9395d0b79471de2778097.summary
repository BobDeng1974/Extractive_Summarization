@entity0 plans to talk to doctors about an occasionally recurring virus type symptoms that helped sink her @entity3 hopes this morning			1
the euphoria of her weekend title win in @entity6 was to be short - lived as her stay in the season 's opening @entity10 event singles proved contrastingly short			2
the @entity11 no 1 , complaining of nausea and blurred vision , was bundled out of the first round by @entity15 6 - 4 , 6 - 0 in 83 minutes on what was a more humid day in the @entity18 capital			1
@entity0 was struggling with nausea as she crashed out to @entity15 @entity0 was not at her best as she was knocked out in the first round @entity0 had to call for both the trainer and doctor during her defeat by @entity15 @entity0 was unable to reproduce the form that saw her win in @entity6 at the weekend @entity0 looks disappointed as she goes out in the first round as @entity15 celebrates afterwards @entity0 explained : ' yesterday i woke up not feeling that great and today i struggled on the court to have energy			1
against any player here it 's tough enough when you 're fit			2
' in 2013 she suffered from glandular fever , although does not feel the sporadic bouts of lethargy are related to that : ' i have one or two days when i feel like this here and there			0
i 'm going to see the doctor but i think it 's just the way my body works			0
' it 's very frustrating , especially as this is one of those times i want all my energy			0
' she still plans to play in the doubles before heading home			0
@entity15 took just over an hour and 20 minutes to beat @entity0 in the first round in @entity52 @entity15 looked good with her groundstrokes as she progressed 6 - 4 , 6 - 0 @entity0 shakes hands with @entity15 after her defeat in the first round of the @entity3 @entity0 started shakily and then called on both the trainer and doctor for treatment when she was trailing 2 - 5 in the first set			1
the treatment and delay briefly seemed to galvanise her as she got back to 4 - 5 , but once @entity15 had closed out the first set the match ran away quickly			1
certainly this was not the usual kind of performance from the 22 year - old @entity66 , who on saturday collected her second @entity68 title in @entity69 which carried her to a career high ranking of 38			0
she particularly struggled with her serve , landing only 46 per cent of her first deliveries in and was unable to take advantage of the brief bouts of inconsistency of her opponent , who was cheered on by a noisy enclave of @entity80 fans around the @entity81 outside court			0
it is easy to see why @entity15 has done especially well at @entity84 ( where she has been a semi and quarter finalist ) as her groundstrokes , struck with her long levers , are especially flat and penetrating			2
@entity0 looked very deflated afterwards , her defeat meaning @entity11 interest in the women 's singles ending by lunchtime on the second day .			1

@entity0 suffered from nausea and blurred vision during her defeat
@entity15 progressed to the second round 6 - 4 , 6 - 0
