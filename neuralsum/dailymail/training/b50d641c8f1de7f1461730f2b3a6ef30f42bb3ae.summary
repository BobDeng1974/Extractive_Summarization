@entity0 hit another obstacle in his already troubled @entity3 title defence when his @entity4 sputtered to a stop early in the opening practice session for sunday 's @entity7			1
@entity8 steered his mercedes to the fastest lap time of 1:27.023 , while team - mate and championship leader @entity10 was limited to only nine laps due to a cooling issue			1
@entity0 , running with a new chassis this weekend in a bid to find a cure for his poor form so far , was forced to pull off the track as his car ground to a halt with an electrical issue after completing only four laps			2
although the team had 50 minutes to work on the problem , they were unable to get @entity0 back out on the circuit , leaving him down in 20th place on the timesheet , with only the @entity54 of @entity55 and @entity56 behind him			0
@entity4 later revealed that the issue would force @entity0 out of friday 's second session			1
' due to an electrical problem that has damaged the wiring loom of @entity61 1 , @entity0 will not be able to take part in @entity63 , ' @entity4 said ' the team will use the time to fix it to be ready for @entity66 tomorrow			1
' as the man to beat following three successive victories for the first time in his @entity3 career , @entity8 was comfortably quickest by almost nine tenths of a second over @entity72 - the surprise name at the top of the timesheets			2
the concern for @entity8 's rivals is there is far more to come from his mercedes as he was fastest in all three sectors , albeit at different stages rather than on one single lap. on track : @entity8 enjoyed another productive practice session ahead of the @entity41 @entity7 all smiles : the @entity87 driver appeared in relaxed spirits as he waved to the crowd during friday 's practice session on the hard tyre , the slower of the two @entity93 compounds being used this weekend , the combined time of the three sectors was 1min 26.6secs , over four tenths of a second faster			1
@entity72 had warned on thursday it was unlikely anyone would be in a position to challenge @entity79 , despite all teams bringing a major upgrade package to this event , and on first inspection his words appeared to carry plenty of truth			2
at least the 34 - year - old 's @entity110 was the best of the rest , with @entity72 second , ahead of @entity4 's @entity115 , the only other driver to finish within a second of @entity8 as the @entity109 was 0.950secs adrift			1
with @entity119 president @entity118 in the paddock , @entity117 hauled his car up to fourth , albeit 1.1secs behind @entity8 , with team - mate @entity123 sixth			0
improvement : @entity72 finished second quickest during friday 's opening practice session in @entity41 concern : @entity10 completed only nine laps sandwiched between them was @entity10 , who had declared his hope on thursday for a less problematic weekend than occurred at the last race in @entity131 where he encountered numerous issues			1
@entity10 , however , only managed nine laps in his mercedes due to a cooling concern with the @entity135 ( energy recovery system )			2
@entity110 's @entity137 and @entity138 in his @entity139 were seventh and eighth quickest , followed by @entity140 in his @entity141			0
@entity140 , though , was forced to kick his heels in the garage for over half an hour as his team fixed an unusual problem - a loose wing mirror			0
the @entity147 had to drive one - handed at one point as he tried to stop the mirror from flapping around inside the cockpit of his car before returning to the pits for repairs			0
@entity157 reserve @entity155 suffered a more serious moment of consternation when his brakes failed at the end of the pit straight on the approach to turn one			0
fans behind the barriers ducked for cover as @entity168 speared through the gravel , narrowly avoiding a crash			0
in recovering the car and returning to the track , the @entity171 was then able to tour back to the garage where he remained for the final 28 minutes .			0

@entity8 was over eight tenths of a second clear of @entity72
championship leader @entity10 completed nine laps after an @entity135 issue
