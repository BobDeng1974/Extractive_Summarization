a vaccine to protect millions from the ebola virus decades after it was first detected does not exist because the disease previously only affected poor @entity5 nations			1
the head of the @entity8 's scathing conclusion came as nearly 5,000 people have lost their lives to the hemorrhagic fever - the majority in @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
dr @entity16 , director general of the @entity8 , criticized drugs companies for turning their backs on ' markets that can not pay '			1
she said the current outbreak - the most deadly in history - has exposed two @entity8 arguments ' that have fallen on deaf ears for decades '			1
the first @entity31 drug trial in @entity32 has started with three healthcare workers in @entity34 , pictured dr @entity16 , director general of the @entity8 , said : ' why are clinicians still empty handed , with no vaccines and no cure ? because @entity31 has historically been confined to poor @entity5 nations ' three @entity34 health workers have been given the experimental vaccine , as 37 more prepare to take part in the trial			1
it is hoped the first results of the trials will be available at the end of next year there are also vaccination trials ongoing in the @entity48 and @entity49 , and @entity50 , who are working on developing the drug , are producing 10,000 doses , which , if the first phase of the trial prove successful , will be available to vaccinate front line healthcare workers in @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 early next year addressing the regional committee for @entity32 in @entity58 yesterday , dr @entity56 said : ' @entity31 emerged nearly four decades ago			1
why are clinicians still empty handed , with no vaccines and no cure ? ' because @entity31 has historically been confined to poor @entity5 nations			1
' the r&d ( research and development ) incentive is virtually non-existent			0
' a profit - driven industry does not invest in products for markets that can not pay			0
' @entity8 has been trying to make this issue visible for ages			0
now people can see it for themselves			0
' she highlighted an ' urgent need to strengthen long - neglected health systems ' , in @entity32			1
' when heads of state in non-affected countries talk about @entity31 , they rightly attribute the outbreak 's unprecedented severity to the " failure to put basic public health infrastructures in place " , ' dr @entity56 said			1
' without fundamental public health infrastructures in place , no country is stable			0
' no resilience exists to withstand the shocks that our 21st century societies are delivering with ever - greater frequency and force , whether from a changing climate or a runaway killer virus			0
' she added : ' the @entity31 outbreak that is ravaging parts of @entity32 is the most severe acute public health emergency seen in modern times			2
' professor @entity99 , one of the team who first discovered the ebola virus in @entity103 , now the @entity104 , in 1976 , has warned the current outbreak is unlikely to be brought under control in the absence of a vaccine			1
nurses prepare to carry the body of an @entity31 victim for burial in a community on the outskirts of @entity115 a @entity117 worker picks up the body of a suspected @entity31 victim , removing it from a township in @entity115 , ready for burial giving a seminar at @entity123 last month , he said : ' in theory @entity31 is very easy to control , but it has got completely out of hand			2
' this is no longer an epidemic , it is a humanitarian crisis			0
it may be we have to wait for a vaccine to stop the epidemic			0
' the good news is i think this is the last @entity31 outbreak where we only have isolation and quarantine to treat			2
' hopefully we will have a drugs and vaccines to offer in @entity32			2
' development of vaccines typically take up to 10 years , but in august who took the unprecedented decision to fast - track clinical trials of those drugs in development			2
the most promising vaccine is @entity50 's @entity142 drug			0
the pharmaceutical giants are working with the @entity144 to develop @entity145 , which is currently the subject of clinical trials in the @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity34 and @entity147			1
initial results from the phase one trials are expected by the end of next year , the company said			1
the @entity49 - led trials are taking place at the @entity154 in @entity155 , supported by a £ 2.8million grant from the @entity157 , the @entity158 and the government			1
funding from the consortium supporting the vaccine is enabling @entity50 to begin manufacturing around 10,000 additional doses of the vaccine in preparation			0
a @entity14 burial team collect the body of a victim at a motor vehicle garage in @entity170 on the outskirts of @entity115 health workers stand in an area used for @entity31 quarantine after caring for two - year - old @entity175 , who died at an ebola virus center in @entity177 , @entity34 - the first death in the country it means if the phase one trials are a success , the next stage of the clinical trial can begin early next year , involving the vaccination of thousands of frontline healthcare workers in @entity13 , @entity15 and @entity14			1
@entity50 said : ' if the vaccine candidate is able to protect these healthcare workers as we hope it will , it could significantly contribute to efforts to bring this epidemic under control			1
' another potential vaccine , @entity197 - @entity31 , is being developed by scientists at @entity200 's @entity199 , supported by a £ 3.1million grant from the @entity157			0
animal studies have suggested the vaccine is ' very effective ' , and clinical trials began in the @entity48 last month			2
professor @entity99 said the current outbreak will not be brought under control until there is a vaccine the first results are expected by december , and there are plans to trial the vaccine in @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216			1
in august the @entity217 announced a donation of the experimental drug to the @entity8			0
the first shipment - which will ultimately total 800 vials of the vaccine - was sent to the @entity8 in @entity223 in october , where partners and the health authorities from the affected nations will determine how the vaccine should be distributed and used			2
since professor @entity99 and his colleagues first uncovered the deadly disease in 1976 there had been 25 outbreaks until the current epidemic			1
in the virus ' 37 - history , there had been around 1,500 deaths , confined to @entity237 , until a two - year - old child in a remote @entity15 village died from @entity31 in december , sparking this crisis			2
equating to around 40 deaths a year , professor @entity99 said @entity31 was not considered a big public health problem			1
as a result there had been little interest from pharmaceutical companies and governments around the world in focusing on developing a vaccine			0
professor @entity99 , said : ' we always thought it would be an accident of nature , and that now and then people would die			2
' most of these outbreaks have been in @entity237			0
there was one in @entity258 but that was a different strain from 1976			0
' they have mostly been contained to the @entity104 , @entity260 and @entity261			0
' that is why there was n't much interest in this outbreak at the start , because it was n't really a big issue			0
' all that changed this year			0

dr @entity16 , director general of @entity8 said there is no @entity31 vaccine because it had only affected poor @entity5 nations
speaking at the regional committee for @entity32 in @entity58 , she criticised drugs companies for turning their backs on ' markets that can not pay '
dr @entity56 said current outbreak had exposed two @entity8 arguments ' that have fallen on deaf ears for decades '
she highlighted an ' urgent need ' to strengthen @entity5 healthcare systems
professor @entity99 , who helped discover @entity31 in 1976 , warned the current outbreak will not be brought under control under there is a vaccine
two promising drugs are in development are there are trials taking place in the @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity34 with plans to extend them in @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216
first *safety* and efficacy results are expected by the end of next year
healthcare workers in @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 could receive the trial drugs as part of the second phase of trials in *january*
