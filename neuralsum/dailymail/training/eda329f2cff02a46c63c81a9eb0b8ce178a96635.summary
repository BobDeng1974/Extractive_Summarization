but @entity9 chiefs initially believed @entity10 would have a much better chance of tv stardom if he dumped @entity13 and went solo			2
the damning appraisal , delivered just two years before the duo finally found fame on commercial television , was discovered in the @entity9 ’s own archives			1
unwise words : initial reviews said @entity10 ( top ) should dump partner @entity13 in a letter to a scriptwriter dated june 5 , 1959 , @entity24 , one of the @entity26 ’s comedy producers who had previously worked with the stars on radio , ruled out a @entity30 argued they were ‘ stuck in a rut and too reliant on outdated gags ’			1
he wrote : ‘ after seeing @entity2 the other week in their show [ in ] @entity35 , i am not at all sure as to their strength on a tv programme			2
‘ they are still working to old gags and in my opinion , frequently working the wrong type of material			0
they are quite a disappointment to me because when i first worked with them in this region on sound , i thought they had a great future			0
‘ it is even more depressing than it seems because they are quite happy to jog along as they are doing at the moment			0
the damning appraisal was delivered two years before before the duo found fame on commercial television ‘ i always thought @entity10 was a funny man and still think that he could be very successful on vision but only if he could be detached from @entity13 , who i think is a big weakness			1
i really can not see them making the grade in a tv series			0
’ @entity2 , who began performing together in 1941 , enjoyed success on stage and radio , but initially struggled to make an impression on television			1
a 1954 @entity9 comedy show called @entity72 was panned by critics and led one reviewer to define a television set as ‘ the box they buried @entity2 in ’			1
other letters in the archives show that the duo feared that the failure of @entity72 would have a detrimental impact on their careers as live performers			2
they tried to quit the show before it had finished its run			0
in a letter dated june 17 , 1954 , the pair ’s agent , @entity89 , told @entity93 , the head of light entertainment : ‘ i called my clients into my office to see me this morning in view of the television broadcast they did last night and to say in my personal opinion this was the worst performance i have ever witnessed my clients giving , not because of their inability but plainly because the material etc supplied for them to appear in was most unsuitable and inadequate			1
‘ on behalf of my clients , i must refuse them being allowed to appear for the last of the six television broadcasts in their contract			0
you will appreciate my clients ’ main livelihood depends upon theatrical engagements and they can not possibly afford to jeopardise any further their reputation in this market			0
’ in a memo dated april 23 , 1954 , @entity93 said the show flopped because it was reliant ‘ on second - rate artists and fourth - rate writers ’			1
@entity2 eventually found fame on television in the hit 1961 show @entity122 , which was made by commercial broadcaster @entity123			1

ironically , given his earlier dismissal of the duo , @entity24 played a key role in the success of the show and is even credited with devising the famous dance routine that brought each episode to an end			0
the pair ’s subsequent partnership with comedy writer @entity151 produced some of the most memorable moments in television			2
he teamed the comics with @entity156 , who starred as @entity157 in ‘ a play wot @entity13 wrote ’ ; @entity159 , who tried to perform @entity160 in an evening dress and a pair of @entity10 ’s boots ; and @entity164 , who was given an unorthodox master class by @entity10			0
the @entity166 became the tv highlight of the year and the 1977 edition , which featured a dancing @entity170 and some of the @entity9 ’s best - known personalities in a tribute to the musical @entity173 attracted 28 million viewers .			0
