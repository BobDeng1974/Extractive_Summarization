the study found the more money a person has the happier they are whoever said money ca n't buy happiness was very wrong , new research has found			1
according to an economic study , the more money a person has , the happier they are			2
the latest study of 1,014 people contradicts previous research that said the correlation between money and happiness diminishes when the basic needs of a person are met			1
people were asked to rate their levels of happiness and their income was recorded			1
economists @entity21 and @entity23 say in their paper the may 2013 @entity25 that there is no evidence of a ' satiation ' point in the link between money and happiness			1
they wrote : ' while the idea that there is some critical level of income beyond which income no longer impacts well - being is intuitively appealing , it is at odds with the data			0
' everyone with an income of £ 306,250 a year or more classed themselves as ' very happy '			0
the @entity46 study found that all those earning £ 61,250 a year or more also described themselves as either very or fairly happy			1
however , only 35 per cent of people taking home £ 6,125 - the equivalent of $ 10,000 in the exchange rate used in the study - claimed they were happy			2
a total of 21 per cent in that income bracket said they were ' not too happy '			0
the economists wrote : ' the income - well - being link that one finds when examining only the poor , is similar to that found when examining only the rich ' , according to @entity60			2
they added : ' we find no evidence of a significant break in either the happiness - income relationship , nor in the life satisfaction - income relationship , even at annual incomes up to half a million dollars			0
' people with the lowest incomes were more likely to describe themselves as ' not too happy ' the latest study comes after a separate study found people who splash out on ‘ experiences ’ such as days out and concert tickets are happier than those who buy possessions			1
psychologists asked 9,600 people about their shopping habits , as well as questions to ascertain personality traits , values and life satisfaction			0
' experiential shoppers ' , who bought treats such as concern tickets or weekends away , rather than clothes or gadgets , reported greater life satisfaction , according to the study led by @entity91 assistant professor of psychology @entity92 .			0

@entity46 study found the richer people are happier
lowest earners more likely to describe themselves as ' not too happy '
found no ' satiation ' point when link between happiness and income changes
