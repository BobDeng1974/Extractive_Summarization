@entity0 , 64 , from @entity1 , @entity2 , has been warned she faces jail if she continues to harass her neighbours with their neatly trimmed hedges and well - kept gardens , on the surface these adjoining bungalows in a @entity2 village are tranquil havens for a peaceful retirement			1
but for five years a bitter feud has raged between retired teaching assistant @entity0 , 64 , and the former civil servants next door whom she accused of being jealous of her award - winning garden			1
@entity0 made the lives of @entity20 , 59 , and @entity21 , 65 , a misery by making disturbing threats against them , a court heard			1
it took a criminal conviction and the threat of jail to stop the harassment and bring an uneasy truce to this bizarre dispute			2
magistrates heard that @entity0 , a once ‘ respected member of the community ’ in @entity1 , @entity2 , claimed she was being ‘ stalked ’ and ‘ watched all the time ’ by the couple because they envied her gardening skills			2
police investigated and found no evidence to back up her allegations			0
instead , they took action against @entity43 for tormenting her neighbours after she threatened to ‘ hang ’ mr @entity20 from his tree last summer , @entity41 heard			1
@entity0 , who had previously won the village gardening competition , was prosecuted after mr @entity20 and @entity48 logged 11 threats of violence in just one month			2
she admitted harassment over a six - month period , and was ordered to pay a fine of £ 900 plus £ 130 costs and victim surcharge at a court hearing on october 29			1
@entity0 also had a restraining order imposed on her to prevent future harassment			1
passing sentence , district judge @entity59 told her : ‘ it ’s a sad situation indeed that a woman your age is before the court			0
if you continue to offend you will place yourself in prison			0
’ the home of @entity0 , who admitted to yelling abuse at her neighbours in @entity1 , @entity2 neighbour @entity71 , 59 ( left ) , said he and his partner endured a five - year reign of terror from @entity43 ( right ) @entity0 has previously won the @entity74 for her well - kept garden ( pictured ) mr @entity20 , from @entity76 ( above ) , said there had been no further incidents since the court hearing prosecutor @entity80 told the court the harassment included ‘ abuse and threatening language ’ aimed at the couple , whom @entity0 branded ‘ poisoned dwarves ’			1
she allegedly told mr @entity20 : ‘ i ’ll let you hang from that f * * * * * * tree and leave you to f * * * * * * dangle			2
’ she then added : ‘ i know you ’re watching me , i can see you when i ’m in my underwear			0
’ @entity0 continued the abusive rants across the hedge dividing the two gardens , despite receiving a conditional discharge for similar offences in december last year			1
her solicitor , @entity97 , said : ‘ she perceived herself to be the victim and still does , although she accepts that her actions have been absolutely appalling			0
’ after the hearing , mr @entity20 said : ‘ @entity0 has been harassing us for over five years			1
threats have included hanging us in the tree and having a good laugh , maiming us with an iron rod and spraying our eyes to blind us			0
‘ she has alleged i ’m a paedophile , a spy and that i leer into her house watching her in her underwear			0
’ speaking yesterday , he said : ‘ there have been no further incidents since the court case			0
we just hope that the police action has brought matters to an end			0
