@entity1 ’s @entity0 @entity3 's return was the answer to @entity1 ’s prayers			1
@entity3 said sunday 's game at the @entity7 was the best @entity1 had ever played			1
that was a pat on the back for his captain but also justification for @entity3 ’s faith in playing him			0
@entity1 is in a real purple patch and his reading of the game is better than ever			1
part of his success comes from the way the team is set up in front of him			0
all of their good work means he is in prime position each time to make the telling tackle or interception			0
@entity1 ( left ) was in inspiring form in the @entity30 defence as his side kept a clean sheet against @entity33 @entity35 's @entity34 says the @entity37 skipper is enjoying some of the best football of his career the 34 - year - old defender 's timing in the tackle has been impeccable for the majority this season his decision - making is excellent and he waits for the perfect moment to get involved — there can be an element of gambling with that but it is a calculated risk			1
he was always able to anticipate where @entity33 wanted to play the game and stop them from doing it			2
as @entity30 have become harder to beat , @entity1 has come into his own			2
following an entertaining first half , @entity33 's tempo appeared to drop after the half time break ghosts of @entity58 ? in the first half @entity33 played at a terrific tempo , especially down the left , but the whistle came at the perfect time for @entity30			1
after the break @entity33 did n’t move the ball quickly enough			2
they looked mindful of the @entity58 game where they lost control but here there was not enough spark			0
@entity72 striker @entity71 had a frustrating afternoon against a rugged @entity30 defence @entity75 's pace through the middle could have instead caused the @entity30 back line a lot trouble a missed opportunity i ’m a big fan of @entity71 but @entity33 needed to ask a different question of the @entity30 defence			1
@entity1 and @entity82 are built to deal with players like @entity71 and everything was played in front of them			1
if @entity75 had played through the middle , his pace could have unsettled @entity30			1
it ’s much easier to be compact when there ’s no threat in behind			0
the @entity33 supporters were heard lamenting @entity30 's ' boring ' performance at the @entity7 despite many questioning @entity30 's tactics in the big games @entity3 's team are in full control @entity97 always the boss the @entity33 fans said it was boring but @entity30 are doing what they need to do to see out a championship			1
there is no problem with that			0
if anything that element of control is something @entity33 would do well to copy			0
yes , there was no striker but could @entity112 really play three games in a row at 37 ? @entity3 just made good use of his squad			0
at the start of the season @entity30 played with so much expression it looked like the players were in charge			2
now they look dogged , disciplined and firmly in control			0
there is no doubt as to who is the boss now .			0

@entity34 : @entity75 's pace might have unsettled @entity30
@entity1 and @entity82 are built to deal with players like @entity71
@entity34 says @entity30 captain @entity1 's reading of the game is better than ever
the @entity33 fans said it was boring but @entity30 are doing what they need to do to win the league
@entity141 : @entity33 ca *n't* win title with @entity71 in *attack*
