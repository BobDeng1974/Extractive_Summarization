by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 08:39 est , 15 december 2012 if your @entity3 turkey turns out so dry that only drowning in gravy can rescue it , maybe it ’s time to change your cooking method			1
producers have come up with a new guide to producing a juicy and moist bird without the risk of food poisoning			1
it argues for a lower oven temperature , together with a shorter browning time and a longer resting period			0
this is because not all producers and supermarkets were happy to sign up in time to get the instructions on to their @entity3 packaging this year			1
the industry is also waiting for approval from the @entity36 , which must be satisfied the change does not create a food poisoning risk			0
the delay in going public will add to the confusion about how best to cook a turkey , which has been fuelled by celebrity chefs from @entity18 to @entity43 and @entity44			0
while @entity18 favours blasting the turkey at a high temperature and cooking it quickly , the others suggest that cooking the same bird could take as much as two hours longer			1
by the recipe : @entity51 producers recommend longer resting time and a lower temperature in order to achieve the perfect @entity3 dinner the @entity57 organisation represents all the major @entity3 suppliers including @entity59 , @entity61 foods , @entity62 and @entity63			1
its draft guidelines recommend a reduction in the cooking temperature from 190c to 180c for conventional ovens , and from 180c to 160c for fan ovens			0
@entity18 's opposite : @entity44 cooks his turkey 40 minutes longer than recommended by producers it also suggests removing the foil just 25 minutes before the end of the cooking time , rather than the current 40 minutes			1
there has also been a change to the recommended resting time – once the bird has been removed from the oven – with an increase from the current 15 - 20 minutes up to 20 - 30 minutes			2
the industry ’s recommended cooking times remain the same at 20 minutes per kilo plus 70 minutes for a turkey under 4kg , and 20 minutes per kilo plus 90 minutes for larger birds			0
under these rules a 6.5 kilo ( 14lb ) bird would take three hours and 40 minutes to cook			2
however , even this is far too conservative for @entity18 who believes the same turkey should be cooked at a higher temperature in just two hours 45 minutes			0
the main concern about opting for a short roasting time is simply that the bird will not cook through , allowing food poisoning bugs such as campylobacter and salmonella to survive			2
but @entity18 has always been unapologetic about her method , saying : ‘ the truth is we have all been overcooking our turkeys for years			0
’ the managing director of @entity59 , @entity103 , confirmed that most home cooks have erred on the side of caution by cooking their turkeys at a high temperature for longer than they need			0
but the chairman of the @entity112 ’s turkey section , @entity113 , defended the decision to delay announcing the new roasting advice			0
‘ due to the wide variety of turkey products available to consumers this @entity3 , it has not been possible to reach a consistent set of cooking guidelines across all retailers , ’ he said			1
‘ therefore , until further testing has been carried out to achieve this , we recommend consumers follow the existing guidance for cooking their @entity3 turkey			1
’ he said all ovens vary and cooks can confirm a bird is ready by piercing the thickest part of the thigh with a skewer to ensure the juices run clear .			2
