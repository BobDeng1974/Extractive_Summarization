@entity6 was rushed to @entity8 ’s @entity7 for an operation , in which the blood clot which caused the stroke was scooped out by a tube containing a tiny mesh basket			1
the tube was fed through her groin and into her brain with x-ray guidance			2
@entity6 the 65 - year - old said the ' amazing ' procedure - which immediately restored her speech and movement - had made her life worth living again			1
' i thought i would be unable to speak or move for the rest of my life but i was back to normal again just a few hours after the attack , ' @entity6 said			1
' @entity6 suffered a stroke at her home in @entity31 , @entity8 , in february			1
she was initially given @entity32 , a drug which contains a protein that breaks down blood clots			2
but , when that did n’t work , the medics mentioned the thrombectomy option			0
' i was awake on the operating table when they performed the procedure , ' she said			0
' i could n’t feel a thing and could n’t speak			0
when the basket got near the brain i heard an explosion , it almost felt like fireworks in my head			1
@entity6 ( right ) with daughter @entity49 , who did a charity skydive to raise money for the @entity52 ' i could n’t tell them what i thought because i had no voice			1
then seconds later it happened again			0
i must have winced and when the doctors asked if i was ok , i actually spoke and said ‘ yes ’			0
i could n’t believe it			0
' then i said : ‘ oh i can talk ’			2
it was because , at that split second , they caught the blood clot which was causing the blockage			1

the @entity67 is among only a handful of centres in the @entity70 to perform the procedure			0
it was first performed there in april last year and so far been used on five patients			0
