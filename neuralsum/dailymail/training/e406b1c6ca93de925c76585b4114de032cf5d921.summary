teachers who under - perform will have their salaries frozen under plans to end the system of national pay deals for classroom staff			1
annual rises for teachers will be scrapped and heads given almost complete freedom to dictate salary increases in the shake - up outlined in the @entity12			1
national pay scales which virtually guaranteed teachers annual £ 2,000 rises will be axed from next september			1
instead heads will award increases based on annual appraisals of performance in the classroom , allowing them to reward the best teachers and limit the pay of the least effective			1
collision course : mr @entity23 faces a backlash from unions , who branded the proposals ' unfair ' ( file image ) the reforms also mean that heads will be able to withhold the 1 per cent pay rise due for public sector workers in 2013/14 and 2014/15			1
only those on the lowest salaries in three broad pay bands will be guaranteed the increase			0
the move – which will be put out to consultation – strikes at the heart of national pay bargaining and severely weakens the power of teaching unions			1
ministers hope it will boost standards in the classroom			0
education secretary @entity47 said : ‘ these recommendations will make teaching a more attractive career and a more rewarding job			1
they will give schools greater flexibility to respond to specific conditions and reward their best teachers			1
’ chancellor @entity23 tells mps in his @entity12 today that headteachers will be given the power to pay teachers more if they perform better in the job than colleagues but union barons declared war over the ‘ disastrous ’ and ‘ cynical ’ proposals , raising the prospect of a fresh wave of strike action in schools			1
currently , teachers move up the main pay scale according to length of service in the classroom			2
the system has meant that long - serving but under - performing teachers are paid the same as more capable colleagues			1
under proposed reforms , heads would be able to promote a teacher from a £ 21,000 - a - year salary to £ 51,000 in just six months			1
the plans were unveiled by @entity23 following recommendations from the @entity85 ( @entity84 )			0
boost classroom standards : education secretary @entity47 , pictured with @entity87 ( left ) and @entity88 , says the recommendations ' will make teaching a more attractive career and a more rewarding job ' the chancellor said national pay arrangements for civil servants , prison officers and @entity97 staff will continue , but told @entity56 there would be greater flexibility for schools			1
‘ @entity101 does recommend much greater freedom for individual schools to set pay in line with performance , ’ he said			2
national pay negotiations will remain but agreed rises will no longer be guaranteed for the vast majority of staff			2
heads will instead have discretion over whether to pass the increases on			2
@entity114 , general secretary of @entity115 , said the independent @entity84 may have been ' leant on ' - a claim denied by the government however the chancellor appears to have abandoned plans for regional pay bargaining for schools , which could have meant that a teacher in the north - east was paid less than one in the south - east			1
under yesterday ’s proposals , detailed national pay scales for teachers will be ripped up and replaced with three broad pay bands – starting at £ 21,804 , £ 34,523 and £ 37,836 for teachers outside @entity130			2
while teachers will be protected from pay cuts , heads will have wide discretion to dictate salaries within each band based on classroom performance – including pupil results – and accelerate staff through the three levels			1
there is already an element of performance - related pay for more senior teachers , which will be strengthened and extended to all			0
the changes apply only to teachers , with pay arrangements for heads and deputies remaining largely unchanged			2
heads of state - funded academies and free schools already have the freedom to dictate teachers ’ pay			1
yesterday ’s proposals apply to the majority of schools which operate under the auspices of local authorities			0
@entity114 , general secretary of the @entity115 union , said the independent @entity84 may have been ‘ leant on ’ – a claim denied by the government			1
‘ the war on teachers waged by the @entity165 continues , ’ she said			0
‘ if implemented , the @entity84 ’s recommendations would leave behind the wreckage of a national pay framework which will be incapable of delivering consistent , fair and transparent approaches to pay			0
’ teacher @entity172 says the reforms announced by the chancellor yesterday were already in operation in many academy schools in @entity177			2
miss @entity172 , 40 , right , is a primary school teacher in @entity178 , @entity179 , and has taught children of varying ages during a 15 - year career			0
miss @entity172 , who is on the upper pay scale two , said the effectiveness of @entity23 ’s reforms will depend on the ability of the head teacher at each school			0
she said : ‘ this could work but only if there are good head teachers to implement it			0
in some schools there certainly are those who are fair			0
‘ but in others it could be used to get rid of teachers who the head would like to replace			0
‘ it really does depend on the head teacher			0
i do not think that would necessarily be fair			0
‘ it is already commonplace in academy schools but not in those run by the local education authority			2
’ miss @entity172 added : ‘ i have already proved that i am a very good teacher by reaching the upper pay scale			0
it would not be right for me to be paid less at a different school if i have already been judged to be worth that amount			0

chancellor gives heads power to reward teachers if they perform better than their colleagues
annual rises for teachers will be scrapped and heads given almost complete freedom to dictate salary increases
@entity115 union : ' it will be **bad** for children *'s* education and **bad** for the teaching *profession* '
unions warn that there will be a fresh wave of strike action in schools
