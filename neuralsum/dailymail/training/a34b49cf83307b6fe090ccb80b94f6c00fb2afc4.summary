@entity0 used @entity2 's dead - rubber clash with @entity3 to show off the club 's young diamonds and , on this showing , the @entity2 may have unearthed a real gem			1
boasting one of @entity10 's finest left backs in @entity11 , @entity2 appear to have a more than able deputy waiting in the wings			0
@entity14 has possibly one of the most difficult jobs in football on his hands in trying to usurp @entity11 from the @entity2 first - team but on thursday night the defender showed he is more than capable of holding his own on the big stage			1
defender @entity14 was @entity2 's best player as the @entity2 lost 1 - 0 to @entity3 in the @entity23 first - team left back @entity11 ( centre ) watches @entity14 in action at @entity27 on thursday night @entity28 ( left ) was another @entity2 youngster to be given a chance to impress against the @entity31 side follow all the latest # @entity23 action on : @entity33 : @entity34 @entity35 : @ @entity36 and at @entity10 arriving at the club from @entity39 as a 16 - year - old in 2009 for a fee of £ 600,000 , @entity37 will have heard @entity14 's name from time to time as ' one for the future ' but have rarely had a chance to see him play until now			1
with @entity46 under 21s manager @entity45 casting his eye over the @entity49 ' youngsters here at @entity27 , @entity14 will have certainly caught his attention			0
helping to keep a clean sheet in the @entity2 ' 2 - 0 victory over @entity53 , @entity14 gave a composed and assured performance way beyond his years last month			1
once again , in his second @entity23 start , the defender looked a natural			0
dependable and sturdy at the back , it was @entity14 's lung - busting runs forward and pinpoint crossing which really got the @entity2 faithful excited			1
positionally sound , the @entity64 - born full back was full of running and showed great confidence striding forward and , at one point , appeared to rob the ball off the more experienced @entity68 on the wing as the @entity70 pondered what to do next			0
left back @entity14 bursts through @entity3 's defence on a rain - soaked night at @entity27 @entity2 boss @entity0 ( right ) gives @entity14 some advice on his second start for the club @entity14 faces the unenviable task of trying to take @entity11 ' ( right ) spot in @entity2 's starting xi pass accuracy : 82 per cent chances created : 4 take - ons completed : 3 constantly looking to make things happen , @entity14 's intention every time he received the ball was to march towards the byline and cross for the frontmen			1
with pinpoint accuracy , this was n't a player aimlessly lofting the ball into the area – @entity14 knew exactly where to put it			0
curling crosses , pull backs , drilling the ball , the full back mixed it up and his deliveries kept the @entity3 defence guessing throughout			0
the initiative showed will certainly please manager @entity0 and @entity14 , who spent a portion of last season on loan at @entity106 , has certainly benefited from having a player like @entity11 to learn from			2
it is a big ask to get ahead of the @entity46 left back , the player who has assisted so many goals – and scored a few himself , too – for @entity2 over the past few years but @entity14 certainly has the capabilities to play in the @entity111			2
as @entity0 's team evolves @entity14 may in fact get his chance with @entity11 still in the side			2
the @entity116 has admitted in the past that @entity2 's current @entity118 could follow in the footsteps of @entity120 and move to midfield which would allow @entity14 a chance			2
for the first time ever , the @entity23 winners will play in the @entity126 next term and while @entity0 will strive to pick his strongest xi from here on in , this competition may be the platform for @entity14 to shine on as the @entity2 continue into the knockout stages on the road to @entity133			1
versatile defender @entity134 ( left ) was given a start after impressing in two substitute appearances former @entity39 full back @entity14 is fouled @entity3 's @entity138 after a powerful run forward @entity140 ( left ) came off the bench early on to make his senior @entity2 debut at the age of just 17 with the @entity146 's progress ensured before kick - off , the youngster certainly got @entity2 fans talking and was a high point on a night when an opportunity for the club 's academy lads was more important than the result supporters , including @entity155 and @entity156 - showing real commitment travelling all the way up from @entity159 to @entity160 for a fixture with nothing riding on it - were excited at the prospect at seeing @entity2 's academy crop in action			1
despite the 1 - 0 defeat , @entity0 's decision to blood the youngsters paid dividends			1
seeing the next generation of @entity49 performing so confidently in a competitive fixture has given @entity172 reason to be cheerful about the future			0
@entity134 stuck to his defensive duties well , 17 - year - old midfielder @entity28 was confident and tidy in possession while @entity177 was constantly looking to make things happen playing behind @entity179 as well as out wide			0
however , @entity14 was the one who stood out			0
@entity2 have a real player on their hands and the left back would not look out of place in the first - team .			0
