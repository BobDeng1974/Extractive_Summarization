@entity1 return to @entity2 on tuesday after a 16 - day tour of @entity4 which saw them win three and lose two of their five matches on @entity4 soil			1
it ended on a low with defeat to bitter rivals @entity12 in the final of the @entity14 in @entity15 but there were plenty of positives along the way			1
the fearless teenage winger was @entity1 's outstanding performer on the tour			1
he scored against both @entity31 and @entity32 , and tormented @entity12 during the opening 45 minutes before their second - half fightback			2
@entity26 , equally at home out wide or in a central role , now possesses the tactical intelligence to go with his blistering pace			2
he scored 10 @entity40 goals last season and looks capable of significantly improving that return to help @entity1 fill the void created by @entity45 's move to @entity46			1
one to watch : @entity26 continues to impress after coming of age in the @entity40 last season 2 talking of special players , @entity1 boast another top class talent in @entity23			1
the little @entity51 was devastated to miss out on the @entity53 finals in his homeland but that hurt appears to be firing him on to greater heights			0
@entity23 's trickery and eye for a pass was a feature of the club 's pre-season matches in the @entity65			2
the only thing lacking has been a finishing touch			0
@entity68 has revealed that the little @entity51 will be rewarded for his impact with a lucrative new contract to ensure @entity1 fend off interest from clubs across @entity73			2
magic : @entity23 missed out on the @entity53 but is making up for lost time with @entity1 3 @entity1 desperately need to sign another striker			1
@entity68 has been busy in the transfer market this summer with @entity79 right - back @entity78 set to be the club 's seventh signing			0
however , they still look short of firepower			0
@entity84 ( hamstring ) and @entity86 ( shoulder ) both left the tour early due to injuries and that left @entity91 as the club 's only fit senior striker			0
@entity91 is clearly still adjusting to life at @entity95 and was n't able to open his account – missing a penalty against @entity98 and fluffing a great chance against @entity12			1
@entity26 and @entity23 will chip in but @entity68 needs someone who can guarantee him 20 goals a season			1
@entity103 no concern - @entity68 support : @entity84 is @entity1 's best striker but the club must replace @entity45 4 there is absolutely no chance of @entity108 resurrecting his @entity95 career			1
the @entity110 joined @entity1 on the tour after spending last season on loan at @entity114			2
however , he trained away from the main group during most sessions and was n't even named among the substitutes for any of the matches			0
with @entity122 now the club 's undisputed no 1 , the writing is on the wall for @entity108 and @entity1 are desperate to get him off the wage bill			1
his £ 110,000 per week salary has put off rival clubs with @entity114 unwilling to match that amount and pay the £ 4million transfer fee			0
it 's a situation @entity1 need to resolve quickly			0
no future : @entity108 looks set to leave @entity95 but his wages are proving a stumbling block for his suitors 5 @entity68 ' faith in youth is well documented and @entity1 boast another teenager who looks capable of lighting up the @entity40			1
@entity137 is exactly a year younger than @entity26 and is on course to follow in his footsteps			0
the 18 - year - old has clearly benefited from a loan spell at @entity142 last season and he was hugely impressive in the win against @entity98 in @entity145			0
he 's quick , strong and robust – as demonstrated by the manner in which the @entity148 ' rough treatment failed to disrupt him			0
the question for @entity68 is whether to keep @entity137 as an impact player this season or send him out on loan where his development would be aided by playing week in week out			0
bright future : @entity137 looks to be the next talented player to come off the @entity95 conveyor belt video positives heading into new season - @entity68			2

@entity1 lost the @entity14 final to @entity12
@entity26 and @entity23 impressed during the tour
@entity1 need to sign another striker to replace @entity45
@entity108 looks to have no future at @entity95
