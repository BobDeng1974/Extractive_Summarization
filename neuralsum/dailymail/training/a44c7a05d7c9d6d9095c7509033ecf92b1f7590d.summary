their @entity0 could not have been any more contrasting - @entity2 surrendered their crown by bombing out in the group stages while @entity5 went all the way , beating @entity7 in the @entity9 final			1
four months on , ahead of their friendly in @entity13 , we assess what 's happened to both nations since the summer and whether they 've progressed or gone backwards			1
@entity5 captain @entity17 lifts the @entity18 after their 1 - 0 win over @entity7 in the @entity9 final @entity20 runs away in celebration after scoring his extra time winner against @entity7 in the final @entity2 , by contrast , were a shadow of their former selves and crashed out in the @entity18 group stage @entity29 and @entity30 react gloomily after @entity2 lost 2 - 0 to @entity31 at the @entity18 the results @entity2 @entity2 fell to their first qualification defeat in eight years when they lost to @entity36 last month and coming after a miserable 1 - 0 loss to @entity38 in a friendly straight after the @entity18 the gloom has taken a time to lift			1
but beating @entity42 4 - 0 and @entity43 3 - 0 in their last two games have restored faith that while things will never be quite the same again , @entity2 can go into @entity38 2016 as one of the favourites for the tournament			2
much of the renewed excitement comes from the performance of @entity53 in that last game			0
@entity2 lost their first qualification match in eight years against @entity36 last month @entity2 currently sit behind @entity36 in @entity59 qualifying @entity57 @entity5 after the euphoric high of winning the @entity18 out in @entity62 , a hangover was always to be expected and so it has proved			1
@entity7 , who were beaten by @entity20 's extra time goal in the final , gained a small measure of revenge when they won 4 - 2 in a @entity70 friendly back in august			2
@entity5 trailed 4 - 0 at one stage , with @entity72 in exceptional form			2
qualifying for the @entity75 started in a similarly unconvincing vein as they scraped past @entity78 2 - 1 thanks to a couple of @entity82 goals before a few shortcomings were exposed in a 2 - 0 loss to @entity85			1
@entity86 was left fuming after @entity89 's stoppage time goal earned the @entity90 a point in their third qualifier and there were still a few murmurings of discontent when @entity5 ' only ' put four past minnows @entity97 the other night			1
@entity89 ( left ) celebrates his last - minute equaliser for the @entity90 against @entity5 last month @entity5 find themselves behind @entity85 four matches in to qualifying @entity101 manager @entity2 @entity103 kept his job after a @entity18 campaign that he himself described as disastrous			1
now he has to prove that he is the best man to help @entity2 to defend the @entity108 crown they won under his management in 2012			2
he is fiercely loyal by nature so there has been a tendency toward evolution over revolution but slowly but surely the new @entity2 is taking shape			2
in @entity38 2016 he , along with the likes of @entity30 , @entity29 and @entity118 want a glorious swan - song that will erase memories of that @entity62 nightmare			0
@entity103 kept his job as @entity2 coach despite the @entity18 debacle and must now rebuild @entity5 @entity5 's triumph out in @entity62 was a glorious vindication of @entity86 's philosophy and methods , but the manager has been frustrated by the fall in standards since			1
low , a perfectionist , has seen his team affected by somewhat inevitable lapses in concentration since their @entity9 win and restoring professional focus is his no 1 priority			0
the expanded format for @entity139 has n't helped his cause , with @entity5 pretty much assured of qualification whatever they do			0
it must be a massive comedown to play these routine qualifiers after the high - pressure games of the @entity18			0
the @entity18 - winning squad have naturally assumed a huge celebrity profile - as shown by the red carpet premiere of ' @entity5 ' , a film about their @entity62 triumph , in @entity152 this week - and @entity86 's greatest challenge now is to ensure they keep their minds on the football			1
@entity86 has been far from impressed by @entity5 's performances since their @entity18 triumph players @entity2 it was @entity103 who persuaded @entity161 to switch allegiance ; the @entity164 born striker has not made it easy for his manager since then			1
first he failed to score at the @entity18 , then having taken a total of 515 minutes to get off the mark he pulls out of the next squad , despite being fit to play for @entity171 against @entity172			0
for now @entity103 is sticking with the idea of building the team around him with young talents such as @entity176 ’s @entity53 and @entity178 ’s @entity177 in a supporting role			2
@entity181 ’s @entity180 also has a huge role having been handed the ‘ @entity183 ’ in midfield			0
striker @entity161 took 515 minutes to score his first goal for @entity2 , in contrast to his @entity171 form @entity176 's @entity53 has impressed and offered optimism that @entity2 's golden era might not yet be over @entity5 there were always going to be some players wanting to end their international careers on a high and stalwarts @entity17 , @entity194 and @entity195 all announced their retirements			1
@entity197 , appointed @entity17 's successor as captain , has been on the sidelines with a knee injury and has only just returned to training with @entity203			0
but though these pillars of the side have been absent , @entity5 are not exactly short of world class talent and @entity86 has started to bring a few new players through			1
with @entity210 injured at the start of the season , his @entity209 clubmate @entity208 has been deployed and left - back @entity213 , also of @entity209 , has been given his chance too			0
@entity216 , who started the @entity18 final after @entity219 's injury only to be himself taken off with a head injury , has added to his caps			2
low has also used @entity224 midfielder @entity223 and has great faith in @entity227 winger @entity226 , who has started the last three qualifiers			0
other more established names have been ineffective , including the out - of - luck @entity230 and @entity232 , both of whom failed to get on the scoresheet against @entity97			0
@entity226 has become a regular starter for @entity5 since the @entity18 out - of - sorts forward @entity230 was n't able to get on the scoresheet against minnows @entity97 the future @entity2 going into the next big tournament with @entity240 or @entity30 in goal ; @entity176 ’s @entity242 and @entity244 ’s @entity243 at full - backs ; and @entity246 alongside @entity247 in the centre of defence should give the @entity250 a solid base on which to build			1
@entity252 and @entity180 look set to become the new midfield pairing with @entity161 leading the line in attack			0
and in the line of three behind the striker @entity103 still has enough players for two teams with with @entity53 , @entity177 , @entity260 , @entity29 , @entity118 and @entity261 all available to him			0
it ’s still a squad to envy and if the right balance can be found between the old and the new @entity38 2016 could yet belong to the @entity250			0
@entity180 , seen here in action against @entity43 on saturday , has established himself in the @entity2 midfield @entity177 ( left ) is one of a number of exciting attacking options @entity103 can call upon @entity5 with an eye on the future , @entity86 is set to promote under - 21 captain and @entity224 striker @entity273 , and @entity275 defender @entity274 for the @entity2 match			1
@entity5 's talent pool runs deep and if the big names continue to mis - fire , there are plenty ready to pounce and take their place			2
some changes for the match in @entity13 have been forced , with @entity285 , @entity286 and @entity287 all out			0
however , @entity86 has been far from satisfied with some of the contributions of his fringe players and demanded they step it up in a blast after the @entity97 match			0
the whole team still seems to be struggling with the return to the mundane day job after their @entity18 glory and @entity86 needs to inspire them again			1
@entity273 is set for a start for @entity5 in their friendly with @entity2 after a cameo against @entity97			1
