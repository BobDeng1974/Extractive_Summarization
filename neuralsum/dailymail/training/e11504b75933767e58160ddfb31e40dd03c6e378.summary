one of the great mysteries shrouding the origins of life on @entity3 is how complex organisms began to take shape			1
theory should hold that ‘ short ’ fragments of genetic material would have reproduced in abundance , leaving longer strands - and thus complex life - behind			1
but new research has revealed that longer strands may have thrived in volcanic ' pores ' on the young @entity3 - ultimately allowing life to evolve to the complexity we see today			1
researchers from @entity18 ( @entity18 ) in @entity19 have attempted to solve one of the paradoxes of the origins of life			1
they say that complex life could have gained a foothold in hydrothermal vents ( stock image shown ) in the early @entity3 , billions of years ago the research was carried out by a team from the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) in @entity19 and published in the journal @entity30			1
they found that water - filled micropores in hot rocks may have acted as the nurseries in which life on @entity3 began			1
in october 2014 researchers from @entity37 found an unusual glimpse of the beginning of @entity3 deep in a @entity41 volcano			2
known as hotspots , volcanic island chains such as @entity43 can have ancient primordial signatures from the early solar system that have somehow survived billions of years			0
researchers now say they have found unique chemical signatures that show them what conditions were like			0
the geochemists said they found evidence of @entity3 's early formation still trapped inside the volcanic hotspots			2
one crucial precondition for the origin of life is that comparatively simple biomolecules must have had opportunities to form more complex structures			0
these , in turn , had to be capable of reproducing themselves , storing genetic information in a chemically stable form			0
creating longer strands of @entity65 to store this genetic information would have been essential - but it simply would n’t have been possible in most conditions on @entity3			1
but @entity18 physicists led by dr @entity70 now describe a setting which provides the necessary conditions			0
they showed experimentally that pore systems on the seafloor that were heated by volcanic activity , namely hydrothermal vents , could have served as reaction chambers for this @entity65			1
the research was carried out by a team from the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) in @entity19 and published in the journal @entity30			2
they found that water - filled micropores in hot rocks - from volcanic activity ( stock image shown ) - may have acted as the nurseries in which life on @entity3 began no one is quite sure how complex genetic material came to be			1
in theory , ' short ' strands of @entity65 ( illustrated ) should have thrived in the early @entity3 - at the expense of longer strands			1
this new theory , though , provides a possible explanation for how we ultimately evolved on the planet to do this they used tiny glass capillary tubes to simulate the pores found in rocks			0
heating the tubes showed that longer strands of @entity65 became trapped in the pore			1
‘ the key requirement is that the heat source be localised on one side of the elongated pore , so that the water on that side is significantly warmer than that on the other , ’ said dr @entity70			0
biomolecules that were washed into the pore could then be trapped , and concentrated , by the high temperature - forming longer polymers			0
this was important for the evolution of @entity65 and @entity119 , as it enabled more genetic information to be stored in longer molecules			2
thus , the @entity18 group has succeeded in constructing a system which permits autonomous and continuous @entity126 evolution of ever more complex biomolecules - defining realistic conditions under which life could in principle have evolved			2
' life is fundamentally a thermodynamic non-equilibrium phenomenon			0
that is why the emergence of the first life - forms requires a local imbalance driven by an external energy source - for example , by a temperature difference imposed from outside the system , ' dr @entity70 explained			0
' that this can be achieved in such a simple and elegant way was surprising even to us			0
the success of the project is a tribute to the close cooperation between all members of the team			0

researchers from @entity18 ( @entity18 ) in @entity19 have attempted to solve one of the paradoxes of the origins of life
namely , no one is quite sure how complex genetic material came to be
in theory , ' short ' strands of @entity65 should have thrived in the early @entity3 - at the expense of longer strands
but the *scientists* found long strands could survive in hydrothermal vents
these volcanic pores could have provided a ' nursery ' for complex life
