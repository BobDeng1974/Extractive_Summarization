conservative - run @entity7 has approved the money for a major revamp of the boat - officially known as @entity12 - in this year 's budget			1
but it has provoked controversy after the council made £ 100m savings over the last two years and axed 1,700 jobs			1
controversial : @entity7 has approved money for revamp of @entity12 , pictured , despite making £ 100m savings over the last two years and axed 1,700 jobs the cuts included closing two libraries which are now run by volunteers			1
@entity26 council acquired the veteran monitor gunboat in 1990 when disgraced former @entity29 leader @entity28 was in charge			2
it is one of only two @entity34 @entity5 ships still surviving and is now berthed in dry dock at @entity36 , near @entity39 's flagship @entity37			0
culture secretary @entity40 praised the project on a recent visit			0
but councillor @entity43 , @entity43 opposition spokesman for recreation and heritage , said ' i am surprised that the council , which is cutting libraries , museums and galleries , can yet find such a large amount to spend on a ship which is certainly of historical interest but surely there are more worthwhile projects			1
' i would much rather see the money spent on restoring the book fund and keeping open small libraries and galleries which are under threat of closure			1
' not happy : councillor @entity43 , pictured , said he is surprised that the council is funding the restoration project the council has refused to say how much it has already spent restoring the former rusting hulk to her original external 1915 - 1919 condition			2
built in 1915 , @entity12 saw active service in the @entity68 throughout the @entity5 and provided support for the landing of @entity72 forces during the @entity74 campaign of 1915 - 16			1
after the war , she served a variety of purposes , including fuelling hulk , floating workshop and office			0
in 1997 , the county museum service placed her in dry docks for extensive works to stabilise hull corrosion			0
other repairs have included new masts , internal structural works and making her hull watertight			0
nearly all the fittings , anchors and gun shields were made from scratch			0
the latest refit is a joint project with the @entity97 of the @entity98 to mark the 100th anniversary of the @entity74 campaign in 1915			0
it will mean visitors can step on board the historic vessel and see inside - currently the gunboat can only be viewed from the dockside			0
culture and recreation chief councillor @entity107 defended the expenditure			0
he said ' the county council saved and restored the @entity12 warship , which is one of only two surviving @entity5 ships , and it will now become an even more popular public attraction as the nation remembers the 1914 - 18 war when it celebrates the centenary of that war			1
' councillor @entity107 said the county council was in discussion with @entity97 of the @entity98 to secure funding from the @entity123 for future works			0

@entity132 was also shut last year but reopened the following day as a community library run by the parish council and @entity135			2
