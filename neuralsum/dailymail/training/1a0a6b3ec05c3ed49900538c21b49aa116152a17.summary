by @entity0 @entity1 , local government secretary , proposes residents could get right to change yellow lines residents could get the right to challenge yellow lines on their roads , under proposals to be announced by @entity1 today			1
he is suggesting that if at least 50 members of the public or local businesses , or up to 10 per cent of people in an area , are against yellow lines in their neighbourhood , then they should be able to petition for a formal review			2
the local government secretary , who is known to be against ‘ over-zealous ’ parking policies , said he hoped local authorities would comply or he would force them to do so by law			1
mr @entity1 said the right to review would also apply to ‘ unfair parking charges ’ or any other aspect of parking policy , which is having a negative impact on an area			1
he has blamed expensive and restrictive parking policies for the decline of small shops in town centres			1
‘ too often , yellow lines are imposed on neighbourhoods or the high street , without fair consideration of the livelihood of residents , local shops or the availability of parking spaces , ’ mr @entity1 said			1
he added : ‘ now local people will have a direct and democratic right to trigger a formal council - led review of road restrictions			2
‘ @entity48 yellow lines , @entity45 spy cars and trigger - happy parking wardens make everyday life unbearable for drivers looking for somewhere to park when shopping locally			0
’ the right to a petition will apply from january next year if a review of parking guidelines , which will be taking evidence until october , backs the idea			1
last year mr @entity1 tried to legislate to allow people to park on double yellow lines for up to 15 minutes , saying they might want to pop in to the shops for a loaf of bread and should not be penalised			1
but he was forced to drop the idea in june after a consultation concluded it would be confusing			0
road safety groups said it could be dangerous			0
he has managed to ban cctv ‘ spy cars ’ from enforcing on - street parking rules			0
the @entity68 is against mr @entity1 ’ latest proposals			2
a spokesman said : ‘ councils already listen carefully to their residents , road users and businesses , consulting widely on parking schemes			0
‘ central government meddling will simply make achieving balanced and sensible outcomes much harder			0
‘ the government recently did a u-turn and dropped its plans to allow “ grace periods ” on double yellow lines			0
we sincerely hope this announcement follows the same route			0
’ he suggests that if at least 50 members of the public or local businesses , or up to 10 per cent of people in an area , are against yellow lines in their neighbourhood , then they should be able to petition for a formal review			2
