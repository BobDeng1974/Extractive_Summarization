by @entity0 published : 02:01 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 03:35 est , 24 september 2013 women who have had mastectomies to decrease their risk of developing breast cancer have dared to bare by posing naked for a charity calendar			1
many of the 25 women involved in the photo shoot are confirmed carriers of a faulty gene - @entity10 - putting them at greater risk of hereditary breast cancer			1
@entity14 , 28 , from @entity15 , is one of the women who agreed to strip off to raise funds for the @entity18			2
confidence boost : @entity14 had a preventative mastectomy in march and said posing for the charity calendar helped her post-op self - esteem calendar girls : @entity24 from @entity25 , left , and @entity26 from @entity27 dared to bare to raise money for the @entity18 the mother - of - one told the @entity30 earlier this year how she had taken the decision to have a mastectomy after finding out she is a carrier of the deadly @entity10 gene			1
her mother had developed breast cancer when she was a teenager ( she since recovered after treatment ) and her aunt died last year in her fifties after contracting ovarian cancer			1
raising awareness : most of the women involved in the calendar are carriers of the brca gene shattering the taboo : @entity48 from @entity49 , left , and @entity50 from @entity51 want to show women with a family history of breast cancer that they are not alone after seeing what her mother and aunt went through , @entity14 said she would hate for her own daughter , @entity58 , 22 months , to see her battling cancer			1
she said : ' i saw my mum suffer from cancer growing up , it 's really hard to see someone you love like that			0
' i do n't want my daughter to see me suffering			0
as soon as i found out i carried the gene , it was a not a case of ' if ' but ' when ' i would have a mastectomy			0
having it now means @entity58 will be too young to remember any of it			0
' with the support of her family , friends and partner , @entity77 , @entity14 had the operation in march and chose to have implants fitted at the same time			2
women from all over the country , including @entity82 from @entity83 , pictured , took part in the shoot brave : @entity88 from @entity89 , left , and @entity90 from @entity91 on @entity87 stripped off for charity she said it took her five weeks to recover and at first she felt self - conscious about her new body			0
but when she found out the @entity18 were looking for models to pose in their calendar , she decided to volunteer			0
she was supported by the construction company @entity97 who sponsored her to take part so that all proceeds of the production of the calendar can go to charity			2
@entity14 said it was n't easy baring all in front of the cameras			0
she said : ' i was so nervous			0
it was really nerve - racking but the team at @entity110 were great at putting us at ease			0
taking part has really boosted my confidence and it was great to meet the other women who have been through the same experience as me			1
inspirational : @entity119 from @entity120 and @entity121 from @entity122 feature in the £ 10 calendar ' having a mastectomy can be a taboo subject and a lot of people still do n't understand why women do it if they carry the brca gene			2
i hope this calendar proves having a mastectomy does n't make you less of a woman or less beautiful			2
' the 24 hour @entity135 was founded 20 years ago by @entity136 , who was one of the first women in the country to have preventative surgery after discovering nine out of 12 women in her family had suffered from breast cancer			1
a genetic link to cancer had not been proven at the time but was then discovered in the early 1990s thanks to the work of geneticist @entity148			0
fundraiser : @entity150 from @entity151 is miss june three generations : @entity136 , who founded the breast cancer charity helpline after her own mastectomy , with her daughter @entity156 and granddaughter @entity156 ' there is so much more awareness about hereditary breast cancer nowadays , ' said @entity136 , referring to how celebrities such as @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 have helped bring the subject to attention after making public their decision to have preventative mastectomies			1
she added : ' when i had my operation doctors still needed convincing that breast cancer could be hereditary , let alone given the choice of different options of surgery			1
' with the 2014 calendar , the charity hopes they can ' not only to dispel the myth that mastectomies are horrendous and make you less of a woman , but also to show others with a family history that not only are they not alone , they do have options			0
' the models , whose ages range from 20s to 50s , came from all regions of the @entity189			0
they all have a connection with the brca gene and were prepared to bare all to inspire @entity194 calendar is available to buy for £ 10 from @entity195 @entity10 and @entity196 are human genes that belong to a class known as tumor suppressors			2
mutation of these genes has been linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer a woman 's risk of developing breast and / or ovarian cancer is greatly increased if she inherits a @entity10 or @entity196 mutation			1
men with these mutations also have an increased risk of breast cancer gene faults are extremely rare with only about 1 in 20 cases of breast cancer associated with a faulty inherited gene if women have concerns about their family history of breast cancer , they should go see their gp			1
if their family history suggests they might be at increased risk of developing breast cancer , the @entity220 may refer them on to a specialist family history or genetics service where their options for genetic testing and / or managing their risk can be discussed			1
