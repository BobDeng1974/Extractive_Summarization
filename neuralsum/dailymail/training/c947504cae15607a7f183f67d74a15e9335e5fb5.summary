by @entity0 last updated at 1:45 pm on 9th august 2011 it killed 15,000 people and caused the worst nuclear disaster in 25years			2
but now it turns out that the effects of the @entity8 tsunami which struck the country in march were felt as far away as the @entity10			2
the wake of the giant wave travelled 8,000miles through the @entity14 until it battered a 260ft tall wall of ice at the southern tip of @entity18			1
as a result several enormous chunks , one of which was the size of @entity23 in @entity24 , broke off and drifted away into the sea			0
it was pieced together by researchers who studied @entity43 pictures of @entity18 to map the path of the wave during the 18 hours it took to cross the globe			1
using the satellite images the researchers were able to see the ice sheet calving , or breaking off , in near real time			1
the @entity53 ice shelf , which has barely moved in nearly 50 years , was put under so much strain by the powerful wave that vast chunks dropped off			1
iceberg in the @entity10 : researchers who studied @entity43 pictures of @entity18 to map the path of the wave during the 18 hours it took to cross the globe ( file picture ) the wave was just 1ft high there but there was so much force it had a huge effect			1
lead researcher @entity69 , a cryosphere specialist at @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity73 , said : ‘ in the past , we 've had calving events where we 've looked for the source			0
‘ it 's a reverse scenario - we see a calving and we go looking for a source			0
‘ we knew right away this was one of the biggest events in recent history - we knew there would be enough swell			0
and this time we had a source			0
’ tragedy : the wave from a tsunami crashes over a street in north - eastern @entity8 in march , after the magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck the area , killing 15,000 people the earthquake which hit @entity8 on march 11 caused waves up to 130ft that went up to six miles inland			1
entire towns and villages were wiped off the map as the waves crashed onto the land in terrifying footage that was captured and posted on the internet by survivors			0
the wave also caused a meltdown at the @entity106 which it is feared has left thousands with radiation poisoning			2
the research was published in the online edition of the @entity110 .			0
