by @entity0 published : 06:30 est , 9 january 2014 updated : 06:30 est , 9 january 2014 there are only enough honeybees in @entity5 to properly pollinate a quarter of the country ’s crops , scientists claim			1
destruction of huge swathes of grassland and the use of agricultural chemicals have caused a spiralling drop in the populations of honeybees , which are vital for food production			1
professor @entity17 of the @entity18 , who led the research project , said : ‘ we face a catastrophe in future years unless we act now			1
’ destruction of huge swathes of grassland and the use of agricultural chemicals have caused a spiralling drop in the populations of honeybees , which are vital for food production the research , published in the journal @entity28 , found that @entity29 has 13.4million too few honeybee colonies to properly pollinate all its crops			1
bee populations have plummeted as their meadowland habitats were concreted over and their wildflower food supply killed by herbicides			0
previous studies have estimated that the number of @entity5 honeybees have halved over the last 25 years			2
scientists think the bee shortfall is leading to reduced crop yields and they warn that in future farmers may have to look at mechanical or hand pollination			0
professor @entity17 added : ‘ wild pollinators need greater protection			0
research by the @entity18 found that @entity29 has 13.4million too few honeybee colonies to properly pollinate all its crops			1
the maps show the capacity of national honeybee colonies to supply demand for pollination services , in 2005 ( e ) and 2010 ( f ) ‘ they are the unsung heroes of the countryside , providing a critical link in the food chain for humans and doing work for free that would otherwise cost @entity5 farmers £ 1.8billion to replace			1
’ overall , the 41 @entity29 countries studied have only two - thirds of the honeybees they need			2
but the problem is particularly acute in @entity5 , where there are only 275,000 colonies – a quarter of the one million colonies needed to maximise yields			0
a bee colony can vary in size from 20,000 to 60,000 bees			0
professor @entity17 said the demand for insect pollinators is increasing as demand grows , particularly for oil crops such as oilseed rape and sunflowers			0
previous studies have said that the number of @entity5 honeybees have halved over the last 25 years			0
scientists think the bee shortfall is leading to reduced crop yields and they warn that in future farmers may have to look at mechanical or hand pollination he said : ‘ farmers are encouraged to grow oil crops , yet there is not enough joined - up thinking about how to help the insects that will pollinate them			2
‘ we need a proper strategy across @entity29 to conserve wild bees and pollinators through habitat protection , agricultural policy and farming methods – or we risk big financial losses to the farming sector and a potential food security crisis			1
’ dr @entity104 , who conducted the research , said insect pollinators add £ 37million a year to the value in increased yields of just two varieties of @entity5 apples .			0
