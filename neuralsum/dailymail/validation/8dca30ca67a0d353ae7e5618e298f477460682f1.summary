it may look like a stunning rainbow of colour , but the psychedelic hue of this hot spring in @entity5 , is a result of years of unintended vandalism by visitors			1
once a brilliant shade of blue , the @entity10 's appearance has altered dramatically since the 1950s , thanks to an accumulation of coins , rubbish and natural debris			2
the pool has been dubbed the @entity19 , due to the transformation from its original colour to the yellowy - green hue it has today			1
the photograph reveals a stark contrast to the fiery colours now exhibited at the tourist attraction the popular tourist attraction sees three million visitors flock to gaze at its psychedelic waters in @entity38 , @entity39			0
the site first gained popularity in the 1940s when a million tourists would visit the site pool on fire ! the fierce colours are influenced by how light interacts with the water ’s depth , with yellow and orange colours in the shallows and green in the deep waters the rainbow hot spring has been clogged up with debris , which block the heat vents , and affecting the water circulation in the pool it is estimated that the destruction of the hot spring has been building up for decades			1
research by @entity64 and @entity65 in @entity66 helped to create a model that could depict the hot spring 's colours from over a century ago , when it was less frequented by visitors			0
now nearly three million tourists flock to @entity5 , compared to the one million in the 1940s , which has led to the build - up of debris in the pool			2
as the underwater vents started to get clogged up , water circulation was affected , decreasing the temperature of the waters and causing a migration of the orange - coloured bacteria towards the centre			1
@entity83 from science friday said : ' pigments produced by swaths of those microbes — called microbial mats — are responsible , at least in part , for the brilliant yellows , greens , and oranges that now tinge @entity10 and other thermal pools in @entity5			0
' photographs from 1966 show the @entity97 pool 's original blue colour , before the build up of coins and rubbish the pool received its name in 1883 from @entity103 , who was the wife of assistant park superintendent , @entity104			2
as a nod to its then crystal blue colour , she named it after the blue flower , @entity10			0
although it was originally known by its latin name , @entity111 , by 1889 it was commonly known by its current name			0
over three million people enjoy the @entity5 annually , spans an area of 3,468.4 square miles , comprising lakes , canyons , rivers and mountain ranges unless some subterranean shift happens where more hot water can again flow to the surface , morning glory will never be fully blue again half of the world 's geothermal features are in @entity5 , fueled by @entity127 , the largest supervolcano on the continent the pool has warning signs around it , in an attempt to reduce further vandalism to its waters , ( left )			1
it has been dubbed @entity19 , now bearing little resemblance to the bright blue flowers which gave it its name , ( right )			0

morning glory in @entity5 has *drastically* changed from crystal blue to a yellowy - green hue
debris has blocked underwater vents , causing a rise in the spring temperature
over three million people visit the park , and due to the rubbish and coins , it is now nicknamed *fading* glory
