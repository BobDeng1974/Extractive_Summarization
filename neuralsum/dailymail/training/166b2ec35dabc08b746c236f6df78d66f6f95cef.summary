@entity1 's wife - who is not named in the video - was covered in pus this is the stomach churning moment a loving wife goes above and beyond the call of duty - and gets hit with flying pus from her husband 's 32 - year - old cyst			1
@entity11 's poor wife - who is not named in the video - is on hand to help out as he squeezes the pus - filled cyst			1
but what neither of them were expecting was the force with which 32 years of pressure would release from mr @entity1 's leg			1
after a few squeezes producing not much , mr @entity1 encourages his wife , who is holding the camera , to ' get up close on it '			1
less than a second later , a stream of flying pus rockets from his leg - hitting his phone , and his screaming wife			2
worse , after the first stream of putrid liquid , mr @entity1 continues to squeeze , so it can only be assumed his very patient wife continued to be covered in the yellow pus			1
but he does n't seem to worried			0
' wow , oh my @entity33 , ' he is heard saying			0
i do n't even know what to say right now			0
' initially , his wife - dressed in an appropriate ' beginners luck ' t - shirt - seems more worried about his phone , before taking a closer look at her arms			0
' @entity33 , this is horrible , " mr @entity1 finally concedes , before adding : ' it 's not done either			1
' what is this thing ? ' but , despite his disgust , he is n't to be put off from filming the aftermath - asking his wife to go and get the camera			0
when his wife returns , he finally reveals the true carnage : a covering of lumpy pus on the phone the couple were filming with			2
and finally , he manages to apologise to his wife , who is seen mopping the floor with a tissue			2
' sorry babe , ' mr @entity1 says			1
but remorse does n't seem to last long			0
' this is the greatest day of my life , ' he says			1
this is the latest in a line of ' spot ' videos which have both disgusted and enthralled the internet in recent months			0
@entity76 - a pseudonym - possibly produced the most revolting video of the year , when he filmed the squeezing of a spot on his neck like mr @entity1 , he also roped his poor wife in to help			1
mr @entity76 told @entity84 he decided to get squeezing after noticing whiteheads appearing , and the spot starting to hurt			2
and despite it looking quite horrendous , it did n't hurt at all			0
‘ ' it just felt like pressure releasing , ' he said			0
‘ once a significant amount of stuff had come out , it felt way better , and soon stopped hurting altogether			0

*warning* : @entity94
@entity11 had a cyst on his leg for 32 years
when he finally decided to squeeze it , a *jet* of pus hit his squealing wife
mr @entity1 describes it as ' the greatest day of my life '
