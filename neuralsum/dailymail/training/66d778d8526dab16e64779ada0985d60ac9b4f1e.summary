most women change their hairstyle following an emotional break - up , but one woman went about changing her appearance in a much more dramatic way			1
when feisty @entity6 hit a mid-life - crisis she decided to cover her body in tattoos - but now she ca n’t get a man because her appearance scares them off			1
the mother - of - two ’s ink obsession started at 37 after she separated from her husband and her children flew the nest			1
after she divorced from her husband , she covered 80 per cent of her body in ink since then she ’s dramatically changed her ‘ mumsy ’ look - adding a new design to her skin almost every week			1
now 80 per cent of her body is covered - including her face			2
the 49 - year - old , from the sleepy town of @entity28 in @entity29 , says she has no regrets - but not everyone loves her tattoos as much as she does			1
known as ‘ the freak of @entity28 ’ , she has n’t been in a relationship for the past seven years			1
regrets : although she originally inked herself to make herself feel less ' mumsy ' , she is now regretting the decision because she ca n't get a man because her appearance scares them off she said : ' i love my tattoos but men do n’t seem to feel the same			2
my appearance seems to scare them off			2
' i ’ve only ever been on one date in seven years			2
that was through a tattoo - lovers dating site - but it did n’t last			2
' i think when men first look at me , they think i ’m a bit rough			2
they mutter ‘ look at the state of her ’ under their breath			1
they do n’t bother to get to know me			2
' @entity6 is proud of her tattoos and never covers them up - apart from when she visits her 80 - year - old mother			1
where it all began : @entity6 , who suffers from osteoporosis and is currently unemployed , got her first tattoo done when she was 18 ( pictured , @entity65 , age 28 , and @entity67 , age 19 ) taunted : she is known around her hometown as ' the freak of @entity28 ' so she got ' @entity71 ' scribed on her palm to fend off negative comments proud : despite the negativity , she is proud of her looks and only covers her tattoos up when she pays a visit to her 80 - year - old grandmother she said : ' the only place i have n’t got tattooed is my bum and that ’s because i do n’t see the point - afterall , who ’s going to see it ? ' but my mum hates my tattoos , so whenever she comes round i wear a jumper and scarf			1
it makes me feel a bit like a teenager but i prefer to avoid rowing			2
but besides her , i wo n’t cover up for anyone			2
' when @entity6 ’s marriage came to an end after 10 years , she moved to the small market town of @entity28 to live near her parents			1
she said : ' i started working in a newsagents where i met a local tattoo artist			2
she specialised in designs of pin up girls , and one day i thought - " i want one of them "			2
' my dress and hair had always been quite normal before , but i felt like a change			2
i ’d always been a bit mumsy - wearing baggy jumpers , leggings and no makeup			2
time for a change : when @entity6 's marriage came to an end after 10 years , she moved to the small market town of @entity28 to live near her parents and underwent a style makeover addiction : she became addicted to getting tattoos , especially after becoming close friends with the artist and getting them for free ( pictured here with tattoo artist @entity119 at a @entity120 in @entity29 ) ' but i wanted to add a bit of glamour into my life			1
i had @entity124 done , then @entity125			0
' i loved the way they looked so feminine			0
after all , i like to make an effort			0
there ’s no way i ’d go out of the house without any makeup on			0
' @entity6 admits that tattooing became an addiction after the tattoo artist became a close friend and offered to ink her for free			1
she said : ' once i started , i could n’t stop - it became an addiction			0
' three years ago , @entity6 decided to start dating again			1
she said : ' i did n’t think there was much chance of meeting the man of my dreams in @entity28 , so i went on nights out in @entity146 to @entity147			1
what a difference : @entity6 thinks she had always been a bit mumsy - wearing baggy jumpers , leggings and no makeup ( pictured , @entity65 , 25 and , @entity67 , 38 ) ' i felt more at home there , and people would come up to me and tell me how amazing my tattoos were			1
but often , that ’s as far as the conversation went			0
' so @entity6 decided to sign up to a dating website for tattoo lovers			1
she said : ' i knew i would n’t have much luck with normal men because i do n’t think they like to be seen with a tattooed woman , so i decided to try and hit it off with people like me			1
but i only went on one date , and the guy only had one tattoo			0
i was n’t very impressed			0
' over the years @entity6 has become so disheartened that she is ready to give up on the dating game			1
she said : ' i do n’t think there ’s much chance of me being in a relationship now			0
' but i do n’t regret getting them done			0
i think people should be able to see past the tattoos and accept who the person is on the inside and not on the outside			0
' out and about : she says people would come up to her and tell her how amazing her tattoos were			0
but often , that 's as far as the conversation went @entity6 , who suffers from osteoporosis and is currently unemployed , got her first tattoo done when she was 18			1
but it was n’t until her marriage ended in divorce and her two sons , aged 24 and 21 , left home , that her obsession snowballed			1
she said : ' i had a bit of a midlife crisis			1
i got to 44 and realised that my marriage was in tatters			1
i was also unemployed because i ’d developed osteoporosis in my back			0
i felt old and rejected			0
' but then i started getting more tattoos done and every time i got inked , i felt a new lease of life			0
now people look at me and they ca n’t believe i ’m nearly 50			0
' she added : ' i get a lot of negative responses			0
they call me ‘ the freak of @entity28 ’			1
but at the end of the day it ’s just small - town mentality			0
' covered : the only part of her body where she does n't have a tattoo is on her bottom because she ' does n't see the point ' the abuse got so bad that @entity6 even had ‘ talk to the hand ’ tattooed on her palm , now she shows it whenever she gets a negative comment			1
she added : ' i did worry what people would think , but then i thought , so what , it ’s my body , not theirs			0
mum would n’t speak to me for days afterwards though , and dad ’s just given up on me			0
' sometimes i do worry that my tattoos will affect my ability to get a job in the future , because i do think employers judge you on your appearance			0
but i do n’t have any regrets - it ’s all worth it			0
' now her eldest son @entity242 , 24 , who is a cobbler , is following in his mum ’s footsteps - he has had 40 tattoos done			0
meanwhile her youngest son @entity248 , 21 , who is a hairdresser , has just experimented with a tiny star			0
@entity6 said : ' it does n’t bother me that my boys have had tattoos done - that ’s up to him			1
as long as they do n’t offend anyone			0
' sometimes i worry that he ’s getting the same abuse that i do , but then i remind myself that he can look after himself			1
i ’m just glad that he ’s brave enough to be individual , just like his mum			0
