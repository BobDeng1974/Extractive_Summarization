by @entity0 published : 17:33 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 01:48 est , 10 october 2012 @entity1 will today claim the values he learned from his disabled father can save @entity4 in its ‘ hour of reckoning ’			1
the prime minister will warn the country is in a global race and must sink or swim in its efforts to deal with the economic crisis			1
in an unusually personal speech to the @entity14 conference , he will say ‘ hard work , strong values , taking responsibility and serving others ’ – qualities he learned from his late father , @entity20 – are needed to ensure @entity4 remains ‘ the greatest country on earth ’			1
birthday night out : today the prime minister will warn the country is in a global race but last night he celebrated his 46th birthday in @entity28 dining out : the couple arrive at the the @entity31 restaurant in the city to celebrate despite a series of crowd - pleasing announcements that have cheered the @entity14 faithful , mr @entity1 will insist the party remains on the political ‘ common ground ’			1
he will say his mission is to show that conservatives are ‘ for everyone : @entity41 or @entity42 , black or white , straight or gay ’			1
the prime minister celebrated his 46th birthday at the conference last night with his wife @entity47 , who travelled up from @entity48 to take him out for a curry			1
he had earlier told @entity50 : ‘ i ’m looking forward to @entity47 coming back to @entity28 and i ’m hoping she ’s going to take me out for a balti			2
’ perhaps keen to seize the opportunity for some good publicity , one of mr @entity1 ’s aides tipped off a news agency photographer about where the couple would be dining			2
mr @entity1 had earlier posted a picture on @entity59 , above , of him laughing with foreign secretary @entity60 after being presented with a birthday cake in the shape of a caterpillar			2
traditional @entity14 values , he will argue , are compassionate because they are good not just for the strong and successful in society but also the poor , the weak and the vulnerable			1
‘ conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy , but the way we build a big society , ’ he will say			1
the prime minister will offer a tacit acknowledgement that many voters are still unsure what he stands for after seven years as party leader , saying : ‘ there is nothing complicated about me			1
‘ i believe in working hard , caring for my family and serving my country			1
and there is nothing complicated about what we need today			2
this is still the greatest country on earth			1
we showed that again this summer			2
smiles all round : @entity1 and his wife leave the @entity31 restaurant reunited : he had earlier told @entity50 : ' i 'm looking forward to @entity47 coming back to @entity28 and i 'm hoping she 's going to take me out for a balti ' ‘ but it ’s tough			2
these are difficult times , we ’re being tested			2
how will we come through it ? again , it ’s not complicated			2
hard work , strong families , taking responsibility , serving others			1
’ the road to recovery following the financial crisis , the prime minister will admit , is proving longer and harder than anyone anticipated			1
but aides said he believed many people had failed to realise the scale of the threat facing @entity4 and other debt - laden @entity110 economies			0
‘ unless we act , unless we take difficult , painful decisions , unless we show determination and imagination , @entity4 may not be in the future what it has been in the past , ’ he will tell his @entity28 audience			0
close to the heart : @entity1 with son @entity119 in 2004			0
he will use his own family ¿ s story as he seeks to explain what makes him tick - speaking frankly of his late son , @entity119 , and his father @entity20 , who died in 2010 ‘ because the truth is this			0
we ’re in a global race today , and that means an hour of reckoning for countries like ours			1
’ his father @entity20 , who died in 2010			0
in his speech he will say : ¿ my dad influenced me much more than i ever thought ' the prime minister will dismiss calls for a ‘ @entity138 ’ on the economy , ridiculing @entity140 for wanting to borrow yet more money in a ‘ massive gamble with our economy and our future ’			1
but he will use his own family ’s story as he seeks to explain what makes him tick – revealing that his grandfather abandoned his grandmother , and speaking frankly of his late son , @entity119 , and his father @entity20 , who died in 2010			0
‘ my dad influenced me much more than i ever thought			0
he was born with no heels on his feet and legs about a foot shorter than they ’re meant to be			0
but he never complained – even when he lost both those legs later in life			0
‘ because disability in the 1930s was such a stigma , he was an only child			0
but @entity163 was the eternal optimist			0
to him the glass was always half full , usually with something alcoholic in it			0
‘ when i was a boy ... i asked him what he was most proud of			0
it was simple – working hard from the moment he left school and providing a good start in life for his family			1
not just all of us , but helping his mum too , when his father ran off			0
‘ not a hard luck story , but a hard work story			1
family comes first , but put back in to the community too			0
’ meanwhile , mr @entity1 is set to push through gay marriage laws as early as next year despite backbench dissent			0
he has told ministers the reform is a ‘ straightforward matter of equality ’ and should happen as soon as possible			0
mps have been promised a free vote on the plans .			0

the prime minister will warn the country is in a global race and must sink or swim in its efforts to deal with the economic crisis
