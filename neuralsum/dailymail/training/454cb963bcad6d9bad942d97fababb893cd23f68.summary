by @entity0 an attorney for a teenager who pleaded guilty to killing three students in a high school cafeteria has asked an appeals court to toss out his sentence of life without parole because he was 17 at the time of the shooting			1
a prosecutor told the judges on wednesday that @entity14 law makes it clear that older teens charged with serious crimes should be tried in adult court			2
@entity21 's attorney is challenging a state law that allowed his case to be transferred from juvenile court to adult court , a statute also being contested in an unrelated case pending before the @entity27 involving a 16 - year - old sent to prison			1
unrepentant : @entity21 , pictured at his original hearing in march 2013 , was 17 when he shot and killed three students in an @entity14 high school cafeteria and now his lawyers are arguing that he should have an appeal shocking : @entity37 made and obscene gesture to the families of the victims in court last year and wore a t - shirt that read ' killer ' across his chest the law requires the transfer to adult court if a suspect is 16 or 17 and accused of one of the most severe offenses , and there is probable cause to believe he or she committed the crime			1
@entity37 was waiting for a bus to his alternative school in february 2012 when he opened fire at @entity58 , east of @entity59			1
three students died and three others were wounded			0
the original hearing took place inside a courtroom where a smirking @entity37 wore a t - shirt with ' killer ' scrawled across it and gestured obscenely toward the victims ' families during his sentencing			1
he was n't present wednesday			0
@entity37 , 19 , could be brought back to the same courtroom if the courts decide he should be resentenced			0
it could take several months for the appeals court to decide			0
because @entity37 was a juvenile , he is ineligible for the death penalty			0
grieving community : the february 2012 shooting rampage at @entity58 left three boys dead and three other students injured @entity37 's attorney , @entity77 , argued that juvenile judges have more leeway with younger teens			1
' what is the difference between a 15 - year - old and a 17 - year - old ? he is still not an adult , ' @entity77 said			1
@entity87 prosecutor @entity86 countered that several rulings have upheld the state law allowing juveniles to be sent to adult court			2
he said the law is intended so that a 17 - year - old ca n't shoot someone in the head and be set free when he turns 21			1
the @entity96 is aware of four people in @entity14 , including @entity37 , serving life without parole for slayings that occurred when they were juveniles , assistant public defender @entity102 said			0
as of 2012 , there were about 2,500 people in the @entity105 serving life sentences for homicides that occurred when they were juveniles , but the current number is difficult to track because a @entity105 @entity27 ruling that year raised the possibility that hundreds of those sentences may be called into question , said @entity113 , chief counsel for the @entity115 - based nonprofit @entity114			2
pure rage : @entity117 , mother of victim @entity118 , called @entity37 a monster and told him that he does n't deserve to be called human tears of grief : @entity123 , sister of slain student @entity125 , addressed the court at @entity37 's sentencing in mourning : @entity129 , brother of @entity130 , reads a statement on behalf of his mother giving juveniles life terms without parole ' means that we 're making these decisions on @entity138 of sentencing about who @entity37 or any other juvenile will be 30 , 40 , 50 years from now , ' @entity113 said			2
' and it 's almost impossible to make that decision or to know who he will become as an adult			0
' @entity37 's attorney also argued wednesday that he should be resentenced after a recent @entity27 decision overturned a life - without - parole sentence for @entity149 , who along with two adult defendants was convicted in two slayings in the @entity153 area when @entity149 was 17			1
the high court ruled that youth must be considered as a mitigating factor and the record must reflect that the court did so			0
the ruling said a trial court must reconsider @entity149 's sentence , though it does n't block him from being sentenced again to life without parole			2
@entity77 argued that the judge who sentenced @entity37 never formally brought up his age			0
the prosecutor disagreed , saying age was not ignored during the process .			0

@entity21 was tried as an adult when he shot and killed three students in february 2012 even though he was 17 - years - old
*infamously* took his button down shirt off in court to *reveal* a t - shirt with the word ' killer ' scrawled across his chest
he was sentenced to life in jail without parole and now his legal team is trying to have the case appealed so that he is tried as a child instead
was not in court on wednesday when his lawyers argued for the appeal
