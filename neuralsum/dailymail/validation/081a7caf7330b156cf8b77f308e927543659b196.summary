source : @entity94 ' i 've been on nights out before and collapsed from laughing when i 'm having a good time and people will rush over thinking i 'm paralytic and need help			2
' it 's really difficult not to laugh sometimes and i 've had to learn to try and control my emotions			1
' miss @entity4 can have over 10 episodes a day , but over time she has learnt to control her fall			1
she said : ' i used to worry that one time i 'd fall and really hurt myself , but now i can sense when it 's going to happen			1
' the first time i noticed symptoms was when i 'd gone to see @entity27 and the @entity28			2

' i felt a strange sensation in me neck , it became so weak it just flopped forward and i struggled to support it			0

' i try to stay positive but sometimes both conditions can get me down			0
' thankfully i have incredible friends and family who have all been fantastic			0
' they 've really helped me cope and i feel safer when i 'm out with someone who actually understands and can help if i start to collapse or if i need to sleep			2

@entity4 has the condition cataplexy - a sudden loss of muscle control
it causes her to collapse when she experiences strong emotions , *including* anger and laughter - meaning she avoids sad films and comedy shows
has learnt to control her falls so she does n't hurt *hurself* when collapsing
also has narcolepsy which means she needs to sleep for hours at a time
