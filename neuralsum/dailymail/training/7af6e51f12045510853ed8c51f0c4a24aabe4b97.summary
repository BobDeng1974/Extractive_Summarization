by @entity0 published : 09:10 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 09:21 est , 25 september 2012 revealing study : the @entity3 team say that ' less - attractive ' people are often less conscious of their bodies than ' good - looking ' people for better or for worse , society has ' ideals ' in terms of what an an attractive body is			1
ask people to define a physically good - looking person , and most will list being ' thin ' and ' in - shape ' as characteristics , and perhaps they will offer up @entity16 or the @entity17 as good archetypes			1
but a surprising study from @entity3 suggests that those who are furthest away from these ' ideals ' are just as satisfied with their appearance			1
in fact , the study found those with ' good looking ' bodies were more likely to be self - conscious about their appearance			2
the study , at the @entity29 , saw researchers @entity30 and @entity32 hold in - depth interviews with 20 @entity3 men and women			1
according to @entity38 , half of the group was categorised as ' bodily deviant ' - either struggling with obesity for years , suffering burn damage , or with physical handicaps			0
the ' bodily deviant informants ' were asked to describe an attractive or sexy body and - while acknowledging the slim and fit ideal - stressed that personality as well as charm and charisma were the most important and attractive features			2
pulling out examples from the study , the team point to one obese woman who found men ' who cared for others to be sexy and that ' a good - looking body may just as well be chubby as thin , really			1
to me it does n’t matter			0
' the ' most obese informant ' meanwhile said ' a sexy body has a lot to do with the personality that shines through '			0
@entity30 suggested the overweight participants would downplay the importance of appearance ' to legitimise and normalise their own oversized and untrained bodies ' and ' feel better about themselves '			0
reflections of beauty : the @entity17 is believed to depict @entity68 , the @entity69 goddess of love and beauty @entity30 added : ' some of those whose bodies were obviously too large said they were pretty satisfied			0
one participant , a 30 - year - old known as @entity76 , had severe skin damage due to a fire injury			0
but he told the researchers that was accustomed to his scars - and instead noticed other things about his body that he would like to change			1
he said : ' one has to accept what it is impossible to do anything about , otherwise things get too difficult			2
' ' one obese woman had learned to completely ignore her own body and led a life with good confidence and a good job			2
' the team conclude that those outside ' the norm ' will accept their body features as they are difficult or impossible to change			1
meanwhile those in the study with average and good - looking bodies seemed less satisfied than those with deviant bodies			1
@entity30 told @entity38 : ' it was surprising to us that those who were rather fit and slim were dissatisfied with their looks			0
' i think people are affected by pictures that are displayed in media , advertisements and public space without really knowing it			0
' our ideas of the perfect body is shaped by what we 're exposed to , and we 're exposed to it no matter if we like it or not			0
' but this reflects the society we live in – you ca n't be too good - looking			2

study from @entity3 suggests ' good - looking ' people notice their body *imperfections* more than larger or handicapped people
researchers believe those outside ' the norm ' accept their body features as they are difficult or impossible to change
