over the years i ’ve been lucky enough to play with a lot of accomplished women golfers , including two former world no 1 's in @entity4 and @entity5			1
but none of these encounters prepared me for playing 18 holes with @entity9 , the best teenage golfer in @entity10			1
suffice to say : i knew she was good but i did n’t appreciate she was so damn good			0
the venue was @entity13 and a media day for the @entity15 in july			0
the sun was shining , @entity17 was shimmering in the distance and @entity19 put on a shot - making clinic			1
@entity9 can make it to the very top of the women 's game if she carries on her progression teenager @entity19 possesses the same ‘ wow ’ factor as world no 1 @entity30 ( below ) one of the nice things for me about playing golf with the women pros is we usually hit the ball about the same length			1
@entity19 hit drives that pitched past mine			1
she positively exudes the ‘ wow ’ factor @entity30 had at the same age			1
like @entity30 , she ’s also easy company			1
normally the way these things work is for the journalist to kick start conversations but @entity19 asked more questions than i did			2
she wanted to know everything about the course , from the historic role of the celebrated lighthouse to the war memorial that offers sober reflection to golfers on the back nine			0
the 19 - year - old was keen to know about the revamp planned by the @entity60 family , who recently purchased @entity13 , under the guidance of course architect @entity62			1
again , like @entity30 , there ’s the requisite amount of steel			2
‘ i ’d hit a five iron off this tee to stay short of the bunkers , ’ advised her caddy @entity66 , on the opening hole			0
‘ no , i want to hit a driver , ’ replied @entity9			2
indeed , she hit a driver off every tee , which is the way she likes to do things in practice			0
‘ i just find taking on the holes makes me concentrate , ’ she explained			0
again , like @entity30 , the driver also happens to be the best club in her bag			2
the 19 - year - old has the same mentality and ' wow factor ' as world no 1 @entity30 it puts her in the vanguard of the next revolution set to sweep the women ’s game			1
after the emergence of the @entity94 and the revival of the @entity96 , get set for the power hitters to leave their mark in the same way their male counterparts hold sway in the men ’s version			2
@entity19 is part of a group that includes @entity107 rookie @entity106 and @entity96 @entity108			1
@entity19 has added 25 yards to her drive since hooking up with swing coach @entity111 earlier this year			1
again , like @entity30 — there could be a theme here — her swing is so good she uses blade irons ( she might be the only woman to do so ) , which are the preserve of the technically sound			2
@entity96 @entity108 is another highly - touted golfer in women 's golf and will challenge @entity19 what ’s next for the girl from @entity121 who plays at @entity122 and who finished no 1 in @entity124 last year , the youngest to do so ? she has now earned her privileges to play in @entity96 and clearly that is the next proving ground			1
her plan is to be the best player in the world at 21 — the year @entity30 reached the summit — which might be a tall order given the present incumbent happens to be 13 months younger and won yet again in @entity96 on sunday			1
@entity19 speaks in respectful tones about @entity133			2
they played together in @entity135 recently , where the home favourite shot a course - record 61 to @entity19 ’s 64			1
‘ it was just an amazing day , and i hope we have many more , ’ said @entity9			0
@entity19 has ambitions to be the best in the world and she has a good chance of doing just that the great advantage she will have over @entity146 going forward is the fact she hits the ball significantly further			0
but will she hole enough putts to make it count ? on this day , she holed nothing of any length and still breezed round the @entity153 in 68 strokes			0
@entity19 recalled the last time she played @entity13 , in the @entity156			0
she was nine at the time , and stood 4ft 7in tall			0
‘ this was where i got knocked over by the wind , ’ she said , standing on the 11th tee			0
how typical that she got back up to win the event			0
a decade on , she ’ll take some knocking over this july … and beyond .			0

@entity10 golfer @entity9 has all the *attributes* to be one of the best
the 19 - year - old has the same ' wow factor ' as @entity30 at the same age
@entity19 is part of an *exciting* group including @entity107 's @entity106 and @entity96 @entity108
