' the ' polite no ' did not come from @entity4 , he said			2

@entity4 , once considered a possible running mate for @entity70 presidential candidate @entity69 , calmly and confidently testified in his own defense , saying the couple did nothing illegal and extended courtesies to @entity20 like any other elected official would			2
@entity4 and wife and wife @entity6 ( right ) can face decades in prison if convicted father and son : @entity4 leaves his trial with his son @entity81 ( right ) @entity12 challenged the former governor 's credibility , questioning @entity4 's assertion that he knew nothing about the first gifts @entity20 showered on the couple : an april 2011 shopping spree in @entity89 in which he spent nearly $ 20,000 on designer dresses and accessories for @entity92 to wear at her daughter 's wedding			1
@entity4 denied knowing @entity20 had paid for such expensive dresses			2
the former governor was n't on the shopping spree , but did sit next to @entity20 later that day at an event			0
' folks , how do you miss that ? ' @entity12 said to the jury			1

' @entity20 , the prosecution 's star witness , testified under immunity that he spent lavishly on the @entity11 only to secure their support for @entity23			1
