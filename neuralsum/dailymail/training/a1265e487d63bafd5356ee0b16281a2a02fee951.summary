by @entity0 published : 17:47 est , 18 august 2013 updated : 05:49 est , 19 august 2013 one of @entity2 ’s closest allies attempted to defend him yesterday after fresh attacks – but blundered by echoing an infamous sound bite used by ousted @entity6 leader @entity5			1
@entity8 business secretary @entity7 accused mr @entity2 ’s @entity10 critics of ‘ hysteria ’ as @entity12 led a chorus of disapproval about his performance this summer			1
responding to @entity12 ’s criticisms , mr @entity7 said : ‘ we are talking loud and of course we will be turning up the volume even louder			1
’ unfortunate words : @entity8 business secretary @entity7 said @entity10 would be ' turning up the volume ' mr @entity5 tried to answer his critics at the 2003 @entity6 conference by declaring : ‘ the quiet man is here to stay and he is turning up the volume			1
’ he was ousted 20 days later			0
in a further blow to mr @entity2 , two polls yesterday found that fewer than half of @entity10 supporters think he is doing a good job			1
@entity31 found that 46 per cent of @entity10 supporters and just 22 per cent of voters as a whole believe he is a good @entity35			1
the @entity37 survey found that 49 per cent of @entity10 supporters approve of his performance , but 43 think he is ‘ doing badly ’			2
by contrast , 92 per cent of @entity41 think @entity43 is doing well			0
but it is criticism from within his own party that mr @entity2 will find most wounding			2
bad times : two polls yesterday found that fewer than half of @entity10 supporters think @entity2 is doing a good job his former guru @entity52 – whom mr @entity2 ennobled – said that he needs to ‘ grow up ’ and start acting like a future prime minister			1
the peer said @entity10 was missing ‘ open goals ’ to hurt the government			2
he said : ‘ when @entity10 should be showing the way ahead , it gives the impression of not knowing which way to turn			2
‘ when the @entity10 battle bus should be revving up , it is parked in the lay - by of introspection			2
it is time for @entity2 to show he is a grown - up politician big enough to lead this country			2
’ cursed saying : work and @entity66 secretary @entity5 uttered similar words shortly before he was ousted as @entity6 leader mr @entity2 has been on the back foot for several weeks after he and his senior shadow cabinet colleagues took time off while @entity43 and his top team toured the tv studios promoting policies			1
lord @entity12 wrote yesterday : ‘ this summer , we massively failed to get our case over to the public and hold the @entity41 to account			0
‘ if shadow cabinet members are n’t pulling their weight , then give them the hairdryer treatment and kick them out			0
‘ time is running out			0
we can still turn it around and win in the second half			0
but we need the very best team , week in , week out			0
’ mr @entity7 said he backed mr @entity2 ‘ 1,000 per cent ’ to be leader at the next election , and dismissed the sniping			1
he said : ‘ there has been somewhat of a hysteria around over the august weeks			0
' we have got a lot more work to do over the next 90 - odd weeks that there are before the next general election to put our case to the @entity95 people , but that is precisely what we have been doing over the summer			0
’ nsixteen - year - olds will be able to vote in general elections if @entity10 wins in 2015 , boosting the chances of a coalition with the @entity102			0
@entity8 justice secretary @entity103 , a close ally of @entity2 , revealed yesterday that @entity10 will fight the next election on a pledge to introduce the reform			1
the @entity102 are longstanding supporters of the plan to lower the voting age from 18 to 16 .			0
