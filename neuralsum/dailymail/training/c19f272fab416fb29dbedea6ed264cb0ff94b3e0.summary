@entity7 , 21 , became addicted to the gym and skipping meals after she began to feel that she was unable to control anything else in her life			1
while her exercise regime seemed healthy , ms @entity11 was losing weight rapidly because she was consuming far fewer calories than her body needed			2
@entity7 ( left ) , 21 , says that she owes her life to her gym for banning her when she became dangerously thin ( right )			1
in a year she dropped from weighing 8st 7lbs to weighing just 5st it was only once she was banned from her gym that she realised how painfully thin she had become			1
now , she is finally on the road to recovery - and has been able to start living like any other student at a healthy 8st 9lbs			2
ms @entity7 , from @entity21 , said : ‘ i was obsessed with being the best in everything i did whether it was in sports events or school , i had to be the most successful or i was n’t happy			2
‘ when i started puberty i could n’t deal with all the changes happening to my body that i could n’t control			0
‘ i had always competed in running and when younger talent started emerging and i was n’t the best anymore i could n’t handle it			0
‘ my weight was something i could control completely and so i started skipping meals and working out more knowing that if i kept control of this then i might regain control of everything else in my life			1
ms @entity7 , who now weighs a healthy 8st 9lbs , says that she started to skip meals and over-exercise when she began to feel that she was losing control of her life ms @entity7 ( pictured since her recovery ) said : ' my weight was something i could control so i started skipping meals and working out more knowing that if i kept control of this then i might regain control of everything else ' ‘ when i started at university i became even worse because there was no one there to realise what i was doing or to make sure i did n’t skip meals			1
’ ms @entity7 first began to obsess about her weight when , aged 15 , training started to become more of a chore than a hobby and she could feel herself losing grasp of the perfect life she had crafted for herself			1
despite being a slim size eight , she felt this was not the best she could be and started skipping meals and heading to the gym as much as she possibly could			1
ms @entity7 ( pictured when she was ill ) says that her weight loss increased when she started university as there was no one there to ensure that she was not skipping meals ms @entity7 ( pictured , left , when she was ill and , right , since she has recovered ) says that her health problems began when she struggled to cope with the fact that she was no longer the best runner in competitions she said : ‘ knowing that there were younger people coming into competing who were better than me was hard			1
‘ i wanted to regain control of something and so i started to cut meals out and added in more and more gym workouts			2
’ aged 18 , ms @entity7 was a healthy size eight and weighed about eight - and - a - half stone – healthy for her 5ft 6ins frame			1
but within a year , she had lost more than a third of her body weight , dropping to five stone			0
ms @entity7 ( pictured taking part in an athletics competition ) said : ' knowing that there were younger people coming into competing who were better than me was hard ' despite her friends and family mentioning their worries , she was determined to keep losing weight and keep control of that part of her life			2
ms @entity7 said : ‘ i had been ill for about two years when one day i was pulled into the office at the gym at university by one of the staff			1
‘ he sat me down and said that he was going to have to ban me from the gym as people had been commenting on how worried they were about my weight			0
ms @entity7 said : ' i had been ill for about two years when one day i was pulled into the office at the gym at university by one of the staff			1
he sat me down and said that he was going to have to ban me from the gym ' ‘ i was furious to know that people had been talking about me behind my back but shocked that they were worried enough to make a comment			0
‘ i walked away from the gym feeling so embarrassed that i knew something had to change then and there			0
‘ i trawled the internet for somewhere that could help me and came across the @entity123			0
‘ they tailor - made a less terrifying diet plan based on my current food and exercise regimes which gradually built up over time			0
’ ms @entity7 says that being banned from the gym came as a shock to her because she had not realised that she was so thin			1
as soon as this happened , she started to look for help ms @entity7 has now returned to full health and is able to enjoy university weighing a healthy 8st 9lbs			1
her mother said : ' i am so proud that she managed to battle the illness and come out of the other side ' ms @entity7 ’s mother , @entity139 , said : ‘ when @entity7 started becoming obsessed with her weight we knew that this was a battle that she had to face			2
‘ the more we tried to stop her from doing it the more we pushed her into doing it more			0
‘ we just had to hope that she got things under control herself			0
‘ watching her so poorly was awful but all i could do was support her and try to look after her as much as i could			0
‘ i ’m so happy she is better now though and back to her normal self			0
‘ i am so proud that she managed to battle the illness and come out of the other side a much better and happier person			0

@entity7 dropped from 8st 7lbs to 5st in a year by skipping meals
only realised how thin she was when gym staff told her was no longer allowed to use their *equipment* and that they were **concerned** about her
when this happened , she sought help and has now returned to a healthy weight
if you *'re* **concerned** you may have anorexia , or know someone who has , visit @entity172
