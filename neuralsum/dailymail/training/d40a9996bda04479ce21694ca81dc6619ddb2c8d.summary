he is well known for his holiday fashion faux pas			0
and as his latest family photographs show , @entity2 has once again managed to put his foot in it			2
posing in a battered pair of open - toed leather sandals , the prime minister showed that when it comes to dressing , there are some things he has yet to learn from his time in office			1
it not the first time that he has fallen foul of the footwear fashion police			0
during a similar photo call in @entity34 earlier this year he was mocked for sticking to the same clunky loafers he had been spotted in on previous holidays			2
it seemed the camel - coloured £ 20.99 @entity38 had become a staple of the prime ministerial holiday wardrobe			0
his fondness of his shirt - and - suit uniform has diminished little over the last four years			0
and the awkwardly posed photos of his array of short - sleeved blue shirts – not to mention unconvincing poses in local fish markets – have become par for the course			0
this is despite the ample practice mr @entity2 has managed to squeeze in during his time in office – a total of 15 breaks			1
the pm showed off a pair of brown sandals , which make a change from his usual choice of block work shoes with jeans over the years , his fashion faux pas have ranged from wearing his smart black work shoes sockless in the @entity66 heat to donning grubby running trainers and white socks for a walk around a @entity71 town			2
in his first year in power , and the year his fourth child @entity74 was born , mr @entity2 managed only one trip to @entity20			1
but he made up for it the following year with no fewer than five holidays as he took his family to @entity79 , @entity20 , @entity80 and celebrated mrs @entity82 ’s 40th birthday in @entity83 before spending a fortnight in a luxury 300 - year - old villa in the @entity88 countryside			1
on more than one occasion , he raised eyebrows at home by being seen going sockless in the same black work shoes paired with formal trousers and a crumpled blue shirt – despite the heat			0
@entity2 has enjoyed a holiday every three months since taking over as prime minister in 2010 2010 : @entity20 , @entity98 2011 : @entity83 , @entity71 2011 : @entity20 , @entity98 2011 : @entity80 , @entity71 2011 : @entity88 , @entity99 2011 : @entity20 , @entity98 2012 : @entity100 , @entity71 2012 : @entity20 , @entity98 2013 : @entity80 , @entity71 2013 : @entity101 , @entity102 2013 : @entity103 , @entity104 2013 : @entity20 , @entity98 2014 : @entity34 , @entity71 2014 : @entity105 , @entity102 2014 : @entity20 , @entity98 in 2012 , mr @entity2 ’s holiday plans were curtailed by the @entity107 , which dominated the summer			1
but he still managed a trip to @entity100 with the family ... and another trip to @entity20			0
on this holiday and in another unfortunate series of photos the prime minister was spotted on the beach changing out of his swimming trunks – and using a well - positioned @entity118 towel to protect his modesty			0
the next year saw another return to @entity20 , a stay in an £ 11,000 - a - week villa in @entity80 and holidays to the @entity102 algarve and to the island of @entity103 in @entity104			1
his latest trip to @entity19 , @entity20 , is the @entity128 ’s third holiday of the year so far			1
he has previously visited @entity34 and @entity105 in @entity102			2
in 2012 , mr @entity2 said he was a ‘ great believer ’ in politicians taking holidays			1
he added : ‘ if you do n’t think politicians ought to have holidays , i think you need to have a serious think			0
’ the family ’s spring break in @entity34 this year may have been particularly calming as they stayed in a rural yoga retreat			2
mrs @entity82 is understood to have fallen in love with the idyllic destination			0
