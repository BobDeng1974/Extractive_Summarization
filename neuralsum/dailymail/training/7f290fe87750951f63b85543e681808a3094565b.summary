the annual @entity8 @entity7 took place at @entity11 's @entity10 on thursday and the intense event involved ten contestants lining up in front of chief arbiter of the @entity16 , @entity17 , as he put them through two days of rigorous memory tests			0
tests include memorising as many decks of playing cards as possible , or recalling lists of thousands of binary digits			1
@entity25 has now revealed some of the memory tips and insider secrets revealing exactly how memory masters are able to remember thousands and thousands of binary digits , in order			0
one method memory masters use to remember sequences of playing cards , or rows of numbers , is to assign them with particular celebrities , actions or objects			1
for example , the @entity41 , left , could be assigned to princess @entity43 , right			0
stories are then made up using these people , actions or objects most playing cards memorised - 1,456 ( 28 decks ) , held by @entity50 number of binary digits remembered in 30 minutes - 4,140 , held by @entity50 number of binary digits memorised in five minutes - 1,016 , held by @entity53 the first step , @entity25 said , is to stop looking at the digits as numbers and start seeing them as everyday objects , because this makes them easier to recall			1
@entity25 told @entity61 that the most effective way to do this is to use playing cards in place of numbers , and then assign certain attributes to these cards			1
for example , the ace card is one , the rest of the cards go in sequence and then a picture card can be 10			2
in the case of having to remember binary digits , another picture card could be used as 11			0
one method is to convert the names of the cards into the initials of a famous person - the @entity77 converts to ' ah ' , which could be @entity83			2
the @entity84 would become @entity85 , or @entity86 , and so on			0
it 's also possible to take this method a step further and assign playing cards with celebrities , actions and objects			1
this makes it possible to pair cards together to form longer digits , and helps create stories that make it possible to remember the order of the digits			2
memory expert @entity17 assigns the @entity84 , left , with @entity102 , right , singing a song at a piano			1
he then creates stories such as princess @entity43 met @entity102 , which becomes @entity41 followed by @entity84 , or the number 10 followed by the number four in a sequence for example , @entity25 said he assigns princess @entity43 as the @entity41			1
the action is ' waving ' and the object is a rose			0
@entity102 singing a song at a piano is what @entity25 uses for the @entity84 , while the the @entity117 is @entity118 and a golf tee			1
a simpler method could be to use a person 's initials , such as @entity83 ( ah ) for the @entity77 , for example @entity25 then creates a story using these , for example , princess @entity43 saw @entity102 when they went to see @entity118 play golf			1
this technique has the double benefit of being able to remember sequences of playing cards , but the numbers on the cards can also be used to remember strings of random digits			1
this would be 10 , for the picture card of the @entity41 , four for the @entity84 and one for the @entity117			0
this sentence helps @entity25 remember the sequence of numbers 1041 , or alternatively , in the case of binary digits , 1011111 - where the number four is converted into four individual umber ones			0
to reduce the amount of names , for example , this could also become @entity118 played a piano to a woman holding a rose			0
this would be the @entity117 and the @entity41 followed by the @entity84 , also known as 1104 or 1101111			0
this method provides enough variables to remember thousands of digits and the current world record is 4,140 held by @entity50 .			2

method involves assigning people , actions and objects to playing cards
the four of *diamonds* , for example , could be @entity102 singing
stories are then created by *combining* these attributes
