lifelong @entity4 enthusiast @entity9 is selling off his colossal 007 collection - which includes secret agent themed toys , sweets , ladies tights , and even cans of tuna the tens of thousands of individual pieces , painstakingly gathered over four decades , have taken over his four - bedroomed house in @entity24 , @entity25 - much to the annoyance of his long - suffering wife @entity34 but now - much to the relief of his long suffering wife @entity34 - the unusual haul of goods will go under the hammer on friday , and is expected to bring more than £ 100,000			1
' she ’s never been a fan of it because it takes over the house , ' mr @entity9 said			2
' she likes watching the films , but that ’s as far as it goes			0
' many of the 600 lots , some containing several items , were originally children ’s playthings , and friday ’s sale is being handled by specialist toy auction house @entity55 , of @entity57 on @entity58			2
and although individual items seem modestly priced - a rare edition of @entity62 ’s vintage @entity61 estimated at about £ 400 - it is the sheer scale which makes the collection unique			2
@entity66 @entity65 said : ' this reflects one man ’s passion for collecting over about 40 years , and he has amassed everything he could related to @entity4			0
' it ’s unbelievable what some people will collect			0
' there are posters , autographs , costumes , toys , sweets , cinema tickets , movie premiere programmes , brochures , easter eggs , bubble bath and even a pair of branded 007 shoes and ladies tights			2
mr @entity9 is even selling a couple of cans of @entity91 tuna fish - bought because the label bears a competition promoting @entity94			1
the father - of - two said he became ' hooked ' on @entity4 at the age of eight			0
the bizarre haul contains posters , autographs , costumes , toys , sweets , cinema tickets , movie premiere programmes , brochures , easter eggs , bubble bath and even a pair of branded 007 shoes and ladies tights he still recalls the day in 1973 when his father took him to the cinema for a double bill of @entity115 and @entity116			1
' when i came out , i was hooked - the music , the action , it got my pulse racing , ' he said			0
later , when he left school , he said he blew his first meagre £ 25 pay packet on branded goods			0
but two years ago , the 51 - year - old was made redundant as a senior custodian with @entity126 , and he has been able to find only part time work since			1
mr @entity9 , who has met all six @entity4 stars several times and became a personal friend of ‘ q ’ actor @entity131 , said : ' there are a few reasons why i ’m selling - i ’m 51 , i ca n’t take it with me , and i ’ve got two kids and a mortgage to support			2
' i also i lost my job two years ago and i ’m only in part time work at the moment , that ’s how bad its been			0
' just before i was made redundant we bought a new house and i had an idea that i was gong to turn the fourth bedroom , which is like an annexe , into a private museum			1
' but that ’ll never happen now and i want to knock a hole in the mortgage			0
i ’ve got to enjoy my life rather than scrimping and saving and worrying			0
