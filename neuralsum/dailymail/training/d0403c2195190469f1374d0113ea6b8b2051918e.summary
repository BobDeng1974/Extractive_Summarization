tough stance : @entity1 , conservative mp for @entity2 , has said limiting access to free healthcare is key to preventing the @entity5 becoming an ' international health service ' migrants from @entity8 and @entity9 who travel to @entity11 without a job are to be told they must have private medical insurance to prevent the @entity5 becoming an ‘ international health service ’			1
immigration minister @entity1 told the @entity15 that limiting access to free healthcare is seen as key to preventing a fresh influx of migrants when controls are lifted at the end of this year			1
he suggested the requirement for medical insurance would apply to all student incomers and those who claim they are ‘ self - sufficient ’ , meaning they are not coming looking immediately for work			1
ministers are also examining incomers ’ rights to benefits and other public services			1
other measures under discussion include requiring migrants to leave @entity11 if they fail to secure a job after three months – or can not prove they have sufficient funds to support themselves for at least six months			2
transitional arrangements in place since 2005 , which restrict the rights of 29million @entity9 and @entity8 citizens to live and work in other @entity44 states , will expire on january 1			0
no official figure has been put on the anticipated number of arrivals , but @entity49 @entity48 warn there must be no repeat of the situation when @entity53 joined the @entity44 and @entity54 catastrophically underestimated the numbers that would come			0
a significant influx of immigrants from the two former @entity59 regimes could derail the @entity49 ’ testing target of reducing net immigration to under 100,000 by 2015			0
campaign group @entity62 has claimed as many as 250,000 people could arrive in the @entity11 from @entity8 and @entity9 over the next five years , though ministers do not believe there will necessarily be an influx of that size since other @entity44 countries are lifting restrictions at the same time			0
mr @entity1 , who is chairing a new @entity71 committee examining measures to deter incomers who would be a burden , said : ‘ we are all clear we need an immigration system that works in the national interest			1
that is why we are bringing together colleagues from other departments to address the pull factors that drive immigration to the @entity11			0
‘ @entity84 nationals do not have unrestricted access to the @entity11 – they must be exercising their treaty rights			0
this means they must be working , studying or self - sufficient			1
we already have tough rules on access to benefits ; we need to see if there is more we can do to tighten them up			0
‘ in addition , @entity44 students and those that are self - sufficient should not be a burden on the host member state , which means they should have things like health insurance			1
we have a @entity5 , not an international health service			1
’ it is unclear how the proposals would work in practice but it is likely @entity5 staff would be asked to check healthcare entitlements when migrants first came into contact with the @entity5			2
immigration : transitional arrangements in place since 2005 , which restrict the rights of 29million @entity9 and @entity8 citizens to live and work in other @entity44 states , will expire on january 1 but restrictions on access to free healthcare are likely to run into opposition from some doctors , who resent the idea they should act as another branch of the immigration service			2
ministers insist @entity11 must have the right to address ‘ pull factors ’ that are blamed for attracting jobless migrants from the @entity44			2
areas being looked at include healthcare , education , housing and benefits			0
the @entity5 has written off debts of at least £ 35million incurred by foreign national patients since 2002			2
as well as restrictions on students and non-working migrants from the @entity44 , ministers are understood to be considering making @entity139 migrants have health insurance before being granted a visa			1
@entity142 said the government was determined to prevent potential damage to the labour market from a fresh influx of migrants , but acknowledged @entity11 will have to operate within @entity44 rules on the right to free movement			0
the government is also examining the idea of an ad campaign telling potential migrants in @entity8 and @entity9 that @entity11 streets are not necessarily ‘ paved with gold ’ .			0

migrants need health insurance to stop @entity5 becoming ' international ' service
mp @entity1 said requirement would be for self - sufficient and students
