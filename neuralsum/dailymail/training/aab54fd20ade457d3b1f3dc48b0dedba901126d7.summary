by @entity0 published : 14:02 est , 5 december 2013 @entity2 : 14:11 est , 5 december 2013 news of @entity4 , the @entity5 woman whose baby delivered by caesarean section without her consent and then removed from her by @entity10 social services has shocked the nation over the past week			1
ms @entity4 was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in the @entity13 while here for a training course			1
her lawyers have launched a legal action in a bid to try to get her daughter back and have said the mother - of - three suffers from a relatively minor mental illness , a bipolar condition that can be treated with medication			1
someone who sympathises all too well with the unimaginable pain of having your child taken from you is @entity28 , who last year had a similar experience			1
@entity28 had struggled with with depression after the death of her 10 - year - old @entity45 became so unwell that she admitted herself voluntarily to a psychiatric hospital , where , with excellent care , she recovered			1
‘ i was at my worst it was such a dark period for me			0
i admitted myself to hospital because i did n’t know what else i could do			2
' i found living without my son very hard so i did self - admit myself to the psychiatric ward			2
the treatment there was fantastic			0
it was the best thing i could have ever done			0
‘ when i left i knew my life had to change			0
i wanted help and i wanted to get better for my children ’s sake			0
i saw a mental health worker every week for a year , then every two weeks for a following year			2
it was mainly just for support , to make sure i did n’t slip and it just lifted me up and up and up			0
‘ i have never been as strong as i am now			0
i have no depression at all			0
’ at the end of december 2011 , having been trying for a second child , @entity28 was delighted to learn that she was pregnant			1
‘ i was so happy , ’ @entity28 says , ‘ it was obviously the best thing that had happened to us since our son had died so you ca n’t imagine the feeling that you can make a future again and to start living for the future and not the past anymore			1
’ however her joy at greeting her new arrival was curtailed when , in august 2011 , social workers enter her hospital room while she was in the middle of giving birth			1
@entity80 spoke out about her experience on this morning , saying that while she was reunited with @entity83 , other families may still be suffering an unfair separation ‘ they arrived very coldly , knocked on the door and walked straight in			2
’ clearly becoming emotional as she recalls the traumatic event @entity28 explains : ‘ they said to me “ @entity28 we ’re here because you ’re not very well and we are going to be placing your baby into foster care two hours after you give birth ” ‘ i thought it was a joke			1
i stood there with my mouth open			0
i could n’t believe it			0
' when she asked why @entity28 was told simply that she was ‘ not well ’ and that she had failed to attend a @entity97 ( cognitive behavioural therapy ) appointment the previous year			1
this was despite the fact that the @entity97 appointment had been booked by @entity28 herself in an effort to help her overcome a fear of spiders			2
having admitted her history of depression at her first antenatal appointment @entity28 saw a social worker just once when she was 6 months pregnant , and was told everything was fine			1
@entity36 suffered breathing difficulties when she was born and so was taken straight to @entity113 , from which she was taken by social services			1
@entity28 was not allowed to leave the ward during this time and did n't see her baby			1
having secured a lawyer from her hospital bed while in labour , @entity28 found herself in court fighting for the right to keep her own child just two days after giving birth			1
‘ i feel i had to do everything to get her back			2
at first they only asked for my medical records to prove i was n’t suffering with depression , then they wanted a psychiatrist ’s report			0
i knew that would be fine and then they said they wanted a psychologists report			2
‘ when that was fine they started to bring my disability into it			2
i was made to stand in front of them and wash a doll to prove i could do it			2
’ ultimately it took @entity28 over four months to get baby @entity36 back			1
@entity80 says when the social workers entered the hospital room when she was in labour she originally thought it was a joke ‘ i got her back after four months and even thought that was a very long time for me there are other families out there for who it has taken years			1
‘ it takes time and that is what ’s so hard			0
they set the court dates and you ca n’t bring them forward			0
‘ they were worried it would cause my depression again but if anything it gave me more fight ; i ’d lost one there was no way i was going to lose another			0
they set these timescales but what they do n’t realise is that when it ’s innocent people it ’s breaking the family apart			0
you ca n’t do it to the parents and you ca n’t do it to the children			0
the stress of the separation and fight to get @entity36 back caused the breakdown of @entity28 ’s marriage			1
despite the devastating effect of the incident on @entity28 and her family , she does acknowledge the difficult situation social workers are in			1
however she says : ‘ children ca n’t be put at risk , but innocent people ca n’t be put at risk			0
there are just too many mistakes happening			0

@entity28 , 37 , became depressed after her son died aged 10
she admitted herself to hospital and made a good recovery
two years later she became pregnant
she was told by a social worker during pregnancy that everything was fine
two social workers arrived when @entity28 was in labour and told her they were taking her daughter immediately after birth
ultimately it took @entity28 over four months to get baby @entity36 back
