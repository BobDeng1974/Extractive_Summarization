by @entity0 last updated at 2:32 pm on 28th june 2011 it appears @entity2 is using every platform she can to take a swipe at rival conservative daughter @entity5			1
not content with criticising her in her upcoming memoir not afraid of life : my @entity9 , when she accused her of complaining and felt she had to ' watch her back ' around her , the 20 - year - old criticised ms @entity5 again when she was interviewed for @entity18 's @entity17 news programme			0
when asked about her ' suspicions ' and ' problems ' with @entity5 , @entity2 replied : ' yeah i just want to note that we come from two very different worlds , i mean her dad 's a politician and my mom 's a politician , but that never defined me			2
scroll for video candid : @entity2 talks to @entity18 about her ' problems ' with @entity5 saying that they were very different people and that they do not speak family : @entity2 said that @entity5 let her father 's job define her and has never had a job ' we do n't talk , we are not friends , nothing like that but i just want to note that we are two very different people			1
' i 've had a job since i was really little and , um , i do n't know if she does stuff like that			0
' @entity2 's memoir has just been released and has already attracted a lot of controversy for her candid remarks surrounding her teenage pregnancy and ex-boyfriend @entity47 as well as her rivals on @entity49 and ms @entity5			2
she recalled one incident when they were in hair and make - up getting ready for a speech during the @entity5 campaign and the senator 's daughter stormed in , demanding to be done			1
@entity2 wrote : ' as @entity5 looked at us , you could tell she was supremely irritated			2
" i need to be worked on , " she barked			0
when she was told she had to wait because the others were getting ' more air time ' than she was , @entity2 claims she then screamed : ' if anyone had told me i had to do my own hair and make - up , i would 've done my own f * * * ing hair and make - up			1
' in a final dig at her rival , the @entity71 contestant then wrote : ' surely she was n't so self obsessed that she believed everyone else should scoot over so she could take priority			0
' frenemy : @entity2 slammed @entity5 in her memoir and said she was always complaining and ' checking them out ' speaking about @entity78 - who is the senator 's second wife and heir to a beer fortune - she referred to her as being ' like a @entity82 ' and said : ' i 'd never seen people with so much @entity86 luggage , so many cell phones , and so many constant helpers to do hair and makeup			1
' she said that @entity5 wore thousand dollar dresses and seemed to be ' constantly checking us out , comparing my family to hers and complaining			0
' she also said she felt like she had to ' watch her back around her			0
' royalty : @entity2 said @entity78 held herself ' like a queen ' in the years since 2008 , ms @entity5 has fostered her own time in the limelight , appearing frequently as a young conservative pundit in media , blogging for @entity104 and constantly updating her 112,000 @entity106 followers			1
on june 17 , in response to @entity2 's remarks , the firebrand tweeted : ' " hi , i 'm @entity5 " is in no way , shape or form a pickup line			2
trust me honey , you 'd know it if i was hitting on you			0
' ms @entity2 wrote that she was mystified when mrs @entity5 offered to be a godmother to her unborn baby @entity118 : ' i had just met her and i wondered why she wanted any type of guardianship over my child '			2
though the @entity122 can rest east that ms @entity2 seems to have saved her deepest jabs for former fianc√©e @entity47 , who has his own tell - all book scheduled for release this fall			1
she refers to her baby 's daddy as a ' gnat ' who ' cheated on me about as frequently as he sharpened his hockey skates '			0
she writes that while her parents allegedly ' accepted ' her pregnancy , he was n't so supportive , saying the child ' better be a f * * king boy '			0
ms @entity2 claims that mr @entity47 plied her with wine coolers before taking her virginity , then promised it would n't happen again until they were married			1
that apparently did n't go as planned , as she would become pregnant with his child shortly after			0
later , she claims he admitted to seeing another woman while he was staying at the @entity2 home with her , and eventually , that he had gotten another women pregnant .			1

also claims she threw a tantrum because she had to wait to get her hair and make - up done
resented that she was n't getting as much air time as @entity2
