by @entity0 published : 17:13 est , 30 april 2012 updated : 17:13 est , 30 april 2012 heartbreak : @entity1 holds her newborn baby , @entity3 , who is slowly being weaned from prescription methadone less than a month old , @entity5 scrunches her tiny face into a scowl as a nurse gently squirts a dose of methadone into her mouth			2
the infant is going through drug withdrawal and is being treated with the same narcotic prescribed for her mother to fight addiction to powerful prescription painkillers			1
disturbing new research says the number of @entity22 babies born with signs of opiate drug withdrawal has tripled in a decade because of a surge in pregnant women 's use of legal and illegal narcotics , including @entity29 , @entity30 and heroin , researchers say			1
it is the first national study of the problem			2
the number of newborns with withdrawal symptoms increased from a little more than 1 per 1,000 babies sent home from the hospital in 2000 to more than 3 per 1,000 in 2009 , the study found			1
more than 13,000 @entity22 infants were affected in 2009 , the researchers estimated			1
the newborns include babies like @entity3 , whose mother stopped abusing painkillers and switched to prescription methadone early in pregnancy , and those whose mothers are still abusing legal or illegal drugs			2
weaning infants from these drugs can take weeks or months and often requires a lengthy stay in intensive care units			2
hospital charges for treating these newborns soared from $ 190million to $ 720million between 2000 and 2009 , the study found			1
the study was released online monday in the @entity58			0
@entity3 is hooked up to heart and oxygen monitors in an @entity61 , @entity62 , newborn intensive care unit			0
@entity64 : this graph shows the steady rise in the rate of mothers using opiates between 2000 and 2009 in a pink crib , she sleeps fitfully , sometimes cries all night , and has had diarrhea and trouble feeding - typical signs of withdrawal			1
some affected babies also have breathing problems , low birth weights and seizures			1
it nearly breaks her young mother 's heart			0
' it 's really hard , every day , emotionally and physically , ' said @entity1 , 25			0
' it 's really hard when your daughter is born addicted			1
' doctors say newborns are n't really addicted , but their bodies are dependent on methadone or other opiates because of their mothers ' use during pregnancy			1
priorities : @entity1 is now staying clean and is in nursing school , but visits her daughter in the hospital every day small methadone doses to wean them off these drugs is safer than cutting them off altogether , which can cause dangerous seizures and even death , said dr @entity106 , chief of pediatrics at @entity108 in @entity109			1
newborn drug withdrawal is rampant in @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , parts of the @entity115 and other sections of the country			1
dr @entity118 , the lead author of the study and a newborn specialist at the @entity122 health system in @entity123 , called the problem a ' public health epidemic ' that demands attention from policymakers , as well as from researchers to clarify what long - term problems these infants may face			2
@entity111 scientist @entity132 said her research suggests some affected infants suffer developmental delays in early childhood , but whether those problems persist is uncertain			1
it 's the 21st century version of what was known as the ' crack baby ' epidemic of the 1980s			0
disturbing trend : children of drug - addicted moms is reminiscent of the ' crack baby ' epidemic of the late 1970s and early 1980s where children underwent narcotic withdrawal some experts say that epidemic was overblown and that infants born to mothers using crack cocaine face no serious long - term health problems			1
newborns addicted some think the current problem is being overblown , too			2
@entity158 , an assistant psychiatry professor at @entity159 and a substance abuse researcher at the @entity161 , noted that only a tiny portion of the estimated 4 million @entity22 infants born each year are affected			1
@entity158 also said the study probably includes women who were n't abusing drugs during pregnancy , but were taking prescribed painkillers for legitimate reasons			0
he said he worries that the study will unfairly stigmatize pregnant women who are ' doing the right thing ' by taking methadone to fight their addiction			0
doctors pushing powerful painkillers ' like candy ' contribute to the problem , said @entity179 , who runs the @entity181 substance abuse program that @entity1 attends			0
patients at his @entity184 clinic include men and women who are prescribed opiate painkillers for legitimate reasons , such as car accident injuries , and find themselves addicted when the prescriptions runs out			2
some turn to street drugs , which can be cheaper and easier to obtain , @entity179 said			0
in some states , mothers of newborns with drug withdrawal are arrested and jailed , but @entity179 said addiction is a brain disease that should be treated like other illnesses , not stigmatized			1
@entity1 said she started abusing drugs after an adult neighbor introduced her to crack when she was 14			0
she said she would ' never have touched it ' if she had known how addictive drugs can be			0
she said she has abused @entity29 , which a doctor gave her to treat back pain from sitting all day at an office job , as well as other prescription painkillers and heroin			0
@entity1 was still abusing drugs early in her pregnancy but decided in december to quit , vowing : ' i 'm not going to go back to that lifestyle			0
there 's a baby inside me			0
' alarming : the number of babies born with signs of opiate drug withdrawal has tripled in a decade due mostly to a surge in pregnant women 's use of legal and illegal narcotics , including @entity29 and @entity30 now she is trying to get her life back on track			1
estranged from her husband , she is living with her parents and just signed up for nursing classes at a local junior college			0
she visits @entity3 every day			0
the baby has been in the hospital since she was born in early april , and her mother hopes to take her home soon			2
