former steel worker @entity1 , 42 , was fitted with a mechanical heart and is on the transplant list for a new organ after being diagnosed with a weak heart			1
experts warned there was a 50 per cent chance he had passed on his condition , so @entity1 and his wife @entity18 , 31 , took their four sons , aged eight to four , for tests			1
the couple were devastated to discover that all four youngsters - @entity22 , eight , @entity24 , seven , @entity25 , five , and @entity26 , four - have the same life - threatening condition			1
and the couple 's two year - old daughter @entity28 could also be a sufferer , although she is too young for a conclusive diagnosis			0
@entity1 's father @entity32 , 63 , has also been diagnosed with the same condition - dilated cardiomyopathy - which weakens and enlarges the heart so it can not pump blood properly			1
his sons now face a lifetime of medication in a bid to keep the condition at bay - and could all need a full heart transplant in the future			2
the father - of - five admitted yesterday that had he known he had the hereditary problem , he may have limited his family to just one child			2
mr @entity1 said : ' if we 'd known what i had was hereditary - if somebody had explained it to us - we would probably have stopped at one kid			1
' when we were told that there was a 50/50 chance that the kids would have it i thought maybe one or two would - we never imagined all the boys would have it			0
' taking them up to the hospital for the tests , it was horrible			0
the family have since been given the devastating news that @entity1 's three sons , @entity22 , @entity25 and @entity24 , have the same condition			1
called ' dilated cardiomyopathy ' , it means the heart is not strong enough to pump blood around his body @entity1 and his wife @entity18 have also been warned that their two year - old daughter @entity28 could also be a sufferer , although she is too young for a conclusive diagnosis ' i took the four boys first , and you are just hoping that they are alright , and you think that maybe one of them has it , but when you hear four of them do - it was just gutting			1
i ca n't stop blaming myself , it is hard not to			0
' mr @entity1 , from @entity86 , @entity87 , was first diagnosed with an enlarged heart in 2000 when he began to feel breathless at work			1
thanks to medication , he led a normal life until he suffered two heart attacks in 2006 when medics then diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy			1
@entity1 was forced to give up work and was fitted with a tiny machine under his skin which delivered an electric shock to his heart if it began to beat abnormally			2
following his heart attacks , @entity1 was fitted with a mechanical heart with a battery - powered pump which compensates for his heart 's failures ( pictured )			1
he is also on the transplant list but at a birthday party in january 2011 , he began to feel unwell again and was rushed to @entity108 where he had 13 heart attacks in just two days			0
at one point , mrs @entity110 watched in horror as his heart stopped completely for 45 minutes and doctors considered stopping treatment			0
but the father - of - five miraculously pulled through and was fitted with a battery - powered pump which compensates for his heart 's failures			2
it was only when his own father was diagnosed with the same condition late last year that @entity1 and @entity18 realised their children could also be a risk			1
doctors told them there was a 50 per cent chance they would also have it and tests in april confirmed their worst fears			2
mrs @entity110 is now a full - time carer for her husband who has to wear a battery - filled backpack which powers the pump below his heart while he waits for a transplant			2
he added : ' some days it 's good , some days i ca n't get up the stairs without getting really tired ' the boys are all on medication to control the condition and are so far unaffected by it , while @entity28 is currently healthy but could develop it as her heart grows			0

he added : ' some days it 's good , some days i ca n't get up the stairs without getting really tired			0
' but now i guess i have put myself on the back burner and just think about the kids			0
' they 're ok just now			0
they still go to their afterschool clubs and play football and the rest of it			0
' but they could all of them need a transplant in the future , although it 's too early to tell at the moment			0
' now they are all on medication we just hope it is a long long time before it affects them			0
