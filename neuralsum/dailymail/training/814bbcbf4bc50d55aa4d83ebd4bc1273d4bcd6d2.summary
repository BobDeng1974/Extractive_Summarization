it 's long been known that salamanders are capable of growing new limbs , but scientists believe they have finally discovered how the process works			0
researchers at @entity6 ( @entity6 ) identified a biological pathway , called @entity8 ( extracellular signal - regulated kinases ) , must be constantly active for salamander cells to regenerate - a process not seen in the same way in other mammals			1
although a long way from achieving the same feat in humans , the discovery could help researchers unlock the ‘ regenerative potential ’ of cells across other animals			1
scientists may have uncovered the secret of the salamander 's ability to grow new limbs			0
though a long way from achieving the same feat in people , the discovery could help researchers unlock the ' regenerative potential ' of human cells			1

a study claims that wild salamanders in @entity47 are getting smaller as their surroundings get warmer and drier , forcing them to burn more energy in a hotter climate			2
researchers from the @entity53 found that salamanders in the @entity55 today were nearly a tenth smaller than their ancestors in the 1950s			0
the changes were most marked in the @entity55 and at low elevations - settings where detailed weather records showed the climate has warmed and dried out most			0
scientists have predicted that some animals will get smaller in response to climate change and , the researchers sasy , this is strong confirmation of that prediction			0
in the same way , the creatures are able to regenerate tails , jaws , eyes , organs and even spinal cords			0
in adult mammalian cells , the @entity8 pathway is not fully active			1
when forced to be , cells acquire a greater potential for reprogramming and regeneration			2
the researchers announced their findings in the journal @entity83			0
through the @entity8 pathway , proteins communicate signals from a cell ’s surface to the nucleus containing its genetic material			2
‘ while humans have limited regenerative abilities , other organisms , such as the salamander , are able to regenerate an impressive repertoire of complex structures including parts of their hearts , eyes , spinal cord , tails , and they are the only adult vertebrates able to regenerate full limbs , ' said @entity104 scientist dr @entity103 from @entity6 ’s @entity105			2
‘ we ’re thrilled to have found a critical molecular pathway , the @entity8 pathway , that determines whether an adult cell is able to be reprogrammed and help the regeneration processes			1
‘ manipulating this mechanism could contribute to therapies directed at enhancing regenerative potential of human cells			1
’ further research will now focus on understanding how the important pathway is regulated during limb regeneration , and which other molecules are involved in the process			2

study has identified a biological pathway that controls regeneration
called @entity8 , it must be constantly active for salamander cells to reprogram
this activity is not seen in the cells of other adult mammals
@entity150 may help unlock ‘ regenerative potential ’ of cells in more animals
salamanders are amphibians renowned for a capacity to regrow body parts
