by @entity0 published : 02:54 est , 14 april 2012 updated : 05:04 est , 14 april 2012 bookies are running scared today as they face a £ 10 million hit if a woman wins the @entity4 for the first time today			1
millions are set to watch sisters - in - law @entity7 , 27 , and @entity9 , also 27 , set their family loyalty aside and battle for racing 's biggest prize at @entity14			1
the highly - rated pair , who were bridesmaid and bride two months ago , are both from two racing dynasties and have rode winners at @entity20 but no woman has ever gone that step further and won the world 's greatest steeplechase			0
good friends : jockeys and sisters - in - law @entity9 , left , and @entity7 , right , are both riding in the @entity28 's @entity4 today and are backed to make history the day job : @entity9 , left , and @entity7 , right , will don their silks this afternoon and try to stay the 4.5 mile @entity14 course @entity9 , whose dad @entity35 rode @entity36 to a glorious win in 1972 , is on the much - fancied @entity38 , and married @entity7 ’s brother , @entity39 , in february			1
while her sister - in - law will try to stay the four - and - a - half - mile course on @entity42 , trained by her father @entity43 , who won with @entity44 in 2000			2
35 years since @entity46 became the first woman to ride in the race , 18 female - ridden runners have started since but never won			2
' i 'm looking forward to it , it 's a great opportunity and i might never have a ride in the race again , so i just want to enjoy the whole thing , ' ms @entity7 said today			1
lady 's first : @entity9 can land the @entity4 and her horse is much - fancied by the punters dressed for success : @entity9 , left and right , is a regular fixture in the winner 's enclosure but could make history today ' as women riders we are not treated any differently and we would n't expect to be , but at some stage a woman is going to win a @entity67 on the flat or the @entity4 and i just hope it 's me			1
' ' if you ’re not in , you ca n’t win , and hopefully he takes to the jumps , ' @entity9 added about her horse @entity38 yesterday			1
' he jumps well at home but you just do n’t know until you line up			0
' and the bookies fear they will be ' kicked where it hurts ' if either woman wins the race at 4.15pm			2
' although women jockeys in the race have been relatively commonplace since @entity85 became the first of her sex to complete the course aboard @entity89 in 1982 , this year ’s @entity4 breaks new ground – two female riders with strong chances , ' @entity83 ' @entity82 told the @entity93			0
what @entity7 did : @entity7 has a big chance with @entity95 and will go all out to beat her sister - in - law and the rest of the field both have ridden winners at the @entity20 – the most competitive environment there is in jump racing – so there is no doubt as to their talent and nerve			2
' as a result , a victory for either would kick us where it hurts – we could be looking at losses of £ 10million			0
' but it is racing hero @entity113 , who broke his national duck at the 15th attempt on @entity116 two years ago , who has the potential to inflict one of the worst results ever on bookmakers if @entity121 becomes the first horse since @entity123 in 1934 to win the top prize of last month 's @entity20 and the @entity4 in the same season			0
on 16 occasions the @entity127 winner has lined up for the @entity4 , most recently @entity129 , who finished seventh in 1995			0
hard act to follow : @entity121 is aiming to emulate @entity123 by doubling up			0

@entity7 , 27 , is on @entity42 and @entity9 , also 27 , will ride @entity38 this afternoon
if either makes history the bookies are set to be hit for £ 10 million
