house speaker @entity0 lashed out at @entity1 in the @entity2 on wednesday , shouting that they should ' get off their a * * ' and fund the @entity4			1
he blasted liberals in the upper house of @entity7 for blocking a series of votes because of provisions that would kill president @entity12 's sweeping immigration policy overhaul			1
@entity0 even mocked them by bringing up a pamphlet sold in the congressional gift shop describing how a bill becomes a law			0
the president announced in november that he planned to guarantee those who came to the country illegally ' @entity33 did its job			0
we won the fight to fund the @entity4 and to stop the president 's unconstitutional actions , ' @entity0 told reporters during a weekly press briefing			2
' now it 's time for the @entity2 to do their work			2
you know , in the gift shop out here they 've got these little booklets on how a bill becomes a law			0
right ? ' ' @entity33 has done its job			0
now why do n't you go ask the @entity1 when they 're going to get off their ass and do something â€“ other than to vote " no " ? ' ' the issue here is not @entity64 , ' he said			1
' the issue here is @entity1			0
' it 's not clear how the impasse will be resolved since republicans in both chambers insist they have no plans for further action			0
the likeliest outcome may be another short - term extension of current funding levels for the @entity4 , something agency leaders say would jeopardize their ability to make needed changes at the @entity80 , @entity81 and other agencies			2
the issue has emerged with @entity64 in their second month of full congressional control after four years of holding the majority in the @entity31 but not the @entity2			1
@entity31 @entity64 have been frustrated to discover that because of @entity2 rules giving significant rights to the minority party , little has changed and they still ca n't get their bills through the @entity2			1
@entity0 's comments seemed highly unlikely to change @entity1 ' behavior			0
on tuesday , senate majority leader @entity92 declared the @entity2 ' stuck ' on the issue and said the next move was in the @entity31 's court			1
@entity0 rejected that , insisting @entity1 , led by minority leader @entity26 of @entity96 , are at fault			0
the @entity31 on wednesday called @entity64 ' behavior ' irresponsible ' and accused them of playing politics with national security			1
' i do think that it raises questions about whether or not @entity64 are prepared to assume the responsibility the @entity108 people have given then to run the @entity7 , ' the president 's spokesman told reporters			1
pointing out that the @entity111 gives @entity7 the power of the purse , @entity31 press secretary @entity110 said , ' this is a matter that the president cant solve for them			2
' ' they are the ones that have to make the funding decisions , ' he said			0
' and i do n't think there 's anybody who thinks its a good idea , @entity125 or @entity21 , for us to not fund the @entity4 , particularly at this time when our homeland faces some pretty serious threats			1
' ' so it is time for @entity64 to set aside politics , to focus on their core responsibility to fund the @entity4 , ' @entity110 said			2
if they do that , he said , they will find a @entity135 president who will work with them to ' ensure that our @entity4 has the resources necessary to protect the @entity108 people			0
' @entity0 's comments wednesday underscored a worsening stalemate on @entity142 with funding for the @entity4 set to expire feb. 27			1

@entity31 @entity64 have passed a homeland security funding bill that guts @entity12 's ability to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants
the @entity2 is *gridlocked* on the measure as @entity1 are united to block it and the @entity21 ca n't *muster* *60* votes to bring the measure to a vote
@entity7 passed a *budget* in *december* but left out @entity4 , whose funding runs out feb. 27
republicans are trying to use the congressional *checkbook* as leverage to get @entity12 to back down on a plan to give illegal immigrants new residency cards and work permits
@entity31 said the *incident* ' raises questions about whether or not @entity64 are prepared ' to run @entity7
