by @entity0 published : 13:49 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 04:38 est , 12 september 2013 @entity1 speaking at the @entity2 earlier this week the @entity3 is under growing pressure to fire its director of human resources after she was accused of lying to @entity7 about the severance pay scandal			1
@entity1 , who earns £ 320,000 a year , said she could not recall using the word in a leaked email which was discussed at the @entity2 this week			1
but when asked if she had used the term , @entity11 replied : ' i may have used the term by means of an incentive to get a swift resolution			0
' @entity11 has already said she will leave the @entity3 in april but there are calls for her resign now			1
@entity22 mp @entity21 said : ‘ she should go now			0
she has been proved to be incompetent and she misled the committee			0
after her performance this week , the @entity3 has significant grounds to let her go immediately			1
‘ here you have a highly paid woman who has n’t been behaving in the way that she should , but is allowed to dictate the terms of her own departure			0
‘ if the @entity3 is to regain the public trust , it needs to get a grip and start disciplinary proceedings against all those who signed off excessive severance payments			1
’ cheers reportedly rang out in the @entity3 newsroom on monday when @entity11 was branded a liar by @entity7			1
miss @entity1 protested the verdict on her was unfair , but committee chairman @entity42 declared : ' you 're developing a habit of changing your evidence			2
' miss @entity1 was accused of completely contradicting herself			2
at one point , mrs @entity42 told her : ' i 'm not having any more lies this afternoon			0
' the outburst apparently sparked a wave of disloyal jubilation within the @entity51 as staff watched the exchange on live television			2
the @entity3 ’s own media correspondent , the respected @entity55 , tweeted : ‘ there was an audible cheer in the @entity3 newsroom when @entity42 accused @entity59 director @entity1 of lying to the @entity60			1
’ conservative mp @entity61 , who also a member of the committee , says he obtained the email			0
he said : ‘ the email shines a light on the real culture of the @entity59 department which saw payments [ that went beyond ] contractual terms as simply perks of the job			2
the @entity2 met this week to discuss severance payouts ‘ clearly the decision to leave the @entity3 removed some of the need for further questioning , but it was clear she had lost the confidence of the committee in the accuracy of her recollections			1
’ he added : ‘ i think her position is untenable and it is surprising that she will be continuing at the @entity3 until next spring when it is clear that , on more than one occasion , she denied any knowledge of material documents that she wrote before parliament			0
‘ i found it a very sad day to see an institution with so many talented and hard - working staff being led by people paid telephone - number salaries and performing in a way that fell far short of what those staff deserve			0
’ another mp on the committee , @entity106 , said the ‘ sweetener ’ email was a ‘ clear sign of the attitude of senior executives at the @entity3 to these above - contract payments ’			0
he added : ‘ whilst concern about sweeteners for senior officers was expressed , the evidence from the @entity117 shows that as you go down the ‘ food chain ’ your chances of an above - contract deal receded			0
’ a @entity3 spokeswoman said : ‘ although the @entity3 has not seen the email , @entity1 explained the context in which this term might be used at the hearing			1

@entity1 earns £ 320,000 a year as @entity59 director of the @entity3
the director has already said she will leave the @entity51 in april
however , there are calls for her to quit immediately following *allegations* presented at the @entity2 this week
