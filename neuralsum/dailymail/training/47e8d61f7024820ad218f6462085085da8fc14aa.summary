by @entity0 published : 08:42 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 10:58 est , 24 october 2012 fossilised turtle shells plucked from a @entity3 rubbish dump have been judged to be the oldest and most complete palaeontologists have yet discovered			1
dating back 215million years , experts say the shells could provide invaluable clues in solving the riddle of the origin of this ancient reptile which is venerated by cultures across the globe			1
' i 'd say my guardian angel led me here , ' said @entity15 , the palaeobiologist who made the discovery			2
ancient : a fossil of one of the world 's oldest - known turtle shells with a limb bone dating from 215million years ago , discovered in clay deposit in a rubbish dump north - west of @entity25 , @entity3 his investigation was led by a hunch that inspired him to poke around a landfill near the town of @entity31 - in a region known as the @entity33 - in september 2008			1
@entity34 came after just 15 minutes as he unearthed a prized turtle fossil , which recent tests have now confirmed to be the oldest found so far anywhere in the world			1
the prestigious @entity39 and @entity40 recently published details of the discovery			0
' late - @entity44 turtle fossils are extremely rare			1
there are around eight spots on @entity47 where you might find them , and here in @entity3 we ’ve unearthed the oldest and most extensive collection , ' dr @entity15 told @entity53			0
' finding something that has been in the mud for 215million years , it ’s like bringing it back to life , ' he added			1
' i 'd say my guardian angel led me here ' : @entity61 @entity15 says he was led to the site by a hunch and unearthed the fossil after just 15 minutes hunting the bright yellow spokes on the shell of a @entity69 native to @entity70 catch the eye of school children visiting the @entity73			1
' they ’re like army tanks with their heavy armour ! ' exclaims 12 - year - old @entity77			0
but the shells that have afforded turtles protection from predators for aeons are no match for humans			1
hunted for meat , traditional medicine or caught in the illegal pet trade , this species could become extinct during @entity77 ’s lifetime			0
about half of the globe ’s 328 recognised species of fresh water and marine turtles and land - faring tortoises could vanish in the coming decades , according to the @entity95			0
' after being here for a couple hundred million years , dozens of species of turtles are now on the verge of extinction , quite simply due to being captured or eaten on an unprecedented scale , particularly in @entity102 , ' says @entity103 , reptile keeper at the zoo			1
known to live up to 130 years , these ancient creatures carry deep meaning as primordial symbols of longevity , stability , security and wisdom and feature in creation myths from @entity114 to native @entity115			1
yet their future seems bleak			0
' being realistic about the modern - day threats they face , especially in south - east @entity102 , @entity121 , the @entity122 , @entity123 or @entity70 , turtles are disappearing fast , ' @entity103 warned			0
' some species could vanish within 20 years if radical steps are n’t taken to protect them now			1
' while turtle fossils of a similar age were also discovered in @entity130 , the @entity3 find includes shells , along with neck and tail vertebrae , as well as limb bones that are unique			1
' we ’ve discovered two species , including one which is unknown , ' dr @entity15 said			2
his team have identified a @entity141 - type turtle similar to a single @entity141 robusta fossil found in @entity130 , while another appears to be of a smaller , as yet unknown species			0
this region ’s picturesque , craggy countryside , shaped during the @entity149 era and known for vast nearby coal reserves , has proven to be a prehistoric treasure trove			2
dr @entity15 ’s discovery came on the heels of a new 200million - year - old dinosaur species unearthed in nearby @entity155 in 2006 - 7			0
it was christened the @entity157 - after a fabled fire - breathing dragon , whose rumoured lair was in a cave at the foot of @entity25 ’s 14th century @entity163			0
other digs in the area have turned up several hundred fossils from six species including turtles , sharks , scaled fish and dinosaurs			0
now , dr @entity15 says his mission is to find a turtle skull			2
though fossils carry no organic material for dna testing , their structures hold precious clues to the origins of species			0
' each new turtle fossil is invaluable as it could provide clues to their origin , which up to now has been a bit of a mystery , ' he said			0
these most ancient of creatures are thought to have evolved from @entity188 , a type of parareptile living in the @entity192 period up to 300million years ago			2
the @entity193 , a 2008 find in @entity121 dating back 220million years has also been classed by experts as a turtle ancestor , which like them had a belly shell , but unlike them had teeth and no full top shell			1
dna tests on modern - day turtles suggest they may be related to crocodiles , according to dr @entity15			2
adding to the intrigue , @entity188 are not thought to be related to crocs , he said .			0

tests show the shells date back 215million years to the @entity44 era
@entity61 following a hunch discovered them in a landfill site
now he hopes to continue investigations in the hope of finding a skull
