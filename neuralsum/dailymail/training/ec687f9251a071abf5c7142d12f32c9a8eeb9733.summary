by @entity0 published : 09:35 est , 5 november 2012 updated : 10:26 est , 5 november 2012 a young family fell ill after relocating to a suburban home which unbeknown to them had been used by the last tenants as a huge marijuana greenhouse			1
@entity6 , her husband @entity7 and four children recently moved from @entity9 to @entity10 , @entity11 after @entity7 lost his job			1
almost immediately , the family became sick , complaining of sore throats , stinging eyes and congestion			2
mrs @entity6 said her two - year - old daughter was the sickest			2
no one had been living at the home but it had been used by drug dealers to grow 400 plants			1
mrs @entity6 told tv station @entity39 : ' my eyes were burning			0
' then i became very congested			0
my youngest daughter started getting green goop in her eyes , and she would cough until she threw up			0
' it was then that mrs @entity6 discovered mould growing all over the house , in particular in her youngest daughter 's bedroom			0
busted : in august , a sting operation uncovered 400 plants being grown at the home by drug dealers behind closed doors : the suburban home was raided by narcotics officers in august where 400 cannabis plants were found inside the sickly conditions appear to have been caused by the ' greenhouse ' conditions of the marijuana factory			1
the heat in the house was kept high and water sprayed , making the atmosphere damp and humid			0
along with her concerns for her family 's health , mrs @entity6 was also worried what the environment would do to irreplaceable family heirlooms such as the 1930s grand piano she inherited when her grandmother died last year			2
although landlords must tell prospective tenants if the home has previously been used to cook methamphetamine , they are not obliged to reveal if the property has been used to grow marijuana			1
the owner has now agreed to return the family 's $ 2,000 deposit and $ 2,000 rent they had paid			0
cover - up : @entity6 was worried for her family 's well - being following the revelation about the house 's past damages : when the family examined the home closer , there was mould growing in the walls and vents ( left )			1

the @entity103 and their four children relocated from @entity9 to @entity11
the family were unaware the home had been raided by *police* in august as part of drugs operation involving 50 homes
landlords not *required* to tell renters if home has been used to grow cannabis - although must reveal if property was once a meth *lab*
