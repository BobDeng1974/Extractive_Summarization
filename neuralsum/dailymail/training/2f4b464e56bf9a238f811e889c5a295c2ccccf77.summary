another victim falls for a @entity2 hoax with @entity4 mp @entity3 unknowingly retweeting a photo of @entity7 serial killer @entity6			1
the troll struck just 24 hours after @entity9 was tricked into retweeting a photo of @entity7 serial killers @entity12 and @entity13 which enraged the tycoon who retorted suggesting that he may sue over the prank			1
mr @entity3 replied just as disapprovingly after he had retweeted a post : ' my @entity18 , @entity20 was a huge supported buy passed away before he could vote for you			2
please rt in his memory ' alongside a photo of the notorious killer who murdered up to 250 people in @entity27 between the 1970s and 1990s			2
the hoax that fooled @entity4 mp @entity3 to retweet the photo of serial killer @entity6 it is pointed out to mr @entity3 that the picture is in fact of a deceased notorious serial killer the @entity36 political party leader expresses that he is far from impressed by the prank mr @entity3 was led to believe that @entity6 was a supporter of his who died before being able to vote for him once a @entity2 user pointed out that @entity6 had killed 200 people , mr @entity3 accidentally replied to the wrong person , instead of the prankster , calling him a ' humourless cow ' , @entity38 reported			1
it was then that who appeared to be the real troll stepped forward and tried to smooth over the online jape			0
' you 're a good man and a good sport ; i 've just go to keep politician 's on their toes			0
all the best for your next term			0
' the cheeky culprit posted			0
the embarrassing gaff included pretending that @entity6 was a supporter of the mp - although the man hung himself in his cell at @entity60 in @entity61 the day before his 58th birthday in january 2004 after being jailed for life for murdering up to 250 people but was only charged for 15 of the cases			1
the supposed prankster tries to make light of the @entity2 hoax while mr @entity9 's hoax involved pretending that the @entity71 couple deemed the @entity73 business magnate as an inspiration			1
the infamous pair tortured and raped numerous young women and girls and murdered at least 11 of them - including their own family members			0
mr @entity9 deleted the post about 40 minutes later then called the troll a ' jerk ' and said he would consider suing the culprit for the prank ' i thought was being kind to somebody re their parents			2
i guess this teaches you to not to be nice or trusting			0
@entity9 was tricked into retweeting the married serial killing couple @entity12 and @entity13 the wealthy businessman did n't take it lying down - suggesting he may sue the culprit			1

@entity4 mp @entity3 was tricked into retweeting on *tuesday*
@entity99 asked him to retweet a photo of his *father* who was a supporter
but the image was of @entity7 serial killer @entity6
the @entity36 political party leader called him a ' humourless cow '
this comes as @entity9 was fooled in a *similar* way on *monday*
