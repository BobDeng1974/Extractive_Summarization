@entity32 , six , from near @entity33 , was suspended from his school after he took a bag of @entity36 in his packed lunch before later being expelled for more food related problems			1
@entity40 insisted he was not excluded ' for just having @entity36 in their lunchbox ' but because there had been a ' persistent and deliberate breach of school policy , such as bringing in crisps , biscuits , sausage rolls , mini sausages , scotch eggs and similar '			1
a school is banning parents from watching their children play sport unless they pay £ 26 to undergo a criminal records check			1

father @entity90 compared the practice to something you might see in a ' @entity4 workhouse '			1
' i 'm livid that the school did a humiliating thing like this to @entity29 and his classmates , ' he told @entity99 ' it 's disgusting and degrading — the kind of thing you 'd expect in a @entity4 workhouse , not a school in 2014			1
' i 've told other parents about it and like me they had no idea this was being done			1
people are furious and i 've no idea what the head and teachers thought they were playing at			1
that sign needs ripping up and chucking in the bin '			2

' we have had some issues recently with the way the @entity127 boys have been behaving in the toilets			0
some doors were damaged and sinks and toilets have been blocked leading to the toilet block flooding , ' she said			0
' to address this issue we produced a sign for boys to carry to the toilet to help us check that only one pupil was in there at a time			2
one of our parents expressed concern with the signs and we immediately stopped using them			2
' we are currently reviewing our procedures in light of the concerns raised			0
we are sorry if this has caused any distress or upset			0
' it came just days after a primary school teacher in @entity152 was suspended for @entity153 over the mouths of her 10 - year - old pupils after they refused to stop giggling and talking			2
parents with children at the school said they were angry at the decision			1
@entity161 , 32 , whose six - year - old son @entity162 is a pupil , said : ' i would n't be happy at all if he came home and told me he 'd had to wear one of these signs			0
' it 's like they are being labelled as trouble - makers			0

' embarrassing : pupils were forced to walk the corridors with the sign on after damage to the toilets @entity180 , 31 , has a seven - year - old son at the school			1
she said : ' it 's unbelievable			0
this should never have happened			0
' there must have been a better way of dealing with this			0
to make a child wear a degrading sign around their neck is n't right at all			2

@entity195 , 27 , allegedly lined up more than 20 children during her art lesson and put layers of sticky tape across their lips because they were being too noisy			0
