@entity0 is one of the game ’s most colourful and outspoken characters			1
here , in the latest extract from his fascinating book , he reveals the clamour for @entity7 's signature and charts the beginning of @entity11 football 's influx of foreign talent			1
where are @entity15 's friends when he needs them most ? my team of the 1970s my team of the 1980s i go back a long way with @entity7			1
he came for a trial at @entity21 in 1966 and i would drive him to training			1
the 15 - year - old @entity7 was with us for two weeks — everyone in the country was trying to sign him			1
i had a little green @entity27 and would collect him and another @entity29 lad , @entity28 , from digs			2
@entity0 was playing for @entity21 as a youngster when @entity7 trialed at the club @entity0 ( seen playing for @entity21 ) used to drive the 15 - year - old @entity7 into training @entity0 used to give lifts to @entity7 and @entity28 from their digs in an @entity36 @entity7 ( seen scoring against @entity37 ) was a wanted man and went on to sign for @entity38 soon after @entity7 as a youngster coming through the ranks one saturday morning we had a practice match and manager @entity43 played him with the first - team players			1
one of the lads laid a ball to him and it was like fast - forwarding through the next 20 years of @entity49 football — he took it perfectly , dropped a shoulder , turned and curled it into the far corner of the net			1
our reserves did n’t know what had hit them			2
both sets of players just stopped and applauded			2
i can remember talking to @entity43 about him after that game			2
‘ will we get him ? ’ i asked			2
‘ no chance , ’ he said			2
everybody wants him , but he ’s going to @entity38			1
’ i do n’t remember him being very talkative then , but i ’m not sure i would have understood a word anyway			2
the strength of @entity7 ’s @entity65 accent is legendary			1
when @entity66 wanted to sign my son , @entity67 , @entity7 rang up to speak to us about it			1
i could hear my wife , @entity69 , on the phone but i did n’t know who she was talking to			2
‘ i ’m sorry , ’ she kept saying			2
‘ i ca n’t understand your @entity73 accent			2
’ she must have said it about four times			2
in the end , i heard her say the name @entity7			1
i took the phone , just in time to hear @entity7 saying in the broadest @entity29 tone you ’ll ever hear , ‘ can ye nae understan ’ me ? ’ @entity7 enjoyed eight successful years at @entity83 ( pictured playing in an @entity84 against @entity85 ) @entity7 wheels away after scoring the winner for @entity66 at @entity88 against @entity89 in 1985 - 86 that ’s my missus			1
she ’s got to be about the only person who does n’t know @entity7 is from @entity29			1
‘ i thought he was from @entity66 , ’ she said			1
‘ no , he manages @entity66 — he was born in @entity65 , ’ i replied			1
we got there in the end			2
@entity7 was just a fantastic player			1
he could hold the ball as well as any man twice his size ; he could bring team - mates into play or take it on himself			1
he did n’t have pace , but that did n’t matter			2
his pace was in his head			2
he was the attacking equivalent of @entity108 , in that he read the play better than anybody			0
he scored 30 goals in his first season for @entity66 , including the winner in the 1978 @entity115 final against @entity116			1
it allowed them to maintain this fantastic period of dominance in the @entity11 game			0
@entity122 played a huge role in @entity66 ’s domination , too			1
@entity122 ’s transfer fee , £ 350,000 , sounds like a snip — but it was a record for a move between two @entity11 clubs in 1978 when he signed from @entity129			1
and , just like @entity131 and @entity132 , he was happy whatever way you wanted to play the game			0
a pure football match , and he was the best player on the field			0
a tear - up , and he would be nastier than anybody			1
@entity122 seemed to have a particular problem with @entity141 , a @entity142 midfielder who played for @entity143			1
in one game , @entity141 went in high on @entity122 , and soon afterwards @entity122 put him out of football for two months			1
players thought he was evil and he liked intimidating people			0
that was part of his job			0
the only person i know he ’s scared of is his wife , @entity151			0
@entity7 with @entity122 after winning the 1984 @entity154 ( left ) and his iconic picture as a @entity157 legend @entity7 with manager @entity158 alongside the @entity115 on the day he signed for @entity66 in 1977 by the end of the 1970s , @entity159 , @entity160 ( both @entity161 ) , @entity162 and @entity163 ( both @entity164 ) had come to our game			1
it was the beginning of the thought process that foreign players were needed for the skilful jobs because our own players were n’t up to it			0
much of the blame for that can be laid at the door of @entity177			0
the former pe teacher became the assistant director of coaching at the @entity181 and rose to a position of great power and influence in the game			0
under him , we missed an opportunity , thinking that we could teach the @entity189 about football rather than the other way around			0
we told ourselves that @entity189 were getting it wrong with all those passes ! @entity160 ( seen playing for @entity161 against @entity193 in 1978 ) was one of @entity11 football 's first foreign imports @entity161 also signed the mercurial @entity196 @entity159 ( pictured in the 1980s ) in their ranks @entity198 would have solved @entity200 's problems ... he was born to play left wing @entity202 heralded a change in @entity11 football ... he introduced @entity205 and scouting reports @entity207 has the class of @entity209 but his attitude is holding back his talent @entity212 and @entity213 are warriors ... they were even prepared to do battle while working on tv ! why @entity0 fears that the @entity11 manager is in danger of becoming extinct @entity212 nearly crossed @entity219 to join @entity161 ... and @entity220 was close to signing too pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players ... the @entity221 killed all that ! @entity227 's @entity229 interviews @entity0 about his new book even now , there are very few @entity49 coaches bold enough to try to play a very technical game			1
the long ball , the quick fix , will always be easier			0
all of the coaching courses back then were run by men like @entity177			0
there was no flair — it was football as taught by @entity243 instructors			0
some of them had even been to @entity189 , but they returned with some madcap ideas			0
@entity189 footballers hone their skills on the beach , we were told			0
it was where they learned to control a football and , we were informed , that was how we should do it , too			0
where the manager of , say , @entity259 was going to find a beach when his training ground was about 70 miles inland , i do n’t know			0
i will never forget there was a silence as we digested this brilliant insight			0
some years later , i heard it repeated in the company of no - nonsense manager @entity267			1
‘ the beach ? ’ he said			0
‘ in that case , why are n’t @entity270 , @entity272 and f * * * * * g @entity275 top of the league ? ’ they had no answer to that			0
@entity280 ( right , playing against @entity259 ) was a maverick while playing for @entity282 @entity280 undermined city manager @entity283 by calling the rookie ' f * * * * * * useless ' @entity286 ( centre ) only earned two @entity200 caps despite being one of the top players in the country the rest of @entity293 was moving towards total football , and we were going into an era when we stopped trusting our most skilful players			0
@entity286 ( two caps ) , @entity299 ( 17 caps ) , @entity301 ( five caps ) , @entity280 ( nine caps ) , @entity304 ( four caps ) — @entity200 had players that , technically , could have made any team in the world			0
we just did n’t pick them			0
i can not think of a bigger waste of talent in @entity11 football than @entity286 ’s two caps or @entity304 ’s four			0
players like @entity286 and @entity280 were brilliant , but mavericks			0
when full back @entity283 took over at @entity282 , @entity280 was in open rebellion			0
it got back to @entity319 that @entity280 had described him as f * * * * * g useless			0
‘ if you think i ’m f * * * * * g useless , this is never going to work			0
do you want to take it back ? ’ book said			1
‘ actually , ’ @entity280 replied , unrepentant , ‘ i do n’t think you ’re as good as that			0
