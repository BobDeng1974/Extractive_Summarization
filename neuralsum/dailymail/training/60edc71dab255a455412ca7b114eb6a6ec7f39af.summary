by @entity0 published : 11:44 est , 5 november 2012 updated : 09:57 est , 6 november 2012 mystery : a researcher at an ancient monastic site in @entity4 has found this man , who died 750 years ago , was probably murdered with a single sword blow call in the @entity8 team - a 750 - year - old murder has been unearthed at an ancient monastic site in @entity4			1
skeletal remains of a 13th century knight buried at @entity13 show that he died after being slashed by a sword			1
the mystery man , who lies in a grand stone tomb at the site , had been examined before and was believed to have died naturally			2
@entity18 from the @entity19 says that several vertebrae were severed , which may have caused damage to connecting muscles and nerves			1
by examining the skeleton , @entity25 researcher @entity24 discovered the injury , which would have left him alive for several hours , stricken and unable to walk , before a very painful death			0
a battlefield injury might be expected for a knight of this period but @entity35 weapons expert and tv presenter @entity33 suggests a more sinister incident			0
he said : ' it seems almost inconceivable that a wound of this nature could be caused to anyone wearing armour			2
the slice would have had to cut through the armour for the entire length of the wound			0
' this is not possible which suggests this wound was not received in battle			0
the possible scenarios that first occur to me are : assault by robbers or caught out , unarmoured , in an attack on his home or a private affray or murder			0
' it seems a tragic end for a man who was evidently an important man and great benefactor of @entity13			1
buried in a stone coffin with a lid bearing two carved shields that once would have borne his heraldic device , he took pride of place in the nave of the @entity13 church			1
burial site : the undercroft of @entity13 is the 13th century knight 's final resting place - and he could be a man called @entity75 curator @entity76 said : ' one character stands out as a strong possibility for being the occupant of this prestigious grave			1
' that is @entity75 , son of @entity82			0
we know he was born about ad 1170 and from skeletal evidence that he was 48 or over when he died			2
' whoever this poor man was , his story is one of many at @entity13 which is the largest excavated monastic site in @entity90			1
a new research programme is hoped to reveal many more such stories			0
the skeleton is now back on display at @entity95 .			0

the man died in the 13th century and was buried at @entity13 in @entity4
a *savage* sword blow to the back sliced through vertebrae which would have caused fatal muscle and nerve damage
he is thought to have been a prominent *aristocrat* since he was buried in pride of place at the former @entity110 priory
