by @entity0 published : 00:22 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 01:31 est , 31 august 2012 persistent : meatball was caught rummaging in the same @entity3 garage three times a 400 - pound black bear named meatball has inspired his very own @entity7 following , after he fearlessly broke into the same @entity3 home three times to snack on his namesake treat			1
but it was on his third visit to the same @entity16 garage that he was captured and sent to the @entity17 in @entity18 , but not before he established himself as a bit of a social media guru			2
using the pen name ' @entity22 ' , he often shares his thoughts and adventures with his audience , posting such pearls of wisdom as , ' i 'm @entity29 ! ' the hilarious feed has amassed more than 28,000 followers , each eagerly awaiting whatever he thinks of next			2
front desk ? my jacuzzi seems to be malfunctioning			0
someone left a lot of hair in it			0
please have housekeeping up right away ! ' he shares			0
mr @entity22 is surely enjoying his stay at the sanctuary , but before long he 'll be taken to his permanent home , the @entity43 in @entity44			1
' i hope this isnt one of those timeshare scams ... wan na move out to @entity44 with me ? i 'll let you have the top bunk ! ' he joked			0
still another tweet goes as follows : ' after all these tranquilizer shots , they may need to drop me off at @entity54 ... ' but unlike the @entity56 , who is yet to be unmasked , there is no mystery who is behind @entity22			0
words of wisdom : meatball often muses on his day to day @entity64 : meatball , tweeting under the handle ' @entity65 ' had posted close to 2,500 times as of aug. 31 , 2012 ' he needs a place where he â€¦ can have all the food and facilities for him to have a happy life , ' @entity69 , 29 , told the @entity75			1
@entity69 , who has proved an ambitious sort , has not only taken to @entity7 to give voice to @entity67 , but is hawking t - shirts and buttons on a webpage dedicated to the meandering bear			1
but it 's her @entity7 feed that had become her bread - and - butter			1
' this dude 's my hero ! ... @entity87 , ' @entity22 once tweeted			2
' shake ! shake ! shake ! mmmm ... shake'n bake = ) ' of late , @entity67 was taken to the rescue facility , @entity90 , in @entity18			0
it is there that she 'll reportedly stay before being ultimately taken to his permanent home , the @entity43 in @entity44 despite its success , the stunt , however , is lacking a bit in originality			2
a still - anonymous @entity56 humorously captivated the nation more than a year ago when he assumed the digital identity of a cobra who absconded from his captors at @entity105			0
that @entity7 feed - @ @entity107 - is still alive and going with the latest tweet from the cobra , which has been caught , posted aug. 26			1
but miss @entity69 has proved far more prolific , posting more than 2,500 times			1
' can i just stay in the tub all day ? ' the @entity113 captured , @entity114 to ' @entity115 for @entity116 , '' reads one of them			0
unmasked : unlike @entity120 , @entity22 's identity is not in question " meatball " the bear captured			1

meatball the bear was caught *raiding* the same @entity3 home three times for his namesake snack , but now he 's *headed* for an **animal** sanctuary
an *honorary* @entity7 handle , *helmed* by @entity69 , 29 , hopes to raise awareness about the **animal** and help him on his way
