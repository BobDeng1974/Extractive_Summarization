wearing a white t - shirt and white jogging bottoms , @entity2 , whose address in court was given as @entity72 , @entity44 , @entity33 , but who also rents an apartment at @entity75 in @entity76 , sat in the dock listening during the hour - long hearing			2

location : a @entity109 street view of @entity64 in @entity66 scene : one @entity111 in @entity33 , the bar where @entity2 is alleged to have assaulted his ex girlfriend @entity114 : @entity13 ' and @entity115 , where @entity2 was refused bail transport : the van that took @entity2 to court is pictured leaving flashes : @entity2 has shown glimpses of his talent at @entity3 but has struggled for consistency representing : @entity2 won four caps for @entity127 's under 21 side , scoring two goals in the process promise : @entity2 was at the @entity54 academy but left the club in 2012 to join @entity3 despite being touted as a bright prospect at @entity134 , @entity2 only appeared in the @entity135 before @entity105 took the decision to allow him to leave			1
@entity3 boss @entity137 took him to @entity138 but he was soon shipped out to @entity106 on loan , a move that the 59 - year - old felt helped @entity2 develop his attitude			1
upon his return to @entity138 , @entity2 established himself in the @entity3 first team and was one of their better performers in the early stages of last season			1
he scored a memorable goal in a 3 - 0 win at @entity152 which was voted as goal of the season by @entity3 ' fans before a niggling groin injury and a drop in form saw him lose his place in @entity137 's side			2
@entity2 picked up the first of his four @entity127 under 21 caps in a 4 - 0 win over @entity163 in october and was subject to a bid from @entity165 in january - although the offer was rejected			0

his long - term future at @entity3 has again been questioned after the club 's co-chairman @entity182 suggested @entity137 was not keen on keeping @entity2 in his squad - even though the board wanted to offer the midfielder a new deal			1
but @entity137 came out on wednesday to back @entity2 , if he can prove he wants to make it at the club			2
' we thought we 'd brought @entity2 to the forefront of his abilities this time last year , ' @entity137 told @entity194			0
' he had a fantastic pre-season and he started the season exceptionally well			0
i think that drifted away somewhat and he ended up with @entity29 on loan and ended up helping get them promoted			0
