monsoon - like conditions forced the abandonment of sunday 's @entity3 match between the @entity4 and @entity5 - a decision that could have implications on the title race			1
after torrential rain had left the @entity12 pitch covered in large puddles , making even short passes difficult , referee @entity9 decided to bring things to a premature conclusion on 73 minutes			2
league leaders @entity5 were leading 2 - 1 at the time and move four points clear at the top of the table because the result was allowed to stand			1
@entity4 's @entity23 and @entity25 's @entity24 struggle in atrocious conditions as torrential rain left the @entity12 pitch unplayable and forced an abandonment after 73 minutes @entity30 takes a tumble to the waterlogged surface under pressure from @entity25 's @entity34 referee @entity9 explains his decision to abandon the contest to @entity38 player @entity37 the officials explain their decision to call off the game with 17 minutes remaining but @entity4 coach @entity42 reacted angrily to the decision to call off the match despite the wild weather turning proceedings into a farce			1
@entity48 are in contention for the play - offs and @entity42 criticised the rule that states a replay is required if the match is abandoned before half - time but the result stands if it ends after the break			2
he said : ' of course i 'm disappointed because this is a crazy end			0
' i 've never seen this , because the choice is replay if it happens in the first - half , they 're the normal rules , and if it happens in the second - half you have to play the second - half again			0
@entity4 players protest the referee 's decision , having been 2 - 1 down at the time @entity48 's @entity23 attempts to get a shot away on the deteriorating surface @entity25 's @entity71 ( left ) and @entity48 's @entity72 splash through the puddles ' we all want an honest competition and @entity77 and @entity78 , they 're not happy with this because they are in a competition to be champions			1
' and we 're in a competition to be in the play - offs , so of course it 's disappointing			0
' when we had a free - kick in a dangerous position where we could score , they just call off the game and they give three points to one team and no points to the other team , that 's not an honest competition			0
' @entity48 led after five minutes through @entity23 before @entity96 equalised for the visitors 10 minutes later			0
then , moments before the half - time whistle , @entity99 international @entity98 pounced to put @entity25 ahead			2
they are now four points ahead of @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 , who are all tied on 38 points in second place			0
@entity25 's @entity99 international @entity98 had fired his side into the lead shortly before half - time @entity96 ( second left ) of the @entity5 celebrates with his team - mates after scoring the leveller @entity23 ( left ) had given play - off chasing @entity48 an early advantage at @entity12 how the @entity3 standings look after the weekend 's action			1
