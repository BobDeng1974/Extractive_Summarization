by @entity0 and @entity1 an @entity3 woman convicted of bludgeoning her husband to death with a hammer made a tearful plea for mercy thursday , telling the jury deciding her fate that she is sorry for her actions and wishes she could go back and undo the pain she caused			1
@entity13 , 36 , broke down in tears and repeatedly lost her composure as she spoke to the jury in the penalty phase of her trial			1
the same jury that convicted her of first - degree murder is deciding whether she should get the death penalty or a life sentence			1
' i do n't know if i can be useful to anybody in this world or in any way ... but i would like the opportunity to try , ' she said			0
fighting for her life : @entity13 had an emotional day in court thursday as she tried to convince a jury to spare her the death sentence for killing her husband murdered : @entity13 was found guilty last week of brutally beating her husband @entity31 ( pictured ) to death in 2009 , while trying to repay $ 300,000 in loans to her ' sugar - daddy ' boyfriend @entity13 was found guilty last week in the killing of @entity31 , who suffered multiple skull fractures in the january 2009 attack in the couple 's home in the @entity42 suburb of @entity43			1
the penalty phase began this week and featured emotional testimony from @entity13 's daughters a day earlier			1
@entity13 clasped a tissue , removed her glasses , took deep breaths and fought back tears for more than 10 minutes			2
she expressed regret for inflicting pain on her daughters , saying ' this goes into generations that do n't even exist yet			0
' ' i ca n't do anything more than say i 'm sorry			0
i ca n't push the back button			0
i ca n't bring him back			0
i ca n't fix everything that was wrong , ' she said			0
she also looked ahead to prison and hoped that she could ' talk to someone ' and help them make a better choice			0
prosecutors say she killed her husband in a failed bid to collect on a life insurance policy to repay more than $ 300,000 in loans from her boyfriend , a man 20 years her senior she met on a sugar - daddy website			2
@entity13 said she killed @entity31 in self - defense and told investigators he had physically and sexually abused her in the past			2

â € ˜ i saw a hammer go into @entity86 € ™ s head , â € ™ she says with a nervous smile			0
disturbing : @entity13 is seen smiling while demonstrating for investigators just hours after the attack how the hammer ( right ) entered her husband 's skull she would become the third woman on @entity3 's death row if the jury opts for the death penalty			1
the case had similar circumstances as the @entity100 trial that played out in @entity42 one year ago , including a brutal killing of a lover , claims of self - defense and salacious elements such as @entity13 's one - time job as a stripper			1
and the similarities between the two women do not end there : the cases were tried in the same @entity113 courtroom , and both @entity114 and @entity13 could face the death penalty			2
end of the road : @entity13 looked hopeless in court on april 8 as she was found guilty of killing her husband with their long dark hair and eyeglasses , the two women even look strangely alike			1
it has been reported that the 36 - year - old @entity13 befriended the 33 - year - old convicted killer while the two were in jail together			1
but the judge in this case made extensive efforts to keep the trial from becoming the spectacle that enveloped the @entity114 case			0
key witness : businessman @entity131 , who was @entity13 's boyfriend , testified for the prosecution against the woman who owed him $ 300,000			2

@entity13 , 36 , was convicted earlier this month of first - degree murder in *connection* to her husband 's 2009 killing
on thursday , a tearful @entity13 begged the jury to spare her the death sentence as they decide whether to exact *capital* punishment or life in jail
