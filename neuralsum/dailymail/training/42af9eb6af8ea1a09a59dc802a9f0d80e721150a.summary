' what a real mum looks like ' : @entity2 cradles her post-baby bump as she and @entity4 show off their newborn son outside @entity8 's hospital yesterday her hair was perfectly styled , thanks to the attentions of her personal stylist			1
she had applied her customary black eyeliner , her cheeks glowed with good health – and her smile threatened to outshine the hundreds of flashbulbs on the pavement outside			1
but for the mothers watching around the world as the @entity22 walked out on to the steps of the @entity24 yesterday , the real delight was her ‘ mummy tummy ’			1
that neat bump was the only thing which gave away the fact @entity2 had given birth to an 8lb 6oz boy just a day earlier			1
and the glowing duchess clearly felt no need to hide it , a decision praised immediately by mothers ’ groups			1
@entity37 founder @entity36 said the duchess had dispelled the ‘ myth that all mothers should be perfect postpartum ’			1
‘ in a couple of minutes on the steps of the @entity2 has done more for new mums ’ self - esteem than any other role model , ’ she said			2
‘ sadly , too many celebrities often have ultra-fast tummy tucks or strap themselves down to emerge in tiny size six jeans , leaving everyone else feeling inadequate			0
‘ @entity2 shows what a real mum looks like – and natural is beautiful			2
’ she continued : ‘ undoubtedly over the coming weeks the duchess will work hard to regain her figure , but tonight she ’s proved herself a healthy role model for real mums around the world			0
’ many mothers took to @entity61 to share their delight , describing @entity2 as a ‘ role model ’ for showing off her mummy tummy			1
one user wrote : ‘ oh just so lovely … i think she is fantastically brave to not hide her post birth shape			2
what a great role model she is			0
’ a second wrote : ‘ i loved that @entity2 did n’t hide her remaining bump			1
that is what a postnatal woman looks like folks ! ’ another added : ‘ they both looked fab , and i was also impressed that she did n’t hide the belly , good for her ! ’ a fourth wrote : ‘ i ’ve got tears in my eyes here			2
so glad @entity2 did n’t try to hide her bump like so many celebrities do			1
‘ i think my own squishy belly was the first immediately post-natal one i ’d ever seen			0
well done @entity2 ! ’ a neat bump : mothers ' groups were delighted at the @entity22 's decision not to hide her bump , with @entity37 ' founder @entity36 saying she had dispelled the ' myth that all mothers should be perfect postpartum ' the sight of @entity2 still carrying a bump after childbirth will have gladdened the hearts of new mums under pressure to regain their figure			1
it takes around ten days for the womb to contract back to its normal size , and the @entity22 looks ‘ completely normal ’ , according to @entity104 , a child care expert			2
providing there is not excessive weight gain , most of the pounds gained during pregnancy disappear with the arrival of the baby			0
the shedding of the placenta – the baby ’s life support and nutritional system in the womb – and amniotic fluid also help the body regain its shape			0
breastfeeding further helps weight loss and assists the womb to contract more quickly			0
miss @entity104 advised new mothers to relax and enjoy their baby			0
‘ the weight will , in most cases , take care of itself , ’ she said			0
@entity129 was also dominated by women praising @entity2 for refusing to hide her figure			1
@entity132 said : ‘ @entity133 to see @entity2 still has a mummy tummy ! not like these skinny celebs who come out stick thin			2
’ @entity137 wrote : ‘ beautiful royal baby and lovely to see that @entity2 still has a mummy tummy like all us normal women … i ’m still trying to lose mine ! ’ indeed , the general agreement last night was that the @entity22 looked ‘ utterly fabulous ’ as she presented her new son to the world			1
@entity2 , whose style over the last nine months has already become a by - word for pregnancy chic , did not disappoint with her choice of dress			2
her bespoke blue polka - dot @entity151 frock looked cool and chic , its empire line cut perfectly displaying her ‘ mummy tummy ’			0
her choice of print seemed to be a nod to the dress worn by @entity159 on the day she left hospital with prince @entity4 in 1982			0
she posed on the same steps with her first - born son , wearing a green polka dot dress			0
' utterly fabulous ' : women writing on @entity129 also hailed the duchess for her choice of dress which revealed the bump a nod to @entity159 ? the @entity170 posed on the same steps with her first - born son , @entity2 's husband prince @entity4 wearing a green dress with similar polka dots to the one worn by @entity2 yesterday but where @entity159 appeared nervous and bewildered by the attention – and was said to have burst into tears as soon as she got in the car – the radiant duchess smiled broadly and spoke assuredly to the ranks of camera crews			1
and while @entity180 wore a formal pinstripe suit and tie , @entity4 opted for a casual shirt , the blue perfectly matching his wife ’s dress			0
and , naturally for this very hands - on new father , the sleeves were rolled up .			0
