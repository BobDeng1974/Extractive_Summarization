by @entity0 an enterprising pair of best friends are launching a range of high - quality unisex watches priced at $ 95 , in hopes of taking on the luxury market			1
@entity7 , a recent @entity9 graduate from the @entity10 , and his childhood friend @entity11 , both based in @entity13 , had the idea to design their own watches after a frustrating hunt through an industry in which they found it standard for retailers and middle - men to mark watches up by 1,000per cent			0
' we started @entity25 to create a new way to buy a luxury watch , ' the company writes on its @entity29 page , which has already raised $ 231,000 in launch funding			1
' we want to offer meticulously crafted , handmade luxury watches at a radical price point			1
' time for a new standard : entrepreneurs @entity7 and his best friend @entity11 have launched @entity25 , a line of high - end quality watches priced at a reasonable $ 95 each ( pictured ) according to @entity38 , the founder duo were originally both on the lookout for their own ' first entry - level high - quality watch , ' something in the region of $ 500 to $ , 1000 ; from mid-range luxury brands including @entity45 or @entity46			1
' we saw a wide disparity in pricing , even for watches that had the same movement , the same components , ' reveals mr @entity7 ; pointing to brokers , middle - men and high - end retailers as those responsible for the heavy markups			2
' the closer we got to the luxury watch industry , the more we were turned off by what we were learning			0
' spot the difference : as a point of comparison , a mid-range luxury @entity45 watch for $ 450 ( left ) @entity25 's $ 95 offering ( center ) and a @entity64 worth nearly $ 8,000 ( right ) affordably priced : @entity25 ( pictured , other watches from its 15 - piece range ) hope to stand out with timepieces that are of the same quality as luxury brands , but without the significant mark - ups clean design : the idea struck the founders while they were both on the lookout for their own ' first entry - level high - quality watch , ' something in the region of $ 500 to $ , 1000 , but were put off by the senseless pricing so the team hit the drawing board , and spent a year with high - ranking designers , manufacturers and key influencers , to arrive at a set of 15 watches priced at only $ 95 , that seek to change the face of the market			1
' we saw a wide disparity in pricing , even for watches that had the same movement , the same components ' and these founders may be fresh out of business school , but their partners are no novices			2
according to the company , one of the @entity25 manufacturers also produces a watch that president @entity105 wears in office			1
' no middle - men			0
no retail mark - ups			0
an obsessive focus on the details , ' their campaign reads			0
' we 're so confident in the quality of our timepieces we are offering a ten year limited warranty on all of our watches			0
' strong partners : one of the manufacturers that works with @entity25 also produces a watch worn by president @entity105			1
exactly which one is unclear , but it could be this $ 695 timepiece drawing board : the founders spent a year with high - ranking designers , manufacturers and key influencers , with the aim of ' meticulously ' perfecting their creations design tweaks : the eclectic range of watches are housed in surgical grade stainless steel cases , and are designed to be extremely thin yet durable ( pictured , a work in progress ) durable : they boast scratch - resistant sapphire crystal lenses , @entity140 movements , are water resistant up to 50 meters , and come with a ten - year guarantee the eclectic range of watches are housed in surgical grade stainless steel cases , designed to be extremely thin yet durable , boast scratch - resistant sapphire crystal lenses , @entity140 movements , and are water resistant up to 50 meters			2
variations in addition to the smart @entity148 include the classics ; available with leather , tweed or nylon - striped straps , as well as a black - faced option , and the @entity154 , which include a stainless steel strap option			0
' the closer we got to the luxury watch industry , the more we were turned off by what we were learning ' mr @entity7 is certainly passionate about his offerings , and based on the success of his @entity29 campaign - which aimed to raise $ 75,000 , but has raised over three times that amount with nine days left on the clock - @entity25 appear well on their way to becoming a storming success			1
the company remains committed to avoiding certain partnerships , and opening its own retail store for example , in order to keep their price point ' fairly consistent			0
' ' if you want to buy a @entity178 watch for $ 50,000 , if that item makes you feel good , that ’s great , ' mr @entity7 remarks			2
' but ... at a certain point , the watch is what the watch is , and all that premium , all that extra you ’re paying for , is the brand name			0

@entity25 hopes to change the way we buy luxury watches with its *transparent* pricing
one of its manufacturers also produces a watch worn by @entity105
the founders have raised over $ 231,000 on @entity29
