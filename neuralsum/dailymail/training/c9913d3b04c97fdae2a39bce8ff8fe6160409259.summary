plunging : @entity0 , pictured in 2004 , who is widely believed to be @entity2 's mistress			1
she revealed she has met a man whom she ' loves ' the glamorous young @entity5 gymnast at the centre of speculation over @entity2 ’s marriage breakdown has spoken of her longing to marry and have children			1
@entity0 , 30 , who was first named as the @entity13 president ’s mistress five years ago , revealed she has indeed met a man ‘ whom i love very much ’			1
‘ sometimes you feel yourself so happy that you even feel scared that you are so happy , ’ she said			2
miss @entity0 , a gold medal - winning rhythmic gymnast who is now an mp in mr @entity2 ’s @entity19 party , had denied a relationship			1
yet the speculation in @entity22 has continued unabated , with claims mr @entity2 , 60 , and miss @entity0 already have a secret family of one , two or even three children			1
the rumours coincided with the almost total eclipse of mr @entity2 ’s wife , @entity28 , 55			1
some reports have even suggested she now lives as a recluse in a monastery			2
the rumour mill intensified last week as mr @entity2 and his wife announced they are to divorce			1
despite denials from mr @entity2 ’s spokesman , many @entity13 believe it is only a matter of time before @entity39 is gradually unveiled at his side			1
marriage to mr @entity2 would enable her formally to take her place as @entity45 ’s youngest first lady since @entity46 , the ill - fated wife of the @entity48 ’s last royal monarch , @entity47 in revealing recent television interviews , she never once named mr @entity2			1
instead of denying a relationship , her mannerisms – coquettish laughter and hand nervously brushing through her hair – if anything suggested the opposite			2
she also made clear that marriage is definitely on her mind , that she has found her mr @entity59 and that she does not yet have children			0
‘ of course i want to get married , have my family			0
and children , ’ she told a group of young interviewers			2
asked who she wanted to marry , she giggled and replied : ‘ you know i ’ve never thought about it			2
but life is such a thing that			0
you live and everything is fine with you and then you see a person you like			2
everything about him you like			0
this will be the kind of person i will marry			1
’ had she met this person ? ‘ @entity82 ’			1
( laughing more and now beaming with happiness )			0
’ the young audience broke into applause , with few viewers not aware of the name no one appeared brave enough to mention			0
in fact , the interviewer on this occasion did bravely press her for the identity of her man			0
@entity95 more coquettish laughter and nervous fidgets with her hair before she replied : ‘ you ’ve managed to ask that question			0
’ she laughed again rather than answer it directly but promised he is ‘ a very good , excellent man who i love very much ’			0
mr @entity2 with miss @entity0 in 2001 : the gold medal - winning rhythmic gymnast , who is now an mp in mr @entity45 party , has denied a relationship			1
yet the speculation in @entity22 has continued unabated body language : the @entity13 president pictured last year with his wife @entity28 , 55 , who has almost totally disappeared from public life			1
some rumours suggest she has gone to live as a recluse in a monastery a stronger indication of the true situation may have been a tv hagiography devoted to @entity39 marking her 30th birthday last month on @entity45 ’s main channel – in which she was surprisingly candid on her personal dreams			1
asked about her desire for a family , she flashed her smile to the camera , saying emphatically : ‘ of course , i am dreaming about having children , it ’s true			0
‘ although the whole country – and perhaps now other countries too – write i ’ve already got two or three children			0
sadly , i do n’t have children yet			0
but , of course , i want to be a mother			0
still , i ’m not yet			0
’ in may 2009 a newspaper had claimed she had given birth to a boy during that month , not naming the father			0
@entity139 : miss @entity0 pictured competing for @entity45 at the @entity140 in @entity141			1
she took gold four years later in @entity143 her gymnastics coach @entity144 , the wife of billionaire @entity146 shareholder @entity145 , said at the time : ‘ when @entity0 finds the right time , she will say it herself			1
and i ’m just happy for her			0
’ whispers of one or two other children have surfaced but no scrap of hard evidence has emerged from behind the well - guarded walls of mr @entity2 ’s palatial homes			1
miss @entity0 is an accomplished athlete , one of the most decorated gymnasts in the world , taking gold at the @entity160			2
as an mp now , she is dogged in pursuing mr @entity2 ’s agenda but also has a law to her name designed to protect the privacy of children			1
some observers have noticed a strange irony in the @entity170 whispers and denials appearing in the media			0
in spring 2008 , a newspaper called @entity174 first published the story that mr @entity2 had divorced @entity28 and was to marry @entity39 that june			1
it was the first time the subject had come to public attention			0
the owner of the paper , @entity179 , once a @entity181 colleague of @entity2 ’s who later bought the @entity182 and the @entity184 titles , insisted he knew nothing of the report ahead of publication as he had been away on a fishing trip and incommunicado			2
the editor resigned , though others at the paper insisted : ‘ we had information , and we reported it			0
’ within days , mr @entity179 had closed down the paper			0
he is now on trial in @entity22 – and facing up to five years in jail after a fracas in a tv studio when he punched fellow businessman @entity200			2
mr @entity179 said he felt ‘ half rehabilitated ’ over the divorce announcement			2
but if he is jailed , he may rue that fishing trip which meant his newspaper was the first to tell the world about miss @entity0 ’s supposed relationship with mr @entity2 .			1

@entity0 , 30 , told tv show she ' has met the person she will marry '
the former @entity5 gymnast is an mp in @entity2 's @entity19 party
her comments come as the @entity13 president announced his divorce
there have for years been rumours of an affair between him and @entity0
