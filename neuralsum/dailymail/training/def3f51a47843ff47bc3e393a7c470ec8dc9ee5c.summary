a text message from mr standing saying ' hope your nails look nice ' , was found on the 19 - year - old 's phone just yards away from the car , the inquest heard			1
the inquest in @entity29 , @entity14 , heard how @entity30 had been at her boyfriend 's family home for his mother ’s birthday celebration and had been planning a holiday with him			1
however , the pair then allegedly had an argument after she told him about plans to meet up with friend @entity40 , to get her nails done			1
when she left the house , @entity30 then sent a text to her friend asked her to ignore any messages mr @entity17 sent her			1
the crash happened a short time later after @entity30 pulled away from a set of traffic lights			2
her car veered off the road and hit a tree side - on with such force that the two sides of the vehicle were almost touching			1
the fuel lines then ruptured and the leaking petrol caught fire			2
@entity56 told the inquest she had arranged to meet @entity1 in @entity58 , @entity59 , at 4pm on july 24 last year			1
she said : ' then i spoke to her and she said she could n’t because there was no point coming over because he was having a go at her about leaving so early			2
' i ’m not sure if it was about the holiday			2
i think it was about her not being at his house for a long period of time			0
' @entity56 said they could go for a drink later on but whenever she tried to call @entity1 after that the phone would be put down			1
relationship : @entity17 ( left ) , miss @entity1 ' boyfriend , denied the pair had a row and had sent her a text message saying ' i hope the nails look nice ' minutes before the crash when asked by coroner @entity83 if the pair had argued , mr @entity17 denied the accusation			1
mr @entity83 said : ' you say you had a lovely day together and had no arguments			0
' the evidence we will hear of phone calls and text messages was that you had a bit of a disagreement about the holiday that day			0
' miss @entity1 ' boyfriend replied : ' not that i know of			1
we joked about how many camels we could sell each other for , just joking around			0
' the coroner asked again : ' but you do n’t remember having an argument about her having her nails done that day ? ' ' no , ' said the witness			2
mr @entity83 then said : ' the police log shows a text message to @entity40 earlier in the day , at nearly 1pm , saying : " @entity17 has got the major hump with me " , adding that just before her crash @entity1 had texted @entity40 to say : " if @entity113 messages , you will ignore it "			1
' safe driver : mr @entity17 told the inquest he had never seen his girlfriend use her phone while she was behind the wheel before the incident the last message was sent at 4.02pm			1
by 4.05pm her car was burning and other drivers were calling the emergency services			0
@entity126 was driving on the road at the time and told the inquest that after leaving some traffic lights she had seen a car some distance ahead , which she later discovered to be @entity30 , and that they had both , in turn , been overtaken by an @entity137 travelling at speed			0
' i remember it going past me quite fast			0
i saw it pass @entity1 ’s car way ahead , ' she said			1
' i must have looked away and the next thing i ’m level with her car which is in the trees , on fire			0
' she dialled 999 to report the incident and was told not to approach the stricken vehicle			2
@entity150 then arrived in his jeep and together with a trucker and other drivers they tried to get into the @entity154			0
he said : ' initially i could n’t see fire underneath the car			0
the fire was on the verge but certainly by the time i had got to it , it ( the fire ) had tracked to the car			0
' i tried to hit the window			0
i could n’t really see if there was anybody in there or not			0
somebody else came round the bank and said yes , there ’s somebody in it			0
he said he realised he had to try to help but he was only dressed in a tee - shirt and shorts and by that point the fire was ' too powerful , unbelievable '			0
support : @entity1 's mother @entity176 and friends comfort each other outside the hearing today at @entity29 , @entity14 both mr @entity17 and @entity56 told the inquest they had never seen @entity30 use her phone while driving , either for text messages or phone calls			1
her friend described her as a ' very sensible ' driver			2
pc @entity187 , a forensic collision investigator for @entity188 , said the very heavy impact with the tree had led to a v - shape indentation in the passenger side , of 80 to 90 per cent of the body ’s width			2
the only tyre to survive the crash and fire was just over half the recommended inflation pressure but the officer said he could not rule out if this was as a result of the force of the crash			0
he concluded @entity1 had lost control exiting a sweeping right - hand bend while travelling at about the 70mph speed limit			1
she had attempted to correct the steering and spun off the road			0
a pathologist concluded the young driver , from @entity211 , @entity59 , had died of extensive burn injuries			2
mr @entity83 , the assistant coroner for @entity14 , said at the hearing in @entity29 , @entity14 : ' we can not be absolutely sure of the precise reason why she left the road			1
' i do accept the evidence given by mr @entity17 and @entity56 that @entity1 was a sensible driver and there ’s no evidence to suggest that she texted or telephoned or answered a call on her phone while she was driving at speed			1
' i think the inference was the text was sent while she was waiting at the traffic lights and did n’t contribute to her leaving the road			0
' he recorded a verdict of accidental death .			0
