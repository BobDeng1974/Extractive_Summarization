@entity0 has given a rare glimpse inside the vast data centres around the globe that power its services			1
they reveal an intricate maze of computers that process internet search requests , show @entity10 video clips and distribute email for millions of people			0
with hundreds of thousands of servers , colourful cables and even bicycles so engineers can get around quickly , they range from a converted paper mill in @entity19 to custom made server farms in @entity21			1
' very few people have stepped inside @entity0 ’s data centers , and for good reason : our first priority is the privacy and security of your data , and we go to great lengths to protect it , keeping our sites under close guard , ' the firm said			1
' while we ’ve shared many of our designs and best practices , and we ’ve been publishing our efficiency data since 2008 , only a small set of employees have access to the server floor itself			0
' today , for the first time , you can see inside our data centers and pay them a virtual visit			0
' on where the @entity66 lives , our new site featuring beautiful photographs by @entity64 , you ’ll get a never - before - seen look at the technology , the people and the places that keep @entity0 running			2
' the site features photos from inside some of the eight data centers that @entity0 already has running in the @entity76 , @entity19 and @entity77			1
@entity0 is also building data centers in @entity32 , @entity34 , @entity33 and @entity31			1
virtual tours of a @entity81 data center also will be available through @entity0 's ' @entity83 ' service , which is usually used to view photos of neighborhoods around the world			1
the photographic access to @entity0 's data centers coincides with the publication of a @entity91 article about how the company builds and operates them			1
the article is written by @entity95 , a journalist who won @entity0 's trust while writing ' in @entity97 , ' a book published last year about the company 's philosophy and evolution			2
one of @entity0 's server farms in @entity102 , @entity21 , which provides over 115,000 square feet of space for servers running services like @entity106 and @entity10 @entity0 colour codes its servers depending on their location , while piping in the buildings is coded depending on what it carries - with cool water in blue tubes and warm in red @entity0 's @entity116 data centre in @entity117 is so large the firm provides @entity0 branded bicycles for staff to get around on a street view tour published by @entity0 also reveals a hidden surprise - a @entity122 standing guard over a server in @entity0 's @entity81 server farm the data centers represent @entity0 's nerve center , although none are located near the company 's headquarters in @entity131 , @entity132 as @entity0 blossomed from its roots in a @entity139 garage , company co-founders @entity133 and @entity136 worked with other engineers to develop a system to connect low - cost computer servers in a way that would help them realize their ambition to provide a digital roadmap to all of the world 's information			1
initially , @entity0 just wanted enough computing power to index all the websites on the @entity66 and deliver quick responses to search requests			2
as @entity0 's tentacles extended into other markets , the company had to keep adding more computers to store videos , photos , email and information about their users ' preferences			0
the insights that @entity0 gathers about the more than 1 billion people that use its services has made the company a frequent target of privacy complaints around the world			0
the latest missive came tuesday in @entity171 , where regulators told @entity0 to revise a 7 - month - old change to its privacy policy that enables the company to combine user data collected from its different services			2
@entity0 studies internet search requests and web surfing habits in an effort to gain a better understanding of what people like			0
the company does this in an effort to show ads of products and services to the people most likely to be interested in buying them			0
advertising accounts for virtually all of @entity0 's revenue , which totaled nearly $ 23 billion through the first half of this year			0
even as it allows anyone with a web browser to peer into its data centers , @entity0 intends to closely guard physical access to its buildings			1
the company also remains cagey about how many computers are in its data centers , saying only that they house hundreds of thousands of machines to run @entity0 's services			2
@entity0 's need for so many computers has turned the company a major electricity user , although management says it 's constantly looking for ways to reduce power consumption to protect the environment and lower its expenses			0
here hundreds of fans funnel hot air from the server racks into a cooling unit to be recirculated in @entity217			0
the green lights are the server status @entity219 reflecting from the front of the servers the @entity21 campus network room , where routers and switches allow data centers to talk to each other			2
the fiber cables run along the yellow cable trays near the ceiling			0
even the water pipes reflect @entity0 's brand : these colorful pipes are responsible for carrying water in and out of an @entity236 data center			2
the blue pipes supply cold water and the red pipes return the warm water back to be cooled			0
in @entity241 , @entity19 , @entity0 chose to renovate an old paper mill to take advantage of the building 's infrastructure as well as its proximity to the @entity19 's cooling waters			1
@entity0 's server farm in @entity116 , @entity21 the exterior of a @entity250 , @entity236 server farm @entity252 , a @entity0 engineer , diagnoses an overheated cpu			1
for more than a decade , @entity0 has built some of the world 's most efficient servers			0
a @entity0 data center in @entity102 , @entity21			1
each server rack has four switches , connected by a different coloured cable			0
colours are kept the same throughout data centres so staff know which one to replace in case of failure .			1

data centres range from vast *warehouses* in @entity21 to a converted paper mill in @entity19
buildings are so large @entity0 even provides bicycles for engineers to get around them
