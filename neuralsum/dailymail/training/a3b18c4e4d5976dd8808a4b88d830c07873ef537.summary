by @entity0 published : 10:17 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 01:46 est , 7 june 2013 a £ 1.75billion @entity3 submarine project has run aground after officials realised that the vessel is more than 70 tonnes too heavy - because an engineer put a decimal point in the wrong place			1
a former @entity3 official has described the mistake , which has led to fears that the submarine might not resurface if sent to sea , as ' fatal '			1
the @entity14 , the first in a new class of diesel electric submarines , was almost complete when the problem was noticed			2
too heavy : the @entity14 , a new , @entity3 - designed submarine is more than 70 tons too heavy , and officials fear if it goes out to sea , it will not be able to surface			1
officials are pictured next to the engine of the vessel last november @entity3 will now pay @entity26 contractor @entity25 £ 9million over three years to assess the issue and carry out the work required to correct it , according to the @entity29			1
@entity30 , former director of the @entity31 at @entity3 's @entity32 said that officials will review options suggested by @entity25			1
but he said the preference has been to extend the length of the submarine ’s hull , perhaps by 5 to 6 meters , to increase buoyancy			0
otherwise , the weight of the 2,200 tonne submarine would have to be reduced , and he said the @entity41 would not want to compromise features such as the combat system or an air - independent propulsion system			0
experts : @entity25 , the company who will help the @entity3 rectify the problem , helped to build the @entity49 attack submarine , pictured , for the @entity50 in 2003 @entity25 , the primary contractor for the @entity26 ’s fleet of nuclear submarines , accepted the contract through a foreign military sales agreement between the @entity26 and the @entity58 , the @entity52 @entity51 announced this week			1
the submarine project has cost the @entity3 some £ 1.75billion so far			1
but what exactly are they getting for their money with the @entity64 submarine : @entity25 , a division of @entity65 , has helped other countries with their submarine programs			0
it began assisting with development of the @entity71 - class nuclear attack submarine for the @entity50 in 2003 , and it is working under another foreign military sales agreement on @entity75 ’s @entity74 class of submarines			0
the 233ft long submarine will carry a crew of 32 , along with eight special forces troops , and weapons systems for surface and anti-submarine warfare			2
the @entity32 said technical problems are normal for projects of this scale			0
it said in a statement : ' the technology challenges that these programs face during development are much more than simple calculations			0
' all the major military programs , especially submarines , have experienced delays and often have required the support of a technology partner			0
' mr @entity30 added : ' apparently somebody in the calculations made a mistake in the very beginning and nobody paid attention to review the calculations			2
' the @entity14 , named after a 19th century @entity3 submarine designer , is one of four vessels in the class that are in various stages of construction			1
the country has invested about £ 1.75billion in the program			0
the first vessel was scheduled to be delivered in 2015 but the @entity3 state - owned shipbuilder , @entity112 , has said the weight problems could cause delays of up to two years .			2

experts fear that the @entity14 will not surface again if sent to sea
the mistake will cost £ 9million over three years to rectify
a @entity52 company is to present a range of options to @entity3 officials
the project could be set back two years by the error
