but when it came to signing up for her latest film project - mobster movie @entity10 - the 39 - year - old has revealed that she approached the role with a rather unique mindset			1
' i wanted to play [ politician ] @entity15 , ' she told @entity16 about the movie , which sees her stepping into the shoes of @entity19 , the wife of an immigrant who sets out to build up his own business in @entity22 in the 1980s			1
