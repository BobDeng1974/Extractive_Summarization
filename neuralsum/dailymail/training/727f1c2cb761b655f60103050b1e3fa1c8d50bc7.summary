the problems began on saturday when a @entity46 - bound flight took off from @entity47 and a row of seats became unhinged			2
they slid around the cabin , forcing the plane to make an emergency landing at @entity55 's @entity54			1
a second plane was discovered to have loose seats on monday after taking off for @entity46 and was forced to return to @entity54			1
@entity58 left @entity54 at 7.11 am and returned to the gate around an hour later			0
after a delay of two hours , passengers continued on their journey			0
another plane flying from @entity47 to @entity46 on saturday diverted to @entity55 after seats loosened in mid-flight			2
remove and repair : seats on 35 of @entity1 ' @entity17 aircraft have been inspected and fixed , with another 11 to be checked @entity69 , a stock analyst from @entity47 who was on the flight , said the flight was delayed after boarding passengers noticed that the seats in one row were leaning against another			1
he said : ‘ when it comes to flying , i do n't like unexpected events			0
‘ i 'm 42 , i 've been flying more than 20 years , and i 've never seen where seats were n't screwed down			2
’ the debacles came as reports of smoke in a plane cabin forced an @entity1 flight from @entity85 to @entity86 to be diverted to @entity87 in @entity88 on tuesday			2
the airline blamed a faulty fan in an entertainment system for the smoke			2
the combination of the safety issues has raised questions about the safety of the airline with aviation industry experts claiming that bad publicity could lead passengers to avoid the carrier			0
@entity100 , president of the safety - advocacy group @entity101 , said passengers could be hurt or killed in an otherwise survivable crash if seats break loose from their moorings			1
he said : ‘ what if it 's a little kid or an old person in the row behind them ? ‘ that seat becomes a projectile with people on it			0
’ the planes in the saturday and monday incidents were serviced in the last two months , with the seats removed and reinstalled , @entity1 said			1
up to par : the airline 's parent @entity31 filed for bankruptcy protection in november and is now working with federal safety administrations to make sure all their planes are up to par mr @entity37 said new seats on some of the airline ’s 757s had different fastening systems that required precise positioning of the seats so they could lock into place			1
the new system holds seats in place using two bolts at the back that are tightened with wrenches and two in front that are tightened by hand			0
previously , the four bolts were all wrench - tightened			0
he said : ‘ it 's a very temperamental job			0
’ the work was done at the airline ’s base in @entity149 , @entity150 and a @entity42 facility in @entity152			0
airline spokeswoman @entity153 said in both cases the airline ’s employees were the last to touch the seats , a comment which drew a fierce response from the @entity160 which represents the airline ’s maintenance employees			1
@entity160 official @entity163 said : ‘ our workers were the last to touch the seats only in the sense that after the seats came loose we were dispatched ( to fix them )			2
’ the union blamed @entity42 and criticised management at the airline ’s parent company @entity31 for cutting costs by outsourcing maintenance work			1
fright : on saturday , a @entity46 - bound flight took off from @entity47 when the row of seats became unhinged and slid around the cabin , forcing the plane to make an emergency landing at @entity55 's @entity54 a @entity42 spokesman said the company is investigating the incidents			1
@entity1 and government officials say the safety issues were not related to other difficulties with union workers who are unhappy about pending layoffs and cuts to pay and benefits as it tries to turn around under bankruptcy protection			1
the delays and cancellations have annoyed passengers , but even the hint of mechanical issues could frighten them away and even threaten @entity13 's existence , experts said			0
@entity200 , an aviation consultant who once worked at @entity13 , said delays , cancellations and bad publicity about broken seats could create an opening for rivals @entity206 and @entity208 to poach @entity13 customers in competitive markets like @entity85 and @entity55			0

’ @entity213 , founder of travel website airfarewatchdog.com said : ' these things can kill an airline			0
