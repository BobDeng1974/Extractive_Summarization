two little black pigs brought drama to the coastal town of @entity7 after escaping from an allotment			1
police raced into action as traffic was held up by the runaway pair , and one was last night under arrest after being found rooting for food in a waste bin			1
pig hunt : two of the animals went on the run yesterday but this one was caught after it stopped to raid a bin for a bite to eat but its friend continued to show officers a clean pair of trotters and , as night fell , the trail was as cold as a frozen pork chop			1
the drama in @entity7 , six miles south of @entity33 , is reminiscent of the famous dash for freedom made by @entity36 – the @entity2 – in 1998			1
the story of the @entity2 was later made into a hour - long @entity39 television drama			1
they cheated the butcher ’s knife by going on the run from an abattoir , swimming the @entity45 and disappearing into a dense thicket			2
they were eventually caught but , thanks to the @entity49 , were given a reprieve from their death sentence and lived out their days in an animal sanctuary			0
all went quiet in the sphere of porcine escapology until wednesday evening , when the two black pigs – thought to be @entity57 crossbreeds – made a break from @entity59 in @entity7			1
one of the runaways was lassoed by 37 - year - old mother - of - three @entity61 , who found it in a back alley with its snout in an overflowing bin			1
she is keeping it on her own allotment until it can be reunited with its friend			0
piggy dinner : this little hog was nabbed on @entity73 but his friend from the allotments is still on the loose neighbourhood sergeant @entity77 of said : ' the owner of the pigs normally whistles at them to get them to come back			2
everyone is keeping an eye out for the one which is still missing			2
' police officers were alerted to the escapees after being called when one of the pigs was seen trotting along the @entity90 heading towards the @entity91 in the town			1
sightings of the new fugitives were reported on social networking sites as they caused mayhem around @entity7			1
@entity97 commented via @entity98 said : ' not every day you see a pig holding up the traffic lol			0
' safe : the captured pig , nicknamed @entity104 , is now being looked after back at the allotments but is missing his partner in crime helpers : @entity110 and decorator @entity109 lassoed @entity104 with the help of her son @entity112 , 11 munching : it was this pig 's prodigious appetite that caught up with it last night , and he is now being fed fresh fruit and vegetables among other delights after capturing one of the pigs , @entity119 tweeted : ' after struggling for 30 mins we caught the pig in @entity73 in @entity7			1
' miss @entity61 , who helped to catch one of the runaway pigs last night			2
the painter and decorator helped to lasso the pig in a back alley after it was cornered by police			2
' he was found in a back lane that was full of rubbish , ' she said			2
' he was scared when we found him , i tried to catch him but he scarpered down the alley			0
' i tried to lasso it once with a dog lead but it slipped away the first time and the second time i managed to loop it around it 's neck			0
' the pig has been nicknamed @entity104 by some , everyone 's talking about him			0
' idyllic : the seaside town of @entity7 is said to have been thrown into chaos by the fleeing pigs captured : the one pig intercepted was spotted trotting towards the @entity91 @entity109 kept the pig in her allotment where she keeps 14 chickens			1
she also owns two horses which are kept in stables , enjoying fresh food including carrots , apples , grass roots and some horse feed			0
' he 's having a good time digging up my vegetables and he 's being kept in the chicken shed for now			0
' apparently the other pig was seen near the allotments this morning , and he was caught but he got away before the officers came to rescue him			0
' it 's been quite exciting helping to catch them - we just want to reunite him with the other one - we do n't know if it 's his brother or not			0
' while the @entity182 took in the runaway pig , the other has still not yet been found			0
police were made aware of a sighting of the other pig at @entity7 around 11pm last night but when they attended , the pig could not be found			1
another sighting was reported at around 8am this morning , but again when officers arrived at the scene , the pig had once again escaped			0
@entity191 : this latest escape has reminded people of dynamic duo ' the @entity195 , left , and @entity196 , who went on the run from an abattoir neighbourhood sergeant @entity77 said : ' we had a call around 8pm last night to say that there was a pig on the loose			1
' it was running around the roads in @entity7			1
' two pcsos and response officers attended and they chased the pig into a back alley where the pig was detained			0
' that was it for about an hour until a second pig was reported to also be loose			0
' about 11pm last night there was a second call saying that a pig was running around @entity216 , @entity7			2
' however when officers searched the area , no pig was found			0
' another call came in around 8am this morning to say that a pig had been seen on @entity222 in @entity7			2
' a further area search revealed no signs of the pig , meaning there is still an animal on the loose			0

one was found munching on food from a bin but the other is still missing
police say the fugitive has been spotted but keeps fleeing the authorities
pair launched *daring* escape in @entity7 , @entity240
