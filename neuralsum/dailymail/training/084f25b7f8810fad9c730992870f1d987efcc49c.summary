but less than 100 years later the sun - scorched towns of @entity7 and nearby @entity7 in @entity10 's @entity9 desert lay abandoned , the ghost towns of a different age			1
@entity7 was established in 1862 and became the epicentre of @entity10 saltpeter , or sodium nitrate			1
this ' white gold ' was used in explosives and later , fertilisers , transforming farming practices in @entity20 and @entity21			0
the material was in demand for more than 50 years from the 1860s and northern @entity10 became the largest supplier of natural saltpeter in the world			1
200 plants sprang up to mine and process the nitrate as a result			2
ghost town : established in 1862 , @entity7 in northern @entity10 was the epicentre of saltpeter , or sodium nitrate , mining			1
but after the value of the material dropped , @entity7 's plants were closed down and its houses abandoned abandoned : a burst coffin containing human bones lies in the arid ground in @entity7			2
the old town lies in @entity10 's @entity9 desert , the driest on @entity46 eerie : crosses mark out graves in the cemetery of old mining town @entity51 about 118 miles north of @entity52			1
after its 19th - century heyday the town became a prison camp during the @entity57 regime where hundreds of political prisoners were brought to be tortured towns like @entity7 and @entity7 evolved around the plants , luring thousands of people to the driest desert on @entity46			1
in the 1940s , 3,700 people lived in @entity7			2
they enjoyed watching @entity66 films and @entity68 operettas - or zarzuelas - in the municipal theatre			0
now the building is a wreck , its once plush red velvet chairs in tatters from neglect			0
their are stories of ghosts : children 's screams echoing in the buildings and apparitions appearing in photographs			0
a mile down the road , @entity7 , established in 1872 , was a smaller plant with 450 families during the booming 1920s			0
but by the 1930s , a synthetic nitrate , developed in @entity21 , more or less wiped out the bustling industry			1
production fell to 10 per cent in @entity7 and by the 1950s it had nosedived to just 3 per cent			2
neighbours : a mile from @entity7 , @entity7 , established in 1872 , was a smaller mining plant with 450 families during the booming 1920s but closed up in 1958 no diving now : an abandoned swimming pool , daubed with graffiti , rusts away in @entity7 past joys : @entity7 's 3,700 inhabitants enjoyed watching @entity66 films and @entity68 operettas in the municipal theatre , now a wreck by 1959 the town 's mines and plants had closed			2
its workers left to find new jobs			0
the once thriving town became desolate , while people 's abandoned possessions lay decaying : dresses , shoes and fichas - tokens used instead of cash - are still gathering dust today			2
@entity7 was declared a national monument by the @entity121 government in 1970 and became a @entity122 in 2005			0
however , after years of earthquakes and vandalism , the town is now on the @entity126 in @entity127			0
similarly , @entity7 closed in 1958			0
@entity128 and a narrow - gauge railway , once used to transport the ' white gold ' to the coast , remain the only remnants of a golden age			0
more sinister still is @entity51 - or to use the literal @entity68 translation ' p * * swater ' on account of the water contaminated with nitric acid - a coastal town 118 miles north of @entity52			2
going nowhere : an old train stands abandoned on rusty tracks in @entity7			2
the town was declared a national monument by the @entity121 government in 1970 and became a @entity122 in 2005 decline : by the 1930s , a synthetic nitrate , developed in @entity21 , more or less wiped out the bustling industry			1
production fell to 10 per cent in @entity7 and by the 1950s it nosedived to just 3 per cent remnants : @entity128 , buildings and a narrow - gauge railway , once used to transport the ' white gold ' to the coast , remain the only remnants of a golden age in both @entity7 and @entity7 spooky : this room in a @entity7 house looks virtually untouched @entity128 and a narrow - gauge railway , once used to transport the ' white gold ' to the coast , remain the only remnants of @entity7 's golden age it had been a busy port for the mining companies , but after the value of saltpeter fell , the town became a prison camp during the @entity57 regime			1
hundreds of political prisoners were brought to @entity51 to be tortured			0
in 1990 , 20 bodies were exhumed from an unmarked grave in the town 's cemetery following the @entity176 investigation into the dictatorship			1
the corpses , which had been wrapped in cloth and bound with wire , showed obvious signs of torture			0
all had bullet holes , some still wore blindfolds and had their hands tied together			0
two were mutilated , one beheaded			0
now @entity51 's some 250 residents , scratching a living harvesting algae and shellfish , must live with the ghosts of their town 's past , while @entity7 and @entity7 continue to crumble			1
@entity7 had been a busy port for the mining companies , but after the value of saltpeter fell , the town became a prison camp during the @entity57 regime			1
here are a pile of shoes left behind a woman 's clothes are left as they were in an empty house years after the occupant left ready to leave : suitcases piled up in a house in @entity7 that were left behind @entity7 was declared a national monument by the @entity121 government in 1970 and became a @entity122 in 2005 @entity7 evolved around the saltpeter plants , luring thousands of people to the driest desert on @entity46			1
now it is a ghost town the once thriving town became desolate , while people 's abandoned possessions lay decaying : dresses , shoes and fichas - tokens used instead of cash - are still gathering dust map showing the deserted town of @entity7 in @entity10			1

@entity10 had been largest supplier of natural saltpeter - sodium nitrate - in the world
towns housing thousands of workers sprang up in @entity9 desert to cope with demand
but when synthetic nitrate was developed in 1930s , natural material 's value nosedived
@entity7 and @entity7 abandoned entirely by 1960
@entity51 became prison camp under @entity57 regime
*gruesome* discovery in 1990 of 20 bodies showing signs of torture put @entity51 on map for *macabre* reasons
now home to just 250 residents
