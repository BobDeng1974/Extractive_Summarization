by @entity1 reporter published : 19:37 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 20:06 est , 5 july 2013 back in the day : during a covert career in which he infiltrated various groups , @entity2 has spoke of his disgust at some of his actions a former @entity10 police officer who fathered a child with one of several targets he had relationships with while working undercover has apologised to the women			1
@entity2 said he would always regret the ' serious mistakes ' he made during a covert career which saw him use the identities of dead children , give evidence in court under his false name and co-author a libellous leaflet			1
mr @entity2 used the alias @entity28 during his five years infiltrating environmentalist groups , when he was with the special demonstration squad ( @entity31 ) , the @entity26 unit that targeted political activists			1
the revelation that the married officer slept with four women - fathering a child with one - sparked outrage			1
in an interview with @entity38 , he said he accepts his behaviour was morally reprehensible and a gross invasion of privacy			2
' with hindsight , i can only say that i genuinely regret my actions , and i apologise to the women affected , ' he said			2
' i 'd always been a faithful husband			0
i only ever became an unfaithful husband when i became an undercover police officer			2
' the ex-officer declined to reveal whether his superiors were aware of the child - insisting he would only discuss that with an investigation into the activities of undercover police activities being led by the chief constable of @entity55			1
mr @entity2 said he ' did n't really give pause for thought on the ethical considerations ' of adopting the identity of a dead child in 1984 as it was standard practice at the time			1
' that 's what was done			0
let 's be under no illusions about the extent to which that was an accepted practice that was well known at the highest levels of the @entity68 , ' he told the programme			0
he confirmed that he had appeared in court as @entity28 but could not say whether the judiciary was made aware by the police that he was doing so			1
' on occasions i was arrested as @entity28 and to maintain cover i went through the process of arrest , detention , and on occasions , appearing in court , ' he said			1
he denied it amounted to perjury as ' the position was that i was maintaining cover as @entity28 '			1
but asked if the court was ' made aware ' , he added : ' well , that 's what needs to be established			0
' mr @entity2 also confirmed that he helped write a libellous leaflet that attacked fast food giant @entity86 and triggered the longest civil trial in @entity90 history			1
@entity91 's famously sued two green campaigners over the leaflet in a landmark three - year high court case			1
it was not disclosed during the costly civil legal proceedings brought by @entity86 in the 1990s that an undercover police officer helped write the leaflet			2
' i was certainly a contributing author to the @entity102 leaflet			0
well , i think , the one that i remember , the one that i remember making a contribution to , was called what 's @entity107 with @entity86 ? ' , he told @entity38			0
over the line : @entity2 in a more recent picture , fathered a child with one of his targets asked if that fact was disclosed during the proceedings , he said : ' i do n't know			1
' he repeated his rejection though of claims that he planted an incendiary device in a @entity119 store in @entity120 in 1987 , calling that a ' false allegation '			2
mr @entity2 , who was an @entity31 manager for five years , earlier this week insisted he had not been aware of any campaign against the family of murdered black teenager @entity124			1
those claims were made by another veteran of the unit , @entity128 , who alleges he was told to find information to use to smear the @entity124 family - who are calling for a public inquiry to examine the issue			1
home secretary @entity134 has said they would be looked at by the @entity55 probe and a separate inquiry led by barrister @entity138 into alleged corruption in the original @entity124 murder investigation , but has left open the possibility of other action			0
' my reputation is never going to be redeemed for many people , and i do n't think it should be , ' mr @entity2 said			1
' i think i made serious mistakes that i should regret , and i always will do			0
i think the only real comfort i can take from my police career is that the @entity150 was about learning from mistakes			0
' @entity151 , one of eight women who are suing the @entity26 over relationships with men who turned out to be undercover officers , rejected his apology			2
' almost everything he said to me was a lie ; why would i possibly believe what he says to me know			0
' if it had n't been for the case we 're bringing against the police , he would never have apologised and i would have lived the rest of my days not finding out the truth			0
' former director of public prosecutions @entity171 said the latest evidence strengthened the case for a judge - led public inquiry			2
' it is as bad as i think we thought it was , ' he said			0
' he seems to have admitted a great deal of the conduct that people feared had been taking place			0
' it now sounds as though not only senior police officers but senior civil servants may have known what was going on			0
' it 's no good having this multitude of inquiries that are going on at the moment , one of them conducted by the police themselves which is pretty hopeless in my view			0
' we need a single public inquiry under a senior judicial figure to examine what happened , what went wrong , who authorised it and most of all to reassure us that its not going on still			0
