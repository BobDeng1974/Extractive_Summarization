at least that ’s the plan behind an ambitious project , dubbed ‘ @entity12 ’ , being developed by engineers in the @entity14			2
at this height the balloon will burst , a parachute will open and the cameras will drift back to @entity29 while filming ‘ only 530 people have ever travelled to space			1
well , lucky them ... but what about the rest of us ? ' , the group wrote on their @entity37 page			2
‘ this project is about enabling us , the remaining 99.999992 per cent , to get that experience			0
' the plan by the team at @entity43 sounds relatively simple : 24 @entity22 cameras will be attached to a balloon around 12.5 miles ( 20km ) into the air			1
the cameras will be encased in @entity47 alongside sensors , an sd card to store the video and a battery pack			2
if all goes to plan , at this height the balloon will burst , a parachute will open and the cameras will drift back to @entity29 while filming			1
cameras will be encased in @entity47 alongside sensors , an sd card to store the video and a battery pack during its third test flight in @entity63 earlier this year , @entity61 's @entity60 , pictured , reached a top speed of @entity65			2
this is approximately 767 mph at sea level , and helped the craft reach an altitude of 71,000ft above the @entity69 in @entity63 this will provide a 360 - degree video that can be viewed with @entity9 as if the user were in a vessel heading back down to @entity29			1
the software will allow anyone to speed up , slow down and reverse time , and even comes with its own musical soundtrack			0
lead researcher dr @entity78 from the @entity43 said : ‘ for this project the experience is everything , so we 're going with the cutting edge of available technology			1
’ the @entity9 , developed by @entity85 , is a virtual reality headset , which delivers a high definition @entity87 virtual environment for the user			0
versions of the software will also be available for smartphones and pcs , for those who do n’t have access to an @entity9			0
smartphone users will be able to look around by tilting their devices , while the experience on pcs will be controlled via mouse			0
the project is now on @entity37 where £ 40 ( $ 67 ) will secure you a ‘ ride ’ to space			1
the group hope to raise £ 30,000 ( $ 50,100 ) to get the project off the ground			0
the software for the @entity109 ( pictured ) will allow anyone to speed up , slow down and reverse time , and even comes with its own musical soundtrack an engineer at @entity43 demonstrates a version of the software which will also be available for smartphones have you ever wanted to see the world through your partner ’s eyes ? that 's the concept behind @entity123 ’s @entity122 experiment that uses @entity9 headsets to let wearers experience how other people see the world			1
through the use of the headset , and a series of first - person cameras , the system creates the illusion that partner a can see what is being recorded by the visor worn by partner b , and vice versa			0
one member of the couple is called the user , while the other is the performer			0
through the @entity9 goggles , the user is shown a video stream taken from the perspective of the performer 's eyes			1
each couple agrees on a set of synchronised movements and the partner 's mirror each others hand gestures , and so on , while wearing the headsets			0
by mimicking movements , it creates an illusion in the brain that what the performer is seeing , is actually being seen through the eyes of the user .			0

plan is to send 24 cameras attached to balloon 12.5 miles above @entity29
at this height balloon will burst and cameras will drift to @entity29 while filming
this will provide a 360 - degree video that can be viewed with an @entity9
the project by @entity43 is currently raising funds on @entity37
