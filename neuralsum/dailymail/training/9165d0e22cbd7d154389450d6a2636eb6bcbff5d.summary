by @entity0 published : 16:55 est , 18 may 2012 updated : 17:10 est , 18 may 2012 the war in @entity3 will end up costing taxpayers £ 20billion , it emerged last night			1
at a @entity6 summit in @entity7 , @entity8 and other world leaders will tomorrow draw up a firm timetable for pulling combat troops off the frontline against the @entity13			1
but official figures show that the war had already cost £ 17.3billion by the end of march this year on top of regular defence spending since 2001			1
about tiem : a firm timetable will be drawn up to withdraw troops from @entity3 - but it has already hit taxpayers hard the true cost of the war was revealed by the @entity23 and will be formally published by the @entity24 later this year			1
it puts @entity26 on course for a bill approaching £ 20billion by the time @entity26 troops hand over responsibility for combat operations in @entity33			1
a total of 414 @entity26 servicemen have lost their lives in the country , more than 20 of them at the hands of the @entity3 security forces they are supposed to be training to take over			1
the government has said @entity26 troops will have ended combat operations by the end of december 2014			1
but mr @entity8 has also signalled that a large number of troops will pull back from the frontline and begin coming home next year			2
[ caption @entity26 troop numbers will fall from 9,500 to 9,000 this year and that number is expected to halve during 2013			2
mr @entity8 will use the @entity6 summit to demand that other countries help shoulder some of the costs of the conflict as @entity57 military involvement winds down			1
in an article published yesterday , mr @entity8 said countries that had not sent troops should shoulder their share of costs since the world ’s leading economies had paid a disproportionate amount			1
‘ today the @entity66 accounts for four - fifths of the donor funding now going to the region , ’ he said			0
‘ we must encourage other countries to step up and contribute to the future of @entity3 , irrespective of the role they have played so far			1
’ but the most pressing issue to be discussed at the @entity7 summit will be to ensure that @entity57 governments launch a co-ordinated withdrawal			0
the prime minister and president @entity80 will ask the new @entity82 president , @entity81 , to ditch his election pledge to withdraw @entity82 ’s 3,300 troops from @entity3 by the end of this year			2
mr @entity81 has already watered down his pledge			0
he now talks about withdrawing combat troops , rather than all troops , by the end of the year			0
but @entity82 officials have made it clear that he is likely to want all troops home during the early part of 2013			0
@entity26 commanders are concerned that an early @entity82 withdrawal will put pressure on @entity26 and the @entity96 to fill the gaps left behind			2
the @entity98 in @entity99 has also discussed warnings that failure to leave in an orderly and co-ordinated manner would leave @entity26 troops at greater risk of attack as they pull out			2
the @entity26 has been in talks with neighbouring @entity107 about pulling soldiers out across that land border			0
removing lots of heavy equipment will add to the costs of the war			0
shadow defence secretary @entity114 said the huge costs of the @entity3 operation made an orderly withdrawal all the more important			0
‘ after the lives sacrificed and the money spent , it is vital that withdrawal does not lead to the return of the conditions which led us to war , ’ he added			0
‘ withdrawal must be internationally co-ordinated and we need a renewed focus on the safety of @entity26 personnel before and beyond 2014			0
