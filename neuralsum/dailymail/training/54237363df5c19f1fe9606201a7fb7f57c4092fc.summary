by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:26 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 11:10 est , 20 may 2013 a former army helicopter pilot has spoken of his excitement at being chosen to spend six months on board the @entity5			2
major @entity7 ’s mission to the @entity5 will see the 41 - year - old blasted into space on a @entity13 @entity12 rocket from @entity14 in @entity15 in november 2015			1
@entity26 is the only @entity27 ever to be accepted into the @entity28			0
his mission will make him the first @entity29 national to travel and work in space , under the @entity33 , on a @entity35 - funded mission			1
other @entity29 astronauts have either secured private funding – such as @entity38 , who flew on a @entity13 rocket in 1991 – or taken dual citizenship , such as @entity41 and @entity42 , who flew missions on the @entity45 space shuttle			1
' this is a momentous day , not just for @entity7 but for @entity18 , ' he said			1
' it is a great sign of our thriving @entity29 space sector , which has seen real growth thanks to our world - class research , and now supports nearly 30,000 jobs			1
' what an achievement that @entity7 was picked for this historic role from over 8,000 applicants from around the world			1
' i am sure he will do us proud and i hope that he will inspire the next generation to pursue exciting careers in science and engineering			2
' @entity26 will carry out a science programme and take part in a @entity69 education initiative before and during his mission , and is one of six astronauts selected from more than 8,000 hopefuls			1
' it really is a true privilege to be assigned to a long duration mission , it feels like a real high point in a long career in aviation , ' he told a news conference at the @entity24 in @entity25			2
' i am really grateful to my family , friends and professional colleagues who are supporting me as i prepare for the challenge that lies ahead			0
' the mission to the @entity5 is going to be a wonderful opportunity , not just for @entity69 and @entity69 science but the @entity29 as well			1
' in a jokey reference to @entity91 fan , commander @entity91 , he said : ' i do play the guitar , but very badly , and i would n't inflict my singing on anybody			0
' @entity95 , from @entity96 , was his country 's first professional astronaut , and gained a legion of fans on the @entity12 space capsule mission to and from the @entity5 , by performing a cover of the @entity91 classic , @entity102			1
@entity103 praised @entity95 for the ' fantastic job ' he had done			0
' i do n't think i 'll be able to top the tweeting , but i will also be tweeting , to encourage a generation to take an interest in space			0
' he said it was too early to say what experiments he would be involved in , but there were ' rolling experiments ' in different fields on the space station which he expected to continue			2
these were in fields such as human physiology , medical research into vaccines , fluids physics and astrobiology			0
he said it was too early to say whether there would be an opportunity for him to do a spacewalk during his tour			0
@entity26 was one of six people to be chosen to be trained as astronauts in 2009 he attends a video conference during his 12 - day stay underwater as he trained smile , you 're on camera : @entity26 practices space - like conditions underwater on top of a mini-sub while a colleague films him on an @entity144 underwater camera in the deep : @entity26 ( second from right ) practices techniques for the asteroid mission underwater with astronaut colleagues deep - sea training : the astronauts train under water on a sea bed that best resembles the surface of an asteroid the @entity29 is now the @entity157 ’s third largest contributor and the agency has responded by opening its first technical base in the country			1
@entity161 , of the @entity162 , welcomed the news of @entity165 ’s @entity26 ’s appointment			0
‘ the @entity29 can now take its rightful place and join in with important microgravity research work on the @entity5 , win industrial contracts for future human space flight projects and forge new links via @entity157 with @entity171 , @entity13 and hopefully @entity172 – and , one day perhaps , @entity173 – in space , ’ he said			1
@entity7 has been selected to go to the @entity5 for five months ‘ with exciting potential mission opportunities coming up for exploration across the solar system to asteroids , the @entity176 , @entity177 and beyond for the future , many young people will be inspired by @entity7 and his achievement			1
' this will really help boost the @entity29 ’s technical employment potential for jobs and industry			2
human space flight is a win - win initiative for the @entity29			2
’ @entity103 , who has been training for the expedition since 2009 , beat more than 8,000 hopefuls to be selected along with five other colleagues from across @entity69			1
it was thought that peake would have only a small role due to the @entity29 's modest contributions to the @entity157 manned space programme his 14 - month training programme included visits to @entity171 ’s astronaut base in @entity201 , the @entity13 astronaut training centre in @entity202 outside @entity203 , @entity204 in @entity205 , and a two - week survival course in @entity207			1
he has also had to complete mock emergency exercises to see how he copes under stress			0
last year it emerged that he was one of a team being trained to land on an asteroid to explore the surface , search for minerals and even learn how they might be able to destroy it should one pose a threat to the @entity218			0
@entity103 , who served in the @entity219 for 18 years , has been waiting to be assigned a space flight since he completed his training in november 2010			2
but he recently insisted that the long wait did not bother him , telling an interviewer			0
‘ it does n’t get frustrating at all			0
there ’s just so much going on , so much diversity , and there ’s brilliant training all along the way			0
’ the @entity231 graduate received a commission with the @entity233 in 1992 and served as a platoon commander with the @entity235 in @entity236			1
he gained his wings in 1994 and became a qualified flight instructor in 1998			0
he retired from the @entity219 in 2009			0

the most experienced @entity29 - born astronaut is @entity171 ’s @entity41			1
he has accumulated 374 days in orbit , completing long - duration missions to both the @entity5 and @entity246 .			0
