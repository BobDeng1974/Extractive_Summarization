by @entity0 the husband of the headmistress at a leading boarding school has been banned from teaching after striking up an inappropriate relationship with a teenage pupil			1
dr @entity6 – who is now divorced from his wife @entity7 – exchanged ‘ personal ’ text messages , emails and phone calls with the ‘ highly vulnerable ’ girl when she was not yet 16			1
he did not teach full time at @entity12 but gave extra tuition to outstanding pupils at the £ 27,000 - a - year establishment in @entity16 whose old girls include @entity19 actress @entity18 , 28 , and former @entity21 mp @entity20 , 41			0
the husband of @entity23 ( pictured right ) , the headmistress of @entity12 , has been banned from teaching after engaging in a relationship with a pupil			0
@entity18 ( left ) was a pupil at the school dr @entity6 , 54 , was found guilty of ‘ unacceptable professional conduct ’ by the government ’s @entity29			1
he and his ex-wife jointly own a holiday home at @entity33 in @entity34 , and dr @entity6 is understood to have moved back to the area in recent months			2
his relationship with a pupil at @entity38 happened some four years ago but the school , which is set in 700 acres near @entity40 , said yesterday that an allegation concerning dr @entity6 was brought to its attention only in may 2011			1
educational authorities investigated and ruled last december after a professional conduct hearing that dr @entity6 will never be allowed to teach again			2
a panel of the @entity29 told in a report how he ‘ engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a vulnerable student which exploited his position of trust ’			2
the girl – now thought to be studying at university – is said to have ‘ confided and discussed a number of highly personal matters with dr @entity6 ’ and they soon began exchanging emails as they began an ‘ increasingly co-dependent ’ relationship			1
the panel felt that the girl – named only as student a – was a highly vulnerable and susceptible individual			2
the £ 27,000 - a - year @entity12 is set in 700 acres and was founded in 1842 the hearing was told : ‘ dr @entity6 also kept a diary towards the end of their relationship to record his feelings towards the student – he would then give the diary to the student			1
there were also occasions when they would meet alone			0
’ the panel said : ‘ we have noted that the acts alleged , whilst unacceptable , have not been subject to criminal prosecution			0
‘ we have noted that during the relevant time he was under significant stress and he has presented evidence to show that he was the subject of psychiatric concerns – he admitted himself to hospital			0
whilst his previously unblemished career does act as mitigation for him , we are concerned that his extensive experience did not prevent him from engaging in such highly inappropriate behaviour			0
’ the report concluded : ‘ dr @entity6 is prohibited from teaching indefinitely and can not teach in any school , sixth form college , relevant youth accommodation or children ’s home in @entity96			1
‘ furthermore , in view of the seriousness of the allegation found proved against him ... dr @entity6 shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of his eligibility to teach			1
’ former pupils include @entity19 star @entity18 ( left ) and @entity105 mp @entity20 ( right ) mrs @entity23 , who was appointed to her post in 2007 , declined to comment yesterday at the red - brick cottage in the @entity12 grounds where she lives with her two children			0
however the highly - rated school said in a statement : ‘ in may 2011 an allegation was brought to the school ’s attention concerning a member of staff at the school , dr @entity6			1
the day the allegation was received , dr @entity6 left the school and resigned from his post shortly afterwards			2
the school adhered strictly to safeguarding procedures and immediately contacted the child protection authorities for them to investigate the matter			0
during the 18 months of the inquiry the school notified the relevant professional authorities and co-operated fully with investigations into the matter up to and including its conclusion			0
‘ on 4 december 2012 , the @entity29 considered the matter and found dr @entity6 guilty of unacceptable professional conduct and conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute			1
the @entity29 recommended that dr @entity6 be prohibited from teaching indefinitely			1
the @entity138 is published on their website			0
as the @entity29 website makes clear the @entity138 was made without naming the school or the student involved			2
‘ this was done in order to protect the welfare of the girl concerned			0
a young person ’s welfare could be impacted adversely by unnecessary speculation or further publication			0
