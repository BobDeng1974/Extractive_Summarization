parents have criticised a school which allowed only pupils who had hit academic targets to join in with a non-uniform day			2
children who had achieved their ‘ accelerated reading target ’ at @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , were allowed to wear their own clothes on friday			1
however , those who had fallen short had to stick with uniform			1
under fire : children who had achieved their ' accelerated reading target ' at @entity5 ( pictured ) in @entity6 , @entity7 , were allowed to wear their own clothes on friday one parent , who did not want to be named , said : ‘ my son is n’t academic but he is good at other things			1
i understand that those who have hit their target deserve a reward but not by isolating those who have n’t			2
’ @entity20 , chairman of the @entity21 , said the idea was ‘ the same as putting a dunce ’s hat on a child ’			1
' i think it ’s extremely discriminatory			0
it ’s depressing for children who have to wear school uniform , ' he said			1
' the children should feel rewarded , a badge or a certificate is fine , but it ’s like the achievment in itself is n’t good enough anymore			0
' isolating ' : however , youngsters who had fallen short of their targets had to stick with uniform ( file picture ) ' it could work if most of the school are hitting their targets but it would be cruel for the children who are in the school uniform			1
' it ’s the equivalent of putting a dunce ’s hat on them in @entity52 times			2
and of course , if only five to 10 per cent of pupils are hitting targets and wearing their own clothes they could also be bullied for it			0
' it ’s inappropriate , discriminatory and unwise in the worst possible sense			0
' but @entity5 , which caters for pupils aged nine to 13 , defended its decision			1
@entity62 , @entity63 , said : ' at @entity5 we reward the positives as much as possible			2
' one such reward is the use of a mufti day			0
targets are not " unobtainable " or " aspirational " but rather will be achieved if the child reads books at their level and takes quizzes			0
' and parent agreed , saying : ' i was really pleased that my son got a reward for reading , he had worked hard			0
' i know people have different opinions but i do n’t see the problem			0

children who met ' accelerated reading target ' wore own clothes on friday
but those who had fallen short of target had to stick with school uniform
rule *condemned* as ' isolating ' and ' same as putting dunce *'s* hat on child '
but @entity5 in @entity95 , @entity7 , defended decision
