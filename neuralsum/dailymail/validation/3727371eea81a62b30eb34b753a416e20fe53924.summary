@entity0 have turned up the heat ahead of a potentially - fraught @entity3 final by slamming the @entity5 ’s decision to let @entity7 midfielder @entity6 play in sunday ’s @entity9 showpiece			1
the @entity10 escaped a red card after referee @entity12 sent off team - mate @entity13 instead in an apparent case of mistaken identity during a stormy @entity17 quarter - final			1
that decision will be the subject of an appeal tribunal on wednesday , when @entity0 will also challenge the red administered to defender @entity22 following his clash with @entity6 last sunday			1
@entity0 have slammed the @entity5 ’s decision to let @entity7 's @entity6 play in the @entity3 final @entity0 will challenge the red shown to defender @entity22 following his clash with @entity6 last sunday @entity7 ’s @entity26 – already banned from the @entity9 showpiece – faces a further two - match suspension for violent conduct after kicking out at @entity31 skipper @entity30			1
but @entity0 are furious that @entity6 will be free to play in the final , even if @entity13 is found to be the victim of a miscarriage of justice			1
a club statement read : ‘ it seems completely illogical and fundamentally unfair that , in an incident where mistaken identity has been claimed , the @entity7 player now identified as being involved appears to have no case to answer – and would be available to play in the @entity3 and the @entity17 replay between the teams – while @entity0 ’s player ( @entity22 ) may potentially miss both of those matches			1
‘ @entity0 and @entity22 maintain their position that no red - card offence was committed by @entity22			1
@entity22 will appear at @entity9 to put his case on thursday and we will fully support him in this appeal			1
’ @entity7 refused to comment publicly on tuesday night , but are privately furious at some of @entity0 ’s comments			1
@entity30 , meanwhile , has escaped retrospective punishment for his tackle on @entity26			2
the @entity7 striker lashed out in retaliation at the @entity58 midfielder before @entity22 and @entity7 ’s @entity13 were controversially dismissed by @entity59 on the advice of assistant @entity61			1
@entity0 's @entity30 accused @entity7 forward @entity26 of ' blatantly ' kicking him in the head there will be no @entity5 action against @entity67 winger @entity66 , however , despite claims by @entity0 the youngster dived to win a penalty in the @entity17 stalemate			1
expressing relief that @entity30 has been cleared to play on sunday , team - mate @entity72 said the @entity5 had reached the right decision in that regard			2
‘ i saw the tackle from @entity78 , ’ said the @entity76			2
‘ it was just a tackle and everything else was just a lot of players around it			0
‘ he would have been a big loss - but i did n’t think that was going to happen			0
he is the captain and means a lot to the team			0
we could see how important he is to the team when he was out at the start of the season			0
he ’s a great player and a fantastic captain			0
he gives it out but he takes it back			0
that is part of his game			0
it ’s not only him in this league who makes hard tackles			0
’ the failure to penalise @entity30 ’s challenge was blamed by @entity7 boss @entity106 for sparking the incident which saw @entity26 lash out with his boot			1
offered a fast - track two - match ban by the @entity5 compliance officer , @entity26 has until 3pm today to respond to the complaint			0
if he declines , a @entity112 will convene tomorrow			0
failure to win his appeal would see the striker miss the @entity17 replay with @entity0 and the subsequent @entity118 clash between the sides			2
despite rising tensions , @entity72 believes the @entity3 final will not go the same way as the @entity17 tie – which was the first of what will now be four games between the teams in a short period			1
‘ it was a weird game , with three red cards and two penalties , ’ he said			2
‘ it affects the game , of course , but i think it will be different this time			0
i don ’ t think what happened on sunday will affect the final			2
it ’s a new game and a trophy is at stake for the winners			0
‘ i am just focusing on ourselves			0
if we go out and play the way we can then we have a great chance			0
