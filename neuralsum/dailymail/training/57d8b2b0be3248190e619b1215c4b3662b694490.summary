by @entity0 published : 19:40 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 04:39 est , 26 november 2013 only 8,000 @entity3 a year will come to @entity4 when restrictions on entry are lifted in january , the country ’s ambassador suggested last night			1
@entity8 ’s forecast is in stark contrast to the 50,000 estimate by the @entity12 pressure group , and will be regarded as a woeful underestimate by experts considering between 8,000 and 10,000 @entity3 already come to the @entity4 every year			1
ministers refuse to make their own forecast after the previous government got its figures so wrong			1
in 2004 , @entity19 estimated 13,000 immigrants a year would arrive when restrictions on @entity22 and other @entity24 countries were lifted			0
the actual figure was more than a million in under a decade			0
looking for a way out : @entity3 queue for visa applications outside @entity4 embassy in the capital , @entity30 a survey yesterday revealed that almost half of @entity4 think the right to work and live in the @entity4 should be blocked for @entity34 and @entity3			1
the poll for @entity36 found that 47 per cent of people thought migrants from the two countries should have no right to live , work or claim benefits in the @entity4			1
a total of 56 per cent believed immigration had had a negative impact on @entity4			1
more than a quarter of voters ( 27 per cent ) said @entity48 had the best immigration policies			0
@entity19 was on 18 per cent , the @entity50 on 12 per cent and the @entity51 on 7 per cent			0
mr @entity8 ’s claim came as ministers last night thrashed out plans with @entity56 lawyers to double the time @entity58 migrants have to wait to claim benefits from three months to six			1
@entity61 , the @entity60 and the @entity51 were also examining plans to force new arrivals to prove that they are seeking work before handing them welfare payments			0
insiders say @entity4 will be fined millions of pounds a day if they seek to restrict benefits further			1
but senior @entity51 sources have indicated they would back tighter rules and @entity72 @entity71 was last night consulting lawyers			0
mr @entity8 told @entity36 that officials should expect ‘ maybe 8,000 immigrants a year ’			1
although the figure is a lot lower than previous estimates , it still means @entity4 will have to build a new town the size of @entity82 or @entity83 every decade to house new arrivals from @entity3 alone			1
earlier this year mr @entity8 ’s @entity34 counterpart , @entity85 , predicted between 15,000 and 25,000 @entity34 arrivals each year			1
mr @entity8 said the government ‘ can not stop the free movement of people and their legal access to the @entity4 labour market ’ and disputed claims that @entity3 will steal jobs from @entity95 people			1
‘ if you are member of @entity58 there is a competition of all job offers at stake			0
everyone should compete for jobs offers on an equal basis if every applicant is a citizen of a member of the @entity58			0
’ @entity8 's forecast is in stark contrast to the 50,000 estimate by the @entity12 pressure group @entity34 and @entity3 have had the right to live and visit the @entity4 without visas since 2007 , but companies have to apply for work permits and migrants for an ‘ accession worker card ’ if they want to be employed as regular staff			1
these restrictions will be lifted in january			0
sir @entity120 , who signed a @entity122 motion calling for controls to be kept in place on @entity3 and @entity34 immigrants , said even the 8,000 figure cited by the ambassador was too high			1
he added : ‘ it is crystal clear that these people are coming here and they will add massive demand to @entity4 services and housing			2
‘ immigration is a massive issue for the @entity4 people , who have been held in slavery for the last few years , frightened to speak out about their fears on immigration			2
’ @entity142 and @entity51 sources confirmed they were looking at plans to tighten welfare rules so that new arrivals had to wait six months rather than three before claiming benefits			0
any change would affect all @entity58 arrivals , not just @entity3 and @entity34 migrants			2
mr @entity71 is also drawing up plans to insist that many more questions are asked in the habitual residency test , to establish properly if the claimant is really trying to find work			0
one @entity142 mp said ministers were under pressure from backbenchers to ‘ have a fight ’ with the @entity159 , even if it was not successful			2
the mp added : ‘ several of us are arguing that it would be better to take on the system than just back down and say we are powerless to act			0
’ @entity19 grandees have admitted they made a ‘ spectacular mistake ’ by opening @entity4 ’s borders a decade ago			2
former labour home secretary @entity168 when @entity22 and other countries from @entity24 entered the @entity58 in 2004 , @entity4 lifted labour market controls that would have prevented people from those countries coming to work in the @entity4 – while most other @entity58 nations kept them in place for seven more years			2
officials estimated that just 13,000 migrants would flock to the @entity4 a year			1
in fact , nearly one million came to work from those countries to work in @entity4 , the equivalent of a city the size of @entity183			2
@entity168 , who was home secretary under the last government , recently admitted it was a ‘ well - intentioned policy that we messed up ’ and the estimates were ‘ worthless ’			0
mr @entity168 said : ‘ one spectacular mistake in which i participated ( not alone ) was in lifting the transitional restrictions on the @entity24 states like @entity22 and @entity191 which joined the @entity58 in mid- 2004			0
we thought that it would be good for @entity4 if these folk could come and work here from 2004			2
‘ @entity195 suggested that the impact of this benevolence would in any event be “ relatively small , at between 5,000 and 13,000 immigrants per year up to 2010 ”			0
’ @entity200 , mr @entity168 ’s successor as home secretary , warned that @entity4 cities could face riots as an influx of @entity206 migrants created ‘ frictions ’ .			0

@entity8 's forecast is in stark contrast to the 50,000 estimate by pressure group @entity12
it will be regarded as a woeful underestimate by experts considering between 8,000 and 10,000 @entity3 already come to the @entity4 every year
ministers refuse to give their own forecast after the previous government got its figures so wrong
