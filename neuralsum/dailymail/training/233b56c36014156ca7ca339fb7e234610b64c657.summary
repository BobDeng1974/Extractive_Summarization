@entity2 ’s embarrassing early exit from the @entity3 needs to be a wake - up call that something is fundamentally wrong in our national game and it needs fixing or we ’ll be also - rans for ever			1
to say that we are now a laughing stock is not right , but only because our major rivals did n’t start this @entity3 genuinely fearing @entity2			1
@entity2 crashing out is not a surprise to them , or to be honest with ourselves , to us			1
in my opening column i feared @entity2 may not get out of @entity13 i desperately wanted to be wrong but we could not cope when we came up against true quality : @entity16 and @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
’ yes , it is			0
and there is no point in shying away from identifying several specific areas where @entity2 got it wrong or were simply not up to the job			1
at the back , @entity2 were below par , incapable of handling clinical finishers			1
there are problems in midfield			0
there ’s a lack of confidence all around the pitch			0
on - pitch leaders are lacking			2
and @entity64 fell between two stools in his approach to mixing youth and experience			1
he left behind the nous - heavy , tournament - hardened @entity70 and @entity69 , played his captain @entity72 in a tough role , and gave youth its head only to an extent			1
hindsight is a wonderful thing but there was a case for saying up front that this was going to be an event to gain experience , for the youngsters , across the whole xi. they ’d learn how to prepare , play , rest , gain that high intensity experience			0
head boy : @entity90 has been one of @entity2 's best players at the @entity3 impact player : @entity93 has come on for @entity2 twice as substitute during the @entity3 learning curve : @entity96 is yet to feature for @entity2 at the @entity3 but has gained vital experience when i went to a @entity3 as a kid in 1998 , i soaked it up like a sponge but there ’s nothing like getting stuck in , full immersion			1
yet the real shame in our national game and the issue that has to be tackled urgently is that we just do not have enough good players			0
with respect to the 23 in the squad , including some seasoned veterans who have done it all at club level and some extremely talented youngsters , our talent pool is puddle deep			2
much as we can all talk about the promise of @entity90 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity93 , @entity96 , @entity120 , that just ’s half a dozen people aged 24 or under			0
we should n’t be talking in single digits , we should expect many dozens			0
@entity125 have a population of five million			0
@entity127 , @entity128 and @entity18 have even fewer			0
is it not now blindingly obvious that something is very wrong when @entity2 , the home of football , the country that codified the game and took it to the world , a country with 53 million people , can not field a decent team ? young gun : @entity140 jokes around as @entity2 train during the @entity142 in @entity143 talking tactics : @entity140 chats with then @entity2 manager as @entity2 prepare for the @entity142 we lack facilities and coaches at all levels , and opportunities for top - level playing experience for the best young players			1
i was part of the @entity154 who considered these issues ; one report has been published and another is on its way			0
some suggestions for change are controversial but let ’s be absolutely clear : there are very specific identifiable issues			0
i ’ll give you just a tiny example			0
in the whole of @entity2 there are 639 @entity171 all - weather pitches			1
@entity172 have more than 5,000			1
an @entity154 survey of clubs at all levels found 84 per cent of respondents saying facilities are poor			0
this directly impacts on how many teams and at what age - groups kids can play			2
we have too few coaches , and those we have are not as well qualified as they should be			1
@entity186 have 25,000 coaches with @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190			2
coaching is respected elsewhere , valued , literally			0
in @entity172 and the @entity193 a youth coach can earn £ 40,000 a year			1
in @entity2 the equivalent pay is £ 16,000			1
that ’s vocational , a hobby			0
anyone who can not see the link between all these factors and an under - performing @entity2 team is kidding themselves			1
touch tight : @entity204 closes down @entity19 during @entity2 's defeat to @entity18 on thursday centre of attention : @entity28 rises above @entity19 to clear the ball for @entity2 @entity2 have conceded goals via poor defending			1
it ’s unacceptable and in tournament terms it ’s been the killer			0
why ca n’t we concentrate ? as soon as @entity2 equalised against @entity18 on thursday , i was whooping off - air every bit as much as @entity217 and @entity218 alongside me			1
then i said i ’d take the draw immediately because i feared what might happen next			0
we do n’t have top - class centre halves			1
there is no intention here to demean the capabilities of @entity204 and @entity28 , and i mean that sincerely			1
the worrying truth is , they are the best players available for @entity2 with enough game time under their belts			2
@entity204 is an eight out 10 man every game he plays for @entity233			2
@entity28 is the most improved @entity234 defender in the @entity235 in recent years , indeed a @entity237 winner since he moved to @entity238			2
but we ’re talking about international football at the highest level			2
and are they good enough ? left back : @entity69 was overlooked by @entity64 for the @entity3 despite all his experience missed a trick : @entity64 should have included @entity70 ( right ) in his 23 - man @entity3 squad what you need at a @entity3 is to utilise the very best defensive unit as a whole that you do have , with the most experience , and @entity2 left that at home in the shape of @entity69 at left back and @entity70 in the key defensive midfielder role			1
i wo n’t even go into the situation with @entity257 , because he was not available			0
but suffice to say that in an ideal world you would take and use all your best players at a @entity3			2
and for various reasons , @entity2 have n’t done that			2
@entity262 and @entity72 were both tasked with impossible jobs and that has led to us ending up with unsatisfactory compromises			0
let ’s look ahead now , everyone is saying , let ’s look to @entity271 , it ’s not all doom and @entity273 hope it ’s not			0
but unless we get the big picture right , i fear we ’ll be back here in a couple of years saying all this again			0
to celebrate the @entity3 , i 've added a special @entity278 to my fashion range , incorporating all the flags of the participating nations and and with a share of the proceeds going to charity			2
you can find them via www.5mag.co and you can follow me on @entity287 for a chance to win exclusive prizes @ rioferdy5			0

@entity2 crashing out of the @entity3 is not a surprise to our rivals
are @entity28 and @entity204 international level centre backs ?
@entity64 should have taken @entity69 and @entity70 to @entity297
@entity2 only have 639 @entity171 all - weather pitches compared to 5,000 in @entity172
@entity2 have 6,000 qualified coaches compared to 35,000 in @entity172
