' real women do curse			2
they sleep around , they use drugs , they do all sorts of different things and some of them are good mothers and some are bad mothers			0
' surprising words , you might think , for the woman still best known as a ditzy law student in @entity11			0
but then the latest @entity13 epic , @entity14 , is new territory for @entity16			1
based on a best - selling 2012 book of the same name , the £ 30 million film is the remarkable story of how writer @entity21 set off on a 1,100 - mile hike to ' find herself ' after a bitter divorce and the death of her mother			1
the film is tipped to earn witherspoon her second @entity38			1
she says : ' after @entity21 's mother died , she was very self - destructive			1
she was married but she slept around			0
she had no respect for her husband and she had no respect for herself			0
' she was so angry and in such pain that she wanted to do anything to help herself feel alive – that included having sex with strangers , doing drugs , putting herself in dangerous situations			1
' while the book and film closely guard the identity of the husband whose rejection prompted the marathon walk – both refer to him simply as ' @entity57 ' – the @entity58 can today reveal that he is 48 - year - old baker @entity59			1
@entity16 said writer @entity21 ( right ) was ' self - destructive ' after the death of her mother , pictured at the premiere at the 58th @entity63 @entity59 , now a happily married father - of - two living in rural @entity65 , @entity66 , walked out on @entity21 after she admitted repeatedly cheating on him			1
in his first ever interview about his famous former wife , he told the @entity69 that he held no grudges against her – but added that the painful disintegration of a marriage described in the book is all true			2
he said @entity21 and her family ' collapsed ' after her mother died			1
' we were just 21 when we married			0
we were much too young and we should n't have got married , ' said @entity59			0
' i was the administrator , the caretaker			0
it was after [ her mother ] died that @entity21 started seeing other guys			1
it was the catalyst for a lot of what followed , ' he explained			0
the film follows the story of how @entity21 sets out to hike the @entity86 all on her own after the breakdown of her marriage ' she takes risks , ' he said of @entity21			1
' she always took risks with her writing and she 's an incredibly intelligent person			0
she just fell into this deep hole			0
her perception was true and strong			0
' the last time @entity59 and @entity21 spoke was 16 years ago when she called up wondering if they could be friends again			1
he says he did n't see the need			0
indeed , as the years went by , he was barely aware of @entity21 's book			1
' my parents called and told me that @entity21 had written a book and that i was all over it			1
that was about six weeks after it had been published			0
i always figured that at some point in time i was going to end up somewhere in her writing			0
' ' i 'm ok with it , ' he said			0
' i do n't have a problem with what she 's written			0
' the book was a @entity115 bestseller and a selection for @entity117			2
it chronicles @entity21 's descent into heroin abuse , nights of casual sex – and how she ' emotionally rebuilt ' herself during her epic journey few outside his close family and friends know @entity59 is ' @entity57 '			1
but his hopes of remaining one step ahead of the past faded once @entity16 signed on to star as his ex-wife in the @entity13 version of her story			1
while @entity21 , 46 , has always refused to identify ' @entity57 ' , she spoke briefly about her guilt over the breakdown of their relationship in a recent interview saying : ' it was just so , so ugly and painful			1
' i was tormented by it			0
i was devastated by the fact that i felt this deep need to leave the one person who was there for me			0
' @entity16 , 38 , who both stars in and produces the new movie , admitted to the @entity69 that the role had been emotionally and physically tough			1
' usually i can go in and out of a character , but this one was very difficult , ' she said			0
' i got quite angry and bitter and got into the ' do n't give me any crap ' attitude			2
after a while , my husband was like , ' whoa ! are you still @entity21 right now ? because you do not sound like yourself			1
' and he said , ' ok … i love @entity21 , she 's amazing , but i am going to be really happy when this movie is over			1
' ' i consider @entity21 a very dear friend now			1
but parts of her book were not easy to read and when we made the film i had to make the choice to tell all the parts , not just the ones that would make us like her , or it would just be a movie about a girl taking a walk			1
@entity16 , 38 , who both stars in and produces the new movie , admitted that the role had been emotionally and physically tough ' and trust me , there were scenes in the movie that i did not want to do			1
there was one particular sex scene that i was dreading			2
' the day before , i was calling @entity21 saying : ' i can not believe i have to do that sex scene tomorrow			1
' she said , ' @entity16 , i 'm sorry i was such a slut in the @entity180			2
' @entity16 is convinced that how women are portrayed in films is changing			2
' twenty years ago , i used to sit in meetings with studio heads and they 'd say , ' well , this character must n't curse			0
that 's really not very likeable			0
' ' we do n't have that idea of what a woman is any more : is she good or is she bad ? it 's much more complex			0
' i have had my own set of problems in life , some of which people know about and some people do n't			2
' but what i have learned from them is that there are times when you realise that no one is coming in to save you			0
you have to save yourself			0
no mother or father or relationship or baby is going to fix your problems			2
you have to find the inner strength to look after yourself			2
' the film did n't just take an emotional toll			2
' in most movies where you carry a backpack , it 's just filled with newspaper but this one was really heavy , ' she laughed			0
' plus , the first few days were really cold and i had to wear shorts and a t - shirt and they had to spray me with water to look like i was sweating – and all the while , the guys on the other side of the camera were in hats and parkas and looking cosy while i was walking along pretending not to be shivering			2
' about three days into the shoot , my shoulders hurt so bad and were so sore and i was freezing cold , and i called my husband and was sobbing , ' oh , this movie is so hard ! it 's so cold ! ' he said , ' ok , honey , when you option a book called @entity14 about a woman who hikes 1,000 miles through the wilderness by herself … did you think it was going to be a super-easy , fun shoot ? ' ' i said - i know , shut up			1
