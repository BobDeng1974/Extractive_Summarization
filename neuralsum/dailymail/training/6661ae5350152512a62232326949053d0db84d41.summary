drunk driving is a big no - no , and apparently so is swimming while sloshed			1
in a new video mocking the repercussions of having just a little bit too much fun in the sun , a group of @entity3 youngsters have proved just how deadly alcohol consumption can be			1
be warned - this clip is not for the fainthearted			1
the video was originally posted on @entity13 by 22 - year - old twin brothers @entity15 and @entity16 , who wanted to parody the old - fashioned infomercials they used to watch as children , but maintaining the important message			1
speaking to @entity21 about the shocking video , which features a girl jumping to her death due to drinking and an increasingly bloody , yet darkly humorous sketch , the two filmmakers said they wanted to highlight the dangers of drinking and swimming			1
@entity15 told @entity21 : ' it 's summer here in @entity3 with the weather reaching up to 45 degrees			1
everyone here is either at the beach or in their pool			2
' i know we take the p * * * out of it , but alcohol related drownings is a pretty serious issue here and we wanted to shed some light on it ( in our own twisted way )			2
' we hate those infomercials , it parodies the entire thing while still getting the message across			1
' drunken madness : a new video set in @entity55 , @entity53 has a very powerful message about the dangers of drinking and swimming the young filmmakers chose a place called @entity62 to shoot the video , claiming it is ' an infamous spot for drunks to hoon , drink and cliff dive			1
' they added : ' hopefully anyone watching the video will think twice before drink swimming in the future , you never know when death is gon na rock up , run over your friend and send your car into the ocean killing everyone you 've ever loved			1
be warned ! ' at the start of the graphic video , a gang of male teens from @entity80 feel utterly invincible			1
consequently , the know - it - alls ignore the warnings of professor @entity86 , from the ( fake ) @entity88 research center , who appears to be making a documentary about safe water play			1
the academic says : ' what you are about to see will change your mind about drinking and swimming			2
' invincible : the drunk teens do n't listen to safety advice and begin jumping off cliffs like maniacs of course , the boys scream ' ah p * * * off mate ' , before throwing sand at him and fueling up on alcohol			2
that 's where their fun begins ... and soon ends			0
the young revellers begin flipping off cliffs and landing in the water beneath - cheering one another on as they crack open bottles of beer - in some astonishing footage which would make even the toughest bloke 's stomach turn			2
it is obvious that something disastrous is about to occur , especially when a pretty new arrival appears			0
taking a @entity122 turn : a young girl tries to impress the boys by downing alcohol and jumping off the cliff too but the @entity127 comes out to play ... standing on an even higher point of the cliff , ' @entity128 ' follows the boys lead and chugs her alcoholic beverage before jumping off			0
they try to persuade her not to as she could break a leg by falling into shallow water , however she ignores their pleas in a bid to prove she is tough too			0
the @entity127 suddenly emerges and lurks over her , symbolising how her actions are about to take her straight to death 's door			0
@entity142 and behold , the next image that appears is of the girl lying face - down in a pool of blood at the bottom of the cliff			2
shallow waters : she kills herself by smashing onto a rock pool below her screaming friends rush to her rescue and attempt to take her to hospital in a gruesome scene where her leg gets caught in the car door ( an unpleasant squelch occurs as her limb is squashed )			0
covered in her blood , the boys are too drunk to control the car and end up hitting one of their friends on the road before he has the chance to climb in			0
' i do n't think its in reverse mate , ' another boy frantically yells as the driver flies the vehicle off the pier			0
hospital : her friends try to rush her safety but they are too drunk to control the car and end up driving into the sea where they all join her in death graphic : despite being very funny , this video is not for the faint - hearted better to be safe than sorry : they really ought to have listened to accident expert professor @entity86 as the car floods with its passengers roaring for help , the @entity127 returns to reveal their fate			1
meanwhile , the responsible professor floats nearby in a rubber boat to give some last minute words of wisdom			0
' you know alcohol numbs your senses , ' he states before teasing the last remaining boy with his rowing stick			0
' you want it ? you ca n't have it ! ' then the drunken young man is then drowned by the @entity127			0
