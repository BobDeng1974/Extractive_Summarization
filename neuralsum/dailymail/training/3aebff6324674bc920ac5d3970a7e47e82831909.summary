by @entity0 - parkinson published : 04:12 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 07:54 est , 26 february 2013 the health and safety warning was sent out ahead of filming for an episode in which the ashes of @entity4 were scattered tv sets can often be dangerous places , but it appears as though the @entity8 might have taken things a step too far			1
the corporation recently filed a nine - page report outlining the health and safety risks of working in @entity14 , @entity15 , with a dog that was hired for the day			0
in a risk assessment carried out for an episode in which the ashes of @entity4 were scattered , actors were even warned about the dangers of the potentially harmful results of working with sheep			1
the document circulated among the cast and crew before the shoot told of the dangers of ' slippery ' surfaces and cold weather			1
it also gave advice such as wearing ' appropriate clothing ' and told workers to take ' warm drinks ' for the scene which was filmed on @entity36			1
a source on the set told @entity39 : ' the @entity8 does n't help itself sometimes with such nonsense			2
the cast and crew were in hysterics			0
' it 's a waste of time and shows the fear factor that 's spread through the corporation			0
' among those to receive the memo were characters @entity51 and @entity52 , played by @entity53 and @entity54 respectively , and saw them scattering @entity4 's ashes			0
because a dog called @entity58 was hired for the day there was a warning about how to handle him , but it went well beyond the treatment of the dog			0
danger zone ? the filming took place at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity66 the report said : ' animals can cause injury , by bites , scratches , stings , kicking or crushing ; infection or infestation from micro-organisms or parasites			0
' it also warned that there was a risk of miscarriage in pregnant workers because of harmful organisms on animals , ' especially sheep '			2
a @entity8 spokesman said : ' there is a legal requirement to undertake a risk assessment and this covered a wider range of activities than just working in the park			1
' they added that risk assessments cover blocks of filming and not just one episode .			2

one warning tells of dangers of pregnant women working with sheep
another *offers* advice on what to do to keep warm
@entity8 says document covers block of filming not just one episode
