with a swing of his right boot unleashing a sumptuous curling strike into the top corner of @entity6 's net , @entity0 had breathed hope into @entity10 's @entity9 ambitions as the game entered added time			1
after an atrocious performance against a @entity14 side that only scored four times in the group stages , a 2 - 1 defeat , rather than 2 - 0 , gave a different dimension to the cup tie for @entity21 's side			1
those @entity10 fans left inside the @entity23 could sense it			0
@entity0 hauled @entity10 back into the @entity9 tie with @entity14 with a late goal @entity14 goalkeeper @entity6 dived left but was unable to get close to @entity0 's strike but @entity0 lost possession three minutes later , his error resulting in @entity14 's third goal but only three minutes and seven seconds later , that hope had turned into a dying breath for @entity10 and it was @entity0 who helped administer what could prove to be the knock - out blow			1
he ran into trouble in midfield , lost possession to @entity39 and once again , @entity14 sprang into attack			0
@entity10 had too many men forward as the tired legs of their defenders tried desperately to keep up with @entity44 , a 74th minute substitute , who gleefully raced clear and punished @entity0 with a finish so cool and clinical , @entity47 , the man he replaced , was undoubtedly tipping his hat			0
realising the cost of his mistake , @entity49 international @entity0 covers his face with his shirt @entity54 ( left ) consoles team - mate @entity0 after the game had ended at the @entity23 the @entity49 international could see the damage his mistake had caused , covering his face with his shirt as @entity14 celebrated extending their advantage to two goals			2
