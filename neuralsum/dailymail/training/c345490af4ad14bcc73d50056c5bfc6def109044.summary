by @entity1 reporter published : 11:50 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 12:26 est , 2 december 2013 for months , @entity2 was a television staple and practically every minute of her murder trial was broadcast live			1
but @entity5 has vanished from view since her trial ended in may , and the judge has done a complete about - face			1
she has shut the media and public out of nearly every hearing in the case and drawn complaints from @entity16 lawyers that she has gone too far			0
new venture : convicted killer @entity2 has launched a book club from behind bars and is sharing her reviews attorney @entity24 represents several media outlets fighting for transparency in the case			1
he says there have been repeated violations of the public 's constitutional right to attend proceedings in the case			2
@entity5 , 33 , admitted she killed her boyfriend in 2008 at his suburban @entity37 home but claimed it was self - defense			2
@entity2 suffered nearly 30 knife wounds , had his throat slit and was shot in the forehead in what prosecutors argued was a jealous rage			1
although she was convicted of murder in may , but the jury could n't reach a verdict on her sentence			2
prosecutors are now pursuing a second penalty phase with a new jury in an effort to get the death penalty			1
no date for a new trial has been set			2
killed : @entity5 murdered her ex-boyfriend @entity2 , pictured , who was found stabbed and shot in 2008 judge @entity59 has held hearing after hearing behind closed doors as the next steps of the case unfold almost entirely under a shroud of secrecy			1
over the last several months , she has heard arguments over sequestering the new jury , moving the case out of @entity37 , @entity5 ' desire to fire her lead attorney and allowing live television coverage of the retrial , among other issues			0
she has denied each request , but quietly with orders released days after the secret hearings as the case languishes without public scrutiny even as @entity5 ' legal tab is being picked up by taxpayers at a cost exceeding $ 1.7 million			2
meanwhile , in yet another element of secrecy , @entity83 attorney @entity82 has refused to provide a tally of how much it has cost to prosecute the case , including paying for expert witnesses throughout the five - month trial			2
@entity59 allowed virtually unfettered access to the first trial , which was broadcast live and became to fans like a real - life soap opera as they traveled from around the country to get in the courtroom			1
she now says the hearing closures are intended to protect @entity5 ' right to an impartial jury , but @entity100 says the judge has gone to the extreme , often simply locking the courtroom doors without issuing an order as to why , in violation of the @entity107 @entity106			1
out of the spotlight : unlike the original trial in may , the new sentencing trial of @entity2 wo n't be broadcast on national television ' the public is deprived of its @entity16 right to attend criminal proceedings , ' @entity24 said			1
' the public has a right to be heard before they 're just locked out			0
' @entity16 of the @entity106 guarantees such basic rights as freedom of speech and the press			0
even arguments by attorneys over media access to proceedings in the case have been closed to the media			0
an irony not lost on @entity24 is that the intense media interest in the case has largely evolved from @entity5 ' own actions by courting interviews and operating a @entity133 account and selling her artwork from behind bars through a third party			0
she regularly posts inspirational quotes , links to purchase her drawings and solicitations for donations for her appeals			0
a clerk for @entity59 said the judge could not comment on an ongoing case			0
defense lawyer @entity147 has not returned telephone messages			0
while all the requests to close hearings have come from defense attorneys , prosecutors have n't objected			0
life or death ? @entity5 is still awaiting a second trial after jurors couldn Â¿ t come to a decision on whether or not she should receive the death penalty for the 2008 murder of her boyfriend ' it 's a balance , but i believe when push comes to shove , a defendant 's right to a fair trial is probably going to trump what otherwise is considered the public 's right to attend trial , ' @entity82 said			1
@entity37 defense lawyer @entity172 , a former @entity83 judge and federal prosecutor , said the judge likely never expected the @entity5 case would attract such publicity and is now trying to dial back access to protect the record for inevitable appeals			1
' the more that comes out , the harder it 's going to be to find an impartial jury and the greater the risk of prejudice and error , ' @entity172 said			0
@entity24 does n't buy it			0
he said the judge 's decision to ban live television coverage and the use of all electronic devices , meaning reporters wo n't be able to provide real - time updates via @entity133 as occurred during the first trial , is a ' severe overcorrection ' that will ' deprive the public a lens into the concluding chapter of this trial			1

@entity2 was convicted in may of murdering her boyfriend
the trial consumed @entity107 's airwaves
