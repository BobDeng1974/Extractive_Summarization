by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:45 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 05:37 est , 12 december 2013 @entity3 minister @entity2 said legal highs had already caused too many young deaths legal high producers could be forced to prove their drugs are safe under a government clampdown to prevent more deaths linked to dangerous substances			1
police and ministers are constantly playing catch - up with the creators of legal highs , who tweak the chemical make - up of banned substances to get around the law			1
@entity3 minister @entity2 warned that people who take legal highs can not be sure they are safe or legal , and said they have claimed the lives of ‘ far too many young people in our country ’			1
suppliers get round existing drugs laws by describing their substances as ‘ plant food ’ or chemicals used fotr rsearch			2
ministers fear that even schoolchildren are able to legally buy legal highs which are potentially more dangerous than ecstasy			1
the new review will look at how the @entity37 's laws and enforcement against new psychoactive substances , also known as legal highs , can be improved			2
options to be considered will include widening legislation to ensure police and law enforcement agencies have better - tailored powers			0
the move comes as the government announces that two new groups of psychoactive substances - @entity49 and @entity51 - will become classified as @entity53 and @entity54 drugs respectively			1
mr @entity2 , the crime prevention minister , said : ‘ the coalition government is determined to clamp down on the reckless trade in so - called legal highs , which has tragically already claimed the lives of far too many young people in our country			1
‘ despite being marketed as legal alternatives to banned drugs , users can not be sure of what they contain and the impact they will have on their health			2
nor can they even be sure that they are legal			2
‘ our review will consider how current legislation can be better tailored to enable the police and law enforcement officers to combat this dangerous trade and ensure those involved in breaking the law are brought to justice			0
‘ @entity49 and @entity51 are drugs which have caused serious harm and in some cases death to those who have taken them			1
outlawing them is crucial in the battle to restrict their supply and use			0
’ @entity49 and benzofuran compounds are currently under a temporary banning order , which will become permanent when legislation is passed next year			1
deadly : a sample of 251 - @entity49 - a recently discovered psychedelic substance which is to be banned @entity92 , 21 , is said to have gone ' crazy ' at an all - night party after taking a mind - bending drug known as @entity49			1
as he was suffering terrifying hallucinations , mr @entity92 , a leisure centre lifeguard , was heard shouting and pleading : ' i want it to stop			0
' he then broke a wine glass on a bedside cabinet and used a thick shard to slice his throat open			0
an inquest heard that mr @entity92 and friend @entity104 , 27 , had gone to a party at the luxury flat of @entity107 , 28 , near @entity108			0
the court was told she had already picked up some cocaine and vodka to share with revellers but mr @entity104 supplied the @entity49 drug to his friend			1
he believed it was lsd and said he wanted to ' test ' its effect before visiting the @entity121			0
@entity49 is also known to have killed at least five people in @entity124 states including @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			1
the @entity128 ( @entity128 ) last month recommended both substances are banned permanently			0
the review will be led by the @entity3 , with input from experts in law enforcement , science , health and academia and will present its findings in spring 2014			1
the @entity3 has also published updated guidance for local government on the different action trading standards can take against shops selling new psychoactive substances			1
ten ‘ legal highs ’ were identified last year for the first time in the @entity37 by a specialist @entity145 system that targets music festivals and tobacco shops			2
a total of 27 new psychoactive substances , also known as legal highs , have now been detected by the @entity3 's @entity152 since it was set up in january 2011			1
official figures also show that the number of deaths being linked to legal highs soared by 80 % last year to 52 , from 29 in 2011			2
@entity157 , chief executive of @entity158 , a charity supporting professionals working in drug and alcohol treatment , said : ‘ it has been clear for some time that the law has been unable to keep pace with the chemistry when it comes to the production and supply of new drugs			2
‘ as @entity158 's recent @entity172 highlighted , in some areas so - called ' legal highs ' are not only being sold online and in ' headshops ' , but in outlets such as newsagents , petrol stations and take - away food shops			2
‘ this is an attempt by the @entity3 to bolster current enforcement efforts and to see what other legislative options could be brought to bear on this new and complex drug situation			1
‘ however , it is important to remember that the law by itself can not bring this trade under control			0
‘ it is vital that education and information efforts are significantly enhanced in order to make the public - especially young people - more aware of the risks posed by experimenting with substances of unknown content and origin			0
these substances are not labelled ' research chemicals ' by sellers for nothing			0
’ @entity202 crime and security minister @entity200 said : ‘ the home secretary came into office promising ' swift action ' on legal highs			1
three years later she is launching a review			0
‘ in the meantime hundreds of substances have come on to the @entity37 market and thousands of sellers have opened up			0
‘ while the government have failed to act , hundreds of thousands of young people have been trying these drugs , and sadly this has often had fatal consequences			0
‘ while the home secretary has been burying her head in the sand , local authorities across the country have been trying to close down the high street shops selling these drugs but they have consistently been thwarted by hopelessly out of date legislation , which allows sellers to pretend that these drugs are research chemicals			0
‘ instead of telling local authorities what the law is , the government should be updating it			0
’ in july , @entity230 proposed an amendment to @entity232 to enable successful prosecutions of shops selling legal highs			2
ms @entity200 added : ‘ if the government was serious about helping to close down these shops they 'd back our amendment in the @entity241 in january			0
