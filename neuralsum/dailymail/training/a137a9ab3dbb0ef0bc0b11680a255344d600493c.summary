by @entity0 published : 07:08 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 08:55 est , 8 august 2013 restaurant customers tip more generously if the bill arrives in a heart - shaped dish , a new study has found			1
psychologists believe the symbolic shape generates feelings of love and compassion , which leads people to act more altruistically			1
they said restaurant managers would be well - advised to use heart - shaped dishes as this could have benefits for both staff and customers			1
psychologists believe the symbolic shape generates feelings of love and compassion , which leads people to act more altruistically the findings come from a study that compared tipping behaviour when customers were served the bill in either a round , square , or heart - shaped dish			1
lead author professor @entity25 , of the @entity26 , in @entity27 , said : ‘ customers gave tips more often to a waitress when the bill was placed in a dish with a cardioid ( heart ) shape and , when they did , they gave her a larger amount of money			1
the heart shape has been used to express the idea that the heart is a person 's centre of emotion and love for hundreds of years			2
there are many theories as to how the symbol came about - some experts believe it is reminiscent of a person 's lips or a female 's genitalia			1
others , however , believe it took its original form from plants , more specifically the ivy leaf			0
the symbol was first used in the @entity57 but it was not widely recognised until the 16th century			0
the ' scalloped ' shape of the now - familiar heart symbol , with a dent in its base , first arose in the early 14th century , at first only slightly dented			2
the red colour symbolises blood , passion and strong emotion			0
‘ this effect was found for both male and female patrons			0
‘ we can conclude that inducing love by the symbolic shape associated with this concept ( the heart ) is a strong technique to enhance people ’s altruistic behaviour			2
’ the study , published online in the @entity78 , involved 365 customers and five waitresses working in three seafood restaurants in @entity27			0
customers sat alone at a table to eat and the waitresses were told to always act in the same way and to serve the bill with the same words in a dish with two sweets			2
the dishes were all red , of similar size and made by the same company , so all that changed was the shape			0
professor @entity25 found no difference in tipping behaviour in relation to the different waitresses and different restaurants			0
but nearly half of people - 46 per cent - who got their bill in a heart - shaped dish tipped , compared to 31 per cent who got a round dish , and 26 per cent who got a square dish			1
restaurant customers tip more generously if the bill arrives in a heart - shaped dish , a new study has found tips left in a heart - shaped dish were 1.38 euros on average , compared to 1.19 euros in a round dish and 1.17 euros in a square dish			1
the difference was seen despite the fact that tipping in @entity27 is not expected because a 12 per cent service charge is added to prices listed on a menu			0
‘ managers , then , should encourage these methods , in so far as they may create a greater state of fulfilment in the workplace for the employees , ’ the authors concluded			0
‘ furthermore , these methods may , in turn , result in much more contentment and satisfaction for the customer , thus encouraging the customer to come back or to recommend the restaurant			2

experts at the @entity26 found the symbol generated feelings of love which led people to becoming more generous
46 **%** of people who received their bill in a heart - shaped dish left a tip
only 26 **%** of those presented with a square dish tipped
people given a heart - shaped dish are more likely to recommend the restaurant and to return
