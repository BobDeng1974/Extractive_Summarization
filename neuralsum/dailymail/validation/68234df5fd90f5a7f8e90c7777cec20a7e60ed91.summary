ditching green energy targets would save every household in @entity3 around £ 214 a year , a report reveals today			1
the @entity5 paper concludes that the rush for renewable energy has been the ‘ most expensive policy disaster in modern @entity3 history ’			1
shifting to wind and solar power have hugely increased costs to consumers , while creating an energy supply that is ‘ intermittent ’			1
as a result , huge additional investment has been required in backup capacity to cover for when the wind is n’t blowing and the sun is n’t shining			0
shifting to wind and solar power have hugely increased costs to consumers , while creating an energy supply that is ‘ intermittent ’ ( file picture ) and billions more have been spent to connect remote wind farms to the national grid			1
author @entity27 concludes that , astonishingly , no @entity3 government has conducted a rigorous analysis of the costs and benefits of the renewables target which was first negotiated by @entity33 at the @entity34 in 2007			1
the government is committed to providing 15 per cent of its energy from renewable power by 2020			2
mr @entity27 , the author of @entity40 , concludes that the annual costs of the renewables target is a staggering £ 9billion			1
switching back to a free market in power would save households around £ 214 a year , assuming that gas replaces renewables , he says			1
the report says : ‘ energy policy represents the biggest expansion of state power since the nationalisations of the 1940s and 1950s			2
it is on course to be the most expensive domestic policy disaster in modern @entity3 history			1
‘ by committing the nation to high , cost , unreliable renewable energy , its consequences will be felt for decades			1
’ ‘ in addition to their higher plant - level costs , renewables require massive amounts of extra generating capacity to provide cover for intermittent generation when the wind does n’t blow and the sun does n’t shine			0
’ the report concludes that the costs of ‘ intermittent renewables ’ have been ‘ massively understated ’			0
as a result , ‘ massively subsidiesed wind and solar capacity floods the market with near random amounts of zero marginal cost electricity			0
’ ‘ to keep the lights on , everything ends up requiring subsidies , turning what was once a profitable sector into the energy equivalent of the @entity87			0
’ the cost of the national grid has nearly trebled as a result of connecting to remote wind farms , he says			0
more solar and wind means @entity3 is having to more than double its overall capacity , because additional sources are needed when wind is n’t working			2
without renewable energy , the @entity3 would need @entity100 of new capacity to replace old coal and nuclear stations , but as a result of renewable energy , an additional @entity104 is required , the report says			1
the annual costs of the renewables target is a staggering £ 9billion , according to the report abandoning renewables and going back to a market system would save around £ 6billion a year , or around £ 214 for every household , he says			1
but professor @entity113 , professor of energy policy at the @entity115 said the report ‘ downplays climate change as a problem ’			0
she said : ‘ what is needed is an electricity market that is constructed to best integrate renewable energy and energy efficiency for the benefit of customers , the environment and security			2
’ last month , energy secretary @entity126 announced £ 4billion in new energy deals for wind and solar schemes			2
it means a guarantee for some 27 new renewable energy projects that they can sell their power at a fixed price until 2040			2
the subsidised schemes include 15 onshore wind farms , five solar arrays , two offshore wind programmes and five waste conversion plants			0
it will be paid for by householders through their electricity bills with a subsidy added to the basic cost of electricity			0
a spokesman for the @entity148 said : ‘ we are dealing with a legacy of underinvestment to safeguard people ’s electricity supplies now and in the years ahead			0
‘ the government ’s electricity market reforms are designed to attract up to £ 100 billion of capital investment that we will need in the sector over the next decade			0
by creating the world ’s first low carbon electricity market , we are going green at the lowest cost , and attracting tens of billions of pounds of infrastructure investment , creating huge numbers of green jobs			0

shifting to wind and solar power has increased costs to consumers
ditching green energy targets would save households £ 214 a year
report into renewable energy carried out by @entity176
found the rush to go green has been the ' most expensive policy disaster '
say no @entity3 government has carried out analysis of costs vs benefits
annual cost of renewable target is said to be a staggering £ 9 billion
