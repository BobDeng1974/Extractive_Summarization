dna analysis confirmed remains found in car park in 2012 were @entity6 ’s
@entity6 ’s coffin leaves @entity112 for @entity29 in a black @entity114 **hearse** , ***escorted*** by four *police* *out*riders** and *limousines* , to start the *preliminary* leg of its journey . the *oak* coffin was made by @entity25 , @entity6 ’s nephew 17 times removed , whose family ’s dna was used to identify the @entity124 ’s skeleton .
the bones have been packed in wool and @entity6 ’s hands and feet have been placed in linen bags , embroidered with roses by *chil*dr*en* at @entity10 ’s @entity133 . with the @entity124 is a *wooden* rosary , *emblazoned* with an *enamelled* @entity135 . the skeleton is covered by a *raw* linen cloth , embroidered with @entity139 roses , by @entity140 , of the @entity141 .
the ******cortege****** officially departs @entity145 farm . close to @entity29 , this is where the battle was actually fought on *august* *22* , 1485 . here @entity6 lost his crown and his life , when his army of *8,000* men was beaten by the @entity153 , led by @entity46 . *archaeologists* found more than 20 ******medieval****** *cannon* balls on the site .
the ******cortege****** will be joined by two ***knightly*** figures on *horseback* in 15th *century* ****armour**** . they **include** *dr* @entity162 , curator of arms and ****armour**** at the @entity165 .
@entity6 ’s body arrives at @entity168 at @entity169 for **prayers** . here many of the dead of @entity29 are buried . @entity46 paid for a *chancery* in the *church* .
following the ******cortege****** is the 19th @entity58 , descendant of @entity58 , @entity6 ’s lord high constable of @entity13 . he *swung* the battle by changing sides to support @entity46 , with his *3,000* men . @entity6 *miscalculated* @entity58 ’s **loyalty** *****–***** *surprising* since @entity58 was *married* to @entity46 ’s *mother* . ‘ @entity58 had by far the largest army on the field , ’ said @entity58 . ‘ but he was in a very *difficult* position . the pillow talk was all about helping @entity46 . @entity6 took @entity58 ’s *eldest* *son* *hostage* and *threatened* to kill him . but @entity58 said , **“** @entity186 , i have other *son*s . **”** *luckily* , @entity6 never got the chance to *behead* him . ’
after the battle , @entity58 *retrieved* @entity6 ’s crown from a hedge and crowned @entity46 on the ***battlefield*** . @entity46 *rewarded* him by making him @entity58 , calling him ‘ right *dearly* *beloved* *father* ’ .
lord @entity58 is one of the ten ‘ @entity40 peers ’ , whose ancestors fought at the battle , who will follow the coffin later today .
the ******cortege****** stops at @entity168 ’ @entity206 , @entity207 , where @entity6 heard his last @entity208 before battle . while his army camped the night before the battle on @entity212 , above @entity213 , the @entity124 is said to have spent his last night on earth at @entity215 , which no longer exists .
among the @entity77 will be @entity73 , of @entity75 ’s documentary @entity6 : the @entity76 . by an *enormous* *coincidence* , @entity73 also suffers from **scoliosis** , the curvature of the spine that led @entity*22*2 to call @entity6 ‘ a poi*son*ous , bunch - backed toad ’ .
@entity73 learned to ride and fight in a specially made suit of ****armour**** and proved @entity6 could have been the great *warrior* of repute and that his **scoliosis** was hardly *apparent* when *clothed* .
@entity6 arrives at the @entity230 where the coffin will be transferred to a wheeled bier . covered with @entity6 ’s @entity234 , ***escorted*** by the two ***knightly*** *riders* , it will be d*raw*n to the top of @entity212 for a *****service***** of *commemoration* .
as well as ***invited*** @entity77 , more than *2,000* ***people*** have *bought* tickets for the *event* . ***battlefield*** *re-enactment* *society* ***members*** will have held a dawn vigil in ******medieval****** *dr*ess . there will be *exhibitions* of ******medieval****** *warfare* , *falconry* , cooking and other aspects of ******medieval****** life . there will be a minute ’s *silence* , then a 21 - **gun** salute from eight ******medieval****** *cannon*s . ‘ it ’s about **reconciliation** for the dead of both sides , ’ said the @entity230 ’s @entity257 . ‘ and to allow @entity6 to return from the ***battlefield*** with the *dignity* and honour that he was *denied* in 1485 . ’
the @entity265 will be lit *****–***** and it will burn until @entity6 is buried .
the coffin is transferred back to his **hearse** . the ***knightly*** *out*riders** salute their king , as the *motorised* ***procession*** sets off for @entity10 . the ***procession*** follows the route @entity6 took in 1485 , through @entity40 , ***including*** crossing into @entity10 over @entity274 *****–***** over which @entity6 led his **troops** to battle . legend says his spur struck the bridge , and an old crone *prophesied* his head would hit the same stone .
on his return , @entity6 was slung naked over a horse , his hands tied together . legend says that his broken skull did hit the same stone on the bridge . trauma to his skeleton ’s *pelvic* bone showed that someone *stabbed* him in the bottom .
@entity6 ’s ***procession*** arrives back in @entity10 , over @entity274 , across which he led his **troops** *530* years *ago* . the coffin will be *transported* into the ******medieval****** @entity300 , where **prayers** will be said .
the coffin will then be transferred to a **gun** carriage d*raw*n by four black *horses* and *dr*iven by a *dr*iver in *traditional* *dr*ess .
*accompanying* them will be @entity310 , of *undertakers* @entity311 . ‘ we ’re not having *plumes* or *dr*apes , ’ says @entity310 . ‘ it ’s going to be simple . ***people*** said , **“** it ’s not going to look like the @entity318 , is it ? **”** ’ @entity6 ’s ******cortege****** will then make its way to @entity31 .
the remains of @entity13 ’s last @entity124 will arrive at @entity31 . his ******cortege****** , *flanked* by the two *knights* in ****armour**** , will be ***escorted*** into the cathe*dr*al by the ‘ @entity29 peers ’ .
the @entity135 of @entity139 peers are the 1*8th* of @entity330 , back from a family *skiing* *holiday* for the *occasion* ; the **6th** @entity333 ; the @entity334 ; the 19th @entity335 ; and the @entity336 , representing his *brother* , the 27th @entity337 .
the @entity340 peers are the @entity58 ; the **6th** @entity341 ; 29th @entity342 ; 11th @entity343 ; and representatives of the 1*8th* @entity345 and *8th* @entity346 . ‘ we ’ve got @entity349 and @entity135 , for @entity350 and @entity139 , because this *****service***** is about **reconciliation** , ’ said the @entity347 , the very *reverend* @entity348 .
the coffin will be borne by ***members*** of the @entity356 , ***including*** two senior ncos from the @entity359 @entity358 , @entity360 , and royal *warrant* officer first class from the @entity363 .
**original*ly* the @entity29 peers were going to carry the coffin *****–***** ‘ but it ’s lead - lined , so we thought it was too heavy , ’ said a cathe*dr*al *spokesman* . the sermon will be given by *cardinal* @entity370 , **archbishop** of *westminster* , as @entity6 was a @entity372 .
more than *14,000* ***people*** from all over the world *applied* for the ticket **ballot** for the *****service***** . the *600* - strong *congregation* is split between ***invited*** *guests* and the **ballot** *winners* . those attending will **include** @entity382 , @entity6 ’s @entity383 niece 17 times removed . her dna , along with @entity25 ’s , was used to identify the @entity124 .
@entity6 ’s remains in his coffin will lie in repose in the cathe*dr*al from today until thursday so that ***members*** of the *public* may *pay* their respects .
on thursday at 11am , @entity13 ’s last @entity124 will be *reburied* in a *****service***** conducted by the **archbishop** of @entity397 .

@entity6 will then be laid in a specially *dug* crypt in the centre of the cathe*dr*al , behind the altar . *overnight* , his tomb , designed by the *architects* @entity420 and @entity421 , will be constructed .
