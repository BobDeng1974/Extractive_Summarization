education : calls have been made for @entity3 pupils to be taught about pornography children as young as 11 are becoming addicted to internet pornography giving them ' unrealistic expectations ' of sex , according to new research			1
it is now ' common practice ' for schoolchildren to access hard core pornography at an early age and become desensitised to sexual images			1
a study , published by @entity17 , said that more children are finding themselves ' hooked ' on internet porn before they become sexually active , leading to problems in later life			1
the news comes as a teaching union said yesterday that children as young as ten should learn about pornography as part of the national curriculum			2
the @entity29 of @entity30 said primary school teachers needed to respond to the fact that children were now getting a large amount of their information about sex from the internet			1
they said sex education guidelines are hopelessly out of date and can not cope with the ‘ overtly sexualised world ’ in which children are now growing up			1
but many family campaigners will argue that teaching children about pornography could actually make the situation worse , because children could be introduced to the concept for the first time			2
campaigners say the easy access of porn online is harming children , and the @entity53 says they have seen an upsurge in calls from teenagers upset by what they have seen			2
however , another teaching union – the @entity59 – said it was too early to start teaching children about porn at primary school			1
the @entity64 is campaigning for an automatic block on web porn , with adults having to opt in if they want to access it			1
in an interview with @entity74 ’s @entity73 programme , @entity70 policy adviser @entity69 said teachers should hold lessons on the ‘ impact of pornography ’			0
‘ children are growing up in an overtly sexualised world , ’ he said			1
‘ that includes easy access to porn and they need the skills to deal with it			0
‘ we would support children being taught in an age - appropriate way about the impact of pornography as part of a statutory @entity94 programme			1
’ time for change : the @entity29 of @entity30 argue that pupils need to be taught about porn from the age of 10 because information is so easily accessible online mr @entity69 said that lessons could start from primary school but that the material would depend on age			1
‘ evidence suggests ten is n’t too young to start lessons on pornography , but it would n’t be a full - on lesson but the grounding would be laid down , ’ he said			0
at the moment , @entity94 , which includes sex and relationships education , is not compulsory in @entity111 , unlike other parts of the @entity113			2
biological facts are part of all lessons in secondary school science lessons			0
beyond that parents have the right to withdraw their children from any sex education			1
the @entity59 however disagreed with their union colleagues			2
they told the @entity74 that referring to issues of porn in lessons is a step too far , and that schools should only talk about it if asked by students			2
but @entity130 , from the charity family lives , said it was vital children learned about porn			2
she said that at a time when 90 per cent of children own a smartphone , it is no longer relevant to talk about ‘ making a baby ’			0
she said : ‘ teenagers are bombarded with pornography from a young age ; you ca n’t escape it			0
it ’s patronising to say they ca n’t cope with the lesson because they can			0
’ @entity149 , founder of website @entity150 , said mothers frequently panic when they come across porn on a computer at home and would welcome support from schools			0
she said : ‘ it can be a minefield			0
many do n’t know what to do or say			0
for example a single mother may struggle with teenage boys , a single father may not know how to approach the subject with his daughter			0
‘ in very traditional households , they might not even talk about sex at all			0
the ideal solution is for schools and parents to work together			0
’ the @entity172 would not comment on the @entity70 ’s suggestion , but told @entity73 that it is up to individual schools on how they teach sex education .			1

children are being given ' unrealistic expectations of sex ' through porn
@entity183 *warned* ' common practice ' for children to become desensitised to sexual images after accessing porn at an early age
