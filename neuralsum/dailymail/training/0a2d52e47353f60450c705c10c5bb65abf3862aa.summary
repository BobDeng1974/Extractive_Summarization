by @entity0 published : 04:25 est , 2 november 2012 updated : 09:18 est , 2 november 2012 this astonishing time - lapse video released by @entity2 shows just how @entity3 wreaked havoc across the @entity6 @entity5			0
the superstorm 's path was predicted almost exactly by the @entity9 - and this accurate forecast was critical to ensuring authorities knew which direction it would take			1
the centre , based in @entity14 , @entity15 , had an average error in its track forecast three days into the future for @entity3 of just 71 miles , which dropped to only 48 miles within two days of it hitting			1
the average in the past five years was 96 miles , reported the @entity33			2
the @entity9 correctly predicted by last thursday morning that southern @entity27 would be near the centre of @entity3 ’s track forecast - around 108 hours before it hit land			1
@entity37 of research group @entity38 said that @entity40 figures show track forecasts have improved by 50 per cent over the past 15 years			0
he added : ‘ during the period from 2003 to 2008 , the average storm track forecast had an error that was down to less than 200 miles at 72 hours , and less than 100 miles at 48 hours			1
’ burning : this aerial photo shows a fire in the wake of @entity3 in @entity48 on wednesday rebuild : a new break in the island across @entity51 at the @entity53 bridge in @entity54 , @entity27 wrecked : destruction in the wake of @entity3 on wednesday in @entity57 , @entity27 but the five - day forecast error margin for @entity59 , which hit @entity60 in august , was 253 miles - above the modern - day average of 245 - although it was only 70 miles out with 48 hours to go			1
and storm intensity forecasts have not progressed like track forecasts over recent years , because computer models still have problems capturing small - scale details such as air mass characteristics			2
@entity3 was blamed for at least 98 deaths in the @entity6 and @entity69 , and left @entity27 's barrier islands a wasteland of eroded shoreline , ruined beachfront homes , flooded streets and damaged utilities			2
as @entity77 came back to life yesterday , starting with the partial reopening of subway routes three days after the storm , it was revealed the total @entity6 damage could hit $ 50billion ( £ 31billion )			0
this would make it the second - costliest storm in @entity6 history after @entity87			0
warnings also rose again over global warming and the prospect of more similar severe weather to come			0

@entity9 's work was critical to expectations of storm path
@entity14 - based centre had track forecast three days into future of just 71 miles
this is compared to average error of 518 miles in 1970 and 345 miles in 1990
@entity9 knew by last thursday that southern @entity27 would be near centre
