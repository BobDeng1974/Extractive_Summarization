by @entity0 published : 11:05 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 01:52 est , 2 may 2013 tough : companies put up prices for the majority to help pay for green solutions for the poorest and oldest in society , but now face fines for not spending the cash energy giants that are failing to help thousands of poor families and pensioners cut their bills face huge fines			1
millions of households saw bills increase on the promise that companies would use the extra money to pay for home insulation , double glazing and new boilers			1
however , a number , including @entity23 and @entity24 , took the money but failed to carry out all the work that was expected			1
the idea was to cut the @entity29 ’s carbon emissions by helping the poor to reduce their energy use			0
under the @entity32 and @entity33 , each major energy supplier and generator was given targets in terms of the number of homes that would be improved			0
all the work was due to be completed by last december			2
as a result of the missed deadline hundreds of thousands of homes have not had the help expected to cut energy use			2
industry regulator @entity46 yesterday said the firms involved face enforcement action – likely to include multi-million - pound fines			1
executive director of the consumer champion which ? , @entity52 , welcomed the crackdown , saying : ‘ it 's right that @entity46 is taking action against those energy companies who have not met their energy efficiency targets			1
‘ consumers pay for these schemes through their energy bills , and so have a right to know how much they are costing			2
’ requirements to make millions of homes more energy efficient were established under two schemes , @entity32 – @entity32 – and @entity33 – @entity33			0
the idea was that these would cut the @entity29 ’s carbon emissions by helping the poor to reduce their energy use and bills			0
each major energy supplier and generator was given specific targets in terms of the number of homes that would be improved and the resulting cut in carbon emissions			0
the @entity32 scheme involved insulating homes , switching the energy supply from oil to gas or paying for free energy displays to encourage people to cut down on use of heat and light			2
the work would save 293million tonnes of carbon emissions , which was the equivalent to insulating 11.5m homes			0
improvements : the money raised from higher prices was meant to be used to pay for new boilers , insulation and other greener energy products the @entity33 scheme encouraged the firms to form partnerships with local councils and housing associations to support major schemes that would transform entire estates			1
this involved replacing old inefficient boilers , providing solid wall insulation or green energy through , for example , solar panels			1
all the work was due to be completed by december last year , however , @entity23 , the country ’s biggest household supplier failed to meet the targets			1
in terms of @entity33 , it only reached 62.4per cent of its obligations , while the figure was 98.9per cent for the @entity32 scheme			0
earlier this year , the company revealed an 11per cent rise in profits to £ 606million for 2012			0
this helped its parent company , @entity128 , to post a 14per cent rise in profits to £ 2.7billion			0
@entity131 only met 70per cent of its @entity33 target			0
@entity24 managed a score of 90.9per cent on @entity33 and 98.5per cent on @entity134 hot water : @entity23 is among the companies facing punishment from the energy watchdog a number of electricity generating firms also failed badly to hit @entity33 targets , including the giant @entity143 power station , in north @entity144 , at just 37.1per cent , and @entity147 / @entity146 , which has seven power plants , at 38.6per cent			1
the worst performing firm was @entity151 , which runs three power stations in @entity153 , which met just 6.5per cent of the target it was given to help families improve their home energy efficiency			0
the net result of the collective failure is that hundreds of thousands of homes have not had the help expected to cut energy use and so lower bills			0
@entity164 , @entity165 , said millions of people have been helped by the schemes , which have now been replaced by what he said was a new tougher regime			0
however , he said : ‘ i am disappointed that under the old schemes , some companies failed to meet their obligations			0
‘ @entity46 will be conducting a thorough investigation and will take any necessary enforcement action			1
we are already acting through the @entity177 to give @entity46 the teeth it needs in future to get compensation to those directly affected			1
’ @entity46 ’s enforcement chief , @entity182 , said : ‘ at a time of rising energy bills energy efficiency can make a big difference for consumers			2
‘ @entity46 ’s role is to ensure that consumers do not lose out by the failure of firms to deliver all the help required or are not disadvantaged by late delivery			1
’ @entity194 said it has spent £ 1.1billion on home insulation and energy efficiency measures under the @entity32 and @entity33 schemes			1
this paid for the insulation of three million homes and 65,000 new boilers			2
it blamed the bad weather over the winter for not being able to carry out as many home improvements as it would have liked			0
@entity131 said that while it did not meet the december 2012 deadline , it has contracts in place to ensure the promised insulation and other measures are carried out			2
@entity24 said it did complete all the work that was expected , but was unable to provide the necessary verification in time .			1

prices went up to pay for free home insulation , double glazing and boilers
but some companies never carried out the work that was expected
@entity23 and @entity24 among the firms facing huge fines from @entity46
