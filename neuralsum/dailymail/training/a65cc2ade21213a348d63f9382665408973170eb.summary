this awe - inspiring image shows @entity2 's @entity1 as it drives across the red planet and was taken by the @entity5 satellite - 200 miles above the surface			1
the car - sized robotic rover and the tracks it makes as it drives on the surface of the alien planet , 34 million miles away from @entity7 , are clearly visible in this view from orbit , acquired on april 11 by the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) camera on @entity2 's orbiter , the largest ever carried on a deep space mission			1
scientists are using @entity2 's @entity1 to probe a rock layer surrounding the base of a small butte ( an isolated hill with steep sides ) called ' @entity26 '			1
orbital : this @entity2 image shows the @entity1 as it drives across the red planet and was taken by the @entity5 satellite @entity31 : a close up of the rover 's tyre tracks , clearly visible from orbit it may be a potential target for investigating using tools on the rover 's robotic arm			1
@entity1 's science team refers to the rock layer surrounding the base of @entity26 , which is about five metres high , as the ' middle unit ' because its location is intermediate between rocks that form buttes in the area and lower - lying rocks that show a pattern of striations - a series of ridges , furrows or linear marks			1
depending on what the mission scientists learn from a close - up look at the rock and identification of chemical elements in it , a site on this middle unit may become the third rock that @entity1 samples with its drill			1
the rover carries laboratory instruments to analyse rock powder collected by the drill			2
the mission 's first two drilled samples , in an area called @entity75 near @entity1 's landing site , yielded evidence last year for an ancient lakebed environment with available energy and ingredients favourable for microbial life			2
eye in the sky : the image was taken by the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) camera on @entity2 's orbiter @entity2 's @entity1 used its @entity86 ( @entity87 ) to record this scene of a butte called ' @entity26 ' and surrounding outcrops at a waypoint called ' the @entity92 ' inside @entity93 curiosity has been operational on @entity95 since august 2012 and is entering a key science phase of the mission the rover 's current location , where multiple types of rocks are exposed close together , is called ' the @entity92 '			1
here and , later , at outcrops on the slope of @entity105 inside @entity93 , researchers plan to use @entity1 's science instruments to learn more about habitable past conditions and environmental changes			0
@entity2 's @entity109 , a division of @entity110 in @entity111 , manages the @entity112 for @entity2 's @entity113 in @entity114			0
the project designed and built curiosity and operates the rover on @entity95			1
last week @entity2 spoke out on the controversy surrounding a strange ' glow ' spotted on @entity95 - and says it is either a shiny rock or a glitch in the @entity1 's camera			1
@entity122 ? in this photo taken by the @entity1 a light of unknown origin can be seen in the distance @entity128 blogger @entity127 claimed that the new photograph taken by the rover suggests there are intelligent creatures living underground			0
however , @entity2 investigated the image and found it was simply a trick of the light			0
' one possibility is that the light is the glint from a rock surface reflecting the sun , ' a @entity2 spokesperson told @entity141			0
' when these images were taken each day , the sun was in the same direction as the bright spot , west - northwest from the rover , and relatively low in the sky			2
' the rover science team is also looking at the possibility that the bright spots could be caused by cosmic rays striking the camera 's detector			2
' @entity2 's engineers believe the glow may have been caused by sunlight reaching the camera 's sensors through a vent hole in the camera housing			0
the rover 's top speed is 1.5 inches ( 3.8 centimetres ) per second			0
curiosity is the fourth rover to visit @entity95			1
it took around seven minutes to land on the @entity95			2
the rover is fitted with 17 cameras			0
it weighs about the same as a @entity169 at approximately 2,000lb ( 900kg )			0
scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on @entity93 .			0

image was snapped using high - tech camera 200 miles above the red planet
it shows the rover and its tracks around the base of a small hill
scientists are probing the area looking for signs of life on @entity95
