by @entity0 published : 10:18 est , 27 july 2013 updated : 02:56 est , 28 july 2013 they are instantly recognisable - iconic photographs that immediately prompt the viewer to remember classic @entity5 films			2
@entity6 is immediately obvious by the scene of @entity8 spread across a bed of roses , while most would automatically think of the blockbuster matrix when they see @entity11 clad in a long leather coat while spinning through the air			1
but now two talented photographers have transformed these @entity5 images by giving them an @entity17 makeover			1
the idea behind the @entity20 series is to pay tribute to iconic moments of cinema which have highly influenced the two talented photographers @entity8 in @entity6 , shot in 1999 , made an impact on the photographer duo , who wanted to pay homage to cinema that influence them @entity30 , who is @entity31 , teamed up with @entity34 - @entity33 photographer @entity32 to create @entity20 - a fresh perspective of classic photographs using @entity17 models and slightly different details			1
instead of a bed of roses for the @entity6 scene , lush green plants were used to cover the model 's modesty			1
breakfast in @entity45 's has an @entity17 model pulling the same coy smile , but wearing a white dress instead of @entity50 's classic black one			2
the glittering jewellery , cigarette holders and scattered tea things on the table has been lovingly recreated			2
the scene of @entity56 , where @entity57 and @entity58 stare into the distance while police cars can be seen approaching them in the distance			2
the scene is given a fresh twist in the project , with the same dusty background used , and the defiant - looking models gaze through the windscreen , just as the actresses did in the 1991 film , which also starred @entity71			2
the have headscarves wrapped around their heads , echoing the costumes used in the film			2
but it is a motel , instead of a group of police officers , that looms behind the models			2
the 1966 thriller @entity81 also features in the project , with the new photographs mimicking the scenes that film fans know and love			0
just like @entity89 , an actor kneels over an actress who is splayed across the floor , apparently dead , as he takes a photograph of her			0
@entity93 , the film based on the @entity96 artist and starring @entity97 , is recreated by the pair of photographers - complete with @entity101 's famously bushy eyebrows according to @entity102 , @entity30 said of his collaboration with photographer @entity32 to recreate the stunning shots : ' i wanted to imagine what these movies would look like if they were conceived and shot in @entity109			1
' we started working with the movies we liked , the movies that had influenced us			1
' i remember watching in the 1980s the same movies as the young people of @entity115 and @entity116 and maybe @entity117			0
the two @entity119 - based photographers recreated the @entity121 scene where @entity11 defies physics to contort his body to swerve a bullet strike a pose ! @entity11 ' pose was perfectly recreated in the shot , but given a green tint to give it a fresh perspective @entity56 is given a fresh look in this shot , as the two models stare into the distance , just like the original stars did @entity57 starred as @entity135 and @entity58 took on the role of @entity137 in the famous 1991 film ' at the end of the day we 're all the same young people regardless of where you were born and where you were raised and somehow i wanted to show this also through the choice of movies in the series			1
@entity30 is a @entity31 photographer whose extensive work ranges from fashion photography to conceptual projects			1
he offers a new perspective on contemporary @entity17 aesthetics , his @entity153 page says			0
@entity30 has earned a reputation as a rising name in his hometown scene , @entity156 reported			1
the hairstyle , outfit and coy smile mimic breakfast at @entity45 - made famous by @entity50 the 1966 thriller @entity81 is given a fresh look here , as @entity165 and @entity30 wanted to conceive of a @entity5 if it had been @entity109 - based the film starred @entity89 , who starred alongside @entity167 as a photographer who believes he may have witnessed a murder and unwittingly taken photographs of the killing though his work has been featured at exhibitions around the world , it was not until the success of his first conceptual project , @entity178 in 2011 that he retired from a career in corporate communications in order to focus on photography			1
@entity32 is a @entity34 - @entity33 photographer who documents contemporary @entity17 cultural scenes through photojournalism and portraiture			1
he currently lives and works in @entity119 , @entity31			0
it is no wonder that the duo turned to @entity190 films for their inspiration			0
the @entity31 film scene is a relatively small industry			0
it has produced just five feature films in the last decade			0
the artists had a long history and a variety of movies to choose from if they picked @entity5 productions - whereas the first @entity31 film was only made in 1955			1
it was not until the @entity203 in june , 1960 , that the @entity17 country 's industry began to develop			0
the 1970s is often considered to be the golden years ' for the industry			0
production flourished and a variety of award - winning films were made			0
but by 1980 , despite the country producing five full length films a year and numerous short films - no mean feat considering it had just a handful of directors and professionals to create such works - the industry began to collapse			0
@entity219 became a crippling issue - the country could not provide the domestic resources and finance needed to help the industry flourish , and people could not afford to keep making the films			0
foreign funding was needed to produce the films , and instead of the movies being premiered in @entity31 , they would have been expected to be shown abroad instead			0
@entity97 and @entity230 starred in the biopic of the famous artist , who became known for her self - portraits , and the new photograph paid homage to the film ( left )			1
