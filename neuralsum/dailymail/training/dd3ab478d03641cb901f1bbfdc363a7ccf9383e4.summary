alternatively , five minutes in a hot oven will also give them back some crunch			0
hard loaves of bread can be zapped in the microwave , too — wrap in a slightly damp paper towel and heat for ten seconds , or until the loaf feels soft again			0
you can also pop stale cake slices in the microwave for 20 seconds to restore their normal texture			0
dry slices of bread can be cut into small squares and baked in the oven to make croutons			0
sprinkle the cubes with olive oil and season with salt and pepper or dried herbs , then place them into a hot oven and cook until they brown off and all moisture from the bread has evaporated			1
they are best used straight away , sprinkled on soups			0
old bread slices can also be tossed in a food processor to make breadcrumbs for coating fish or meat , or you can add herbs and use the crumbs in stuffing recipes			1
@entity68 make the most out of your left over double cream and turn it into butter ! stuck with a large pot of double cream nearing its use - by date ? @entity77 , one of @entity79 ’s top cookery writers , suggests a surprisingly easy recipe for turning it into lovely , creamy , home - made butter			1
beat the cream with an electric mixer for five to seven minutes until it separates into a mix of solid butterfat globules ( curds ) and liquid buttermilk ( whey )			1
separate the curds from the whey over a big bowl using a sieve			0
beat the curds again for a few minutes and sieve to ensure you have removed all the liquid			2
cover the curds with very cold water and squeeze to get the last dregs of whey out			0
drain and wash twice more with cold water before shaping into a ball or slab			0
put your butter on a sheet of greaseproof paper and roll up ready for use			2
it can be frozen , too			2
scrape your jars add olive oil to a mayonnaise jar to create a delicious creamy salad dressing do n’t waste those last scrapings of spreads and condiments in the bottom of glass jars			1
add a little olive oil , vinegar and herbs to an almost empty mayonnaise jar , replace the lid and give it a shake to create a delicious , creamy salad dressing			1
a few slugs of olive oil added to a smeary pesto jar will create a delicious dressing , or give you basil - flavoured oil to add to your cooking			1
and warm milk poured into a @entity137 jar and shaken will turn chocolate spread smears into a bedtime drink			0
@entity140 freeze your unused , clean and chopped veg , wait until the bag is full , boil and blitz it for some delicious soup keep a large plastic bag in the freezer and throw in rinsed and chopped vegetable ‘ leftovers ’			1
once the bag is full , defrost these leftovers , then add a cooked onion , garlic , water and herbs			2
boil for 20 minutes and then strain to make a stock or liquidise to make a soup			0
both can be used immediately or frozen in one pint portions until needed			2
@entity159 grate a freeze your leftover cheese to give it a longer shelf life , it tends to crumble in the freezer so use it on top of pasta or for a cheese sauce found more cheese than you can eat in your fridge ? grate and freeze it to extend its shelf life			1
cheese tends to turn crumbly in the freezer , so use it over pasta and in cheese sauces or quiches once thawed			0
@entity182 @entity181 snip the bottom of the herb 's stalks and put them in a small vase of water to extend their shelf life do n’t put packs of fresh herbs or bunches of watercress in the fridge			1
extend their life by snipping off the bottom centimetre of the stalks as soon as you get them home and placing them in a glass or small vase of fresh water — just like fresh flowers — on the kitchen counter			0
change the water every couple of days and they ’ll last for weeks			0
alternatively , you can invest in a @entity212 ( £ 27.80 , @entity213 )			0

freeze red or white wine in an ice cube tray and use them in stews or sauces for extra flavour store onions in your tights tie up onions in a pair of old tights for easy storage and to extend their lifespan tie onions individually into the legs of an old but clean pair of tights ( tie a knot in the tights between each one ) , then hang them up in a cool , dry , well - ventilated spot to extend the vegetables ’ lifespan			1
know your @entity260 frozen banana pieces can be blended together with milk for a delicious milkshake one minute your bananas are a bit too green to eat , the next time you look they ’ve turned brown and unappetising			1
of course , you can use overripe ones to make banana bread , but otherwise you can simply chop them up and freeze for later use			2
frozen banana pieces blended with milk make a delicious milkshake , or you can just process the frozen pieces on their own to make a healthy ‘ ice cream ’			2
@entity277 pop a kitchen towel in with your salad to soak up excess moisture and keep it fresher for longer bagged salad leaves are one of our worst vices when it comes to food wastage			1
pop a folded , paper kitchen towel in the bag before you reseal it ; this will absorb excess moisture and keep the leftover salad fresh for longer			2
keep as much of your cucumber as you can covered in its plastic cover			0
according to the @entity297 , shrink - wrapped cucumber will stay fresh up to three times longer than the unwrapped version			1
wrapping celery in aluminium foil and storing it in the fridge will keep it crisp for a minimum of two weeks			0
foil works with celery because it preserves the vegetable ’s moisture , but — because it ’s not an airtight seal like cling film — allows any ethylene , the gas that causes fruit and veg to ripen and then rot , to escape			2

fruit and @entity341 ( £ 4.99 for three , nigelsecostore.com ) when placed in salad drawers and fruit bowls , the discs absorb some of the ethylene — the gas fruit and veg emit as they ripen and which speeds up the rotting process			2
the @entity350 ( £ 5.99 , nigelsecostore.com ) this provides the exact amount of insulation and air needed to stop the flesh over-ripening			0
keeps a small bunch fresh and firm for around a fortnight — twice the usual lifespan			0
