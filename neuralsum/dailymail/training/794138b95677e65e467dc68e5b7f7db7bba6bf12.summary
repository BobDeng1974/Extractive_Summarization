the capital has seen several days of crazy clothing both on and off the catwalks as some of the world 's best designers showcase their wares during @entity7			1
but fittingly , one of the most bizarre shows of the week came right at the end of the style event - with a show by @entity13			1
the @entity15 designer hosted one of the most jaw - dropping collections at the @entity18 earlier today			1
the ghoulish - looking models had most of their features completely hidden by the shiny oils , which were then accessorised with black facial jewels			1
in contrast , the final model sent down the catwalk was painted in a bright white			0
@entity13 told @entity40 that his inspiration for the theme of the show came from the outside world , saying : ' i was inspired by nature , birds , skeletons and architecture			1
' i worked with sculptures for this collection and jewelry design			0
it was how i created the pieces with latex and leather			2
' @entity13 covered models in black paint and black facial jewels at the end of the show , he set down a single model covered from head to toe in white paint the designs were inspired by birds and architecture while his collection was based on many different influences , @entity13 's choice to paint the models in black came simply down to his tastes in colour			1
he said : ' i chose to do the whole collection in black because it 's my favourite colour			0
[ this collection ] is about celebrating life in a weird way , i do not believe it 's dark - it 's about something mystical , not about something that is negative			0
' @entity13 also revealed that the reason behind finishing the show with a model painted in white was simply because it contrasted with the other models			2
he said : ' the last collection closed the show with someone using only white , so i decided to do the same this season			0
' @entity13 hoped to create a mystical allure using the black body paint only a few of the models were free to walk down the catwalk without any body paint the @entity15 designer is known for creating sculptural and theatrical creations the @entity104 - based fashion maven , whose designs have been worn by the likes of @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 , is known for his sculptural and theatrical creations			1
his biggest celebrity fan though , is @entity114 , who even wore the designer 's creations on her @entity118 world tour			0
@entity114 's ex-stylist @entity120 saw his collection at @entity7 in 2009 and got in contact to ask if he would help with costumes for a photoshoot they were doing for @entity126 , the partnership then grew from there			2
@entity13 told lanciatrendvisions.com : ' @entity120 saw my collection and asked me to make costumes for @entity114 ’s shoot for @entity133			2
' then we did some more costumes for interludes of her @entity118 , as well as for her @entity138 and many other projects			0
' @entity114 ’s influence in fashion definitely helped me in getting bigger international exposure , but it 's also thanks to her team			0
' the single white model was designed to create a contrast among the women painted in black a huge team of stylists and make - up artists were on hand to create the bizarre catwalk looks adding the jewels and make - up took hours for each model many of the models had their features obscured by the dark paint			1
