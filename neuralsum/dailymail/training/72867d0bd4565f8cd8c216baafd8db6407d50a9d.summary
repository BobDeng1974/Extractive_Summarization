the @entity1 rover curiosity has completed its first chemical test of soil from the red planet , and scientists say there are no surprises so far			2
the spacecraft is on a mission to look for ingredients in @entity1 soil and rocks that could support life			2
but in the first scoop of soil analyzed , there were no definitive signs of the chemical building blocks of life			1
the scoops taken by @entity21 in @entity22 ' we have no definitive detection of @entity1 organics at this point , but we will keep looking in the diverse environments of @entity22 , ' said sam principal investigator @entity28 of @entity30 's @entity29			1
instead , the six - wheel rover detected water and a mix of other chemicals			1
the findings were reported at a meeting of the @entity36 meeting in @entity37			0
a comment by mission 's chief scientist two weeks ago led to speculation that @entity21 had dug up carbon - based organics , considered an essential ingredient for life			1
the @entity21 's instruments have found signs of organic compounds on @entity1 - but @entity30 has refused to confirm they were not taken there by the rover			1
' you have to be careful about what you say and how you say it , ' said @entity30 's @entity53			1
' the enthusiasm we had was just misunderstood , ' he admitted			1
' we 're doing science at the speed of science in a world that goes at the speed of @entity61			0
' a closeup of the martian soil sent back by the rover the finding comes as @entity30 's @entity21 has used its full array of instruments to analyze @entity1 soil for the first time , and found a complex chemistry within the @entity1 soil			1
water and sulfur and chlorine - containing substances , among other ingredients , showed up in samples @entity21 's arm delivered to an analytical laboratory inside the rover			2
the sample came from a drift of windblown dust and sand called ' @entity82			0
' the site lies in a relatively flat part of @entity22 still miles away from the rover 's main destination on the slope of a mountain called @entity89			0
the rover 's laboratory includes the @entity92 at @entity1 ( @entity94 ) suite and the @entity97 ( @entity96 ) instrument			0
@entity94 used three methods to analyze gases given off from the dusty sand when it was heated in a tiny oven			0
one class of substances @entity94 checks for is organic compounds -- carbon - containing chemicals that can be ingredients for life			1
@entity94 tentatively identified the oxygen and chlorine compound perchlorate , a reactive chemical previously found in arctic @entity1 soil by @entity30 's @entity112			1
reactions with other chemicals heated in @entity94 formed chlorinated methane compounds -- one - carbon organics that were detected by the instrument			1
the chlorine is of @entity1 origin , but it is possible the carbon may be of @entity123 origin , carried by @entity21 and detected by @entity94 's high sensitivity design			0
the five scoops taken by @entity21 and analysed by the rover @entity21 's team selected @entity82 as the first scooping site because it has fine sand particles suited for scrubbing interior surfaces of the arm 's sample - handling chambers			2
@entity133 was vibrated inside the chambers to remove residue from @entity123			0
@entity137 close - up images of @entity82 show a dust - coated crust one or two sand grains thick , covering dark , finer sand			2
' active drifts on @entity1 look darker on the surface , ' said @entity137 principal investigator @entity143 , of @entity144 in @entity145			2
' this is an older drift that has had time to be inactive , letting the crust form and dust accumulate on it			0
' @entity96 's examination of @entity82 samples found the composition is about half common volcanic minerals and half non-crystalline materials such as glass			0
' we used almost every part of our science payload examining this drift , ' said @entity162 scientist @entity53 of the @entity163 in @entity164			0
' the synergies of the instruments and richness of the data sets give us great promise for using them at the mission 's main science destination on @entity89			0
' where @entity30 's @entity21 has driven since landing at a site subsequently named ' @entity175 , ' and traveling to an overlook position near ' @entity177 , ' in drives totaling 1,703 feet			1

officials had promised finding ' for the *history* books ' - but say their enthusiasm was misunderstood
@entity30 researchers say ' no definitive detection ' of organic compounds on the surface , but find *tantalising* hints in could be there
