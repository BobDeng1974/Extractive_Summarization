the clip provided by @entity18 provides no context for the statement , but the publication 's accompanying story claims @entity2 made the comment while watching a tape of their recent debate , and the @entity2 campaign has not refuted it			1
in a longer clip @entity2 refers to a woman who came up to her at an event and said she worked for for the state 's @entity48 and claimed to be a cabinet - level official			1
' what the hell is that ? ' @entity2 asks			0
after her deputy campaign manager confirms the position to her , @entity2 reiterates her confusion about the purpose of the position			2
' i just do n't know what they do			0
i understand that we have ten cabinet positions , more than the federal government , but some of these seem to be in name only , ' she says			0
' i do n't get what the hell does a position on women 's cabinet do all day long ? ' ' but she sure was my best friend all day long , ' @entity2 adds , laughing , at which point the male deputy campaign manager makes a joke about another male campaign adviser wanting to be appointed to the commission so that he can study women			1
' oh , s * * * , ' @entity2 responds , still laughing			1
in this aug. 19 , 2010 file photo , gubernatorial candidates @entity33 , left , and @entity2 , right , prepare to square off during a @entity3 gubernatorial debate			1
in this historic race @entity3 elected its first female governor in the audio recordings a @entity2 adviser says that former @entity3 house speaker @entity84 sounds like a ' retard ' when he speaks in @entity26			1
@entity84 is pictured here in feb. 18 , 2010			0
he passed away in 2012 @entity2 's deputy campaign manager can also be heard in another clip making fun of the state 's former speaker of the house , @entity84			1
' somebody told me he 's absolutely eloquent in @entity94 , but his @entity26 ? he sounds like a retard			1
' @entity84 passed away in 2012 after a battle with cancer			0
@entity18 is the publication responsible for releasing the infamous ' 47 percent ' video that irreparably damaged former @entity102 governor @entity101 's 2012 presidential bid			2
the audio clips @entity18 released of @entity2 were part of a longer profile the publication published framing @entity2 as ' nasty , juvenile , and vindictive			1
' the article 's author , @entity107 , likens @entity2 to ' brash , ' embattled @entity110 governor @entity109			2
@entity2 , a @entity111 who is up for reelection this year , and her advisers seem unfazed by the recordings , however			2
in a statement posted on @entity2 's campaign website , spokesman @entity116 played @entity120 's article and its release of the recordings off as ' cheap political attacks , ' as well as an attempt to ' smear ' @entity2 in order to undercut the @entity111 's standing with @entity8			1
' today , an extreme left - wing blog posted four - year - old material from private conversations undoubtedly sent to them by individuals or their allies who are either under federal indictment , or have had their homes raided by the @entity135 for their role in stealing or distributing governor @entity138 € ™ s email , ' @entity116 wrote			0
' that the national @entity139 is trying to smear the first @entity8 woman governor in @entity142 history because they view her as a threat is about as surprising as the @entity144 reporting that @entity145 is still alive			0
' the statement goes on to snarkily address the governor 's use of the b - word in the recordings			2
' yes , the governor used salty language in a private conversation four years ago with close advisers and will pay the appropriate penalty to the cuss jar			0
' a strategist familiar with the campaign 's thinking predicted that the recordings would actually help @entity2 in her governor 's race			2
' people actually want a tough governor , ' the source said , adding that @entity3 is still a ' @entity166 ' of sorts and that the ' machismo ' spirit is rewarded there			0
' strong women advance in politics , ' the strategist continued			0
' she is a woman , and she can kind of get away with that more			0
' ' people want her to do well			0
people look at her and want her to stand up and fight			0
' the strategist admitted that what the campaign 's adviser said about @entity84 was ' crazy , but its certainly not a @entity178 ' in its article on @entity2 , @entity18 likens the @entity3 governor 's behavior in the secret recordings to that of embattled @entity110 governor @entity109			1
a source close to @entity2 rejected that comparison , saying the recordings are no ' @entity178 ' @entity178 is the scandal afflicting @entity109 's adminstration in which the governor 's staff took retribution on a political foe by closing lanes on a major bridge in @entity110 , trapping cars on the bridge for hours			2
@entity2 has consistently had one of the highest approval ratings for a state leader since she took office			0
