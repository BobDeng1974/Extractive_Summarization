former prime minister @entity0 last night invoked the memory of his late baby daughter to ‘ nail the @entity4 lie ’ that @entity6 's health service is at risk of privatisation			1
mr @entity0 was close to tears as he made the personal plea , accusing @entity11 of misleading people over the issue , which he described as a ‘ @entity14 ’ in the independence referendum debate			1
the @entity4 has repeatedly argued that the only way to save the health service from privatisation in @entity6 is a @entity20 vote			1
mr @entity0 rarely speaks publicly about his family and is fiercely protective about any of his children appearing in public			1
the speech yesterday marks mr @entity0 's de-facto takeover of the ' no ' campaign from his former chancellor @entity44			1
anti-independence campaigners hope the former prime minister 's continuing respect in @entity6 could help convince wavering voters to urge on the side of caution and reject independence			0
mr @entity0 's vitriolic clashes with @entity53 in the run up to the 2010 general election may also help to neutralise the @entity4 claim that a ' no ' vote is a tick in the box for the @entity60			1
as well as invoking the memory of his late daughter , mr @entity0 also spoke about how his sight was saved after a rugby accident left him blind in one eye at the age of 16			1
the @entity67 and @entity68 mp said : ‘ i love @entity6 , i love the @entity24			2
i was born into the @entity24 , i grew up in the @entity24 , my family grew up in the @entity24			0
‘ when i lost the sight of my eye and faced the prospect of going blind , my sight was saved by the @entity24			0
‘ when my daughter died it was as the result of not being able , not being able , to do anything to save her life and my respect for the @entity24 grew as a result of the experience that @entity25 and i had			1
‘ do you think that i or anybody else who cares about the @entity24 would stand by and do nothing if we thought the @entity24 was going to be privatised in @entity6 and its funds were going to be cut ? would we stand back and do nothing without a fight ? of course not			2
‘ we created the @entity24 , we , not the @entity4 , built the @entity24 , we cherished the @entity24 , in @entity90 we took the pain of a tax rise to double the budget of the @entity24			2
‘ the only people who could put the @entity95 and the health service in @entity6 at risk is the @entity4 , not the @entity98			2
’ mr @entity0 outlined his plan on devolving more powers to the @entity6 parliament at @entity103 's @entity102 mr @entity0 , who will speak at 40 events in the days leading up to the referendum on september 18 , said it is time to ‘ nail the @entity4 lie ’			1
he said : ‘ the @entity24 can not be privatised if that 's not the will of the @entity6 people and the @entity6 health service will have the funding that 's necessary if that 's also the will of the @entity6 people			2
‘ our proposals for a @entity95 with more powers enhance the prospect for that funding over the next few years , without the disruption , the chaos and uncertainty and the loss that will occur if we break from the @entity122			0
’ the leaders of the three main pro-union parties have come together to pledge more powers for @entity6 if it rejects independence			0
mr @entity0 , who set out a proposed timetable for greater autonomy for @entity129 yesterday , said these additional powers would bring ‘ faster , fairer , safer and better ’ change			2
the @entity0 's ten - day - old daughter died in her parents arms three days after suffering a brain haemorrhage			1
the funeral ( pictured ) took place at @entity137 in @entity67 , @entity6 on january 11 , 2002 he said : ‘ the choice on september 18th is really between two different kinds of change			0
‘ the change sought by the nationalists - breaking all constitutional connections with our friends , neighbours and family in the rest of the @entity122 - places the dogma of independence over the needs and interests of the @entity6 people			0
‘ but the proposals supported by the pro-devolution parties offer faster change , fairer change , safer change and better change			0
it is the change that most of us want and change that brings @entity6 together			0
‘ we have now answered the question that the people of @entity6 had for us about the certainty of change within the @entity122			0
now it is time for @entity11 to answer the huge questions people have about independence			0

mr @entity0 's voice cracked as he spoke about his late baby daughter
@entity36 , the former @entity175 's first child , died from a brain haemorrhage in 2002
@entity4 claims only way to save @entity6 *nhs* from privatisation is a @entity20 vote
mr @entity0 said the @entity4 were the only danger to the @entity24 , not @entity183
