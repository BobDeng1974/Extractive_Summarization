experts have warned that more criminals are using websites to spark romances with strangers and then ask them for money			2
the racket has developed along with fake online auctions where web - users attempt to buy products online but are never sent their goods			0
some 229,000 frauds were recorded in the last year - up by 27 per cent on the 181,000 of the previous period , the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) said			1
it came as it was revealed that overall crime has fallen to its lowest level for 32 years despite there being 4,500 fewer police officers			1
down : official figures show that crime is down nine per cent in the past year , reaching the lowest level since records began manipulative : figures show frauds online , either involving dating or never sending goods , are on the rise online dating scams accounted for 1,212 of the frauds reported , while bogus internet auctions made up around 23,000 of the offences			1
the rise in fraud has been partially attributed to a change in the way data is collected			0
victims are now encouraged to report crimes to @entity44 , which acts as a central point of contact for help with financially - motivated internet crime , rather than visiting a local police station			0
@entity50 , of the @entity18 , said : ' the figures are showing that this is a new area of crime that is on the rise			1
' it is difficult to determine how much that is due to an increase in the prevalence of crime or an increase in publicity for @entity44			0
' rape and other sexual offences have gone up because more victims have come forward following the @entity66 scandal , according to the @entity18 ( @entity18 )			1
experts have called the ' @entity69 effect ' - in reference to the @entity72 investigation launched after the paedophile @entity73 's decades of abuse were revealed after his death			0
overall there were nine per cent fewer crimes in the year to march when compared to the previous 12 months			0
this drop to the lowest level since records began in 1981 , came despite deep cuts to police budgets and rank and file numbers , official figures show			1
most likely : this graph shows the most prevalent types of crimes committed in the 12 months to march 2013 but the number of reported rapes has risen by two per cent in the past year , with the increase thought to be linked to the knock - on effect of the @entity66 investigation			1

an additional one million offences - which are not included in the police figures - were dealt with by the courts in the year ending december 2012 , the @entity18 said			2
these cover less serious crimes such as speeding offences			0
shame : figures show that a significant number of households are victims of vandalism , theft and burglary picture : similar number have also been been victims of violent crime the @entity18 identified decreases across all the main categories of victim - based crime compared with the previous year , except for theft from the person , which went up nine per cent , and sexual offences which rose by 1 per overall , with a 2 per cent increase in rapes			1
this has been attributed to the police inquiry into historic sex attacks launched in the wake of the @entity152 scandal			0
' the latter increase is thought to be partly a " @entity69 effect " whereby greater numbers of victims of sexual offences have come forward to report historical offences to the police , ' the @entity18 said .			2

more criminals starting relationships online then ask them for cash
@entity18 says overall crime is down 9 % and recorded crime is down 7 %
this takes it to the lowest level since records began in 1981
but rapes up 2 % with experts saying it is linked to @entity66 scandal
