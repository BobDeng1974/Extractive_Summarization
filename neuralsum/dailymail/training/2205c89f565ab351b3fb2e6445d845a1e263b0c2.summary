this extraordinary looking skeleton looks more suited to a @entity2 movie than a @entity4 kitchen			1
the mysterious remains , which bear more than a passing resemblance to the terrifying creature in the @entity9 horror film , were discovered under a kitchen cabinet in the @entity12 home in @entity13 , @entity4			1
former record label boss @entity14 , 55 , found it when he pulled out the footboards between the cupboard and the floor to dry the units out after a leak			1
now he is trying to discover what on earth the skeleton may have been			0
he said : ' a plumber told me i had to dry out the footboards after a leak , and when i took one of them off , i found a collection of cleaning products but also this weird nest			2
' and inside it was this thing			0
' i have no idea what it is , but when i saw it i thought of the alien that bursts out of @entity54 's chest in the film			1
' mr @entity14 , who revolutionised dance music with his hit , @entity58 's @entity57 , took some photographs of the skeleton , which he said was around six inches long , and then threw it away because it was ' disgusting '			1
in @entity2 's 1979 classic , the @entity9 stalked and killed the crew of @entity9 after being brought on board the craft using hapless @entity67 , played by @entity54 , as a host			1
the terrifying film , which starred @entity70 as heroine @entity71 , became a cult classic and spawned a franchise with three sequels and an @entity76 spin - off			2
the creature was designed by @entity79 surrealist painter and sculpter @entity80 , who won an @entity81 for his design work on the film			2
today experts were divided on what the remains might have been			0
@entity14 , 55 , said the skeleton he discovered in his kitchen reminded him of @entity2 's horror film , @entity9 terrifying creature : in @entity2 's alien films , the aliens are terrifying beasts that take over @entity9 @entity94 , who runs the @entity96 's @entity95 , said : ' depending on size , it 's either a rat or mouse , and the alien appearance is due to the skull being reversed and pointing backwards			1
' the front legs and shoulder blades are also absent , which helps give it the alien appearance			0
the cocoon - like nest mentioned will have been the remaining skin , fur and webbing remaining from the feeding of moths			0
' he added : ' the tail still looks to be covered in skin so it is only likely to be a year or two old			0
' @entity119 , from the @entity117 at the @entity118 , told @entity120 : ' that looks very much like a very large rat , but the head has twisted around so that the skull is turned to look over the shoulder			0
' readers were split over what the skeleton was , with squirrels and rats being the options suggested by most , and one suggesting a marmoset .			0
