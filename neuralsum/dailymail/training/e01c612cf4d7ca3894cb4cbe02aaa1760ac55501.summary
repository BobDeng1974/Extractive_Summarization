by @entity0 published : 06:42 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 08:26 est , 25 february 2013 a brother and sister have been diagnosed with the same life - threatening condition that affects only three in a million people in the @entity5			1
four - year - old @entity6 was diagnosed first with @entity7 , a blood disorder that can lead to bone marrow failure and cancer			1
her mother @entity11 hoped her son @entity12 , three , would prove a suitable bone marrow donor to help save her life			1
but two months later she received the devastating news that he also had the same rare condition			2
@entity11 with her daughter @entity18 and son @entity12			1
both have been diagnosed with a rare blood disorder that can lead to bone marrow failure and cancer ms @entity11 had hoped that @entity12 would be a suitable bone marrow match for @entity18 , but two months later he too was diagnosed with the life - threatening condition luckily a donor match has been found should @entity12 need a transplant			1
but @entity11 and her partner @entity28 are still searching for a match for @entity18 , who will need a transplant in the next few years			2
ms @entity32 , a businesswoman from @entity33 , @entity34 , said : ' it was devastating when we found out @entity12 had @entity7 too			1
' the doctor was very honest with us and told us the average life expectancy was 30			0
' i 've explained to @entity18 that she has special blood and @entity12 just picks up anything his big sister says			1
' they are typical children - little angels on their own , but when they are together they become little devils			0
' @entity18 is four going on 14 and like any other young child loves her princesses and going to school			2
she is my little princess			0
' all i want is to see my children grow up			0
@entity18 and @entity50 : @entity18 was diagnosed first after their mother realised she bruised easily @entity18 and @entity12 as babies : their parents had no idea they had the rare condition at birth hopeful : ' all i want is to see my children grow up , ' says ms @entity11 ' we 've searched the international database and can not find a match for @entity18			1
we desperately need more people to come forward			0
' @entity18 , who was born with one kidney , was diagnosed with @entity7 in november 2012 when her mother noticed she was bruising easily			1
ms @entity11 said : ' if i was n't a pushy mother then we would never have found out she had @entity7			0
we might never have known until she got really poorly			0
' the condition is so rare i 've had to explain it to doctors and give them the standards of care documents			0
' @entity18 's blood white and blood cells and platelets count has stabilised but doctors have advised she will need a bone marrow transplant in the next few years			1
@entity12 , who was also born with one kidney , was diagnosed with the same condition last month			2
there are fewer than 150 sufferers of @entity7 in the @entity5 - with an incident rate of just three in one million - and research and detailed information about the condition is patchy			0
ms @entity11 and mr @entity28 , 53 , who are both @entity7 carriers , are now urging people to join the @entity90 bone marrow register			1
while a bone marrow donor has been found for @entity12 , the family are still searching for a match for @entity18 , who will need a transplant in the next few years @entity12 ( above ) , who was born with one kidney , was diagnosed two months after his sister the charity is dedicated to saving the lives of people with blood cancer who need a blood stem cell or bone marrow transplant			1
there are currently over 450,000 people on the register , but the charity can still only find a match for around half the people who come to them in need of a lifesaving transplant			0
ms @entity11 said : ' registering is really simple - people do not realise			0
all you have to do it spit in a pot and send it off and you are on the register			0
' my mother is @entity121 and the doctors think that there may be a match in the @entity121 community so she is going into community centres to try and get the word out			0
' @entity128 , from support charity @entity129 who has a daughter with the condition , said it is unusual for more than one child in a family to have @entity7			2
she said : ' genetic counselling is available for parents who have had a child with @entity7 , but the condition is normally not diagnosed until children are eight			2
' looking after one child with the condition is hard , so it is a very difficult position to be in to have two children with it			0
' to register on the bone marrow register go to www.anthonynolan.org/register			1

@entity6 , 4 , and her brother @entity12 , 3 , have @entity7
the rare blood disorder can lead to bone marrow failure and cancer
@entity18 was diagnosed first and it was hoped @entity12 ' bone marrow could help
but family 's hopes *dashed* two months later when he was also diagnosed
they are now desperately searching for bone marrow donor to save @entity18
