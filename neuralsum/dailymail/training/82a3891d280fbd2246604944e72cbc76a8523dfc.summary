@entity0 , the bird - flipping publisher of @entity2 magazine who helped break down legal barriers against pornography and raged against politicians , organized religion and anything that even suggested good taste , died today at a @entity10 hospice			1
according to a friend , attorney @entity12 , the controversial character passed away at the age of 77 after suffering from a long illness			1
of all the would - be successors to @entity19 's sexual throne , no one was as out there as @entity0			1
@entity0 , @entity2 publisher , attends the 25th anniversary party for @entity24 's @entity23 and @entity25 restaurants in 1998			1
he died today after a long illness whether taking potshots at sacred cows in the magazine 's pages , or placing an 11 - foot - tall sculpture of an extended middle finger outside his @entity34 home , his angry humor , garish attire , numerous divorces and x-rated mind made him an infamous national figure			1
' to be angry is to be alive			1
i 'm an angry jew			1
anger is better than love			2
i think it is more pure , ' he said in an interview in 2001			0
' there 's so much to be angry about , because people are ripped off , the election went to the wrong person , the good guys usually lose and society sucks			0
' to back that anger , @entity0 put his wallet where his mouth was , spending millions of dollars on @entity57 lawsuits , hundreds of thousands running unsuccessfully for sheriff in @entity34 , and millions more in numerous divorce settlements			1
@entity12 remembers @entity0 as an ' intellectual who cared about the world and geopolitics '			2
@entity0 , also known as the @entity63 , pictured in 1987 in his @entity24 office			2
he was sent to prison several times for obscenity but after a lavish lifestyle , @entity0 fell on difficult times , landing in a homeless shelter and a veterans hospital			1
' up until a month ago he still had that spark , ' said @entity12			0
' in fact , he gave me the middle finger			0
as he did it , he smiled at me			0
i knew he was still @entity0 inside this shell of a body			2
i kissed him and held his hand			0
many of his friends were like his sons			0
he had tremendous respect for friendships			0
' when he co-founded @entity2 in 1968 , the @entity86 legal system was embroiled in a battle over what constitutes obscenity			1
@entity0 never envisioned himself as a champion of free speech , but fought for what he said were his own prurient interests			2
' @entity2 grew from a combination of many factors , chief of which was my own dissatisfaction with the sex literature of 1968 and my yearning for a publication that reflected my sexual appetites , ' he wrote in the 1971 @entity2 anthology			2
but @entity0 also felt that the cultural and religious establishment had convinced his generation that sex was dirty and turned them into ' a lot of embarrassed people who bought nudie magazines on the sly '			2
publisher @entity0 and his longtime assistant @entity113 with a copy of @entity2 in 2003 the porn magazine 's scathing , scatological editorials railed against religious leaders and the government for justifying war while imprisoning erotic magazine publishers			1
@entity2 sold 140,000 copies a week at its height			2
' i may be making a lot of money , but i really believe i 'm doing some good by demythologizing a lot about sexuality , ' he told @entity129 in 1974			0
@entity0 entertains a crowd of onlookers outside the 1980 @entity132 held at the palladium in @entity134 but the law was never far away			2
during the magazine 's first three years , @entity0 was arrested 19 times on obscenity charges			1
spending millions to defend himself , he ultimately scored a major victory in 1974 when a federal judge threw out an obscenity case brought against him			0
after that the willingness of the government to prosecute such cases waned , ending a period that saw books such as @entity149 's @entity148 and @entity151 's @entity150 banned and kept erotic publications under the counter			0
but the victory left @entity0 feeling flat			2
' i really need the attention of being arrested , because that means i 'm still bugging the establishment , that i 'm still gadfly to the state , ' he told @entity129			0
' acceptance of me and @entity2 would be the kiss of death			0
' and it may have been the magazine 's undoing , as it was soon eclipsed by more explicit publications , like @entity165 's @entity163			0
@entity0 soon found other outlets , and in 1974 launched a sex - oriented cable porn show , " @entity168 , " which ran for nearly 30 years			1
as the poignancy of @entity2 faded , @entity0 became depressed and angrier			1
in 2002 , he was sentenced after a wild trial to 60 days in jail for harassing a former secretary with threatening phone calls and editorials			0
the conviction was later overturned when an appeals court ruled prosecutors had used overly inflammatory language at trial			0
a year later @entity0 pleaded guilty to harassing one of his four ex-wives with obscene phone messages			1
in late 2003 , the magazine folded and @entity0 filed for bankruptcy protection			1
on the upside , he lost 150 pounds following stomach stapling surgery the same year and married his fifth wife , a woman 40 years his junior			1
things fell so far , though , that in 2004 he told the @entity190 he was forced , at times , to sleep in a car and live in a @entity34 homeless shelter			0
' anyone who wishes ill on me should feel vindicated because my life has turned into a total horror , ' he told the @entity190			0
he is survived by his wife , @entity199 , and a son , @entity200			0
