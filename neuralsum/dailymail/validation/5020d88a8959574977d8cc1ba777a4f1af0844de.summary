the body of @entity1 , 32 , was found dumped in undergrowth four miles away from a nightclub where he had been , and his bank account cleared out through a cash machine			1
but a coroner in @entity2 recorded an open verdict - saying that he understood how the family concluded foul play , but could take the case no further after a four - year investigation			1
however , mr @entity1 ’s family believe his drink was spiked at the nightclub , before he was followed , robbed and murdered			1
his fully - clothed body was found face down in woodland			1
he had traces of heroin in his body - possibly from the spiked drink , toxicology tests showed			1
an inquest at @entity37 in @entity38 was told that the athletic electrician had flown to @entity40 a week earlier for a fortnight ’s break at his father and stepmother ’s holiday home			1

' what we expected ' : mr @entity1 pictured with his mother , @entity80 , who said she was ' disappointed ' after a coroner returned an open verdict at an inquest into his death he said the presence of @entity64 showed that heroin specifically had been present , rather than any other opiates , and he had found water on the lungs - which was consistent with heroin toxicity			1
toxicology tests showed he was below the drink - driving limit , with just 55mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood , 35mg off the 80mg @entity8 maximum			2
however the pathologist added that although the signs pointed towards opiate toxicity , given the state of decomposition , he felt unable to establish a cause of death			0
dr @entity69 added : ‘ an unusual fact is the location of @entity1 ’s body , which seems to be at odds with what he was doing , enjoying himself in a club			1
’ mr @entity1 grew up in @entity2 and trained to be an electrician , before relocating to @entity110 in @entity111 , where he took on a new job and dated a number of women			1

electrician : mr @entity1 had flown out for a fortnight ’s break at his father and stepmother ’s holiday home mr @entity1 ’s father told the inquest that he had received regular phone calls and texts from his son while he was away , which was unusual - but he had been having trouble with miss @entity118			1
she conceded they had had a volatile friendship , and that they had argued over ‘ silly ’ things because mr @entity1 was often in a bad mood - which led to a row in the holiday resort one night			1

tests on mr @entity1 ’s hair suggested ‘ occasional use of cocaine ’ in the months leading up to his death - but no other drug use other than ‘ exposure ’ to heroin , thought to be from when he lived with people who smoked the drug			1
his family have travelled to @entity4 on dozens of occasions to try to uncover the truth about what happened to mr @entity1 and to bring anyone responsible for his death to justice			2

mr @entity253 continued : ‘ she left and did not see or communicate with him again			0
the evidence of what happened next is somewhat sparse			0
the cause of death was unascertained			0
‘ i fully understand that @entity1 ’s parents believe that there has been foul play			1
it is not for me to speculate what may have happened to @entity1			2

i regret that i am unable to assist the family in any further ways			0
