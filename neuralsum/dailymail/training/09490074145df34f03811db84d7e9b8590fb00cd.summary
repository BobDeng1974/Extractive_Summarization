by @entity0 last updated at 10:03 pm on 27th february 2012 commons speaker @entity1 has defended plans to charge visitors to the @entity4 to see @entity5			1
from july , visitors will have to pay £ 15 to climb the 334 steps of the clock tower to see the famous bell - an experience which is currently free			0
mr @entity1 said the introduction of charges was to cover costs and would not be used to generate a profit			1
time running out : visitors will have to pay £ 15 to go up @entity5 from july in a cost - saving move by the @entity17 striking a chord : tours , which include the 334 - step climb to see the famous bell , are currently free the issue was raised in the @entity23 by @entity25 @entity24 who urged mr @entity1 to ' look again at the decision ' taken by the @entity17			1
the charges would cost a family of four up to £ 60 , he said and asked : ' are there not other ways of saving money ? ' mr @entity24 suggested that copies of @entity33 , the official record of parliamentary proceedings , could be published online rather than printed every day as one measure to cut costs			2
the @entity39 mp called on mr @entity1 to review the charge ' to ensure that we are a parliament for the many , not for the few '			2
discord : speaker @entity1 ( left ) said the move was merely to cover costs , but @entity25 mp @entity24 ( right ) said it would create a parliament ' for the few ' mr @entity1 said : ' it would be unthinkable to charge members of the public for access to the proceedings of the @entity17 or its committees , or indeed to meet their members of @entity57			1
' but , he continued : ' @entity59 tours are special tours , allowing access to an area of the @entity4 which realistically can not be open to all			0
' the charges agreed by the @entity17 are set at a level which will cover the costs - i emphasise , which will cover the costs - of providing these tours			1
no profit will be made			0
' mr @entity1 said it was open to mr @entity24 to take up the matter with the @entity73			0
mr @entity24 said the proposed changes were a ' disgraceful action ' by the @entity76			0
' the @entity78 taxpayer is already paying for the @entity17 and for @entity5 , ' he said .			0

speaker *insists* its only to cover costs
@entity25 mp *brands* the move ' disgraceful '
