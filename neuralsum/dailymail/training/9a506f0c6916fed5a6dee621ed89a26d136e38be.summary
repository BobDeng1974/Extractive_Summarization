a @entity3 prisoner 's choice of final meal can show how guilty or innocent they feel , a study has shown			1
researchers in the @entity7 found that those who believe they have been ' hard done by ' eat less food , or even avoid the meal altogether			1
those who have accepted guilt , meanwhile , ask for a third more calories in their meal on average			1
researchers have found that a @entity3 prisoner 's choice of last meal could indicate how guilty they feel the researchers proved their hypothesis – that those who felt innocent would eat less – correct after analysing the final meals of 247 prisoners between 2002 and 2006			1
they found that those who denied guilt were 2.7 times more likely to decline a meal than those who had admitted their crimes			1
they also showed that prisoners who had accepted guilt , either by apologising or confessing , asked for 34 per cent more calories of food – and were more likely to request a brand name or comfort foods			1
while there are many factors that could contribute to prisoners ' choices , it is thought that the final meals could tell researchers something about the degree of guilt , and could also be applied to anti-obesity research			1
@entity39 , of @entity40 , said : ‘ the growing macabre fascination with " last meals " offers a window into one 's true consumption desires when one 's value of the future is discounted close to zero			1
‘ but in contrast to popular anecdotes and individual case studies , we created an empirical catalog of actual last meals - the final food requests of 247 individuals executed in the @entity7 during a recent five - year period			1
' this photograph shows a death chamber in @entity59 , @entity60 he added : ‘ our content analyses reveal three key findings : [ firstly ] , the average last meal is calorically rich ( 2756 calories ) and proportionally averages 2.5 times the daily recommended servings of protein and fat			1
‘ [ secondly ] , the most frequent requests are also calorie dense : meat ( 83.9 per cent ) , fried food ( 67.9 per cent ) , desserts ( 66.3 per cent ) , and soft drinks ( 60 per cent ) , and [ thirdly ] 39.9 % requested branded foods or beverages			0
‘ given that some people who are warned about the ill effects of obesity might counter-intuitively engage in unhealthy overconsumption , the findings also suggest further study relating to the artificial use of mortality salience in campaigns against obesity			2
’ final meal requests in @entity87 range from salami sandwiches to @entity90 's whiskey a @entity3 prisoner 's choice of last meal fascinates like few other requests and has been the subject of a number of research projects in recent years			2
last year , artist @entity98 completed a 13 - year project painting more than 500 @entity3 final meals on to plates			1
they included everything from cigarettes to pizza and tubs of ice cream			0
the most commonly ordered meals were fast food from @entity110 and @entity111			2
meanwhile , in october , the @entity112 explored the final meal choices of the @entity3 inmates of @entity87			0
before @entity116 was put to death in 2006 , he requested some foods true to his southern locale			2
a deep fried feast of fried catfish , fried green tomatoes , fried eggplant and hush puppies were laid out for him before his lethal injection			0
@entity126 washed it down with sweet tea			0
@entity129 , an attempted bank robber and police officer killer , asked for tacos			0
so did @entity132 , who murdered the owner of a @entity135 strip club while he and accomplices robbed it			0
@entity138 , who raped and murdered an @entity140 woman and her two teen daughters after they asked him for directions in 1989 , asked for salami sandwiches and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich			0
@entity145 got a special treat at his 1979 execution			0
not only was he the first in @entity87 to be put to death following the @entity151 ’s reinstatement of the death penalty , but he also got to split a flask of @entity90 's whiskey with the prison superintendent			0
@entity157 ’ seven - man killing spree was immortalised in the 2003 film monster , but her life came to an end the year before			2
she declined a last meal and instead drank just a cup of coffee nine hours before she was put to death			0
taking the opposite route was @entity165 , who murdered a pregnant woman in 1982 along with her two young daughters			0
he chose to have a smorgasbord of lobster tail , fried potatoes , a half - pound of fried shrimp , six ounces of fried clam strips , half a loaf of garlic bread and 32 ounces of @entity176 root beer .			2

researchers in the @entity7 found that those who feel innocent or ' hard done by ' eat less
prisoners who have accepted guilt , by apologising or confessing , ask for a third more calories , according to the study
research was based on the last meals of 247 prisoners between 2002 - 2006
