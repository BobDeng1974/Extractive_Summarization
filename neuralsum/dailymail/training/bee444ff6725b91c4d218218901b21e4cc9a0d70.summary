by @entity0 published : 17:14 est , 28 january 2014 updated : 17:17 est , 28 january 2014 failing to get a good night 's sleep can make cancer more aggressive and speed its growth , researchers have claimed			1
they say that sleep disturbed by constant waking can make a noticeable difference in just four weeks			0
the researchers say the key is damage to the immune system , dampening its ability to control or eradicate early cancers			1
researchers say the discovery could lead to new treatments for cancer - but warn people to ' take care of your sleep quality and quantity like you take care of your bank account ' researchers experimented with genetically engineered mice that had been injected with tumor cells			1
as the mice slept during the day , a quiet , motorized brush moved through half of the cages every two minutes – forcing some of the mice to wake up and go back to sleep			1
the other mice were not disturbed as they slept			2
after just four weeks , the researchers found that the tumors in the mice with fragmented sleep patterns were twice as large as the tumors in the mice who had slept normally			1
in a study published in the journal @entity46 , researchers experimented with genetically engineered mice that had been injected with tumor cells			2
as the mice slept during the day , a quiet , motorized brush moved through half of the cages every two minutes – forcing some of the mice to wake up and go back to sleep			1
the other mice were not disturbed as they slept			0
after just four weeks , the researchers found that the tumors in the mice with fragmented sleep patterns were twice as large as the tumors in the mice who had slept normally			1
the study is the first to demonstrate , in an animal model , the direct effects of fragmented sleep on tumor growth and invasiveness , and it points to a biological mechanism that could serve as a potential target for therapy			2
' it ’s not the tumor , it ’s the immune system , ' said @entity68 , chairman of pediatrics at the @entity70 , who led the study			2
' fragmented sleep changes how the immune system deals with cancer in ways that make the disease more aggressive			1
' fortunately , our study also points to a potential drug target , ' he said			0
the lead researcher on the project said : ' the take home message is to take care of your sleep quality and quantity like you take care of your bank account			0
' ' toll - like receptor 4 , a biological messenger , helps control activation of the innate immune system			2
' it appears to be a lynchpin for the cancer - promoting effects of sleep loss			0
' the effects of fragmented sleep that we focused on were not seen in mice that lacked this protein			1
' ' this study offers biological plausibility to the epidemiological associations between perturbed sleep and cancer outcomes , ' @entity68 said			0
' the take home message is to take care of your sleep quality and quantity like you take care of your bank account			0
' the @entity112 estimate that about 70 million @entity113 suffer from chronic sleep problems			0
' considering the high prevalence of both sleep disorders and cancer in middle age or older populations , ' the authors wrote , ' there are far - reaching implications			0
' their next step is to determine whether sleep affects metastasis or resistance to cancer chemotherapy .			0

tumors in the mice with fragmented sleep patterns twice as large as the tumors in the mice who had slept normally
researchers say that poor sleep alters the immune system
@entity46 could lead to new targeted treatments for cancer
