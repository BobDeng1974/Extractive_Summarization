students at @entity1 will be banned from drinking or possessing hard alcohol on campus , regardless of their age , as part of new reforms by the school 's president			1
president @entity9 , who has led the @entity11 school since mid- 2013 , created a ' moving @entity1 forward ' steering committee last april to study problems he said were ' hijacking ' its promise : high - risk drinking , sexual assault and a lack of inclusion			1
the @entity22 school is currently one of 95 schools under federal investigation for its handling of sexual harassment and violence and has received national attention for allegations relating to fraternity hazing			1
it is part of a negative reputation the school has built in recent years , beginning with the release of @entity36 in 1978 , which was based on the drunken behavior of of @entity1 ’s @entity39 fraternity			1
the plan @entity9 outlined thursday includes banning hard alcohol - drinks with 30 proof or higher - for students on campus ; implementing a mandatory , four - year sexual violence prevention program ; ending pledge or probationary periods for all student groups ; and creating new residential communities			1
strict new guidelines : students at @entity1 ( pictured ) have been banned from drinking or possessing hard alcohol on campus because officials believe it is ' hijacking ' the school 's promise reputation : the 1978 film @entity36 starring ( from left to right ) @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , was based on the based on the drunken behavior of @entity1 ’s @entity39 fraternity during the announcement he said one of the main problems was ' pre-gaming ' - or loading up on alcohol before a night out			1
' our aspirations will never be realized if we fail to address a vital component : the environment in which our students live and learn , ' he said in a speech to students , faculty and staff			2
' we must recognize a moment in time when change is necessary in order to reach our potential , and now is such a moment			0
' students protested at @entity9 's office last spring with a long list of demands aimed at creating a more inclusive , diverse campus			2
' colleges and universities across the country face the issues i 've detailed today , ' @entity9 said			0
' we are not alone in facing them , but we will take the lead in saying , " no more "			0
' sexual assault on college campuses has been in the spotlight as students and the federal government demand stricter policies and stronger enforcement			2
seeking change : the policy at the @entity22 school is part of a new set of reforms which include measures against sexual violence prevention @entity1 recently overhauled its policies to include harsher sanctions and a trained external expert to investigate allegations			1
it will expand on that work with the new mandatory program , an online ' consent manual ' to reduce ambiguity about acceptable behavior and a smartphone app to allow students to easily seek help if they feel threatened , @entity9 said			0
in addition to prohibiting the possession or consumption of hard alcohol by students on campus , the new policy will include increased penalties for violators , and hard alcohol will no longer be served at public events , including alumni events and fraternity parties			1
though some have suggested eliminating fraternities and sororities , the steering committee 's comparison of other schools found that levels of extreme behavior do n't correlate with the intensity of the @entity147 scene			0
spotlight : president @entity9 , who has led the @entity11 school since mid- 2013 , told staff and students they will say ' no more ' to the issues colleges and universities are facing across the country but @entity147 organizations will be held to much higher standards going forward , @entity9 said			1
for example , they and all student organizations will undergo annual reviews to ensure they are upholding @entity1 's mission , including being inclusive and diversifying their membership			2
no student organization will be allowed to engage in pledging or putting new members on probationary status — a move fraternities and sororities already made this fall			0
' hazing is already outlawed on our campus , but it 's hard to imagine why you 'd have a pledge - type status unless it has something to do with some sort of hazing , so what 's being eliminated is the pledge term			2
once you join , you 're a full member , ' @entity9 said in an interview			0
of all the changes , @entity9 believes the most transformational will be the creation of new housing communities designed to give students more options for both social interaction and learning outside the classroom			0
starting with the class of 2019 , incoming students will be placed into one of six communities that will include a cluster of residence halls that will serve as a home base even for those who live elsewhere			0
each community will have a faculty adviser and graduate students in residence and will host social and academic programs .			0
