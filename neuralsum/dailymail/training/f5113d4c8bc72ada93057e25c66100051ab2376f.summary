@entity0 : babies are more likely to drift off to @entity3 , above , than @entity4 , parents claimed parents are ditching traditional lullabies to sing their children to sleep in favour of chart - topping pop songs , a study revealed yesterday			1
. a feeling that songs such as ' @entity13 ' are ' old - fashioned ' and ' silly ' emerged as the reasons with other mums and dads admitting they struggle to recall latter verses of the old favourites			2
instead , with many parents now listening to modern pop tunes on the radio or television , youngsters now favour @entity3 , @entity24 or @entity26 tunes over classics like @entity4			1
half of the 2,000 parents polled even admitted their children preferred singing along to chart toppers , with just 15 per cent still favouring nursery rhymes and lullabies			1
the survey for the makers of the award winning musical toy symphony in @entity37 also revealed @entity38 ' and @entity3 's ' @entity39 ' are the most popular songs for children			2
@entity44 ' ' @entity42 ' and ' diamonds ' and ' umbrella ' , by @entity26 completed the top five			1
other songs to feature in the poll include ' @entity48 ' by the @entity49 , @entity50 's ' @entity51 ' and @entity53 's ' @entity52 '			2
managing director @entity54 of @entity55 , distributors of @entity36 in @entity37 , said : ' it 's only natural that parents are singing more modern songs to their children nowadays			1
' we are surrounded by music every day , either on the radio , tv or in films , and often once you hear a song , you end up singing it without even realising			0
' many parents also seem to be more familiar with pop songs compared to the more traditional ones so it 's only natural they end up singing what they know to their children			1
' any way that parents engage with their children over music is a good thing , and it 's great that so many mums and dads sing to or with their children , whether that song is one or 100 years old			2
' evidence shows that children who listen to music are more likely to develop good language skills and all children find music and rhyme safe and comforting			0
' they experience a release in dopamine which helps them sleep more soundly , cope with pain better and generally be calmer			0
the study found that 88 per cent of children like to listen to music with half most likely to choose a modern pop song over a nursery rhyme or lullaby			1
eighty - five per cent of parents also reckon their children tend to prefer songs from their favourite tv shows			1
almost eight in ten parents also sing to their youngsters , with 64 per cent of those usually opting for a chart hit			1
while 45 per cent put it down to the fact that they have usually just heard the song so it 's in their head , more than a quarter said their children just prefer them to traditional nursery rhymes			1
another one in five admitted it 's because they know more of the words to modern songs than nursery rhymes , while more than one in twenty claimed they do n't know any traditional children 's songs			1
the modern music is n't always a good thing though as a third of parents admit their child is more likely to settle down with a traditional nursery rhyme			1
and more than half have let their children , intentionally or accidently , listen to a pop song which contained inappropriate lyrics			2
it also emerged that 89 per cent of parents think it is important that their children listen to music			2
and another 83 per cent of parents hope that encouraging their children to listen to music from a young age means they will have an interest in listening to or playing music as they get older			0
@entity54 , from @entity36 in @entity37 , added : ' we always knew that music was important to children and our toy allows children to appreciate music from a very early age			0
' thankfully these results show that over 70 per cent of children still like to sing along to classic nursery songs at least twice a week			2
