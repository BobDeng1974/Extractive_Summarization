by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 have offered @entity3 the chance to revive his stuttering career at the @entity6			1
the 23 - year - old , who was told he can leave @entity8 by manager @entity9 after failing to make an impression on the @entity11 , completed a £ 7million move to the north east			1
@entity3 arrived on @entity14 at midday on monday for a meeting with manager @entity16 and completed his move on tuesday on a five - year deal			1
@entity16 believes he can reinvigorate the career of @entity3 , who was tipped for greatness by @entity28 coaches when he was just 12			2
‘ he was light years ahead of anyone in his age group , ’ said one source close to @entity3 , whose life in football could have begun very differently had a certain club across @entity52 shared the glowing view of the midfielder who was invited to a trial at @entity56 as a six - year - old			1
however @entity61 talent - spotters could n’t quite see what all the fuss was about and they gave @entity3 , who can also play as a central defender , a small trophy to help soften the blow of his rejection			2
he was quickly enrolled at @entity28 and it did n’t take long before the club knew they had someone special on their hands			0
@entity27 did n’t need any convincing either , handing @entity3 his senior debut at the age of 16 in a @entity73 tie against @entity74 in 2007			0
just five years earlier @entity27 had handed another 16 - year - old his debut			1
but those close to @entity77 claim the @entity78 was far more excited about the emergence of @entity3 than he was @entity80			0
@entity82 manager sir @entity81 agonised over a move for @entity3 , but concluded that the youngster lacked the physical presence to compete for a first - team place			1
stop - start : @entity3 has endured an up - and - down few years on the domestic and international stage likewise , upon joining @entity90 in 2010 , @entity89 told scouts to monitor @entity3 ’s performances at @entity28			1
but little did @entity89 know that @entity94 scouts were already doing just that			0
it seemed nothing was going to stop the kid from @entity99			0
but no - one could foresee the injury woes that were just round the corner , with persistent hamstring problems restricting @entity3 to just 19 appearances — two of which came for @entity106 — during the 2011 - 12 season			1
yet that did n’t stop @entity109 splashing £ 12m on the youngster in august 2012			0
the @entity111 had high hopes for @entity3 at @entity8 , but the @entity113 made just 10 starts for the club in two seasons , due , in part , to his problematic hamstrings			2
those who have studied @entity3 ’s injury concerns feel they are partly due to deficiencies in his body alignment rather than a weakness of his leg muscles			0
at 23 , @entity3 still has time on his side			2
but he knows he can ill - afford another hamstrung season .			0

the 23 - year - old has completed a £ 7million move to @entity2
@entity3 played 10 times for the @entity30 champions last season
had been scouted by @entity90 and @entity82 early in his career
