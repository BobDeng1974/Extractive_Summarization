by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ when @entity2 met @entity4 chairman @entity3 last week , he gave him three specific transfer targets			1
@entity7 defender @entity6 , @entity9 midfielder @entity8 and @entity11 striker @entity10 were the men he wanted at @entity13 next season			0
@entity2 ’s recommendations had been taken so seriously during a transfer meeting the previous month that director of football @entity17 went to watch @entity19 play @entity20 on march 30 , instead of travelling to @entity21 to watch @entity4			1
given the 4 - 0 scoreline at @entity24 , it was a wise decision			0
video : scroll down to watch @entity2 defiant over @entity4 future after 5 - 1 win all over bar the shouting : @entity2 will be replaced as @entity4 manager in the summer character : @entity2 has been outspoken as @entity4 boss and at times it might have been too much attention ! @entity2 ( right ) salutes @entity34 after the @entity4 striker 's second against @entity37 do n't get too comfortable : @entity2 ( centre ) sits in the dug - out before @entity4 's 5 - 1 win over @entity37 this break from the norm for @entity17 , who usually sits close to @entity3 in the directors ' box at @entity4 matches , was significant			1
@entity10 and @entity8 both played the full 90 minutes for @entity20 in their 3 - 1 victory and they were wanted men			0
@entity2 was desperate to get them to @entity4			1
at the time he was in with a chance of keeping the job , despite the interest from @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
of the names under consideration at @entity13 , former @entity4 striker @entity58 is the only candidate who has not been agitating for the job behind the scenes			1
@entity63 tick there from the boardroom			0
more on them in a moment			0
@entity2 knows he has made mistakes since he replaced @entity69 as @entity4 ’s manager and it probably was n’t a good idea to ask for the ear of the chairman after another leathering , this time at @entity21			1
@entity75 knows @entity3 has had a gutful of that this season and anybody who knows him will tell you that no - one gets away with humiliating @entity4 ’s chairman in public			1
this season alone he has been on the end of some hidings : 6 - 0 and 5 - 1 against @entity9 , 5 - 0 and and 4 - 0 against @entity24 , 4 - 0 at @entity11 , 3 - 0 at home to @entity7 and three defeats against @entity88			0
in @entity3 ’s world , someone will always pay the price for that			0
@entity2 has certainly provided some entertainment in his 23 games in charge of @entity4 , but @entity3 believes he lacks maturity and stature for such a prestigious position			2
@entity2 's targets : @entity10 , @entity8 ( below left ) and @entity6 ( below right ) were wanted by @entity2 when he thought he still had a future as @entity4 manager it probably was n’t wise , even in jest , for @entity2 to say that he would be returning to the technical area for the @entity37 game and ‘ might knock a few people out ’			1
he is highly - emotional , passionate about his work and his team			0
there is something to be said for that , even if it is a bit much at times			0
@entity2 spoke of the ‘ shackles coming off ’ after the team ran out 5 - 1 winners against @entity37 on monday , shining a torch on his pre-match team talk with @entity4 ’s players			2
they have been made aware that their manager is leaving at the end of the season and will be replaced someone with vast experience in the game			0
waiting game : @entity54 ( right ) has kept @entity4 hanging on as he watches the situation at @entity132 big tick : @entity58 ( left ) is favoured by the @entity4 board , while @entity55 also wants the job under pressure : @entity56 ( left ) remains an option for @entity4 if he is fired by @entity138 not the answer : @entity140 boss @entity57 is n't ready to manage @entity4 that is @entity3 ’s wish , something he has already articulated to his board as he begins to plan for next season			1
presumably this means @entity140 manager @entity57 , who has lost twice against @entity4 in the league this season , is not ready for the 14th biggest job in @entity151 football , according to the 2014 @entity152			1
at 42 , a man who refuses to speak @entity154 despite a near perfect command of the language , is not the answer for @entity4 at this moment in time			2
@entity58 , who is preparing for the @entity159 with the @entity160 , had been offered the position until the end of the season when @entity69 was fired			1
@entity3 had tried to tempt him with the bait that he could keep a closer eye on the @entity160 playing in @entity166 if he could help @entity4 out in the short term			2
@entity58 said no. rebuilding job : @entity3 ( front ) will have to appoint yet another manager after @entity138 ’s stunning 4 - 3 defeat at home by @entity173 on march 23 , @entity56 was under so much pressure at the @entity175 he believed he could be fired at the end of the season			1
his team are now third in @entity178 , three points off @entity180 , although they are in friday ’s draw for the @entity183 semi-final after beating @entity184			0
@entity56 has not been ruled out			2
the @entity185 remains an option if he is fired			2
then there is @entity188 , the man who has kept @entity4 waiting after hanging out for the possibility that @entity132 could replace @entity190			1
the relative upturn in recent results , with the exception of the 3 - 0 defeat at home by @entity9 , has closed the door on @entity188 ’s hopes of heading to @entity198			0
@entity190 is staying for the time being			0
@entity2 will not remain and he will walk away from @entity4 after their final game of the season at home to @entity203 on may 11			2
beyond that , @entity3 will have to start rebuilding this club			0

@entity58 is favoured by the @entity4 board to be the next manager because he has n't agitated for the job
the @entity211 was offered post after @entity69 was sacked
@entity54 has been waiting for the @entity132 job
@entity56 is an option if he is fired by @entity138
@entity55 is also keen to be @entity4 manager
@entity140 boss @entity57 could be *deemed* not ready
