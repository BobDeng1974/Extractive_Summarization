these pictures show the incredible lengths rangers will go to when moving rhinos to a ' safe haven ' within @entity5 's flagship reserve where they will receive extra protection from poachers			1
rangers at @entity9 have carried out at least 45 such captures since last month as part of a plan to create a stronghold and prevent the slaughter of the endangered animals			1
the rhinos were first darted from a low - flying helicopter and then herded towards a road			1
once they were subdued and blindfolded , rangers took blood and skin samples and installed a microchip in the horns as a way to identify @entity26 's stock			1
some of the rhinos have been moved to other parks within @entity5 , which is home to 80 per cent of the world 's rhinos , and the relocation ' experiment ' is expected to escalate next year			2
it was announced earlier this week that 1,020 rhinos have been poached so far in 2014 , exceeding last year 's record of 1,004			2
about two - thirds of the rhinos poached this year died in @entity26 , a park that 's about the size of @entity55 and larger than the @entity57 state of @entity58			1
@entity9 has conducted about 45 such captures as part of a plan to create a stronghold within the country 's flagship reserve a darted rhino has skin and blood samples taken and gets microchipped by a ranger at the park poachers often dodge an overstretched force of 400 rangers as well as some military units that monitor the 220 - mile border between @entity26 and @entity74			1
the protection zone encompasses at least one - quarter of the park , and is already home to many of @entity26 's roughly 10,000 rhinos - half the national population			1
dr @entity81 , a large mammal ecologist at @entity26 , said the relocated rhinos have adapted well to their new home			0
' it 's like they 're coming to a saturday afternoon party , ' he said			0
the sedative must be strong enough to immobilise a rhino but weak enough so that the animal can walk into a crate with men pushing and pulling it with a rope investigators open the decomposed corpse of a poached rhino in search of forensic evidence @entity99 , head of veterinary services at @entity9 , said : ' the goal is to basically ensure that you 've got a foundation of animals that are secure and that you can use as a source population to take elsewhere			2
' @entity26 will focus aircrafts , ranger teams and high - tech surveillance on the zone			1
the initiative is partly funded by @entity57 philanthropist @entity111 , a son of investor @entity112 who pledged nearly Â£ 15million to @entity26 's anti-poaching efforts			0
low - flying helicopters locate the rhinos , fire darts at them and herd them into a nearby road tracking rangers with their dogs reveal how they locate the rhinos and transfer them to the protection zone @entity111 said some of the same methods used by the @entity57 to monitor its border with @entity127 will be used in @entity26 , including aerostats - large , tethered balloons with infrared cameras that scan the landscape			1
environmental affairs minister , @entity132 , said ' @entity5 is considering a range of rhino strongholds , inclusive of national parks , provincial reserves , communal areas and private reserves			0
' she added that the @entity140 was also looking into the benefits of moving some rhino out of the country			0
rhinos were once common throughout @entity5 and @entity145 with an approximated worldwide population of 500,000 in the early twentieth century			0
but despite intensive conservation efforts , poaching of this species is dramatically increasing , pushing the remaining rhinos closer and closer towards extinction			0
the @entity153 black rhino was declared extinct by the @entity154 ( @entity154 ) in 2011 , with the primary cause identified as poaching			0
all five remaining rhinos species are listed on the @entity158 of threatened species , with three out of five species classified as critically endangered			0
@entity5 is home to 83 per cent of @entity5 's rhinos and 73 per cent of all wild rhinos worldwide			0
it was announced earlier this week that 1,020 rhinos have been poached so far in 2014 , exceeding last year 's record of 1,004			0
about two - thirds of the rhinos poached this year died in @entity26 , a park that 's about the size of @entity55 and larger than the @entity57 state of @entity58			2
this is far higher than the total of 668 rhinos killed by poachers in @entity5 in 2012			2
it was announced earlier this week that 1,020 rhinos have been poached so far in 2014 , exceeding last year 's record of 1,004 @entity26 will focus aircrafts , ranger teams and high - tech surveillance on the protection zone			1

rangers are moving rhinos to a ' safe haven ' with protection from poachers
@entity186 at @entity9 are first darted from a low - flying helicopter
they are then blindfolded and installed with a *micro-chip* for tracking
aircrafts , rangers and high - tech surveillance will be focused on safe zone
