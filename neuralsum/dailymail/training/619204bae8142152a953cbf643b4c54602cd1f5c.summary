by @entity0 for the @entity1 a former teacher , @entity2 will have no need of a ghost writer to pen his memoirs			1
the @entity7 chapters will make for essential reading			1
the @entity9 can already visualise how they will end ; silver laden and filled with tales of triumph			1
the middle section will develop the plot			1
the introduction ? @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 will make that read like a crime noir novel			2
by his own admission , @entity2 has struggled to plough through the opening pages of life at @entity7			1
yet the @entity9 subscribes to the view that for the new and unfamiliar to become normal , a man must be overwhelmed for a bit on the way			1
@entity2 has had a difficult start to life at @entity7 , with the @entity32 lagging in an alien 5th place one of @entity2 's first signings was @entity36 's @entity35 on a season - long loan deal ‘ i think now it is chapter two , ’ said @entity2 ahead of today ’s @entity39 clash with @entity40 at @entity41			1
‘ but i am very glad that i had chapter one here , because it ca n’t be more intense than those 10 weeks were , travelling all over @entity46 , a lot of new things			2
‘ without those 10 weeks , i would n’t be here with the knowledge i have now			2
so that has been positive			2
it becomes my chapter now			2
’ already there are @entity7 supporters who find @entity2 ’s team sheets unreadable and incomprehensible			1
the suspicion he does n’t yet know his best team has been both difficult to shift and damaging			1
yet he probably still does n’t — and wo n’t for some weeks			2
@entity58 and @entity59 have yet to play a first - team game while the inclusion of @entity35 , @entity62 and @entity63 offers no guarantees of immediate and sweeping improvement			2
@entity2 ( right ) was unveiled as @entity7 manager with @entity67 ( left ) on june 6 @entity68 became @entity7 manager after six years in charge of @entity71 the problem for @entity2 is that he talks a good game even when his team ca n’t match his fine words			1
in the early weeks , the 38 - year - old ’s idealism about systems and philosophies obscured a basic truth ; @entity7 ’s squad was n’t good enough			1
a fact which compounded an already huge cultural shift for the new manager			1
‘ it ’s a situation that i do n’t think anybody can put themselves into , ’ he said of managing @entity7			1
‘ to take a big team is one thing			2
i had never been to @entity91 before – well , one time - but coming into a new culture and a new team and new experiences , and then you have also the @entity96 coming very quickly			2
‘ and also the ( transfer ) window takes a lot of energy			2
so there were so many tasks and you have to know your staff , you have to put your ideas in — there ’s an unbelievable lot to do			2
’ there have been times , bluntly , when people have wondered if the former coach of @entity71 might not be up to it			1
@entity7 chief executive @entity67 insisted he is — describing the situation @entity2 inherited , with @entity96 qualifiers and a weaker squad , as a ‘ s * * * storm ’			1
‘ i can understand what @entity67 is saying , ’ added the @entity9			1
‘ but it has been fantastic , as well			2
‘ the opportunity is fantastic and i think there is so much potential here			2
when i look at the players , i see a lot of skills and a lot of opportunities			2
’ @entity2 admits his first three months in charge of the @entity91 giants has bee hectic @entity2 is a relatively inexperienced manager , and some @entity7 fans have not taken to him the international break offered the first real pause for reflection , an opportunity to return home , visit his daughters and think some clear thoughts			1
‘ there was a lot of reflection , ’ he conceded			0
‘ when it ’s games all the time , it ’s very hard to see the whole picture , so to get home it was very good to just reflect on things and see where we are and what the next moves are			0
‘ i can see positive things happening and , of course , things that we need to do better			0
that is how the process is going on			0
i ’m looking forward now to getting started			0
’ @entity2 maintains that the fitness and speed of movement has to improve and that it will			1
@entity58 is not yet 100 per cent while @entity59 only returned from international duty last night , rendering both of the new signings frustratingly out of reach for now			0
but the @entity9 still claims he can see what he wants and how he wants to get there			1
enacting change while getting results is a tricky business ; a difficult balancing act			1
but he knows now what he is dealing with after a bewildering , overwhelming start to life at @entity7			1
@entity2 was unveiled during a photo call at @entity41 on friday june 6 @entity7 's ambitions of a third successive @entity96 campaign ended on august 6 at @entity173 ‘ of course there has been a lot of pressure , ’ @entity2 continued			1
‘ i think the pressure after results is different to what i ’m used to			0
‘ but also we have much better players here			0
the @entity96 is a very high level so the fitness we had , and the squad we had , was not good enough			0
‘ i wanted to be in the @entity96 , that ’s for sure			0
the best thing is that the window is closed and i have finished with those questions			0
‘ we know what we have to work with and how we are going to develop the best possible team with the players we have			0
‘ you have to get results and also get your own style and develop things			0
you do n’t want to do that too early because it can affect the immediate results			0
now we know what kind of squad we have until @entity201 and that is positive			0
’ @entity40 will travel to @entity203 fancying their chances			0
a dismal run of 18 straight @entity206 defeats in the league stretches back to 2004 , but fails to reflect a bold , gutsy , @entity209 win in @entity203 ’s east end last season			0
often more effective in attack away from home , @entity40 will ask questions of @entity2 ’s reshaped team			1
few expect them to show much sign of fear and neither should they			0
‘ you would have to ask them that , ’ added @entity2			1
‘ but i know how good we are when we are playing well			0
we ’ve had good spells in every match			0
@entity2 reacts during the third qualifying round of the @entity96 in @entity225 , @entity226 ‘ we did n’t play well against @entity227 but we had 70 - per - cent possession and made 700 passes			1
we just have to create more			0
‘ it would be worse if we did n’t have the ball , so it ’s about what we do with our attacking play			0
it ’s also about our defending , especially in transition			0
‘ that ’s what i love to do , to work with a team which has the ball a lot			0
i want us to look more like we did against @entity242			0
we showed ourselves in a good way that day			0
‘ in time , we will hopefully see that every week			0
