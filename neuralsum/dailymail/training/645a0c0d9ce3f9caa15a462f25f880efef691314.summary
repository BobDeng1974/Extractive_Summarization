the @entity2 scheme is not helping the poorest workers it was set up to support , a damning investigation has found			1
fairtrade goods , which include bananas , coffee and chocolate , generate annual @entity9 sales of £ 1.78billion			1
farmers signing up to the scheme must agree to meet social , labour and environmental standards set by @entity13			1
but research by the @entity15 ’s @entity16 has found that on @entity2 farms in @entity19 and @entity20 , profits failed to trickle down to much of the workforce			1
damning : a report said the @entity2 scheme was not always helping the workers that needed it most the government - sponsored report claimed the scheme , established more than 20 years ago , has not effectively improved the lives of the poorest people			1
it even concluded that wages on non-certified farms were actually higher than for those growing @entity2 products			2
researchers also found evidence of ‘ widespread use ’ of child labour – with some workers as young as ten – when doing checks on 1,500 @entity2 workers			1
one of the report ’s authors , @entity15 economics professor @entity44 , said : ‘ wages in other comparable areas and among comparable employers producing the same crops but where there was no @entity2 certification were usually higher and working conditions better			2
‘ in our research sites , @entity2 has not been an effective mechanism for improving the lives of wage workers , the poorest rural people			2
’ the study found that some social projects funded through @entity2 were found not to provide equal benefit to all			0
in one example , modern toilets funded through the scheme were reserved for managers , while poor workers did not have access to proper facilities			0
child labour : the report examined farming under @entity2 in @entity20 ( pictured ) and @entity19 meanwhile , when workers aged over 14 years were interviewed , ‘ a very large proportion of them said they had been working since the age of 10 , or even earlier ’ , the report said			1
‘ what is clear ... is that very significant numbers of young , school - age children are having to work for wages in the production of agricultural export crops , including @entity2 - certified commodities			2
’ the authors attacked a ‘ combination of idealism and naivety ’ to explain why @entity2 did not reach the poorest people			0
‘ one possibility is that @entity2 producer organisations are always established in significantly poorer , more marginalised areas where an accumulation of disadvantages means smallholder farmers are unable to pay even the paltry wages offered by smallholders in other areas without @entity2 producer organisations , ’ the report said			2
‘ @entity2 attempts to support and subsidise co-operative groups of ‘ smallholder ’ producers on the remarkably naïve assumption that the benefits of this support are distributed evenly amongst the group			0
this assumption about egalitarian distribution is unwarranted			0
’ @entity13 said in a statement that the report was ‘ unfair and generalised ’			1
a spokesman said : ‘ in several places it compares wages and working conditions of workers in areas where small - scale @entity2 - certified tea and coffee farmers were present with those on large - scale plantations in the same regions , ” it said in a statement			2
study : farmers in @entity127 , central @entity20			0
@entity13 said the study was too generalised ‘ the report itself identifies farm size , scale and integration into global trade chains as major factors influencing conditions for wage workers , but then its conclusions appear to be based on unfair and distorted comparisons between farms and organisations of dramatically different size , nature and means			1
‘ when comparisons are based more on like - for - like situations , such as the study ’s own analysis of @entity19 coffee in small scale coffee production set - ups , it finds key areas where workers in areas with @entity2 - certified farmer organisations in fact had better conditions compared with those in non-certified , such as free meals , overtime payments and loans and wage advances for workers			1
‘ this is in sharp contrast to the more generalised conclusions being presented by the @entity16 team			0
’ @entity2 was founded by overseas development and consumer groups including @entity169 and the @entity170 - and has grown into one of the world ’s most trusted ethical schemes			0
it is involved with 1.24 million farmers and workers around the world , and the @entity177 contributes to the funding of schools , health clinics and sanitation projects			0
farmers joining the scheme must agree to meet social , labour and environmental standards			0
fairtrade products are not only popular with individual consumers but also served by @entity188 , the @entity189 and airline @entity190 .			0

@entity192 began 20 years ago and generates £ 1.78bn a year in @entity9 sales
but government - sponsored research found *faults* in @entity19 and @entity20
they found widespread use of child labour with some workers aged just 10
wages on some @entity206 farms were actually higher than on others
@entity13 *insisted* the report was ' unfair and generalised '
