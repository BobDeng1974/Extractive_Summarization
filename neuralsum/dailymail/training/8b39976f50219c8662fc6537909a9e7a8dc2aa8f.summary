an earthquake has struck the @entity2 area of the @entity3 again , just 24 hours after a similar tremor shook houses in the area for ten seconds			1
initial data released by the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) said the latest 3.5 - magnitude quake , the biggest in the region since october 2001 , struck the @entity12 area at around 7:50 am today			1
yesterday ’s 3.2 - magnitude quake occurred at 7:07am and reportedly shook houses			2
today 's earthquake struck at 7:50am , just 24 hours after the previous one hit at 7:07am on 17 april , causing some alarm for members of the public the @entity19 is not itself generally associated with earthquakes			1
however , according to the @entity8 , 20 to 30 tremors are felt every year , while a few smaller ones are tracked by sensitive instruments			1
while most are small and cause no damage , there is the potential for larger ones in future			1
the @entity19 does not lie on a major fault line , but it ’s thought that smaller unseen fault lines , known as blind fault lines , are deeper underground			1
nearby tectonic boundaries such as that between @entity34 and @entity35 can induce tremors in smaller fault lines like the ones in the @entity19			1
27 february 2008magnitude 5.2 – @entity39 april 19905.1 - @entity40 june 19316.1 – @entity41 november 18525.3 – @entity42 april 15805.8 – @entity44 straits ‘ if you look at your hand , imagine the main lines as a major tectonic boundary , ’ @entity45 , a seismologist at the @entity8 , explains to @entity46			2
‘ between these are little lines , and if you gently squeeze your hand you see that even these smaller lines move back and forwards			2
’ while today ’s earthquake was large for the @entity19 , tremors are a common and largely unnoticed occurrence across the rest of the world			1
it is estimated that 17,000 to 20,000 earthquakes of this size occur every year in the world			1
however , seismologists think that a larger one could strike the mainland @entity19 one day and cause significant damage			1
‘ this particular one was 3.5 which in @entity19 terms is quite significant , ’ says @entity45			1
‘ we maybe get one or two a year of that size			0
‘ we had a 4.1 in the @entity76 back on the 20th of february			0
they ’re not like buses - they come when they want , but statistically we do n’t get many of this size			0
’ it 's thought that millions of years ago the @entity19 could have been situated over a major fault line such as the @entity84 , pictured at @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity87 for residents of @entity2 , the tremors proved to be cause for some alarm			1
within half an hour of the first quake striking , the @entity8 had received around 140 calls from people who had felt the tremors			1
according to the @entity8 , an earthquake has to reach a magnitude of 4.5 before it can be expected to do any damage			1
emergency services have not reported any casualties or damage to property			0
among those who felt yesterday 's tremor was former @entity106 rugby union player @entity105			2
he tweeted : ' we 've just had an earthquake in @entity12			2
the house was shaking for about 10 secs			0
' @entity111 , 40 , was getting four year - old son @entity112 for school when it struck			2
ms @entity114 , of @entity115 , @entity116 , said : ' the shaking sound started quite suddenly and my electric toothbrush fell from the shelf into my sink			0
' it felt like a lorry going past my house but about ten times louder			2
there was a second shake soon after the first one stopped			0
' i was n't too scared because i remember when we had a tremor here about eight years ago			0
' my son was a bit frightened because he 'd never felt anything like it before			2
but he 's a boy , so he did think it was pretty cool			0
' a @entity8 chart shows the tremors from the first earthquake that hit @entity2 shortly after 7am yesterday before the second earthquake , a magnitude 3.5 , struck today the spike in the seismology readings can clearly be seen when the first earthquake hit yesterday the reason for two earthquakes occurring so close to each other might be the result of stresses building up in the faults			1
magnitude 1 and 2 – not felt by people , detected by instruments			1
magnitude 3 – silght tremor felt by people indoors , likened to a passing lorry			2
magnitude 4 – can crack walls , disturb trees			2
magnitude 5 – moves furniture , damages poorly built buildings			2
magnitude 6 – moderate to major damage , chimneys and walls collapse			0
magnitude 7 – major damage to all buildings , ground cracks , landslides can occur			0
magnitude 8 – total destruction , waves can be seen travelling through the ground			0
‘ in other parts of the world they would n’t be talking about this , ' says @entity45			0
‘ the tremor is very , very small compared to the quakes we see in areas of high seismic activity such as @entity181			0
‘ for us 90 per cent of earthquakes are unnoticed , but when [ the bigger ones ] do happen we get alarmed			0
‘ the public is not calibrated to them , maybe because people think they do n’t actually happen			0
’ @entity45 says this one was probably more noticeable as well because many people are off work for the @entity191 holiday			0
‘ this one happened at a good time today for people to feel it			0
‘ they are lying down in an ideal position to feel earthquakes , very small tremors that people would never expect to feel			1
‘ if you look at what people describe it ’s like a large lorry going past			0
‘ an earthquake of this size can go unnoticed up in the highlands , or if it happens at a time of day where people are busy or in road traffic			0
‘ many people today also realise another happened yesterday , so they are more aware			0
‘ people are looking out for them now , and in shops and supermarkets they ’ll be saying “ oh , did you feel the earthquake ? ” to each other			0
' sensitive equipment is able to measure tiny tremors unnoticed by the public in the @entity19 scientists from @entity225 claim fracking could cause powerful earthquakes capable of destroying buildings as the process of extracting gas weakens fault lines deep underground			1
@entity87 geologists said that a domino effect of quakes could be caused by intense pressure on fault lines created by hydraulic fracturing , combined with seismic activity thousands of miles away			1
the @entity225 scientists maintain that powerful earthquakes can trigger swarms of minor quakes near waste water injection wells like those used for in oil and gas recovery			0
they say a recent surge in @entity87 oil and gas production using vast amounts of water to crack open rocks and release natural shale gas has been linked to an increase in small to moderate induced earthquakes in five states			2
seismologists from the university have identified three quakes in @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260 that they believe were triggered at injection well sites by a major earthquake a long distance away			2
the discovery , published in the journal @entity266 by one of the world 's leading seismology labs , threatens to make fracking even more controversial			0
a joint @entity19 study of hydraulic fracturing by @entity273 and the @entity274 said that fracking can be managed effectively in the @entity19 as long as operational best practices are implemented and robustly enforced through regulation			2
the experts also said that earth tremors induced by hydraulic fracturing are likely to be of a smaller magnitude than the @entity19 naturally experiences or than is related to coal mining activities			1
the biggest earthquake on record to hit the @entity19 was a 6.1 back in 1931			1
fortunately this one hit offshore and did n’t cause much damage on the mainland , but @entity45 says there is the possibility that one of this size could still hit the mainland @entity19			1
‘ we ’re quite a distance from immediate fault lines , like the @entity295 running up to @entity296			1
‘ but we do have a major plate tectonic boundary between the @entity34 plate and the @entity35 plate			0
‘ the @entity35 plate is rubbing up on the @entity34 plate , so that causes stresses that build up on existing fault lines the @entity19 has			1
‘ some could be a few metres long , some are long , but over time stresses build up			0
‘ perhaps historically many millions of years ago they could have been more active			0
‘ i ’m sure there were larger earthquakes at some time			1
' earthquakes occur when tectonic plates rub together			0
for places like the @entity19 , we experience tremors from smaller fault lines that are susceptible to these larger plate movements when these might occur though , or why these two were localised in @entity2 , remains a mystery			1
‘ there is a possibility one of that size can hit the mainland @entity19 , ' @entity319 continues			1
‘ the unusual feature of earthquakes is we do n’t know where they might occur			0
’ ‘ we do n’t know why it was localised in @entity2			2
‘ there could be faults underground that we do n’t know of			0
‘ in other parts of the world with earthquakes they do n’t know of all the fault lines			1
‘ there could be lots of blind fault lines , we ’ve got a long way to go to understand these processes through seismology			1

a magnitude 3.5 earthquake has struck @entity2 again in the @entity3
the tremors were felt at 7:50am today , just 24 hours after the last one
region has now been hit by two earthquakes in quick *succession*
these types of earthquake are themselves small and common in the world
but seismologists warn there could be hidden fault lines under the @entity19
these could lead to larger earthquakes occurring on the mainland in future
