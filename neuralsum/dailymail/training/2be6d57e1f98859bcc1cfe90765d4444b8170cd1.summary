one boy at the school was also heard shouting ‘ bedroom tax b * * * * * ds ’ at mr @entity7 as he left the event on wednesday evening			1
the taunt is a reference to the government ’s @entity51 , which requires council house tenants to pay a premium for having a spare bedroom if they do not wish to move to smaller accommodation			1
it is unclear how many pupils were involved			0

’ another @entity93 mp , who was present at the event , said : ‘ it is pretty ironic that privileged kids at a £ 30,000 - a - year school are shouting about the bedroom tax			1

’ a @entity114 source said that at least one shout was heard from the school during the prime minister ’s speech , but insisted it was ‘ not a matter of much consequence ’			1
