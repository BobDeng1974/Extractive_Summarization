by @entity0 @entity1 defied those who criticised her for dancing while pregnant saying : it 's ' good exercise '			1
she added : ' what do people expect us to do , just sit at home resting all day ? ' when @entity1 , star of @entity9 , took to the stage at the @entity11 at 22 weeks pregnant in december , she thought nothing of her protruding bump			1
her mind was only on delivering the stunning routines with partner @entity16 that have thrilled viewers for the past ten years			0
but the audience was not equally unfazed by her dancing ‘ in her condition ’			1
one angry fan even rang the venue afterwards to complain – saying they may not have bought a ticket had they known			2
for in spite of increasing evidence of the benefits of exercising while pregnant – and that ‘ putting your feet up ’ is an unhealthy thing to do – it remains a controversial subject			2
‘ the complaint did n’t bother me – i laughed more than anything else , ’ says @entity1 , 39			1
now 36 weeks pregnant and due at the end of the month , she is still going to the gym			1
‘ there ’s nothing wrong with dancing while pregnant ; it ’s good exercise			1
what do people expect us to do , just sit at home resting all day ? ‘ i ’ve not performed since but still work out and teach dancing – i dance belly to belly with the students to show how it ’s done			1
' i do get looked at a lot in the gym when i walk in and when i ’m working out – especially now i ’m really big with only four weeks to go			1
' but i think if a lady can work out when pregnant , then good on her			2
exercising brings many benefits – like an easier recovery after birth – and i ’ll do whatever i can to make things easier			2
’ as well as speeding recovery after labour , exercising while pregnant is good for the baby ; recent research has suggested it can boost brain development , strengthen blood vessels and protect from diabetes			1
meanwhile , many pregnant women – and their babies – suffer health problems due to excess weight : obesity in pregnancy can trigger pre-eclampsia , diabetes , and even cause foetal abnormalities			2
around half of all mothers - to - be are now overweight or dangerously obese			2
@entity1 , who lives in @entity76 , @entity77 , with her husband @entity78 , 48 , dropped out of @entity9 last may as she wanted to conceive			1
@entity1 with her dancing partner @entity9 's @entity16			1
@entity1 is now 36 weeks pregnant and due at the end of the month but she is still going to the gym ‘ @entity82 was ticking on and i wanted to have a baby – i was already 38 and did n’t want to push it too far			1
i knew @entity9 would be too much if i was pregnant as it is very , very strenuous , and seven days a week , seven hours a day			2
’ the @entity87 - born dancer conceived naturally within months , but suffered extreme morning sickness – which only swimming eased			1
‘ from six to 15 weeks i was so sick i did n’t want to see the light of day			2
then at 16 weeks a nurse suggested i try swimming , despite being sick , so i dragged myself to the pool and i felt much better			2
i swam four or five times a week until the nausea went away at 21 weeks			0
’ she then returned to her regular gym sessions for an hour four or five times a week			0
@entity1 pictured left with @entity96 and right with @entity9 presenter @entity97 ‘ in the past couple of weeks i ’ve had to slow down as my body is getting tired – it ’s like ploughing through mud			1
so i now walk on the treadmill , go on the cross trainer and bike , plus do a few light weights			0
i do n’t push myself and i do n’t run now as your body releases a hormone to soften the joints so you have to be careful			0
’ @entity1 ’s exercise regime has the approval of her doctors			1
‘ i asked my consultant if it was ok to exercise and he said absolutely yes ; your body will tell you when to stop , so just listen to your body			0
’ this advice echoes that of @entity119 and gynaecologist dr @entity120 , who recently said : ‘ there is no evidence that exercise during pregnancy can damage the baby or cause complications			0
‘ a large round - up of studies in 2010 came to this conclusion – the trials reviewed included vigorous non-contact exercise such as swimming , static cycling and floor - exercise programmes			0
the growing baby is surrounded by fluid in the womb that keeps it well insulated from movement outside			0
’ the @entity136 recommends moderate exercise such as brisk walking , jogging or cycling , three times a week			0
vigorous exercise should be undertaken with caution as the resting heart rate increases during pregnancy			0
the pair have a show booked for just seven weeks after the baby 's birth @entity1 says : ‘ i went for a 36 - week scan and everything is perfect – there ’s a little too much fluid around the baby but doctors are n’t concerned and my blood pressure is fantastic			1
’ once the baby is born @entity1 will be heading straight back to the dancefloor – and the gym – as she and @entity16 have a show booked just seven weeks after the birth			1
‘ it gives me a target			0
i ’ve put on two stone and none of my clothes fit : my thighs are like tree trunks , my boobs are huge and my bum … i ’m not looking backwards in the mirror until the baby is born			0
' the doctors do n’t seem concerned but in my profession it ’s difficult to come to terms with – my career depends on my fitness and weight			0
i ’m being careful about what i eat and will work very hard once the baby ’s born			0
' people may criticise but that ’s my living – so the baby will be in a pushchair as i go running			0
‘ but right now it ’s all about the baby ’s health			0
i ’m really excited and ca n’t wait to meet the little bundle			0
