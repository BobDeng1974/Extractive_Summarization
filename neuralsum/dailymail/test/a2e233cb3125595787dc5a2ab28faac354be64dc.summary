@entity1 manager @entity0 believes a strong finish will put a different slant on @entity4 's season - but he is determined to stop his former manager @entity5 profiting at his old @entity7 stomping ground on saturday			1
@entity5 was lauded by @entity4 fans last season as the club qualified for @entity11 with a fifth - placed finish in the @entity13			2
but the going has been a lot tougher for the @entity16 in his second season on @entity18 with @entity4 having only removed the spectre of relegation by winning their last three matches			0
@entity0 wants @entity1 to continue their own impressive form with victory over @entity4 on saturday @entity24 ( centre ) scored twice for @entity1 in their 3 - 1 victory over @entity27 last weekend @entity28 ( second right ) also got on the scoresheet as @entity1 maintained their impressive form vandals even defaced the outside of @entity34 with ' @entity35 ' and ' not good enough ' sprayed on the wall of a stand in white paint , but @entity0 insists that is simply a part of modern - day football when results do not go your way			1
' i always say you 're only a few games away from being great or rubbish , ' @entity0 said			1
' @entity5 is a good manager , but sometimes you have good periods and sometimes you have bad ones			0
' it 's just making sure you come through them and he 's won the last three games , they 're back on the up and he 'll want to finish the season strongly			1
' of course they 'd want to be pushing further up the league and it 's not a position you 'd associate with @entity4			2
' but if they can get back up to finish positively it will put a different twist on the season			0
' @entity4 have had to balance their domestic commitments with a demanding @entity66 campaign which saw them knocked out at the round - of - 16 stage last month			0
and @entity0 knows from @entity1 being in the competition last season how much that has an impact on @entity13 performances and results			1
' @entity11 is tough , the travelling and constant games in certain periods , ' @entity0 said			2
' it all adds up and the intensity of the football at this level takes it out of you and takes its toll			0
' whether it ( @entity4 's results ) is all down to that i do n't know , but it does play a major part and if you look at the teams who have played in the @entity66 , including ourselves , it has had an impact			1
' @entity1 have never beaten @entity4 in the league but they claimed a point at @entity34 in november after being reduced to 10 men following @entity99 's dismissal			1
@entity5 criticised @entity1 's ' strange ' tactics and style of play that day but @entity103 put it down to ' more frustration with his own side and not winning the game '			2
@entity5 is hoping to continue @entity4 's form against his former team in the @entity13 @entity103 ( right ) holds no ill feeling towards @entity5 , despite him criticising @entity1 after defeat in november ' it might have been a game they 'd targeted to win and when it does n't happen as a manager you do get frustrated , ' said @entity0 , who knows victory will take @entity1 past their previous best @entity13 points total of 47			1
' that 's what it boiled down to			0
but we did well , we had @entity99 sent off so we were never going to go gung - ho and we got a good point			0
' we did well in the circumstances and now we want to go one better and get all three			0

@entity4 have won their last three games and visit @entity1 on saturday
@entity1 manager @entity0 is hoping to stifle @entity4 's revival
@entity1 beat them in november and have been on a good run themselves
