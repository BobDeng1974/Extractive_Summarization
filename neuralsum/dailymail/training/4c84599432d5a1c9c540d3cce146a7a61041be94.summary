legend has it that at the end of every rainbow sits a leprechaun , hammering on a shoe , who will reveal the whereabouts of a crock of gold			2
but if the prospect of that one pot is n't quite enough , sometimes @entity10 offers the chance to pursue two - or even four - as it did in @entity14 today			1
residents in @entity16 were treated to a stunning sight early this morning as an all - but - complete double rainbow fanned across the sky , providing a perfect frame for the seaside town			1
despite heavy rain and dark shadows looming across the sky , the grey ribbons of clouds momentarily parted to allow the semi-circle rainbow to spread across the horizon , revealing both ends of the colourful phenomenon			2
this was the stunning sight which spread across the sky in @entity16 , @entity14 , today , when both ends of a spectacular double rainbow were revealed is it usually expected that someone must be at the height of a mountaintop to see a half - circle rainbow , due to the angle and height that the sun is required to be at			1
sometimes , the full circle can be seen , perhaps during an activity such as sky - dicing			2
due to the mixture of rain and sunshine in the past few days , there have been an array of incredible rainbows pictured around the @entity52			1
there was a spectacular sight over @entity55 in @entity56 yesterday , as a double rainbow appeared to rise out of the sea and arch over the seaside town			1
and an almost - complete rainbow appeared over @entity62 , west @entity63 , yesterday , as wet and windy descended on the area			1
rainbows are caused when sunlight refracts as it enters a raindrop , splitting it into different wavelengths which are seen by the eye as an arc - shaped spectrum of different colors			1
double rainbows occur when the light is reflected as it leaves a raindrop , producing a second , fainter , rainbow nearby , only with the bands of colour reversed			1
the area between the two rainbows is known as ' @entity83 ' , named after @entity84 who first described its occurrence in 200 ad			0
the rainbow has a place in the mythologies of many cultures			0
in @entity92 it was considered to be a path made by a messenger between @entity95 and @entity96			0
for the @entity98 , the rainbow was a slit in the sky sealed by the goddess @entity102 using stones of five different colours			0
for @entity107 aborigines the rainbow serpent is the creator and of course for @entity111 , the rainbow is a pledge from @entity113 not to destroy the world with floods			0
a spectacular rainbow appeared to rise from the sea in @entity56 , @entity118 yesterday , arching its way over the seaside town another rainbow was seen over @entity62 , west @entity63 , yesterday , as wet and windy weather returned to the town the rainbows came as @entity52 braces itself for wet and cold weather over the new few days , with forecasters predicting clear skies but freezing temperatures through to @entity129			1
just five days after basking in the warmest @entity130 on record , @entity52 is braced for temperatures to dip below freezing on @entity129			2
the mercury hit @entity134 ( @entity135 ) in @entity136 and @entity137 on october 31 , but could fall as low as @entity138 ( @entity139 ) in northern @entity140 tomorrow			0
but forecasters said tomorrow ’s weather is quite normal for november , and it will only seem so cold to @entity52 because of the balmy autumn			2
temperatures in urban areas could fall to about @entity145 ( @entity146 ) on november 5 , but dip below freezing to @entity149 ( @entity150 ) in rural areas , the @entity147 said			0
it 's cold ... and it 's getting colder : early morning fog and frost today in @entity156 in @entity157 , @entity158 @entity160 's green and pleasant land : a man walks his dog in front of misty morning view overlooking @entity165 , as sunshine made way for heavy showers and cold temperatures @entity130 on record : just five days ago , on october 31 , this couple were relaxing in the sunshine at @entity136 's @entity173 - but temperatures are set to drop for @entity129 the @entity52 low is likely to be close to the @entity175 ( @entity176 ) seen at the summit of the @entity179 mountain in the @entity180 on @entity129 last year			1
the previous two years saw @entity129 lows of @entity182 ( @entity183 ) at @entity184 , @entity185 , in 2012 , and @entity186 ( @entity187 ) at @entity188 in the @entity180 in 2011			0
last friday the @entity52 record for the warmest @entity130 was smashed , as @entity190 in west @entity136 and @entity191 in @entity137 both hit @entity134 ( @entity135 )			2
this beat the previous high of @entity195 ( @entity196 ) set at @entity197 in @entity137 in 1968			0
conditions were warmer than those in @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202			0
so far , 2014 is the warmest year on record , following consistently mild temperatures which have continued into autumn , according to @entity205 .			0

a spectacular almost - complete double rainbow provided the perfect frame for @entity16 , @entity14 , earlier today
stunning rainbows have been *spotted* across the @entity52 as heavy showers mix with *sporadic* moments of *bright* sunshine
they are caused when sun refracts in a raindrop , splitting it into wavelengths and creating arc - shaped spectrums
