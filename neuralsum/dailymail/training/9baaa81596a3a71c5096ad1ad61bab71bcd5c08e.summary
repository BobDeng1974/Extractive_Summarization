rising energy bills are a political hot topic at the moment but one @entity4 user has devised a way of heating a room for just 8p a day			1
journalist and boat owner @entity7 created his diy heater using tealights placed inside a bread tin and covered with two ceramic flowerpots			1
the system uses the scientific principles of convection heat transfer and @entity7 claims it can heat his home for around eight hours a day			1
in the video , the tealights are put inside a bread loaf tin and covered with a small upside - down flowerpot			2
the hole in the top of the upside - down pot is covered with the metal casing leftover from one of the tealights			2
this pot is covered by a second , larger pot and the hole in the bigger flowerpot is left uncovered			0
the system works because the candles produce gases full of heated particles that are captured and channelled through the pots			2
these hot gas particles are lighter than the gases in the air , meaning they rise up into the colder area			0
this causes the cold air to fall into the warm areas and creates a convection current which transfers heat from one pot to another , and out of the hole on top			1
@entity7 , who posts to @entity4 under the username @entity49 , is a journalist and boat owner			1
he created the @entity53 heater as an alternative way of heating his boat as well as his office at home			1
winter bought tealights from @entity60 that cost £ 1 for 100 , a standard loaf tin , and two different - sized flowerpots			1
the smaller flowerpot , when placed upside down , needs to just cover the centre of the loaf tin , while the larger flowerpot needs to sit comfortably over the smaller one			0
in the video explaining how to build the heater , @entity7 lights four of the candles and places them inside the tin			1
he places the smaller flowerpot upside down on top of the tin and covers the hole in the pot with one of the metal cases leftover from the tealights			2
the larger flowerpot is then placed on top of the smaller one , and its hole is left uncovered			0

this pot is covered by a second , larger pot and the hole in the bigger flowerpot is left uncovered journalist and boat owner @entity7 , pictured , created his diy heater using tealights , a loaf tin and two ceramic flowerpots			1
in the video , pictured , @entity7 places the tealights inside the small tin before lighting them @entity7 explains that the heat from the candles warms the inside of the smaller flowerpot , which becomes an ‘ inner core ’ that gets ‘ very hot			1
’ a ‘ convection of air ’ is then created between the smaller and larger pots and this heated air comes out the top of the homemade heater			1

the hole in the top of the pot is covered with the metal casing leftover from one of the tealights this causes the cold air to fall into the warm areas and creates a convection current which transfers heat from the pots and through the hole in the top			1
@entity7 said : ‘ people have told me that judicious positioning of flowerpots help to make the heating more efficient			2
i did not believe it but it really does seem to work			0
' you get a nice flow around the [ pots ] and it warms the room up			2
’ @entity49 works for @entity148 magazine and claims he uses the @entity53 heater on his boat			1
each tealight burns for around four hours , and @entity7 uses four tealights in the morning , and four in the afternoon to heat his rooms for eight hours a day			1

the system works because the candles produce gases full of heated particles that are captured and channelled through the pots however , station manager @entity165 , from the @entity164 ’s investigation team , warned against using the homemade heater			2
' this heating system is unsafe			0
as a fire investigator , i see dozens of fires every year , including fatal fires , that are caused by people using alternative forms of heating and lighting , most of which include a naked flame			0
' candles and tea lights can be extremely dangerous – a small gust of wind can cause an innocent candle flame to set light to objects nearby if left too close			0
' we understand that some people may be struggling to pay fuel bills , but we ’d urge everyone to think carefully about their safety and the safety of those around them before using candles to heat their homes			0

@entity4 user @entity7 created the @entity53 heater for his boat and office
he used tealights that cost £ 1 for a pack of 100 plus two *basic* ceramic pots
the process uses the theory of convection heat transfer to warm a room
tealights burn for around four hours in the morning and afternoon
