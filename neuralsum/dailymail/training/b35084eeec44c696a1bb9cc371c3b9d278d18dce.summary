@entity0 refused 13 times yesterday to back @entity3 ’s proposal for ‘ home rule ’ for @entity5			1
as the fallout from @entity10 ’s independence referendum threatened to engulf both main political parties , the @entity7 leader repeatedly declined to agree that @entity10 mps should be barred from voting on laws that only affect @entity5			1
he warned that the move would create two classes of mp – and suggested it could ‘ drive our country apart ’			0
however , there has been a backlash among his own mps , many of whom warn that the party could be seen as ‘ anti-english ’ unless it supports reform that gives the country the same rights promised to @entity10			1
he claims he went to see mr @entity0 as far back as 2010 and warned him about ‘ the @entity5 question ’ – but was ignored			1
and @entity7 mp @entity45 said preventing @entity10 mps from voting on issues that affect only @entity5 was ‘ the right thing to do ’			1
the prime minister will hold a ‘ council of war ’ at @entity49 on monday with more than 20 senior conservatives			0
@entity52 , which yesterday insisted mr @entity3 will deliver on his pledge to devolve further powers to the @entity42 come what may , is seeking to head off a @entity57 revolt over the last - ditch promises made to the @entity10 to help win last week ’s no vote on independence			1
barring @entity10 mps from voting on key affairs would permanently cripple @entity7 ’s power base at @entity63 because of the party ’s heavy reliance on the support of its 41 mps north of the border			1
mr @entity0 and his wife @entity69 were both in @entity71 for a fringe meeting at the @entity7 conference @entity7 has 41 mps in @entity10 which could help it form a majority at next year 's general election at the last election , the @entity57 won 296 of 533 seats in @entity5 – and would have had an overall majority of 59 if @entity10 mps were excluded			1
yesterday , as the row overshadowed the opening of the @entity7 conference in @entity71 , mr @entity0 was asked 13 times by the @entity84 ’s @entity83 whether he backed the idea of ‘ @entity5 votes for @entity5 laws ’ , but refused to give a direct answer			1
under pressure , he suggested he might be open to a system of allowing @entity5 mps greater ‘ scrutiny ’ of new laws that only affect @entity5			1
but he said that should be considered by a ‘ constitutional convention ’ that would begin next year after a @entity7 election victory			1
‘ i am in favour of one @entity97 with 650 mps because , goodness , we fought tooth and nail over the last two years to avoid our @entity42 being split up and our @entity103 being split up and i want to make sure that does n’t happen , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’m not against the idea of greater scrutiny of legislation that particularly affects @entity5 by @entity5 mps			1
‘ but we ca n’t do it in a back - of - the - envelope , fag packet way			1
let ’s not drive our country apart because @entity3 believes it is an opportunity for him to do it			2
’ @entity57 chairman @entity114 told @entity115 that mr @entity3 ’s idea was ‘ common sense ’			1
however , former @entity7 deputy prime minister @entity118 described the plan as a ‘ @entity57 trick ’ designed to ‘ fix ’ @entity63 in the party ’s favour			1
a @entity124 poll for the @entity35 found that two in three @entity5 voters believe mps representing @entity10 seats at @entity63 should be banned from voting on issues such as health and education			1
just one in five oppose the move			0
@entity3 , @entity0 and @entity133 made ' a vow ' to the @entity10 people to transfer new powers to @entity137 evasion one @entity83 : it seems fairly clear that you have been put into a trap – either you agree with the prime minister and support @entity5 votes for @entity5 laws ... or you will be part of leaders getting together and fumbling it and reneging on the pact you ’ve given to the @entity10 people			1
how do you get out of that trap ? @entity0 : well i want to come to the detail of that in a minute , but i want to make a broader point , which is a very , very important point for the future of our country			2
i think there is a huge danger that the political class is learning the wrong lessons from this referendum			0
@entity83 : so @entity3 has connected that promise to @entity5 votes for @entity5 laws and a huge number of people in @entity5 say yes that is fair , it is absolutely fair ; why should @entity10 mps be able to vote on taxes in @entity5 if @entity5 @entity166 are n’t able to vote on taxes in @entity10 ? they ’re right about that , are n’t they ? @entity172 @entity0 : well let ’s be very clear about what @entity3 has done			1
he will have to speak for himself in the coming days			0
but what @entity175 said very , very clearly on the radio on friday morning was that these two processes , they wanted them to run in parallel			0
@entity83 : in a principled way , what is wrong with @entity5 votes for @entity5 laws ? it ’s fair , is n’t it , it ’s fair play ? evasion three @entity0 : well i think that we ’ve got to look at all of the constitutional issues that have been thrown up			1
@entity83 : but i ’m asking a very specific question here			0
@entity193 @entity0 : i know and i ’m going to come to it			2
look i think there is a big problem , which is that power has been devolved in @entity10 , power has been devolved in @entity199 , but governments of both parties have failed to devolve power in @entity5			1
now the first answer to that question is not to change the nature of the centralised power of @entity63 over @entity5			2
it is to devolve power in @entity5 and that is absolute			2
@entity83 : but @entity5 is a country			2
@entity5 is a nation herself ... @entity0 : absolutely , absolutely			1
@entity83 : and there is no reason , in fairness , why @entity10 mps should be able to vote on @entity5 laws if it ca n’t happen the other way around			1
evasion five @entity0 : absolutely			2
and we ... @entity83 : i want to keep on this very , very important principled question			0
@entity222 @entity0 : ... and we ’ve got to look at all of these issues			2
@entity83 : would you accept @entity5 votes for @entity5 laws , as it ’s called , or not ? @entity228 @entity0 : we ’ll look ... at any proposals come forward with			1
let me just say ... @entity83 : it ’s a very straightforward question			0
@entity233 @entity0 : well and i ’m going to ... i ’m going to explain			2
and i tell you what , there is n’t a simple answer to this question			0
@entity83 : yes there is			0
@entity0 : no there is n’t			2
@entity83 : i ’m sorry , yes or no ? it ’s very straightforward			0
evasion nine @entity0 : no , there is n’t a simple answer			2
we ’ve been wrestling with this issue for 120 years , ever since we were talking about @entity248 home rule around a century ago			0
now what is the issue ? when you devolve power to some parts of the country in different ways to others , it throws up these questions			0
so , for example , let me give you another example			0
@entity262 @entity166 vote on transport issues outside @entity262 , but @entity5 @entity166 outside @entity262 do n’t vote on transport issues in @entity262 , because they ’re devolved ... @entity83 : that ’s inside a country			2
i ’m just asking again			0
the principled case against an @entity268			0
@entity0 : well hang on a minute , we are a country , we are a @entity103			0
now the way i ... what i say about this is i am open to the idea of greater scrutiny of legislation by @entity5 mps			1
@entity83 : this ... i ’m sorry to cut in , but the truth is that you ’re against @entity5 votes for @entity5 laws because @entity7 would n’t dominate			1
surely the answer to that is for @entity7 to do better in @entity5 ... not to refuse @entity5 people this basic justice ? @entity286 @entity0 : i ’ve got to say to you , that ’s not the history			1
i mean , look , the history is that when @entity7 has won majorities across the @entity103 , we ’ve won majorities in @entity5 too			1
i think it ’s about this			0
i think it ’s about the fact that we do n’t play fast and loose with our constitution , we do change in the right way			0
@entity83 : so i return again			0
is there a principled case against , in effect , an @entity268 , or not ? @entity304 @entity0 : well i ’m not in favour of a new parliament and a new tier of politicians			2
i do n’t think that ’s the answer , i ’ve got to say to you			0
and i am in favour of one @entity97 with 650 mps because , goodness , we fought tooth and nail over the last two years to avoid our parliament being split up and our @entity103 being split up			2
@entity83 : you ’re using the word ‘ scrutiny ’			0
i ’m wondering about votes really			0
evasion twelve @entity0 : well , let me make this point			0
well , there are two points to this			0
first of all , in practice the reality is it ’s very hard to separate out legislation			0
take tuition fees in @entity5 , right			0
you might say that ’s an @entity5 - only issue			1
it has knock - on effects for @entity10 as well in terms of public spending			2
is that an @entity5 - only issue or a more universally applying issue ? secondly , i ’m not in favour of a @entity97 that becomes divided			1
@entity83 : but ... then you carry on with the injustice of @entity10 mps			2
@entity345 @entity0 : no , no. no you look at it ... no , because you look at this issue in a calm , measured , correct way through a process , through a constitutional convention			0
i mean , goodness , we ’ve been wrestling with this issue for 100 years			0
of course we should take our time and look at this properly .			0

@entity0 says he is open to @entity5 - only ' scrutiny ' of law but not *vetoes*
he refused to back @entity5 votes for @entity5 laws after being asked 13 times
mr @entity0 claims move was drawn up on back of a ' fag packet ' by the *pm*
@entity3 said if @entity10 gets new powers so should @entity5
but mr @entity0 said the proposal would mean our ' @entity42 being split up '
mr @entity0 says he 's ' not in favour of a commons that becomes divided '
@entity7 has 41 mps in @entity10 which could help it form a majority next year
