they have been told to be positive at all times , but @entity2 had to dig deep before they could have the desired effect at @entity9 ’s when faced with a combination of one of the greatest batsmen in history and a featherbed pitch			0
even the best bowlers of all time may have struggled against @entity12 on the third day of the first test once he had decided that this was the day when he would finally make his first test century at the home of cricket			2
yet , when @entity17 , almost out of nowhere , forced an edge from a rare loose @entity12 shot to end his latest high quality century and claim a notable first test wicket , @entity2 suddenly looked capable of claiming a decisive advantage			1
what a way to start ! @entity17 is congratulated after taking the wicket of @entity12 pouched : prior ( left ) shows good hands to catch @entity25 off the bowling of @entity17 getting the jump on him : @entity29 ( right ) leaps on his team - mate @entity12 to celebrate the ton honoured : @entity12 ( second left ) celebrates his century - and getting himself on to the famous lord 's board going over the top : @entity12 hits out during his majestic innings of 147 a dab hand : @entity12 nurdles the ball down to the third man boundary they made two further inroads on a day when each wicket had to be hard - earned and , with @entity41 at 415 for seven , still 160 behind , there may yet be an interesting finish to a test that had seemed certain to end in a high - scoring draw			1
this was an attritional day ’s test cricket , with the balance tipping too far towards bat rather than ball , at least until @entity2 took three wickets in a final session which said much for their ability to stick to their task			0
certainly an @entity2 attack that included two debutants in @entity59 and @entity17 , plus a man playing his first test in seven years in @entity62 , initially had little answer to @entity12 on what is likely to be his last lord ’s appearance			1
it was left to @entity2 ’s principal bowlers , @entity69 and @entity70 , to stem the early flood of runs with the first three wickets to fall on the third day on a pitch that has seemed too batsman - friendly			1
when the truly great batsmen are assessed it is not often that @entity12 features highly on any list that includes @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 , yet his record stands up against the very best			0
it is extraordinary to think that none of @entity78 , @entity85 or @entity81 ever made a @entity61 hundred at @entity87 and in doing so yesterday , the @entity88 became the first man to score three @entity61 hundreds in successive innings on three separate occasions			1
he is one serious performer			0
perhaps it is because @entity12 has a poorer record against @entity2 that he can be under - rated here , yet there was an inevitability about his destiny in finally getting his name on the famous lord ’s honours board at 36			0
he warmed - up by making a hundred here in the one - day series two weeks ago but this was the one he really wanted , celebrating in emotional fashion with his fellow great @entity29			1
@entity105 : @entity59 jumps for joy after taking the wicket of @entity108 back with a bang : @entity62 ( left ) celebrates the wicket of @entity111 on his @entity61 return safe hands : @entity114 ( second left ) is congratulated by his team - mates after catching @entity116 reaching out : @entity69 tries to grab the ball off his own bowling by that time @entity2 knew their chances of forcing a win were diminishing and until @entity17 struck they appeared powerless to do anything to stop @entity41 replying with gusto to their massive 575 for nine			1
@entity2 want @entity61 groundsmen to provide pitches with pace and bounce this season but there was little of that in @entity130 ’s low , slow , tired surface that , while it may guarantee five days of lucrative test cricket , does little for the spectacle			1
this was more like @entity135 than @entity136 and that suited @entity41 as they attempted to repeat their escape here in 2006 , when they earned a draw after @entity2 had scored their previous high against them of 551 for six			0
pulling power : @entity143 turns a short delivery into the leg side early strike : @entity69 ( centre ) celebrates the wicket of @entity148 in the first half an hour of the day it took a cracking ball from @entity69 and a decent catch from @entity153 to give @entity2 their first breakthrough of the day and their second in the innings , sending back @entity148 , but from that moment life became tougher for them			1
@entity12 was joined by a batsman almost as great himself in @entity29 and together the gifted pair added 126 with such consummate ease that it looked feasible then for @entity41 to claim a first innings lead of their own			2
it was apt that when @entity12 finally went to that 36th test hundred but first on this ground that @entity29 should be at his side , his great friend rushing to leap on him and join the celebrations as @entity12 basked in the adulation			1
@entity174 heads could have dropped but , to their credit , they kept working hard for wickets and captain @entity177 did all he could by ringing the bowling changes and coming up with various fielding combinations			0
ducking out : @entity148 sways out of the way of an @entity69 bouncer dark days : black clouds passed over @entity9 's in the afternoon @entity29 was absolutely plumb to @entity70 and wasted a review by officially questioning the decision , and the second new ball then claimed another victim when @entity116 lobbed @entity69 tamely to mid-wicket			1
but the big breakthrough was also the most unexpected when @entity17 , still more a batsman than bowler but a very promising off - spinner , got some turn and bounce to force a big edge from @entity12 ’s attempted cut			2
prior did the rest with another good catch and the @entity88 door was slightly ajar for @entity2			0
as @entity12 has nine test double centuries to his name and scored 319 in his last test against @entity203 , a score of 147 was almost a failure and he was quickly followed by @entity111 , @entity206 taking a brilliant reflex catch at leg slip to give @entity62 his first @entity61 wicket since @entity210 seven years ago			1
when @entity59 nipped in to take @entity108 ’s edge and claim his second wicket , @entity2 could be satisfied with their day but they still have much more positive work to do if they are to go to @entity214 one up in this two - @entity61 series			2
when @entity153 ( right ) took a smart catch high to his right to get rid of @entity41 opener @entity148 , he and @entity69 became @entity2 ’s leading bowler - wicketkeeper combination with 61 dismissals			1
the pair overtook @entity222 and @entity223 as the most prolific partnership			0
@entity12 's dream ton @entity12 had scored 35 @entity61 hundreds before this match but had never scored one at @entity87			1
he changed that yesterday with a masterful ton for which he was warmly embraced by his old friend and batting partner @entity29			2
both men have said this will be their last tour of @entity2 as players			0
@entity238 block @entity2 's @entity236 plea @entity2 's bid to use @entity236 video technology in next month ’s @entity241 against @entity238 has been blocked			0
@entity2 officials asked @entity238 , the only cricket - playing nation not to employ @entity236 , to consider its introduction for the four - @entity61 series in the hope that @entity78 ’s retirement would encourage a change in position			2
@entity78 ’s distrust of @entity236 - introduced in 2009 to allow players to challenge to umpires ’ decisions - had been the main reason for @entity238 refusing to allow its use in any series they play.but @entity238 refuse to budge , which will be a blow to @entity260 chairman @entity259			0
lights out at @entity87 an unexpected power cut at @entity87 caused consternation on and off the field yesterday			2
the lights went out twice after lunch , causing both electric scoreboards to stop functioning			0
panicked ground staff placed an old - school wooden scorebox from the @entity270 under the media centre which had also lost power .			0

@entity274 scored 147 , his first test hundred at @entity87
@entity17 had him caught behind by @entity153 for maiden @entity61 wicket
@entity69 had opener @entity148 caught behind early on
@entity29 hit 55 , @entity143 in 79 not out
@entity62 took his first @entity61 wicket for seven years
