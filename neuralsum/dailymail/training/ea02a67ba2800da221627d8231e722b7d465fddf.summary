two managers have been suspended after a hospital trust admitted discharging hundreds of suspected cancer patients by mistake			1
@entity4 said at least one person might have died as a result of the errors and 121 patients are yet to have their cases reviewed			1
a £ 40,000 external investigation is under way at the trust , which is made up of @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
an independent investigation into the blunders at the @entity4 has revealed a @entity19 warned there could be a major problem in november 2012 - a full year before the @entity4 launched its investigation in one case where a patient died , the trust said it was thought a delay in seeing them might have contributed to their death			1
it is now in the process of contacting the family of a second patient who has since died			0
that patient had advanced cancer at the stage the initial referral was made			0
in another case , a patient had their diagnosis delayed due to errors but their cancer was found at the earliest stage			2
overall , 810 people have had their cases reviewed			1
of these , 686 have been told there are no clinical concerns about the care they received			1
the mistakes came to light in november when @entity50 , who took over from mr @entity51 as chief executive last february , asked for a review of the system for booking cancer appointments			2
a review by the trust , which runs @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity14 hospitals , found that 686 people were not harmed by the delays			1
it is investigating other 121 cases and speaking to doctors and relatives			2
none turned up for their initial examinations however , possibly because they did not receive appointment letters			0
given the urgency of their cases , staff should have contacted them immediately to arrange another slot			0
former chief executive : @entity51 left in late 2012 and moved on to @entity75 , @entity76 instead , it is thought they were removed from the computer system with no further action taken			1
the blunders made some patients wait several weeks for diagnosis – with fatal results in two cases			1
patients who missed their first appointment and were recorded as not showing up were discharged by the hospital			0
@entity90 rules say patients should always be offered a second appointment			0
the patients had been referred for urgent appointments by doctors between january 2010 and november 2013			0
the trust announced today that a £ 40,000 external review is being carried out by four authorities , including @entity99 and the @entity100			1
it said it had offered patients ' our apologies for any anxiety and distress ' caused by the events and had implemented a new it system to track each patient ’s appointment , missed appointments and cancellations			0
trust chief executive @entity50 said : ' it is absolutely clear that the trust was not always following the correct administrative processes for these patients and we let them down			2
' these concerns date back a number of years and were identified as part of the new management team ’s commitment to improve the way we administer and manage patient care			2
' i would like to apologise to each and every patient who has been affected and particularly to the relatives of those who have since died			0
the mistakes came to light in november when @entity50 , who took over from mr @entity51 as chief executive last february , asked for a review of the system for booking cancer appointments ' we have of course made significant changes to help prevent this ever happening again and will share the outcome of our investigations with those affected and with the wider public			2
' the trust said it is ' confident ' it has contacted everyone affected by the errors but anyone concerned should contact their gp or call the trust ’s information line on 01923 217100			0
health minister dr @entity149 said today the errors were ' very worrying and clearly unacceptable '			0
he said : ' what has happened at @entity4 is very worrying and clearly unacceptable			2
' every patient in the @entity90 expects and deserves the very best care to give them the highest possible chance of surviving cancer			0
' an independent review has been set up to investigate the issue urgently , and the @entity158 will be monitoring the situation closely on the ground			0
' the new and independent chief inspector of hospitals will be looking at the quality of care for patients - including cancer care - in his ongoing programme of inspections			1
' this government is also making the deliberate falsification of hospital records a criminal offence as part of our new emphasis on transparency and openness in the @entity90			0
' it also emerged last night that the man who was in charge at the time quit the @entity183 just as the problems were coming to light			1
@entity51 , who had moved on to @entity75 , suddenly left the @entity76 hospital in december , saying he wanted to pursue ‘ other opportunities ’			1
he takes with him a £ 3million taxpayer - funded pension pot. the mistakes affected 810 patients urgently referred to the @entity192 trust for tests between 2010 and 2013 because their gp feared they had cancer			1
a few weeks later , mr @entity51 , 62 , announced he was going to retire just a year into his @entity75 posting			1
the married father of two gave up a £ 280,000 annual salary , saying he wanted to focus on @entity90 consultancy and business books			0
he was handed a retirement lump sum payment of £ 412,000 on top of his £ 140,000 - a - year pension – one of the most generous in the public sector			2
speaking from his £ 1.3million home in @entity206 , @entity76 , last night mr @entity51 said : ‘ i ’m not prepared to comment having no knowledge about the issues and it being some time since i left the trust			1
