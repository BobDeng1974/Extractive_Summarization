no fit state : 2,000 patients failed to get non-urgent surgery in the first three months of the year alone , because of lack of beds or cancellations at @entity10 of @entity2 its report says : * children are being fitted with hearing aids because of a lack of time and resources to insert grommets to treat ear infections * patients are suffering complications because of delays in treating kidney stones * @entity34 and intensive care units are ' frequently gridlocked ' with patients ' often stacked up in corridors and ambulances '			1

in cardiac surgery we heard that patients are regularly dying on the waiting list from their cardiac pathology , mostly valvular disease ' it says			2
the @entity7 report came following a visit to surgical departments by its @entity60 ( @entity61 ) in april this year			0
the report from the @entity7 also found failures in the cleaning and sterilisation of theatre equipment it highlighted a ' universal consensus ' among clinicians that some services at the hospital were dangerous and of poor quality			1
the perception among doctors , it said , was that operations are being cut to save money and meet financial targets			0
increased waiting lists mean patients are regularly dying from their cardiac pathology before surgery some services had been effectively suspended ' such as paediatric tonsillectomy and children are now regularly being fitted with hearing aids because there is no ability to do grommet insertion instead			1

health board chief executive @entity123 apologised for performance at the hospital and confirmed that 15 people had died in the 12 months while on the waiting list for heart surgery			1
but he rejected calls to resign			0
