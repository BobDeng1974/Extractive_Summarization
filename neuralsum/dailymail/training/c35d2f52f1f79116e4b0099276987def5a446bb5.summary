by @entity0 @entity2 ’ @entity1 , the man set to replace @entity3 in saturday ’s @entity5 final , is preparing for the biggest game of his life			1
the 18st heavily - bearded former @entity9 second row , who played in the same school cricket team as @entity13 batsman @entity12 , is no household name in @entity15			1
but the 6ft 7in giant could be by 7pm on saturday when @entity2 will be crowned @entity18 champions if they beat @entity21 ’s star - studded @entity19 in @entity22			2
stepping up : @entity1 could start in the @entity5 final following an injury to @entity3 school mates : @entity13 cricketer @entity12 played cricket with @entity2 lock @entity27 ‘ i try not to let the occasion overwhelm me and i try to keep my preparation pretty consistent , ’ said the 28 - year - old , ‘ but if you look at it , it probably is the biggest game of my life			1
’ @entity36 , @entity2 ’ director of rugby , tried to be positive about @entity3 ’s injury situation yesterday , insisting the former @entity15 captain still had a 50 - 50 chance of playing after aggravating a pectoral muscle injury in last saturday ’s @entity43 semi-final win over @entity44			1
but other club sources hint that the likelihood of the 34 - year - old playing at the @entity47 — or at @entity48 in the @entity43 final a week later — are considerably slimmer			0
a final call will be made on thursday			2
@entity3 has n’t trained all week , ’ said @entity36			2
‘ if he does n’t play it would just prove that life ’s unfair			0
’ if @entity3 does not recover , the likelihood is @entity1 will partner fellow @entity58 - born lock @entity57 in @entity2 ’ second row as they seek to lift the @entity5 for the first time			1
concerns : @entity2 captain @entity3 suffered a shoulder injury at @entity62 on saturday ‘ we all owe a duty to @entity3 , ’ @entity1 said			1
‘ he is such an important part of this club and the evolution of this club , but you can never replace a guy of that calibre directly			0
’ on saturday @entity1 stepped in for @entity57 at short notice after the former @entity15 lock had a back spasm in the warm - up			2
@entity1 went on to produce a near - faultless display as @entity2 came from behind to secure a place in the @entity43 final against @entity78 on may 31			1
the four - times capped @entity9 from @entity80 , a popular figure at @entity62 , is a multi-talented sportsman who could have played cricket for a living			1
‘ i was a decent all - rounder , ’ said @entity1 , whose beard is almost a match for that sported by his old chum @entity12			1
‘ i was at @entity90 which has a proud cricket history and i was fortunate to play on the same side as @entity12 because bowling at him in the nets was n’t fun			2
you ’d end up chasing leather all afternoon			0
‘ his average as a schoolboy was in the 90s and he ’s gone on to be consistently among the best batsmen in the world			0
he was quiet , humble			0
everything you could ask for from a world - class sportsman			0
farewell : captain @entity3 played his last game at @entity62 with the hard - fought win over @entity44 ‘ people rub off on you as you grow up			1
how you grow up and the people you grow up with shape you and i ’d like to think he has had some influence on my career , although not directly			0
’ @entity1 is to be married back home in @entity80 in the middle of june but before then he faces two games that could define his career , against @entity19 and @entity78 — the sides who knocked @entity2 out of the two major tournaments at the semi-final stage last year			1
‘ i hope we ’ve learnt from last year and we ’ll have a couple of new tricks up our sleeves			0
the occasion wo n’t get the better of us like it possibly did last year , ’ said @entity1			2
he and his team - mates will fly to @entity22 on saturday morning — though goalkickers @entity126 and @entity128 will travel the previous day by private jet to practise under the closed @entity47 roof			0
‘ we like our players to sleep in their own beds the night before a game , ’ @entity36 explained			0
@entity134 will start on the wing for @entity2 against @entity19 after receiving a written warning from the @entity137 for his crass attempt to distract @entity44 ’ @entity139 , who was about to kick for goal , by shouting at him			1
‘ it ’s been dealt with and we move on , ’ @entity36 said			0
flourish : @entity15 hopeful @entity134 will be hoping to continue his try - scoring form in the @entity5			0

@entity2 lock @entity1 played cricket with @entity12
@entity27 could start @entity5 final after injury to @entity3
