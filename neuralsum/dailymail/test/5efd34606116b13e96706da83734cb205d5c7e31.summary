nearly 15 years ago an amazing story emerged of how a young @entity2 woman had travelled half - way across the world to try and find a suitcase stuffed with $ 1m dollars that had been buried in the snow			1
it was claimed that @entity9 had believed the film @entity11 was real - after all the hit movie begins with the words ' this is a true story - when she was found dead in a mini-skirt and high - heeled boots in the frozen wastes of @entity18 just days after arriving			1
this was all confirmed by a police officer from the small town of @entity22 , who said he had spoken to the 28 - year - old shortly after she turned up			2
he said she kept repeating the words ' @entity27 , @entity27 '			2
now @entity9 's incredible story has been made into a film of its own - @entity32 , the @entity33 - newly released by @entity59 filmmakers , and brothers , @entity60 and @entity61 - that dramatizes the myth of her journey and sad end			1
what is certain is that @entity9 's body was found by a hunter in some woodland near @entity22 , a town in @entity18 some 50 miles east of the real town of @entity27 , in the neighbouring state of @entity48 , in november 2001			1
but she did n't die in search of the cash buried in front of a roadside fence under the snow by @entity43 's character in the 1996 @entity45 film			1
@entity79 , a @entity80 based in @entity81 who in 2003 released his own documentary about @entity9 , this is a @entity83 , travelled to the area in the midwest region of the @entity59 to find out what really happened			2
the short film comprises a series of stills in which actress @entity90 plays @entity9 and the actual cops involved , @entity92 and @entity93 , play themselves			2
@entity79 told @entity94 : ' the @entity45 started it really by putting the line " this is a true story " at the start of @entity27			1
@entity97 used an actress to play @entity9 in his 2003 film this is a @entity83 , which told the real tale @entity90 in @entity79 's film ( left ) and @entity30 in the @entity61 brothers ' new release ( right ) in the new film @entity9 sets out with a crudely drawn treasure map across the frozen tundra of @entity18 in search of her mythical fortune a still from this is a @entity83 in which @entity9 's body is depicted exactly as it was found , right down to the black thigh boots , miniskirt and coat which she was wearing despite the freezing temperatures ' it was a half joke , half trick			1
they were making a joke about how people love to believe a story is real			0
' when the story of @entity9 came out the mix between fiction and reality started by the @entity45 , that fuelled the whole story in a way			1
' on his mission to research his film , @entity79 stayed in the very same motel in @entity131 , the state capitol of @entity48 , where @entity9 checked in during her stay			2
he said : ' i had the very same room that she stayed in before she died but i had to call the clerk and say " this is too strange " and get another room			0
' there was a @entity141 night clerk , which is strange enough in itself out there , and there certainly were n't too many @entity2 people passing through so he remembered her			0
' i was the one who actually told him she had died			0
i think he quite liked her because he remembered her really well			0
she was such a mysterious figure			0
' @entity79 's breakthrough came when he met officer @entity153 of the @entity154 , who 'd spoken with @entity155 for four hours before her death			2
he said : ' the news stories at the time said this @entity2 woman had been found dead in a field near @entity27 and quoted the local police as saying that basically she had this map and went to a police station with it			2
' it had a road and a tree on it and she kept pointing at it and saying " @entity11 "			0
officer @entity92 interpreted it as she was trying to find this money			0
the fantastical story of how @entity9 travelled all the way from @entity53 in search of the lost money began to spread not long after her death			1
this is a still from @entity32 , the @entity33 @entity79 ( right ) told @entity94 : ' the @entity45 started it really by putting the line " this is a true story " ( left ) at the start of @entity27 ' a scene from @entity180 is a true story			1
officer @entity153 actually spoke with the real @entity9 before she died the @entity184 ' new film has been a critical success but is no more a true story than @entity27 itself ' @entity9 did n't speak any @entity54 and the police did n't speak any @entity2 so basically they made it up - they did n't lie about it , it was like a game of telephone [ @entity193 whispers ]			1
' ' it was really interesting to find out that " wait a second , the story that everyone believed is completely wrong "			0
' so the story of @entity9 , which sprung from the outlandish tale of the film @entity27 , was based on a simple misunderstanding			1
and yet this has n't stopped @entity32 , released in february in the @entity141 and starring @entity30 as a version of @entity9 , become a critical hit			1
the truth about how a young @entity2 woman came to freeze to death thousands of miles from home in temperatures of @entity212 , while wearing the absurd outfit of a miniskirt , thigh boots and black coat , is actually even more sad than the mythical version			2
@entity9 had apparently been chasing an @entity59 banker she 'd met in @entity53 who 'd moved to @entity220 and was originally from the town of @entity27			1
the story of @entity9 , which sprung from the outlandish tale of @entity27 , was based on a misunderstanding in @entity32 , the @entity33 , the 28 - year - old meets up with local cops just as she did in real life @entity22 in @entity18			1
@entity9 's body was found by a hunter in woodland not far from the small town the relationship ended but he was the last person she spoke to the night before she died , spending $ 88 on a 40 - minute call to @entity220 which @entity79 managed to trace			1
a suicide letter to her parents said she had gone to the hometown of her ex lover to die and toxicology reports found she had drunk two bottles of champagne and simply lain down in the snow			0
@entity79 traced her home address to the @entity244 district of @entity53 using police records and managed to speak to her landlady			0
he said : ' @entity9 came to @entity53 from the country			0
she was a regular girl who came to the big city to live and try to live a good life and it all went wrong			0
' she worked at a travel agency and lost that job and then apparently worked as a dancer			0
' she met this guy and i do n't know if she was obsessed with him or in love but everything went wrong			0
he was the last person she spoke to			0
