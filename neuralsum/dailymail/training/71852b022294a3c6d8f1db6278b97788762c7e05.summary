@entity0 is reportedly preparing to invest £ 12 million in @entity1			1
despite not yet having a source of revenue , more than 100 million users use the app - which is apparently enough to convince companies to spend vast sums out on the three - year old startup			1
@entity0 ’s move follows an almost identical investment from venture capital firm @entity11 and @entity12 in august			1
the @entity13 reports that @entity14 - based @entity0 ( ceo @entity15 shown making her keynote address in january 2014 ) will invest £ 12 million ( $ 20 million ) in the three year - old tech startup @entity1			1
if true the investment would value the company at £ 6 billion ( $ 10 billion ) the move comes after a similar , albeit much larger , investment in @entity22 technology firm @entity20 reaped huge dividends for @entity0 , with its $ 1 billion investment in 40 per cent of the company in 2005 now valued at tens of billions of dollars			1
this latest move , according to the @entity13 , comes as @entity1 starts to seek funding from venture - capital firms , money managers and companies			1
earlier this year @entity31 launched a new ephemeral messaging app called @entity33			0
the app , which functions in a similar way to @entity1 , allows users to quickly share self destructing photos or videos with a friend			2
like @entity1 , the user can tap on a friend 's face to instantly send a photo , or hold their finger down to send a video			0
however , @entity33 only allows you to send messages to one person at a time , which makes it frustrating if you ’re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends			0
the favourites bar at the bottom of the app also only contains four friends , though you can apparently add up to 20 contacts in total			0
@entity33 is currently only available in @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 ahead of a planned release in the rest of the world			0
snapchat may be a key partner to @entity0 as it gets set to release @entity70 next year			2
this is a rumoured service that will display brief ads alongside news and video clips on the app , which will likely become a key source of revenue for @entity1			1
@entity70 would provide a platform for @entity0 to distribute its own content			2
however , the £ 6 billion ( $ 10 billion ) valuation of a company that has n't , yet , monetised its users , has been dubbed a risky proposition			1
that ’s not to say it has n’t worked before ; @entity87 ’s 2007 investment in @entity88 valued the then three - year old company at £ 9.4 billion ( $ 15 billion ) , and later proved hugely successful			1
last year @entity1 infamously turned down a £ 1.8 billion ( $ 3 billion ) offer from @entity88 - a decision that left many stunned			1
but the move seems to have paid off , as @entity1 ’s owners @entity93 and @entity94 are set to become billionaires according to the current valuations of the company			0
if the valuation holds true , @entity1 would join a select club of tech startups with valuations of £ 6 billion ( $ 10 billion ) or more , including car - ride service uber and rooms - to - let startup @entity104			1
@entity0 's move follows an almost identical investment from venture capital firm @entity11 and @entity12 in august this year			1
however @entity1 is still yet to announce how it plans to make revenue from its more than 100 million users			2
pictured are owners @entity93 , left , and @entity94 @entity1 lets users send photo - messages that vanish within seconds , but is expected to soon begin offering advertising or branch out into additional services			2
this may include the ability to send instant money transfers to other users			0
although @entity1 , and other similar mobile messaging apps , do n't have established business models yet , its rapid user growth and perceptions of advertising potential have aroused intense investor interest over the past year or so			2
@entity1 is continuing to grow in popularity , with people sending more than 700 million disappearing messages a day			0
in june , @entity88 launched a similar app called @entity130 in the hope of replicating @entity1 ’s success			0
the app lets consumers exchange photos and videos , which later disappear , without requiring @entity88 accounts			0
but despite its rapid growth , @entity1 has had a number of obstacles to contend with			0
the group this year settled charges with @entity145 regulators , which accused it of deceiving consumers by promising that photos sent on its service disappeared forever after a period of time			0
according to the @entity154 at the time , photos sent on @entity1 could , in fact , be saved by recipients using several methods , such as taking a screenshot .			0

reports claim @entity0 is to invest £ 12 million ( $ 20 million ) in @entity1
if true , the investment would value the startup at £ 6 billion ( $ 10 billion )
it follows an almost identical investment from venture capital firm @entity167 in august
@entity1 has n't announced how it plans to make money from its users
rumours *suggest* it will soon *introduce* news and adverts to the service
this could include @entity70 next year - a service that will display brief adverts alongside news and video clips on the app
