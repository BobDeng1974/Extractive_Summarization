by @entity0 for @entity1 a swan dubbed ' @entity3 ' has become the latest in his family to terrorise punters and kayakers as they try to enjoy a relaxing jaunt on an idyllic @entity9 river			1
the feathered fiend , who is the son of ' mr @entity12 ' , is now causing his own havoc on the @entity14 after his father was removed in 2012 after becoming too violent			1
' @entity3 ' , who rules the roost by swimming up and down pecking at punters and flying into families on the waterway , has already attacked a canoeist and swimmer			2
at their last meeting the river authorities , the @entity34 , revealed how the bad - tempered bird attacks any boat which gets too close , including canoes and rowing boats			1
' he 's the most vicious swan i have ever seen			1
when i was punting with my family he stuck his neck in the boat and hissed and pecked at us , ' said @entity48 , 45 , from @entity9			0
' i even saw him trying to bite through the chains which tether the punts to the wall of the river			0
' resident @entity53 , 67 , who lives near the river , said many believed ' @entity3 ' was now worse than his predecessor			2
' he swims up and down the river as if he is patrolling it and flaps his wings and hisses at anything which gets in his way , ' she said			2
' @entity3 ' has been described as ' the most vicious swan ever ' by locals who fear he may soon seriously injure one resident said ' @entity3 ' was now worse than his vicious father who had to be moved 60 miles away punt operators believe some tourists are flocking to @entity9 just to see ' @entity3 ' and take photos of him ' we thought things would settle down when they removed mr @entity12 , but his son is much worse			1
there have been some near misses and i do n't think it will be long before someone is really injured			0
' one punt operator said : ' @entity3 seems to have become a bit of a tourist attraction and people are even more interested in taking photos of him than @entity80			0
' the @entity81 moved ' @entity3 's ' father ' mr @entity12 ' to a secret location about 60 miles away in 2012 because they said his behaviour was risking the safety of river users as well as himself			1
his behaviour left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises and a special marshal even had to be employed during a university rowing race to prevent him from injuring the students			0
one resident said : ' we thought things would settle down when they removed mr @entity12 , but his son is worse ' the bird is said to patrol the waterway and peck , hiss and flap its wing at anyone who gets too close to him the swan has even been spotted trying to break through the chains which line the idyllic @entity14 @entity48 , 45 , from @entity9 , described ' @entity3 ' as ' the most vicious swan i have ever seen ' ever since , ' @entity3 ' has taken over as chief of the waterway and has spent the last 18 months trying to scare visitors away			1
he has n't just taken a disliking to humans though - he has also been spotted attacking one his own , as well as confronting a huge bull			0
last year , horrified tourists watched on as ' @entity3 ' ferociously grabbed a passing swan by the neck with his beak , held it under the water for 15 seconds and then sat on it to stop it wriggling free			2
the hapless victim only escaped the attack when its partner came to the rescue			0
the river authorities , the @entity34 , confirmed the bird had already attacked a swimmer and canoeist the ' vicious ' swan patrols the @entity14 , pecking at people , punters and rowers as they glide along the river a large bull has been the only creature to stand up the swan so far , and scared it back down into the river visitors watched in horror as ' @entity3 ' turned on one of his own and grabbed a fellow swan by the neck ' @entity3 ' is following in the footsteps of his father ' mr @entity12 ' ( pictured ) who regularly attacked on the @entity14 however , ' @entity3 ' met his match when he left his safe haven of the water and tried to scare off a huge bullock			1
the huge animal was simply grazing on the riverbank when the swan approached and prepared to launch an attack			0
however , the bullock was having none of it and , unperturbed , simply advanced towards ' @entity3 ' and put him back in his place by forcing him back down into the river .			0

' vicious ' swan nicknamed ' @entity3 ' has been terrorising punters on @entity14
bird is son of ' mr @entity12 ' - violent swan which was removed from river in 2012
' @entity3 ' pecks , hisses and flaps its wings at any boat which gets close to it
