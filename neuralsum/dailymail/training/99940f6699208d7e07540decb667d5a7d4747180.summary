the backlash continues against @entity3 chairman @entity2 ’s proposal to allow b - teams from big clubs into the lower reaches of the football pyramid			1
@entity8 , chief executive of @entity9 , claims @entity2 ’s idea , revealed on thursday , will wreck the @entity11			1
he also reminded the @entity3 of their duty of care to football at all levels , not only the elite at @entity18 and in the @entity19			1
scroll down to read the full statement from the @entity22 board controversial : @entity24 's b - team proposal has been criticised from all angles ' the idea of a b - team league is abysmal , ' said @entity8			1
' i do n’t think it could ever work and while we have to be cautious i do n’t think that ’s really the issue			0
i think this is an idea floated out there when the underlying objective is to create feeder clubs , either directly by takeover of another club of by an extension of the loan system and the significant partnerships			0
' for me , it would wreck the @entity11			1
this is a problem the @entity19 has			1
they do n’t want to take the risk of blooding youngsters in a league where the cost of failure is enormous and their solution is to reorganise the @entity11 for their own benefit			2
' it is unfortunate that it is the @entity3 which has put this forward because the @entity3 has a job to nourish and protect all of football across @entity18 and this comprehensively fails to do that			2
in fact it will damage it			0
' @entity9 was a club created amid blundering @entity3 directives of the past , when @entity9 were allowed to leave south - west @entity63 and move to @entity64 , where they became @entity66			1
fourth tier : @entity9 finished mid-table in @entity68 this season @entity9 was founded in 2002 to replace the lost team			0
they started in the ninth tier of @entity18 football and are now in @entity68			0
' football clubs are rooted in their own communities , ' said @entity8			2
' people support them and they grow up around them , more so for ours than most but for more or less all clubs			0
and we can become @entity19 team @entity80 ’s the concern for football fans and the links to the communities ? where ’s the respect for a football pyramid that ’s hugely successful ? ' any shift towards feeder clubs threatens to eat away at the independence of many smaller clubs and the angry reaction should come as no surprise to @entity2			1
' @entity2 held a meeting with @entity95 and two clubs at @entity97 earlier this year to discuss this sort of thing and he was left in no doubt how we felt about it , ' said @entity8			1
' it is important for us all that we have a successful @entity18 team but the solution is in the hands of the @entity19			2
' wrecking ball : @entity8 believes that @entity2 's proposal will damage the @entity11 as the elected representatives of the custodians and owners of @entity9 's @entity113 , the @entity22 board were dismayed to read the report of @entity3 chairman @entity2 's @entity115			1
these plans appear to be seriously entertaining the idea of parachuting a new tier of league football into the existing pyramid – including b teams of @entity19 clubs that consider themselves overburdened with young players who are n't playing enough games			1
we suspect that no clubs ' fans have seen their team play at as many levels of the game in as short a time as @entity9 fans			0
from leaving the @entity19 at the @entity132 in june 2000 to re-joining the @entity11 in 2011 via the @entity133 , the @entity134 and the @entity135 , @entity9 have played in every tier from first to ninth of the league pyramid except @entity95 in this century			1
one of the reasons that @entity9 fans received so much solidarity from fans of other clubs when our league place was awarded to @entity64 by a three - man commission in 2002 was because it so crudely compromised the integrity of the league pyramid structure			0
until 2002 no town or club had been awarded a league place off the pitch , every promotion had been won on the merits of what a club 's players achieved			2
throughout our journey to reclaim our league place , @entity22 board members met supporters , chairmen , committee men and women and owners at over a hundred non-league clubs			0
despite the controversial circumstances of our rebirth , we and other @entity9 supporters very much enjoyed this journey			0
we met many amazing people who have dedicated much of their lives to sustaining football clubs in their communities			0
in 2002 the @entity174 that awarded @entity176 's league place to @entity64 actually told @entity9 fans not to bother restarting , telling us it would not be " in the wider interests of football			1
" we proved them wrong many times over			0
but this proposal to abolish the very founding tenets of the @entity18 league structure on a vague promise it might improve the fortunes of the national team is most certainly not in the wider interests of football			2
it lazily cherry picks elements from other countries ' systems that just so happen to serve the narrow interests of an elite group of largely @entity19 clubs			2
the @entity3 has a responsibility to represent and protect its members at all levels of the game			2
this proposal has been dreamed up without any serious engagement with supporters or even with the @entity135			0
our representative organisations - @entity202 and the @entity203 - were not spoken to or invited to discuss the issues with the commission			0
this arrogant approach has rightly angered many thousands of football supporters			0
this proposal as it currently stands is an insult to each and every single club below @entity213 level and to the hundreds of thousands of fans around the country who watch their local teams across the season			1
the @entity3 abdicated its responsibilities in 2002 when it sanctioned the franchising of a single club to @entity64			1
if it pushes ahead with this proposal it will have abdicated its responsibilities to all its members , bar the largest @entity19 clubs			1
the b team proposal is entirely without merit			0
while we have concerns about other parts of the report – the @entity230 look to us like feeder clubs by the back door – we believe that the b team proposal brings the entire report into disrepute			2
we will be happy to engage in a genuine consultation once the report has been withdrawn .			0

@entity3 chairman @entity2 has proposed to introduce @entity19 ' b - teams ' into the @entity11
proposal part of @entity174 report on the state of the national @entity243 become the *latest* club to criticise @entity2 's proposal
chief exec @entity8 says b - teams would ' wreck ' @entity11
