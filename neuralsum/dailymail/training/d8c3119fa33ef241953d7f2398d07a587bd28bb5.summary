when the @entity2 decided to make a career - spanning documentary , their music was only ever going to be one part of the warts ’ n ’ all story			1

they sold 120 million albums and provided the soundtrack for a generation of baby boomers with hits like @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
but @entity19 , out now on dvd , does n’t neglect the extra-curricular side of an outfit who lived up to the title of their 1976 song @entity27			1
as singer and drummer @entity28 admits , ‘ drugs , girls and fights ’ loomed large			1
take the infamous concert in @entity34 , @entity35 , in 1980 , when tensions between guitarists @entity37 and @entity39 came to an ugly head			1

‘ drugs , girls and fights ’ loomed large during the band 's heyday the @entity2 redefined @entity9 rock after forming in @entity10 in 1972			1
they sold 120 million albums and provided the soundtrack for a generation of baby boomers with hits like @entity16 and @entity18 in @entity56 to promote their dvd , made with @entity58 - winning producer @entity57 , the current @entity2 line - up from left to right - @entity28 , @entity39 , guitarist @entity43 and bassist @entity60 - present a united face @entity37 felt he should be given more opportunity to sing lead vocals			1
@entity39 , and the rest of the band , disagreed			1
before the show , @entity39 broke a beer bottle against the dressing room wall			1
afterwards , @entity37 smashed his guitar before storming off into the night			2
the concert - a benefit gig , no less - was played out amid muttered onstage threats ( all captured on the dvd )			2
at one point , @entity39 is caught whispering he is going to kill @entity37 after ‘ three more songs , ass * * * * ! ’			2
the @entity2 did n’t play together for another 14 years , @entity28 famously commenting that they would only reunite ‘ when hell freezes over ’			1
no prizes for guessing what they called their 1994 comeback tour			2
in @entity56 to promote the film , made with @entity58 - winning producer @entity57 , the current @entity2 line - up — @entity28 , @entity39 , guitarist @entity43 and bassist @entity60 — present a united face			1
‘ we were never really at each other ’s throats , ’ insists @entity39 , 64 , rather unconvincingly			2
‘ we specialised in a quiet turbulence			2
that @entity34 concert was unfortunate			2
we fought because we were passionate about the band			2
’ ‘ men grow up slowly , especially in the music business , ’ adds @entity28 , 65			2
‘ we started this band in our 20s , but we were kids , really			2
we ’ve learned how to tolerate one another now			2
our differences are not as dramatic			0
’ the film ’s best footage is its early archive material , telling the tale of how @entity99 - born @entity39 ( pronounced ‘ @entity100 ’ ) and the @entity101 met in @entity10			1
they toured as @entity104 ’s backing band before launching the @entity2 with guitarist @entity105 and bassist @entity44			1
‘ we lived for the moment , ’ @entity28 tells me			0
‘ our label , @entity109 , booked us into a club in @entity111 , @entity112 , because we needed to play to people			0
it was a wooden shed , but we had some wild times there			0
it was a hippy town , and everybody was on drugs			0
‘ we were never really at each other ’s throats , ’ insists @entity39 , 64			0
‘ we specialised in a quiet turbulence			0
' the @entity2 sit on chairs as the perform on the television show ' @entity125 's @entity124 , ' 1979 ‘ we tempered our bad habits , though			1
we never let bingeing get in the way of work			0
i ’d drink and take drugs all weekend , but i ’d go to the gym on monday morning to clean it all out			0
we had a survival instinct — every current and former member of the @entity2 is still alive			1
’ mixing country rock , catchy pop and finely wrought harmonies , the @entity2 secured an unexpected hit with their self - titled debut album , but fared poorly , initially at least , with its follow - up , @entity142 , dismissed as ‘ a cowboy record ’ on account of its @entity146 - style sleeve			1
‘ we did n’t want to be pigeonholed , so there was a lot of variation on the early albums , ’ says @entity28			0
‘ we played bluegrass , country , rock , blues and soul			1
it was an organic way of developing as we searched for a direction			0
’ if @entity43 ’s 1976 arrival gave the @entity2 a keener rock ’ n ’ roll edge , the wild - card guitarist ’s unpredictable streak brought new problems			1
with friend @entity164 , @entity163 became known as the king of the hotel room - trash			0
soon , the band were barred from all the best establishments			0
now 65 , a clean and sober @entity163 admits his antics were fuelled by his insecurity around @entity39 and @entity28 — superior talents in his eyes — although things took a darker turn after the band ’s 1980 split			0
‘ when we stopped , i was sad and did n’t know what to do , ’ he says			0
‘ so i kept going			0
i became an alcoholic and dependent on drugs			0
i hit rock - bottom			1
’ it took the band ’s 1994 reunion to convince @entity163 that there was an alternative to oblivion			0
@entity187 , also 65 , explains : ‘ he looked so bad			0
i think the offer to rejoin the band saved him			0
’ since then , the @entity2 have soared , and inspired by the documentary ( to be shown on @entity192 in june ) , they are gearing up for a two - year world tour			1
‘ as a band , we had so many issues i ’m surprised we ever wrote any songs , ’ says @entity28			0
‘ but , somehow , we got it done			0
’ @entity19 is out on dvd and blu - ray			0
@entity19 , out now on @entity198 , does n’t neglect the extra-curricular side of an outfit who lived up to the title of their 1976 song @entity27			0
