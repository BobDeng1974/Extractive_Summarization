ms @entity40 told the court @entity13 and her mother ' engaged really well '			2
' in comparison to other cases , when you read it , there were some things that @entity52 did well and there were other times that she did n't ... it would be a case that was not as significant as other cases , ' she said			0
' it was n't what we 'd look at in middle class society and say ' it was okay ' but in child protection ... it appeared to myself to be okay			0
' other claims were previously made in court by three people - including @entity68 who was the child 's respite carer - who said @entity70 left sex toys and drugs around the house , called her daughter a ' c * * * ' and also fed @entity75 's and spent her welfare money on herself			1

family members , including @entity70 's father , raised alarms about infant @entity13 's safety and told agencies they would be happy to take care of the girl if she was removed from her mother			2
