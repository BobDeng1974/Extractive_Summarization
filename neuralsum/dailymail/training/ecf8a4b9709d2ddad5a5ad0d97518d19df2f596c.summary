@entity1 health supremo @entity0 has clashed with @entity2 over a plan for ‘ drunk tanks ’ in @entity5 and emergency units which would give priority to sober people with injuries			1
@entity0 wants to pledge that a crackdown on drunks in @entity13 departments will be introduced if @entity1 wins next year ’s election			1
but the @entity1 leader has refused to let him announce the move for fear it could backfire			1
last year , more than a million people were admitted to hospital for alcohol - related illnesses or injuries – double the number in 2002/3 the friction between them comes amid growing reports that @entity27 is favourite to succeed the embattled opposition leader			1
allies of @entity2 have accused @entity27 , 44 , of running a covert campaign to promote his leadership credentials , including meetings with key @entity1 activists and union leaders who will have a big say in who succeeds @entity2			2
health chiefs say waiting times for treatment in @entity13 units have been exacerbated by the growing number of drunk people who turn up demanding help			1
at present , hospitals treat all @entity13 patients equally , regardless of whether they are drunk or sober			0
it means elderly patients , children and others who need urgent care are forced to wait while a person whose injury is caused by their own drunkenness is treated first			0

the call comes amid mounting concern over the rising cost of treating people under the influence			0
