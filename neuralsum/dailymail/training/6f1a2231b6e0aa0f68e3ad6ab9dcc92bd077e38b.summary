parts of @entity1 are to be treated to a rare display of the @entity3 on friday evening			1
the colourful bands of shimmering light are usually only seen in the northerly reaches of @entity7 , @entity8 and remote parts of @entity10			1
but tonight the display , known as the aurora borealis , is forecast to be on show in northern @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
known as coronal mass ejections , they can produce many colours , with green , pink , red , blue and yellow all possible			0
the combined effect of two explosions increases the chance of a display			2
as they whip towards the @entity29 , the particles crash into other particles , accelerating and energising them			0
and when they enter our atmosphere they collide with oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the air , which when charged , create the shimmering light that we know as the @entity3			1
often the particles are deflected by the earth ’s magnetic field , so the best places to witness it are close to the poles where the field is weakest			0
normally , the earth ’s magnetic field funnels the high - energy particles – and so the display - towards the @entity61			2
the display , known as the aurora borealis , is forecast to be on show in northern @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 ( file picture ) but just occasionally , the sun ’s emissions are so violent and so on target , that most of @entity1 , as far south as @entity69 , gets a ringside seat			1
different colours are created depending on the energy of the incoming particles – and the type of atom they hit in the atmosphere			0
for instance , a red glow , which usually occurs high in the sky , is created by lower energy particles interacting with oxygen			2
@entity83 lights are caused by slightly more energetic particles , while a purple hue involves nitrogen			0
a spokesman for the @entity88 said : ‘ to view the @entity3 you are best finding a dark place away from street lights			1
‘ you will need a cloud - free sky and although there will be some cloud and localised fog patches around this friday night there should also be some clear skies too			2
‘ so there is a chance of catching a glimpse of the lights			0
your best chance of sighting the aurora will be around midnight			0
