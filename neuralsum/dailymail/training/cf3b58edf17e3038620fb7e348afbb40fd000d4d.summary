controversial @entity1 footballer @entity0 is taking his time writing an autobiography sure to cause the same kind of stir as the @entity7 and @entity8 books this week			1
@entity0 has spent more than two years on the project — rejecting the manuscripts of two ghost writers and then parting company with publishers @entity13 , who wanted to rush out the book for this year ’s christmas market before @entity0 was ready			1
the midfielder , whose desire to gain a wider sporting perspective saw him at the leaders in @entity22 conference on wednesday so he could listen to cycling innovator sir @entity23 , is now writing the life story himself			2
@entity0 has spent more than two years on his autobiography , rejecting manuscripts from two ghosts @entity0 is talking to other publishers after the fall - out with @entity13 but is also examining digital self - publishing and releasing the contents chapter by chapter			1
@entity0 ’s first ghost was @entity36 sports writer @entity35 but it was felt he had portrayed his views of @entity0 rather than those of the footballer			1
@entity13 then put forward author @entity41 but his effort read more like a fictional novel to the former @entity45 player			2
now , with the guidance of the head of humanities at @entity50 , where @entity0 is studying for a degree in philosophy , the firebrand has completed nine chapters			1
the delay has allowed @entity0 to include his spell at @entity56 plus @entity1 ’s return to the top flight and his appearance on @entity60			1
@entity0 wants to create a stir with his book like @entity7 and @entity8 have done this week such are the problems at troubled @entity64 under owner @entity65 that the @entity67 players and the large @entity69 contingent sit at separate tables for pre-match meals			1
the first half of @entity76 chairman @entity75 ’s @entity74 report was derailed by the @entity77 vetoing their chairman @entity78 being on the panel			1
but the second edition , to be announced tomorrow , has been notable for the warring bodies working closely for a change			0
@entity77 chief @entity83 even travelled to @entity84 to spend three hours addressing the @entity74			0
the big focus in part two is improving grass - roots facilities and coaching — to be piloted in @entity89			0
it is due to be funded by the @entity76 , the @entity77 and the government			2
@entity92 are following @entity93 and @entity94 by opening a commercial office in @entity96			0
but while @entity93 are based in plush @entity97 , @entity92 have chosen , like @entity94 , to have their satellite operation near @entity100 railway station			0
this shortens the commute from the @entity103			0
@entity105 ' pirates ' snubbed @entity106 has welcomed @entity105 ’s plan to play pre-season tournaments outside @entity109 @entity105 ’s plan to play pre-season tournaments outside @entity109 , revealed by @entity111 , has been welcomed by @entity106 , the president of the @entity113 federation that governs the favoured host countries in @entity115			0
but @entity116 , the @entity117 owner who took @entity118 to the @entity119 , is not in favour , claiming @entity109 clubs want to ‘ take money out of that landscape ’			0
@entity116 ’s brother @entity124 , ceo of @entity125 , also questioned whether it was a ‘ pirate move ’ by @entity105 at @entity127 in @entity22			0
meanwhile , @entity106 ’s admirable stance on the racism scandal of @entity131 ’s black youth coach @entity130 not getting near any managerial openings would have more credence if the @entity136 anti-discrimination task force @entity106 heads had met in the last calendar year			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
it makes sense for @entity74 to play home matches around the country when @entity142 will only be half full for the visit of @entity144 on thursday			1
but that will have to wait until the @entity76 negotiate a more flexible contract with @entity142 from 2017			1
the @entity76 are prioritising a full @entity148 franchise at @entity142 , which could see @entity74 games played elsewhere			1
however , @entity150 taking precedence over association football seems bizarre			0
@entity94 , whose women play @entity155 in the @entity76 ’s @entity157 final at @entity158 a week today , are angry the game is being staged so close to @entity96 and aggravated by the @entity76 not responding to their complaints			2
the @entity76 say the venue was chosen months ago .			2

@entity0 has spent more than two years on his book
book is expected to cause the same stir as @entity7 and @entity8 *'s*
@entity69 and @entity67 players at @entity64 sit separately during pre-match meals
the @entity76 are prioritising a full @entity148 franchise at @entity142
