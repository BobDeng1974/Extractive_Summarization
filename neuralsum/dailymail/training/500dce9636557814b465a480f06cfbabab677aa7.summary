by @entity0 hallelujah ! another @entity3 biography ! a remarkable number of books have been written about the old groaner , once lovingly known to @entity8 music critics as ‘ @entity9 ’			1
but there are two good reasons for this			2
one is the lyrics : opaque , complex , redemptive , capable of endless interpretation and reinterpretation			1
the other is the wonderful shape of his late - flowering career			1
hats off to @entity9 : musician @entity3 is loved for his ability to talk off the cuff inducted into the @entity25 @entity24 in 1991 , he said : ‘ if i had been given this attention when i was 26 , it would have turned my head			1
at 36 it might have confirmed my flight on a rather morbid spiritual path			2
at 46 it would have rubbed my nose in my failing powers and have prompted a plotting of a getaway and an alibi			2
but at 56 — hell , i ’m just hitting my stride and it does n’t hurt at all			2
’ a third reason might be this : who could n’t love a man who can talk like that off the cuff ? @entity3 ( pictured ) will be 80 in september and has never been more popular			1
his recent live performances , which only began because his former manager had hopped off with all his money , have been a revelation and a delight			2
and @entity48 , a song from an album his record company originally turned down , has become one of the most covered songs of the past decade , although as @entity56 points out , most of the singers who attempt it misinterpret it			1
‘ the song tends to inspire the sort of cascade of crescendos that causes inexperienced and dramatic singers to shut their eyes tightly and clench their fists as they belt out verse after verse			2
overcome by emotion , they take the song to be about the hallelujah of the orgasm			0
’ @entity3 , says @entity56 , has none of that			1
he always sings it simply ( as he sings everything ) because the words are what count , not the performance			0
when an interviewer told him that @entity48 conveyed a sense of holiness , @entity3 wanted to talk about ritual instead			1
‘ i understand that they forgot how to build the arch for several hundred years , ’ he said			0
‘ masons forgot how to build certain kinds of arches , it was lost			0
so it is in our time that certain spiritual mechanisms that were very useful have been abandoned and forgot			0
redemption , repentance , resurrection			0
‘ all those ideas are thrown out with the bathwater			0
people become suspicious of religion plus all these redemptive mechanisms that are very useful			0
’ one wonders what @entity100 , who won @entity101 with an atrocious , grandstanding version of the song , would make of that			0
not a lot , i would imagine			0
flawed hero : @entity3 is best known for his song ' @entity48 ' which has become one of the most covered songs of the decade @entity56 is a youngish @entity112 academic , and his book is rather more intellectually rigorous than most rock biographies			1
@entity3 ’s love life is famously ragged , but @entity56 is n’t interested in gossip			1
what he ’s after are the philosophical and theological bases of @entity3 ’s art. he is fascinated by the young man ’s struggle , for @entity123 was in his mid- 30s before he even recorded a note			1
@entity25 , @entity125 and not very tall , he never ceased to feel like an outsider			0
whatever was going on in popular culture never seemed to have much to do with him			0
in the late 1960s , for instance , psychedelia was mutating into blues rock , and thence into progressive and glam rock			1
only @entity3 was sitting alone with his guitar , singing long , slow , highly literary laments to lost love and the meaningless horror of modern existence			1
he emerges from the book as something of a hero , flawed as we all are , complex as very few of us are , and not just looking for answers but actually finding some			0
he ’s laughing @entity144 now , for real .			0

@entity3 *'s* lyrics are capable of endless interpretation
his late - flowering career has a wonderful shape
@entity48 has become one of the most covered songs of the past decade
