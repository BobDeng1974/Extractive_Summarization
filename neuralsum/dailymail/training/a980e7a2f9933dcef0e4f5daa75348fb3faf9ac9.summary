one woman in a fading @entity2 village is slowly replacing its dead residents with scarecrows			1
the 35 residents left in @entity7 , southern @entity2 , are now outnumbered three - two - one by the mannequins @entity9 has made to replace neighbours who have died or moved away			1
it 's an eccentric response to an increasingly common problem			0
more than 10,000 towns and villages in @entity2 are depopulated , homes and infrastructure crumbling as the countryside empties			1
' they bring back memories ' : @entity9 stitches a scarecrow girl by her outdoor hearth at her home in @entity7 , southern @entity2 , which is one of 10,000 radically depopulated as the country 's population decreases scarecrow passengers wait at a bus stop : this village deep in the rugged mountains of southern @entity2 once was home to hundreds of families			1
now , only 35 people remain , outnumbered three - to - one by scarecrows a teenager scarecrow sits on a log pile : @entity7 is typical of the thousands of rural @entity2 communities turning into ghost towns or at best , open - air museums , frozen in time at 65 , ms @entity9 is one of the younger residents of @entity7 , a small village nestled in the rugged mountain landscape of interior of the southern island of @entity44			1
she moved back from @entity45 to look after her 85 - year - old father after decades away			0
' they bring back memories , ' ms @entity9 said of the life - size dolls crowded into corners of her farmhouse , perched on fences and trees , huddled side - by - side at a produce stall , the bus stop - anywhere a living person might stop			1
' that old lady used to come and chat and drink tea			0
that old man used to love to drink sake and tell stories			0
it reminds me of the old times , when they were still alive and well , ' she said			0
returnee : ms @entity9 returned to @entity7 13 years ago to look after her elderly father after decades away creepy : a mannequin watches ms @entity9 as she stitches together a new ' resident ' model students : a scarecrow teacher and pupils fill a classroom in @entity7 's now deserted elementary school @entity7 is typical of the thousands of communities turning into ghost towns or at best , open - air museums , frozen in time - a trend evident even in downtown @entity82 and in nearly or completely empty villages in the city 's suburbs			1
the one - street town is mostly abandoned , its shops and homes permanently shuttered			2
with no youngsters left to raise , the local elementary school closed two years ago			2
now ms @entity9 sometimes guides visitors through the spotless classrooms populated with scarecrow students and teachers			2
as @entity2 grew increasingly affluent after the @entity95 , younger @entity2 abandoned the countryside , flooding into the cities for jobs in factories and service industries , leaving their elders to tend small farms			1
@entity82 , with more than 37million people , and @entity104 , with 11.5million , account for nearly 40 per cent of the country 's 127million people , with another 10million scattered in a handful of provincial capitals			0
' there 's been this huge sucking sound as the countryside is emptied , ' said @entity112 , a professor at @entity114 's @entity113			0
meanwhile , a falling birthrate means there are too few people to repopulate rural areas as the rapidly ageing population left tending the fields die off			1
@entity2 's population began to decline in 2010 from a peak of 128 million			1
without a drastic increase in the birthrate or a loosening of the staunch @entity2 resistance to immigration , it is forecast to fall to about 108 million by 2050 and to 87 million by 2060			2
by then , four in 10 @entity2 will be over 65 years old			2
with no feet to fell them : a pair of slippers sits ready to be worn outside an abandoned home in @entity134 , a town close to @entity7 that is also all but deserted gathering dust : an electric rice cooker is seen through a window of an abandoned home in @entity134 when ms @entity9 returned to her hometown 13 years ago , she initially tried farming			1
thinking her radish seeds may have been eaten by crows , she decided to make some scarecrows			0
now there are more 100 scattered around @entity7 and other towns in @entity44			2
like handcarved @entity150 sculptures , each has its own whimsical expression			0
some sleep , their eyelids permanently shut			0
others cuddle toddler scarecrows , or man ploughs and hoes			0
ms @entity9 brings one along for company on her 90 - minute drive to buy groceries in the nearest big town			1
but most remain behind , to be photographed and marvelled at by tourists who detour through the winding mountain roads			0
' if i had n't made these scarecrows , people would just drive right by , ' she said .			0

@entity9 made the mannequins to replace neighbours in her town
she lives in @entity7 , a village left all but abandoned by population decline
it is typical of thousands of rural communities across @entity2
