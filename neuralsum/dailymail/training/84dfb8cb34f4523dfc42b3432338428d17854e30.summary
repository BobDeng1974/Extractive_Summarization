by @entity0 published : 10:07 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 10:27 est , 12 april 2013 it is the book that could finally shed light on one of the world ’s most keenly followed murder investigations			1
but @entity7 ’s memoir will not appear on @entity9 bookshelves , amid fears of legal action			1
@entity12 served four years in an @entity14 jail for the 2007 murder of her @entity9 flatmate @entity18 in @entity19			1
' @entity20 ' : @entity7 , seen weeping in court in @entity19 after her conviction was overturned in 2011 , has written a book about her experiences following the murder of her former flatmate @entity18 she and former boyfriend @entity27 were freed on appeal in 2011 , but last month @entity14 ’s highest court dramatically ruled the pair must face retrial			1
@entity12 , for now a free woman and living back in her hometown of @entity34 , was due to release her memoir , waiting to be heard , on april 30			2
she had been paid a reported $ 4million advance			0
axed : the news that @entity7 will face a retrial over the murder of @entity18 ( left ) has led to @entity40 to cancel the @entity9 publication of her memoir ( right ) in the @entity9 on the advice of lawyers but @entity9 publishers @entity40 said after taking legal advice , the book will not be published here in the @entity9 - although it will still be published in the @entity47 it is understood the memoir could attract legal action under the @entity9 ’s strict libel laws			1
@entity12 has already been convicted of defaming her former boss , bar owner @entity18 , whom she accused of killing @entity18			2
in a similar case , in january this year , the publication of a @entity56 expose was cancelled in the @entity9			0
publishers @entity58 said , after taking legal advice , that the book was ‘ not robust enough for the @entity9 market			2
’ last month the lawyer who set up @entity12 's multi-million dollar publishing deal hinted that the memoir contained major revelations , as he insisted publication would go ahead despite the re-trial ordered by @entity14 's highest court			2
@entity70 said in an interview that certain aspects of the book would ' shock you to the core			0
' the 25 - year - old 's first television interview , with @entity78 anchor @entity77 , is also due to be broadcast on april 30			0
@entity12 is said to have collapsed when she learned that she would face a retrial over the murder of ms @entity82 in a 2am phone call from her lawyer last month			1
she will not voluntarily return to @entity14 to face trial , and is unlikely to be extradited by the @entity47 as such she is expected to be tried in absentia			2
re-trial : @entity7 ( left ) and her @entity14 former boyfriend @entity88 ( right ) were both freed on appeal in 2011 after spending four years behind bars for the 2007 murder of the @entity93 student judges in @entity96 's supreme court accepted there were ' contradictions ' in the case , quashing the acquittals of @entity12 and her ex-boyfriend @entity88 , 29			2
the pair , both of whom spent four years behind bars in @entity14 before they were freed , were informed they must stand trial again for the murder of the 21 - year - old student			0
ms @entity82 , from @entity108 , @entity109 , was in @entity14 as an exchange student from @entity93			0
she was found dead in 2007 , in the cottage she shared with @entity12 in the picturesque hilltop town of @entity19			0
her throat had been slit and her semi-naked body had been covered with a duvet			0
after a lengthy trial in @entity19 , @entity12 and @entity27 were convicted of the murder in december 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively , but two years later the pair were freed after an appeal court found that the case had been botched and dna evidence contaminated			0
a third suspect , @entity18 , whose dna and bloody footprints were found all over the crime scene , is serving a 16 - year prison sentence , reduced from 30 years on appeal			0
the fact that @entity7 's memoir will hit the shelves in the @entity47 as planned despite being pulled in the @entity9 in light of her retrial is evidence of the vast divide between libel laws on either side of the pond			1
the stringent nature of @entity9 libel laws has led activists to campaign for changes to legislation they claim has a negative impact on freedom of expression			1
lawyers , publishers , bloggers , journalists and scientists are among those to point to the ' chilling effect ' of current @entity9 libel laws on legitimate publication , highlighting instances of ' libel tourism ' - which sees wealthy individuals or corporations from overseas using the @entity9 courts to silence their critics			1
critics argue that existing @entity162 libel laws favour claimants - with the onus on the defendant to prove that they are innocent - and that the high cost of defending a libel action forces defendants to settle out of court even when they believe what they published was true			1
in the @entity47 , in contrast , the freedom of speech and freedom of the press is protected by the @entity174 .			0

waiting to be @entity176 wo *n't* appear on @entity9 bookshelves , says @entity40
follows news that @entity12 will face retrial over the murder of @entity18
it is thought the memoir could fall foul of the @entity9 's strict libel laws
book , for which @entity12 received a $ 4m advance , will still be published in @entity47
