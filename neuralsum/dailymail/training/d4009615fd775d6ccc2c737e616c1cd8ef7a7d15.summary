by @entity0 published : 17:11 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 18:28 est , 16 october 2013 at this time of year , usually between the crisp and lush pages of a new autobiography , celebrities do battle to out - confess each other with ever more lurid personal disclosures			1
why ? for a start , the @entity8 market is coming up fast and competition to get on the best - seller lists is intense			1
one of the most dependable ways to ensure that your life story stands out on the shelves is to lard it with a revelation or two that will both shock your fans while also neatly encouraging their sympathy			0
queasy : any sex attack is vile , but one has to wonder about @entity25 's motive in hinting at the identity of her attacker my binge @entity29			1
you know the sort of thing			0
and strangely enough , these headline - grabbing divulgences , these marmalade - droppers du jour , always tend to follow a trend			1
they track unfathomable tectonic shifts deep below the crust of the celebrity world , which somehow finds them all suffering from the same thing at the same time			0
the recent fad for ' i was bullied ' confessions follows on from the bipolar confessions of yesteryear			0
those were a departure from the bulimia and assorted eating disorder confessions that were once all the rage ; a progression from previously popular alcohol , drug or sex addiction confessions			1
and now the new black - certainly the new black market - is for shocking sex - attack revelations			1
over recent weeks and months , we have learnt the following : that @entity25 was sexually attacked by a ' famous comedian ' at a glitzy function when she was still married to @entity63 ; that a 20 - year - old @entity64 was raped at knifepoint on the roof of a @entity68 building			1
that @entity69 was drugged and date raped by someone she considered a friend when she was a teenager			0
that @entity72 was gang - raped during a three - day ordeal in @entity74			1
that @entity75 has suffered multiple rapes and sexual assaults , including an attack by at least one celebrity rapist			0
similar revelations : recently , we 've learned that a 20 - year - old @entity64 was raped at knifepoint and that @entity69 was drugged and date raped when a teenager there are others too numerous to mention - not to forget @entity87 , whose 2002 autobiography @entity89 was one of the first to prominently and explosively feature such an attack			1
in her case , it was a sexual assault at the beginning of her career by a television presenter she did not identify			0
famously , media speculation led to former @entity103 presenter @entity102 being named as the alleged culprit - although @entity87 , to this day , has refused to confirm or deny it			1
following this revelation , several other women went to the police with accusations relating to indecent assault by @entity102			1
during the subsequent court case , all charges against him were dropped - and he was never charged with any offences against @entity87			1
despite this , @entity102 's name was blackened and his career in showbusiness effectively finished			2
@entity25 , in her new autobiography @entity120 , seems to have strayed into the same insidious , murky territory			1
yes , any sex attack is sickening and vile			1
yes , any decent person will feel sympathy for her			0
but one still has to wonder what her motive is in describing her attacker as a ' famous comedian ' and locating the assault at a much - photographed media event within a narrow timeframe in the summer of 2000			2
' now the new black - certainly the new black market - is for shocking sex - attack revelations			1
' hinting at his celebrity status only invites , as surely it was intended to do , prurient speculation as to his identity - some of which will undoubtedly fall on the shoulders of innocent men			2
meanwhile we can only assume the guilty party is free to carry on molesting other women unchecked			0
a more responsible course of action for miss @entity147 might have been to go to the police and name him - i 'm assuming that did not happen - or entirely refrain from dropping vague but still poisonous clues as to whom he might be			1
that does n't help anyone or anything - except of course her book sales			1
so forgive me for being cynical , understand that i do not minimise the distress and misery of female sex attack victims , appreciate that i view any sex attack against a woman as a matter of the utmost gravity			1
however , i do have misgivings about this gathering movement , this stormy front moving in from the west , for female celebrities to suddenly reveal sex attacks that happened to them many years ago ; attacks that were never reported to the police or officials			1
attacks that have been kept secret from friends , family and even husbands for a variety of deeply personal reasons			2
attacks that are now being lobbed into the public domain , with all the subtlety of a fizzing grenade			2
to what purpose ? well , that is the big question			0
what is the point of revealing such shocking molestations years , even decades , after the event , if the victims have no intention of making a complaint or seeking justice for these crimes ? grey area : @entity75 , queen of the confessional autobiography , let slip the name of her rapist but never reported her attacker to the police perhaps the celebrities feel such confessions help other women , especially those who have suffered similar assaults ? there is certainly some merit in that , although my worry is that they encourage the notion that the best course of action for a woman who falls victim to a sexual assault is - in the short - term , at least - to put up and shut up			1
keep it to yourself until you have a safe platform , a book to sell , then use the worst experience of your life as a kind of currency to endear yourself to the public			2
how is that supposed to help any woman who has been attacked ? if anything , it cheapens their suffering			2
out in the real world , there are ordinary women who have been dragged off the streets and viciously raped , who have suffered terrible indignities and worse at the hands of men			0
yet they have had the courage to go to the police , to endure the ordeal of a trial and to hopefully see the men who have wronged them put behind bars , where they can not harm any more women			2
and since it was launched a year ago , @entity251 has encouraged nearly 600 alleged victims , for better or worse , to make complaints of sexual misconduct , against @entity255 and others			0
' what is the point of revealing such shocking molestations years , even decades , after the event , if the victims have no intention of making a complaint or seeking justice for these crimes ? ' i ca n't help but wonder what all those women - and men - who have come forward feel about the bleats made by our celebrity authors behind the safe and glossy barricade of their hardback books			1
it is one thing to walk into a police station and name a suspect			2
it is quite another to merely make a toot on the publicity trumpet , throw it out there , get it off your chest and hope for the best			0
that is not to say that reasons these women have for finally going public with their ordeals are entirely worthless			0
the motivations for doing so are often difficult and complicated			0
and they are different in every case			0
@entity25 kept her attack secret even from her then husband @entity63 - why ? because she was afraid he would make a scene			1
the incident happened when she was trying to reconcile with @entity63 following her brief affair with men behaving badly star @entity300			0
this had ended , with much public opprobrium , a few weeks earlier			0
@entity147 writes in no holding back : ' during our first tentative weeks at trying again , we went to an event together and on my way back from the loo i was cornered by a famous comedian , who tried to kiss me and put his hands in places they should n't have been			0
' i was scared and tried to push him away , making light of it so he would leave without causing a fuss , but he was n't put off			0
' as i tried to fight him off , i caught sight of our reflection in a mirror			0
my body went limp , and i just stood there as he groped and nuzzled me , observing myself from afar			0
' no holding back : discussing her attack might boost book sales , but @entity25 's failure to report the incident suggests that violence against women is something to be endured now married to music producer @entity331 , the @entity334 's @entity333 judge said the attack left her feeling ' cheap and utterly worthless			1
' it would take a hard heart not to feel her pain			0
certainly many women , particularly those who wrongly blame themselves for their ordeals , will understand @entity147 's complex undertow of emotions and self - recrimination			1
four years ago @entity75 , the multi-volumed queen of the confessional autobiography , wrote in her magazine column about a celebrity who had raped her , leading to the usual speculations			2
she then let the alleged attacker 's name slip off - camera during the filming of her @entity355 reality show @entity356			1
what @entity75 did n't do next , at any time , was to report her attacker			2
she even refused to make a statement to police following her revelations			1
should she be blamed for that ? it is a grey area			0
many thousands of women have been sexually assaulted and never say a word about it			2
in many instances , they suspect they would not be believed			0
perhaps they blame themselves for allowing the bad situation to arise and feel they should have done more to control it			0
in many cases , women simply can not face the ordeal of being dragged through the courts - an entirely understandable reaction			2
yet despite this , for celebrities and non-celebrities alike , the experience can burn into their souls for years			1
perhaps there is comfort to be had in the knowledge for victims that other women , other famous women in particular , have suffered in the same way			0
however , the danger is that female stars divulging such attacks years after the event , sandwiched between cheery chapters on childbirth and meeting @entity399 , can actually do more harm that good			1
it might boost their book sales and enhance their noble suffering			2
but it does suggest that violence against women is something to be endured , to be shrugged off , to be kept a terrible secret and swept under the carpet - until it has a commercial value that can be cashed in .			0

in @entity25 's new book , we learn she was sexually attacked
such revelations are now common among many female celebrities
sex attacks are sickening and vile - they must be *condemned*
but why discuss such incidents years after the fact ? especially if you refuse to report attackers to the police !
