a quarter of a million extra school places are needed by next year , the @entity0 warns			1
the biggest baby boom since the 1950s combined with high levels of immigration have been blamed for the huge shortfall			1
the squeeze on household incomes has also seen large numbers of families turn their backs on private schooling			1
inadequate : there will be 250,000 fewer places than needed next year , some say down to immigration and the baby boom an estimated 240,000 of the places expected to be needed in the 2014 - 2015 academic year are in primaries			1
more children than ever could be forced to travel large distances to school , be taught in makeshift classrooms or in oversized classes			0
@entity25 , who is head of the @entity0 , said yesterday : ‘ despite increases in places and funding over the last two years , the @entity26 faces a real challenge , with 256,000 places still required by 2014 - 2015			1
‘ there are indications of real strain on school places			0
’ the number of pupils in state schools is expected to soar by nearly a million to 7,950,000 by the end of the decade			2
last year alone the primary school population went up by 78,000 , the fastest rise in a decade			2
sire @entity43 , from @entity46 @entity45 , believes that the problem has been caused by the policies of the last @entity50 government at least a fifth of schools were full or overflowing last may and the number of infant classes with more than 31 children has doubled since 2007			1
last september , hundreds of primary children were left waiting for a confirmed place as the term began			0
and around 23,000 began their education at schools their parents did n’t want them to attend			2
the rising demand has had a significant impact on the average time a child spends travelling to school			0
areas under the greatest strain include @entity69 , where 122 primary schools are educating children who are ‘ in excess of school capacity ’			2
@entity74 has 733 too many children in 114 primaries and 1,351 ‘ excess ’ pupils in 33 secondary schools			2
were migration reduced to zero , 106,000 fewer places would be needed , @entity26 figures suggest			0
but it is feared that the arrival of an estimated 50,000 @entity84 and @entity85 when an immigration cap expires at the end of this year will heighten the problem			1
councils have been concreting over parks and other open spaces to build extra classrooms			2
children are also having lessons in former warehouses , police stations , offices and retail outlets			0
some education chiefs have considered ‘ radical ’ solutions such as split - shift schooling , with school days staggered to have different year groups taught at different times of day			0
sir @entity43 , of @entity105 , said : ‘ this is yet another example of @entity50 ’s failure to plan for the inevitable effects of mass immigration which they stimulated			1
’ the @entity111 warned in november that a shortage of capacity for four - and five - year - olds is one of the biggest problems facing councils			2
failing : @entity50 claim that education secretary @entity118 is not performing the most basic tasks of his job the government has pumped more than £ 5billion into creating more spaces			1
but this did not include costs such as acquiring land – because the @entity26 assumed most places would be in existing schools , the @entity0 said			1
the shortage increases the likelihood of more ‘ super ’ primaries being opened that can accommodate up to 1,000 children			0
@entity134 , @entity50 ’s schools spokesman , accused the government of cutting funding for school buildings by 60 per cent			1
‘ @entity118 ’s first job as @entity118 is to provide enough school places for children – he is failing in that duty , ’ he added			0
but schools minister @entity142 said the @entity0 report confirmed the government was ‘ dramatically ’ increasing funding for school places			1
he added : ‘ @entity50 reduced the number of places available even though there was a baby boom			1
‘ we have already created 80,000 new places to deal with the shortage left by the last government and there will be more places to come			0
’ a @entity26 spokesman said : ‘ we will have spent around £ 5billion by 2015 on creating new school places , which is more than double the amount spent in the previous parliament			0
‘ we are confident that this will meet the local demand that local authorities face			0
’ @entity163 , of the @entity164 , said councils faced ‘ unprecedented pressures ’			0
‘ if the government wants to rapidly increase the number of school places it should release money from the grip of @entity174 mandarins and let councils , who have both the legal duty and the local knowledge to deliver new places			0

the @entity0 warns that there will be problems next year
the lack of spaces is partly *due* to immigration , and the baby boom
the squeeze on incomes has also led to an *exodus* from private schools
*critics* have blamed @entity50 *'s* immigration policies during the last government
