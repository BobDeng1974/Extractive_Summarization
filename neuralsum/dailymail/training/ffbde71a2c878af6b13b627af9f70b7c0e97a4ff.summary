by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:45 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 09:34 est , 12 november 2013 too many social workers view parents , drug addicts and alcoholics as ‘ victims ’ who are powerless to turn round their own lives , @entity2 warned today			1
the @entity10 said his own life was ‘ transformed ’ by good social workers , who took him into their care before he was adopted			2
in an emotional speech today he said the best social workers deserve to be viewed on a par with doctors , barristers and teachers , but he will warn that the training of social workers needs major reform			1
tough message : @entity2 , secretary of state for education , said some social workers ' acquiesce ' the bad choices of feckless parents mr @entity2 was born in august 1967 to a young student single mother , and was adopted four months later			1
describing his own experience today , he said : ‘ as someone who started their life in care , whose life was transformed because of the skill of social workers and the love of parents who were not my biological mother and father but who are - in every sense - my real mum and dad , this is personal			1
‘ a child ’s opportunity to flourish should not be a matter of chance - it should be the mission which guides all our actions			0
’ he warned : ‘ i believe that we have not been either systematic , radical or determined enough in our efforts to reform the system of child protection in this country			0
’ pledging to ‘ strip out ’ trendy attitudes within the profession , mr @entity2 said that many social workers believe their main role is to secure benefits and services for their clients rather than forcing them to address their problems			1
playing around : @entity2 aged 11 months with his mother @entity68 at the beach many are too quick to ‘ explain away ’ appalling behaviour that can lead to domestic violence and child abuse , he said			1
and he warned that the training of social workers needs major reform			2
‘ in too many cases , social work training involves idealistic students being told that the individuals with whom they will work have been disempowered by society , ’ he said			0
overhaul : sir @entity83 , above , the former chief executive of @entity84 's , is carrying out a review of social worker training ‘ they will be encouraged to see these individuals as victims of social injustice whose fate is overwhelmingly decreed by the economic forces and inherent inequalities which scar our society			2
‘ this analysis is , sadly as widespread as it is pernicious			0
it robs individuals of the power of agency and breaks the link between an individual ’s actions and the consequences			0
‘ it risks explaining away substance abuse , domestic violence and personal irresponsibility , rather than doing away with them			0
‘ social workers overly influenced by this analysis not only rob families of a proper sense of responsibility , they also abdicate their own			0
‘ they see their job as securing the family ’s access to services provided by others , rather than helping them to change their own approach to life			0
instead of working with individuals to get them to recognise harmful patterns of behaviour , and improve their own lives , some social workers acquiesce in or make excuses for these wrong choices			1
’ mr @entity2 ’s comments are made in a speech to the @entity133			1
they come ahead of the publication tomorrow of a serious case review into the shocking case of @entity138 who was starved to death by his mother and left in his cot for almost two years			0
sir @entity83 , the former head of @entity84 ’s , is currently carrying out a review of social worker training for mr @entity2 , and is expected to call for major changes			1
sources said mr @entity2 said better training was vital in improving standards in a profession that has been rocked by a string of scandals			2
mr @entity2 highlighted the success of the new ‘ @entity156 ’ initiative , which aims to fast - track top graduates into social work			2
more than 4,000 people have applied for the scheme in its first six weeks .			0

the minister 's comments will come in a speech to the @entity133
he believes too many ' explain away ' appalling behaviour by parents
@entity2 plans to tell workers their role is to address ' real problems '
