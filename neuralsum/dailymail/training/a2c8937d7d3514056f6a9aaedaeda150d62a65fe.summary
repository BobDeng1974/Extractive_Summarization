soaring numbers of under - 40s are developing a type of diabetes linked to obesity and traditionally seen as a disease of the elderly			1
a study of @entity9 ' records found the number of young people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes rose six-fold over two decades			1
the most common form of the disease , it is strongly linked to obesity and was once the preserve of the middle - aged and elderly			1
the number of people aged under 40 being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes is soaring , a new study has revealed			1
in this file picture , a patient uses a lancet to test blood glucose levels those who analysed the figures said the increase can ' almost entirely ' be explained by the obesity crisis – and warned developing diabetes early raises the odds of potentially deadly complications			2
diabetics are more likely to suffer heart attacks and strokes than other people			2
the condition , in which the body struggles to convert sugar to energy , also increases the risk of blindness , kidney disease and nerve and circulatory damage , which can lead to amputations			2
earlier onset gives the disease time to attack the body and could bring decades of ill health			2
the @entity48 already spends £ 10billion a year on diabetes – a tenth of its entire budget			0
the study of a snapshot of @entity9 ' surgeries found that from 1991 to 1995 , 577 people under 40 were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes			1
but from 2006 to 2010 , that soared to more than 14,000 – a more than 20-fold increase – with young women particularly likely to be diagnosed			1
a large part of this rise can be explained by changes in the way data is collected , and it is estimated the true rate of diagnosis in under - 40s is now around six times higher than in the 1990s , at around 25,000 new cases a year			1
obesity rates roughly doubled in the same period , with 26 per cent of adults dangerously overweight by 2010			0
growing numbers of under - 40s are developing type 2 diabetes , which is linked to obesity and traditionally seen as a disease of the elderly ( file picture ) in a report on their findings , published in the journal @entity81 , the researchers said : ' not only was the overall incidence increasing but the proportion of people aged 40 or less rose markedly			1
' this is likely to place an increasing burden on resources and may also lead to death at a younger age			0
' the researchers , from @entity91 and the @entity92 in @entity93 , said the rise may be partly due to better screening , since @entity9 now have performance - related pay that rewards them for diagnosing sufferers			1
however , they said rising obesity was the main driver			0
lead researcher professor @entity100 said : ' it 's almost entirely obesity			0
how fat you are is the top and bottom of it			0
' dr @entity105 , of the @entity106 , said even children in their early teens have been diagnosed			1
some are genetically more at risk but lifestyle is the key trigger , he said , adding : ' it 's still quite rare but we do see them			0
in the huge majority of cases type 2 diabetes develops as a consequence of being overweight			1
so as the weight of the nation increases , the incidence goes up too			0
' the implications for @entity48 spending are huge			0
it already spends about 10 per cent of its entire budget on diabetes			0
it 's not the diabetes that kills people but usually the heart disease they develop as a consequence			0
' professor @entity134 , of the @entity136 @entity135 , warned diabetes is the first in a chain of diseases fuelled by obesity			0
he said : ' it is likely that in a few years we will see a similar epidemic of cardiovascular disease and , after that , probably an increase in a good number of cancers as well			2

study of @entity9 ' records found number diagnosed has soared
type 2 was once the preserve of the middle - aged and elderly
but researchers said the rise may be partly due to better screening
