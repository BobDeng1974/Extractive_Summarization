a father sick of his teenage son 's battered car has put the ' dustbin ' motor on @entity5 , listing all the things wrong with it - and frankly asking , ' who would buy it ? ' @entity10 uses the advert to apologise for the state of the black @entity13 , which he says is full of litter and boasts multiple dents thanks to his son @entity17 's bad driving			1
among the many faults with the vehicle are a passenger seat which does n't move because girls are always getting in and out , according to the jokey @entity5 listing			1
battered : @entity10 is selling his son @entity17 's old @entity13 in a brutally frank @entity5 advert damage : the car is badly dented because of its teenage owner 's erratic driving , according to his father mr @entity10 , 50 , suggests that the car would be best for another teenager - because @entity17 's trashing of the vehicle ' will save them all the time and effort '			1
other problems with the 10 - year - old @entity38 include a slipping clutch , which its owner failed to notice because he 's always blasting loud music , his father said			2
the mischievous father , from @entity43 in @entity44 , is selling the car because @entity17 , 19 , has a new one - but mr @entity10 says the replacement vehicle ' will be coming up for sale in a similar state in some years to come '			1
he signs himself off as a ' devoted father with much patience ' , and admits the car has ' absolutely no warranty '			2
but despite the brutally honest advert , the online auction for the car - which has done 130,000 miles and would normally fetch £ 1,500 in good condition - has already reached £ 117 , with another five days left to run			1
defensive : @entity17 , pictured with his new @entity58 , says he is ' quite a clean person ' mr @entity10 said : ' i wrote the advert after my son 's car packed up and he had a bit of a panic			1
' he 's an estate agent so needed something nice to go to work in			2
i sat down and looked at the car and thought , who is really going to buy it anyway ? ' then i started grinning to myself about the things that he had done to the car			1
it 's just typical of a teenager			2
when we bought it there was nothing wrong with it			0
' i have had so many text messages and emails through @entity5 and on @entity80			1
some of the responses have been really great			0
i find it really amusing			0
' i do n't think my son expected so many people to read it			0
he might actually start to get a little bit embarrassed			0
' knackered : a handle has come off one of the car 's doors , and the upholstering has a tear in it but @entity17 said : ' i 'm not really embarrassed at all as my dad cracks jokes all the time			1
he thinks he 's really funny			0
' i had n't even sat down from work when he started reeling the advert off to me			0
i think he 's been quite pleased with the attention - he put his best clothes on for the photo			1
' there are certain ground rules with my new car			0
i 'm not allowed food or @entity101 's			0
no smoking and no girls except my girlfriend			0
he 's a joker really because i 'm quite a clean person			0
' even @entity5 users with no interest in buying the car expressed appreciation for the humorous tone of the listing			1
@entity112 , 25 , wrote : ' thanks for entertaining me and my friends for five minutes whilst we read your @entity5 article			1
' i 'd like to take this opportunity to wish you the utmost luck in selling your son 's car			1
we actually considering buying it for a laugh at one point			0
' this car belonged to my 19 - year - old son , who now has a new car , i can only apologise for the state of it , clearly he will treat his new one the same			1
ok , the passenger side has a large dent on it , were my son tried to climb the corner of my house , i did tell him that if he is going to insist on going back and forth on the wall the dent will get bigger ! ! ! and the driveway is only 10ft wide after all			0
the clutch is now slipping , again he did not know this , as loud music is the preferred thing , and could not hear it slipping , just wondered why it took him longer to get up a hill ! ! ! still there is enough clutch left to get you home , i think ? surprisingly the electric windows still work well , considering the amount of times they go up and down calling to his mates , and banter with the passing girls , many of whom have been taken for rides in the car , which may explain the passenger seat not moving back and forth anymore , still makes it hard for them to escape his deafening music			2
honest : this advert lists all the flaws of the car , which dates back to 2005 and has done 130,000 miles there may or may not be any oil and water in the car , despite me repeatedly telling him to make sure it was maintained , i believe he thought this meant sitting in it on the driveway listening to his music whilst having a smoke , he would have washed it occasionally , but said ' not really worth it now is it dad ' , as it 's got a big dent on it ! ! ! and anyway , surely i would know if it needed oil , the red light would come on ! ! still he does have a brand new set of mats in the boot , bought when he first had the car			2
there may be the odd ripple in the front of the bonnet , but according to my son that was there when it was bought for him , and nothing to do with sitting and chilling on it , may be it was a better place to sit than the passenger seat ! ! it does have the other alloy wheel in the boot , with a puncture , but if he gets another puncture he will use one of the other three on the car			2
the drivers seat has a hole in it , this was done killing time , whilst stuck on the side of the house performing modifications to the side of the car			0
the rear of the car is in fact a large dustbin for discarded fruit , and @entity229 's , not for carrying passengers , but still he says he 's loving it ! ! ! anyway if you think this car may be suitable for your son , please go ahead and buy it , it 's after all in the perfect state for any teenager lad , and will save them all the time and effort that my son has put in to it , getting it this way			1
it 's now down to me to dispose of this wonderful car i bought him many years ago , now he has a new one , he thinks that you just leave it parked on the side of the road until someone comes and takes it			2
it 's not how he has treated the car since he has owned it that worries me , its the fact that he now has a new 14 plate car , which incidentally will be coming up for sale in a similar state in some years to come , although he informs me he will look after this one because it has ' no dents ' , and is clean and shiny , and does n't need washing , to my surprise he went and bought a new set of mats for it - ' they 're in the boot ' , is this history repeating itself ? when i told my son i was selling it , because he now had a new car , he said well who gets the money ? i said me of course , but it wo n't be much as the car has had it , to which he then replied , ' that 's not fair , it 's a good car , nothing wrong with it , ' and that he should get the cash			1
i offer absolutely no warranty with this car , and many thanks for looking			0
@entity10 , a devoted father with much patience .			0

@entity288 has *decided* to sell teenage son @entity17 's @entity13
he put it on @entity5 *accompanied* with listing titled ' who would buy it ? '
says the seats are broken because @entity17 is always giving girls a lift
also points out dents in the car and rubbish filling up the interior
but the listing has already *attracted* bids of more than £ 100
