@entity0 announced his international retirement on sunday night after manager @entity2 picked @entity3 instead for his 23 - man @entity6 @entity5 squad			1
@entity3 , the 18 - year - old @entity7 left back , will be one of at least eight players under the age of 24 — including @entity11 playmaker @entity10 , 20 — named by @entity2 at 2pm on monday			1
@entity0 revealed the news on @entity13 on sunday night , posting a series of emotional messages after being told by @entity2 he would not be going to @entity16			1
i think it best i retire from the @entity6 team now			2
‘ we have a great manager and team and i wish them only success			0
i will be supporting them like a true fan			0
thanks to everyone for everything			0
‘ @entity41 and @entity3 are great players , proved this season , and are the future of this country			1
it was a pleasure to get 107 caps			1
‘ like me or not , trust me it ’s hurt me to stop playing for my country			0
’ it is understood that @entity0 refused to go on @entity2 ’s @entity5 squad standby list , believing that at the age of 33 and with a long @entity6 career behind him , he has nothing more to prove			1
@entity57 ’s @entity56 will be named on the reserve list to provide cover for @entity41 and @entity3			1
@entity2 said : ‘ this has been one of the hardest decisions of my career			0
the most important factor was speaking to @entity0 prior to the announcement			1
he deserved to hear it directly from me and he took the news with huge grace			0
give youth a chance : @entity71 is said to have missed a call from @entity6 manager @entity2 named : @entity11 youngster @entity74 is also in the squad facing the axe : @entity78 pair @entity77 ( left ) and @entity79 are expected to miss out ‘ i must respect his decision to retire			1
he has been one of @entity6 ’s finest players , but i want to look to the future			2
’ along with @entity3 and @entity10 , @entity84 ( 22 ) , @entity85 ( 23 ) , @entity86 ( 22 ) , @entity87 ( 19 ) , @entity88 ( 20 ) and @entity89 ( 23 ) will be named in the travelling party			1
@entity3 has enjoyed an impressive season at @entity92 ’s and was on sunday night reported to be the subject of a £ 27million bid from @entity78			1
his chances of being named in the squad were given a massive lift when @entity2 decided not to attend @entity0 ’s comeback match for @entity26 in the @entity100 semi-final first leg last month			1
@entity10 , who has come to prominence again after his special strike against @entity103 on may 3 , has made three appearances for his country			2
he was rested from @entity11 ’s 2 - 0 victory at @entity108 ’s @entity107 on sunday but his emergence is likely to signal the end of @entity77 ’s international career after a difficult season with @entity78			2
risky : @entity113 duo @entity88 ( above ) and @entity86 ( below ) will both be included despite their injury concerns although @entity77 was named @entity78 ’s player of the year in their last title - winning season under sir @entity119 , he has never established himself as a regular international under @entity2			1
his @entity78 team - mate @entity79 , who has n’t played for @entity6 since a qualifier against @entity123 in september , is also facing the axe			0
although @entity2 insisted this month he is under no pressure from @entity127 chairman @entity126 to pick young players , he will take at least eight with fewer than 10 caps each			2
@entity6 ’s @entity132 coach @entity131 hinted last week that the full squad , who report for a @entity5 training camp on may 19 , will have a younger feel to it			1
@entity131 , who names his squad for the under 20 tournament in @entity140 on tuesday , met @entity2 last week to discuss his selections			2
@entity2 claims he made his choices several weeks ago and has been unmoved by the form of a number of players			0
he will include @entity113 duo @entity88 and @entity86 despite their injury problems			1
@entity88 returns to training this week and is in contention for a place in the @entity153 final against @entity108 at @entity154 on saturday			2
keeping his place : @entity84 has overcome his shoulder problem to make the 23 fire power : @entity2 will stand by @entity158 , who was a vital part of the qualifying campaign @entity113 manager @entity161 said : ‘ the news is good — he should re-integrate into our squad for normal training			1
he is available to @entity2 and i would n’t be surprised if he is picked			0
’ @entity86 played 27 minutes at @entity166 yesterday in his first appearance since hobbling off with a fractured foot during @entity6 ’s friendly against @entity169 on march 5			2
@entity161 added : ‘ @entity170 is one month away , that ’s plenty of time			0
it just shows you he has no problem to be available			0
’ @entity2 ’s striking options were restricted last month when @entity7 ’s @entity176 ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in a @entity179 game at @entity103			0
his absence means clubmate @entity158 , who scored against @entity78 yesterday , is likely to keep his place in the 23			0
@entity182 , who moved to @entity185 side @entity183 in january , may have to make do with a place on stand - by			0
@entity166 keeper @entity187 , who has n’t played for @entity6 since the friendly against @entity189 in august 2012 , will miss out			0
overlooked : @entity183 striker @entity182 will be placed on stand - by replacement : @entity187 ( left ) will lose his place as the third choice goalkeeper to @entity192			0

@entity3 will go to the @entity5 ahead of @entity0
@entity0 , who has 107 caps , will retire from international football
@entity3 , 18 , is one of eight players in the squad aged under 24
