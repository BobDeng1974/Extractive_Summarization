@entity8 , 52 , faces court action over the accident which left six people dead and a further 29 still missing			1
the captain told a journalist at the @entity15 paper dnes that the risk of a modern disaster was much lower because of safety systems that had been put in place			1
interview : @entity8 , captain of the @entity2 , said in a newspaper interview that modern ships were easier to navigate sunk : a rescue boat and a helicopter patrol near the doomed cruise liner yesterday after it ran aground			1
six people have been confirmed dead , 29 more are missing but he added : ' i would n't like to be in the role of the captain of the @entity5 , having to sail in an ocean of icebergs			1
' however , when pressed on the impact of the 1912 disaster and the long - term impact it had on shipping , he responded : luckily , people forget about tragedies '			1
the £ 400million liner which crashed , with 4,200 passengers and crew , was sailing just 300 yards from the island ’s rocky coast when it should have been at least four miles out to sea			2
following the accident thousands have taken to @entity47 to vent their fury at the so - called ‘ @entity49 ’ , who is now claimed to have ‘ skimmed ’ past the @entity52 isle of @entity53 not just to salute a retired officer but also to impress his head waiter ’s family on shore			1
after the collision there was allegedly a delay of more than 30 minutes before the coastguard knew about it			2
captain : @entity8 had skippered the ship for the past six years the first the authorities heard of the accident was when they were alerted by passengers on the ship			1
captain @entity8 told the newspaper in his interview 13 months ago that the risk of a cruise ship accident was much reduced in the 21st century			1
' these days , everything is much safer			2
it is easier to navigate thanks to modern technical instruments and the internet , ' he said			1
' if an error occurs , it is not so serious , because we are better prepared for possible complications			2
' using the internet we know straightaway the weather conditions and the situation that we 'll find in the ports that we are heading to			1
and it 's easy to take important decisions			2
' he added that he enjoyed the unpredictable and liked to face a challenge when in control of a cruise ship			1
' i enjoy moments when something unpredictable happens , when you can diverge a bit from standard procedures			1
it 's a challenge to face , i enjoy it , ' he said			2
after swiftly escaping from the @entity2 quickly after friday 's accident , captain @entity8 was arrested along with first officer @entity100			1
clear - up : an oil removal ship is seen enar the @entity2 last night which ran aground off @entity53 rescue teams search for missing people around the partially - submerged cruise ship in the harbour or the @entity53 yesterday search : a helicopter hovers over the doomed cruise ship			1
the captain faces court action over the disaster the captain was spotted wrapped in a blanket on his way to the shore at around 11.30pm – more than four hours before the evacuation of the vessel was completed and breaking the maritime tradition of remaining with his ship			1
coastguards are said to have told him to ‘ get back on board your vessel ’ once they realised he was safe on the island but he failed to do so			1
underwater search : a scuba diver swims next to the @entity2 in this photo released by the @entity132 coastguard yesterday in the december 2010 newspaper interview he stressed that he was ' constantly vigilant ' and said ' every moment on a ship is important to me ' and he had never been in a dangerous situation			2
the @entity138 reported that he added : ' i think that 's down to the fact that i prepare myself every day of the voyage			2
i have to be constantly vigilant			0
' i believe that with thorough preparation we are able to keep any situation under control			0
' captain @entity8 has been skipper of the @entity2 for the last six years			1
he has a wife and a daughter			0
abandon ship : dancer @entity149 , 19 , pictured next to the cruise liner , said the instruction to evacuate the vessel should have been made an hour earlier preventing pollution in the sea surrounding the sunken @entity2 will be a ' race against time ' , but the ship could be sailing again in future with a lot of hard work and a lot of money , according to a maritime expert			0
@entity162 , editor of @entity163 , says that although the ship 's tanks are in protected locations , there may be ' some small spillage ' from the 17 tanks , which contain a total of 500,000 gallons of fuel , because of the current position of the cruise liner			0
he also says that while holidaymakers may not be rushing to book themselves a cabin on the luxury ship , it is possible that @entity2 could be repaired and back in service some time in 2013			0
' it would take an awful lot of work and a lot of money			0
it would be a year at least before it would be in a serviceable condition and the question is would anybody really want to go on it ? ' would you go on a ship that has been in that condition ? would you think it was unlucky or what ? it 'll always be a hard sell to get people to go on it , that 's my opinion , ' said mr @entity162			1
he said that pollution was something the shipping industry dreaded the most			0
' it is an issue , it 's always an issue in these cases			0
it 's what we in the industry hate to see because the pollution aspect of oil , and when you see oil tankers go aground , more than anything else , puts public opinion against the shipping industry , ' he said			0
the maritime expert added : ' the longer it sits there ... the waves are very very forceful			0
a powerful force is acting on the ship			0
' a ship is designed to float , it 's not designed to be sat on the bottom so while it 's pushed about and prodded , and kicked around by the wind and waves , stresses will come on it and wells will crack			0
' however , he did add that although preventing pollution from a spillage would be hard work and ' not the easiest job in the world ' , it would not be ' rocket science '			0
the ship 's operator , @entity241 , has enlisted @entity243 of @entity244 , one of the world 's biggest salvagers , to handle the removal of the 290 - metre cruise liner			0
yesterday he said on @entity132 television he did not understand why the ship had hit the rocks			0
' even though we were sailing along the coast with the tourist navigation system , i firmly believe the rocks were n't detected , ' he said			1
' the ship was n't heading forward but sideways as if under water there was this rock projection			1
' i do n't know if it was detected or not , but on the nautical chart it was marked just as water and some 100 - 150 metres ( 330ft - 500ft ) from the rocks , and we were about 300 metres from the shore , more or less			1
' we should n't have had this contact			1
' a dancer who helped to direct petrified passengers off the ship said yesterday the instruction to abandon ship should have been given ' an hour earlier , if not more '			0
@entity149 , 19 , had been working as an entertainer on the cruise liner for six months when it ran aground in the @entity276			0
he said : ' we started to lean to the port side ... it got more and more dramatic and everyone seemed to know that it was n't just a normal turn , we were turning unbelievably sharply			2
' i was thrown out of bed and then as i stood there all my aftershave and a bottle of wine came towards me as i was catching things and smashed on my foot			0
' the teenager said an announcement over the ship 's intercom system urged passengers to stay calm and assured them that there was simply a ' minor technical fault '			2
but a coded series of beeps was sounded to let crew know that there was a leak on board			0
mr @entity149 , from @entity303 , @entity304 , said : ' we had an announcement saying please stay calm , everything is under control , it 's just a minor technical fault			2
' then we had the coding of two short blasts followed by alternate tones which means there is a leak on board and so the crew were divided , very much so			0
' a lot of people said , ' no just tell everyone to stay calm , that 's what we 've been told to say '			1
' but then other people took the initiative and said , " okay , let 's tell everyone to stay calm but hand over life jackets "			2
' mr @entity149 said he put on warm clothes and a life jacket before making his way to a pre-arranged meeting point , helping passengers along the way			0
he said : ' we thought it was a " just in case " scenario but then we started to lift and started to tilt and we knew something was deadly wrong			0
' we knew we were going to have to do something drastic to get out of the situation we were in			0

skipper @entity8 told interviewer : ' i would n't like to be captain of the @entity5 '
he said modern ships are ' easier to navigate thanks to technical instruments and the internet '
the captain , 52 , said he ' enjoyed the unpredictable ' and liked to diverge from standard procedure
