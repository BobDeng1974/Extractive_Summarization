by @entity0 published : 13:16 est , 26 november 2013 @entity2 : 04:45 est , 27 november 2013 a @entity4 probe that will map more than a billion stars in @entity6 is set to revolutionise astronomy , according to scientists , who have announced the start of its launch countdown			1
@entity13 scientists and engineers have played key roles in the design and construction of the 840 million pound spacecraft , called @entity19			1
the two - tonne robot is due to be blasted into orbit on a @entity24 @entity23 rocket from the @entity4 space port in @entity26 on december 19			1
an artist 's impression of @entity19 , the £ 840 million spacecraft that will map more than a billion stars in @entity6			2
it will pinpoint many millions of stars in our galaxy , the @entity34 , with unparalleled precision and aims to yield clues about mysterious dark matter and dark energy the mission , which will last five years , is designed to discover thousands of previously unknown objects , including exploding stars , planets orbiting other suns and nearby asteroids			1
it will also pinpoint many millions of stars in our galaxy , the @entity34 , with unparalleled precision and aims to yield clues about mysterious dark matter and dark energy			1
@entity19 will operate from a stable location one - and - a - half - million kilometres from the @entity50 known as the @entity52 lagrangian point			0
situated with the @entity50 between it and the @entity55 , the spacecraft will be perfectly placed to observe the wider universe			0
as it spins slowly , two telescopes will sweep across the entire sky and simultaneously focus their light on the largest digital camera ever flown in space			0

the five - year mission is said to be the most ambitious in space history the flood of data produced by the mission will be enough to fill more than 30,000 cd roms			1
@entity13 's principal @entity19 investigator professor @entity71 , from @entity72 , said : ' the results from @entity19 will revolutionise our understanding of the cosmos as never before			2
' our understanding of what 's out there has been driven by looking at what we can see			0
we 've never had a genuine opportunity to look at everything , to know what 's there , and to know where they are in relation to each other			0
' we do n't even know how much we do n't know - there are sure to be objects out there that do n't even have names yet , since we do n't yet realise how strange they are			2
' there are literally hundreds of questions like this - why is the universe the way it is ? where did the @entity34 come from ? what 's it really made of ? exactly how much does it weigh ? how did it get to be like it is ? the @entity19 craft is tested in a lab in @entity26 before it was launched			1
it is @entity4 's successor to the @entity110 satellite which mapped around 100,000 stars ' we will go beyond what we can see to understand reality			2
we are going to discover completely new things - things we would think are impossible			2
' @entity13 universities and companies won around £ 67 million worth of contracts from the @entity119 to build key components of the spacecraft , including its camera sensors and micro-propulsion system			1
a state - of - the - art processing centre at @entity72 will sift and digest massive amounts of raw data from the probe			0
@entity19 will operate from a stable location one - and - a - half - million kilometres from the @entity50 known as the @entity52 lagrangian point			0
situated with the @entity50 between it and the @entity55 ( illustrated ) , the spacecraft will be perfectly placed to observe the wider universe dr @entity134 , manager of @entity19 data processing in the @entity13 , said : ' the sensors on board the spacecraft will be able to detect objects so faint the human eye would have to be nearly 4,000 times more powerful to see them			1
' this accuracy is equivalent to measuring a shirt button on the moon as seen from the @entity50			0
it means we have to have the highest - capability computers to analyse the data			0
' @entity19 will help scientists investigating two of astronomy 's greatest mysteries , @entity153 and @entity154			0
as @entity19 ( pictured ) slowly , two telescopes will sweep across the entire sky and simultaneously focus their light on the largest digital camera ever flown in space			0
the flood of data produced by the mission will be enough to fill more than 30,000 cd roms dark matter is an invisible substance that glues galaxies together , yet can not be detected other than by observing its gravitational effects			1
@entity169 is a strange propulsive force that appears to be hard - wired into the fabric of space itself and is causing galaxies to fly apart at an accelerating rate			2
the probe will also be able to detect far - off solar systems with their own families of planets , and , closer to home , spot potentially threatening asteroids whose orbits reach out as far as @entity50			0
@entity19 will help scientists investigating two of astronomy 's greatest mysteries , dark matter and dark energy here , @entity19 's @entity183 rests at the @entity4 space port in @entity26			1
