by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 is relieved to at last be heading to a @entity3 without any fitness worries			1
the @entity6 forward has flattered to deceive at major international tournaments since his remarkable breakthrough at @entity9			1
then only 18 , @entity2 netted four goals , with his performances earning him a place in @entity15 's team of the tournament and a move to @entity18			1
pressure : @entity2 ( left ) has failed to score a @entity3 goal for @entity21 despite making the squad in 2006 and 2010 gutted : @entity2 headed into his first @entity3 in 2006 with an injury suffered for @entity6 a decade on , he has yet to replicate that form for @entity21 and will be looking to amends at what will be his third @entity3 this summer			1
@entity2 had to rush back from a metatarsal injury to feature in 2006 and carried an ankle injury into the tournament in @entity32 , although there are no mitigating circumstances this time around having come through @entity21 's 0 - 0 draw with @entity36 in @entity37			1
' i am happy going to this final feeling fit , ' @entity2 said			1
' i have played in every training session and i am excited			0
' i am ready to play ready to enjoy it and hopefully ready to do well			0
' i feel good and obviously playing against @entity42 ( and the other matches ) will have helped me as well after missing the games at the end of the season			0
' i have trained hard feel good and am ready to play			0
' dejected : @entity2 trudges off the pitch after @entity21 's disappointing 0 - 0 draw with @entity36 @entity2 , now 28 , should be at the peak of his powers as an attacker , despite former @entity6 team - mate @entity53 suggesting otherwise			1
those comments were laughed off by the forward , although he is aware of the importance of finally impressing on the world stage			0
if he is to impress , @entity2 may well have to do it from an unfavoured role on the left flank			2
five years ago he said the position restricted him in terms of expression , although he impressed when deployed there in wednesday 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity42			0
going for goal : @entity2 ( left ) bends a free - kick towards goal during the first half ' i have played there quite a lot in my career , ' @entity2 said			2
' i have played left and right , more so on the left			0
' the manager asked me to play there and i have no problem doing it			0
' i am not going to stop playing for @entity21 because i was moved out on to the left wing am i ? i am happy to play for @entity21 where i am needed			2

the @entity6 man has not performed well at a major tournament since @entity9
he was rushed back from a metatarsal injury for the @entity3 in 2006
' i am happy going to this final feeling fit , ' @entity2 said
