by @entity0 it 's rare to find a designer who sticks to her style guns through thick and thin but @entity4 is n't your average fashion creative			1
true to form , this was a collection carefully calibrated to appeal to the ladylike , the kitten of heeled and the violently allergic to @entity11 's wackier names			2
no wonder , then , that @entity4 counts the ever - elegant @entity13 among her faithful fans and although the prime minister 's wife did n't put in an appearance , she 's very likely to put in an order or two			1
granted , there was nothing particularly new about the silhouette , which with its neat bell skirt and nipped in waist said 1950s rather than now , although it was undeniably pretty			2
but newness is n't what @entity4 is really about : instead , she wants to make clothes that women really want to wear , whether they 're @entity13 or a mother - of - two from deepest @entity47			1
and wearable , @entity4 's thoroughly feminine collection was			1
delicate flowing dresses lifted with stripes and bearing forgiving @entity53 waistlines			0
bold hues : @entity4 plumped for vibrant shades of cornflower blue and buttercup yellow vintage : @entity4 stayed true to her flatteringly feminine style @entity60 : boldly coloured striped gave the collection an airy feel elegant : a shirt dress that 's bound to find favour at no. 10 neat skirt suits with bell - shaped skirts and beautifully tailored jackets			1
a vibrant orange and pink striped dress with a 50 's @entity72 skirt			0
and an utterly gorgeous lightweight tailored coat			0
like the fabrics , colours were sumptuous with buttercup yellow , delicate blush pink , shimmering cornflower blue and vibrant crimson among the most eye - catching			2
there was the odd touch of print , a charmingly quirky piano motif , but nothing to scare the horses - it was playful @entity89 at its best			0
all shimmered together beautifully , never breaking stride or indeed a sweat			0
no falls , no drama , no silliness			0
all was well in the world of @entity4			1
special thanks to @entity96 and @entity97 for driving the @entity99 team around during @entity100 .			0

@entity4 is *famous* for her flatteringly feminine designs
@entity13 is a fan and *regularly* wears her gowns
sumptuous new collection more than lived up to *expectations*
