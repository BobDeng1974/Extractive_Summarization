a man 's unique charity challenge has become a selfie sensation after he successful spent the month of september taking photos with complete strangers			1
he has taken selfies with @entity6 outside @entity7 , posed thousands of feet in the air above @entity10 and he even gatecrashed a couples wedding photos in @entity12			1
@entity13 , 35 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , has finished his ' @entity17 september ' challenge after coming up with the idea to raise money for @entity20			1
he said : ' the best moments along the way were seeing the reactions of a person after you interrupt their day			0
@entity13 , from @entity14 , @entity26 , said the favourite part of his @entity28 was interrupting a @entity30 wedding ( above ) ' the initial reaction is a kind of ' what do you want , why are you talking to me , is this a scam , do you want money from me , i do n't even know you '			2
but as soon as they realise all i want is a photo , and the pressure of donation is totally up to them at a later stage , their face changes completely			0
' his idea to take photos of complete stranger not only helped him meet a whole host of people but it also raised awareness of the charity , as well as having a huge amount of fun			2
' my favourite moment was interrupting a @entity30 wedding as not only did i manage it , i broke the language barrier , ' said mr @entity13			1
a selfie with the @entity6 outside @entity7 , 34 - year - old mr @entity13 set himself the task of taking a photograph of himself with someone he does n't know every day for the entire month he is trying to start a new fundraising craze with his selfie campaign , in aid of @entity20 ' excuse me , i said , can i have a photo with you please ? the groom looked confused , but the bride said ' @entity70 ' , then when i got my phone out and got myself into the shot the groom remarked ' @entity74 '			1
it was such a great moment			0
' mr @entity13 has his fair few ups and downs during the challenge and admits it was a struggle at times to approach people , with his main regret of missing out on a selfie with former @entity85 football star @entity84			1
he added : ' it takes a lot to go up to a complete stranger , and interrupt their day and then to ask for a photo			0
some people just do n't want to be bothered and would rather go about their day and some just plain do n't like their photo being taken			0
' it really knocks the stuffing out of you when you are refused a selfie , but each time it has happened i just think about the reason i am doing this and soldier my mum has had breast cancer and other family members have also been through some very tough times , we have lost close friends and family so this was the reason behind choosing @entity20			2
' mr @entity13 hoped on raising just £ 200 through the challenge , but ended up with almost £ 500 , which is a figure that is still rising			1
mr @entity13 is taking a selfie with at least one stranger every single day , or in this case , several during a hen do a selfie at the beach : mr @entity13 took a selfie with a stranger every single day in september an effort to start a new fundraising craze ' i did think the idea had potential , but i am a little overwhelmed at just how well it has all gone , ' mr @entity13 , following his idea which has inspired others to take part in the challenge for there chosen charity			1
' after the first couple of days , i had discussed all kinds of charities with different people			0
@entity136 , raising for mental health charity mind , and @entity138 , for @entity139 , which help with the prevention of young suicides , both approached me stating that they wished they had thought of the idea			0
' it was then that i asked them to set up their own ' just giving ' page then join the @entity17 teams page			0
this was exactly the reaction i wanted and still hope others will join us and we can all raise money together but for our own causes at the same time			0
' together the group raised around £ 1000 for their chosen charities as they hope to start a ' chain reaction ' of people looking to take up the challenge for a month			2
mr @entity13 and his team will also be holding a ' super selfie session ' to official end their month long challenge at a @entity163 in @entity14 on sunday , october 12 , taking as many snaps with strangers as possible			2
