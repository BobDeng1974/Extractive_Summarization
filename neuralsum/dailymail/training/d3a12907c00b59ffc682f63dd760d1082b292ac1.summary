living in the city can be cramped , with large numbers of urban dwellers living cheek by jowl in shoebox apartments			0
now it seems that urban animals like rabbits also suffer from similar pitfalls of a city lifestyle			1
while rabbit populations in rural areas have been declining due to hunting and habitat loss , their numbers have apparently remained strong in the urban areas they inhabit			1
however , these city rabbits live in far smaller and simpler warrens than their rural counterparts - the bunny equivalent of studio apartments			1
rabbits living in city parks , like these in @entity26 , adopt different lifestyles compared to their country relatives biologists have found that living in cities may be changing the brains of animals there			1
white - footed mice and meadow voles living in cities have brains that are on average six per cent larger than those of the same species found in the countryside			1
scientists at the @entity41 who have been studying the phenomenon believe the animals are showing ' complex cognitive responses to both urban and rural areas '			0
the animals did not show changes in body size , which suggests the larger brains is not simply a developmental response to better nutrition and access to food afforded by living alongside humans			2
instead they believe the complexities of the ever changing city environment may be driving the species that live there to become more adaptable			2
as a result , animals that are more flexible survive in this environment and pass on their genes , something that may be causing their brains to increase in size			0
biologists also found the city rabbits also tended to live in smaller family groups			1
so , just like for their human neighbours , living in a city is a much more lonely way of life than in the countryside			1
the research was conducted by dr @entity78 and his student @entity79 at @entity80			2
miss @entity79 said : ' @entity82 densities increased along the rural - to - urban gradient , accompanied by a gradual shift from accumulated towards more evenly distributed burrows			0
' @entity82 became smaller and less complex with increasing degree of urbanity , and accordingly , also the number of rabbits inhabiting the same burrow decreased			2
' in the study , which is published in the @entity92 , examined rabbit populations in @entity94 and the surrounding area			1
they looked at 191 burrows in nine city parks , four suburban parks and three nearby rural sites			0
by staking our burrows at night , using tagging and flushing out the inhabitants with trained ferrets , the researchers were able to build up a picture of how the rabbits in each area were living along with how many entrances there were to each warren			0
they found that rabbits in more urban areas tended to live in simpler warrens with fewer entrances			1
there were also fewer rabbits in each warren			2
however , the burrows were packed more tightly together			0
the city rabbits had fewer entrances to their warrens than their rural relatives and had smaller burrows european rabbits , like this one , have been declining across @entity126 due to disease , hunting and loss of habitat the reason for this , say the researchers , could be because food supplies in cities are far more reliable than in the countryside			1
rabbit tend to form larger groups when food is in short supply			2
it could also be because cities tend to be a couple of degrees warmer than the surrounding countryside , meaning the rabbits no longer need to live together in one warren to keep each other warm			1
there may also be fewer predators in cities , meaning the rabbits need fewer escape routes from their homes			1
this may be among the underlying reasons for rabbits moving to cities in the first place			0
in their native @entity159 populations of @entity126 rabbits have declined by 20 per cent since 1975 while in @entity162 they have fallen by 24 per cent			0
rabbits have been living in parks in @entity94 , above , since the 1930s and have adapted to the packed city life in the @entity168 there were thought to be up to 100 million rabbits living around the country but disease and habitat change has seen those numbers fall			1
a government survey in 1995 estimated that there were 37.5 million rabbits left , but new diseases such as rabbit haemorrhagic disease may have reduced their numbers further			0
a recent study estimated that rabbit numbers had fallen by 48 per cent since 1993			0
miss @entity79 said that the carefully maintained mosaic - like habitats that spring up around cities may provide a more stable environment for rabbits than in agricultural areas			0
speaking to @entity189 , @entity188 added : ' cities are providing a constant and high food supply through human waste and deliberate feeding , as well as access to vegetation cover , such as shrubs			0
' many areas in modern cities are often structurally highly diverse and the urban rabbit population could be benefiting from this			0

biologists at @entity80 found rabbits are adapting to city life
their homes are becoming simpler and smaller than those in the country
while warrens are built closer together , the animals live in smaller groups
the lifestyle change may be caused by *plentiful* food and fewer predators
rabbit populations are in decline in the countryside but are steady in cities
