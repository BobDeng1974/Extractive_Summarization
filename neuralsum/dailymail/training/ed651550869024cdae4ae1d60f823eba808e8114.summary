by @entity0 published : 05:23 est , 24 april 2012 updated : 02:00 est , 25 april 2012 more than 700 inmates on @entity2 in @entity3 could have their sentences converted to life in prison without parole if state voters decide to abolish the death penalty			1
@entity3 will soon get the chance to decide whether to replace the death penalty with a no - parole life sentence , after it was decided a measure to abolish capital punishment now qualified for a ballot in november , secretary of state @entity10 said			1
if it passes , it would mean the sentence of life without parole would be the harshest penalty prosecutors could seek and all 725 inmates on @entity2 could have their sentences converted			1

@entity3 has 714 inmates on death row , costing $ 184 million more per year than those sentenced to life in prison without parole death row : an inmate sits at a table with a towel draped over his head , left , in the @entity36 section at @entity23			1
pictured right is an execution chamber at the prison - with the lethal injection table inside waiting room : file photo of the execution holding cells at @entity23 in @entity45 , @entity3 should @entity3 abolish the death penalty ? backers of the measure say abolishing the death penalty will save the state millions of dollars through layoffs of prosecutors and defense attorneys who handle death penalty cases , as well as savings from not having to maintain the nation 's largest death row at @entity23			1
those savings , supporters argue , can be used to help unsolved crimes			2
if the measure passes , $ 100 million in purported savings from abolishing the death penalty would be used over three years to investigate unsolved murders and rapes			2
the measure is dubbed the @entity64 , and @entity65 , ' also known as the @entity66			2
it 's the fifth measure to qualify for the november ballot , the secretary of state announced on monday			2
supporters collected more than the 504,760 valid signatures needed to place the measure on the ballot			2
@entity73 , the former warden of @entity23 who is now an anti-death penalty advocate and an official supporter of the measure , said : ' our system is broken , expensive and it always will carry the grave risk of a mistake			2
' the measure will also require most inmates sentenced to life without parole to find jobs within prisons			1
most death row inmates do not hold prison jobs for security reasons			1
though @entity3 is one of 35 states that still authorises the death penalty , the state has n't put anyone to death since 2006			2
a federal judge that year halted executions until prison officials built a new death chamber at @entity23 , developed new lethal injection protocols and made other improvements to delivering the lethal three - drug combination			2
walking dead : a prisoner on @entity2 is led back to his cell in @entity3 's @entity23 in 2003			1
due to legal challenges and long delays , the state has n't executed anyone since 2006 , despite a crowded death row last to face the death penalty : @entity111 ( left ) was executed in january 2006 for the murder of three people			0
@entity114 ( right ) was executed a year earlier for the murder of two people during a drug deal demonstration : anti-death penalty protesters raise their arms in support of @entity121 , who was executed at @entity23 in 2005			0
the death penalty remains controversial a separate state lawsuit is challenging the way the @entity125 developed the new protocols			0
a judge in @entity45 earlier this year ordered the @entity125 to redraft its lethal injection protocols , further delaying executions			0
since @entity3 reinstated the death penalty in 1978 , the state has executed 13 inmates			1
a 2009 study conducted by a senior federal judge and law school professor concluded that the state was spending about $ 184 million a year to maintain @entity2 and the death penalty system			1
the last inmates to be executed in @entity3 were at @entity23			1
@entity111 was executed in january 2006 for the murder of three people			0
@entity114 was executed a year earlier for the murder of two people during a drug deal			0
supporters of the proposition , such as the @entity146 , are portraying it as a cost - savings measure in a time of political austerity			0
they count several prominent conservatives and prosecutors - including the author of the 1978 measure adopting the death penalty - as supporters and argue that too few executions have been carried out at too great a cost			0
' our system is broken , expensive and it always will carry the grave risk of a mistake ' ' my conclusion is that he law is totally ineffective , ' said @entity166 , a former @entity167 district attorney			0
' most inmates are going to die of natural causes , not executions			1
' @entity166 , who served as district attorney from 1992 to 2000 , said he changed his mind after publication of the 2009 study , which was published by judge @entity175 of the 9th @entity176 and law professor @entity177			0
opponents of the measure , such as former @entity180 , argue that lawyers filing ' frivolous appeals ' are the problem , not the death penalty law			0
' on behalf of crime victims and their loved ones who have suffered at the hands of @entity3 's most violent criminals , we are disappointed that the @entity146 and their allies would seek to score political points in their continued efforts to override the will of the people and repeal the death penalty , ' said @entity180 , who is chairman of the @entity196 , a coalition of law enforcement officials , crime victims and others formed to oppose the measure			0
the criminal justice @entity201 , meanwhile , remains one the biggest backers of the death penalty in the state and opposes the latest attempt to abolish it in @entity3			0
the foundation and its supports argue that federal judges are gumming up the process with endless delays and reversals of state @entity214 rulings upholding individual death sentences			1
the foundation on thursday filed a lawsuit seeking the immediate resumption of executions in @entity3			0
the foundation 's lawsuit , filed directly with the state @entity223 , argues that since the three - drug method has been the subject of so much litigation - and the source of the execution delays - a one - drug method of lethal injection like @entity232 uses can be substituted immediately .			0
