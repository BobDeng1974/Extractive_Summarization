but it is no longer a problem for these three dachshunds after their owners bought them a £ 1,500 stairlift			2
@entity12 and @entity13 installed the lift after one of the dogs , six - year - old @entity17 , had to undergo a £ 5,000 operation on her spine			1
off to bed : @entity17 , bottom , @entity22 , top left , and @entity24 , top right , glide gracefully to bed in their £ 1,500 stairlift they had been concerned about @entity17 and their other dachshunds – @entity24 , seven , and @entity22 six – straining their low - slung bodies as they negotiated the stairs to their beds			1
‘ we saw an advertisement for the stairlift and thought “ why not ? ” , ’ mrs @entity39 , 57 , of @entity40 , @entity41 , said yesterday			1
@entity39 says she taught her pets to sit on the stairlift by giving them treats each time they did it properly hold on tight ! the @entity48 ' dachshunds are now a dab paw at sitting still on the lift as it carries them up and down ‘ when the company we bought it from rang up a few weeks ago to see how we were getting on with it , they were flabbergasted when i told them it was for the dogs			2
' i bet they thought that i ’d lost my marbles			0
‘ dachshunds often develop back problems and they were struggling to get up the steep steps into our bedroom , which is where they ’ve always slept			0
’ she and her husband , who used to run his own brewery , trained the dogs to sit on the lift seat by rewarding them with treats every time they used it correctly			0
@entity39 , right with her pets , also uses a child 's pram , left , to take her ailing dachshund @entity17 for a walk mrs @entity39 , a mother of four , said : ‘ they soon began to enjoy the trips and they happily jump on the seat at bedtime , then take a ride downstairs in the morning			1
’ the dogs , adopted five years ago from @entity92 , where she volunteers , are too heavy for her to carry upstairs			0
‘ the stairlift cost a fraction of the spine operation – and we might need to use it ourselves in a few years , ’ mrs @entity39 added			0
treasured trio : the much - loved dachshunds @entity17 , @entity22 and @entity24 pose for the camera back on terra firm			1

@entity17 the long - *haired* dachshund had back pain after a £ 5,000 spine op
owners @entity12 and @entity13 of @entity40 , @entity41 say money well spent
@entity17 's dachshund *friends* @entity24 and @entity22 go too - all *bribed* with treats
