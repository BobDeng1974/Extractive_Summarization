a smartphone that sells for a tenth of the cost of a new @entity3 is to go on sale in @entity5 next month			1
budget technology firm @entity6 , which has taken the @entity8 market by storm , is introducing a range of phones that sell for as little as £ 60			1
the cheapest , the @entity12 , comes with a 3.5 - inch screen , a @entity15 megapixel camera and runs on @entity16 4.2			1
the cheapest , called @entity21 , pictured , comes with a 3.5 - inch touchscreen , @entity24 camera and runs @entity16 4.2 @entity16 screen : 3.5 - inch operating system : @entity27 4.2 camera : @entity24 rear - facing , vga front - facing storage : @entity32 with @entity34 sd card slot processor : dual - core @entity36 @entity38 : € 70 - the equivalent of just under £ 60 available in five colours and is dual sim available in five colours , it currently retails at € 70 - the equivalent of just under £ 60			1
@entity5 has been slow to take advantage of plummeting technology costs which are making smartphones affordable across @entity46 and @entity47			2
budget firms in @entity49 and elsewhere are taking basic smartphone chips and circuits , putting a cheap case , screen and camera on them , and selling them online			2
two years ago @entity55 introduced the same idea to the @entity8 - and last year nearly 7 per cent of @entity8 first - time smartphone buyers bought a @entity6 phone			1
@entity59 of consumer research firm @entity60 said smartphone technology has been cheap for several years , but @entity63 nations including @entity5 are only just waking up to the potential			1
she said : ‘ about seven years ago manufacturers in @entity49 started teaming up with chip makers			0
they took the standard workings of a smartphone and made huge numbers at low cost			0
‘ they then attach a screen , a case and a camera and take it to market at low cost			2
‘ so far they have been focusing on emerging markets , mainly @entity46 and @entity47 , but now they are beginning to look closely at mature markets			0
’ the key , she said , is keeping costs low			0
budget firms in @entity49 and elsewhere are taking basic smartphone chips and circuits , putting a cheap case , screen and camera on them , and selling them online			2
two years ago @entity55 introduced the same idea to @entity8 market - and last year nearly 7 per cent of @entity8 first - time smartphone buyers bought a @entity6 phone , pictured although the @entity21 phone , pictured , comes with just @entity32 storage , it has a @entity94 slot			1
in addition to the rear - facing camera , the phone also has a vga camera on the front of the device while giants such as @entity105 and @entity106 spend millions on research and development , marketing and sales , most of the emerging budget firms sell their phones online			1
‘ the margins are very tight , ’ she said			0
‘ these firms have to have the right strategy and that will usually involve online sales			0
’ a few years ago the latest smartphone was the most technologically advanced device anyone could own - and consumers were prepared to pay a premium for it			0
but now buyers have turned their attention to tablets and ‘ wearable ’ technologies such as smartwatches - and want to spend less on their phones			0
the @entity6 will go up against the budget phone released by network operator @entity130 last month , called @entity131			1
@entity130 's 4.5 - inch branded @entity133 phone , manufactured by @entity134 , costs £ 99.99 , runs on @entity136 4.3 , comes with a @entity139 rear - facing camera and has a @entity141 processor			1
it is also available for free on a two - year contract that costs £ 13.99 a month			1
@entity144 recently unveiled a range of budget handsets in its @entity148 range			0
the 630 ( pictured ) has the same screen size , camera and processing power as the @entity131 , but prices have not yet been announced			0
the 635 is almost identical to the 630 , but crucially supports @entity153 , another budget brand taking @entity155 by storm is @entity157 , set up by former @entity159 employees			0
its smallest model is the @entity162 which has a 3.5 - inch screen , @entity165 dual - core processor , @entity166 of @entity167 and a @entity15 rear - facing camera			1
the camera on the front is @entity172			0
like the @entity21 , the @entity162 is dual - @entity173 and has @entity174 of storage , with a @entity176 microsd card slot			2
a @entity5 release date for the @entity179 range has not been announced but the phones can be bought from @entity181 starting at £ 89			2
the plummeting cost of making phones means that buyers are getting more for their money			0
in 2012 , 42 per cent of phones priced at less than £ 50 had a processor faster than 1 gigahertz - by last year 87 per cent did			0
the cheapest phones may become cheaper still			0
non-profit firm @entity189 announced in february it is developing a smartphones that it could sell for only £ 15			0
@entity191 , global strategic insight director at @entity60 , said cheap phones may not have as big an impact on the @entity5 market as they have elsewhere			0
@entity6 's @entity12 will go up against budget handset @entity131 , pictured			1
@entity130 's 4.5 - inch branded @entity133 phone , manufactured by @entity134 , costs £ 99.99 , runs on @entity136 4.3 , comes with a @entity139 rear - facing camera and has a @entity203 processor			1
it is free on a £ 13.99 - a - month contract another budget brand taking @entity155 by storm is @entity157			2
its smallest model - the trooper x3.5 - pictured right , has a 3.5 - inch screen and @entity24 camera			1
like the @entity12 , the trooper is dual - sim and has expandable storage			1
a @entity5 release date for the @entity179 range , pictured , has n't been announced but prices on @entity181 start at £ 89 most smartphone buyers tend to take out long contracts , he said , so the upfront cost is low			2
people rarely pay the full £ 500 to £ 700 for a top - of - the range @entity3 , because the cost is absorbed into the £ 40 to £ 50 they pay in their monthly service charge			0
@entity191 said : ‘ this @entity6 phone is the cheapest to hit the @entity5 market and it will undoubtedly do well			1
‘ but in @entity8 , where it has been very well received , there is a different situation			0
the @entity8 market does not tend to subsidise the upfront cost of a phone as much as in @entity5			1
‘ so while the pay - as - you - go market in @entity5 will be affected by this range , the contract market is unlikely to be as affected			2

@entity6 's @entity237 ' phone retails at € 70 - the equivalent of around £ 60
the @entity8 firm is set to *launch* the device in the @entity5 from next month
it has a 3.5 - inch screen , @entity24 camera and runs @entity136 4.2
although @entity12 comes with just @entity32 storage , it has a @entity94 slot
