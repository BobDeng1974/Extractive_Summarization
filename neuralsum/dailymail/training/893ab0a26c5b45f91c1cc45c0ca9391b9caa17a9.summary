a mother has warned the medication she takes for her depression has ruined her ability to orgasm – and is now speaking publicly about her experiences of getting it back			1
@entity8 blogger @entity7 switched antidepressants last year and discovered she was unable to reach climax through masturbation			1
experts warn that a delay in the ability to orgasm is a common side - effect of many antidepressants , faced by up to half the people who take them			1
@entity7 , a mother - of - three , is now sharing intimate details of her sex life online in order to raise awareness to the side effects of antidepressants			1
around half of all antidepressant users experience this effect , an expert has said @entity7 has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder , generalised anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder ( @entity36 )			1
over the years she has tried various treatments including supplements , diets , lifestyle behaviours and the most widely prescribed antidepressants known @entity42 ( @entity42 )			0
last year she switched antidepressants and began taking amitriptyline , an older antidepressant which is no longer used as a first - line treatment			1
it is thought to block the effects of two chemical messengers called serotonin and norepinephrine , regulating mood and controlling depression			2
but writing on her blog , @entity7 says while the medication allows her to ' feel alive for the first time ' , she began to experience side effects such as sleepiness , a dry mouth and the inability to orgasm			1
she found ways to cope with the dry mouth and sleepiness , but found the lack of orgasm – or anorgasmia , as it is known medically – a bigger problem			0
she said on her blog : ' after an @entity69 [ contraceptive coil ] installation and starting medications for fibromyalgia and an antidepressant , my orgasm disappeared briefly			1
' at the time of recording , with partnered sex i was missing my explosive orgasm			1
@entity80 - the inability to orgasm - is a known side effect of some antidepressants			1
@entity7 has blogged about her experiences of anorgasmia , and wants to raise awareness to this side effect ' while those waves were nice , they were nothing close to the restorative experience i so depend on for a mental , emotional and physical recharge			1
' ‘ a few weeks later i can blissfully report that universe creating powerhouse orgasms have returned via partnered sex			0
‘ the bad news is that orgasm via masturbation is still gone			0
’ she has started a project called # @entity103 , in which she aims to achieve one self - induced orgasm a day , with the hope of regaining her ability to climax through masturbation long term			0
she tweets updates of whether she has been able to achieve orgasm , to break down stigma			0
for example : in her first # @entity103 blog post she describes how being able to orgasm on her own has always helped her battle her depression			2
she said : ' masturbating is my zen			0
it ’s almost my religion			0
masturbation is part of my identity , a part that i am not about to give up on			0
‘ my high sex drive and orgasmic superpower have been the most dependable parts of my identity			0
' @entity127 has been my go - to pick me up for combating depression , allowing myself to feel something other than the darkness			0
' @entity80 , or the inability to orgasm , is a common side effect of antidepressants			1
it is not completely clear why some people experience anorgasmia while taking the drugs			2
@entity138 , professor of psychopharmacology at @entity140 , said that in certain antidepressants , the same mechanism that regulates mood delays the time it takes for a person to orgasm			1
he told @entity148 : ' a number of antidepressants affect the way serotonin is made in the body ' @entity154 is a neurotransmitter - it takes a message from one nerve cell to another			2
' so boosting its effects are able to treat depression			2
but it also delays time to orgasm			2
' he explained that the neurotransmitters cling to nerve cells , one of which receptors is involved in orgasm			0
' if you stimulate that serotonin receptor , it helps treat depression but it also delays the time to achieve climax , ' he said			2
' there 's a drug of the same pharmacology that is marketed as a drug for premature ejaculation			0
' however , he added that one of the characteristics of depression is sexual dysfunction , therefore when people lose their ability to orgasm it is difficult to tell if it is due to depression or the antidepressant			1
@entity80 as a side effect of antidepressants is extremely common , @entity138 , professor of psychopharmacology at @entity140 , told @entity148			1

in the @entity214 , recent government figures revealed more than 50 million prescriptions for antidepressants were issued in @entity217 last year			1
a 2013 study by the @entity219 found 4 million people in the @entity214 take @entity42			2
@entity7 says she has already tried a wide range of treatments for depression , and does not want to stop taking amitriptyline			1
writing on her blog , she said : ' the anorgasmia is not enough to make me want to get off this medication or try another , as i believe that i can work through and return to some sort of orgasmic state			0
my libido has not been affected			0
' she wants to raise awareness to this problem as there is a stigma associated with discussing sexuality in public			0
this means means many people taking antidepressants might suffer in silence , she says			2
' when people bring up that their medication is hurting their sex life , most people seem to experience a complete dismissal that sexuality changes are important , ' she told the @entity250			1
' while my doctor spoke to me in depth about it , the stories i get from hundreds of other people are horrific			0

antidepressants are a type of medication used to treat depression or prevent it recurring			2
they can also be used to prevent obsessive - compulsive disorder ( @entity333 ) , generalised anxiety disorder ( @entity335 ) and post-traumatic stress disorder ( @entity36 )			2
it is thought antidepressants work by increasing levels of a group of chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters			0
certain neurotransmitters , such as serotonin and noradrenaline , can improve mood and emotion , although this process is not fully understood			0
increasing levels of neurotransmitters can also disrupt pain signals sent by nerves , which may explain why some antidepressants can help relieve long - term pain			0
