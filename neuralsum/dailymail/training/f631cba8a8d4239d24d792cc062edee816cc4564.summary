the @entity0 has warned that @entity1 could be facing one of its wettest winters ever , amid claims the conditions are perfect for a series of powerful @entity8 storms			1
after a mild october , much of the country has been subjected to heavy rainfall in recent days , with some localised flooding , particularly in the south west - a region among the worst hit by last year 's winter floods			1
and the latest three - month outlook from the @entity0 , which covers november to january , suggests that the next three months will be wetter than average , with weather fronts coming in from the @entity8 , bringing stormy conditions			1
it is caused when warmer air from over the @entity33 meets colder air from the @entity35 @entity36 morning : @entity38 planes can be seen through the fog this morning at @entity40 ' the outlook suggests the continuing risk of our weather coming in from the @entity8 , which brings unsettled conditions , during the first part of the three - month period , ' the outlook states			1
and while the @entity0 experts suggest that more unsettled conditions are typical for autumn , the outlook says ' spells of wet and windy weather may be more frequent than is typical '			1
last year 's winter was the wettest ever on record , with the @entity1 hit by 486.8mm of rain between december and february , narrowly above the previous record of 485.1mm set in 1995			1
temperatures are likely to be milder than average for the first part of the outlook , although colder weather is predicted for january , with the outlook adding : ' the risk of occasional colder outbreaks increases later in the period '			1
fog : parts of the south east got off to a foggy start this morning , with some rain forecast for later @entity71 feel : boats moored on the @entity73 in @entity74 , @entity75 , this morning into the mist : a cyclist crosses the bridge between @entity80 and @entity81 lakes in @entity74 forecast : the start of the week will be unsettled , with rain forecast for monday , but tuesday will be drier researchers have suggested that the jet stream , which carries weather systems to the @entity1 from across the @entity8 has become stronger , bringing sea temperatures and windspeeds which could lead to a particularly wet winter			1
@entity91 , professor of applied mathematics at the @entity0 , who specialises in modelling longer - term weather and climate patterns , said : ' the rainfall over the last few weeks has already been well above average			1
' these storms are generated by the jet stream which also carries them eastwards towards us			0
the jet stream has recently got stronger and moved north , which could carry weather systems from the @entity8 right over the @entity1			1
' last friday saw @entity106 hit by winds of 93mph , @entity105 struck by 75mph gales and @entity110 suffering widespread flooding			0
singing in the rain : people gather under umbrellas to watch the orchestra perform at the @entity116 today wrapped up warm : a mother and her daughter don their waterproofs and wellies to stay dry in @entity116 the outlook 's summary suggests that the probability that precipitation during the november to january period will fall into the wettest category is around 25 percent , although this comes with the caveat that the probability of it being in the driest category is 15 percent			2
jet streams , which can reach speeds of 200mph , are caused by the temperature difference between tropical air masses and polar air masses and steer weather patterns around the globe			0
an increased difference in temperature between the cold @entity143 region and the warm @entity33 ocean current and rising wind speed with altitude above the two stretches of water could also lead to storms in the @entity1			0
cooler temperatures : people take an afternoon walk along the shoreline at @entity154 , @entity155 , despite the dropping temperatures beside the seaside : although the weather has turned cooler , the beach was still a popular place to be today enjoying the view : a couple take time to sit and watch the sea , despite the dark clouds swirling overhead the potential for these factors to combine , generating @entity1 - bound storms is so great that professor @entity169 and his colleagues are promoting a new term - ' baroclinicity ' - to describe it			1
the word could even be incorporated into tv forecasts			0
prof @entity169 added : ' it 's a word we might need to get used to - it means we are likely to get more wet and windy weather			2
' in the more immediate future , the @entity0 forecast for the next month predicts that the west of the country is most likely to see heavier rain and stronger winds , with frost more likely after next weekend			1
walking the dog : these dog walkers took advantage of a break from the rain to stretch their legs sporting chance : a group of friends swapped wellies for shorts for a spot of beach volleyball in @entity198 determined : even a spot of rain could not stop this pair from visiting @entity198 beach this afternoon after weekend showers the @entity0 told motorists to be wary of the conditions and warned of localised flooding nationwide			2
they forecast a ' grey and miserable ' rush hour tomorrow morning in the @entity209 and east , with most of the @entity1 soaked later			0
fronts originating in the @entity8 will dump 10 - 20mm of rain in the @entity212 and @entity213 on wednesday , moving to the @entity212 and @entity214 on thursday , and followed by further rain plus gales on friday and again during the weekend in the @entity213 and @entity214 , with the @entity217 drier but still seeing showers at times			1
chaos : workmen fixing a pothole on the @entity221 , which opened up on friday morning after bad weather hit @entity223 in @entity224 @entity0 forecaster @entity225 said : ' it will be a grey , miserable start on monday , with an unsettled week ahead , windy at times			2
' parts are saturated and more prone to impacts such as localised water issues			0
' warnings have not issued but that may change , so people should monitor warnings			0
' a system pushing in through monday means rain will be falling in the morning rush hour			0
people should definitely be aware of the conditions			0
' monday ’s rain will affect much of the @entity1 , with heavier bursts and possibly persistent , particularly in the @entity241 , with 45mph wind gusts			0
' an @entity8 band of rain comes in on tuesday night into wednesday , with 10 - 20mm falling			2
' low pressure arriving later on thursday will affect the @entity212 and @entity213 , with the weekend seeing a front likely to come in from the @entity8 and move across parts of @entity1 , wettest in the @entity213 with the @entity217 drier			2
' places have been wetter than average in the past week and unsettled weather is expected to continue to the start of december			0
' we ’ll be able to see how this year might fare compared to previous years when we get the november rainfall statistics at the end of the month			0
' torrential rain overnight caused floods in some parts of @entity106 , where several properties in the seaside town of @entity259 suffered flooding and electrical failure as heavy rain lashed the region from 10pm onwards			2
four people had to be rescued from their car trapped in floodwater in the town , while another driver also had to freed after his car was caught in floodwater at nearby @entity271 near @entity272 just before midnight .			0

after a mild october much of the country has been hit by heavy rain
@entity0 three - month outlook suggests more wet weather is to come
weather fronts coming from the @entity8 will bring stormy conditions to @entity1
