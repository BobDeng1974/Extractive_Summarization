@entity0 illustrated the magnitude of the task that lies ahead for @entity3 against the @entity4 on saturday when he compared it to facing @entity5 in his pomp			1
a contest against the world champions at @entity9 inevitably has a flavour of the @entity11 about it			1
@entity3 after all have never beaten the @entity4 - two draws over the generations is all we can muster			1
yet there is a mood of optimism in the @entity3 camp this week - buoyed as the players are by their sparkling performance in the 41 - 31 win over @entity21 at the weekend			1
@entity0 ( right ) compared playing @entity4 to facing @entity5 at tennis @entity0 ( right ) said @entity23 have to show grit and determination against the @entity4 and there was a steely determination about @entity0 yesterday as he talked passionately about his desire to go down in history as the first @entity3 skipper to lead his nation to a win over the mighty @entity4			1
‘ we are n’t going to die wondering , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we are going to chuck the ball about when it is on , tighten up when we have to			2
we are going to try and play the @entity36 way			2
it ’s about grit and determination first and foremost and getting stuck in			2
if we do that and set our stall out we give ourselves a good chance			0
‘ for us this game i suppose is like playing @entity5 at tennis			1
it is taking on the best team , the best competitors the sport has			0
the @entity4 have shown that over a number of years			1
they have consistently been the best team in the world			0
@entity52 ( left ) of @entity3 is tackled by @entity21 's @entity53 during saturday 's match ‘ that is a credit to them and their values and the way they play their game			1
when they play in the black jersey they are an incredible outfit			0
when we go out to face them on saturday it will be the ultimate test for the players and the ultimate test for us as a @entity3 team			1
we ca n’t go out there as individuals			0
we need to be collective and fight for each other			0
’ the 29 - year - old @entity0 has been on the receiving end of two heavy home defeats at the hands of the @entity4 , making his debut off the bench in a 49 - 3 defeat in 2010 and starting in the 51 - 22 mauling two years later			1
the one big lesson learned from both games was the need to keep the @entity4 on a tight leash early on or risk the game being lost before it has really begun			1
‘ that seems to be the pattern for many of their games , which is why we need to try and start well , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ we need to stay in the game for 20 minutes , 40 minutes , 60 and feel our way through the game			0
@entity93 scores a try during the @entity94 against @entity21 @entity93 wildly celebrates his try as @entity3 ran out 41 - 31 winners against @entity21 ‘ we need to play with ball in hand as much as we can because if we have the ball it is easier to play the game rather than us trying to chase it down and defending			2
you get a lot more tired defending so we need to stay competitive and taking the game to them			0
‘ i think we lost 13 tries in the two games i played against them so we have to drastically reduce that number if we are going to come anywhere near them			0
’ the victory over @entity21 last weekend , or at least the first 60 minutes of the match when @entity3 dominated and led 34 - 10 , has given @entity0 confidence that history can be written on saturday			1
‘ you have to think we can go out there and win and be part of the first @entity3 team to beat @entity4 , ’ he said			1
‘ we all know the challenge we face and if we are going to @entity121 celebrates scoring a late try in the second half and is congratulated by @entity93 and @entity124 get anywhere near them we need an 80 minute performance that ’s for sure			0
‘ the fact we won that @entity21 game was great for us but because we let in a couple of tries near the end means we still have our feet firmly on the ground			0
we are not getting carried away			0
‘ we need to be very disciplined this weekend and not get the yellow cards we picked up against @entity21			0
to get even close to @entity4 we need to keep 15 men on the field			2
’ although @entity0 is only @entity3 captain on a game - by - game basis with first - choice skipper @entity141 being ruled out with a broken arm , he has gained the trust of head coach , and @entity145 , @entity146			1
@entity0 ( left ) runs with the ball during @entity3 's win over @entity21 on saturday @entity0 believes that inside knowledge of @entity4 will give the @entity3 players a vital insight into how to approach the game mentally			1
‘ obviously @entity146 has a strong @entity154 background which is good for us , ’ he continued			0
‘ he has n’t really been involved in the @entity4 set up , but he ’s from @entity4 , he knows what they are all about , he knows the cultures and the way that they like to play the game and what goes through their minds			2
‘ that has been good for us , me especially , because i have been speaking to @entity146 to get an understanding as to what they are all about			0
‘ it ’s clear to see the @entity4 have a great attitude every time they play the game			2
in close games they always seem to come out on top and that is not just not by coincidence			0
they are strong mentally and maybe @entity146 can give us an insight into the @entity4 way of thinking			2
‘ @entity176 is one word we wo n’t be using this week but it would be fantastic to win and we are going out there with that in mind			0
we know we need to play with pride and passion but whatever happens we are really going to give it a shot			0
’ @entity121 dives in to score a try during the test win over @entity21 on saturday			2
