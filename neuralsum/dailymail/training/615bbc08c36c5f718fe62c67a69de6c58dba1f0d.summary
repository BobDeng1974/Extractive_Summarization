hosting a soiree this @entity1 ? start with @entity2 , move on to gin or vodka , toast 2015 in with @entity6 and round the celebrations off with a classic @entity8			1
but avoid beer , red wine and shots if you want to last the night and still be liked by your friends the morning after			1
‘ if you ’re having dinner first , a lovely festive twist on the most classic of aperitifs , is the @entity31 , ’ @entity19 , owner of @entity22 restaurant and cocktail bar in @entity23 advises			1
‘ this version ( recipe below ) omits the gin , which you might want to save for later in the evening , and replaces it with @entity2 or @entity6			2
‘ even if you ’re not having dinner , this is a safe drink to kick the night off that wo n’t get you too inebriated early on in the evening			2
‘ to continue the evening , i ’d stick to long drinks for now			2
otherwise come midnight , you ’ll be the one sleeping it off in the corner while your friends ring in the @entity43			2
' and while a @entity45 may not be the most adventurous of drinks , it will help you keep the pace			2
a clean , classic and cold drink like a @entity8 is the perfect way to end a @entity1 problems and solutions : overindulged in the @entity51 ( left ) ? make things better with a @entity25 ( right ) ‘ sticking to the clear sprits will save you a world of pain the morning after			1
g&ts or @entity58 are a safe bet			2
' they may not be exciting but they ’ll help you play the long game			0
add some angostura bitters to jazz up a @entity45			0
’ more complicated cocktails , he said , are best saved for the later part of the evening			0
‘ my go to cocktail is always the @entity51 ( recipe below ) , simple , super tasty and very drinkable or for something with a fizz , @entity67 ( recipe below ) is a punchy but tasty combination of vodka , elderflower and @entity2 or @entity6			1
’ at midnight , mr @entity19 recommends opting for bubbly made only with @entity76 grapes			1
‘ come the stroke of midnight , @entity6 is obligatory , ’ he said			0
‘ what you drink will be based on your budget , but i find a decent @entity81 made with only @entity76 grapes - to be preferable on a long evening rather than the very dry brut @entity6 , which tend to dry out your mouth , giving you " @entity6 breath " , which is not a sexy as it sounds , and always lead to a killer hangover			1
’ and while the natural choice to end the night would be a good scotch or an old fashioned , he advises steering clear of darker spirits			1
‘ it ’s entirely up to you , ’ he said , ‘ but remember the darker spirits are the ones that hurt more the day after , and if the night is still young , these will send you off too early			1
’ ‘ go for a classic @entity8 ( recipe below ) if you 're looking for something with a bit more kick			0
clean , classic and cold			0
