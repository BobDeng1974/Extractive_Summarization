a 100 million - year - old plant has been ‘ caught in the act ’ after being encased in amber during pollination			0
the hardened tree sap preserved a cluster of 18 tiny flowers from the @entity7 with one of them in the process of making some new seeds for the next generation			1
the scene is thought to be the oldest evidence of sexual reproduction ever found in a flowering plant			2
a 100 - million - year old piece of amber has been discovered which reveals the oldest evidence of sexual reproduction in a flowering plant			0
the perfectly - preserved scene , in a plant now extinct , is part of a portrait created in the mid-cretaceous when flowering plants were changing the face of the @entity28 forever named @entity29 , the plant is made of bunches of very tiny flowers around a millimetre wide			1
the discovery was made from amber mines in the @entity36 of @entity37 , previously known as @entity37			0
it is a newly discovered species , and so different from anything researchers have seen before that it does n't seem to have any modern - day relatives			0
according to researchers , the scene appears identical to the reproduction process that ‘ angiosperms , ’ or flowering plants still use today			1
the pollen tubes penetrating the stigma on this ancient flower are the only known fossil of this type , showing the process of sexual reproduction in a flowering plant the @entity7 started 125 million years ago and ended with the extinction of the dinosaurs			1
prior to that , it was a warm period with no ice caps at the poles			0
much of what we now know as dry land was underwater			0
the now extinct plant dates from the mid-cretaceous when flowering plants were changing the face of the @entity28 , adding beauty , biodiversity and food			1
the newly - described genus and species of flower was named @entity29			0
the plant is made of bunches of very tiny flowers around a millimetre wide			1
much of the plant life during this period was composed of conifers , ferns , mosses , and cycads but new lineages of mammals and birds were beginning to appear , along with the flowering plants			1

the flower cluster is one of the most complete ever found in amber and appeared at a time when many of the flowering plants were still quite small			1
scientists were able to capture a microscopic image of pollen tubes growing out of two grains of pollen and penetrating the flower 's stigma , the receptive part of the female reproductive system			0
this sets the stage for fertilisation of the egg and would begin the process of seed formation - had the reproductive act been completed			0
‘ in @entity7 flowers we 've never before seen a fossil that shows the pollen tube actually entering the stigma , ’ said professor @entity118 at @entity119			2
the discovery was made from amber mines in the @entity36 of @entity37 , previously known as @entity37 ‘ this is the beauty of amber fossils			0
they are preserved so rapidly after entering the resin that structures such as pollen grains and tubes can be detected with a microscope			2
’ professor @entity118 added that the pollen appeared to be sticky suggesting it was carried by a pollinating insect adding further insights into the biodiversity and biology of life in this distant era			2
‘ the evolution of flowering plants caused an enormous change in the biodiversity of life on @entity28 , especially in the tropics and subtropics , ’ he said			1
‘ new associations between these small flowering plants and various types of insects and other animal life resulted in the successful distribution and evolution of these plants through most of the world today			2
‘ it 's interesting that the mechanisms for reproduction that are still with us today had already been established some 100 million years ago			0

microscope images reveal one of the flowers was in process of pollination
scene dates to a period when dinosaurs were alive and flowering plants were changing the face of the @entity28 , adding beauty , biodiversity and food
