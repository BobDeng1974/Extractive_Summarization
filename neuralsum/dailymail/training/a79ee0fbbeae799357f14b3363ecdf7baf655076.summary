sipping cappuccinos by the pool of the striking @entity4 hotel in @entity5 last summer , @entity0 could n’t wait to get back to work			1
his voice was crackling with excitement			2
it was there , during a break between matches at the @entity13 in @entity14 , when he admitted that the performances of @entity17 and @entity18 had whetted his appetite for the game once more			2
just three months have passed since he returned to start pre-season training with his new club @entity22			2
he will be wondering whether it is all worth it			0
@entity0 is no longer a first choice at @entity22 after making a slow start to life after @entity28 the former @entity30 captain had decided to continue his career despite leaving @entity32 last summer nearly 36 , @entity0 is no longer first choice in the @entity35 team and has just been banned by the @entity36 for three games , fined £ 25,000 and ordered to attend an education course			1
when he left @entity28 last season , he could have pursued a promising broadcasting career with @entity41 and the @entity42 , or branched out into fashion and retail with his # 5 clothing and magazine range			2
instead he wanted one more season on the field , driving into @entity22 ’s rough and ready @entity50 training ground each day from his enormous family home in @entity52 to smell the dressing - room atmosphere once again			2
@entity0 recently released another autobiography , # 2sides , which included criticism of the management techniques used by @entity58 in his short spell as @entity28 manager			1
a few days after its release , along with the subsequent publicity around the farrago over @entity58 ’ decision to ban chips , @entity0 was in the @entity22 team beaten 4 - 0 at @entity28			1
@entity0 could have bowed out of @entity69 football at the top , but wanted one more season the @entity22 defender was part of the @entity42 's @entity13 coverage in @entity14 last summer @entity0 has also worked as a pundit for @entity76 , but chose another season playing over a media career still , he was given a tremendous reception , with chants of ‘ @entity81 ’ ringing around the stands when he walked out with his new team just before kick - off			1
he won six @entity69 titles , the @entity86 and the @entity87 during his glittering career at the @entity32			0
this season has turned into a nightmare			0
there are very few players who have left @entity32 in the autumn of their careers and gone on to be a success at their next club			0
when the legs went , @entity97 ( twice ) , @entity98 and @entity99 , who all enjoyed stellar careers at @entity28 , went out at the very top			2
others , such as @entity103 ( @entity104 ) , @entity105 ( @entity106 ) , @entity107 ( @entity108 ) , and @entity109 ( @entity110 ) , had limited success after they were shown the door by sir @entity113			0
@entity103 , in his recently - released book @entity116 , admits he should never have moved to @entity117 after @entity113 kicked him out of @entity32 in 2005			0
@entity0 won 81 @entity30 caps , and was named captain by @entity120 before the 2010 @entity13 few players have continued to achieve success after leaving @entity32 and @entity0 is struggling @entity0 ’s great friend @entity123 , now 36 , is enjoying a remarkable loan spell with @entity125 and was voted the fans ' player of the month in september			1
no - one , though , really wants to admit that they are done with football at the very highest level			0
the former @entity30 international wanted to work with @entity132 , the man who gave him his first - team debut at @entity134 in 1996 , for one more season before he called it quits			1
it has not gone so well			0
he has been nailed by the @entity36 this week , taken to the cleaners for using the word ‘ sket ’ — street - slang for a promiscuous woman — in a foolish exchange on @entity144			0
@entity0 , a prominent and respected member of the football community , ought to have known better than to react , but @entity144 is the wild west ; provocation and abuse are rife			2
he should be a statesman of the game , a beacon for every budding young player trying to make their way into professional football			0
@entity0 six @entity69 titles , the @entity86 and the @entity156 while at @entity28 on monday evening , when he sat on the substitutes ’ bench for the second successive @entity22 match at @entity161 , it was sad to see one of the game ’s great players looking on			1
it must have been a tough decision for @entity132 to leave him out of the team to face @entity167 , a game they lost 3 - 2 , but @entity0 accepted the decision			1
naturally , he did n’t agree with it			0
after @entity22 ’s 2 - 0 victory over @entity172 on monday , @entity132 revealed that @entity0 had admitted he had ‘ never been so nervous during a game ’ and was highly animated throughout			1
@entity132 went on to say that @entity0 , who admitted in an interview with this newspaper in september that he wanted to become @entity30 ’s head coach , will go on to become a top - class manager			1
the defender sits behind his manager @entity132 , who believes @entity0 will make an excellent coach @entity0 is a veteran of social media , and should have been able to ignore the provocation that is all in the future , but the priority is to win back his place in the @entity22 team when his three - match suspension is over			1
he has seven days to lodge an appeal over the punishment , but as it stands he will miss games against @entity194 ( saturday ) , @entity125 ( november 8 ) and @entity195 ( november 22 )			0
there were days when @entity0 , one of the great modern - day defenders , would relish the prospect of facing those three teams in a @entity28 shirt			1
instead he will be sitting in the stands			0
after the career he ’s had , this is no way to go out			0
having lost his place in the @entity22 starting line - up , @entity0 has now been banned for three games			1
