for the first time ever , the @entity1 government is acknowledging the existence of the enigmatic military base in the southern @entity6 desert famously known as @entity7			1
but its purpose , according to recently released documents , is far less spectacular than most @entity11 enthusiasts would have hoped			0
the @entity12 at @entity13 recently published a report entitled ' @entity15 of the @entity16			0
' it chronicles the history and importance of the spy planes that were frequently used during the @entity21			1
in their research for the report , the @entity12 the researchers obtained declassified documents about the planes that actually reference @entity7 on several occasions - as well as a map of the secret base			1
the documents were obtained through a @entity32 request made in 2005			0
it does exist ! for the first time ever , the @entity1 government acknowledges that @entity7 exists @entity7 typically is associated with governmental secrecy , particularly in terms of ufos and extra terrestrials			2
conspiracy theorists often claim that a downed alien spacecraft is being held and studied in the facility , based more on the fact that the government has - until now - never acknowledged that the base exists and kept the goings on inside its walls a secret than actual , documented facts			2
of the many @entity11 theories , conspiracy buffs also believe the site was used to - among other things - hold meetings with extraterrestrial life forms , design exotic energy weapons , develop means for weather control , develop time travel and host meetings of the shadowy majestic 12 one world government organization			2
in developing the u- 2 , the government needed a secret - and reliable - test facility somewhere in the @entity1			1
on april 12 , 1955 , scouts were flying over the @entity6 desert when they spotted @entity67 , according to ' the @entity68 and @entity69 , ' an internal @entity68 history of the u- 2 program written by @entity72 and @entity73 that was declassified when the @entity12 submitted their @entity32 request			1
secretive : in 1955 , the @entity1 government needed a secret place to test the u- 2 spy plane the @entity68 chose @entity67 in @entity6 and brought the first u- 2s there in july of 1955 @entity21 : the @entity16 played enormous role in the @entity21 and flew countless missions over the @entity81 and @entity82 ' on 12 april 1955 , @entity84 and col. @entity85 ( the senior @entity88 officer on the project staff ) flew over @entity6 with @entity90 on a small @entity92 plane piloted by @entity94 ’s chief test pilot , @entity93 , ' the document reads			1
' they spotted what appeared to be an airstrip by a salt flat known as @entity67 , near the northeast corner of the @entity100 ’s ( @entity100 ) @entity101			0
' the men agreed that @entity67 was the perfect spot for the new , top - secret base , and asked the @entity100 to add it to its real estate holdings in @entity6			1
conspiracy : @entity11 junkies believe the government is hiding a crashed alien spacecraft at @entity7 the @entity110 : scouts looking for a place to test the @entity16 decided @entity67 - later @entity7 - was the perfect spot ' president @entity115 also approved the addition of this strip of wasteland , known by its map designation as @entity7 , to the @entity101 , ' the history continues			1
' the outlines of @entity7 are shown on current unclassified maps as a small rectangular area adjoining the northeast corner of the much larger @entity101			0
to make the new facility in the middle of nowhere sound more attractive to his workers , @entity90 called it the @entity7 , which was soon shortened to the ranch			0
' the first planes were delivered to @entity7 on july 25 , 1955 , and the trials began two days later			2
the first documented test flight occurred on august 4 , 1955			0
the employees who worked at the base actually were flown in from @entity134 , @entity135 on monday mornings and returned on friday afternoons , beginning on october 3 , 1955			0
the @entity88 took over the base when the @entity68 was done with it in 1957 , and continued using it as a training ground for @entity16 2 pilots			2
the new declassified documents do n't reveal any earth - shattering details , but as @entity141 , a senior fellow with the @entity12 who found the documents , points out , ' it marks an end of official secrecy about the facts of @entity7 ' it opens up the possibility that future accounts of this and other aerial projects will be less redacted , more fully explained in terms of their presence in @entity7 , ” he tells the @entity156 @entity155			0

the government says @entity7 was developed so the @entity68 could test @entity21 - era u- 2 spy planes
on april 12 , 1955 , scouts were flying over the @entity6 desert looking for a test spot for the u- 2 when they spotted @entity67
president @entity115 approved the plan to build the secret base at @entity67
