more than £ 12million was paid out in legal costs and compensation to asylum seekers and other immigrants last year , figures have showed			1
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) paid a total of £ 14.2million last year in compensation , legal costs and ex gratia payments , up almost £ 2million on the previous year , the agency 's annual report for 2010/11 showed			1
this included payments to families who were unlawfully detained and removed , as well as £ 175,000 in compensation to an asylum seeker who was unlawfully detained and injured while in custody			1
the @entity17 told @entity18 today that the money which is intended for frontline services when given by hard - pressed tax - payers is instead being ' wasted on compensation payments			1
' bordering on the expensive : @entity9 's annual report showed @entity24 paid a total of £ 14.2million last year to asylum seekers and immigrants legal costs alone topped £ 7.7million in just over 1,000 cases , compared with £ 3.8million for 691 cases in 2009/10			1
more than £ 4million was also paid out in 152 cases where each individual compensation payment was less than £ 250,000			1
this compared with 837 such cases in 2009/10 which led to £ 4.4million in compensation being paid			1
the @entity9 report also said the agency had ' various legal claims which are currently outstanding ' and had set aside £ 4million , ' based on past experience ' , for ' a number of cases of unlawful detention '			2
the @entity17 today criticised the huge outlay as a ' waste '			1
' taxpayers should n’t be paying out millions every year for compensation claims , said @entity47 of the @entity17			1
legal ruling : failed asylum seekers won the right to claim damages after a @entity52 in january over three young children held at @entity55 immigration detention centre ' whether it is the result of the @entity9 ’s failure to manage chaotic border controls , or dubious cases in @entity61 courts where compensation is n’t really called for			2
' either way , action is needed to get costs under control so that money intended for frontline services from hard - pressed taxpayers is n’t wasted on compensation payments			1
' a @entity9 spokeswoman said : ' detention is a necessary part of the process to remove some individuals with no right to be here			2
at work : the @entity9 says it detains people when it believes it is reasonable and lawful to do so ' ' cases vary from foreign national prisoners who have served their sentences but are awaiting deportation , to failed asylum cases and individuals found overstaying their visas			2
' we use our powers to detain individuals when we believe it is reasonable and lawful to do so and regularly review the system			2
' in january , failed asylum seekers won the right to claim damages which could run into thousands of pounds after the @entity52 ruled that three young children were held at an immigration detention centre unlawfully			0
the ruling was a legal victory for the mothers - @entity99 , 37 , a @entity101 nurse , and @entity102 , 25 , a @entity104 national - who brought the legal challenge			0
both said a lack of safeguards at @entity55 in @entity109 , the @entity24 's main removal centre for women and minors , led to their children suffering distress and trauma			0
mr justice @entity116 , sitting in @entity117 , ruled that the government 's current policy on detaining families with children pending deportation was not unlawful , but - in the cases being considered - it had not been applied by the @entity9 ' with the rigour it deserves '			0
as a result , ' the claimants were detained unlawfully from the time they were taken into custody until their release ' and they were entitled to claim damages			0
the judge said : ' the cases of the two families involved in this litigation provide good examples of the failure by @entity9 to apply important aspects of the policy , both when the decisions were taken to detain each family and when decisions were taken to maintain detention after removal directions had been cancelled			0
' human rights act : key compensation payments to victims were made under the families ' rights to private and family life , and their right to liberty the judge declared that the families ' rights to private and family life under @entity156 had been breached , along with their @entity157 5 right to liberty			0
but he rejected claims that their right not to be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment had been infringed			0
both mothers were failed asylum seekers arrested by @entity9 officers in dawn raids on their homes last february			0
they were taken to @entity55 for removal back to their country of origin on the basis that they had no right to remain in the @entity24			0
ms @entity99 and her two boys , aged one and 11 , were detained for 17 days , while ms @entity102 and her two - year - old daughter were held for 12 days before being released and allowed back into the community pending their legal challenges .			0

@entity17 says the money is being ' wasted '
