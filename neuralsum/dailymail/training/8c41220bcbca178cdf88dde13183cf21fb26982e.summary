by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 crash , bang , wallop what a picture ! at least it will be for @entity7 boss @entity6			1
he may have been bulked up with thermal layers in preparation for the humidity of @entity11 but there was no disguising the fact that @entity14 looks lean and fresh			1
@entity14 was brimming with energy as he slammed into rugby - style tackling pads at @entity17 in a full contact physical drill organised by @entity20 fitness coach @entity19 , who is in @entity6 's backroom team for these @entity23 finals			1
it 's football , not rugby ! @entity14 is given a beating during strength work at @entity7 training showing his strength : @entity14 runs into the crash bag held by coach @entity19 hotting up : @entity14 and the rest of the @entity7 squad trained in plenty of layers to replicate the heat in @entity11 @entity19 worked with @entity14 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , challenging the four strikers to muscle their way past the giant rubber pads before collecting a pass and firing at goal			1
@entity6 had split his outfield players into positional groups for this part of the morning session and the @entity7 boss would have been delighted to see the glint in @entity14 's eye			1
the @entity20 star missed the end of the season with a groin problem and took fitness and conditioning experts with him on holiday at the end of the campaign , determined to stay in shape after disappointments at his two previous @entity23 tournaments			2
in 2006 , he recovered from a broken metatarsal but lacked sharpness and erupted with a red card during @entity7 's quarter - final defeat against @entity68			2
four years ago he was also suffering niggling problems and fitness issues which limited his work in training			0
@entity6 will hope this time it is different for @entity14 and is sure to be encouraged by the evidence since his squad assembled last week			2
take a break : @entity14 has a drink during the gruelling training session struggle : @entity14 was not fully fit for the last @entity23 in @entity81 and it showed in his performance @entity84 revealed that players had been shedding more than a kilogram in each training session as they piled on extra clothing in preparation for the heat of the @entity92 rainforest , where they will play @entity93 on june 14			1
' we 've all got three or four layers on , ' said @entity84			0
' we 've been told to weigh in before and after training			0
people are losing anything from a kilo to two kilos of sweat and that is going to be pretty much the case over there			0
' we need to get used to playing in those conditions and hydrating properly as well			0
training was quite difficult but at the same time enjoyable and it is quite exciting at the moment			0

@entity7 stars put through their paces with @entity112 style drills
@entity14 fighting fit and ready to shine in @entity11
@entity14 has not been fully fit at previous tournaments
