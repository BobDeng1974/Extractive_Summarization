by @entity0 published : 12:16 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 12:35 est , 27 january 2014 a blind mechanic has told how he still fix cars - purely by feel and the sound of the engine			2
@entity7 , 45 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , lost his sight after setting up a business in his 20s			1
but instead of letting the rare and debilitating condition , called scotomas , prevent him from doing the job he loved , mr @entity7 relied on his other senses			1
sense : blind mechanic @entity7 relies on touch and feel to find the problem the father - of - two described the horror of waking up one morning when he was 24 to discover his eyesight was failing			2
mr @entity7 told @entity23 : ' i woke up one morning and the eye that had the spot in it was completely black			2
' i could n't see anything out of it			0
and then the other eye was starting to have issues and that was very scary			0
' the rare degenerative disease - which leaves sufferers with large dark patches of vision - has robbed mr @entity7 of much of his vision now			1
inspiring : @entity7 , 45 , lost his sight when he was 24 but the condition did not prevent him from continuing as a mechanic adapting to adversity : @entity7 has specially adapted tools to enable him to find it quickly when he is under a car bonnet but he has developed new skills and techniques which enable him to solve almost any mechanical problem with which he is presented			1
he listens to the sound of the engine and feels parts to determine what fault needs repairing			0
and his condition has not deterred any customers from using his car repair business			0
@entity7 said : ' if i look right at you i do n't see anything			2
i have what they call central scotomas , where i ca n't see anything			0
vocation : mr @entity7 , of @entity8 , @entity9 , was named after the 1958 motorcar and loved to fix vehicles from a young age ' if i look to the side a little bit i can see kind of a blurred , like an old grainy television and some of your outline , but i do n't see any details			1
' mr @entity7 , whose father and grandmother were mechanics , was born to work with cars - and was even named after a 1958 @entity79 car , widely recognised as one of the worst cars made			1
he grew up on his family 's gas station in @entity84 and it appears the mechanical bent is in the genes			0
both his sons have followed in their father 's footsteps and become car mechanics .			0
