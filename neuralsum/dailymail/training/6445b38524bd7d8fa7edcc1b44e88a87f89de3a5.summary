@entity0 has gone ballistic ... again			1
this time it 's because producers of @entity4 , backed by @entity5 , want to draw in a younger audience and to that end add flash sales to the mix and finally fill the fifth seat - with a much younger host , a show insider tells @entity12			1
@entity4 is desperately trying to find younger viewers			1
hosted by @entity5 , 58 , @entity0 , 52 , @entity14 , 42 , and @entity15 , 50 , the show is drawing in a much older @entity18 - friendly audience			1
@entity20 executives are intent on making changes in an effort to attract viewers in the 18 - to - 34 demographic , an age group coveted by advertisers			2
currently , @entity4 is being crushed in the 18 - to - 34 demo group by both the @entity29 ( in first place ) and new talk show @entity27 ( in second )			1
they never thought @entity27 would beat them out in key demographics and now they have to do something to make the show more youthful , which is hard when the average age of your co-host is 50 , ' a source at the network told @entity12			0
a popular trend with younger tv viewers on all talk shows is the flash sale segment , offering exclusive bargains to viewers			2
the @entity29 , the talk and @entity64 all regularly do segments where they announce on tv that the audience can buy an item at a super low price from the show 's website for a limited time			2
@entity4 did a version of this segment last summer that was popular with viewers			1
but when @entity5 announced yesterday that they would be doing the segment next monday , dubbing it the ' @entity76 , ' a shocked @entity0 expressed concern on live tv			1
' i did n't know we were doing that			0
that makes us like the home shopping club , what is that ? ' she asked			1
status quo : her sweatshirt logo notwithstanding			0
@entity0 's not happy with the way things are shaking out numero uni : @entity92 is grabbing a much younger audience in the all - important younger demographic and in second place : the talk stars ( from left ) @entity97 , @entity98 , guest @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 are also reaching more younger viewers than @entity4 @entity5 replied : ' it 's something that allows us to keep changing our set			1
' @entity0 shot back : ' i did n't enjoy those , but maybe it â€™s just me			1
keep going , ' and then went into an uncomfortable giggle			0
at the end of the show in the production meeting , @entity0 went nuclear			1
' why did n't someone tell me about this segment ? who in the hell approved that concept ? ' i hated it on the previous version of the show			0
i wo n't stand for this crap , ' she yelled at producers , who sat and took their scolding			0
the executive producer attempted to explain to an irate @entity0 that the concept tests well with other shows and younger viewers love it			1
that made her explode even more			0
' do n't give me that bull * * * t , ' she screamed			0
' stop trying to change this show to get younger viewers			0
this is not what i signed up for			0
' @entity20 has already begun quietly scouting for a fifth co-host to join the panel - a younger personality under 35 who has a strong social media following and a definitive voice			2
the original format for @entity4 centered around five co-hosts and network executives feel now is the time to bring that back			2
go with the flow : @entity5 seems large and in charge at @entity4 these days talks of them adding a fifth new co-host as soon as january has also upset @entity0 , who wants the show to go an entire year without a fifth person			1
' @entity0 has made it clear she 's not happy about the network looking for a fifth co-host			2
she hates the idea that they are trying to be competitive with the younger audience and thinks they should cater to the people who are currently watching the show , ' says the source			1
@entity4 has had two changes to the set since their september 15 premiere show			1
two weeks ago , they finally ditched the loveseats and low table that viewers dogged on social media			0
they added brown velvet chairs and a higher table , though co-host @entity175 complained ' it still was n't quite high enough			0
' @entity5 even griped on air about hitting her knees on the table			2
on monday , the show unveiled their second more drastic overhaul to the set			1
gone is the all - white studio that research showed ' made the show feel old ' and now they have added blue , yellow and orange panels with matching lighting to the stage and a multicolored backdrop on the jumbo screen behind their desk			0
they 've also stopped the walking from the back of studio in @entity199 - like fashion and now enter on stage behind their desk			0
' the set change and new entrance was done to make the show look and feel younger			2
they 're trying anything now to appeal to a youthful demo			0
only time will tell if it works , ' offered the source .			0

@entity0 went ballistic when she learned @entity4 will be *selling* *discounted* merchandise to draw in a younger audience
' that makes us like the home shopping club , ' she *blasted* @entity5
@entity4 has also put out a casting call for a fifth host : only *millennials* need apply
a new set , unveiled monday , is also aimed at drawing younger view - ers
