when a man wants to spend the rest of his life with a woman , he often extends an offer to her to become part of his family			0

the adoption papers state that @entity12 , now a legal child of @entity8 , is immediately entitled to at least a third of his trust			1
@entity8 and ms @entity12 began dating in 2009 , according to her testimony			1
@entity46 ’ attorney , @entity45 , told the @entity34 that @entity8 is attempting to use the adoption to shield his assets			1
‘ it can not go unrecognised that ( @entity8 ) chose to adopt his 42 - year - old adult girlfriend as opposed to a needy child , ' he told the paper			1
judge @entity53 wrote that the events are taking the court ‘ into a legal twilight zone			0
’ the trial : @entity8 's lawyer said in court that the adoption has nothing to do with his pending criminal trial wreckage : @entity8 is charged with driving while intoxicated and vehicular manslaughter after police reports show he ran a stop sign and slammed into @entity15 's @entity66 , right ms @entity37 agreed			1
‘ unless you intend to create the parent - child relationship , you are violating the letter of the law , ’ she told @entity35			2

his family sold the business in 2004 for a reported $ 1.4 billion			0
he converted his father ’s horse farm into a polo ranch and later began building his empire			2
his club became a magnate for the rich and famous , entertaining the likes of @entity117 and princess @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , and @entity121			0
even @entity122 was spotted at the club , attending an @entity9 match in 2009			2
@entity8 ’s wealth is a point of a heated dispute			1
the @entity128 questioned the heir ’s true assets , quoting mr @entity15 ’s lawyer			1
attorney @entity132 said @entity8 is much richer than his financial documents show			2
he is seeking punitive damages that will ‘ sting ( @entity8 ) badly without bankrupting him , ’ mr @entity132 told the @entity128			2

the financial battle has been closely tied to the wrongful death suit			0
in 2002 , the mogul sold his @entity24 estate to his children ’s trust fund for $ 3.8million , according to the @entity128			0
but he only rents it for $ 2,000 per month			0

lap of luxury : the @entity9 attracts a-list celebrities home sweet home : @entity8 sold his @entity24 mansion to his children 's trust for $ 3.8million and now pays $ 2,000/month rent in a 2006 document , @entity8 claimed one of his trusts was worth more than $ 100 million			1
mr @entity132 pointed out that @entity8 claimed in 2011 that trust was only worth $ 6.9 million			2
the @entity46 have already settled privately with the @entity177 , a bar in @entity24 where @entity8 had been drinking in february 2010			1

in the april 2009 divorce filing , ms @entity183 said she was fearful for the safety of herself as well as her children			2
@entity188 , a fellow of the @entity189 , has been practicing adoption law for nearly 30 years			0
she told @entity191 that while nothing illegal was done when @entity8 adopted his girlfriend , she ’s seen many cases where adoption ‘ is used for purposes other than what you ’d traditionally think it was intended			1
’ in @entity25 , adult adoptions do not have the same requirements as traditional child adoptions			0
she explained : ‘ a lot of the traditional adoption statutes - including home studies – those protections are eliminated when you ’re adopting an adult , with less government intrusion being the goal			0
’ she said the only people who have to consent in an adult adoption are the adoptee and the adopter			0
under @entity25 law , they do have to give notice of the adoption , though ms @entity188 notes that parental consent is not required			0
‘ the court may not have been aware of many things , ’ she said , ‘ including that there was a pending wrongful death suit , or that she was a girlfriend			2
’ when asked if is now legal for @entity8 to have sex with his daughter , ms @entity188 responded : ‘ that ’s a good question			2
i ’m not a criminal lawyer , but it ’s a solid question to wonder about			0
’ she said that because they ’re both adults and not biologically related , the question ’s answer is murky			0
‘ creepy , ’ she said , ’ but i do n’t know if that ’s illegal			0
’ attorney @entity234 told @entity191 that under @entity25 law , the statutory has no law against having sex with an adopted child as long as there is no lineal consanguinity - meaning there is no close blood tie , such as aunt , uncle , niece , or nephew			2
ms @entity188 said that should @entity8 wish to marry ms @entity12 after the criminal case , it would be a difficult endeavour			1
the statute , she said , is permanent in the eyes of the law			0
‘ even for fraud of duress , you have to bring the challenges in front of the court			0
’ in @entity25 , all adoption papers are sealed and can not be viewed by reporters or third parties			0
‘ a court could order the file open , ’ ms @entity188 said , ’ but it is difficult to do ’ – in most cases because of the sensitive nature of protecting identities			0
ms @entity12 could in theory , with the consent of @entity8 , be re-adopted by her parents and then marry him , ms @entity269 ’s civil case , ms @entity188 said the court could open the adoption file and examine if there was any fraud on the court or the adoptee ( ms @entity12 )			1
she added : ‘ there ’s nothing illegal , per se , about adopting your girlfriend			0
