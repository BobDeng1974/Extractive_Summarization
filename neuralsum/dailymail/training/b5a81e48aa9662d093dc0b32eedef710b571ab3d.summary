resurrecting a prehistoric creature might seem like a sci - fi dream , but scientists say they have taken a step towards cloning the extinct woolly mammoth and there is a ' high chance ' it will happen			1
experts expect to extract ‘ high quality dna ’ from a 43,000 year old carcass found in @entity10			1
the announcement follows the autopsy on the female mammoth found last year in permafrost in @entity17 's diamond region of the @entity18 , which is also known as @entity18			1
the researchers expect test results on blood ( pictured ) extracted from the woolly mammoth to give the genetic material needed to attempt to clone the animal ‘ there was palpable excitement among the team which included scientists from @entity17 , the @entity30 , the @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , ’ @entity25 reported			1
the researchers expect test results on blood extracted from the woolly mammoth to provide the genetic material needed to attempt to clone the animal			1
woolly mammoths finally died out in eastern @entity10 around 4,000 years ago			1
@entity40 , vice president of the @entity17 @entity41 , said : ‘ the data we are about to receive will give us a high chance to clone the mammoth			1
’ but he called for responsibility in bringing the ancient beast back to life , urging that competing teams seeking to win a race to clone the mammoth , not to play @entity52 for the sake of it			2

they performed an autopsy on the female mammoth ( pictured ) focusing on its liver			2
the frozen beast was found last year in permafrost in @entity17 's diamond region of the @entity18 , which is also known as @entity18 the mammoth 's liver ( pictured ) is very well preserved and the researchers said that it looks like there are some solid fragments inside it			1
they have n't got round to studying them yet , but they think they might be kidney stones ‘ we must have a reason to do this , as it is one thing to clone it for scientific purpose and another to clone for the sake of curiosity , ’ he said			0
a cloning attempt would involve a female elephant – the closest living relative of the mammoth - acting as a surrogate mother			2
@entity86 , chief of the @entity87 of @entity88 , said : ‘ we have dissected the soft tissues of the mammoth - and i must say that we did n't expect such results			2
‘ the carcass that is more than 43,000 years old has preserved better than a body of a human buried for six months			1
the scientists found the liver intact on the mammoth ( pictured ) , which the mammoth was discovered in may 2013 on @entity98 in @entity10			1
it is thought that the animal died an unnatural death and spent many hours in agony ‘ the tissue cut clearly shows blood vessels with strong walls			2
inside the vessels there is haemolysed blood where for the first time we have found erythrocytes [ red blood cells ]			0
muscle and adipose tissues [ body fat ] are well preserved , ’ she added			0
the scientists found the liver intact on the mammoth , which was discovered in may 2013 on @entity98 in @entity10			1
its trunk is also in excellent condition			0
mr @entity40 said : ‘ the mammoth died an unnatural death , ’ explaining this was detectable from the blood			2
the researchers said that tissue shows blood vessels with strong walls			0
inside the vessels there is haemolysed blood and muscle and adipose tissues are well preserved the scientists found the liver intact ( pictured ) in the mammoth			2
its trunk is also in excellent condition			0
here , one expert measures a lump in the animal 's organ , which is thought to be a kidney stone ‘ it died in agony which lasted for about 16 to 18 hours , ’ he said			0
‘ this is also confirmed by the position of the body , with its back leg stretched in an unnatural way			0
' we think this was a female mammoth that fell into an ice hole from which she could n't escape			0
’ originally , after the mammoth 's discovery , it was believed the creature was about 10,000 years old			0
but recent analysis has put her age at 43,000 years			2
the mammoth disappeared from @entity10 at the end of the @entity164 period some 10,000 years ago in circumstances that are a matter of scientific debate			1
climate change and hunting by humans may have been factors			0
an isolated population of the creature survived on @entity174 in the @entity175 until around 4,000 years ago			1
the announcement follows the autopsy on the female mammoth found last year in permafrost in @entity98 ( pictured ) in @entity17 's diamond region of the @entity18 , which is also known as @entity18 the scientists said they did not expect to see the soft tissues of the mammoth ( pictured ) in such good condition and believe there is a ' high chance ' the creature could be cloned scientists from a number of @entity17 and @entity31 institutions carried out a full anatomic necropsy , which involves removing and describing every organ as well as conducting microbiological and genetic tests and looking for parasites , on the ancient bision an ancient bison was discovered in july 2011 in a remote part of @entity17 , but scientists are only now performing an autopsy in the hope that vital scientific information about the extinction of some bison species around 9,000 years ago will be revealed			1
the autopsy is thought to be the first in the world on such an old bison and scientists will now look for parasites that might have plagued the animals			0
the creature was found perfectly preserved in july 2011 in the @entity18 , also known as @entity18 , on the shore of a lake in the north of @entity214 - @entity213 district , where woolly mammoth remains have previously been found			1
' the discovery has an enormous value for scientists since it is the best preserved bison ever found , ’ said @entity219 , chief of the @entity220 of the @entity221			0
experts are carrying out a full anatomic autopsy , which involves removing and describing every organ as well as conducting microbiological and genetic tests and looking for parasites			0
@entity31 scientists have long been studying bison living in @entity228 and hope to compare them to the animal ’s @entity230 relatives			0
the scientists hope to map a model of an ancient pasture by studying remains of the foods in the bison 's digestive organs and to publish their research next year			0
dr @entity219 said that histology samples – the samples showing the microscopic anatomy of cells and tissues of the animal - will prove the most interesting , as they will be the first chance scientists have to studying parasites attached to ancient bison .			0

experts believe there is a ' high chance ' that cloning is possible having performed an autopsy on a woolly mammoth
the prehistoric beast was found in the permafrost of the @entity18 , otherwise known as @entity18 in @entity10 and its body is 43,000 years old
researchers expect test results on blood extracted from the woolly mammoth to give genetic material needed to attempt to clone the animal
woolly mammoths died out in eastern @entity10 around 4,000 years ago
