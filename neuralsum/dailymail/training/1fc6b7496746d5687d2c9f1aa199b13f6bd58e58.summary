by @entity0 and @entity1 furious : charities are angry @entity4 is planning to cap tax relief on donations charities went to war with @entity9 last night after wealthy donors were branded tax dodgers			1
no 10 said many are giving money to bogus charities , some of them abroad , to claim income tax relief and wipe out their liabilities			1
but furious charities said the accusations – for which @entity9 has produced no evidence – were a desperate attempt to justify @entity4 ’s plan to cap tax relief on donations			1
more than 800 charities , including @entity26 and @entity27 , have signed up to a campaign called ‘ @entity32 ’ to persuade the chancellor to drop his plans , outlined in the @entity31			1
they warned that the cap , set at 25 per cent of a donor ’s income if he or she is giving more than £ 50,000 , will hurt already struggling charities			1
last night dame @entity40 , who has given away £ 60million herself , accused the government of ‘ a cack - handed assault on philanthropic giving ’			2
@entity44 , who runs a group called @entity46 , said the charity sector would lose ‘ hundreds of millions of pounds ’ a year			0
in an open letter to @entity49 , she said : ‘ these plans are already discouraging major giving , with donors informing charities privately of their intention to put on hold plans to give five - , six - or even seven - figure sums			2
‘ they will , if enacted , significantly hamper the work of many charities , large and small , as almost half of all giving comes from just 7 per cent of donors			2
’ the government ’s claims that there is a widespread problem with the wealthy funnelling cash to bogus charities was quickly shot down by the @entity68			1
the watchdog , which registers charities and investigates claims of wrongdoing , said it had never been contacted by the @entity73 about the issue			0
@entity26 is one of 800 charities which has backed a ' give it back @entity79 ' campaign the ‘ charity tax ’ is the latest public relations disaster to hit the government as a result of the @entity31 , following the unpopular ‘ granny tax ’ to freeze tax allowances for pensioners and the ‘ pasty tax ’ to put @entity87 on hot snacks			1
@entity49 's official spokesman accused major charitable donors of ' exploiting ' the system to pay less tax the chancellor went on the attack yesterday , saying he was ‘ shocked to see that some of the very wealthiest people in the country had organised their tax affairs so that they were regularly paying virtually no income tax			1
’ @entity49 ’s official spokesman then accused major charitable donors of ‘ exploiting ’ the system to pay less in tax than the average family			0
‘ in certain instances they may be giving to charities and those charities do n’t , in all cases , do a great deal of charitable work , ’ the spokesman said			2
government officials said the chancellor had been shown examples by @entity116 officials of wealthy people who have thrown lavish ‘ footballers ’ wives ’ style parties and then claimed that they were charitable fundraisers to get tax relief			1
taxpayers may claim relief on donations made to any charity based in the @entity127			0
but charities and critics said that if the government wants to stamp out abuse it should close loopholes rather than impose a blanket cap that will hurt some of @entity135 ’s best - loved charities			2
@entity136 , chief executive of the @entity137 , said : ‘ philanthropists who make large donations give away far , far more than they could ever claim in tax relief			1
‘ we should recognise and celebrate them , not brand them wealthy tax dodgers			0
’ the foundation said the biggest 100 donors , who will be hit hardest by the plans , handed over £ 1.67billion last year , an average of £ 17million each			0
charities , including @entity149 , claim they will suffer under the cap , which will leave them struggling to survive @entity152 , director of @entity154 charity @entity153 , said : ‘ mr @entity4 is using a sledgehammer to crack an over-exaggerated nut			0
‘ it can not make sense to punish the vast majority of honest charities and philanthropists for the supposed actions of a minority			0
‘ it is insulting for the @entity73 to brand @entity135 ’s many great charitable givers tax avoiders			0
we hope the chancellor will listen to reason and rethink this ill - judged , ill - designed tax			0
’ laws introduced only last year already crack down on ‘ tainted donors ’ , tycoons who funnel money into charitable trusts that ultimately benefit them			0
another law imposed a ‘ fit and proper test ’ , meaning that if a donor wants to claim tax relief for a charity abroad , it has to be rubber - stamped as a genuine charity by the @entity135 authorities			1
@entity183 , chairman of @entity184 , which advises charities on tax , said : ‘ if this cap has been designed to tackle abuse , i ’m surprised they do n’t feel comfortable with the legislation they have only recently implemented			2
’ the @entity73 has promised to discuss how to minimise the effects of the plan on charities			0
more than 800 charities have put their names to the @entity79 campaign but treasury minister @entity198 held meetings with charities last week and sources said he ‘ did not budge one inch ’			1
a @entity73 spokesman said : ‘ reliefs exist for good reason but it is not right that wealthy individuals can use them without limit to reduce their income tax bills to close to zero , often year after year			0
‘ there will still be tax relief for donations to charity			1
‘ we remain committed to supporting philanthropy , which is why we are proactively exploring with philanthropists ways to ensure this new limit will not significantly impact upon charities that depend on large donations			0
