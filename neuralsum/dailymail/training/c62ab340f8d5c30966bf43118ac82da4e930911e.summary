an elephant who was brought to tears after being held in chains and beaten for more than 50 years has finally been declared free from his former abusive owners			1
@entity6 was left bleeding from spiked shackles and living on hand - outs from passing tourists after he was captured and tied up by his ' owner '			1
the majestic animal had been forced to hold out his trunk and beg for coins from passers - by – surviving only on plastic and paper for food in the @entity19 area of @entity20			1
but , after 50 years of torture , the animal cried tears of relief after he was rescued by a wildlife charity in a daring midnight operation – fittingly on @entity42			1
however , last month the elephant 's future was left hanging in the balance after his former owners launched a legal battle to reclaim him after insisting he was their ' rightful property '			1
but last night after a series of hearings , an @entity20 court ruled that @entity6 must stay with his rescuers from the @entity53 charity @entity52			1
founder of the charity @entity56 , who led the daring , midnight rescue to save @entity6 said : ' we are beyond overjoyed that @entity6 is finally saved			1
' this is a huge victory , not only for @entity6 , but for every elephant suffering in pain silently			2
in the court in @entity20 , @entity52 lawyers argued an elephant can not be owned by someone under @entity20 law as they are all owned by the government founder of the @entity52 charity @entity56 said it was unthinkable that @entity6 may have had to be returned to his former life ' elephants are majestic , intelligent animals , who are proven to grieve and feel emotion – so for an elephant to suffer for 50 years in chains , as @entity6 has , is truly barbaric			1
' when his former owners launched a legal bid to get him back it was unthinkable that he could return to the life he 'd had begging on the streets in shackles			1
' we were determined to fight for him to ensure he could live out his days free from beatings and harm and we 've had many a sleepless night worrying about what the future held for him			0
' he had been so terribly brutalised for 50 years that we feared he 'd be unable to live with his own kind			1
he did n't even know how to be an elephant			0
but now he 's joined our herd of rescued @entity20 elephants it 's like he 's always been with them			2
' in the court in @entity20 , @entity52 lawyers argued an elephant can not be owned by someone under @entity20 law as they are all owned by the government			1
they successfully argued that only a license issued from the chief wildlife warden is proof of ownership			0
the legal team of @entity6 's former owners were unable to produce documents to show that they were the certified owners of the elephant wildlife experts believe that @entity6 was poached from his mother as a young calf before being sold on and treated as a commodity when the legal team of @entity6 's previous owner were unable to produce a certificate the case was dismissed			1
@entity52 executive director @entity114 explained : ' this meant that @entity6 was finally truly free and there is no chance he will be returned to the shackles that chained him for 50 years			1
' it was completely outrageous to us that two months after we 'd cut his chains his freedom was threatened			0
' he had just started to settle into his new home with our charity , making friends and learning to trust people			0
' it was too cruel to contemplate that this was under threat			0
' although we always hoped we would win this case because we all love @entity6 we could n't help but feel profound anxiety over what was happening			2
now , finally his future is secure			0
' the court case followed the rescue of @entity6 by the @entity137 - based charity who had stepped in to save the elephant from dying in his bonds			1
mr @entity56 added : ' like all of the elephants we have rescued , we believe @entity6 was poached from the his mother as a young calf			2
a 10 - strong team of vets and wildlife experts were joined by 20 forestry department officers and six policemen to seize @entity6 from his suffering in july the head vet from the charity @entity52 dr @entity153 had the job of freeing @entity6 from his chains he was discovered have been held in chains which had left him bleeding from spiked shackles and was forced to beg for food from passing tourists ' the poachers either slaughter the mother , or they drive the herd into traps that are small enough only for the babies to fall into			1
the mother cries for her baby for days after he 's been stolen – it is a sickening trade			0
' the calves are then tied and beaten until they submit to their owners – their spirits are effectively broken			0
' @entity6 's case was particularly tragic			2
he 'd been poached as a calf and then he has been sold on and sold on			0
incredibly we believe he has had up to 27 owners – he 's been treated as a commodity every two years of his life			2
the moment that @entity6 was finally freed from his chains , wildlife experts said that tears rolled down his face as he began to cry a delighted @entity6 appears to smile after enjoying his first meal after being freed			1
the charity believes that the elephant had a total of 27 owners after being poached as a calf ' by the time we found him in july 2013 he was in a pathetic condition			2
he had no shelter for him at night , and was being used as a prop to beg from dawn until dusk from tourists visiting the sites of @entity20			2
' he had n't been fed properly and tourists started giving him sweet food items and because he was in a state of hunger and exhaustion he began eating plastic and paper			0
' it took us 45 minutes to remove the shackles that had torn into the flesh on his legs for the past 50 years – and act of unthinkable cruelty			1
and it was when he was finally freed that tears gushed down his face			2
i 'd never seen anything like it in my life			0
' his legs were so covered in absesses and his feet so damaged by walking on hard tarmac roads , that we have spent £ 40,000 so far on his medical treatment , and we still have a long way to go as he has a serious limp and open wounds			0
' pain and brutality were all he knew			0
his cruel handler even tore out the hair from his tail to sell as good luck charms			0
the exploitation and abuse just had to stop			0
' now the charity has launched a @entity233 campaign to save the last 67 performing circus elephants in @entity20 to join the charity 's herd of hope			1
the charity has so far spent £ 40,000 on the elephant 's medical treatment so far and he is still suffering from open wounds and a serious limp after his release , @entity6 was taken to wildlife @entity52 's sanctuary			1
the organisation is also planning to rescue another elephant from its abusive owner mr @entity56 added : ' @entity6 and our herd of hope are the lucky ones			1
but there are 67 performing elephants in @entity20 – many of which suffer daily beatings in order to make them perform			2
' we 're already planning our next rescue – the desperate case of a blind elephant who is forced to perform even though she ca n't see for crowds			0
it 's a pitiful case and we need to free her so she can join @entity6			0
' now the public can help him live out a dignified life in peace with even a small donation , ' @entity56 said @entity56 , whose charity is dependent on public donations			0
' all these elephants have known from human beings is pain and suffering – now we 're asking to help us help him live out their days , with grass under their feet – free from humiliation and pain			0
' to donate see @entity281 to @entity52 .			0
