as @entity2 and @entity3 ’s royal tour to @entity4 draws near , interest in the minute details of their schedule , childcare plans , and of course @entity2 ’s wardrobe is reaching fever pitch			1
a worldwide fashion icon , the @entity13 ’s wardrobe will be under even more scrutiny than usual as she embarks on her second official royal tour , seen by millions as an ambassador for @entity20 fashion			0
as well as no doubt remaining loyal to some of her long standing favourite designers such as , @entity25 , the 32 - year - old has apparently also commissioned @entity27 to design some of her pieces for the trip			2
@entity2 , pictured performing her royal duties recently , has reportedly turned to @entity27 for help with her hot anticipated wardrobe for the upcoming tour the trip to @entity4 , which starts next week , marks the second official tour the @entity13 and @entity2 have undertaken on behalf of the @entity37 , and interest is high worldwide , especially as they will be joined by @entity40 looking through the @entity43 collection it is not hard to image @entity2 in many of the elegant designs @entity47 and @entity48 are the @entity4 couple behind the @entity20 brand @entity51 reports that a source confirms @entity2 has approached the designers , saying : ‘ @entity2 visited @entity27 ’s boutique last month and said she was looking for inspiration for the tour			1
‘ she liked that they had @entity4 connections and has apparently given them specific instructions for a gown			0
’ the brand , which hit the news earlier this year when they became the first @entity20 designer ever to be welcomed into the official @entity67 in over 100 years , is sure to be a crowd pleasing choice for her upcoming tour down under , @entity27 , despite being a @entity20 brand , was founded in 2007 by @entity4 couple @entity47 and @entity48			2
and @entity2 will be in good company as the pair boast some serious a list clientele including @entity74 and @entity75 , and their outfits have price - tags to match with a cocktail dress looking through the latest collection it is not hard to imagine @entity2 looking elegant in a number of their pieces , which included tailored skirt suits with @entity2 ’s favoured cinched - in waist and breath - taking red carpet worthy gowns			0
however the commissioning of the designers marks a distinct change in direction for the @entity2 , who is known for her love of high - street designers			2
@entity27 were the first @entity20 designer to be officially part of @entity67 for 100 years the designers have yet to make a ready - to - wear range and a bespoke gown can cost as much as £ 50,000 @entity99 , pictured here in 2012 at the third stop of the couple 's nine - day tour of @entity104 and the @entity105 , kept her look casual , wearing lots of high street brands as well as designer clothes the @entity37 is apparently is keen to see @entity2 looking more regal on the upcoming tour , with longer hemlines and more jewels			1
@entity3 and @entity2 ’s 2012 tour of @entity104 saw @entity2 pairing @entity20 designers such as @entity115 with plenty of high street favourites such as @entity118 and @entity119			1
in contrast to her usual humble fashion tastes , @entity27 represent the very top end of design , having never in fact produced a ready - to - wear range , focusing instead on custom made pieces and couture collections			1
speaking to @entity131 earlier this year @entity130 said of their ethos : ‘ we create an experience around the dress ; we have a very personal relationship with each of our clients			0
‘ i have always loved the fantasy or fashion and it was important for me to focus on something i loved			0
’ the move up the fashion ladder may be prompted by the @entity37 , who apparently is keen to see @entity2 looking more regal on the upcoming tour , with longer hemlines and more jewels .			0
