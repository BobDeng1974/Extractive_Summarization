by @entity0 last updated at 7:44 pm on 14th december 2011 the @entity2 ’s ex-legal manager today insisted that he told @entity3 there was ' direct and hard evidence ' that phone hacking extended beyond a single reporter in 2008			1
@entity8 said he showed the @entity10 chief a printout of the now - notorious ' for @entity13 ' email at a meeting also attended by the paper ’s then - editor @entity15			1
the email , which contained transcripts of illegally intercepted voicemail messages , apparently showed that hacking went beyond a single rogue reporter			1
email claims : @entity8 , pictured giving evidence to the @entity25 inquiry yesterday , today said he showed @entity3 in 2008 there was evidence phone hacking went beyond a single rogue reporter mr @entity8 told the @entity30 that he had shown mr @entity3 a number of documents which included the ' for @entity13 ' message during the meeting on june 10 , 2008			1
' i can not remember whether they were passed across the table to him , but i am pretty sure i held up the front page of the email , ' he said			2
' i am also pretty sure that he already knew about it - in terms of it had been described to him already , which i think the other documents that have come out suggest anyway			2
' @entity46 , the @entity2 ’s former royal editor , was jailed along with private investigator @entity48 in january 2007 after they admitted intercepting voicemail messages left on royal aides ’ phones			0
claims : @entity3 was shown evidence that phone hacking was more widespread than just one reporter , @entity8 said yesterday the inquiry was told mr @entity3 was sent emails which revealed that phone - hacking was ‘ rife ’ at the @entity2 in 2008			1
mr @entity15 forwarded the executive an email exchange and added the note : ‘ unfortunately it is as bad as we feared ’			2
today mr @entity8 said : ' what was certainly discussed was the email - not described as for @entity13 , but the damning email - and what it meant in terms of further involvement in phone hacking beyond @entity46 and @entity48			1
' and what was relayed to mr @entity3 was that this document clearly was direct and hard evidence of that being the case			1
' mr @entity3 has insisted that he was not shown the email or told that it proved phone hacking was more widespread at the @entity2 than previously thought			1
the crucial ' for @entity13 ' message is thought to have been intended for @entity80 , the paper 's chief reporter			1
the meeting with mr @entity3 had been arranged to discuss a claim brought by @entity84 ’ @entity87 chief executive @entity86 over the hacking of his phone by the @entity2 , the inquiry heard			1
@entity90 editor @entity15 arrives at the @entity30 today mr @entity8 said he only ' temporarily ' breathed a sigh of relief when the case was settled , adding : ' i was expecting another claim , frankly			0
' explaining why the paper ’s publishers agreed to pay mr @entity86 £ 425,000 plus costs , the lawyer said the company wanted to protect its reputation and reduce the likelihood of further expensive litigation			2
@entity104 , counsel to the inquiry , asked him : ' this might also be interpreted as , to use a blanket term , a culture of cover - up			2
would you accept that ? ' mr @entity8 replied : ' no , i do n’t think i would			0
it ’s a culture of avoiding reputational damage through bad publicity , but it certainly is n’t a culture of cover - up if the damning documents are in the police ’s possession and in fact came from the police			0
' mr @entity8 also said he understood a representative of @entity125 ’s family gave the @entity2 permission to publish the personal diary of the missing girl ’s mother			1
@entity130 told the inquiry last month that she felt ' violated ' and like ' climbing into a hole and not coming out ' when the intensely private journal appeared in the paper on september 14 , 2008			1
mr @entity8 said today : ' my understanding was that the representative of the @entity137 had given the ok , the permission to the head of the newsdesk at the @entity2 , to run the diaries or extracts from the diaries			1
i think he had emails to support that			0
' mr @entity146 said : ' i have seen some documents which on one interpretation of them broadly support what you are saying			0
' separately , appearing before the inquiry today , former @entity2 editor @entity15 said he ' did not recognise ' much of the evidence given by @entity155 , the paper 's ex-deputy features editor			0
mr @entity155 told the hearing last month that phone hacking was in the public interest , claimed celebrities often ' loved ' being chased by journalists , and argued that ' privacy is for paedos '			2
mr @entity15 said today : ' the criminality that took place , if it did take place , at the @entity2 , is one thing , and whatever acts that individuals took part in , the full force of the law should take care of them			0
i 'm sure it will			0
' mr @entity155 often drifted off into a world of car chases , hacking phones , blagging , doing rather disagreeable things , and that is no world that i recognise			0
' mr @entity15 took over running the @entity2 in january 2007 after @entity180 resigned as editor when @entity46 and @entity48 were jailed			0
he spoke of losing his job as the @entity184 's editor in 2001 after publishing an interview that led to the collapse of the first criminal trial of footballers @entity188 and @entity190			0
' being an editor is all about learning , and you learn from experience , and sometimes you make the wrong decision			0
the impact of making the wrong decision as an editor can be severe , ' he said .			0

@entity125 representative ' gave @entity200 permission to publish @entity130 's diaries ' claims lawyer , *contradicting* @entity130 's claims
