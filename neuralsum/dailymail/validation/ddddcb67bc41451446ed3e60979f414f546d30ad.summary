if you do n't possess @entity2 's interrogation skills , making someone laugh may encourage them to spill their secrets			2
researchers claim that sharing a few chuckles makes people more willing to tell others something personal about themselves , without necessarily being aware that they are doing so			1
the act of verbally opening up to someone is a crucial building block that helps to form new relationships and intensify social bonds			1
laughing with a stranger ( illustrated with a stock image ) makes us more likely to open up and tell others something personal about ourselves , which encourages bonds of friendship , a new study claims such self - disclosure can be of a highly sensitive nature - like sharing one 's religious convictions or personal fears - or a superficial scrap of information such as a favourite type of food			1
@entity33 of @entity34 ( @entity34 ) set out to investigate the role and influence of laughter in this disclosure process			1
together with his colleagues , he observed the behaviour of 112 students from @entity42 , who did not known each other and were divided into groups of four			2
they watched a 10 - minute video together , without chatting to one another			1
the videos were designed to invoke different amounts of laughter as well as the amount of positive feelings or emotions they elicited			2
participants watched different videos including a clip of comedian @entity58 ( pictured ) to encourage them to laugh one , for example , featured a stand - up comedy routine by @entity58 , while another was a golf instruction video and a third , an excerpt from a nature documentary			1
after the volunteers watched the chosen video , the levels of laughter and their emotional state was measured			1
each group member also had to write a message to another participant to help them get to know each other better			2
the researchers found that participants who had a good laugh together shared significantly more intimate information than the groups who did not watch the comedy routine			1
mr @entity33 suggests this is not merely because it is a positive experience , but because of the physiology behind laughter , which triggers the release of the so - called ‘ happy hormone ’ endorphin			2
the findings , published in @entity91 's journal @entity92 , support the idea that laughter encourages people to make more intimate disclosures to strangers			0
scientists believe that the person who disclosed information , was seldom aware of what they had done , and it was only the listener who realised it had happened			0
‘ this seems to be in line with the notion that laughter is linked specifically to fostering behaviors that encourage relationship development , since observer ratings of disclosure may be more important for relationship development than how much one feels one is disclosing , ’ mr @entity33 said			0
‘ these results suggest that laughter should be a serious topic for those interested in the development of social relationships			0
’ a recent study has revealed that playfulness comes high on the list of desirable attributes in a long - term partner			0
experts say that a sense of fun is more important to many people than whether someone has a degree or is religious			0
research by the @entity133 revealed that playfulness is important to both sexes – just behind friendliness , intelligence and a sense of humour			0
play to win hearts : a new study has revealed that playfulness comes high on the list of desirable attributes in a partner ( illustrated with a stock image ) - just behind friendliness , intelligence and a sense of humour they also found that naturally playful people deem humour , a laid back attitude and creativity more important in partners than their more serious peers			1
they described playful adults as those having a love of wordplay who enjoy teasing , people who are spontaneous and will take on a challenge lightheartedly and those who play the fool , for example			0
reserachers asked asked 327 young adults from @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 to examine a list of 16 characteristics and indicate whether or not they found them desirable in a potential long - term partner			1
the results showed that men and women largely agreed in their orders of preference , although there were differences in individual ratings			0
for example , women found a sense of humour more important than men and men found an exciting personality more important than women			1
friendliness , intelligence , humour and a fun tendency came at the top of the list			0
@entity191 ranked mid-table , although not all that far behind the favourites			0
‘ therefore , this personality trait also seems important for the choice of partner – at least more so that the partner having a degree , good genes or being religious , ’ said dr @entity196 .			0
