by @entity0 published : 08:49 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 10:17 est , 27 march 2013 on trial : @entity2 , 60 , is accused of masterminding a gang of 500 child pick - pockets an @entity6 ' @entity5 ' who is accused of masterminding one of the biggest child pick - pocketing rings in history appears in a @entity12 court today			1
@entity2 , a grandfather from @entity13 , allegedly earned more than £ 1million a year - much of it coming from @entity16 tourists - which he spent on holiday homes , luxury cars and high - rolling casino trips			1
he is said to have controlled a network of up to 500 young girls on the streets of @entity26 , whom he threatened with beatings , cigarette burns to the face and even rape if they failed to steal at least £ 250 every day			1
@entity2 , 60 , apparently told his gang of @entity34 gypsies from countries like @entity36 and @entity37 to concentrate on @entity38 , who were considered particularly easy targets , and also stole from @entity16 visiting the @entity12 capital			2
when the criminal ring was dismantled in 2010 , police said it was responsible for around 75 per cent of all thefts in the @entity26 metro system			2
@entity2 is among 21 defendants , including his wife and two of his sons , appearing at the @entity50 on charges of people trafficking , criminal association and forcing minors to commit crimes			2
@entity2 , who faces up to 20 years in prison , denies all the charges , but has been told to explain how he afforded a villa in @entity59 , a £ 55,000 @entity60 , and regular trips to a casino where he would bet at least £ 140,000 each time			1
he has never declared any income to the taxman , but bought a second home for more than a quarter of a million pounds before his arrest			0
tourists : the criminal gang apparently targeted visitors to @entity26 including @entity16 and especially @entity38 police believe that @entity2 ’s gang earned him more than £ 1million in 2009 alone , enabling him to buy @entity73 sports cars and designer jewellery including a £ 28,000 diamond ring			1
claiming that his references he made to his possessions in taped phone calls were purely fantasy , @entity2 told the court : ‘ we gypsies tend to boast about things that are n't necessarily true			1
’ the court has heard testimonies from two girls , @entity85 , 14 , and @entity86 , 11 , from the former @entity87 , who said they regularly transferred their @entity26 earnings to a safe haven in @entity92			1
if the takings were less than £ 55,000 a week , the girls said they would be ‘ beaten ’			0
@entity5 : @entity2 has been compared to the sinister criminal boss from @entity97 ' @entity96 @entity2 said the girls were part of a plot to incriminate him by a rival @entity13 gangster known as ‘ @entity102 ’			2
he even claimed that the girls had self - harmed so as to make it look as though he was responsible for beating them up			0
‘ there are 500 women and children involved , ' he said			0
' i 'm accused in this affair but have nothing to do with it			0
' @entity2 ’s lawyer , @entity113 , said : ‘ he says he sells cars and that 's how he makes his money			0
there 's no doubt he 's paid little tax in his life , which explains his comfortable lifestyle - but does that mean the money comes from theft , that 's not at all sure			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
