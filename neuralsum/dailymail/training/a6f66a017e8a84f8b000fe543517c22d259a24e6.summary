by @entity0 published : 10:36 est , 26 april 2013 updated : 17:33 est , 26 april 2013 a classic @entity1 which has been left to rot in a garage for more than 40 years is expected to fetch between £ 15,000 and £ 25,000 at auction			1
the @entity4 was one of the world 's top sports cars when it left the factory in 1953			1
but over the past 43 years the car has been left abandoned in a @entity11 garage , where it transformed from a stunning racing car into a heap of rust			1
@entity16 : the 60 - year - old @entity1 was discovered in a disheveled state in a garage in @entity11 , but is still worth at least £ 15,000 heyday : @entity20 ( pictured ) bought the @entity1 from an army lieutenant in the 1950s discovered by auction house @entity24 , the find will come onto the open market for the first time when it goes under the hammer at the auctioneer 's @entity30 sale on saturday			1
although the guide price is a reasonable £ 15,000 to £ 25,000 , experts believe whoever buys the @entity1 will have to spend between £ 50,000 and £ 100,000 to return the car to its former glory			1
the @entity4 was supplied new in 1953 to a lieutenant in the army , who sold it to mechanic @entity20 in 1961			2
mr @entity20 worked for a number of racing teams and competed in various cars before getting his hands on the @entity4			2
the engineer then used his knowhow to turn the @entity1 into a competition car , racing it around the @entity47 at circuits including @entity49 and @entity50			2
under the bonnet of the sir @entity53 - styled roadster was a 3.4 - litre engine which developed 160bhp - giving the car a 0 - 60mph time of 10 seconds and top speed of 126mph			2
abandoned : mr @entity20 had not used the @entity1 in 43 years restoration project : experts estimate it will cost the buyer £ 100,000 to have the car restored professionally , or around £ 50,000 to do it themselves both the car and its driver became well known in @entity1 and racing circles , but mr @entity20 stopped his competition career in the 1970s to focus on aeronautical engineering			1
remarkably , the @entity1 then remained undisturbed at storage at his home in @entity11 for the next four decades			1
@entity71 , from the @entity70 , expects there to be a lot of interest when it goes under the hammer			0
he said : ' it has got a good recorded history which helps prices and when it has been restored it could easily be worth £ 150,000			1
' the key thing is the history and this car will help the owner get into all the events like @entity84 and that is important			0
' the @entity4 was a very important car in the history of @entity1 , it was their first ever genuine sports car and helped put them on the map			0
' there will be a lot of excitement about this			0
it will probably cost around £ 100,000 to restore professionally or at least £ 50,000 if the buyer does it themselves			1
' racing : mr @entity20 used the @entity1 as a competition car at circuits including @entity49 and @entity50 speedy : the @entity4 , built in 1953 , can reach 126mph and go from 0 - 60 in 10 seconds sale : the @entity1 will be auctioned alongside other classic cars at @entity104 in @entity30 on saturday the @entity1 will be sold alongside a number of other classic cars including a @entity107 and @entity108			0

' complete with its original @entity116 book , and with a variety of period racing shots , bills and receipts this must be the most exciting @entity4 discovery this decade			0
' here was a car with incredible style and looks , a powerful six cylinder engine installed in an outstanding chassis and a remarkably low price - a quarter that of a @entity127 , of similar performance			0
' the combination was unbeatable and the @entity4 represented without doubt a significant milestone for both @entity1 and the motor industry as a whole			0
' highly original and unmolested , there will not be a more significant @entity135 available anywhere in this condition			0
