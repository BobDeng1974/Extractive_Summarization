infact , there are findings that suggest about $ 3.8 million of that produce will be thrown in the trash			1
however @entity6 researchers suggest that paying students small amounts of money or handing out prizes in cafeteria increases the number who ate pieces of fruit and veg at lunch			1
what to choose ? @entity6 researches say small rewards offered in the lunchroom will increase the consumption of fruit and veg among children by 80 per cent according to @entity36 , scientists conducted a study to measure of such small rewards in the lunchroom by giving nickels , quarters and raffle tickets only to the kids who ate the healthy snacks on offer			1
the findings , published in @entity47 , showed fruit and veggie consumption increased by 80 per cent , while waste food dropped by 33 per cent			1
some 15 schools were canvassed for the study			2

' we feel a sense of dirtiness about a bribe			0
but rewards can be really powerful in the activity creates a new skill or changes preferences			0
' some fear prizes will prevent children from developing their own motivation to eat things that are good for them , while others fear the boomerang effect -- children eating less fruit and vegetables when the rewards disappeared , the researchers explained			0
critics of the study findings say prizes will prevent children from developing their own motivation to eat things that are good for them @entity54 measured fruit and vegetable consumption before and after the week - long experiments			2
when the week of prizes ended , students went back to the same level of fruit and vegetable consumption as before - no lasting improvement , but no boomerang effect either , the study said			2
the researchers are studying whether extending the experiments over three to five weeks might yield lasting change			0
' i do n't think we should give incentives such a bad rap , ' said @entity54			0
' they should be considered part of a set of tools we can use			0
' the study was inspired by a new federal rule prompting schools across @entity6 to serve an extra $ 5.4 million worth of fruit and vegetables to children each day , in an attempt to make kids more healthy			1
