a taxi driver was tricked out of a fare by two passengers who left a fully clothed mannequin in the car for the final leg of the journey - and promised their ' sleeping ' friend would settle the bill			1
the driver , known only as ' stutter ' , was hailed for a late - night journey from @entity13 train station to @entity14 by three men who agreed on a fee			1
they all got into the cab and headed up to the capital but one of the passengers was said to be ' sleeping '			0
the driver dropped the first man off before heading to the second person 's home			1
the unnamed taxi driver was duped by two men who carried a mannequin ( file picture ) , fully clothed and wearing a hat , into the cab upon arrival , the second man got out , thanked the driver and gave the address of their friend in the back seat and asked him to wake him up when he got to his house			1
