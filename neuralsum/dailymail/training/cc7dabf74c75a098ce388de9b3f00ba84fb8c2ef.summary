by @entity0 for the @entity1 charities should stay away from politics and ‘ stick to their knitting ’ , a @entity3 minister has claimed			2
@entity9 , the minister for civil society , criticised charities that ‘ stray ’ from their remit of ‘ helping others ’			1
in his first major speech since his appointment this summer , mr @entity9 said : ‘ we really want to try and keep charities and voluntary groups out of the realms of politics			1
‘ some 99.9 per cent do exactly that			0
when they stray into the realm of politics that is not what they are about and that is not why people give them money			0
stitch - up : mr @entity9 wants charities to concentrate on knitting instead of ' party political ' campaigning the important thing charities should be doing is sticking to their knitting and doing the best they can to promote their agenda , which should be about helping others			1
’ the comments come after several @entity3 backbenchers attacked @entity40 earlier this year for opposing benefit cuts and zero - hour contracts , claiming that the organisation ’s campaign was too political			1
yesterday @entity45 , @entity46 ’s spokesman for civil society , attacked mr @entity9 ’s comments			1
she also warned that the new @entity49 could limit the ability of charities to campaign on the issues of the day			0
' it ’s his first speech as charities minister , and i think it ’s not just patronising but actually deeply offensive – at a time when charities are picking up the pieces from this government ’s awful , unfair policies – that their ministers would talk about them in such a dismissive way , ’ she said			1
concern : @entity9 insisted he did not want to prevent charities from campaigning generally ‘ this comes from a government that has n’t just introduced the @entity49 but has also restricted charities using judicial review , cut legal aid , ramped up employment tribunal fees and clamped down on immigration appeals			1
‘ what you ’re looking at is a government that does n’t like challenge			0
that is quite a frightening place for a government to have got itself into			0
’ last night mr @entity9 said his comments at a charity conference were intended as a reference to ‘ party politics ’ , adding he did not want to prevent charities from campaigning in general			1
he said : ‘ charities , with all their expertise , have an important role to play in helping to shape government policy			0
while they have the right to campaign they should stay out of the realm of party politics			1
’ conservatives have claimed @entity46 supporters are using charities to run campaigns criticising the government to help @entity98 win the next general election			2
nearly half of @entity103 ’s @entity102 aides are now working for charities and think - tanks – positions from which they have been accused of mounting a guerrilla war on the @entity3			0
eleven out of the 25 special advisers who worked for mr @entity103 when he was prime minister in 2009 have taken roles at various organisations , which critics claim are being used as vehicles for a @entity115 agenda			2
charities are banned by law from giving support or funding to political parties , but in 2008 mr @entity103 tweaked the rules so they could join political campaigns			2
the list of mr @entity103 ’s former colleagues now working in the charity sector includes @entity125 , the chief executive of @entity126			0
the charity was heavily criticised two years ago after it launched an appeal to help children in @entity130 for the first time in its history			0
@entity3 @entity133 claimed it was a political move against the @entity136 government .			0
