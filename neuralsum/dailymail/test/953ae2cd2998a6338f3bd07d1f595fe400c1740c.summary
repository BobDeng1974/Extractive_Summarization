attention is already turning to next season at @entity2 after their @entity4 semi-final exit at the hands of @entity6			2
unless one of the top four falter dramatically in the final six @entity10 games of the season , @entity2 will also miss out on @entity12 qualification after only a season back in @entity14 's elite club competition			2
@entity15 undoubtedly needs to reinforce his squad , and @entity17 assesses @entity2 's chances of landing five of their main targets			2
@entity21 , @entity22 @entity21 has impressed at @entity22 this season and is set to leave @entity24 when his contract expires @entity26 ( left ) and @entity27 appear set to depart @entity2 at the end of the season @entity2 have made their play for @entity21 but his concern has always been that he gets a fair chance of making a starting place his own			1
the @entity33 will look to shed @entity34 , @entity27 and @entity26 but @entity35 arrives from @entity36 in june too			0
@entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 remain in the frame for @entity21			2
@entity41 : £ 4million compensation fee @entity43 , @entity38 has been a little upset by all accounts that his move to @entity2 was reported almost as a done deal			1
@entity43 appears set to depart @entity38 at the end of the season when his contract expires @entity43 ( right ) is also a target for @entity53 and @entity54 , as well as @entity57 sides @entity55 and @entity58 wants to see what @entity38 discuss first and it is all about how many games he plays			0
@entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity58 have also spoken to his representative about a summer deal			0
@entity41 : free @entity66 , @entity67 @entity2 have been frustrated in their pursuit of @entity69 from @entity70 , who is destined for @entity72			1
@entity67 goalkeeper @entity66 ( right ) appears likely to depart @entity73 before next season @entity66 could be out of reach for @entity2 if @entity76 make a move for the goalkeeper they want @entity66 but do n't have the budget to compete with @entity76 , who are confident of signing the experienced @entity67 goalkeeper this summer ahead of @entity53			1
@entity41 : £ 10million @entity83 , @entity84 stylish young central midfielder who has lost his way among @entity84 's stars			0
@entity83 may depart @entity84 this summer and his profile matches @entity2 's recruitment policy has stated a desire to fight for his place but knows chances are limited			1
@entity2 like him , as they do @entity94 at @entity95 also , but face competition from @entity53 and @entity39 although @entity97 has other targets too for that area			0
@entity41 : £ 18million @entity100 , @entity101 fits the bill for @entity15 in terms of pace and pressing style and carries a goal threat			0
@entity76 have also made enquiries , as have @entity37 , who hope @entity110 's presence can sway the deal their way			0
@entity100 ( right ) is an ideal signing for @entity15 , but he must compete with @entity14 's elite side if @entity2 fail to qualify for the @entity12 it may be another deciding factor for the @entity118 international winger			1

@entity2 need new faces in the summer after an *underwhelming* campaign
@entity21 and @entity43 could join when their contracts expire
@entity100 , @entity66 and @entity83 also *linked* to @entity125
