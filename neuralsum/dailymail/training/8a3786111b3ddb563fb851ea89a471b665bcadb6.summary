@entity0 is @entity2 football ’s man of the moment following a hat - trick against @entity5 that grabbed headlines around the world			1
but @entity9 manager @entity8 does not want all the @entity12 striker ’s efforts to be in vain without at least one major trophy to show for them this season			1
it has been @entity8 ’s policy not to get too downcast by some of his team ’s poor results , most notably defeats at @entity21 and at home by @entity23 in the @entity24			2
@entity0 is @entity2 football ’s man of the moment following a hat - trick against @entity5 @entity8 has been praising the @entity12 striker and said he has always known how good he is now he is in the different position of trying to dampen @entity0 - mania ahead of their @entity31 match at @entity32 , who are second , one place above the champions			1
@entity0 has scored half of @entity9 ’s 24 @entity31 goals and five of their seven in the @entity24			1
but having won the @entity31 and @entity39 in his debut season in @entity2 football , it is silverware rather than personal endorsements that interest @entity8			1
asked if @entity0 is in the best moment of his career , the @entity45 said : ‘ i do n’t think so			0
an important career for a player is when you achieve something and @entity0 has had a lot of important moments in his career			1
' for me , the most important thing @entity0 has done so far was scoring the goal to give this club the title [ in 2012 ]			1
’ @entity8 does , however , accept that @entity0 , 26 , is improving with age			1
‘ maybe at 22 or 23 you are too young to decide the correct things at a lot of moments in the game , ’ he said			0
@entity0 gets the better of @entity5 goalkeeper @entity67 to put @entity9 3 - 2 against @entity5 on tuesday @entity0 is mobbed by his @entity9 team - mates after he scores what turned out to be the winning goal ‘ in every game he plays he is growing and he has at least five more years where he is at his top performance			1
’ @entity8 is playing a smart psychological game			0
he does not need to big up @entity74 when the evidence is clear he is the best player in @entity2			0
the way he destroyed one of @entity79 ’s best teams was enthralling and might have helped to turn around @entity9 ’s season			2
certainly he will be uppermost in @entity32 ’s minds			0
the city manager knew about @entity0 well before he moved to the @entity83			0
a decade ago , when he was manager of @entity84 in @entity12 , he heard all about an emerging 16 - year - old striker with one of the country ’s other leading clubs , @entity88			0
@entity9 boss @entity8 has refused to rule out making new signings in january city have the @entity31 's top scorer in @entity0 but other star players have failed to perform this season he said : ‘ from the start , everyone saw he would be a very good player			1
it was n’t normal for someone so young to play so well			0
and when i went to @entity99 with @entity100 , i tried to buy him [ in 2006 ] but @entity101 got him			0
’ despite lagging behind @entity102 , @entity8 knows title races can swing at any time , just as it did last season when @entity106 were favourites until they lost at home against @entity102 in late april			2
and the win against @entity5 has proved @entity9 have the capability of going to the south coast and winning			2
‘ every time you beat an important team like @entity5 , the confidence and trust of the squad rises , ’ said @entity8			2
‘ at this moment last year , we were six points behind @entity118 and no one was talking about us			0
we were fourth or fifth and everyone was saying @entity118 were the team who were going to win the league — and at the end they were fourth			0

@entity8 has sent out a *warning* to @entity9 's players
@entity0 has scored half of @entity9 's @entity31 goals this season
@entity8 says that it is the goals that win titles that are important
