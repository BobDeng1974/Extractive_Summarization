most pensioners keep busy in their retirement by taking water - colour classes or tending to their allotment			2
but @entity4 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , has found an alternative way to stay active in his old age - by dating multiple partners and going to sex parties			1
the 70 - year - old has been frequenting wild swingers events in @entity13 populated by other kinky pensioners for more than 25 years			1
@entity4 has been attending sex parties for 25 years and says they are a great way to stay active @entity4 said : ' it 's good fun to go to parties - especially if you like sex			1
wrote a book called @entity24 and found that men who had more sex were healthier than men who had less sex			2
' sex is for fun - and if you ca n't have a bit of fun in life , where are you ? what are you here for ? ' and as @entity4 's x-rated tales make clear , these parties are definitely not for the frail or faint - hearted			1
' i 've seen some wild things in my time - at one party there was a man in his mid 60s who brought along a younger woman in her early forties , ' he said			0
' she was just going around making out with all of the older guys in the house , i could n't help but watch			0
@entity4 , who is a keen juggler , says he is currently seeing six women aged 29 - 66 @entity4 added : ' afterwards he said to me " it 's a lot of fun , we can enjoy talking about it afterwards "			1
' the ex-academic , a former sociology professor at @entity54 , now works as a part - time clown - and his juggling skills come in handy in his love life			0
@entity4 currently has six women - who range from 29 to 66 in age - on the go at the same time			1
he said : ' i love sex , i 'd say i have it at least twice a week - which i think at my age is pretty good			1
i 've been monogamous for maybe a year or two years but it just did n't work for me - i like variety			2
' i 'm known to my friends as someone who 's had a few relationships in my time			0
but i 'm not in a monogamous relationship , so it 's not as if i 'm betraying anyone			0
' @entity4 achieves his doctorate in philosophy in an award ceremony at @entity54 in july 1981 @entity4 during his time as a professor of sociology at @entity54 while for some pensioners , the passion of youth is a distant memory , @entity4 's sex drive is still up to speed , although these days he requires chemical assistance in the form of @entity84 - which he gets free on the @entity85 - to keep up with the demands of his harem			1
he added : ' at my age it can be difficult to get erections , so i went to my gp and he prescribed me @entity84			2
' at first it was dear , it worked out at £ 110 for 16 tablets - that 's about £ 7 per session of nookie ! it 's much cheaper now since the patent lapsed , but these days i get it free on the @entity85			0
' i only need to take half a tablet , but i 've got a friend who takes two - just to make sure			1
' and despite the numerous notches on his bedpost , @entity4 says he long ago gave up trying to remember the number of women he has bedded			2
@entity4 has written a book entitled the @entity108 of the @entity109 which he proudly holds professor @entity4 works part time as a clown , here he shows off his juggling batons he said : ' i stop counting when i got to 25 in my twenties - but it 's definitely more than 100			1
' that only works out at a bit over one a year - although even now , i doubt a year would go by without me gaining a new partner			1
' and far from being seedy , the silver - haired lothario is keen to paint his womanising as a form of public service			0
he said : ' when you are younger you 've got a lot of sexual urges but there 's not that many women around because a lot of them will be locked up by their father			0
' but when you 're old like me , there 's lots of women available because a lot of the men have died off - so i can offer support to several women			0
i like to think that what i do is noble			0
' @entity4 attends swinging parties with his friends , notoriously at swinging parties people throw their keys into a bowl in order to find themselves new partner @entity4 poses with his son @entity148 , @entity4 has four different children by three different women @entity4 is due to appear in @entity151 , a new @entity153 series showcasing the lives of @entity109 's wildest pensioners			1
the twice - divorced , @entity157 - loving academic has four children by three different women - as well as a coterie of regular lovers around the globe			0
in the @entity109 they include a gp who is a long - term lover , one of his female bridge partners , and a woman from @entity166 who he met when supervising her @entity167 and now lives in the @entity109			2
however , @entity4 also has sexual partners overseas , including a 29 - year - old lady in @entity170 , and a retired social worker in @entity172			1
and while his sexual exploits may be unusual among men his age , he has no plans to give up his womanising ways any time soon			0
' i hope i 'm still going when i 'm 90 , ' he added			0
