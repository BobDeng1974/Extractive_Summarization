by @entity0 it was the rom com that defined the early 2000s			0
but the manipulative and undermining world portrayed in @entity6 's film @entity7 is far from fiction , teachers claim			0
though boys can be rowdy , their female classmates are ' meaner and smarter in their approach ' - and deliberately target women teachers to demonstrate their dominance			1
' nightmare ' : teachers claim popular girls , like the ' plastics ' in mean girls , are manipulative and impossible to control targeted : secondary school teacher @entity19 says she , like @entity22 's character , is targeted by these girls the claims appear to dispel long - held beliefs that girls have a calming influence on school life			1
secondary school teacher @entity19 told the @entity29 : ' boys are far more malleable			1
they are not perfect : the aggressive ones shout their mouths off and scarper , sometimes punching walls along the way			0
' but girls are decidedly meaner and smarter in their approach			0
' she added : ' the queen bee will often try to use her top - notch position to undermine female teachers			2
' it is difficult to teach a girl who feels you should be her subordinate , especially when said girl believes that complying with the most basic requirements would mean showing weakness in front of her friends			0
' another female teacher said : ' classroom management-wise , girls are an absolute nightmare for female secondary school teachers '			1
manipulative : teachers claim girls will do anything to stop female teachers dispelling their sense of power in a 2012 report on gender and behaviour in schools , the @entity61 found boys aged 11 to 14 are far worse behaved than their female classmates			1
however , boys are more likely to admit when they have misbehaved than girls			2
boys in that age group , the report stated , show a sharp surge in their displays of anti-social behaviour - such as verbal abuse and aggression			2
meanwhile , a significant proportion of girls experience problems related to self - harm , depression and eating disorders .			0

secondary school teachers describe ' difficult ' popular girls in class
their claims dispel long - held belief that girls are calming influence
comes after @entity61 report found girls ' less likely to admit they misbehave '
