@entity0 used to be unfortunate centre - backs who felt the brunt of @entity5 ’s directness in a challenge			1
now it is the financial powerbrokers at @entity9			2
to @entity13 , doing everything to retain both @entity11 and @entity12 is essential for the @entity15 club if they are to begin enticing supporters back through the turnstiles			1
enough is enough , he insists , when it comes to star quality drifting away from the east end of @entity23			1
a key figure in the @entity26 era , @entity13 accepts the monetary environment is far more demanding for @entity9 in the present day			2
yet he would also contend that it does n’t provide a permanent excuse			2
@entity11 , @entity32 ’s reigning @entity31 , is out of contract at the end of the season ‘ i do think there comes a time when you look at the crowds , and the stadium is half full , where @entity9 are going to have to show some intent at some stage , ’ argued @entity13 , who will be back at @entity15 as part of the @entity37 presenting team for thursday 's tie with @entity40			1
‘ they need to draw a line in the sand because fans go to football matches to watch players			2
‘ top players get bums on seats			2
if commons goes and if @entity12 does n’t sign then what message does that send out to the @entity9 fans ? ‘ i think it is important that @entity9 show intent and do try to get commons and @entity12 signed up , and then add to that if possible			1
i know we have to be realistic in the marketplace that @entity9 are buying from , but that is the challenge			2
’ @entity9 manager @entity69 keeps a close eye on @entity12 during training on wednesday commons , @entity32 ’s reigning @entity31 , is out of contract at the end of the season			1
discussions over an extension have so far failed to bear fruit and @entity78 clubs — including @entity79 and @entity80 — are circling ahead of the january transfer window			1
at 31 , @entity11 is hardly in the first flush of youth			1
there will be precious little resale value — the commodity which helps fuel @entity9 ’s business plan — if he were to stay for another couple of seasons			2
@entity13 , however , is adamant that accepting a fee next month — or watching him exit as a free agent — would be the falsest of economies			0
‘ i do n’t think @entity9 can afford to let him go , ’ he maintained			0
‘ because who do they get to replace him ? ‘ i know this season he has not really got going through no fault of his own but he has still shown , in the @entity103 game for example , that he has the class to turn a game			1
‘ now @entity9 do n’t have enough of those players			0
whatever you say about @entity109 , he is not as good a footballer — he might have better legs but commons can still change a game at the top level			0
@entity9 team - mates @entity12 ( top ) and @entity118 joke around in training ‘ why would you want to let him go ? it ’s common sense — unless his wage demands are off the planet , which i doubt they are			1
@entity9 are making an enormous mistake if they do n’t get him signed			0
‘ the longer it goes , you can imagine @entity11 sitting there thinking : “ well , if they are not going to show willing to me — a player who has given good service , @entity31 last year , 32 goals and the most aware player @entity9 have ... ” ‘ it did happen in my time , it happened to me , and there is a point where the player wants something back			1
‘ i am not party to what has happened in the talks but it looks to me like @entity9 are going to lose @entity11			1
‘ i hope they do n’t but the longer it goes , the more it looks like he will be heading down south			0
’ @entity12 ’s future is open to equal speculation			1
with 10 goals in 11 appearances since joining on loan from @entity153 , the super-confident @entity149 is the kind of striker @entity15 season - ticket holders have hankered after for years			1
the problem , of course , is that this return to the prolific form he once exhibited at @entity162 is attracting attention south of @entity164			0
@entity12 has scored 10 goals in 11 appearances since joining on loan from @entity153 it seems likely that more lucrative offers will be available elsewhere , but @entity13 believes there would be wisdom in compromising financial interests			1
‘ both parties suit each other , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s been good for @entity12 coming to @entity9 and they are a different team with him in it			1
‘ he has that goal - scoring threat which maybe no other centre - forward at the club has			1
‘ he can score all different types of goals			1
imagine @entity9 getting through to the latter stages of the @entity181 and they have him to come in ? that ’s a massive boost			0
‘ @entity12 might have other options			1
but sometimes when you have it good , and i know this from my own experience , you should not underestimate that			0
i hope he does sign , i think on balance he will sign — he would be stupid not to			0
’ @entity9 may have to stretch their existing wage structure to reach a happy outcome			0
@entity13 sees no issue with that and is dismissive of the argument that it could cause dressing - room unrest			1
‘ listen , @entity197 deserved to be the best - paid player at @entity9 in my time because he was the best player , ’ said @entity13			2
former striker @entity5 has warned @entity9 board they must send a strong message to fans ‘ it ’s ridiculous for players to bother about what other players are on			2
if @entity12 comes in on a big wage and he scores a few goals and does well for @entity9 , at home and in @entity209 , then he deserves his wages			1
i do n’t think that is an issue			0
‘ if it is an issue then you have the wrong people in the dressing - room			2
’ @entity13 has been fiercely critical of some of @entity9 ’s displays under @entity69 this term , branding the laboured home win over @entity221 last month as ‘ pathetic ’			0
thursday , he feels , will bring a stern test of the progress made since then			0
@entity13 would not be surprised to see @entity40 make the @entity181 in @entity224			0
‘ i have just been truthful , ’ argued @entity13			0
‘ in terms of where @entity9 should be judged , for me it is the @entity181			0
‘ it would be an enormous achievement for them to qualify			0
when you look at recent domestic games , including saturday ’s win over @entity235 , they have enough to play mediocre games and still win the @entity238 league			0
‘ but if they do n’t put on a performance in this one then they will get drubbed because they ( @entity40 ) are the best team @entity9 will have played this season			2
‘ @entity40 have improved a lot since @entity9 played well in @entity245			0
i think they lost a game after that 2 - 2 draw but since then they have won 11 out of 13			1
i know @entity9 had a tough time against @entity251 but i think @entity40 are a better team			0
’ @entity253 have live coverage of @entity181 games throughout the group stages and beyond , as well as live coverage of four @entity259 games before the end of next month , including @entity261 v @entity9 ( dec 21 )			2
