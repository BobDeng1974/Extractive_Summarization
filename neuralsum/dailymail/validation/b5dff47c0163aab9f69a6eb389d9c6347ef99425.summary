@entity1 's hopes of playing july 's @entity3 quarter final at @entity4 look likely to be fulfilled after positive noises emanated today from the famous west @entity7 venue			1
while there will undoubtedly be logistical challenges in hosting what is @entity12 's biggest home tie in 29 years there appears an enthusiasm among the club 's hierarchy to overcome them			0
given @entity1 's desire to play at a venue where he has won the @entity21 title three times already , there is likely to be a concerted effort to make it happen , including on the part of the @entity26			1
@entity1 with the @entity27 at the @entity4 in @entity7 last month ' we have been approached , along with some other venues , and are actively looking at whether or not we could host it , ' said a queen 's spokesman			2
' there are a number of logistical issues that would have to be resolved , but if it is possible to overcome them @entity32 would be delighted to host the @entity3 in july			1
' that date of july 17 - 19 comes nearly four weeks after the conclusion of the @entity21 , which is the main @entity41 warm - up			1
among the issues is keeping up the huge main stand which takes the centre court capacity to nearly 7,000 , above the 6,000 threshold required for a quarter final			0
other challenges include a scheduled refurbishment of the clubhouse due to begin in early july , and making sure the grass court – the quality of which is reckoned to be at least @entity41 's equal – can recover in time from the summer @entity54 event			0
@entity1 celebrates beating @entity55 in the @entity3 to set up a quarter - final against @entity57 for @entity12 the @entity59 no 1 won the @entity61 tournament at @entity32 's in 2013 ( left ) , 2011 ( centre ) and 2009 ( right ) @entity12 vs @entity57 @entity63 vs @entity64 @entity65 vs @entity66 @entity67 vs @entity68 it will also require considerable commitment and patience from members , with the construction of the main stand already beginning in early may and the prospect of it being up on the site of two hard courts for nearly three months			1
it had been thought the disruption might be too prolonged , although today 's statement appears to knock that down			0
at the weekend @entity1 , due to play @entity84 's @entity83 in @entity85 on monday night , pointed not only to his own good record at @entity32 but also the fact that his brother @entity88 has made the doubles final there and @entity91 the semi-finals			2
however , it is also a place where @entity57 players have done well , notably @entity96 , who is an enormously popular regular visitor			0
the @entity97 is in action at the @entity85 in @entity85 , facing @entity83 on monday night @entity99 , @entity101 's @entity100 and @entity102 have also been approached , but @entity1 's opinion carries a decisive amount of weight			0
@entity57 were the opposition when @entity32 's last staged a @entity3 tie , back in 1990			2
@entity110 were beaten 5 - 0 then , but with @entity1 in his prime and @entity57 ' s players by and large – bar the presently injured @entity96 – not at their best on grass , it is likely to be extremely close this time			2
with a three week gap between @entity116 and @entity41 this year , it means there will be six weeks of top - class grass court tennis played in the @entity59 this summer			0
@entity1 poses with friend and former @entity21 tournament director @entity120 at @entity32 's @entity1 on the centre court at the @entity4 , where he has won the @entity21 three times			1

@entity12 host @entity57 in the @entity3 quarter - finals on july 17 - 19
@entity1 has *voiced* his *preferred* venue would be the @entity4
the @entity97 has won the @entity21 , held at @entity32 , three times
