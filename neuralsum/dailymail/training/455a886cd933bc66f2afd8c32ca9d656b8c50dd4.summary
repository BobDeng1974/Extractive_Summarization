@entity0 already downhearted at missing out on reaching the @entity2 final watched in dismay last night as their national team lost to the @entity6 3 - 0 in the third - place match			1
across the nation , fans hoping for some redemption were crushed as @entity11 failed to score - and said their only solace was that the country managed to put on a good @entity2 show for the world			1
any hope among supporters in @entity18 that their team could restore national pride after the infamous 7 - 1 beating by @entity22 last tuesday ran for less than three minutes - when the first goal went in			1
‘ you go into things with great expectations , but rarely do those expectations play out in reality , ’ mr @entity40 said			0
’ in @entity36 , tens of thousands of fans watched the game on a massive tv on @entity35 and the mostly @entity0 crowd stood in silence as the @entity6 knocked in one goal after another			1
@entity60 fans who have flooded into the city ahead of their country 's final match against @entity22 today cheered and chanted songs mocking @entity11 's football prowess			1
at the @entity68 street fest in @entity36 where thousands cheered @entity11 in earlier tournament games , only a few hundred showed up on saturday			2
small business owner @entity71 was among them wearing @entity11 's national team jersey			2
she was disgusted with the outcome			0
‘ i 'm trying to forget the whole thing , but it 's going to be difficult , ’ said ms @entity71 , 56			0
‘ if you draw you forget , but if you lose like we do , forgetting is impossible			0
’ celebration : @entity6 players show off their medals after beating @entity11 in third place play - off winner : @entity6 coach @entity85 ( left ) receives medal from @entity34 president @entity87 dream start : @entity89 scores from the spot against @entity0 goalkeeper @entity40 in the third minute on @entity35 , university student @entity91 shook his head in dismay each time @entity11 seemed like it would score but missed opportunities			1
‘ i 'm proud of being @entity0 but i 'm mad because we could have been making history , ’ the 20 - year - old business student said			1
‘ the team has not shown what it is capable of doing and the only salvation is that @entity11 has managed to show it could pull off a good @entity2			2
’ @entity102 , an 18 - year - old high school student , said she hoped @entity11 's @entity2 would be remembered more for the people 's hospitality than for the national team 's losses , especially @entity11 's 7 - 1 thrashing by @entity22			1
‘ this @entity2 should go down in history for the friendliness of the fans , for the party we through and not for the 7 - 1 defeat , ’ said ms @entity102 , who watched the game from @entity109			1
@entity116 , a 33 - year - old administrative assistant , said @entity11 's team for the 2014 tournament will be remembered as its worst ever			1
upset : a fan of @entity11 reacts as she watches as the @entity6 score a second goal against @entity11 at the @entity34 in @entity121 looking up : fans of @entity11 watch a live broadcast of the @entity2 third - place match on @entity35 , @entity36 varying emotions : a performer dressed in an @entity128 costume holds an @entity60 flag outside the @entity34 area on @entity35 ‘ we did n't have any sort of strategy , no cohesion , no game and only one good player , ’ he said , referring to @entity131 , who was knocked out of the competition with an injury			1
‘ the one good thing that might come out of this humiliation would be if people remember this feeling at the ballot boxes during the elections ’ in october to select a new president			0
‘ @entity11 is going through hard times : on the pitch and off , ’ he said			2
while many @entity0 objected to the billions spent to put on the @entity2 , few protests materialized during the event			2
but 66 - year - old @entity152 said the team 's terrible performance reinforced her opposition to big spending by @entity11 for international sporting events			1
the country next hosts the @entity159			0
‘ how can you hold an event like this in a country with zero health , zero education ? ’ she asked			0
‘ the quantities that were spent were vast and in vain			0
@entity169 : @entity11 goalkeeper @entity40 fails to save penalty from @entity172 in third minute @entity173 : @entity172 celebrates with team - mate @entity174 ( up ) after scoring the opening goal ‘ for this @entity2 , the only things that were done were the visible things that foreigners would see and notice			1
the invisible things , things that really matter , were left undone			0
’ @entity181 will arrive in @entity182 this week as a winner after heaping more misery on @entity11 ’s wretched @entity2 campaign			1
@entity85 is set to be unveiled at @entity186 on thursday with his reputation enhanced from a rewarding month in @entity188 that saw @entity6 qualify from the @entity190 and last night complete an impressive third - place finish			1
for @entity11 , while they were n’t thrashed quite as badly as they had been against @entity22 in tuesday night ’s historic semi-final , a second successive heavy defeat on home soil was a devastating end to a campaign which promised so much			1
manager @entity199 , a @entity2 winner in 2002 , surely wo n’t be able to survive this			0
he ’s been accused by 200 million people of picking the wrong players and choosing the wrong tactics			0
on last night ’s evidence in @entity18 , they are n’t all be wrong			0
@entity6 carried on where @entity22 left off with two goals in the opening 17 minutes – both the result of blunders from @entity0 centre - backs @entity212 and @entity213			1
clinical : @entity6 defender @entity215 lashes the ball into the net for second goal against @entity11 all together now : @entity215 ( second left ) celebrates scoring @entity6 's second goal against @entity11 the @entity188 huffed and puffed after that without ever suggesting they had the quality to launch a fightback and @entity224 completed the humiliation in injury - time			1
@entity199 made six changes from the team humiliated by @entity22 for a third - place play - off which for once carried some meaning			1
@entity85 stuck with his big guns @entity230 and @entity172 though @entity232 did n’t last beyond the warm - up after tweaking a hamstring and had to be replaced by @entity235 of @entity236			1
after three minutes of the game last night , @entity212 , who missed the semi-final debacle through suspension , was n’t strong enough to stop @entity172 from turning midway in the @entity0 half and releasing @entity230			1
as the @entity241 forward sped towards the penalty area , @entity212 gave a despairing tug at the back of his shirt			0
the connection probably happened just outside the penalty area but @entity230 fell inside , and referee @entity248 awarded a penalty that @entity172 converted high and hard			2
the only consolation for @entity11 was that @entity212 escaped with just a yellow card when he ’d clearly denied @entity230 a goalscoring opportunity			2
by 17 minutes , @entity11 had conceded again leading to fears of another humiliating drubbing			2
@entity213 was again the fall - guy , heading a clearance straight to @entity215 who had time to take two touches to control the ball with his left foot and then dispatch a finish with his right into the roof of the net past @entity40			2
blow : @entity6 defender @entity215 was injured in challenge on @entity11 's @entity267 ( left ) agony : injured defender @entity215 is carried off on a stretcher @entity11 looked shellshocked but while @entity22 were hungry for more goals on tuesday night , the @entity271 were happy to sit back until they got opportunities to hit the hosts on the counter-attack			1
@entity267 started to see more of the ball and was unlucky that his whipped - in free - kick did n’t get a decisive touch off @entity280 team - mate @entity279 or @entity281			0
one solo run and shot by @entity267 was saved by @entity283 – @entity11 ’s only effort on target in the entire first half			2
even in low gear , @entity6 seemed more likely to score			2
@entity89 had a low shot saved by @entity40 and when the @entity271 broke , they met little resistance from a woeful @entity0 midfield			2
@entity199 , whose job looks certain end sooner rather than later , made a change at the interval with @entity297 ’s @entity296 replacing @entity298			0
@entity298 ’s only contribution of the opening 45 minutes had been to leave @entity174 with a nasty gash on the back of his head with a wayward arm			0
but it did n’t improve much for @entity11 after half - time			2
the harder poor @entity213 tried , the worse it got for him as he gave the ball away with regularity			0
the scorer of an incredible free - kick against @entity310 could n’t beat @entity283 with a relatively tame effort when given a shooting chance from 25 yards			0
@entity313 must be thinking he ’s a genius for selling the shaggy - haired defender for £ 40million before the @entity2			0
clincher : @entity6 midfielder @entity224 seals victory with injury - time strike down and out : @entity224 scored the 10th goal against @entity11 in two games - a new low nightmare : injured @entity131 could n't bear to watch as @entity11 went down to @entity6 his former @entity280 team - mate @entity267 did n’t fare much better			1
he was booked for diving when he ran into @entity215 and then somersaulted in the air looking for a penalty			0
poor blind had to be carried off with a hurt knee as a result of the coming - together and @entity329 replaced him for the last 20 minutes			0
by the time @entity199 introduced @entity331 for the latter stages , you knew he and the entire nation were desperate			0
it was no surprise when the muscular forward got himself into a good shooting position and then took a wild swipe at the ball to send it wide			0
@entity85 was angry that @entity230 – who admitted diving earlier in the tournament – had two decent penalty appeals turned down			0
but ultimately , it did n’t matter			0
in fact , @entity329 crossed for @entity344 to make it 3 - 0 and @entity181 was able to send on third - choice goalkeeper @entity346 to ensure all 23 of his players in @entity11 had tasted some action - a nice touch			1
the contrast between the relaxed way @entity6 ’s players found space and knocked the ball around compared to the hypertension in @entity11 ’s game was evident			1
if @entity181 can replicate it at @entity186 , the fallen champions will be more than happy .			0

@entity0 crowd in silence as @entity6 knock in one goal after another
@entity172 , @entity215 and @entity224 secure 3 - 0 victory
@entity11 *embarrassingly* beaten 7 - 1 in semi-final by @entity22 last tuesday
