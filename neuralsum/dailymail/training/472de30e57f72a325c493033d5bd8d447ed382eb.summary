by @entity0 published : 17:28 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 02:25 est , 10 october 2013 announcement : @entity2 admitted that the 700,000 figure was in fact a ' very rough estimate ' more than 700,000 private investors have applied for shares in @entity8 – in a rush that could leave many people empty - handed			1
the controversial privatisation has been over-subscribed nearly seven times over , it was announced yesterday			0
business secretary @entity2 told @entity14 his ‘ very rough estimate ’ was that 700,000 private investors signed up for shares before the midnight deadline on tuesday			1
the total number is expected to rise even higher , possibly to 750,000 , as some postal applications have not yet been included in the figure			1
dr @entity21 , chief executive of the @entity22 which represents small shareholders , said : ‘ it is clear that small investors should be the backbone of @entity8 plc. governments have been elected on smaller majorities than 700,000			2
‘ these investors will demand and expect fair play when the final allocation is made			2
’ @entity33 , chief executive of @entity34 , one of the authorised brokers , said the demand for shares highlights the ‘ real appetite for private share ownership and investing ’ in @entity42			1
and @entity43 , from investment giant @entity44 , said : ‘ it has been many years since investors have been so excited about an ipo [ a flotation , also known as an initial public offering ]			2
’ on monday business minister @entity50 said he was ‘ committed to making sure small investors get their fair share ’			2
but he confirmed that around 70 per cent of the government ’s shares will be reserved for big investors such as hedge funds , leaving only ‘ around 30 per cent ’ for small private investors			1
it is still not clear how shares will be divided between members of the public who sign up to the flotation			1
earlier this week , @entity63 , vice-president of @entity64 , another authorised broker , said the ‘ vast majority ’ had asked for more than the minimum of £ 750			0
delicate delivery : given the sensitivity around the privitisation the final decision as to how to divide up the shares may end up being made by the prime minister one option is for everybody to be given £ 750 of shares			2
people who applied for more than this might be given a percentage of the extra amount			0
for example , if they applied for £ 10,000 of shares , they also could get 20 per cent of £ 9,250			0
given the political sensitivity of the privatisation , the final decision might end up being made by the prime minister , sources said last night			0
meanwhile , @entity8 ’s executives and other staff will get priority over members of the public , under the ‘ employee priority offer ’			0
chief executive @entity93 and ten other directors have applied for a total of £ 500,000 of shares , according to the company ’s prospectus			0
under the deal , they will pay the same price as other retail investors – between £ 2.60 and £ 3.30 per share – but will ‘ receive priority on up to the first £ 10,000 of shares applied for ’			1
yesterday mr @entity2 warned the @entity106 boss , who currently earns £ 1.5million a year , that she will have to show ‘ appropriate restraint ’ over her pay package after the state - owned giant is privatised			1
staff benefits : all @entity8 employees will be eligible for a chunk of free shares in the company and could stand to make a substantial profit speaking to mps on the @entity118 , he urged miss @entity93 and her fellow directors to resist the temptation of rapidly escalating their pay – or face the government trying to block their pay packages as a minority shareholder			1
he also rejected accusations that shares are being sold cheaply , insisting that the price range was ‘ entirely sensible and robust ’			0
he said the decision had been made after extensive consultation with the @entity131			0
@entity132 , chairman of the @entity133 , then confronted him over the type of institutional investor who will be allowed to buy shares			0
he read out one of mr @entity2 ’s previous quotes , which said : ‘ why should good companies be destroyed by short - term investors looking for a speculative killing while their accomplices in the @entity131 make fat fees ? ’ but mr @entity2 insisted attempts are being made to freeze such ‘ spivs and speculators ’ out of the flotation , and focus instead on ‘ responsible , long - term institutional investors ’ .			1

but the figure could still rise as @entity2 calls it a ' very rough estimate '
and no - one yet knows how the shares will be divided up between hedge funds , employees and private investors
