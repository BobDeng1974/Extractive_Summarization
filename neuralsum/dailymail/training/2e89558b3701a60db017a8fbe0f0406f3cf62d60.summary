by @entity0 council chiefs have come under fire for spending £ 2,000 of taxpayers ’ money on a new lamppost that leaves the pavement below in darkness - because it 's been erected behind a conifer tree			2
not one beam of light can escape from the 20ft - high lamppost , which has left baffled pedestrians completely in the dark			1
it was installed by @entity18 highways contractor @entity16 as part of its upgrade of the city ’s 95,000 street lamps			1
dim installation : a woman looks up at the new lamppost on @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 , that was recently installed , but disappears behind a conifer bush plan : council contractor @entity16 are now contacting the homeowner who owns the trees to discuss trimming the foliage back the council , the largest local authority in @entity39 , paid @entity16 around £ 2,000 to install the new lamppost which is part of a major upgrade project			1
old fashioned and costly fluorescent lights are being replaced with energy - efficient led models			2
@entity45 councillor @entity44 , who represents the @entity47 ward , expressed his anger at the lamppost , which was erected on @entity27 in @entity50 , last week			1
expense : @entity18 paid @entity16 around £ 2,000 to install the new lamppost , which is part of a major upgrade project he fumed : ‘ it ’s a real shame , as most of the street lights have made a big improvement to the area			1
‘ i could n’t believe my eyes when i saw what the contractors had done			0
it must have taken a super-human effort to get it so well hidden inside those trees			0
‘ not one luminous ray can escape to light up the highway , it ’s so perfectly concealed			0
not so bright : light from the lamppost does n't reach the ground ‘ the contractor should have ensured the foliage was removed first			2
‘ this sort of thing gets the contractors and the council a bad name			2
people have good reason to question the plain common sense of a public service that can do things like this without a word of explanation to the residents , who are the ones being left in the dark			1
’ resident @entity85 , 54 , who lives on the road , said : ‘ it beggars belief that the contractors did n’t use even a tiny piece of common sense when they put up the lamppost			0
‘ it ’s an obvious thing to say but whoever thought it was a good idea to put a lamppost behind a tree clearly is n’t very bright themselves			0
‘ the old lamppost protruded out from the trees so despite the conifers being quite thick the light still reached the pavement			0
this new lamppost is utterly pointless			0
’ @entity16 are now contacting the homeowner who owns the trees to discuss trimming the foliage back			1
@entity16 ’s highways network manager @entity107 said : ' all our highways work is carried out to agreed timescales and designed in line with national standards			1
this includes the position of street lighting columns			0
we are aware of the obstruction caused by the overgrown tree and we are working closely with the property owner to ensure this is removed			0
' this is not the first time @entity16 has encountered protests while installing lampposts			1
in 2012 , residents in @entity126 successfully got lamps upgraded to heritage - style design and relocated at alleyway entrances to maximise security			2
a spokesman for @entity18 refused to comment .			0

@entity134 residents left in the dark after *blunder* by contractor @entity16

@entity45 councillor @entity44 said it ' gives councils a bad name '
