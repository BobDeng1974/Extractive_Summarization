by @entity0 a @entity2 jury has rejected a claim that a woman developed post-traumatic stress disorder that made her fear the frozen food aisle in stores because she found a rat in her frozen lemonade			1
@entity10 , 50 , testified in a @entity12 civil trial that her friend opened a can of @entity16 frozen lemonade on a july night two years ago to prepare for a dinner party and found a frozen rat inside			1
ms. @entity10 claimed her friends were pouring the can of lemonade into a pitcher when a dead rat and maggots fell out causing her emotional distress			0
she told the court that she was forced to keep the dead rat in her freezer for more than a week until a @entity29 courier arrived to pick it up			1
ratted out : @entity10 claims that as she poured a can of @entity16 concentrate , a rat and some maggots came out the frozen rat , @entity35 ’s attorney said , was on display throughout the three - day civil trial			2
@entity35 also sued @entity38 and @entity39 , saying that she was so traumatized at seeing fur , tail and teeth in her drink that she was afraid of the frozen food section at supermarkets and thought sudden movements behind her could be a rat			0
but a @entity49 jury ruled in favor of the defendants in the suit and denied @entity35 a civil settlement , a ruling applauded by @entity29			0
@entity29 countered the argument with a video tour of the factory where the lemonade was packaged , experts on the life cycle of the maggot , and even doctors offering alternate explanations for her anxiety attacks			2
kept on ice : the actual rat made an appearance in court after being kept in cold storage for the last two years ( not actual rat pictured ) ' this verdict affirms that @entity16 beverages meet the highest quality standards at all times , ' said @entity76 , a spokesperson for @entity29			1
' our production process and stringent quality protocols make it virtually impossible for this situation to occur			0
it ’s unfortunate that someone would seek to profit from such baseless allegations			0
we are pleased the ruling was in our favor			0
' smelling a rat : @entity29 claim that their entire @entity89 - based production system is so hygienic there is no way a rat could have made it into the operation			1

@entity96 was allegedly *lurking* in minute maid lemonade concentrate
@entity29 told her to keep the rat in the freezer until the company could pick it up
the actual rat made an appearance at the trial after being kept in cold storage for two years !
