an electromagnetic pulse that could have knocked electrical equipment over continent - scale regions barely missed @entity4 two weeks ago , it has been revealed			1
electromagnetic pulses , also known as @entity6 , are massive surges of energy that can come from a severe solar flare or from a high altitude nuclear explosion			1
‘ the world escaped an @entity18 catastrophe , ’ @entity11 , who now heads @entity12 , a group pushing for missile defence , told @entity15			2
electromagnetic pulses , also known as @entity6 , are massive surges of energy that can come from a severe solar flare , such as this one pictured on may 12 , or from a high altitude nuclear explosion on september 1 , 1859 , astronomer , @entity23 observed a sudden flash over a large area of sunspots on the sun. within 60 seconds the flash had already started to disappear , but early the next morning , there were reports that the northern lights were so bright that people could read the newspaper as if it were daylight			1
at the same time strange things began happening worldwide telegraph systems			2
telegraph operators were being shocked unconscious and the flying sparks were setting their machines on fire			0
when the telegraph operators disconnected their machines from the batteries , there were still sparks flying			0
this is because the power of solar flares induced electricity into the lines that carried the telegraph signals			1
' there had been a near miss about two weeks ago , a @entity23 - class coronal mass ejection crossed the orbit of the @entity4 and basically just missed us , ’ added @entity55 , who served on the @entity56			1
‘ basically this is a @entity58 roulette thing , ’ he said			0
‘ we narrowly escape from a @entity23 - class disaster			1
’ the event is n’t rare			0
in 1989 , an @entity18 effect in @entity62 knocking out @entity64 's electric transmission system			0
and on may 12 , one of the largest solar flares to be recorded this year took place			1
the @entity68 sent billions of tons of solar particles into space , but they were not traveling in @entity4 's direction			1
an overall increase in solar flare activity has been observed in the past 12 months , as the @entity68 reaches the peak of its 11 - year cycle			2
president @entity79 ’s former director of central intelligence , @entity80 , led a panel earlier this week on the threat of a natural or nuclear emp			0
experts have also recently demanded that @entity85 prepare the nation 's electric grid for an @entity18			0
a study into solar storms last year predicted there was a one in eight chance of a major one affecting @entity4 by 2020			1
the @entity92 , however is relatively well prepared for an extreme solar weather event , according to experts at the @entity95 emps can destroy electrical equipment over continent - scale regions they want the 2,000 - 3,000 transformers in the @entity102 grid protected with a high - tech metal box and spares ready to rebuild the system			1
according to @entity80 , knocking out only 20 of these would shut down electricity to parts of the nation for a long time			0
@entity80 told secrets , however , that some in @entity110 are interested in the issue , but the administration is just in the ‘ beginnings ’ of paying attention			0
a study into solar storms last year predicted there was a one in eight chance of a major one affecting @entity4 by 2020			1
the @entity92 , however is relatively well prepared for an extreme solar weather event , according to experts behind the @entity95 ’s report ‘ extreme space weather : impacts on engineered systems and infrastructure ’			2
professor @entity126 , chair of the working group that produced the @entity95 ’s report , said : ‘ it ’s an inevitable natural hazard and it will have a wide impact on technology			0
extreme space weather has been variously described by some as inconsequential , and by others as potentially cataclysmic			0
‘ simplistically , our view is that solar super storms will be a challenge for the @entity92 to deal with but certainly not cataclysmic			2
and our motto in all this is : “ do n’t panic but do prepare ” ’			0

@entity4 has narrowly missed electromagnetic pulses caused by solar flares
if they had hit , the pulses could have knocked out electrical equipment over continent - scale regions
