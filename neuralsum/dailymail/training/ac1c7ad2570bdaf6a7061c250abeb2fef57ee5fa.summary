this incredible map shows how @entity1 have quit smoking over the past 40 years because of higher taxes on tobacco and an increased awareness about the dangers of lighting up			1
the map , created by @entity8 used data from an annual report on the tax burden of tobacco prepared by the @entity12 , to show the decline on a state - by - state basis			0
it shows how @entity1 consumed an average of 125 packs of cigarettes a year between the late 1950s and the late 1980s			1
but today that figure has fallen to just 46 packs of cigarettes per capita every year			1
the sharp decline in the numbers of smokers appears to reflect a change in our attitudes to the habit , according to a researcher			1
' it 's a shift in social norms , ' @entity30 , report author for the @entity31 said			0
' people no longer see smoking around non-smokers as socially acceptable behaviour			1
' in 1970 , residents in all but two states smoked more than 90 packs of cigarettes a year , according to the @entity42			1
by 2012 , residents of just three states — @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 — smoked that much			0
out of fashion : a researcher suggested that there has been a shift in ' social norms ' over smoking the decline in smoking is , in part , due to the taxes that all 50 states and the @entity59 levy on packs of cigarettes and other tobacco products			1
but this was n't always the case			0
in 1921 , @entity65 instituted the first tobacco tax			0
that year , the state collected $ 324,000 in taxes			2
@entity69 was the last state to hold off from implementing a tax and levied its first tax on cigarettes of just 2 cents a pack , in 1969			2
today , taxes continue to rise steadily			2
revenue : the revenue generated from cigarette sales was $ 126 million for @entity80 alone , more than a quarter of the total city and county tax generated across the country in the @entity83 the levies are $ 4.35 tax on cigarettes			2
in four other states — @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity59 — it is $ 3 extra per pack			0
@entity69 has bolstered its taxes , to 45 cents a pack – despite being a tobacco producing state			0

on average , taxes make up just over 44 percent of the price of a pack nationwide			2

@entity116 has always been one of the cleaner - living states where residents strayed away from smoking			0
even near peak cigarette use in the 1970s , @entity116 residents were smoking 66 packs per capita , the lowest rate in the country			1
today they consume just 23 packs per capita , lower than any state other than @entity59 and @entity80			1
