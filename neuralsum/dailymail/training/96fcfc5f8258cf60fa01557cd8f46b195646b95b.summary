between 1,000 and 2,000 officers have been suspected of tipping off criminals , stealing and fabricating evidence , says a @entity4 report			1
the @entity5 will launch an investigation next month into police corruption after claims officers also used their power to get money and sex			1
the probe comes amid a series of police scandals that have related to recent inquiries involving phone - hacking and the @entity18 scandal			0
a @entity4 report revealed that the government estimate that at least 2,000 officers of all ranks could be corrupt ( file picture ) in a @entity4 report analysis by researchers revealed that the government estimate that up to 2,000 officers of all ranks could be comprimising the police by dealing with criminals			1
the report states that intelligence over a one year period from some forces involved in their research showed that between 0.5 per cent and one per cent of the 200,000 police staff were ' potentially corrupt			1
' it explains : ' corrupt activities across these examples have included the protection of criminals for financial payments , the theft and recycling of drugs to criminals , the stealing of money from crime scenes , and the fabrication of evidence to obtain convictions			1
' it also adds how some officers ' used their powers to obtain money or sexual favours from the public			2
' among the corrupt practices listed by the 2003 report are dealing and using drugs , fraud and domestic violence as well using ' sexist , racist and homophobic behaviour			0
' it also pointed to raids where suspects could have been tipped off because when officers arrived there was no incriminating evidence and they already ' had the kettle on '			2
critics say the 2003 @entity4 report shows why no home secretary @entity71 is trying to tackle historical scandals the report also adds that corruption could be taking place at all levels and suggests that police should be dealt with behind closed doors if they commit crimes , to make it ' less damaging '			1
critics say this @entity4 report shows why now home secretary @entity71 is having to deal with historic police scandals			0
member of the @entity85 and @entity87 mp @entity86 told the @entity88 : ' @entity90 's kid - gloves treatment of the police bred a lack of accountability which ultimately let down the public			2
' there has been a loss of confidence in the police as a result , which is quite dangerous			0
@entity71 is trying to tackle these historic issues to restore the public 's trust			0
' earlier this year , it also emerged that dozens of corrupt police officers helped organised criminals hide evidence , intimidate witnesses and access details of ongoing operations			1
earlier this year , an internal investigation at @entity109 by the @entity110 claimed some officers helped organised criminals to hide evidence an internal investigation by the @entity110 claimed officers were bribed to destroy surveillance logs and some officers even co-owned houses and racehorses with suspected gang leaders			2
the 2002 report , produced as part of @entity121 , an investigation into police corruption , named 80 corrupt officers			1
more than half of them were still serving at the time			0
however , a statement issued by @entity109 said said that the @entity110 continued to investigate corruption , and has ' no complacency ' about the matter			0
policing minister @entity130 told the newspaper : ' the public expect the police to act with honesty and integrity and it is right that the full force of criminal law is available to punish and deter acts of corruption by police officers			0
