animals will finally be classed as living beings after a bill which has been approved by @entity4 mps for hundreds of years they have been given the same legal status as a table or a chair , but now animals will finally be classed as living beings after a contentious bill has been approved by @entity4 mps			1
nearly 700,000 signed a petition against the archaic 1804 law that states that animals are just ‘ movable goods ’			1
the bill describes animals as ‘ living and feeling beings ’			2
it gives @entity4 ’s 63 million pets more protection against cruelty			1
philosopher and former education minister @entity23 signed the petition and said that the @entity26 legislation , which placed animals on the same level as furniture , was ‘ absurd ’			1
he said : ‘ no one has ever tortured a clock			0
' animals suffer , they have emotions and feelings			0
it is not a question of making animals subjects of the law … but simply of protecting them against certain forms of cruelty			2
’ the upgraded status will also mean that couples can fight for shared custody in divorce cases and owners whose pets are run over by a negligent driver will be able to claim compensation for the suffering caused			0
@entity51 , the former trade minister , said that inheritance law would also change to allow owners to leave their fortune to their pets			0
however , the move was denounced as a dangerous attack on the @entity4 way of life by critics who said that it could lead to the end of breeding , hunting , fishing , bull - fighting and the eating of red meat			0
critics also fear that animal rights activists would use the law to challenge slaughter practices on the ground that it is wrong to kill ‘ beings with feelings ’			2
@entity51 , the former trade minister , said that inheritance law would also change to allow owners to leave their fortune to their pets @entity79 , a centre - right mp , said : ‘ agriculture will be threatened , along with wolf culls and … hunting			0
