it is every shopper 's dream - a car that can automatically drop you at your favourite store , go and park itself , and then come to meet you when you 're done			1
car firm @entity6 says its self driving technology , revealed at the @entity8 in @entity9 , could be commonplace in a decade			1
the modified @entity10 was put through its paces in the car park of the @entity13 in @entity9 , ferrying journalists around the cavernous car park			1
it uses sensors on the car and in the car park to drive itself the car is controlled via a special app - and can start itself and come to meet owners at the touch of a button ' imagine you are at a shopping center and you want the car to pick you up , ' said @entity31 , @entity6 senior engineer , told @entity32			1
' that 's exactly what it will do			2
' if i press the pickup button , this car will turn itself on and start driving , and it will stop right in front of your doorstep			1
' the system works using a combination of sensors on the car and car park			1
this allows computer systems in the carpark to tell the car where there are spaces			1
the modified @entity10 parking itself inside a @entity9 hotel @entity6 has unveiled a self - parking car at the @entity56 - and says it can even come and meet owners when they are finished shopping for the @entity9 test , the car only moved in special ' pedestrian free zones ' , but @entity6 is also developing anti collision technology so it could one day be used in a normal car park			1
the firm is among several , including @entity65 , who are developing self driving cars			2
it hopes the technology could be commonplace within a decade			2
@entity70 was named after @entity71 , the first woman to win the race up @entity73 in the @entity74			0
it its latest test , it was pitted against @entity78 , the racetrack ceo and amateur touring class champion - and was faster by 0.4 of a second			1
the team hopes to use the same technology that helps @entity70 navigate around corners to develop collision avoidance systems for normal cars the car giant has also been working with @entity89 scientists have to develop the self - driving robotic car			1
the white @entity91 was last year put through its paces on the @entity93 , north of @entity94 , @entity95			0
the autonomous car raced round the three mile course in two and a half minutes , a time that rivals those posted by professional drivers			1
the affectionately named @entity70 is the result of a collaboration between @entity89 's @entity103 , led by mechanical engineering design graduate @entity104 , and the @entity105 @entity70 navigates the course with the help of an assortment of algorithms			0
the software that tells @entity70 when to brake , how tight to turn , and when to push the pedal to the metal , was tested by @entity104 at @entity93			0
the researchers claim the route @entity70 takes is nearly the same as the one a professional racing driver would take			0
the @entity6 tts is kitted out with antennas and sensors to help it navigate around the track however , despite the autonomous car 's sophisticated technology , it still ca n't quite compete with human - driven equivalents			1
' human drivers are very , very smooth , ' said @entity104			0
@entity70 computes the fastest line around a course and executes the exact corrections required to stick to it			0
a person relies more on feel and intuition , and thus may , for example , allow the car to swing too wide in one turn if he knows it sets him up better for the next			1
' human drivers are ok with the car operating in a comfortable range of states , ' said @entity104			2
' we 're trying to capture some of that spirit			0
' @entity104 and his students will have the opportunity to do just that this weekend at the @entity144 races at the @entity145			0
the group has enlisted two professional drivers to wear a suite of biological sensors as they race around the track			0
graduate research team leader @entity104 shows off the systems carried onboard the autonomous car , a modified @entity91 the sensors will record variables such as the driver 's body temperature and heart rate			2
scalp electrodes will be used to register the driver 's brain activity as they race against other humans to determine which driving maneuvers require the most concentration and brainpower			0
the biological data will be paired with mechanical performance data from the car – a 1966 @entity168 , the only @entity170 - built automobile to finish first overall at the @entity172 race – which @entity89 has kitted out with feedback sensors similar to those on @entity70			1
' we need to know what the best drivers do that makes them so successful , ' said @entity104			0
' if we can pair that with the vehicle dynamics data , we can better use the car 's capabilities			2
' the team believes that the experience and the data they have gained can be used to develop autonomous vehicles for use on public roads			0
in the nearer term , the technology could be used as an onboard co-pilot that helps the driver steer out of a dangerous situation			0
the reality of racing a car round a track and pushing that vehicle to its absolute limit means that it will be subjected to exceptionally high levels of stress			2
the recent tests left poor @entity70 without any brake pads due to the intense heat generated by friction between the tyres and the pads themselves			0
pushing a car to the limit on the racetrack is one of the best ways to find out what type of stress that car is under in a crisis			1
' if we can figure out how to get @entity70 out of trouble on a race track , we can get out of trouble on ice , ' said @entity104 .			0

*driverless* @entity10 can navigate through *multi* storey car parks to find an empty space - then park itself
owners can simply call their car via an app when they are done - and it will come and meet them
