scientists believe a strain of the @entity3 superbug has spread from farm animals to hospitals and baby clinics in the @entity7			1
three samples of the drug - resistant bacteria taken from a hospital and neo-natal unit in @entity13 closely matched a specific strain found in livestock			1
generally , people and animals harbour different forms of the potent @entity3 strain @entity19 investigated by the researchers			2
but the new evidence suggests that the livestock version is capable of being transmitted from animals to humans , and has found its way into hospitals			1

generally , people and animals harbour different forms of the potent @entity3 strain @entity31			2
but the new evidence suggests that the livestock version is capable of being transmitted from animals to humans three samples of the drug - resistant bacteria taken from a hospital and neo-natal unit in @entity13 closely matched a specific strain found in livestock study leader dr @entity40 , from the @entity41 , said : ' our findings emphasise the need for strict biosecurity practices in the food production industry , as well as continued surveillance and infection control of @entity3 in hospitals			1
' responsible use of antibiotics in healthcare settings and agriculture is of utmost importance			0
' @entity3 , or methicillin - resistant @entity55 , is a serious hazard in hospitals and nursing homes			1
the @entity19 strain is known to cause serious and sometimes life - threatening infections in both humans and animals			2
in dairy herds , it has been linked to cases of bovine mastitis			0
dr @entity67 's team unravelled the full genetic codes of @entity7 cc398 samples and compared them with published genetic data on the same bugs from humans and livestock around the world			0
the research showed that the strain had entered the @entity7 on several occasions since the mid- 1940s , but the original source of the bacteria remained unclear			0
the most significant evidence of animal - to - human transmission came from three genetic sequences of @entity3 collected in @entity13			1
the most significant evidence of animal - to - human transmission came from three genetic sequences of @entity3 collected in @entity13			1
two were from samples taken six months apart from a neonatal ward in the @entity87 and @entity88 area			0
file picture two were from samples taken six months apart from a neonatal ward in the @entity87 and @entity88 area			0
the third was obtained from a cleaning project at a @entity87 hospital			0
all three were a genetic match for @entity31 strains in livestock			0
writing in the journal @entity98 , the scientists concluded : ' it is possible that this finding represents the persistence of the livestock - associated strain of @entity19 in hospital settings in the @entity7 , with onward transmission between humans			2
' such a scenario should be investigated with more intensive sampling			0

genetic *fingerprint* study shows strong evidence of @entity3 superbug spreading from farm animals to hospitals
three samples of the drug - resistant bacteria taken from a @entity13 hospital and neonatal unit closely matched a specific strain found in livestock
generally animals and humans harbour different strains of the bacteria
but new evidence suggests the livestock version is capable of spreading from animals to humans
