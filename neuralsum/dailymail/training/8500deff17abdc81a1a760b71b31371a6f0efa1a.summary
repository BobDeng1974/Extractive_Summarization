by @entity0 published : 17:57 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 07:34 est , 26 july 2013 beaming happily , these are the twins who have defied all the odds to celebrate their first birthday today			2
it is a milestone their parents feared they would never see – for @entity7 and @entity8 were born conjoined and owe their lives to the skill of surgeons who separated them			1
their mother @entity13 was 16 weeks pregnant when a scan revealed that the twins were joined			1
double delight : @entity17 , left , and @entity18 , right , were conjoined at their abdomens at birth last year			2
they were separated by surgeons at @entity24 the following day happy : @entity13 and @entity25 hold their daughters @entity17 , left , and @entity7 , right			1
they will celebrate their joint first birthdays today she and her husband @entity29 prepared themselves for the worst after doctors , who at that stage could not tell where the babies were connected , initially gave the girls a low chance of survival			1
conjoined twins occur once every 200,000 births , but two thirds are stillborn or die very soon afterwards			0
@entity7 and @entity17 were delivered early , at 34 weeks , by caesarean section at @entity41 in @entity42			1
weighing 5lb 3oz each , they were joined at the abdomen and shared part of the intestine			1
a life - threatening blockage meant they were transferred to @entity24 the following day for emergency surgery to separate them			2
the operation took five hours and , thanks to the team of 15 doctors and nurses , was so successful that the sisters left hospital just two weeks later			1
as she prepared to celebrate the twins ’ birthday , mrs @entity8 , 32 , said : ‘ when i was pregnant i could n’t see us getting this far			1
complications : @entity7 , left , and @entity17 , right , were born joined at the abdomen and shared part of the intestine proud : their mother @entity13 said she did not think they would ' get this far ' ‘ i was taking each day as it came			1
i am over the moon			0
it ’s so lovely seeing them doing normal things and being happy when you did n’t even expect to have them			0
’ the bond between the girls is so strong they are seldom far from each other ’s side , whether dressed in matching outfits in their double pushchair or crawling around having fun			0
‘ they follow each other round the house crawling			0
they are very close , ’ said mrs @entity18 , of @entity84 , @entity85 , who also has older daughter , @entity86 , five , with her 37 - year - old taxi driver husband			0
‘ they ’re trying to stand up on all the furniture and they ’re playing with toys and taking toys off one another			0
' they ’re very bubbly , very happy , they are very determined , but we knew that from the start really			0
miracle : the operation to separate the twins took five hours and , thanks to the team of 15 doctors and nurses , was so successful that the sisters left hospital just two weeks later ‘ they ’ve never really been apart so i do n’t know whether they ’re inseparable or not but they ’ll play independently and then they ’ll look for one another			1
’ there are clear differences , though			0
‘ @entity17 especially loves her daddy , she ’ll see him and will start kicking her legs and jumping up and down , ’ mrs @entity18 said			0
‘ @entity17 is a daddy ’s girl and @entity7 is more of a mummy ’s girl			2
’ the twins will need regular check - ups throughout childhood , but the hospital is ‘ happy ’ with their progress			2
@entity7 and @entity17 ’s birthday party will be held tomorrow , and for now all their parents have to worry about – apart from putting up the balloons – is persuading family and friends not to bring the girls identical gifts			2
‘ it ’s a bit silly to have two of everything , ’ said mrs @entity18 .			0
