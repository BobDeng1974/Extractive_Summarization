' thirdly , she is begging @entity16 to access emails sent between prosecutor @entity254 and @entity255 for @entity45 @entity256			2

' my insurance only covers a certain amount , ' dr @entity29 told @entity93			1
' now the @entity180 is destroyed			0
quite honestly i do n't have the money so i have to find where she can go that she can be covered			0

however , dr @entity29 is bracing for disappointment as the release of ms @entity295 's report nears			1
