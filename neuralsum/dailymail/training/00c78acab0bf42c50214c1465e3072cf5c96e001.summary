what did you think of @entity11 's @entity8 dress ? miss @entity11 is known to devote months to planning her wardrobe for the series			1
but the dress she chose for the first show of the series on friday night had fans wondering if it was time for a change of stylist			1
the outfit was clearly too tight for her slender frame and became transparent under the glare of the lights , treating those at home to the unflattering sight of her shapewear , which had creased underneath and displayed what appeared to be rolls of flab around her middle			1
viewers tweeted complaints including ‘ @entity11 , fat or pregnant ? # girdle ’ , ‘ can someone please tell @entity11 that the yellow hair , yellow face , yellow dress look on hd is iris destroying ’ and ‘ is @entity11 daly pregnant ? # @entity8 if not sack the stylist ! ’			1

the tv chef ’s performance with @entity98 to the @entity99 drew comparisons with @entity102 ’s memorably bad attempt at the paso doble in 2008			2
the former @entity6 political editor earned the nickname ‘ the dancing pig as he stomped along , dragging partner @entity108 across the floor			0
@entity34 ’ cha - cha , which left him languishing in last place , saw him drag @entity112 in similar fashion			2
judge @entity114 could be seen by millions laughing uncontrollably and told the chef she was strangely in love with him as a result			0
@entity118 looked far from pleased , summing up the 55 - year - old ’s performance as ‘ @entity121			0
i actually recoiled in horror when you came over to the judges desk			0
