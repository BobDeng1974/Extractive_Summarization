@entity0 and @entity1 both found the back of the net for @entity4 but it was not enough as @entity6 inspired @entity7 to victory			1
despite the defeat at @entity11 , it was a good afternoon for @entity4 ’s strikers as @entity13 opted to field two @entity14 ’s in simulations friendlies and as well as @entity0 and @entity1 scoring , summer signing @entity17 netted a hat - trick at @entity19 in a 3 - 0 win			1
@entity4 , who finished 11th in the @entity23 last season , face @entity24 in their season opener in two week ’s time and will have to defend better than they did here if they are to get anything from that game			0

they could opt to stat @entity71 in that game who signed a one - year deal on friday after leaving @entity75 and @entity13 opted to give him a run - out at @entity19			2
@entity6 netted for @entity78 ’s men after @entity44 fired the @entity79 in front after the break and @entity54 scored a goal worthy of winning any match			0
and it was @entity7 got off to the better start with @entity87 testing @entity55 with a looping header in the first minute , then the @entity4 keeper was called into action again when @entity92 shot from the left hand side of the penalty area			1
but @entity4 got back into the game through @entity96 international @entity62 who had two good chances			0
battle : @entity7 's @entity38 controls the ball under pressure from goal scorer @entity0 ( left ) challenge : @entity4 winger @entity61 contests the ball with @entity7 's @entity37 the first was a shot that was deflected wide for a corner and then @entity62 forced @entity36 to make a save at his far post with a good downward header			1
@entity61 then forced @entity36 to make an even better save as the @entity4 man fired a fierce shot from the edge of the area			0
race : @entity4 midfielder @entity63 chases down @entity7 's @entity87 head scratching : @entity4 boss @entity13 despite @entity4 having much go the ball in the @entity7 half , @entity60 showed he was still alert as he cleared a @entity6 ’s first chance of the game off the line after the @entity7 striker lobbed @entity121			1
but if @entity6 thought he was unlucky not to give the lead , he missed the opportunity to make up for it as he put a guilt edge chance over the bar on the stroke of half time when unmarked six yards out			0
but @entity7 did take the lead just after the break when @entity44 turned @entity130 inside out and placed his shot neatly past substitute goalkeeper @entity56			0
@entity6 then made up for his two first half misses with a good finish past @entity56 after beating @entity59 once again to double @entity7 ’s advantage			2
but @entity4 ’s fightback started less than less than a minute later when @entity0 lifted the ball over @entity36 from a yard out			2
and then @entity1 levelled from close distance after @entity36 failed to hold onto @entity63 ’s shot			0
but record singing @entity54 won the game for @entity7 with brilliantly worked goal past @entity56 to give @entity78 ’s men a confidence boost ahead of next week ’s @entity147 opener against @entity149 rivals @entity148 .			0
