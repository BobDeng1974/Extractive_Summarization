published : 07:40 est , 11 february 2014 @entity1 : 07:35 est , 12 february 2014 with long blonde hair , @entity6 breasts and slender figure , @entity2 , 28 , from @entity3 , is could easily be mistaken for @entity8 at first glance			1
and for extreme @entity11 fan @entity2 , that could n't be more of a compliment			1
indeed , so obsessed with the @entity14 star is she , she 's spent 14 years and £ 20,000 on a mission to look more like the blonde actress			1
now , however , she claims she 's an improvement on the star and says that the 46 - year - old actress ought to be flattered to be told she looks like @entity2			1
i grew up with @entity14 and i was captivated by her [ @entity8 's ] look , ' explains @entity2			1
' she 's like an iconic cartoon character in human form			2
' her mission to look more like the star began at the age of 14 , when she dyed her hair blonde and a throwaway comment from her father kickstarted what would become an enduring obsession			1
' i dyed my hair blonde and he said : " oh you do n't half look like @entity8 with your hair that colour " , ' she remembers			1
' and from there , a lot of other people seemed to start saying it			0
' her first surgery swiftly followed , although as @entity2 admits , her quest to become the @entity58 has n't always gone smoothly			1
' i had my first boob job was when i was 20 just to make me feel more confident but unfortunately , it went wrong			1
' i realised after a couple of months that they were n't placed right and one started to go hard			0
' but instead of seeing the doctor , @entity2 ignored the issue and continued to spend plenty of time on the sunbed - with disastrous consequences			1
' i was addicted to having a @entity11 style tan , ' she confesses			2
' at the height of my sunbed use , i would be on it four times a week for up to 16 minutes			0
at times , my skin would feel red raw			0
' the best : @entity2 says she 's also an improvement on the original by virtue of being from @entity3 inspiration : @entity8 , pictured with @entity78 and @entity79 , in her baywatch heyday ' pushing 40 ' : the 46 - year - old actress pictured at a @entity83 charity benefit in @entity84 last month for her breasts , already delicate and dotted with scar tissue because of the implants , the excessive sunbed use proved enormously damaging			1
' i started to see abrasions on one side of the breast and the skin was raw			0
i could see the implant showing on the outside - it had become badly infected			0
' she continues : ' i had complications on my left breast			0
it was infected from the inside out so i had to have the implant removed			0
' for three months , i walked around with only one breast implant			0
it was very strange to me because it was something i 'd never felt before			0
it was was very embarrassing the first time it happened			0
' you do n't want to date someone because you 're basically walking round with one breast			0
' eventually , the infection spread to the right breast as well and she was forced to have the other implant removed			0
' i had to have an operation to remove it , operation to drain it and operation to put it back in ... i had around eight operations in total			2
' but despite the complications , @entity2 says she 's still not satisfied			1
' i 'd like to go a size or two up , ' she admits			0
' then i 'd be happy to maintain that look			0
' ' it 's a full time job to keep looking this good , ' she adds			2
' to be this obsessed with one 's appearance would seem extreme but i am willing to do what ever it takes to maintain that character			0
@entity11 : @entity2 uses her blonde bombshell looks to help her in her career as a @entity8 impersonator on the job : @entity2 in her @entity8 get - up during a paid appearance at a party ' it 's like , i 'm the real @entity8 - that 's what it feels like anyway			1
' despite her efforts , she admits she 's rarely confused with her idol , although she blames that on @entity8 's age			1
' i do n't think i 'll ever be mistaken for the real @entity8			2
i think its a compliment to the real @entity8 that she looks like me know , because she 's pushing 40 ! smiling , she concludes : ' i 'm the world 's best @entity8 lookalike but i 'm one better because i 'm the @entity149 version			1
' the real @entity8 might have something to say about that			2
@entity2 appears on 200 nips and tucks but i want more , tonight at 9pm on @entity155			2

@entity2 , 28 , from @entity3 , has spent £ 20,000 on surgery
has wanted to look like @entity8 since the age of 14
not every operation has gone to plan , including a botched boob job
calls herself the ' @entity11 ' and says she 's better than original
