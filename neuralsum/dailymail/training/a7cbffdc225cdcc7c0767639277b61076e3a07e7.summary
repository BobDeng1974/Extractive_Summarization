@entity0 is the latest buzzword when it comes to colour by @entity4 remember the term ' @entity6 ' ? we reported on it a couple of weeks ago - the bland fashion uniform consisting of plain tees , comfortable shoes , understated anoraks and dad jeans ? just got your fuzzy fashion head around that ? well sorry to break it to you , but it 's already old news in the fast - paced and fickle world of fashion , where buzzwords come and go quicker than you can say @entity24			1
from @entity27 charm and head , to sliders and arm party , @entity25 has compiled a guide to @entity33 's fashion jargon so you do n't get caught out			1
@entity35 : footballer @entity36 has been cited as a key example of someone who is a head - that 's a ' high earner , awful dresser ' - and a new fashion term to drop this season @entity28 is one of fashion writer @entity45 's @entity33 lexicons , as cited on the @entity46 , but what on earth does it mean ? it simply stands for ' high earner , awful dresser ' , she explains			1
she cites @entity36 as the @entity52 , and we think @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 fit the bill , too			1
then there 's @entity27 ( a @entity59 word for estate ) charm , which alludes to the madchester years in the @entity62 , when the @entity27 , situated in @entity63 , was the world 's biggest nightclub - but do n't expect to see any white gloves			1
' the term will evoke floppy wide - brimmed hats , bejewelled earrings and chic little raffia clutches , rather than acid rave and / or house music , ' @entity45 writes			1
oh dear : sorry , @entity54 , left , and @entity55 , right , you are both @entity28 ( high earner , awful dresser ) @entity27 charm : @entity77 is the obvious @entity59 - ista , but look to @entity78 , left , for that tall , @entity59 elegance that oozes sex appeal this season , avoid going over the top a la @entity83 , right , though ' expect to see a lot more of this term as we approach june , and the @entity89 @entity88 - fashion likes to be culturally sensitive , after all , ' she writes			1
' it 's all about @entity59 chic , ' adds fashion writer @entity92			1
' think sexy , hourglass shapes , fishtail dresses , which evoke all the charm of a @entity97 dancer and jangly jewellery that lets people know you are arriving five minutes before they see your face			2
' @entity77 is the obvious @entity59 - ista , but look to @entity78 for that tall , @entity59 elegance that oozes sex appeal			1
' as well as taking inspiration from the stylish @entity59 set , we are also going to be looking further afield to @entity106			2
on - trend : @entity108 , left , has been championing the @entity110 trend lately , while @entity111 introduced orchid at the @entity33 show , right @entity110 , which involves emulating the cowboy style of the 19th century , is wide - leg cropped trousers paired with tailored shirts and coats			0
@entity119 at @entity120 , as well as @entity121 and @entity122 , were the first to set the trend , which has been championed by the likes of @entity108			0
@entity125 joins the party : ' @entity127 ' refers to your ability to mix and match jewellery , like @entity131 if you hear the term ‘ arm party ’ , it means you 're well - accessorised and have the ability to mix and match your bracelets , watches and rings to perfection			2
really want to nail the look ? stacked rings - a la @entity131 - and layered necklaces will do the trick			0
while 2013 was all about the pastel pink , @entity0 is the latest buzzword when it comes to colour			1
every year , @entity148 selects the colour trend for the next 12 months and 2014 welcomed orchid - the only hue to embrace this season			1
too afraid to go all - out ? incorporate the shade into your beauty regime instead by opting for orchid nails and , if you 're feeling more daring , lips			0
then there 's the ' blanket ' - and no , we are n't referring to the itchy kind you use for a picnic			2
@entity111 boss @entity164 was the first to champion that blanket coat this season			0
@entity164 sent out all his models wearing wool blanket ponchos , knitted in muted yellows , reds and blues , patterned in a sort of @entity175 - inspired geometric way , or with @entity177 - style zig zags			0
each one was monogrammed with the initials of the model who wore it ( indeed , front - row fodder @entity183 , who named it as her favourite piece from the show , had her eye on @entity24 's )			2
there were blanket coats , too , and equestrian blanket scarves , which are perfect for the chilly but bright @entity193 summers			0
blankets go couture : @entity164 sent out all his models wearing wool blanket ponchos at @entity111 this season - and we will all be wrapping up like @entity24 , pictured front if she 's doing it , we 're all doing it ! @entity131 , who is always one step ahead of the trends , is already rocking the pool sliders look and has even upped the style ante by pairing hers with sporty striped socks @entity208 was spotted on the streets of @entity210 in a pair of sturdy sandals and grey socks this week as for seasonal footwear staples , if you thought it could n't possibly get worse than vibrant coloured @entity217 and chunky @entity218 , you 're in for a nasty shock because there ’s a new contender for the ugliest shoe in fashion this season			1
say hello to the slider			0
flat and clumpy with an air of the orthopaedic sandal about them , pool sliders are going to be your summer footwear staple , whether you like it or not			1
@entity234 fashion designer @entity119 sent them down the catwalk at her @entity33 show for the luxury label @entity120 and voila , she hot - footed the fash - pack 's favourite trend			2
as we kick off our @entity244 and @entity245 , which have been a winter footwear saviour , quirky pool sliders are slowly but surely saturating the high street			1
two of a kind : @entity249 took the trend one step further when they wore matching sandals and socks at @entity255 's @entity254 in march hot footing a new trend : @entity120 genius @entity119 was the first to send out the quirky footwear at her @entity33 show in @entity261 and now they 're coming to a high street near you known as the ' sad - dad ' look , socks and sandals are making a stylish return , @entity25 reported yesterday , with celebrities such as @entity208 , @entity131 and the @entity271 sisters championing the trend			1
so which style will you be slipping on ? @entity276 slides have a padded strap and look chic in monochrome , while @entity279 are a cult - classic , and are best worn in navy and white			2
looking for something more high - end ? @entity120 or @entity283 are your first port of call and if you 're looking to channel the latest trend on the cheap , head to high street @entity288 or @entity290 , who sell them for under £ 20			2
if you 're still struggling to get your head around the style , there 's worse news ; they are best worn with socks and the sportier the better ( think @entity276 striped numbers )			0
a more pared - back look can be achieved by teaming the sliders with ripped , up - turned jeans and a statement t - shirt			0
which style will you be sporting this summer ? the die - hard fashion fans will be embracing classic styles like the @entity308 , £ 19 ( left ) , while those looking to try the style in a more subtle way will love @entity313 's metallic pool sliders , £ 55 cheap fashion : the best thing about the style is that they 're reasonably cheap - these @entity318 £ 18 , and these classic @entity319 are £ 16 fashion writer @entity92 said : ' once thought of as the footwear choice for @entity322 abroad ( avec awful sports socks ) , pool sliders are here to stay			1
for a while at least			0
' it was @entity326 in his @entity328 collection that took them from hideous to high - end , decorating them with shiny crystals			0
fashion editors rejoiced : " yesss , no more heels for us " , and as much as i recoiled at the sight of flats stomping down a catwalk , there ’s no denying their trend status now			0
' @entity120 ’s furry - lined options are rather amazing , although you would n’t want chlorine - filled water splashing over them			0
@entity348 offer up their take on these flats with buckles and prints , and it was @entity354 who sent down her catwalk possibly the ugliest - yet - most - fabulous sandals for this current season , bejewelled , raised and strappy			0
' but this is the woman who famously said : “ @entity362 is attractive , ugly is exciting			0
” should we be excited by these glorified flip - flops ? i ’ll leave it up to you , lovely reader			0

@entity28 stands for ' high earner , awful dresser ' - yes , that means you , @entity36 , @entity54 and @entity55
@entity27 charm is @entity59 chic , with floppy hats and shapely dresses
known as the ' sad dad ' look , pool sliders are this season 's staple footwear
