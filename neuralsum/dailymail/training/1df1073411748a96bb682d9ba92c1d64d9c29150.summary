by @entity1 reporter published : 22:21 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 06:16 est , 23 january 2014 a mystery that has eluded the family of a @entity6 cancer victim for nearly 20 years is on its way to being solved thanks to internet sleuths			1
on monday @entity10 posted images of two index cards , covered in a seemingly unbreakable code , that her grandmother , @entity14 , had written just weeks before her death in 1996			1
less than 15 minutes later the code was on its way to being solved after a web user spotted a possible method to the madness of jumbled letters			0
mystery : the back of one of the index cards appears to be the first letters of each word of the @entity26 final thoughts : @entity14 wrote the coded index cards before her death in 1996 when she posted pictures of two of the index cards on @entity32 , ms @entity14 , who works at @entity35 in @entity36 , explained her grandmother had lost her ability to speak when she wrote them			1
ms @entity14 said the family had been trying to find meaning in the jumble of letters that covered 20 index cards ever since her grandmother died from a brain tumor			1
' my cousins and i were between 8 - 10 years old at the time , and believed she was leaving us a code			0
we puzzled over them for a few months trying substitution ciphers , and did n't get anywhere , ' she wrote			2
the family 's best guess had been that the letters were perhaps lyrics to songs , but shortly after images of the cards were circulated online , a user known as @entity61 suggested they were prayers			1
after suggesting a sequence of triple as on the card could represent ' @entity66 ' , harperpitt and another user , jessamyn , cracked part of the code , pointing out that the letters matched the @entity26			0
' holy cow ! 14 minutes to solve the back of the card that has been bugging my family for 20 years ! that is amazing ! ' ms @entity14 wrote			1
once the theory behind the letters was revealed , web sleuths set about cracking other parts of the index card , which showed what appeared to be a personal prayer			2
' it was kind of relieving to have an answer , even if we do n’t know what every single word says , ' ms @entity14 said			1
' it ’s nice to know that they were prayers , and kind of gave some insight into what she was thinking and what she was focused on in her last couple weeks			2
' solved : @entity10 says the cards had puzzled her family for years comfort : @entity10 says it was relieving to know what had been on her grandmother 's mind she added that her grandmother hated being in the spotlight ' so she would totally hate all of this [ attention ] , ' but ms @entity105 told @entity106 that she was grateful the mystery had been solved			2
the family had almost forgotten about the cards until ms @entity105 's father found one of them again , sparking the curiosity of what they had meant			2
ms @entity114 was just 11 when her grandmother died			0
@entity114 , who lived in @entity115 , was diagnosed with lung cancer that formed a brain tumor			1
the kindly grandmother , who was married to a @entity120 submariner , ' never flew in a plane and never drove a car ( scared of both ) , and hated having her photo taken , ' she remembered			0
but she was always ready with a stash of coloring books and crayons for when her grandchildren visited , ' ms @entity14 said			1
in her final weeks , @entity14 wrote line after line of capital letters on about 20 index cards , sparking her the curiosity of her grandchildren			1
ms @entity14 said that she , her brother and two cousins - ranging in age from 8 to 12 - spent a few months trying to figure out what the letters stood for , but failed			2
the associate director at @entity35 has offered more details about her family , and gave their initials , in the hope that a message for them may be contained in the prayer			0
hidden message : @entity10 posted this picture of one of her grandmother 's index cards online to see if anyone could break the code ' as for first initials , my family 's show up in one string ( @entity154 is my parents , myself and my brother ) , but no one else seems to			1
her husband 's initial was @entity165 , but he goes by a nickname starting with @entity167 , ' she wrote			0
' her children are @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity172 daughter @entity173 is unmarried with no children			0
her son @entity170 is married to v and has @entity177 as children			0
and her daughter @entity179 is married to @entity180 and has @entity165 as children			0
' a large portion of the card has been solved , but code - breakers are still needed to complete the puzzle			0
