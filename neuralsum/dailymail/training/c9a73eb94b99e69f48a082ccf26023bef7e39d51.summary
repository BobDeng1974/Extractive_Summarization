by @entity0 a glamorous @entity2 fashion designer and former model who triumphed over breast cancer and a double mastectomy has appeared topless in a courageous photoshoot			1
@entity8 , 45 , a mother - of - two from @entity9 , @entity7 beat the disease , which affects one in 8 women in the @entity2 , and decided to proudly reveal her post-operation body , scars and all			1
she was inspired by the @entity15 , a 126 - page book containing 50 portraits of young breast cancer survivors , shot by fashion photographer @entity19			1
brave : @entity8 in one of the topless photos she modelled for in 2012 - two years after her double mastectomy ' he took these amazing documentary type photographs , but i felt it was so sad			1
some were crying , ’ she explains			2
' while it ’s a beautiful project , i did n't want that , i wanted to say " here i am ! " i wanted to do a shoot about how i feel as a person , not what i look like			2
in 2012 @entity8 bravely agreed to appear in a series of black and white photos - shot by renowned photographer @entity34			1
' i realised i did not for one second feel any less of a woman from having my breasts taken away , ’ she said			0
‘ i feel even more of a woman today than ever ! ' i do n't look ( at the photos ) and say , ‘ i wish i had a nipple ’			0
i do n't have nipples and i ’ve got used to looking like a @entity42 doll			0
' despite the pain and heartbreak she suffered during her battle with breast cancer , @entity8 is adamant it has changed her life for the better			1
not missed : @entity8 says she does n't miss having nipples and is relieved to be in remission support : @entity8 , who now lives in @entity52 , with her husband and two small daughters today , the former fashion model – who lived and worked with @entity57 in @entity58 in the 80s - runs her own fashion label while juggling life as a mother and wife			1
she took part in in campaigns alongside @entity66 and @entity57 for @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 , and appeared in @entity70 and @entity71			1
but despite her stylish background , the idea for her own label did n't come about until october 2011 , when , while still in remission , @entity8 organised a fund raising event to raise money for breast cancer charities			1
' i said , " let ’s put on a party ! let ’s make money for breast cancer			1
" so i threw an event for 300 people , and thought it made sense to do a fashion show			0
’ but when she did n’t like what local designers had to offer , she took matters into her own hands			0
with no formal design training , @entity8 made 24 dresses by hand , which appeared on the catwalk and were then sold at auction			1
she adds : ‘ people told me , " you need to do this full time ! " so i did ! ’ in 2012 @entity101 was launched – described on the website as ‘ elegant , comfortable and unique designs with a @entity2 accent			0
’ heyday : @entity8 poses with @entity57 in an 80s editorial shoot in @entity70 looking good : since winning her fight with breast cancer , @entity8 has gone on to become a successful designer important : @entity8 says her topless shoot post breast cancer is the most important she 's ever done ' it ’s for the practical , cheeky and classy woman , who lives life and tells her story through fashion , ' explains @entity8			1
' my label featured in @entity118 – part of @entity120 last year – that never would have happened if i had n’t fought cancer and won			2
' breast cancer gave me this creativity , and now i ’m building a brand i ’m so passionate about			1
' an online store is to come next and @entity128 celebrities such as @entity129 and @entity130 have been spotted in her designs			0
but it has been a long and rocky journey for @entity8 since being diagnosed with breast cancer in november of 2009 aged 40			1
' i had been feeling really , really tired , so i decided to go to the doctors for a check - up , ' she remembers			0
' i ’ve always been healthy , so i knew by the way i was feeling that something was wrong			0
' tests confirmed that her @entity140 levels were dangerously low - a common symptom of cancer			2
@entity8 has a mammogram in december of 2009 , and shortly afterwards , results from a biopsy confirmed she had breast cancer			1
‘ i remember the moment they told me , ’ she adds			0
‘ i was in a clothes store , naked , complaining that i could n’t wear a beautiful , low backed top , because i ’d have to wear a bra			0
and then the doctor rang			0
you drop everything when the doctor calls			0
’ doctors insisted on a lumpectomy to determine whether the cancer had spread			2
the results were unclear , so @entity8 had the mastectomy			1
' i had the choice to have a single mastectomy , ' she said			2
' but i opted for the double mastectomy			1
for me i do n't want to worry psychologically about the other one			0
' despite enduring a five - hour operation to remove her breasts in february 2010 , she opted to have reconstructive surgery just two months later			2
positive : @entity8 , pictured with husband @entity171 ( left ) and in her modelling days , says she feels very lucky ' my husband and i would joke : “ how big shall we go ? ” you have to see the humour , otherwise what ’s the point ? i have no feeling in my nipples at all , that 's a shame			1
i do n't have any nipples			0
' when the doctors asked , “ do you want to keep your nipples ? ” i joked , ' how on earth will i do @entity185 ! ” and then i thought , why the hell would n't i be able to do @entity185 — if i wanted ? why should n’t i stand there with my boobs out and say " i feel incredible " ! ' ' i had cancer the size of a golf ball , and i got through it , with a joke and a smile			2
and i could n’t have got through it without my husband and girls			0
' @entity8 now lives in @entity52 , @entity198 with her husband @entity171 , 36 , a former @entity201 football player turned opera singer and their daughters @entity9 , seven , and @entity205 , six			1
‘ i chose not to hide myself from my girls			0
you just come to realise it wo n’t be like you were before and you move forward			0
' i feel so positive today , ’ she adds			0
‘ if i ’d have waited a year to get the mastectomy , i ’d probably be dead			2
' there are women younger than me who have died because they were n’t as lucky			0
cancer makes you realise that you need to be yourself , be the woman that you want to be			2
i ’m so proud of my photos , the most important photographs of my career			0
