by @entity1 reporter published : 19:05 est , 30 october 2012 updated : 02:42 est , 31 october 2012 taxpayers are forking out £ 113million a year to fund the trade union activities of thousands of civil servants			1
this amounted to £ 92million in paid staff time in the last year , according to research by the @entity8 ’ @entity11 , along with a further £ 21million in direct payments to unions			1
the staff figure is the equivalent of 3,000 public sector employees working full - time for trade unions , in what campaigners described as a ‘ scandalous subsidy ’			1
local government minister @entity20 described the bankrolling of trade union activity under the @entity24 government as ' a very unsubtle way of subsidising @entity26 ( pictured ) and the @entity27 ' the £ 21million is largely paid to train staff for union work through the @entity30			1
the biggest spender is the @entity32 , which shelled out £ 15.5million to the fund			2
the research , published today , suggests that the proportion of public staff working for trade unions may be rising at a time when strikes have crippled public services			1
union duties can include discussing issues such as redundancy and pay or attending activist meetings to organise strikes			0
the @entity32 had the highest number of staff doing union work in the last year , with the equivalent of 272 staff working full - time for trade unions			1
@entity53 had the second highest number with 169 full - time equivalent staff			1
cabinet office minister @entity56 said that ' trade union facility time arrangements in the @entity58 should reflect those in business and the wider public sector ' @entity62 had 70 full - time equivalent staff , the highest figure for a local authority			1
a planned crackdown by the @entity67 on ‘ facility time ’ had to go further than @entity69 and its quangos , the @entity8 ’ @entity11 said			1
spokesman @entity71 said : ‘ thousands of staff who should be working for public services are working for the trade unions instead			2
managers at too many public sector organisations are completely failing in their responsibility to control these costs			0
’ local government minister @entity20 said : ‘ @entity24 millions were taken away from frontline services to bankroll trade union cronies in councils			0
‘ it was a very unsubtle way of subsidising @entity26 and the @entity27 through the back door			0
we are calling time on this closed shop and stopping these non-jobs			0
’ cabinet office minister @entity56 said : ‘ we recognise that trade unions play an important role in the modern workplace			0
but we think trade union facility time arrangements in the @entity58 should reflect those in business and the wider public sector			2
‘ for too long there has been insufficient monitoring of union work done by civil servants during their working hours			0
and some civil servants were able to spend years doing nothing but trade union work			0
that is n’t fair to the taxpayer or other civil servants			0
‘ that ’s why we are limiting the amount of time civil servants can spend on trade union work and introducing a benchmark which will slash the cost of facility time to the taxpayer			2
any exemptions to these arrangements will be reported for all to see and scrutinise			0

research by the @entity11 *revealed* that £ *93million* in paid staff time funded union activities
a further £ 21million was made in direct payments to unions
