by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson ‘ three goalkeepers one problem ’ was the headline on one of @entity4 ’s leading sports papers @entity5 as on friday morning			1
@entity4 want to complete the signing of @entity9 from @entity10 but they already have @entity11 and @entity12			1
over at @entity13 , the rival of @entity14 , a solution was being offered			0
maybe @entity12 could be sold to @entity16 , after all it was @entity18 who signed him for @entity4 in the first place			1
all well and good apart from the fact that @entity16 already have @entity22 and @entity23			1
the surplus of good keepers , along with the stockpiling of talent at most top @entity29 clubs means that @entity22 , @entity30 , @entity11 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity12 , @entity33 and @entity34 could all be sat on the bench for large parts of next season because their clubs also have @entity23 , @entity40 , @entity9 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 to pick instead			1
video scroll dwon to watch @entity44 stranded by @entity46 's chip in limbo : @entity12 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) will have to do battle with the incoming @entity9 under pressure : @entity34 ( left ) and @entity31 ( right ) will have to compete with new arrivals at @entity51 and @entity52 you can argue about the details			1
@entity31 will probably keep his place ahead of @entity56 ( although believing that to be a formality is to ignore how @entity56 has been among the top three goalkeepers in @entity60 in each of the last three seasons )			1
likewise @entity11 might keep his place ahead of @entity62			2
and @entity34 could well fend off @entity64 ’s challenge			2
but however the chips fall there will be a lot of very good keepers not playing regularly			0
@entity69 were expected to ease the congestion by signing one of the surplus stoppers but they opted instead for another young talent – @entity81 the 21 - year - old @entity75 - so there are still too many keepers for the places available and the way the @entity79 was dominated by goalkeepers has done nothing to change that			0
@entity85 ’s @entity84 has earned a move to @entity87 after his performance against @entity89			0
and after finishing third in @entity93 ’s @entity92 rating @entity90 moved to @entity94			0
@entity32 ’ injury ruined his proposed move to replace @entity90 at @entity97			0
the @entity99 club could yet offer @entity12 a way out of @entity4			2
uphill battle : @entity23 ( left ) and @entity30 ( right ) will have to dislodge @entity22 and @entity40 settling for no 2 status is one alternative open to him and maybe , if @entity22 were to move to @entity105 , @entity12 could end - up as @entity23 ’ stand - in at @entity16			1
but experienced number twos only served to block the progress of young keepers – the highly rated @entity110 now finds his path to the first team blocked by @entity41 and @entity33 at @entity113			0
and the senior goalkeepers themselves invariably suffer			0
coaches and directors of football might say that is just part of the modern game – top clubs need two first - team keepers			2
but the performances of @entity11 in the @entity29 final and @entity79 after a season on the bench during @entity4 ’s league campaign suggest it does n’t exactly improve personal performance			1
most goalkeepers believe they have to be playing every week to reach top form			2
that ’s why @entity9 was not interested in a move to @entity135 where he would have spent most of this time watching @entity136			0
it may yet convince him to turn down @entity4 though his chances of dethroning @entity11 in the near future are better than they would have been of ousting @entity136			1
the musical chairs continues – and with ever fewer chairs			0
the world 's greatest : @entity135 and @entity143 keeper @entity136 proved his credentials at the @entity79			0

@entity4 *captain* @entity11 faces competition to start in goal from @entity12 and *imminent* arrival @entity9
follows trend of top @entity29 clubs stockpiling goalkeepers
@entity52 have signed @entity42 to compete with @entity31
@entity155 no 1 @entity43 *joined* @entity51 to challenge @entity34
@entity30 's @entity158 future is *uncertain* behind @entity40
@entity23 has returned from loan to challenge @entity22
