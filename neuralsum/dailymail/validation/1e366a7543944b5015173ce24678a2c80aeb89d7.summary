@entity1 @entity0 senator @entity0 will release a book this summer designed to boost his political bona fides in the early stages of the 2016 presidential campaign			1
' a @entity6 : reigniting the miracle of @entity8 ' will go on sale june 30 , joining a raft of other political books penned by other @entity0 for the same reason			2
@entity0 inked a deal with @entity14 , a division of @entity14 , last year for a reported $ 1.5 million advance			1
that would pale in comparison to former secretary of state @entity19 's $ 14 million contract , but signals the publishing industry 's eagerness to cash in as political books become more like campaign commercials than memoirs			1
now an author : sen. @entity0 , shown on march 2 , will likely rail against executive overreach , open borders and the threat of a nuclear @entity30 in his book due out in june disappointing : @entity19 's memoir made a giant splash in 2014 but sales were well below what her publisher expected for a $ 14 million advance @entity0 , a first - term lawmaker , told the @entity38 in a recent interview that in a time of ' extraordinary challenges ' he wants to tell his story and share his message of free markets and constitutional liberties			1
' men and women are frustrated with career politicians in both parties who are not listening to them , ' @entity0 told the @entity38 , adding that the themes of a possible @entity52 candidacy are ' certainly reflected in this book			2
' @entity0 , a favorite among tea party activists who has battled with @entity57 and members of his own party , also said he wants to counter the ' caricatures ' of the right as ' stupid , ' ' evil ' or ' crazy			1
' ' the image created in the mainstream media does not comply with the facts , ' he said			0
he said that ' a @entity6 ' will include vignettes about @entity67 , @entity68 and others who ' had the courage ' to speak out even at risk to themselves , a theme he acknowledged can be found in a famous work by a future president , then - sen. @entity76 's ' @entity75			0
' the vignettes draw upon ' an aspect of what @entity76 did ' in his book , @entity0 said of ' @entity75 , ' a tribute to @entity8 senators who took stands unpopular within their own party			2
a bipartisan field of possible 2016 candidates will have books on store shelves by the time any primary debates happen			0
former @entity90 ceo @entity89 will unveil ' rising to the @entity91 : my @entity92 ' on may 5			2
three weeks later @entity94 , a @entity0 senator from @entity95 , will release ' taking a stand : moving beyond @entity97 to unite @entity8			1
' retired neurosurgeon @entity98 is waiting until october 6 to introduce ' @entity99 : what @entity100 can do to @entity102			0
' a few @entity0 hopefuls have already put their political books out this year , including former @entity106 gov. @entity105 with ' @entity107 , and @entity108 ' and @entity110 's ' @entity109 : restoring @entity111 for everyone			1
' @entity114 gov. @entity113 released ' @entity115 : a governor 's story and a @entity91 ' in august 2014 , and former @entity119 sen. @entity118 published ' blue collar conservatives : recommitting to an @entity121 ' four months earlier			2
@entity98 , who made headlines this week for saying homosexuality is a ' choice ' and pointing to prison life for evidence , is the most prolific writer among the likely @entity0 candidates with eight books to his name already , including four released by the @entity131 publisher @entity132			2
cottage industry : by the time presidential primary debates begin , at least 10 likely candidates – including former @entity106 gov. @entity105 – will have their names on book jackets former @entity140 gov. @entity139 , the fundraising standout among @entity0 in the early going , published his most recent book , ' @entity143 , ' in 2013			1
on the @entity57 side , @entity145 's ' @entity144 ' came out in the summer of 2014 to great fanfare but disappointing sales			2
at one point the @entity149 declared that it was ' bombing			0
' her publisher , @entity154 , printed 1 million copies but sold just 161,000 in the first three weeks , a critical marketing period , according to @entity157			0
that number was still under a quarter - million by august			0
@entity159 , seen as a far - left alternative to @entity145 if her star should fade , released her own book ' @entity162 ' in april 2014			0
@entity0 's book is scheduled for a june 30 release that book sold fewer than 72,000 copies in its first four months			1
it remains to be seen how @entity0 's book will perform , but sales are n't the only motivation for politicians to become authors			1
the free publicity is one			0
book - signing appearances can take on the flavor of campaign stump speeches , with publishers – not campaign coffers – often footing the bill			0
@entity0 's campaign referred @entity180 to @entity14 for comment			1
a publicist at the company would n't comment on the content of the book , describing it as ' under embargo ' and saying there would be no advance copies sent to reviewers before the book is finalized and printed			0
but the book 's pre-order page on @entity194 , which still describes it as ' unti ' – for ' untitled ' – includes a preview from the publisher			1
' liberals love to hate @entity0 , ' it reads in part			1
' the outspoken @entity201 has a knack for getting under their skin			0
' ' since his election to the @entity207 in 2012 he has refused to go along with the established way of doing business in @entity210			0
as a result , he has become a voice for millions of @entity8 frustrated with governmental corruption and gridlock			0

@entity0 says he wants to counter ' caricatures ' of conservatives as ' stupid , ' ' evil ' or ' crazy '
@entity94 and @entity89 also have book launches scheduled for the summer
@entity105 and @entity110 released theirs earlier this year
@entity0 's reported $ 1.5 million book advance is a serious figure but nowhere near the $ 14 million @entity19 was paid for her memoir
