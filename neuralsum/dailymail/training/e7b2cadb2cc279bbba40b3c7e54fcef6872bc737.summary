former @entity1 midfielder @entity0 has been ' upset ' by some of the criticism aimed at @entity4 this week			1
@entity4 did not start @entity1 's @entity6 qualifying win in @entity7 on sunday after telling manager @entity8 that he felt tired			1
@entity8 's decision to make this conversation public has prompted a huge debate , with the player himself having both his fitness and commitment questioned in some quarters			2
@entity0 says criticism of @entity4 ( in action here against @entity7 ) has been unfair @entity19 star @entity0 says he is ' upset ' at the backlash against @entity21 after the teenager and his @entity24 team - mate told @entity1 boss @entity8 he was tired ahead of the match against @entity7 @entity0 feels it is unfair to turn on the 19 - year - old , who is still early in his career and still to develop physically			1
@entity0 , a team - mate of @entity21 's at the @entity24 last summer , told @entity30 : ' i think he is actually quite a brave boy to say , " you know what i am not quite at my best here "			1
' i am actually quite upset , not with the manager as such , but that the aftermath has been a lot of people criticising @entity4 - who is probably in the top two or three players in our country and we need him to be at his best - for making quite a brave decision			1
' i think we need to get behind him			0
whether it is right or wrong , i do n't know , but we are all individuals and he made that call			0
' one accusation thrown at @entity50 forward @entity4 , who has become a key player for club and country over the past year , is that he is a well - paid professional , and therefore should be fit			1
@entity0 does not see how that argument is relevant			2
the veteran midfielder said : ' i would take the money out of it			0
that is easily said and i hate it when money gets drawn into things , in terms of " because he is getting paid ( this ) he should act like this "			0
@entity4 ( right ) did n't start the @entity6 qualifier but earned the free - kicked that led to the winning goal @entity0 commended 19 - year - old @entity4 's bravery in telling @entity8 he was tired ' the fact is , when that 's is your job , when you are doing it regularly , you have to make calls			1
i think @entity4 made a judgement call on that game alone			2
' hopefully he will get 100 caps and be very successful for @entity1			2
' but @entity0 , who was invited to speak to a live audience as part of a @entity30 report into the price of football , does think the game has an issue in terms of the wages being paid to unproven youngsters			2
@entity21 may now be established at elite level and worthy of reward , but @entity0 feels many others in their teens are not			0
the 36 - year - old said : ' it is one of my pet hates in football at the minute , the wages we are giving out to boys who have n't quite made it , who have n't got to the top level where they are performing and entertaining at the top level			1
@entity4 ( left ) speaks with @entity8 ( right ) at @entity105 in @entity106 ahead of the @entity7 clash @entity0 says of @entity21 : ' hopefully he will get 100 caps and be very successful for @entity1 ' ' i think we are maybe giving very big wages to young players who maybe are n't quite ready for it , and who ca n't handle it			1
' @entity0 himself is currently on loan at @entity19 from their sister club @entity116 after being released by @entity118 last summer			1
he is due to move to the @entity119 early next year to begin preparations for the 2015 @entity122 season , but his form at the @entity124 has led to suggestions his loan could be extended			0
@entity0 insists there is nothing to report on that front			0
he said : ' i am contracted here until january			0
i am enjoying every minute of training at this level and being able to get game time			0
that is as far as it goes at the moment			0
' speculation has come because of a couple of goals , but at the moment there is nothing to be said			0

@entity0 said he was ' upset ' by criticism of @entity4
@entity4 told @entity1 manager @entity8 he was tired before @entity7 match , and subsequently did n't start the match
@entity0 said it was brave of the 19 - year - old to be honest with @entity8
@entity0 was a team - mate of @entity4 's at the @entity24 in @entity153
the @entity19 loanee said money is no factor in the issue
