modern scouts learn to ‘ be prepared ’ for adult life and it seems that little has changed in almost 2,000 years			2
ancient papyri show that wealthy @entity5 children were enrolled in a youth organisation in order to learn to be good citizens too			1
the documents , which originate from @entity10 in @entity11 , also reveal that poorer children and even slaves became apprentices , while girls remained at home			1
ancient papyri show that wealthy @entity5 children ( illustrated in this @entity18 from late antiquity rising on a camel ) were enrolled in a youth organisation called a gymnasium in order to learn to be good citizens			1
it was the @entity5 equivalent of the scouts historians @entity27 of the @entity28 and @entity29 of the @entity30 , are working through 7,500 ancient documents discarded in @entity32 in @entity10 , which had 25,000 inhabitants			1
the documents are thought to be around 2,000 years old			2
the town was home to @entity11 's most important weaving industry and the @entity5 administrative centre for the area			1
from 1890 onwards , archaeologists have discovered a great deal of papyri after stumbling across an ancient rubbish heap			1
the documents , which originate from @entity10 in @entity11 , ( marked on this map ) also reveal that poorer children and even slaves became apprentices , while girls remained at home the @entity10 papyri are a group of manuscripts discovered in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by archaeologists including @entity56 and @entity57 at an ancient rubbish dump near @entity10 in @entity11			1
they date from the first to sixth centuries @entity32			0
the collection includes thousands of @entity62 and @entity63 documents , letters and literary works			2
among the text found at the site are fragments of plays and early non-canonical gospels as well as early @entity72 hymns , prayers and letters			0
discarded receipts and administrative documents are giving experts a glimpse of the social , economic and political life of the ancient world			1
their ordinariness makes such documents a treasure trove for social historians			2
the historians are combing through the texts , which include personal letters and administrative documents , to study what childhood was like for people at the time			1
they have discovered that boys born to wealthy @entity95 , @entity62 and @entity5 families joined the @entity5 equivalent of @entity97 – a youth organisation called the gymnasium			1
the boys would have belonged to the ' 12 drachma tax class ' and dr @entity27 thinks that between 10 and 25 per cent of the town ’s population would have belonged to this class			0
however , girls were not allowed to join			2
the boys would have learned skills to make them model citizens at the gymnasium			0
he told @entity109 that the gymnasium was a place that was originally used as a sports centre for wrestling and running , as well as weapons training			0
but evidence of this was not found in @entity11			1
' it seems that it was maybe more a place for socialising and learning in general than a sports facility as such - and even less a place to practice for war			0
in the gymnasium the boys ideally developed " a sound mind in a sound body , " by the help of their teachers and coaches of sports			0
' simultaneously they learned a lifestyle proper to their privileged class , with " classical " @entity134 learning - called paideia - learning skills and proper ways to serve their city			0
and what was important they made connections among themselves for their future life			0
dr @entity29 added : ' children of the urban elite would attend the gymnasium and learn how to be good citizens , in part through sports and athletic games in a very classical tradition - one document tells us about match - fixing in a boys ' wrestling match ! ' it was different from schools because the focus was less on reading and writing , and more on growing up to conserve the values of a particular social group with a very distinct heritage in the city			1
' even when children did learn reading and writing , they would be reading the great classical @entity62 poets like @entity165 and @entity166			2
' historians are combing through papyri ( pictured ) , which include personal letters and administrative documents , to study what childhood was like for people at the time this papyrus sheds light on living conditions for children living with grandparents in @entity10 less wealthy children typically started working before their teens and may have served an apprenticeship for between two and four years – likely in the weaving industry			1
the historians know this because they found 20 apprenticeship contracts in @entity10			2
males were not considered to be adults until they married in their early 20s , while girls stayed at home to learn the skills needed to become a good wife			1
dr @entity27 said : ‘ we have found only one contract where the apprentice was a girl but her situation was a little unusual - she was not only an orphan but also had her deceased father 's debts to pay			2
’ interestingly , slave children could also become apprentices and they were given the same type of contracts as free - born citizens			1
while apprentices may have given slave children prospects , life was hard for slave children in @entity11			1
documents reveal that they tended to live with their masters and could be sold and separated from their parents when they were just two years old			2
in one letter , a man encourages his brother to sell the youngest slave children and some wine , while promising to spoil his nephews			1
it reads : ‘ … i am sending you some melon seeds and two bundles of old clothes , which you can share with your children			0
’ few records document the lives of very young children , but it seems that they began doing light work between the ages of seven and nine when they may have looked after goats and collected wood or animal dung for fuel			2
there were probably a good number of children who did not live with their biological parents , because the mortality rate was high			0
dr @entity27 said : ‘ it 's like putting together a jigsaw puzzle			0
by examining papyri , pottery fragments with writing on toys and other objects , we are trying to form a picture of how children lived in @entity11			1
’ the researchers have created a blog detailing translations and findings of the papyri as they are studied			0
one particular papyri - pictured above , right - sheds light on living conditions and housing in @entity10			1
in the document , @entity259 is writing to petition the local police magistrate complaining that he has been treated with insolence and assaulted by a woman named @entity264 , the wife of @entity265 the cook , when staying in his home			0
it seems from this petition that @entity264 came in , insulted and physically struck him , and then shouted at his daughter ’s sons			0
in a blog post , the researchers say that the document raises lots of questions , such as how common it was for grandparents to raise children and where the parents were			0
the translation is as follows : ‘ @entity284 , of the police magistrates , from @entity286 [ --- ] @entity287 , former exhibitor of games in the city of the @entity291			0
' yesterday evening a certain @entity264 , the wife of @entity265 , the cook , passing my house and finding me standing there with our family , treated us with insolence , using speakable and unspeakable expressions - a woman abundantly furnished with the utmost shamelessness and effrontery			0
' thereupon , when i stopped her , advising her to keep off from us , she leapt upon me , and , being distracted in her senses , even stretched out her hands and smote me , and railed furiously at some of my daughter 's sons , whom i called to witness , and not only at them , but even at one of the officials of our city who was present			0
' having suffered so much , i , the victim of the assault , deliver to you this petition , asking you to give orders that she shall be brought before you , so that i may experience your beneficence toward all men			0

experts from the @entity28 and the @entity30 are studying papyri to learn more about childhood in @entity5 times
ancient documents were discovered in @entity10 in @entity11
they reveal rich children attended a youth organisation called a gymnasium
poorer children went out to work and did apprentices in the textile industry
slave children received the same type of apprentice contract as free children
girls stayed at home to learn *domestic* chores , but there were *exceptions*
