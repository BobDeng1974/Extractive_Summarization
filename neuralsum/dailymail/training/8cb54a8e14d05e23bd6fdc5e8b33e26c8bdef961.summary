prize - winning author @entity0 has courted controversy again by claiming the poor were treated better centuries ago than under @entity3			1
the historical writer said a ‘ mood of harshness ’ had taken over @entity5 and those in poverty were now portrayed as ‘ morally defective ’ by the @entity8			1
the 62 - year - old sparked outrage last year when she said the @entity12 was a ‘ plastic princess ’ and ‘ born to breed ’			1
prize - winning author @entity0 has courted controversy again by claiming the poor were treated better centuries ago than under @entity3 she also recently attracted criticism after penning a short story about the @entity17 murdering @entity18			1
and in an interview to promote the @entity21 - language version of the story this week , she said the @entity23 had more of an advanced view than @entity5 today on how the needy should be treated			1
she said : ‘ when people feel they ’re being mistreated , they lash out against people who are weaker than themselves , immigrants for example			2
what ’s happening here at the moment is really ugly			0
’ she told @entity21 newspaper @entity34 : ‘ the government portrays poor and unfortunate people as being morally defective			1
this is a return to the thinking of the @entity39			0
‘ even in the 16th century , @entity40 was trying to tell people that a thriving economy has casualties and that something must be done by the state for people out of work			0
‘ even back then , you saw the tide turning against this idea that poverty was a moral weakness			0
who could have predicted that it would come back into style ? ‘ it ’s myth making on a grand scale , and it ’s poisonous			0
’ @entity0 , who was awarded the @entity59 twice for @entity60 – an account of the rise of @entity63 ’s confident @entity40 – and its sequel , @entity65			1
she said : ‘ many people are poorer than they were five or six years ago			1
the last few years of austerity after the banking crisis have opened up a wider gap between rich and poor			1
@entity71 mp @entity70 ( pictured ) dismissed the author ’s ' extraordinary ' claims as fiction ‘ what ’s put to the electorate is : you ca n’t have this , you ca n’t have that , because there ’s no money in the pot. but it ’s not really a question of resources			2
it ’s a question of ideology , which is moving to the right			0
it wishes to reduce the role of government and it strives for a small state			0
’ she also told the @entity21 paper that her comments on @entity12 had been taken out of context , and she said the prime minister ’s criticism of her that followed was ‘ unwise ’			1
she said : ‘ he was misguided in being rushed into comment about something he knew nothing of			0
’ and she defended her recent short story on the murder of @entity18 – which prompted outrage and even calls for a police investigation from some quarters			2
she said : ‘ i was prepared , but bringing in the police for an investigation was beyond anything i could have planned or hoped for , because it immediately exposes them to ridicul			0
‘ these people do n’t know how to read fiction , they were professionally outraged			0
i do n’t know if the reactions would have been the same if a male writer like @entity116 or @entity117 had published this			2
‘ i do n’t need a defence , but what i would ask them is : do you think ms @entity18 shied away from controversy ? do you think she cared overly much about public opinion ? ‘ @entity18 was the first woman in @entity126 , but imitated a man			0
when i say this , it seems like a joke , but i think @entity18 had a great deal of trouble understanding and coming to terms with her own femininity			0
’ but @entity71 mp @entity70 dismissed the author ’s ' extraordinary ' claims as fiction			2
the @entity138 said : ‘ with more people working than ever before and unemployment lower than it was before the last election it beggars belief that ms @entity0 make this claim - like a @entity147 historian she does n’t let the facts ruin her storyline			1
