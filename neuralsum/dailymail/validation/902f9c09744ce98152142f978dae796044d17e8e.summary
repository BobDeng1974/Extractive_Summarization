when @entity0 was surprisingly chosen to host @entity2 ’s top chat show , fans and critics alike wondered if the @entity6 star would flourish in such an unfamiliar role			1
yet @entity0 ’s first week in the hot - seat on @entity10 ’s @entity9 has been so widely acclaimed that he is now being tipped as a front - runner to host the prestigious @entity13 awards next year – the @entity15 party second only to the @entity16 for star quality			1
‘ out of nowhere , he ’s suddenly a realistic contender for one of the most coveted awards - hosting jobs of the year , ’ said a source close to the @entity13			1
‘ he ’s only been hosting the @entity9 for a few days , but already @entity15 is sitting up and taking notice			1
‘ if he maintains this trajectory , he could find himself hosting the @entity13 – and that would really cement his position in @entity15			0
’ @entity0 , 36 , who made his name as co-writer and star of cult television sitcom @entity39 , has already proved his ability to host a major awards show by fronting the @entity43 for four years			2
if he took on the @entity13 , he would be following in the footsteps of fellow comedy actor @entity45 , who hosted the ceremony from 2010 to 2012			1
since @entity45 stepped down , the awards have been co-hosted by @entity2 tv comedy stars @entity49 and @entity50			2
comfortable : ‘ @entity0 has shown that he ’s funny , can sing and dance , puts celebrities at their ease , ' said a source			2
pictured with @entity54 and @entity55 on his second night a source within the @entity57 , which stages the @entity13 , said : ‘ @entity50 and @entity49 have finished their three - year contract and have stated that they wo n’t be back next year			1
‘ right now , the field for a new @entity13 host is wide open			0
’ another insider said : ‘ @entity0 combines all the attributes of the ideal host			1
‘ he has enjoyed movie success this year , starring in @entity67 with @entity68 , and of course he ’s had tv success in @entity6 with his comedies			2
‘ he ’s also won a @entity72 for his @entity73 show @entity74 , and now he ’s getting rave reviews in the @entity76 with the @entity9 , giving him an international audience			1
’ while there are a string of chat show hosts who are better known in @entity2 , such as @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 , none has @entity0 ’s wide range of film , tv and stage success			0
@entity0 ’s guests during his debut week included actors @entity27 , @entity26 , @entity94 , @entity55 and @entity95			0
celebrities lined up for future shows include @entity99 tycoon @entity98 , footballer @entity100 , chef @entity101 and actors @entity102 , @entity104 and @entity105			0
but not everyone might welcome @entity0 as the @entity13 host			0

@entity114 , president of the @entity57 , said : ‘ we are exploring some very exciting possibilities regarding hosts			0
