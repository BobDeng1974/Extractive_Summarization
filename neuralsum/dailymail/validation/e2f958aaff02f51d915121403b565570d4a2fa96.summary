what appears to be the same blue car had been linked to the attacks in which a gunman opened fire on a driver at a mall , a @entity13 , a movie theater , a truck on a highway and headquarters of the @entity18 over the last seven days			1
if the same gunman is behind all the attacks , it would be a case with chilling similarities to the @entity25 attacks of 2002 when @entity26 and @entity27 killed ten people with gunfire from a hidden firing spot in the back of their blue @entity33 sedan			1
early morning reports on wednesday revealed that a suspect was in custody who was believed to be involved in the shootings that occurred since last tuesday in the @entity41 - @entity40 metro area , according to the @entity42			1

that same day , a cleaning crew staff member reportedly heard gunshots around 5.10am at the @entity96 at @entity97 in @entity98			2

the attack left both passengers with non-life - threatening injuries leaving one injured from shattered glass and one bruised from a bullet fragment blocked by his clothing , according to the @entity42			0
the surveillance video has captured the car ( above ) but a license plate has not been determined nor has a clear identity of the shooter only 12 miles away from the shooting on the @entity99 , an attack involving the @entity18 in @entity100 ( above ) occurred where several gunshots struck one of its office buildings around 5pm			1

no injuries to @entity18 personnel were reported , a spokesperson for the @entity18 told @entity144			2
@entity44 spokeswoman sgt. @entity150 said that the @entity18 reported damage to one of its buildings close to the @entity41 - @entity154 on tuesday			1
at the time , she said it is too early to determine whether the damage is related to the report of gunfire nearby			0
investigators are looking into whether one gunman is tied to the five incidents spread across three different @entity4 counties : @entity80 , @entity82 's and @entity83			0
ballistic evidence has also suggested a possible link between the shootings , two anonymous sources told the @entity45 the @entity166 is coordinating the multi-jurisdiction investigation as it continues			2
the back - to - back shootings in @entity4 on tuesday sparked flashbacks to 2002 , when a sniper , @entity26 ( left ) and his 17 - year - old accomplice @entity27 ( right ) terrorized the @entity40 area in a series of seemingly random shootings back - to - back shootings in @entity4 on tuesday sparked flashbacks to 2002 , when a sniper terrorized the @entity40 area in a series of seemingly random shootings			1
ten people were killed and three injured in the 14 october shootings which authorities eventually connected to two perpetrators working in tandem			0
shooter @entity26 and his 17 - year - old accomplice @entity27 started their spree in february 2002 , with murders in @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196			0
that cross-country spree resulted in the deaths of seven people and left seven injured			0
it was only in october though that the murders became more targeted on the @entity202 and @entity4 areas immediately surrounding @entity40 - earning the name the beltway sniper attacks			2
the attacks left @entity40 residents afraid to leave their homes for weeks , since the nature of the shootings were random , and the shooter fired from a distance and never confronted his victims face to face			1
but @entity26 apparently grew tired of the anonymity and started leaving behind objects at the crimes scenes including a @entity219 card inscribed with the phrase ' call me @entity222 '			0
@entity26 and @entity27 's reign of terror was finally brought to an end on october 24 when they were found sleeping in a car in @entity228 , @entity4 and taken into custody			0
the following september , @entity26 went on trial for his crimes and was sentenced to death			0
his accomplice @entity27 testified at his trial saying the two planned to shoot six people a day for 30 days - though that plan failed			0
when @entity27 went on trial , his attorneys painted him as being under the influence of @entity26 and therefore not as equal a partner in their crimes , which is perhaps the reason he received a lesser sentence of life in prison without parole			0
@entity26 was executed by lethal injection on november 10 , 2009 .			0
