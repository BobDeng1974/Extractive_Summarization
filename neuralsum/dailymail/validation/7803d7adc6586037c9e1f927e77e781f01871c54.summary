i wanted to share my own experiences			0
' for other people , it 's good to have someone who 's been though it before and ask questions			2
' so far , her @entity15 blog has attracted about 20,000 followers			1
another ad found by @entity0 , from @entity8 in @entity9 , which used her photo without permission the 21 - year - old has spent three years , exercising and devising eating plans , to lose a total of 57 kilograms but her well - documented progress was twisted by online advertisements , who started using photographs of her dramatic transformation without her permission , to promote dieting pills which promised to ' erase 13 kilos of belly fat in four weeks '			1
it was claimed ms @entity0 had used dieting pills to achieve her new look			1
she had not been aware of the unauthorised use of her image until friends started tagging her and strangers made contact with her about the drugs she had allegedly used for her weight loss			0

' often , attractive people or celebrities are used to sell the products			0
