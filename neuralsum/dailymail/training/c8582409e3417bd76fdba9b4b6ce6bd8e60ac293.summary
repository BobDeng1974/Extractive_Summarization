by @entity0 published : 10:54 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 19:12 est , 7 august 2013 @entity1 has applied for trademarks for a ‘ smartwatch ’ that connects to the internet and can make phone calls			1
the @entity7 company is racing against its rival @entity8 to deliver the first watch that can surf the internet and make calls			1
trademark applications in the @entity12 and @entity7 describe the ‘ @entity18 ’ as a wearable digital electronic device in the form of a wristwatch , wrist band or bangle			1
it has a flexible display that curves around three quarters of the device			0
a trademark application to the @entity12 patent office , pictured , has confirmed @entity1 is working on a wearable device worn on a user 's wrist			1
the filing affirms the company is working on a smartwatch - style device and that it will be called the @entity18 the first so - called smartwatch to become a mainstream product was the @entity33 that launched via a @entity35 campaign			2
it let users sync their phones to a wrist - worn device and receive notifications from @entity41 , @entity42 as well as texts and emails without getting their phone out of their bag			1
rumours then emerged that @entity8 was working on what 's been dubbed @entity49 after a number of patents were filed suggesting it was looking to develop wearable technology			2
@entity54 became the world 's first fully - featured smartwatch earlier this year and comes with a 2 - inch screen and runs the @entity59 operating system			0
@entity60 announced its @entity61 2 in june but this device works in a similar way to the @entity33 and not a fully - featured device			2
rumours about a @entity1 smartwatch began following a patent filing in june that suggested the device would be called @entity69			1
this latest filing confirms that the name will be @entity18 and it will be a wearable device capable of making and receiving calls			1
apart from replicating the services of a smartphone , it could also serve as a health monitor			0
the device is also being rumoured to launch at an upcoming @entity79 event on 4 september			0
according to the filing , originally discovered by @entity84 fan site @entity82 , @entity1 's @entity18 range will be ' wearable digital electronic devices in the form of a wristwatch , wrist band or bangle capable of providing access to the @entity91 and for sending and receiving phone calls			1
' it continues that the wristband will also be used for ' storage and / or transmission of data and messages and for keeping track of or managing personal information ; smart phones ; tablet computers ; portable computers			0
' this latest filing follows one previously submitted in june by @entity1 that described the smartwatch as a @entity69 , rather than @entity18			0
the @entity82 addition to the name would mean the device would fit in with @entity1 's existing range of @entity59 - powered @entity82 smartphones			1
invites to @entity1 unpacked event at this year 's @entity113 conference in @entity114 on 4 september have begun being sent out to journalists			0
@entity1 could use this event to launch the smartwatch as well as a new @entity118 phablet - a cross between a phone and a tablet			2
@entity1 announced earlier this month it is ' investing heavily ' in wearable computers and revealed it is even developing systems for stick on patches to monitor health			2
@entity1 's watch concept , pictured , shows a solid wooden band , and the watch face can be simply slipped out and put in a pocket when running , for example @entity60 announced its @entity61 2 in june but this device is classed as a ' phone remote ' worn on a wearer 's wrist rather than a full smartwatch with its own operating system			1
the @entity61 2 syncs with any @entity59 phone and shows notifications on a small screen attached to a wristband			0
@entity1 was expected to launch a smartwatch at an event in @entity144 last month but instead just confirmed it was ' investing heavily ’ in wearable computers			1
the company also revealed it is developing systems for stick on patches to monitor health			0
@entity60 announced its @entity61 2 in june but this device , pictured , is classed as a ' phone remote ' worn on a wearer 's wrist rather than a full smartwatch with its own operating system			2
@entity1 's @entity18 is expected to be a fully - featured smartwatch running @entity59 ‘ eventually you wo n’t even know you ’re wearing the device , it could be the fabric in your clothing , your glasses or your watch , ’ @entity1 ’s chief strategy officer , @entity158 , told the @entity160 conference			1
‘ in three or four years , the number of people wearing computers will increase dramatically , ’ mr @entity167 added and he believes that by 2020 the technology will be widely available			0
if @entity1 does unveil a smartwatch in @entity114 it could do so before rival @entity8 and its rumoured @entity49			0
@entity8 is set to announce a new high - end iphone handset , as well as a cheaper model in september and it could use the same event to announce the watch			0
dates for this announcement have varied between the end of august and october .			0
