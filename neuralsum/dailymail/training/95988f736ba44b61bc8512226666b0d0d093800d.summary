a grieving mother is trying to raise awareness of male domestic abuse after her son was brutally murdered by the ' psychotic ' girlfriend he loved			1
@entity5 , 31 , from @entity6 in @entity7 , was jailed last year for stabbing @entity8 , 20 , to death			1
she stabbed him 24 times in the front and back with a kitchen knife in an attack that was so forceful , she snapped the blade			1
' i would describe her as a monster			2
i understand that there were n't what they call defence wounds on his hands			0
i do n't want to think about it , ' she said			0
@entity5 and @entity17 had been together for two years after meeting through friends and had a volatile relationship			1
@entity16 said she knew the pair often argued but she never believed petite blonde @entity5 would be capable of murder			1
but the mother - of - two had suffered a troubled childhood , was a heavy drug user and had mental health issues			2
@entity17 , who was a college student taking a course in hotel management , knew of her troubled past and was determined to help her			1
@entity16 adds that he was also flattered that a more experienced , older woman was interested in dating him			0
showed no remorse : @entity5 pleaded not guilty to murder after stabbing @entity17 24 times and then waiting 20 minutes to call the emergency services ' he was definitely smitten			1
you could see the twinkle in his eyes that he was excited , ' said @entity16 of her son when he first started his relationship with @entity54			2
however , his friends did not take to his new girlfriend			0
' my first impression was she was just strange , ' says @entity60 , a close friend of @entity17 's			1
' she 'd say inappropriate things			0
' he added : ' she was such a handful , and i used to feel so sorry for @entity17			1
' as @entity17 and @entity5 ' relationship progressed , she began to become more possessive and tried to stop him seeing his friends			1
@entity16 recalls : ' it was okay for her to go out with her friends and have a laugh , have a drink , do whatever girlies do			0
but it was like a rule for one but not for the other			0
' then @entity5 ' behaviour started to become violent			1
@entity16 said : ' there were times when @entity17 would stay over and she would kick him out in the early hours of the morning			1
he would come home with his face scratched or a black eye			0
' i said , " what happened ? " he said that they got into a row and she just went berserk			0
' @entity17 's friends and family tried to persuade him to end his relationship with @entity54			1
' i often did say to him , " are you sure you want to be in this relationship ? and do you not think it 's wise to take a break ? " ' @entity16 said			2
' but he 'd say , " no i want to help her , i want to support her			0
she has n’t had it easy and she is facing up to her demons "			0
he wanted to be the rock in her life			0
' @entity60 added : ' he genuinely thought that he could help her work through her issues			0
' @entity17 and @entity5 moved into a rented cottage together in the village of @entity103 , @entity7 , in the summer of 2012			1
their neighbour , @entity104 , said she often heard them having blazing rows			0
' you do n't expect someone 4ft 11 , slim , attractive blonde , living next door to you , to turn out to be a killer ' she said : ' they would argue on a regular basis , sometimes it was once a week , sometimes every ten days			0
it never went as long as two weeks without an argument			0
' but like @entity17 's friends and family , she never believed the arguments would escalate to murder			1
she said : ' what does a murderer look like ? you do n't expect someone 4ft 11 , slim , attractive blonde , living next door to you , to turn out to be a killer			0
' police were called to @entity5 ' home in the early hours of the 6th november 2012 where they found @entity17 bleeding to death			1
after one of their usual rows , @entity5 had armed herself with a kitchen knife and stabbed @entity17 24 times as he sat on the sofa			1
shocked : @entity16 never thought @entity5 would be capable of murder paramedics battled to save his life but he died in hospital			1
@entity5 was arrested and charged with murder but pleaded not guilty claiming she had acted in self defence			1
but her neighbour @entity146 did n't buy her story for a second			0
' i think if you stab someone 24 times you damn well mean them to be dead , ' she said			1
and chillingly , it transpired that @entity5 had waited 20 minutes before calling the emergency services , precious time that could have saved @entity17 's life			1
dr @entity157 explains in the documentary : ' i believe she planned to kill him , and i believe that in those 20 minutes she knew he was dying , and she let him die			1
at the point that he was lying on the floor , she could have got help			0
@entity17 did n't die immediately			1
paramedics battled to save his life			0
if he 'd had 20 minutes of additional help there 's a chance he could have survived			1
' smitten : @entity17 had wanted to help @entity5 through her problems			1
the mother - of - two has been jailed for life @entity17 's friend @entity60 said it was this that shocked him the most			1
' that 's something that a serial killer does , someone who 's really quite twisted , psychotic , would do that , would watch their loved one die , ' he said			2
he added that even though @entity5 and @entity17 had a volatile relationship , he did n't believe @entity17 's death was a ' crime of passion '			1
he explains : ' had someone told me that it was a killing of passion , and i said to them you 're talking s * * * because killing of passion is when you feel passionate about something that moment , and once you realise what you 've done you sort of think that you snap out of it			0
' you 're like , " what have i done ? what have i done ? " and you will do anything in your power to rectify it , and you will show remorse , that 's a killing of passion			2
' you did n't mean to do it , and you let the whole world know that you did n't mean to do it			0
but she did n't do that			0
she sat there and she watched him die			0
' ' you were extremely angry with him and you were in a rage			0
he did not realistically stand a chance of defending himself such was the ferocity of the attack ' he added that @entity54 trying to make out @entity17 had attacked her first was a further insult			1
' the fact that she tried to tarnish his name is disgusting , it goes without saying that he would n’t do that			0
he 's not like that			2
he 's just not that kind of person , ' he said of @entity222 , who was known by many as a ' gentle giant			2
' a jury at @entity226 did n't believe @entity5 ' protests of innocence either when she appeared in court a year ago			1
judge @entity230 passed a life sentence on @entity5 , ordering her to serve a minimum of 15 years			1
he said : ' this was a brutal , ferocious and sustained attack			2
you loved each other but you were jealous of each other			0
' you were extremely angry with him and you were in a rage			0
he did not realistically stand a chance of defending himself such was the ferocity of the attack			2
' i detect no remorse in you			0
you have only been concerned with yourself			0
you did your very best to hoodwink the jury but they saw through you			0
' throughout this trial you have tried to portray yourself as a serial victim of domestic violence , that picture is not an accurate one			0
' @entity60 said @entity17 's friends and family are now struggling to come to terms with their loss			1
' she does n't realise what she 's taken away for everyone , ' he explains			2
' she does n’t realise the hole that she 's left in people 's lives , especially his mum			2
that 's someone you can never replace			2
he 's got a place in my heart and he always will have			2
' @entity16 added : ' i feel robbed and stripped			0
' but she does n't want her son 's death to be in vain so she is now working to raise the often overlooked issue of male domestic violence			2
@entity60 explains : ' she wants to turn something that 's negative into something that 's positive to help other people , and that 's just where @entity17 gets his good heart and kind nature from , his mum			1
' @entity286 's @entity285 : a @entity287 , will be aired on the @entity288 on sunday at 9pm			2
