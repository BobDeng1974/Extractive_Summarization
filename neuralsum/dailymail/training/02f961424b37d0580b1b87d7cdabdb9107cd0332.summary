rating : we 're in the @entity1 , of course , as the name , @entity3 , suggests with all the subtlety of a @entity7 leadership bid			2
except that we 're not			2
rather , this is @entity10 , near @entity11 in @entity12 , where an old boozer has been given the full country chic make - over , with eight bedrooms above the rustic dining room			1
country living : the @entity3 has been given the full chic make - over and rooms cost from £ 205 if this really were the @entity1 , a double would cost £ 120 tops , but here on the @entity26 estate i 'm paying £ 205 room only			1
i had tried to get the rate down , but was told in a deadpan sort of way that it was out of the question			2
there 's no bath , but the bed is huge and there are two proper sash windows facing the front and , hallelujah , they open wide			1
muted colours , some exposed beams , wood floors , @entity43 digital radio			0
on the ground floor , the wood - panelled restaurant spills out onto the pavement and there 's a long , slinky bar			1
three little framed county walks hang above a door and rural intent is never far away			0
more of the same , but a little more formal , is going on upstairs , with antlers on the wall and sepia photographs of men shooting , fishing and stalking			0
a round table of @entity60 girls notches up the decibel levels			0
they 'll be in the real @entity1 by friday evening , eating in somewhere identical with a similar menu , too			0
i start with half a dozen oysters from @entity66 and move on to some delicious line - caught cod with undercooked roast potatoes			1
it 's the overly loud music which drives me back upstairs to bed , but i can still hear it as i drift off			1
the @entity3 6 new @entity10 @entity12 @entity71 tel : 020 7724 7243 @entity72 doubles from £ 205 , room only rating : overall comfort would be helped if the duvet and pillows had proper feathers in them			1
the music is still going strong at breakfast			0
it must be more for the benefit of the trendy staff than the guests			0
breakfast is all a la carte and works out to be expensive			0
my granola with yoghurt arrives long after i 've downed two cups of coffee			0
a final word about the name : it derives from @entity96 's allergy to cow 's milk and this is where she used to graze her goats			1
so it 's the real deal , after all , but a pricey real deal all the same .			2

the old boozer has been given the full country chic make - over
