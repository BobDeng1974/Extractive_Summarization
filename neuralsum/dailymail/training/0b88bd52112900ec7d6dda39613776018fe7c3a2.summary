by @entity1 reporter an average car tyre will travel around 20,000 miles over its lifetime , but when they have reached the end of their life in @entity9 ... they are destined for the tyre graveyard			0
in @entity15 's @entity14 area every year gigantic holes are dug out out in the sandy earth and filled with old tyres - there are now over seven million in the ground			1

the tyre graveyard : an average car tyre will travel around 20,000 miles over its lifetime , but when they have reached the end of their life in @entity9 ... they are destined for the tyre graveyard a sea of rubber : in @entity15 's @entity14 area every year gigantic holes are dug out out in the sandy earth and filled with old tyres - there are now over seven million in the ground visible : an aerial image shows the vast amount of used tyres that are put in the ground - the patches are even visible from space it is thought the tyres are from both @entity9 and other countries which have paid for them to be taken away - four companies are in charge of the disposal and are thought to make a substantial amount from the disposal fees			1
the @entity52 landfill directive means that this type of ' waste disposal would be illegal in @entity52 - since 2006 @entity56 rules have banned the disposal of tyres in landfill sites , leaving about 480,000 tonnes of recyclable shredded rubber each year in @entity63 all car and truck tyres must be recovered , recycled and reused			1
currently , more than 80 per cent of the 55 million used tyres generated in @entity63 are processed via the @entity65			1
the scheme ensures full traceability and accountability of waste tyres throughout the disposal chain , from collection through to their final reuse in an environmentally friendly or acceptable method			1
materials from properly recycled tyres are used for a variety of uses including a children ’s playground , running tracks , artificial sports pitches , fuel for cement kilns , carpet underlay , equestrian arenas and flooring			2
@entity87 of tyres can be used in the construction of modern engineered landfill sites and flood defences			2
if waste tyres are in good condition , they can be re-moulded and put back on the road as ‘ re-treads ’			2
banned : the @entity52 landfill directive means that this type of ' waste disposal ' would be illegal in @entity52 illegal : since 2006 it has been illegal in @entity63 to send waste tyres to landfill and all car and truck tyres must be recovered , recycled and reused in 2010 , just over 30 per cent of waste tyres were turned into crumb , 18 per cent were used in energy recovery , nearly 20 per cent were re-used ( in the @entity63 or abroad ) , 16 per cent were specifically used in landfill engineering and 11 per cent were re-treaded , according to the @entity108			1
in some circumstances tyres are shipped out to countries such as @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 , but there are strict laws about their exportation			0
the @entity108 says ' while there is a legitimate export market for quality recyclable material , the illegal export of waste undermines law - abiding disposal and tyre recovery businesses here in the @entity63 and risks harming people and the environment in the country the waste is exported to			1
' last month it emerged that recycled car tyres could soon be used to surface roads across the country after a pioneering trial found they made roads quieter			1
one of the busiest roads in @entity139 was resurfaced last year with the asphalt , containing shredded rubber from old tyres			1
tests were performed on grip and skid resistance , with engineers reporting that the rubber road , on a stretch of dual carriageway between @entity150 and @entity151 , resulted in a quieter drive			0
experts claim the road requires less maintenance and still allows for drainage , while tyre recyclers claim the technique will also save money because the new material is thinner than standard roads			0
dramatic : last year a fire broke out in a @entity9 tyre dump which was so big that it could be seen from space tower of tyres : in some circumstances tyres are shipped out to countries such as @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 from @entity63 , but there are strict laws about their exportation danger : there would be serious consequences if this field of tyres caught alight - tyre fires are difficult to extinguish - they produce a lot of smoke , which often carries toxic chemicals from the breakdown of rubber compounds while burning rubber roads were first built in the 1960s in the @entity185 , where today there are 20,000 miles of road made of recycled tyres			1
rubber roads are also popular in @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193			0
the technique has been found to cut traffic noise by about 25 per cent			0
the asphalt is made by breaking down used tyres into rubber ‘ crumbs ’ which are added to bitumen and crushed stone , which are typically used to make asphalt			2
last year a fire broke out in a @entity9 tyre dump which was so big that it could be seen from space			2
the fire broke out on april 17 at a tire dump near @entity209			0
it is believed that around five million tires fuelled the fire which specialists struggled to control			0
hundreds of firefighters as well as soldiers and employees of the @entity217 took part in the efforts to extinguish the blaze			0
a number of @entity222 described the fire as an ' environmental catastrophe ' and vowed to demand a debate on the issue in a special parliamentary session some said they will demand an official probe			0
a month later another fire broke out at an @entity232 scrapyard and firefighters from six stations were drafted into help			0
@entity237 fires are difficult to extinguish - they produce a lot of smoke , which often carries toxic chemicals from the breakdown of rubber compounds while burning .			0
