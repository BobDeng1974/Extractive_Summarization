in the past eight editions of the @entity2 since 2007 there have been seven different winners but coached by only six talented men			0
the attraction of this week ’s return to elite @entity8 football is that all four of those six winning coaches who remain active — sir @entity10 and @entity11 having retired — are immediately on @entity2 duty			0
@entity13 and @entity14 — the two repeat winners with @entity16 ( 2009 and 2011 ) and @entity18 / @entity17 ( 2007 and 2014 ) — face tantalising ties against familiar rivals			1
@entity21 coach @entity13 faces tantalising tie against @entity23 their teams — @entity21 and @entity17 — deserve to be two of the firmest favourites to reach the @entity28 , but dealing equally firmly with @entity23 and @entity29 will be a task			1
perhaps @entity31 ( winner with @entity33 , 2010 ) faces the match of the week , a proper test of @entity37 ’s mettle in @entity38 against @entity39 meanwhile , @entity40 goes @entity42 v @entity42 as he tries to get @entity29 to obliterate the 6 - 1 home defeat suffered against @entity14 ’s @entity44 to the @entity46 club winning this trophy a year ago			1
the @entity49 battle is fascinating			0
they both played for a @entity52 team — @entity53 and @entity54			0
they both lifted @entity57 silverware as midfielders			0
both gave dignity and sweat to the @entity42 national team ( just over 50 caps between them )			0
@entity31 's @entity37 face a proper test of their mettle in @entity38 against @entity39 @entity67 played for @entity37 , both men coached that club and won trophies for the @entity70 ’ empire			1
but there ’s a separation , too			0
@entity14 was born in the footballing heart of northern @entity42			1
@entity67 was born and raised in @entity75			0
some notional ‘ background gps ’ is n’t detectably the reason for this , but @entity14 is markedly thought of as the greater player			1
was he a better footballer than @entity40 ? that ’s arguable			2
but the elder man had the good fortune to play in exceptional teams — principally @entity85 ’s @entity18			0
@entity14 was the axis around which a great deal of creativity and improvisation throbbed			1
something which makes the lack of such a player in his current @entity17 squad , since @entity95 was sold , all the more irrational			2
where @entity40 had great fortune was in inheriting a good group of players at @entity37 , a group which had started to lose patience under @entity101 , but which had lost neither their talent or competitive edge			1
@entity14 and @entity40 , who took the @entity29 reins in october , have only competed head - to - head once before — on the opening day of the @entity108 season in 2010			1
the 6 - 0 hiding which @entity14 ’s @entity37 gave @entity110 hinted at a series of setback results , around the turn of the year , which saw @entity40 out of his job by february 2011			1
a mere 15 months later , @entity40 was dancing up the centre - stand steps at the @entity116 in @entity117 , shouting to @entity118 : ‘ i won it ! ’ and lifting the @entity2 trophy			2
@entity14 will have to lift his @entity17 players for @entity2 encounter the win had been fuelled by six of the same players — @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 — who had made his opening @entity108 day with @entity110 miserable			1
@entity67 ’s four - leaf clover when he took over at @entity37 was that @entity130 , @entity133 , @entity128 and @entity125 were n’t finished with the @entity2			2
however well he coached , they were footballers cut from the @entity135			0
and they had n’t stopped rocking			0
if he has a similarly - leaved lucky flora right now , it ’s that this is exactly the right moment to face @entity17			1
@entity14 admitted this weekend : ‘ since we won the world title in december , we have dropped our intensity and concentration			2
’ they keep dropping important players , too			0
@entity146 might make it back for this match in @entity149 but that would constitute his first game in more than a month			0
@entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 will all be missing — but it is the missing form of @entity156 and @entity157 which is less finite and less easy to define or cure			0
@entity29 may have been whipped 6 - 1 when @entity17 last came to town			1
but this is n’t nearly the same demolishing machine			0
real have looked mentally fatigued , less focused and without the claws which they used to savage both @entity29 and @entity21 in @entity163 last season — scoring 10 and conceding just once			1
@entity29 boss @entity40 goes @entity42 vs @entity42 in showdown with @entity14 ’s @entity17 @entity67 ’s team is n’t identical to a year ago			1
but their recent 1 - 1 draw with @entity13 ’s @entity21 — a notable enough result given that it is the second time they have drawn wi th the reigning @entity163 champions this season — featured @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , and @entity178 from the side that shipped six to @entity17			1
the @entity42 has made @entity29 much more ordered , harder to beat and , until @entity180 got himself banned for four games for a horrible foul on @entity183 , sharp up front			2
he has promoted from within , giving debuts to young goalkeeper @entity186 in that draw with @entity21 and @entity188 , a highly promising 19 - year - old central defender			2
what di @entity40 needs to use as his winning card , as far as the @entity29 squad is concerned , is that @entity17 ’s form in @entity163 last season was the exception , not the rule			1
@entity17 are on a nine - match winning streak in the @entity2 , scoring 25 goals and conceding three			2
but prior to those two big wins in @entity163 last season , they had won just one of 25 away matches against @entity202 sides — meaning their current domestic form is n’t quite how they would like to ‘ present ’			0
according to @entity17 ’s b - team coach , @entity205 , it ’s a threatening tie			2
‘ i would like to say that @entity29 has no chance and @entity17 will safely reach the quarter - finals , ’ he told @entity207			1
‘ but in the knockout phase , anything can happen			0
in two games , you have double the chance of an outsider playing above themselves			0
so a team like ours must always be cautious , especially against @entity163			0
but he forgot to warn @entity221 to check if @entity40 is sporting a four - leaf clover in his lapel .			2

@entity13 's @entity21 must deal with @entity23
@entity37 face a proper test of their mettle against @entity39
@entity40 's @entity29 take on @entity17 and @entity14
