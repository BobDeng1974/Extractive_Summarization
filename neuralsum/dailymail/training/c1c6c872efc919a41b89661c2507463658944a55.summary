' big row ' ? @entity1 admitted having an argument with her husband @entity3 in an interview with gossip magazine @entity6 published online last night the husband of @entity1 yesterday vehemently rejected claims he might be responsible for apparent marks on her face and body			1
the former @entity13 provoked fevered speculation after she returned to @entity16 on sunday with what appeared to be scratches and a bruised cheek			1
the judge came back for the final after being admitted to hospital on thursday but there was no explanation for her absence			0
viewers took to @entity27 to make comments about the mysterious marks , linking them to her husband @entity3 , who has previously been accused of being violent and possessive towards a girlfriend			1
but yesterday he described the remarks as ‘ disgusting ’			0
he said , using typical celeb @entity27 speak : ‘ i do n’t usually respond to @entity27 msgs but i will respond to comments of hitting wife which i think are quite disgusting untrue			0
‘ @entity1 was very ill a bunch of doctors help her get better if fans ca n’t just relax @entity41 being negative they r not real fans of @entity1 ’ it was just a month ago that @entity3 presented his wife with a wedding ring ‘ upgrade ’ – a seven - carat diamond the size of a ten - pence piece			1
he handed her the ring just as she was about to go on air for @entity16 – a dramatic , romantic gesture			1
on sunday night , however , the giant bauble was visibly absent from @entity1 ’s wedding finger			1
according to a well - placed source on @entity16 , @entity56 , 39 , did not visit his wife of seven years during the three days she spent in hospital			1
nor , says the source , was @entity3 with her at @entity16 studios for the final on sunday			1
the fact that @entity1 has removed her wedding ring ‘ upgrade ’ is surely an indicator that the seven - year marriage is in serious trouble			1
could it be all over between them ? it is telling that when the @entity71 contacted @entity1 ’s agent and publicist yesterday and asked whether the marriage was over , neither would confirm or deny the suggestion			1
the source revealed that @entity56 is not liked by other members of @entity16 team			1
‘ none of that means that he has ever laid a finger on @entity1 , but he is not an easy person to be with , that is obvious to see			1
it was a physical and emotional collapse			0
there was an emotional element to it , @entity1 has been under a lot of stress			2
‘ he did n’t come to the show on sunday as far as i am aware			0
he was n't in her dressing room			0
i do n’t believe he visited her in hospital , either			0
’ @entity1 was three hours late for an interview with @entity6 , published online last night , in which she was described as ' not in the best of moods ' and reportedly admitted an argument with @entity3			1
' i walked in pissed off because i had a big row with my husband about stupid stuff , ' @entity6 's @entity101 quoted the former @entity13 as saying			0
' sometimes he p * * * * * me off like no other , but he gets me			0
' ' disgusting ' : @entity3 took to @entity27 to slam speculation he was linked to marks seen on the star bruised ? fans took to @entity27 during x factor on sunday to claim that @entity1 's face look bruised swollen ? some viewers said that @entity1 's left cheek looked bruised during the @entity16 final on sunday night , while others remarked on apparent marks seen on her shoulders and the inside of her elbow ( circled above ) on sunday , @entity3 was seen outside the @entity123 block of flats where he and @entity1 , 39 , have been renting an apartment since october , overseeing the loading of about 20 suitcases into a minivan			1
so what do we know of the events of the past few days ? according to the @entity16 source , @entity1 was on her way to @entity134 on thursday afternoon for a press conference with the judges and finalists when she was taken ill. ‘ the driver , who has known @entity1 for a while and is a good guy , took her to @entity141 – he was that concerned – and she was admitted			1
‘ she was discharged on sunday after asking the doctors if she could go at lunchtime			0
’ the source says that reports that @entity1 was in a high dependency unit may not be accurate			2
‘ that ’s not to say that she was n’t unwell , because she was			0
’ the source says @entity1 underwent tests , but would not say what these tests revealed			2
no wedding ring : @entity1 appeared on @entity16 on sunday without her wedding ring			1
it 's just a month since @entity3 presented her with a wedding ring ‘ upgrade ’ – a seven - carat diamond the size of a ten - pence piece speculation about the marriage has been so intense partly on account of @entity56 ’s history			1
in 2007 , shortly after their marriage in june that year , it emerged that @entity3 had been charged with battery in @entity170 after being arrested for attacking his then girlfriend , @entity171			2
he pleaded ‘ no contest ’ to the battery charge – which the judge stated was the same as a guilty plea – and was ordered to take part in a ‘ @entity177 ’			0
in 2008 , around the time @entity1 and @entity3 had a wedding blessing in @entity180 , a friend of miss @entity171 told a newspaper about his violent and possessive character			1
@entity171 is said to have told her friend : ‘ i fear for @entity185 because a leopard does not change his spots			0
‘ he seems utterly charming – but i ’m afraid it wo n’t be long before his mask slips			0
’ @entity171 told her friend that @entity3 was over-possessive			2
‘ i would be away on photo shoots and @entity3 would call my hotel room hundreds of times a night demanding : “ who the * * * * are you with , @entity195 ? ” ‘ one time we went out partying in @entity198 and @entity3 was convinced a man in the bar was eyeing me up , which was total rubbish			2
@entity3 followed him out of the bar and beat him senseless			2
’ miss @entity171 ’s friend told the newspaper the relationship became on and off and finally ended after @entity3 told @entity171 he ’d met someone else			2
@entity171 told the friend : ‘ one night he turned to me and said , “ @entity195 , i ’ve met someone who is very famous and very rich and wants to marry me but if you will have me back then i ’ll forget it ”			0
he would n’t say who she was but said , “ she is so rich she could change my life ”			0
’ of course , these could be the observations of a woman scorned			0
but @entity1 is certainly rich – she is worth an estimated £ 35million			2
since the marriage , @entity1 has been estranged from her family			2
when her family learned she had been admitted to hospital , her mother , @entity220 , was forced to post a series of messages on @entity27 pleading for information about her daughter			0
at her home in @entity227 yesterday , mrs @entity220 said she did not know any more about what had happened to her daughter than anyone else			0
cursed ? couples who speak to @entity231 ! about their idyllic relationships sometimes split shortly afterwards only last week , @entity1 was @entity231 ! magazine ’s cover story			2
it is customary for interviewees in @entity231 ! to present a perfect family life and @entity1 was no exception			2
but has the famous curse of @entity231 ! – by which couples who speak about their idyllic relationship split up shortly afterwards – struck again ? in one photograph , @entity1 is seated on a sofa with her husband and three daughters – @entity250 , 15 , from her first marriage to dancer @entity252 , seven - year - old @entity253 , from her relationship with actor @entity255 , and @entity256 , she and @entity3 ’s three - year - old daughter			1
@entity1 gushed about how happy she was with @entity3			1
‘ he ’s the first man i ’ve ever trusted , he ’s my rock and he ’s the beginning and the end of who i am			0
’ in @entity170 , where she now lives , @entity1 appears as a judge on @entity264 and has starred in her own reality show , @entity1 : it ’s a @entity267			1
@entity1 was unsure whether the girl best known here as @entity1 would go down well on @entity16 , but the risk paid off and has revived her name in the @entity271			1
but the @entity16 final of 2014 , won by @entity273 , will now be remembered for all the mystery surrounding @entity1 ’s hospital dash			1
back in 2010 , there were reports that the couple had split in the run - up to it ’s a @entity267 , but it was later claimed that the ‘ split ’ was a publicity stunt			0
some may believe this latest episode , too , is a publicity stunt , a way of getting even with fellow judge and @entity16 supremo , @entity288 , who had been critical of her act , @entity290			0
if it is a stunt , it ’s a highly convincing act			0
backstage on @entity16 , it did not go unnoticed that @entity1 ’s demeanour changed whenever her husband was about			1
maybe that influence is slipping now and @entity1 has decided to break away .			0

@entity16 viewers were *shocked* to see @entity1 apparently bruised during final
@entity3 vehemently rejects claims he might be responsible for the marks
the @entity71 *outlines* the events surrounding @entity1 's appearance on the show
