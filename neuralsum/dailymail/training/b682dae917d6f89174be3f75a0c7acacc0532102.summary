walking your dog , enjoying wine with a picnic and even meeting friends in the street have been turned into offences in a sweeping expansion of police and @entity11 powers , a report warned last night			2
a study by the @entity13 revealed widespread use of a string of little - noticed laws introduced by the last @entity18 government			1
the group warned that ‘ ordinary freedoms and legal protections have been suspended in large areas of public space ’			1
wrong ? enjoying wine with a picnic or meeting friends in the street have been turned into offences in a sweeping expansion of police and @entity11 powers most of the laws were passed under the banner of @entity18 ’s ‘ respect ’ agenda which aimed to crack down on anti-social behaviour			1
for example , rules banning drinking in public places were supposed to target teenage drinking in parks			2
but the powers are so widely drawn that they can be trained on families enjoying a picnic			2
the @entity13 said there is particular concern that many of the zones - which are decided by the authorities drawing lines on a map - are not clearly marked			1
this means members of the public can commit an offence without knowing they have done anything wrong			2
several pensioners have been caught out by ‘ no - dog ’ zones they did not know about			1
the penalties can be harsh			2
‘ drinking in a designated public place ' is a criminal offence , and usually punished by an on - the - spot fine			1
the maximum penalty is £ 500 in some areas			2
it would be logged on the @entity68			2
dog walking in an area where it is banned , such as straying into a play area in a public park , is a civil matter			0
but in all cases the person would end up in court if they did n't pay the fine – which means a potential criminal record			0
walking the dog : the @entity13 warned that ' ordinary freedoms and legal protections have been suspended in large areas of public space ' @entity84 , director of the @entity13 , said : ‘ ordinary freedoms and legal protections have been suspended in large areas of public space			1
' an everyday activity can be an offence if you do it on the wrong street			0
when officials have such open - ended powers , they can make up the law as they see fit ' @entity84 , @entity13 ‘ an everyday activity can be an offence if you do it on the wrong street			1
when officials have such open - ended powers , they can make up the law as they see fit			1
‘ at the very least , these zones should all be marked : it is fundamentally unjust that people could be punished for offences they did not know they were committing			0
in the long run , we need a serious debate about whether we want these controls spreading across our public spaces			0
’ local authorities across the @entity112 have enacted the zones			0
in @entity115 alone , the authorities have declared 435 special ‘ zones ’ which ban the public from taking part in what are normally considered law - abiding activities			1
combined , the exclusion zones cover half of the capital			0
not welcome : schoolchildren picured out in the dispersal zone in south - west @entity115			1
there were 32 dispersal zones in @entity115 found by the club the @entity13 used freedom of information laws to discover there are : 110 leafleting zones , within which people must buy a council licence if they want to leaflet			1
there were 37 fines for the offence of ' unlicensed leafleting ' in 2011 - 12			1
32 dispersal zones , within which groups of two or more people can be asked to leave the area and not return for 24 hours			0
there have been 547 recent orders to disperse			0
219 dog exclusion zones , within which people can not walk their dogs			0
there were 56 fines for the offence of walking dogs in a no - dog zone in 2011 - 12			2
74 alcohol confiscation zones , within which people can have their alcohol confiscated			0
the @entity159 issued 663 fines for the offence of drinking in public in 2010 , and there are several thousand alcohol confiscations each year			0
the @entity13 has delivered a string of warnings about how the public is being subjected to increasingly draconian powers			1
earlier this year , the group warned how armies of civilian ‘ busybodies ’ with as little as five days ’ training have been handed sweeping police powers which allow them to destroy people ’s careers			0
@entity177 responses reveal there are now 2,617 snoopers licensed under @entity18 ’s hugely controversial @entity180 – a rise of 1,000 in only three years			1
they include park wardens , shopping centre staff , park attendants and housing association staff accredited to hand out fines for ' crimes ' such as littering , dog fouling and criminal damage			0
the civilians do not answer to a police constable – and four out of five forces do not bother to keep track on what they are doing once they have been given their powers			0
the @entity13 has published an online map of the banned zones in @entity115			1
it is available by clicking here .			0
