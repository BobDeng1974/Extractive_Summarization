no red card , no clean sheet , no points			0
@entity4 ’s second match in charge of @entity6 could not have been much more different to the first			1
instead , having opened with a touchline dismissal and a win at @entity11 , this was something of a wake - up call			0
@entity14 , @entity15 and then @entity13 capitalised on shaky defending to put @entity16 in control			1
@entity18 pulled one back in the 53rd minute with a sweet drive from 20 yards , but ultimately @entity6 lacked the quality and ruthlessness for back - to - back wins			1
@entity13 ( hidden ) celebrates scoring @entity16 's second goal with his team - mates @entity25 vies for the ball with @entity6 's @entity27 in midfield as @entity16 came out on top @entity16 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity29 5.5 ; @entity30 6 , @entity31 6 , @entity32 6 , @entity33 6.5 ; @entity34 6.5 , buyens 6.5 , @entity13 6.5 , @entity25 5 ; @entity35 6 ; @entity15 7			1
subs not used : @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43			0
goals : @entity15 28 , @entity13 51			1
booked : @entity45 , @entity46			0
@entity6 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity47 6 ; @entity48 6 , @entity49 6 , @entity50 6 , @entity51 6.5 ; @entity52 5.5 , @entity53 6.5 ; @entity55 6 ( @entity56 62 , 6 ) , @entity54 6.5 , @entity57 6 ; @entity58 5			1
subs not used : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65			0
booked : @entity67 referee : @entity69 @entity70 : @entity15 that was never more evident than late in the first half			2
@entity57 had opened @entity16 ’s defence with a backheel which left back @entity18 received on the overlap			1
his low cross was perfect but @entity58 took a big swing and missed the ball altogether			0
it was a pitiful end to @entity6 ’s one move of genuine class in the first half			2
by then they were already 1 - 0 down			0
@entity46 made the chance with a delightful ball over the top which @entity15 took down and finished in a smooth , sweet motion			2
@entity15 was then involved in the second , squaring for @entity13 to finish in the 51st minute before @entity18 drilled home a low shot across @entity29 from 20 yards two minutes later			1
it was a good strike but not enough to turn the tide			0
for @entity16 , the win keeps them in the chasing pack			1
but it ’s fair to say @entity98 ’ side did not start this fixture like a unit that only tasted defeat for the first time at the weekend			0
inside two minutes @entity29 spilled a weak shot from @entity104 and had to scramble to gather the loose ball			0
within four @entity4 was waving his players forward , such was @entity16 ’s frailty in possession			1
@entity4 will have been disappointed in what he saw from his side in his second game in charge of @entity6 it was 27 minutes until they had a meaningful opening – @entity13 scuffing when well placed – and a minute later before they managed a proper shot , from which @entity15 scored for his second of the season			1
@entity6 , for all their hard work , did n’t have much quality to offer in the first half			1
@entity58 ’s miss was the low point , even if the move highlighted that they do have guile in the side			0
@entity13 made it 2 - 0 but @entity18 gave @entity6 a fighting chance with his impressive finish moments later and @entity58 had a header cleared off the line			1
@entity4 said : ‘ i think we should have got something but should does n’t cut it in football			2
we do n’t score enough and we concede too many but the standard of performance was very high			0
‘ we are losing games and i need to change that very quickly			0
’ @entity16 manager @entity98 said : ‘ everyone said we were favourites to get relegated and now we have 22 points			2
’ @entity98 also insisted he had no interest in the managerial vacancy at @entity146 , who share a chairman - @entity148 – with @entity16			2
@entity98 said : ‘ i had a meal with him ( @entity151 ) on monday and i am very happy at @entity16			2
i am not leaving here			0
i made a commitment to @entity16			0
’ @entity18 smashes home the consolation for the travelling side but in truth @entity6 were poor			1

@entity15 and @entity13 scored a narrow win for @entity16
@entity6 lacked quality aside from @entity18 's strike to pull one goal back
@entity4 must now rally his troops to improve performances
