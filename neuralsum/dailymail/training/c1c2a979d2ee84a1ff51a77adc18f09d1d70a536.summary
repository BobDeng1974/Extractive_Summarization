by @entity0 published : 06:04 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 09:59 est , 7 may 2013 this is the amazing collection of the world 's most wonderful hot air balloons - and it includes everything from @entity7 bottles to space shuttles and polar bears			1
they are all produced by @entity11 , in @entity12 , who make between 150 and 200 every year as the world 's leading hot air balloon company			1
the company is owned by @entity18 aeronautical engineer @entity17 , 73 , who designed and flew western @entity20 's first modern hot air balloon in 1967 with a group of friends at the @entity23			1
one small step for man , to create one giant hot air balloon : a replica of a @entity29 space shuttle which was created by @entity11 in @entity12 they carried out their first test flight at the @entity32 on the @entity33 in @entity34 , and mr @entity17 was hooked			1
within four years he had quit his job as an engineer and started designing balloons full time			1
now his company employ 67 people and they produce an incredible selection of balloons which they sell around the world			1
his daughter @entity44 is one of the company 's directors			2
the company was even responsible for the @entity48 - the first balloon to fly around the world non-stop in 1999			2
custom design : a hot air balloon designed to look like a polar bear which was created by @entity11			1
a balloon like this is made out of around 3,000 square metres of fabric wacky creation : a @entity58 , left			1
with the basket it stands at 51 metres tall and the fabric used would make up to 1,340 suits			1
right is a custom - designed @entity18 - piper balloon over the years they have created balloons designed to look like shopping trolleys , newspapers , @entity68 , @entity69 , a @entity70 and the @entity71 for clients			2
a recent @entity74 's ice cream cone that they created measures 28.5metres tall when fully - inflated and 21.4metres across at its widest point			2
in total , it required 3,809 square metres of fabric			1
if the area inside was to be filled with ice cream , it would take 2.3million kilograms of the tasty treat to fill it up			0
the creations take around 12 weeks complete from the day the order is placed to when it is ready to fly			0
bigfoot : this balloon is designed to look like a shoe , and has each of the laces fitted			2
the tiny weaved basket can be seen underneath childrens ' favourite : a @entity98 balloon designed by @entity11 takes off at daybreak near @entity100 in central @entity101 terrifying : a @entity68 balloon gets ready for take off , let , while this is the face of a @entity103 made for a @entity105 beer company ( right ) the company 's cheapest balloons are designed to hold three or four people and cost £ 20,000 but the high - end custom models are priced at in excess of £ 50,000			1
@entity44 , director , said that a team of 16 people work on each of the projects			0
' the first thing we do is hold a face - to - face meeting with the person who is buying the balloon to find out exactly what they want and exactly what colours they want us to use , ' she said			2
' at this point we make a @entity125 visual with @entity128 characteristics so they can see what it will look like from every angle once made			2
we can also produce a 3d scale model which is small enough to sit on a desk so it gives a clear idea of what it will look like			2
fairytale : @entity139 shows off a @entity141 castle balloon designed by the @entity12 - based firm ' the next stage is production			2
the bulk of the balloon is made from ripstop nylon which is a very lightweight material			2
some specialist fabrics are used at the mouth and at the top of the balloon			0
' during the production process we use everything from a pair of scissors through to specialist cutting equipment			0
it takes 16 of our staff about 12 weeks to produce a balloon			0
' a basic model will use about 1,000 square metres of fabric and three kilometres of thread - although more specialist models use three times as much			1
@entity11 , based in @entity166 , @entity12 , are the world 's largest balloon manufacturer			1
up for the cup : a 38 metre tall model of the @entity71 which is made out of 3,664 metres of fabric and would cover over half the @entity173 pitch if it was flattened ( left ) and ( right ) a newspaper is turned into a hot air balloon terrifying ! a @entity177 style hot air balloon which is so intricately designed that each of its teeth are filled with air and inflated as well ( left ) and children 's favourite @entity184 ( right ) for founder mr @entity17 , it all began in july 1967 when his first balloon - the red and white striped @entity187 - took off from @entity32 on the @entity188			1
his daughter @entity189 said : ' my father enjoyed gliding and he had heard of a balloon being used in the military in the @entity195 and he wrote off to them			0
a man who had flown it wrote back to him about it			0
' he thought it would be fun to make one of them and learn to fly it over here			0
so applying what he had been told and some good science he created one for himself			0
' at the time there were no hot air balloons in @entity20 so the story caused a sensation			1
' remarkable : a balloon designed to look like a @entity211 which was created by the @entity12 - based company for the @entity214 @entity213			2
around 85 per cent of the balloons made by the @entity217 company are exported two very different birds : the company produce between 150 and 200 balloons a year - including this @entity221 , left , and an @entity223 balloon , right weird creations : they have made all types of balloons - from world - record - breaking balloons - to weird and wacky shapes , film characters , space shuttles and even an upside - down balloon udderly incredible : a winged cow floats through the sky ( right )			1
this is one of the @entity12 - based company 's most wacky creations balloons over @entity12 : the @entity239 above @entity12 is a sea of colour during the annual ballooning festival held every august the balloon was made out of ripstock nylon - just as modern ones are today - and is still kept in the @entity11 headquarters			1
ms @entity44 said : ' ballooning is one of these amazing things			0
even a straightforward balloon - people will stop and wave , and take photographs			0
' it 's the best way to fly			0
the views from a balloon are incredible - you can see for miles and miles			0
' i 've been flying since i was three - years - old and it 's much more interesting than flying in a plane			0
there 's a bit of chance to it as well - you 're never quite sure where you 're going to end up			0
measured approach : the material is selected for the latest hot air balloon to roll off the @entity12 production line			1
the bulk of each balloon is made out of lightweight ripstock nylon stitch - up : a woman uses a sewing machine to stitch together the panels of fabric which will make up a balloon			1
even a small one uses three kilometres of stitching she said that the company has produced some amazing models over the years			1
' one of my favourite ones is the @entity177			0
when it 's inflating or landing you can be chomped by its teeth			0
we 've done all sorts , from a full @entity18 pipe major , a lightbulb , @entity141 castles and ufos			0
' the hard ones to design are the very tall and slim ones or the slim horizontal ones			0
you need to bulk them out to get more volume , without compromising the design			0
' a @entity7 bottle is technically hard to do - as it 's tall and thin , you have to make the balloon so big to counteract that , while still being true to the customer 's wishes			1
' production process : one of the member 's of staff works on a new wicker basket for one of the smaller balloons which holds around three people ( left ) while a woman works on the sewing machine ( right ) production : two workers in the factory in @entity166 , @entity12 , at work on their sewing machines family firm : @entity44 , director at @entity11 , with the fabric the company use			1
her father @entity326 , a @entity18 aeronautical engineer , created the company			0
