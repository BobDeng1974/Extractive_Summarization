by @entity0 last updated at 7:55 pm on 1st december 2011 @entity2 motorists will be going green in more ways than one in the coming years when the country 's longest autobahn is turned into a giant public park			0
part of the @entity9 will be covered with a 10ft - thick canopy in an attempt to reconnect districts in @entity13 which have been divided for nearly 30 years since the road was built			1
the three - mile strip will stretch from the city 's @entity17 district to @entity19 and will be 100ft wide in some places			2
the motorway will run underneath in the hope of reducing noise pollution and re-connecting communities in the city it is also hoped the $ 1billion project will tackle what has been a huge source of noise pollution in an area that sees more than 150,000 cars pass through each day			1
that number is expected to exceed 160,000 by 2025			0
but the move is not without its critics , who fear the construction will cause major disruptions to traffic			0
the motorway , which spans more than 500miles and provides a straight passage between @entity52 and @entity53 , is not just important to @entity2 , but also much of @entity54 , it was reported on @entity55			0
gardening plots in @entity19 's south - east side will also be forced to relocate as a result of the development			2
blueprint : this cross-section shows how the park will stretch both lengthways ( top ) and widthways ( bottom ) over the lanes of traffic			0
each section should take about four years to finish park life : the development at @entity71 will include a half - mile green space with a wooded area and community gardens the project will involve building up the sides of the motorway so the canopy can be built over the lanes of traffic			1
work will start next year with the @entity71 district , where the half - mile park will include both a wooded parkland and community gardens			2
the quarter - mile stretch in @entity86 will boast a tree - lined promenade to offset the noise caused by the six lanes of traffic underneath			0
quiet zone : the quarter - mile stretch in @entity86 will have a tree - lined promenade to factor out some of the noise caused by the six lanes of traffic underneath @entity19 hosts the longest canopy and will even see the construction of 1,700 new residential apartments			1
each section should take about four years to complete			0
the @entity9 cover is n't the first of its kind , but it will be the largest in @entity2			1
the upgrades are part of the @entity13 , @entity54 @entity107 2011 program			2
the project , mostly financed by the federal government , will cost around $ 1billion .			1

$ 1billion project will see 10ft - thick canopy stretched over the @entity9 at @entity13
