furious activists fighting against @entity1 have demanded that a @entity3 hamlet changes its name from ' death to @entity6 '			1
anger against the small settlement of @entity10 - aux - @entity9 - which has a population of less than 20 and is around 60 miles south of @entity13 - comes amid increasing claims of @entity1 prejudice in @entity3			1
the @entity16 , an internationally renowned @entity9 pressure group , has now sent a letter to @entity3 's interior minister to complain about the hamlet 's name , and express shock that nothing has previously been done to address its controversial moniker			2
controversial : anger against the small settlement of @entity24 - aux - @entity9 ( pictured ) - which has a population of less than 20 and is 60 miles south of @entity13 - comes amid increasing claims of @entity1 prejudice in @entity3 @entity26 , director of the @entity16 , said he was ' shocked to discover the existence of a village in @entity3 officially called ' death to @entity6 '			1
referring to the @entity30 and the @entity3 collaborator government , mr @entity26 added : ' it is extremely shocking that this name has slipped under the radar in the 70 years that have passed since @entity3 was liberated from @entity36 and the @entity38 regime			0
' local police and the national railway , the @entity41 , assisted the @entity42 during the @entity43 , which saw about 76,000 @entity3 jews murdered			0
many more were persecuted in major cities , including @entity13 , where ' round - ups ' were regularly carried out by the @entity42			0
but the deputy mayor of the village of @entity49 - which has jurisdiction over ' @entity51 ' , said nobody had anything to be ashamed of			1
this name has always existed , ' said @entity57 - @entity56 , in an interview with @entity3 's national news agency , @entity59			1
' no one has anything against the @entity6 , of course			0
it does n't surprise me that this is coming up again			0
' history : local police and the national railway , the @entity41 , assisted the @entity42 during the @entity43 , which saw about 76,000 @entity3 @entity6 ( pictured ) murdered changing the name would require a decision by the municipal council , and ms @entity56 said this was unlikely to be successful			1
' why change a name that goes back to the @entity73 or even further ? , ' she said			0
' we should respect these old names			0
' a previous municipal council , at least 20 years ago , already refused to change the name of this hamlet , which consists of a farm and two houses			1
' the @entity82 offensive against @entity83 , in which hundreds of civilians including young children have died , has led to claims of increased anti-semitism in @entity3			0
others say that the increasing electoral success of the far - right @entity90 , whose founder @entity91 is a convicted anti-semite , is another reason why @entity6 are feeling unsafe			2
there are currently around 500,000 @entity6 in @entity3 , but many are expressing a desire to emigrate to places where they will feel more secure			2
@entity97 - which means ' @entity6 ' - is a @entity99 village which voted to change its name in may .			2

small settlement has been named @entity51 since the @entity73
has population of less than 20 and consists of just a farm and two houses
name is causing anger amid increasing claims of @entity1 in @entity3
activists demand village 's name is changed , but local deputy mayor refused
@entity57 - @entity56 described the anger as ' ridiculous ' , adding : ' no one has anything against the @entity6 , of course '
