it is easy to be dazzled by a @entity2 player shining in the brilliant white of @entity4			1
the image could hardly be more romantic for fans dreaming of the national side rising once again			0
in that respect , those who saw footage of the @entity10 on tuesday afternoon would be hoping they caught a glimpse of the future			2
@entity15 produced a fine headed goal as part of a starring role within @entity4 ’s 2 - 0 win over @entity20 in the baby of @entity23 ’s elite competition			1
remember the name of @entity15 , the 18 - year - old scot starring for @entity4 's youth team harper in action for the @entity27 during a @entity10 match against @entity20 on tuesday @entity15 starred for @entity4 's young guns as he scored a goal , rattled the woodwork and forced a numer of saves it was a performance which showed why the 18 - year - old is rated as one of the brightest youth talents at perhaps the world ’s most famous club			1
he was born in @entity41 shortly after dad @entity42 and mum @entity43 — originally from @entity44 — moved out to @entity45			0
the young @entity15 ’s promise was quickly evident , with @entity4 making a move to snatch him from under the noses of @entity49 when he was 13			1
he currently has three years left on a five - year contract with the @entity52 holders			1
despite growing up in far warmer climes , the teenager remains a passionate about the old country and is already integrated within the @entity57 ’s youth structure			2
performance director @entity58 has been out to the @entity45 capital to visit the @entity4 academy and is in little doubt of the talent @entity15 possesses			1
yet the @entity63 also urges caution about burdening him with excessive expectation			0
while the sight of a scot representing @entity68 is seductive , @entity58 believes @entity15 is only now reaching the critical stage of his development			1
@entity15 is a tricky no 10 with the poise and guile to run games in the final third @entity15 with a pre-season trophy ( left ) and in @entity4 's away kit ( right ) @entity79 legend @entity78 poses with @entity15 at the club 's training ground @entity15 has similar qualities to @entity83 cutting off the left winger @entity85 is said to have lent harper a helping hand during his formative years at the @entity87 ‘ people might look at the fact he is playing for @entity4 and think it his progress is automatic , but that ’s not the case , ’ @entity58 told @entity88			1
‘ there is still a lot of work for @entity15 to do before he can step up to the under - 21s or even the @entity99			1
he is not there yet			0
‘ he is in the most important part of his pathway			0
between 18 and 20 , so many things can go wrong			0
‘ do you have an opportunity to play first - team football ? do you have a manager who is brave enough ? how do you deal with stronger defenders ? how do you cope with everyone expecting you to be fantastic ? ‘ @entity15 is definitely very talented and has the right mind - set , very down to earth			2
every ingredient is there but he also has to take some really big steps to become the player everyone hopes he might be			0
@entity116 could be tempted to throw @entity15 into the deep end in @entity119 qualifying @entity4 spotted the @entity120 under 17 international when he was just 13 ‘ this is his last year in youth football with @entity4			1
probably in the second part of this season , they will decide whether he will go on loan to their b team @entity128 or still play for the under - 19s			0
‘ @entity15 also has to finish secondary school and take a decision on whether to study or just focus on football			2
‘ but if you start for @entity4 under - 19s in an important game , score a goal and have an assist you are not doing too bad , are you ? ’ @entity58 has previously spoken about some similarities between @entity15 and a teenage @entity139			1
as well as signifying ability , it is also a note of the hurdles he will have to overcome			0
‘ i spoke with the people at @entity4 when i was out there and we are not yet sure where @entity15 ’s best position is – is he a no 9 or a no 10 ? ’ said @entity58			1
‘ i worked with @entity139 ( at @entity149 ) and he was a similar style of player – left - footed and long - legged			2
sometimes you did n’t see him for 20 minutes then he did something magnificent			0
‘ the discussion was always about where to put @entity139			2
eventually he ended up being a top no 9 but there were a lot of seasons when he did n’t fit the system			0
‘ do n’t get me wrong , i am not saying @entity15 is going to be the next @entity139			1
but there are similarities in terms of the style and the issues at that age			0
‘ there are lot of very good things about @entity15 but there is also a lot he needs to improve on and i ’m sure he ’s working hard on that			0
’ @entity173 pleased with @entity4 reaction			0
