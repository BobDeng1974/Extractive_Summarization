prosecutors also used phone conversations recorded between @entity4 and his wife @entity68 , to show that the pair intentionally deceived the court by talking in code that designates multiples of thousands to much lower sums			1
@entity4 asks : ' in my account do i have at least $ 100 ? @entity102 responds : ' $ 8			1
$ 8.60 ' defense attorney @entity78 said the fact that @entity4 and his wife never used the money for anything indicated ' there was no deceit			1

@entity142 was asked if he thought that if @entity4 would be willing to lie about his finances that he would be willing to lie about what happen the night @entity17 was killed			2
' we fully expect that the special prosecutor will make @entity4 's credibility be front and center in this entire case , ' @entity142 said			0
' and whatever dishonesty that comes forth by @entity4 that they can prove , you can best believe it will be the issue of this case and rightfully so			0
prosecutors also said @entity4 had failed to surrender a second passport , but the judge dismissed that concern as the equivalent of someone who has lost a driver 's license , applies for a new one and then finds the old driver 's license			1

the 28 - year - old 's bond hearing was on april 20 , where the amount of money the website had raised was not disclosed			1
@entity4 was released from jail on april 23 on a $ 150,000 bond after paying 10 per cent upfront			2

@entity78 said friday on a website that he does n't expect the case to be ready for trial until next year			2
@entity78 said he expects to call on 50 witnesses who need to be deposed before he decides whether to file a " stand your ground " motion which would ask for a hearing before a judge without a jury			1
at the hearing , @entity4 would argue self - defense under the @entity11 law which gives wide latitude to use deadly force rather than retreat in a fight if people believe they are in danger of being killed or seriously injured .			1
