from the recently expanded family enclosure at @entity1 , a dad and lad can watch the biggest names in all 19 @entity6 games at @entity7 for £ 417			1
granted , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 will not be playing in the black and white stripes of @entity1 , but they are among the star attractions at this sporting cathedral			2
@entity1 ’s family section has a capacity of 8,200 and is the biggest in the @entity6 , possibly in @entity18 , too			1
a five - game package , starting this saturday against @entity32 and followed by @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 , starts at £ 105 for adults , £ 25 for juniors			0
they are putting the fans first			0
sadly @entity41 , the owner of @entity1 , has put newspaper groups and the reporters who work for them last , but we will come back to that			1
this saturday , when the team bottom of the @entity6 take on @entity47 ’s @entity32 , the atmosphere inside @entity7 threatens to be venomous			1
everybody , it seems , is out for @entity41 and his manager @entity19			1
all is not well , that much is clear after a 4 - 0 defeat at @entity53 ( where they were beaten by the same score last season ) led to one banner proclaiming ‘ @entity19 is a @entity58 ’			1
since january 1 , this team have won just five games in the @entity6 ( @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity32 , @entity63 and @entity64 )			2
all of them were last season			0
over the weekend , when @entity41 spoke with @entity19 following their thumping at @entity69 ’s , the owner told him he would not be judged on the four league games they have played this season			1
. in any event there is a penalty clause in the eight - year contract @entity19 signed in september 2012 and he will be entitled to £ 5m in compensation should @entity41 decide to sack him			1
some statistics on @entity41 ’s regime : in the accounts published in february , @entity1 ’s wage bill is down to 64 per cent of turnover ( down from 91 per cent when he took over in may 2007 )			1
they paid £ 61.7m in salaries last season , falling into line with @entity89 regulations			0
@entity41 can not be faulted for prudence and he wo n’t blow his brains out paying super-sized salaries when the club does n’t have the income to sustain them			1
@entity1 fans made their feelings known during the 4 - 0 defeat at @entity53 with this banner the @entity1 supporters have reached the end of their tether with @entity19 and most want him out video @entity19 on the edge @entity1 's horrible 2014 so far ... january 1 - @entity105 ( a ) lost 1 - 0 january 18 - @entity61 ( a ) won 3 - 1 january 28 - @entity106 ( a ) drew 0 - 0 february 1 - @entity107 ( h ) lost 3 - 0 february 8 - @entity36 ( a ) lost 3 - 0 february 12 - @entity108 ( h ) lost 4 - 0 february 23 - @entity62 ( h ) won 1 - 0 march 1 - @entity32 ( a ) won 4 - 1 march 15 - @entity110 ( a ) lost 1 - 0 march 22 - @entity111 ( h ) won 1 - 0 march 25 - @entity113 ( h ) lost 3 - 0 march 29 - @entity53 ( a ) lost 4 - 0 april 5 - @entity114 ( h ) lost 4 - 0 april 12 - @entity116 ( a ) lost 1 - 0 april 19 - @entity117 ( h ) lost 2 - 1 april 28 - @entity118 ( a ) lost 3 - 0 may 3 - @entity64 ( h ) won 3 - 0 may 11 - @entity34 ( a ) lost 2 - 1 2014 - 15 august 17 - @entity120 ( h ) lost 2 - 0 august 23 - @entity62 ( a ) drew 0 - 0 august 30 - @entity111 ( h ) drew 3 - 3 september 13 - @entity53 ( a ) lost 4 - 0 an interest - free loan from the owner of £ 129m is still showing on the financial statement for the 2012 - 13 season			1
it is the only significant debt at the club			0
the days of @entity127 for the @entity127 are long gone in an era of financial restrictions and responsibilities at @entity1			2
there is a hangover from last season , when seven defeats in the last eight games in the @entity6 set the tone			2
after @entity138 , easily the club ’s most influential player , was sold to @entity140 for £ 19m on january 29 , the team jacked it in for the season			0
@entity19 ’s shameful headbutt on @entity144 in march ( leading to a £ 100,000 fine from the club , a formal warning and a touchline ban ) affected his standing in the dressing room			2
winning it back will not be easy			0
the manager 's frustrations in the transfer market this summer , missing out on @entity155 ( now at @entity117 ) and @entity156 ( @entity53 ) , are the life of a manager			0
you win some , you lose some			0
so far a clutch of new signings - @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 - have shown little so far			0
still , it is early days for all of them			0
this is not a vintage @entity1 team by any stretch of the imagination , but new signings - particularly from overseas - deserve time to settle			2
for every @entity174 there is a @entity175			0
@entity41 has been criticised by @entity1 fans but has been prudent with the club 's finances much has been made of @entity19 ’s failure to take the team beyond the fourth round of either the @entity182 or @entity183 since his arrival in december 2010			1
fair enough , but two years ago they played 14 matches in the @entity187 before they were finally beaten by @entity188 in the quarter - final			0
in isolation , 12th , fifth , 16th and 10th placed finishes in the @entity6 does n’t seem so bad			2
in terms of expectations , @entity1 fans demand the very best from the team , just like every other group of supporters			1
the manager is not popular , that much is clear with the various campaigns designed to unseat him from one of the most prestigious jobs in football			0
so what of @entity41 ? he ’s taken to banning newspapers , which is a shame because he ’s had bigger battles over the years than a few issues with the press			2
‘ @entity215 ’ , as some communications directors at @entity6 clubs have taken to calling the fascination with every day - to - day detail , is part of the game			0
the sparkle is missing at @entity7 , something @entity19 is acutely aware of as he approaches this weekend ’s clash with @entity32			1
after four years of fall - outs , the idea of a family get - together is a long way off			0
@entity19 ( right ) shows the strain as his @entity1 side are given a thrashing at @entity53			1

@entity1 supporters want rid of @entity41 and @entity19
@entity1 held up banners proclaiming ' @entity19 is a @entity58 '
@entity41 has brought some financial prudence to @entity7
*newcastle* are trying things to win back the supporters
club are offering cheap tickets to fans to see @entity6 stars
