an 11 - year - old girl whose lips became so chapped they bled at school is now petitioning the district to let her use lip balm			1
@entity5 , a fifth - grader at @entity6 in @entity7 , has suffered from dry lips for years and and repeatedly her requests for @entity10 have been turned down because the district considers the ointment an ' over-the - counter drug ' that require 's a doctor 's note and must be held by the school nurse			1
after a particularly painful episode , when @entity5 was refused @entity10 yet again and had to wet her cracking lips in the bathroom sink , she decided it was time to take action			1
@entity5 asked the board to consider changing the policy , calling it ' inappropriate '			0
her father , @entity34 , serves as @entity36 district supervisor			0
' i do n't believe there is anything inside a generic @entity10 that would be classified as a drug , ' he told @entity41			2
' we would like the exception to be made so that kids in school can carry @entity10			2
' after her speech , the board cross-examined @entity5 with one member pointing out that the lip balm could be considered a distraction in class			1
expression : @entity5 started a petition and got over 300 signatures			1
she presented her case to the school board last week ' she said , " i think it would be more distracting to have bleeding lips while i 'm doing my work , " ' mr @entity34 recalled			1
' that ended that line of questioning			0
' the school board continues to review @entity5 's petition			1
in the meantime she plans to send thank you letters to the entire board , with a @entity10 tube included			0
assistant superintendent @entity71 says the policy concerning lip balm was put in place after a disease outbreak			2
' our policy is not to be so restrictive			0
it is really a protection for the students , ' he told the @entity82			0
@entity6 students can still use @entity10 , but they must first obtain a doctor 's note , and then it must be kept in the nurse 's office and applied there			0
the school shares a space with a pre-kindergarden , and there are also fears that the tubes could be accidentally passed to the small children .			0

@entity5 , 11 , has been denied @entity10 at school for years , and one time her lips became so dry they bled
@entity101 does n't allow students to carry around lip balm because it 's considered an ' over-the - counter drug '
the fifth - grader started a petition to change the rule and got 300 signatures , which she put before the school board last week
