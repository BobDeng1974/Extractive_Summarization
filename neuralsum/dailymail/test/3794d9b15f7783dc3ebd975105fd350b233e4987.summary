doctors solved the mystery behind an @entity4 man 's kidney failure after discovering he loved downing a gallon of iced tea every day			1
medical professionals at the @entity8 in @entity9 ruled out several causes for a 56 - year - old man 's kidney problems before blaming the 16 cups of iced tea he drank daily			1
black tea has high levels of oxalate , a chemical known to produce kidney stones and even lead to kidney failure if consumed in excessive doses			1
the man was admitted to the hospital in may complaining of nausea , weakness , fatigue and body aches			0
the chemical oxalate was found to have clogged the man 's kidneys , to the point that they had become inflamed			2
with a habit of drinking about 16 8 - ounce cups of iced tea every day , the unidentified man was consuming anywhere from 3 to 10 times the amount an average @entity45 takes in			2
the 16 - daily - cups habit was striking on its own , since federal studies have found that the average @entity45 adult drinks about 10 to 11 cups of liquid every day , including water , coffee and other beverages			0
@entity25 said she did n't know whether the man was drinking sweet tea , a concoction made from black tea and a hefty serving of sugar that is popular in the @entity60 , though he was diabetic			2
the @entity28 has cited black tea in health issues before , publishing a 2013 case that found a 47 - year - old woman had developed a bone disease from drinking a pitcher of tea made from 100 to 150 bags of tea every day			1
the @entity4 man 's case , however , does not suggest health risks for most people , according to dr @entity73 , a @entity75 kidney specialist			0
' i would n't tell people to stop drinking tea , ' said @entity73 , who has treated patients with oxalate - related kidney damage			0
that man drank ' a lot of tea			0

doctors at the @entity8 found a 56 - year - old man 's kidney problems *stemmed* from drinking too much iced tea
black tea contains oxalate , a chemical known to produce kidney stones and sometimes lead to kidney failure
the unidentified man will likely spend the rest of his life in *dialysis*
