@entity6 president @entity56 hopes the rules would stop domestic champions in the major @entity60 leagues being ranked lower than other clubs from their nations			0
it would also prevent situations like in this season 's @entity65 where the champions of @entity43 ( @entity42 ) , @entity36 ( @entity35 ) , @entity68 ( @entity69 ) and @entity70 ( @entity71 ) are all in together			0
the plan needs approval from the @entity6 executive committee - whose next meeting is on september 18 - before it can be introduced but it is hoped it would take effect from next season			2
the system currently works on the co-efficient system , where clubs ' previous @entity3 performances and the ranking of their domestic league is taken into account .			0
