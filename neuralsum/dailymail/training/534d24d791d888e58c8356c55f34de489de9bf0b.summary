@entity0 declared himself satisfied with the perfect comeback after playing an integral part in the demolition of @entity4 that @entity6 hope will kick - start their @entity8 challenge			1
' it could n't have gone much better really , ' said @entity0 after taking four wickets in the thumping tri-series win at the @entity12			1
' i was just happy to get out there , get a competitive game under my belt and come through it unscathed			2
@entity0 celebrates taking the wicket of @entity4 's @entity19 in tuesday 's @entity21 match @entity0 ( right ) posted this picture with @entity23 ( left ) and @entity24 as @entity6 arrived in @entity25 ' i was delighted to be back in the team and with the wickets , that was a bonus			1
it 's just one game , my first game back and it went really well but i 've still got a lot of work to do			2
' not just myself , but as a team too			2
we want to build on what was such a good performance and hopefully we can do that on friday			1
' @entity0 missed the one - day tour of @entity37 before @entity38 with a knee injury and found his body protesting when he made his comeback in @entity6 's first warm - up game of this @entity8 tour			1
it forced him to miss the opening defeat by @entity46 in @entity47			2
' the knee has been fine , ' he insisted			1
' i 've not had any issues with that for a while now			2
it 's just everything else that seems to stiffen up and niggles crop up			2
' i feel strong at the minute and just to get through yesterday was really good for me			0
to spend 40 - odd overs in the field was progress and hopefully i can get through a full 50 on friday			0
' @entity0 took four wickets as @entity6 comfortable beat @entity4 by nine wickets in @entity60 @entity0 celebrates after @entity61 takes the catch to dismiss @entity4 's @entity63 at the @entity12 the biggest plus of @entity6 's nine - wicket win against the defending @entity8 champions was the man - of - the - match display from @entity24 , who took five wickets in a city he was sent home from this time last year when he was deemed ' unselectable ' for the @entity73 tour			1
@entity0 , who took a while on the periphery before he became @entity6 's attack leader , can empathise after his early travails in an @entity6 shirt			1
' there definitely are similarities , ' said @entity0			1
' i 've chatted to him about it quite a bit			0
we 've worked together a reasonable amount on this tour so far			0
' he 's worked so hard off the field , trying to get himself back to the form we know he can produce			0
everyone was delighted for him yesterday , it was a fantastic performance from him			1
' saying that he 's a very humble , honest guy and he knows it 's just one performance and he 's got a lot of hard work to do to keep improving on that			2
' @entity24 was @entity6 's star performer on tuesday , taking five wickets as @entity4 were comfortably beaten @entity24 celebrates with his @entity6 team - mates after taking the wicket of @entity99 but @entity6 were delighted with a victory they badly needed at this early stage of a tour where they have been dismissed as @entity8 no - hopers			1
now they are preparing to meet @entity46 on friday here at the @entity105			0
' it 's huge for us , ' said @entity0			1
' we 're still developing as a team			0
there 's a lot of belief in the dressing room			0
we know we 've got a huge amount of talent and the ability to upset teams like we did yesterday , beating the best in the world			0
' yesterday was a great performance but it 's one game and we know we 've got a lot of hard work and improving to do			2
that starts tomorrow and hopefully we can continue the good work on friday			0
' @entity46 will be without @entity125 in @entity25 but they insist he is being rested with a sore hamstring rather than being disciplined for the latest of the many spats that have punctuated his career			0
@entity125 's clash with @entity132 of @entity4 in @entity133 sparked a huge debate about player behaviour in cricket			1
@entity0 , as @entity6 's chief sledger , is well qualified to speak on the subject			1
@entity46 's @entity125 made the headlines for his spat with @entity4 's @entity132 ( right ) last weekend ' of course there 's a line and i think all players are aware of that , ' said @entity6 's leading international wicket - taker			1
' i do n't think at the moment there is any more sledging than there 's been in the history of cricket , it 's something that 's gone on for years and years			0
there 's a spotlight on it a little bit more - stump mics and lots of cameras on the ground			0
' i think guys have got to use their heads a little bit and be a bit smart about what is said on the field , if anything is said at all			0
' you do n't want to take away the aggression from teams , i think we showed yesterday we were really aggressive with the ball all the way through and there was very little said at all			0
' i do n't think it should disappear from the game , i think it 's quite entertaining when it 's done in the right manner			0
