a glass pane at @entity2 's new transparent walkway 140ft above the @entity3 , has smashed after a visitor dropped a bottle of beer			1
just two weeks after the new attraction opened , one of the six half - tonne glass panes that make up the floor , was damaged by visitors			1
the dropped bottle of beer caused an initial crack , but a woman walking over the broken glass in stiletto heels reportedly caused the pane to shatter further			1
' officials at the attraction have rushed to reassure visitors , stating that the broken glass was just a ' sacrificial ' layer			2
the transparent walkway is made up of five layers of glass in each pane and it was just the top one which was damaged			2
the glass platform stretches across @entity47 's high - level walkways – nearly 140ft above the @entity3 however , @entity2 head @entity48 told @entity49 : ' we are gutted it 's happened in the first couple of weeks when it 's been open to the public but it 's completely safe			1
' we should have said no glass on the glass section of the floor			0
it was a bit shortsighted of us			0
' the top layer was designed to be easily replaceable in the event of scratches or damage and the attraction remained open despite the shattered pane			2
following the incident on friday night , the cracked pane was then covered with a mat for the remainder of the weekend , with a plan for it to be repaired on sunday night			0
@entity20 was at an event when he spotted the smashed pane in the walkway the new attraction has opened at the top section of @entity2 , 140ft over the @entity3 one half of the £ 1million walkway opened to the public two weeks ago between the north and south towers of the bridge and will be joined on december 1 by a parallel walk alongside it			1
they have been designed to give tourists , sightseers and thrill - seekers a unique view from a bridge that bills itself as the most famous in the world , not forgetting a peek at the workings of a legendary feat of engineering when the bridge below opens			0
each glass panel along the 36ft walkway is getting on for three inches thick and weighs nearly 1,200lb			0
@entity47 executives insist the idea is to enthral rather that scare people , simply offering a different view of the city .			0
