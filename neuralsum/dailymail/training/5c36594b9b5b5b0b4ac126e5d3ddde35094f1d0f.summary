king @entity0 did plan to be buried in @entity1 , not @entity2 , a new letter unearthed in the @entity4 suggests			1
the extraordinary letter , discovered by historian and @entity8 mp @entity7 , provides fresh ammunition to those who believe the @entity0 was establishing a major new religious foundation at @entity12 with a view to it becoming his mausoleum			1
it shows that @entity0 wanted the 100 priests at the new foundation to use their prayers to make him ‘ more acceptable to @entity19 and his saints ’			0
a painting of @entity0 from the 16th @entity22 housed in the @entity23 in @entity24 writing in tomorrow ’s edition of @entity26 , mr @entity7 says the letter , written five months before his death , suggests @entity0 ’s ‘ real intention ’ in establishing the college at @entity1 may have been to follow the 15th century trend for aristocrats to turn similar foundations into mausoleums			1
he says : ‘ the connection between @entity0 ’s establishment of the foundation at @entity1 and the salvation of his own soul could hardly be any clearer			1
’ @entity41 has won the tussle to provide the final resting place for @entity0 following a lengthy court battle in which campaigners claimed he wanted to be buried at @entity12 , the case was thrown out , with the @entity49 ruling there was ‘ no public law case ’ to interfere with the decision to bury the @entity0 in @entity2 , where his bones were found under a car park in 2012			1
but the new letter threatens to reopen the debate over whether he should rightly be buried at @entity12			0
the document , which has lain undiscovered for centuries , gives a fresh insight into @entity0 ’s decision to establish a 100 - strong college of priests at @entity1			2
the letter , dated 2 march 1485 , records the @entity0 angrily demanding that the priests be paid so that they can pray for him			2
the @entity0 points out to the authorities at the @entity67 that the have been given powers to ‘ ask , gather and levy all and any sum … to sustain and bear the charge of the finding of a hundred priests now being of our foundation ’			0
stressing the personal importance of the issue , he warns he is ‘ not willing our said priests to be unpaid of their wages , seeing by their prayers we trust to be made more acceptable to @entity19 and his saints ’			0
this letter by @entity0 , dated 2 march 1485 , suggests he wanted to establish a major new religious foundation at @entity12 with a view to it becoming his mausoleum mr @entity7 , author of ‘ @entity87 , ’ said @entity0 ’s comments suggest his intentions at @entity1 may have been ‘ to follow the growing trend for 15th century aristocrats across @entity92 to establish their own chantry foundations and , ultimately , mausoleums			1
’ he told the @entity95 that the letter was significant because it came at a time when @entity0 was ‘ in a dark place ’			2
he said : ' this is an intriguing insight into the mind of @entity0 , and demonstrates there are still new finds to be made in the archives			0
' at the time of writing the letter , @entity0 's queen was mortally ill , and would die two weeks later			0
the king may have been contemplating his own mortality , especially with the growing threat of @entity110 who would invade just five months later			0
' it does n't prove that @entity0 wished to be buried at @entity1 , but it certainly raises interesting questions over the king 's own piety and intentions			2
’ scientists at the @entity118 said this skeleton found under @entity121 car park in @entity2 was that of @entity0 mr @entity7 said that , despite the discovery , he personally favoured burial of @entity0 at @entity2 on the ‘ finders , keepers principle ’			1
@entity0 was killed at the @entity126 in 1485			1
he was buried in a @entity2 church , but the building was lost to later development			0
his bones were then discovered under a @entity2 car park in 2012			1
authorities in @entity2 have said they will reinter his body with ‘ dignity and honour ’			0
but a campaign group , the @entity136 , claimed @entity1 was a more suitable location for @entity0 's remains as he had spent his childhood and much of his adult life in the @entity141 .			0
