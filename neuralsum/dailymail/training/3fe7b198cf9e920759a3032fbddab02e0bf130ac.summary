@entity92 , @entity93 , 18 hours ago he should be restrained from contacting her for life not 12 measly months ! @entity96 , @entity97 , 18 hours ago unfortunately i do n't think this boy will change his attitude and he will have serious problems in the future ! @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , 18 hours ago he should have been given a suspended sentence , which would not have been subject to early release , and a 20 year criminal record			1
