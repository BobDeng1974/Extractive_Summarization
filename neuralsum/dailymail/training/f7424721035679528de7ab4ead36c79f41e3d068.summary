by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 supremo @entity2 is again ready to run @entity3 on a full - time basis after ridding himself of what he described as ' three and a half years of aggravation '			1
after spending three months on trial in a @entity9 district court on charges of bribery and incitement to breach of trust , on tuesday @entity2 paid a £ 60million settlement to end the case			1
@entity17 state law allows defendants to make such a payment , with no presumption of innocence or guilt , to a non-profit making organisation , or the treasury			0
it was not the scenario @entity2 envisaged as he was determined to prove his innocence , but with the trial exacting a toll , the 83 - year - old and his defence team decided to make the offer			1
' the bottom line is it 's been three and a half years of aggravation , travelling , meeting lawyers , and @entity56 knows what else , so it is good it is out of the way , ' said @entity2 , speaking to @entity1			1
' this trial has been going on for two days a week and it was going to go on until october			0
' when you 're trying to run businesses it 's not easy trying to resolve things when you 're dealing with lawyers			0
' settlement : @entity2 paid £ 60m to end the case , with £ 68.6m going directly to the @entity31 state and the remainder to a @entity31 charity that looks after terminally ill children in 2006 , @entity31 regional bank @entity70 sold their 47.2 per cent stake in @entity3 to private equity firm , and the current majority shareholders , @entity74			1
prosecutors claim @entity2 paid @entity76 , formerly the chief risk officer of @entity70 , a bribe of £ 26m to steer the sale to @entity74			1
@entity2 claimed he was being ' shaken down ' by @entity76 who was threatening to inform @entity79 he controlled an offshore family trust known as @entity2			2
although @entity2 has continually insisted the trust is not in his name , if an investigation had uncovered to the contrary he would have been liable for a tax bill of around £ 2billion			1
@entity89 for @entity2 , if the trial had run its course through to october , in all likelihood he would have been acquitted			2
consultation : @entity2 talks to his lawyer @entity91 after arriving in court on tuesday in summation , after deliberating for three hours on the offer made by the defence and agreed by the prosecution , presiding judge @entity93 declared : ' the charges could not be substantiated			2
' @entity2 added : ' in the end what has happened today is good and bad - the good is the judge more or less said i was acquitted , and they ( the prosecution ) really did n't have a case			1
' so i was a bit of an idiot to do what i did to settle because it was n't with the judge , it was with the prosecutors			0
' anyway , it 's done and finished , so it 's all right			0
i 'm content , it 's all fine			0
this now allows me to do what i do best , which is running @entity3			0
' in january , to alleviate his workload with the trial then looming , he agreed to stand down from a number of directorial positions on companies related to @entity3 , including the main board			2
now , @entity2 said ' i stood down for obvious reasons , but i 'll be back on again now			0
everything is back to normal			0
