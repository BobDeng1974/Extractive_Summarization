they may not be the most elegant of names , but they are certainly eye - catching			2
and no one could blame the postman if he titters when he 's delivering letters to homes in @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 or @entity10			2
now someone has created an interactive map of the world 's most suggestive place names - and probably become a hero to immature teenagers everywhere			1
@entity17 can be spotted on the map , which will surely become a much loved website of anyone with an infantile sense of humour @entity23 's @entity17 may raise eyebrows with its unfortunate name - but at least it will give residents a laugh those living in @entity29 , @entity28 must surely be tired of seeing people smirk when they tell them where they live perhaps @entity8 's name put residents off staying there - as the lonely looking area in @entity28 is deserted among the others highlighted on the map are @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42 in @entity43 and @entity44 in @entity45			1
and if those were n't enough to prompt a snigger , there 's @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity51 in the @entity52 and @entity53 in @entity54			0
there are places with names to make you blush - but you 'll have to find them yourselves			1
the map titled @entity61 was created by geographer and @entity64 's director of places @entity66 from south - west @entity67			1
toilet humour : the town of @entity38 in @entity70 is certain to prompt a chuckle from those with an imaginative mind poo in @entity70 has a beach - and is considered to be a far nicer place than its name might initially suggest a high point of the map is @entity80 , @entity81 - which might conjure up a couple of images that homeowners there do n't want you to think about @entity9 in @entity81 is sure to be popular with those roaming the map for more giggles @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 @entity92 , @entity93 @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 @entity97 , @entity28 @entity98 , @entity28 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity96 @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity91 @entity103 , @entity104 @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity96 mr @entity66 modestly describes his work as ' a classic web 2.0 style maps mashup [ that will ] never win any awards for originality or innovativeness '			1
' maybe it 's part of bring @entity96 , but an airport whose code is @entity7 is just â€¦ funny , ' he said			0
' the source of each of these vaguely rude sounding names was from @entity123 's woe data set , before the data was released via the @entity125 and ( currently offline ) @entity127 download			0
' a list of real but amusing sounding place names , culled from @entity125 by one of the old @entity132 team , has been sitting in a file on one of my backup drives for too many years now			0
' but given a geographic data set			0
@entity145 's wonderful @entity144 map tiles and a @entity146 , in this case @entity141 , the temptation to make a map out of it all was just too strong			1
' yes it 's a map , yes it 's geographical innuendo and yes , it 's very much part of the @entity96 sense of humour			2
' if you 're @entity96 , try not to snigger too much ; if you 're not @entity96 , just shake your head sadly and mutter " those crazy @entity155 "			0
' the @entity96 has more than its fair share of rude place names , not least @entity158 in @entity159 @entity160 , snigger : bum , in @entity162 , west @entity163 , would make most schoolboys laugh @entity165 in @entity166 , @entity107 , is one of the more polite place names intercourse in @entity170 , @entity91 , is another place with a very unfortunate name			0

have you been to @entity38 in @entity70 , @entity42 in @entity43 or @entity44 in @entity45 ?
