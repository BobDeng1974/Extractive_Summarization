' @entity62 thought his mom was spending too much money , she was spending his inheritance , ' assistant u.s. attorney @entity103 said in court in april			2
the @entity108 said that throughout the ordeal , he was not left with nothing , as he had always had his own six - figure trust fund and received a $ 3,900 monthly stipend			0

at first , it was a stripper named @entity125 who he met in the 1990s when she was stripping while going to college in @entity150			0
