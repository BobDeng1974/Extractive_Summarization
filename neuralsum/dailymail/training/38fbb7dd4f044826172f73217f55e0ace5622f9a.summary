by @entity1 reporter published : 11:14 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 11:47 est , 26 september 2013 @entity2 lost his appeal against a war - crimes conviction today as judges confirmed a 50 - year jail term against the former @entity8 president			1
the appeals chamber of the @entity10 confirmed @entity2 's conviction on 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity , including terrorism , murder , rape and using child soldiers			1
that makes him the first former head of state convicted by an international court since @entity23 of @entity25 leaders after the @entity26			1
convicted : former @entity8 president @entity2 , left , at the @entity10 for his appeal judgment at the @entity28 today , where judges confirmed his 50 - year sentence for crimes against humanity he now faces spending the rest of his life behind bars , with the @entity35 among the nations offering to hold the convicted war criminal			1
if he is sent to @entity35 he is expected to be a ' category a ' inmate suited only for a maximum security prison , with a cost to the @entity35 taxpayer of up to Â£ 80,000 a year			1
the court 's ruling today comes more than a decade after @entity2 helped rebels go on a murderous rampage across war - torn @entity45 , raping , murdering and mutilating tens of thousands of innocent victims			1
' brutal violence ' : presiding judge @entity50 said @entity2 had aided and abetted savage crimes committed by militants in @entity45 presiding judge @entity50 said @entity2 had aided and abetted crimes committed by @entity54 and @entity56 rebels , while knowing well the kinds of crimes they were committing			1
' their primary purpose was to spread terror			1
brutal violence was purposefully unleashed against civilians with the purpose of making them afraid , afraid that there would be more violence if they continued to resist , ' he said			1
' governments and the international community were also afraid that unless the @entity54 and the @entity56 demands were met , thousands more killings , mutilations , abductions and rapes of civilians would follow			2
' @entity2 , 65 , dressed in a crisp suit , gold coloured tie , gold cufflinks and gold - rimmed lasses , sat impassively throughout the hour - long reading of the appeals judgment at the @entity84 - backed court in the @entity28			2
the court found @entity2 provided crucial aid to rebels in @entity45 during that country 's 11 - year civil war , which left an estimated 50,000 people dead before its conclusion in 2002			1
thousands more were left mutilated in a conflict that became known for its extreme cruelty , as rival rebel groups hacked off the limbs of their victims and carved their groups ' initials into opponents			2
the rebels developed gruesome terms for the mutilations , offering victims the choice of ' long sleeves ' or ' short sleeves ' - having their hands hacked off or their arms sliced off above the elbow			2
prosecutors said he used the proceeds from so - called blood diamonds mined in the conflict zone to finance @entity2 's activities , which included advising and helping the rebels			2
during @entity2 's four - year initial trial , judges heard accounts from @entity45 civilians who had been mutilated by rebels or who had seen their close relatives murdered			1
they also heard evidence from supermodel @entity125 , who was questioned about blood diamonds @entity2 was accused of having sent to her hotel room			2
she described the objects she received as looking like ' dirty pebbles			2
' ' @entity130 pebbles ' : @entity125 is seen holding the bible being sworn in at the @entity10 , where she was questioned about blood diamonds @entity2 was accused of having sent to her hotel room in @entity45 's capital @entity136 , victims were jubilant			2
' it 's a victory for me against tyranny , ' said @entity141 , , who lost his lower left arm when rebels chopped it off with an axe			2
' i 'm happy @entity2 is behind bars for 50 years because i 'm a victim of the war			1
' ' @entity147 must stop in @entity148 , so i 'm very happy over the decision , ' he told the @entity150			2
' at 65 , i do n't know whether he will ever breathe the free air that i do breathe			0
' mr @entity141 , who today leads an organisation that aids war amputees , said @entity2 's sentence closed a chapter but that some 2,000 people still live with amputations and other serious injuries from the war			1
many live in abject poverty with little means to support their families			0
civil war : in this june 10 , 1997 file photo , soldiers from the @entity54 supported by @entity2 ride in a pick - up truck at their base on the outskirts of @entity136 , @entity45 the reaction back home : men gather at a popular downtown @entity174 tea shop known as a hotspot for political debate to watch the announcement of today 's appeal verdict @entity2 is the first former head of state convicted by an international war crimes court since the @entity26 and thursday 's confirmation was welcomed as underscoring a new era of accountability for heads of state			1
however , it also appeared to establish duelling sets of jurisprudence at two international courts on opposite sides of the @entity28 on the question of when senior officials can support one side in another country 's civil war - an issue world leaders must consider if they mull over arming rebels in @entity196			1
the @entity45 appeals panel rejected a controversial february ruling by the @entity199 for the @entity200 ( @entity201 ) , which said that to prove a leader has aided and abetted a crime , the assistance has to be specifically directed at committing a crime			0
in that case , the former chief of staff of the @entity208 national army was acquitted of aiding and abetting atrocities by @entity212 forces even though he had sent them arms and other supplies			0
@entity2 's case appeared to swing the pendulum back towards a lower burden of proof for prosecutors			0
his lawyer complained that the two rulings have created ' entirely chaotic jurisprudence ' at international tribunals			0
if @entity2 had been prosecuted by the @entity208 tribunal ' i dare say the outcome would have been different , and that courthouse is less than 10 kilometres ( six miles ) away from this courthouse , ' @entity224 said			0
but international law expert @entity230 , of @entity231 in @entity232 , @entity233 , said the ruling ' righted the ship ' after the @entity208 court had made prosecuting leaders who support rebels much more difficult			1
but @entity224 , @entity2 's lead defence lawyer , complained that @entity2 had been prosecuted because of a lack of friends in high places			0
referring to the diplomatic row over action against the regime in @entity196 , mr @entity224 said : ' but for two powerful nations , two members of the @entity247 and @entity249 - @entity248 would have been charged and indicted by the @entity250			0
that is not happening simply because of political reasons			0
' had @entity2 had as friends any of the five permanent members of the @entity247 ... this case i dare say would probably not have had the sort of traction it had			0
' because @entity196 is not a member of the @entity250 , only the @entity247 asking the court to investigate could trigger jurisdiction there			0
and @entity2 's supporters in @entity8 remained loyal to the former warlord who was later democratically elected the country 's president			1
the very idea of international courts has come under fire across @entity148			0
the @entity250 has been accused of neo-colonial meddling in @entity271 as it pursues cases against its president and deputy president			0
' this is complete international gangsterism , ' said @entity276 , former secretary general of @entity8 's @entity277			1
' the @entity250 was set up for @entity148 , to intimidate them and get their resources			0
' @entity2 's brother - in - law @entity279 said he was not surprised by the verdict			0
' from day one my position has been that the trial of mr @entity2 was orchestrated by the powers that be - the @entity286 powers , ' he told the @entity150			0
' this was an international conspiracy			0
' several @entity148 states are considering withdrawing from the @entity250 , which has only ever prosecuted @entity148 .			0
