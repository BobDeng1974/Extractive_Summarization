costumes , hair , makeup superb ! ' oh ... and too bad @entity43 gets @entity204 and @entity86 confused in his storytelling			0

this is what i really meant : @entity32 went online to clarify the difference between ' kinda reminded me ' and a direct comparison			0
he used apples and oranges as an example ' but there is also anti-war sentiment expressed in the movie			0
and there 's a touching ending as the main character is remembered after being gunned down by a fellow @entity53 vet with @entity131 who was given a gun at a gun range back home in @entity128 - and then used it to kill the man who called himself the ' @entity228 '			2
