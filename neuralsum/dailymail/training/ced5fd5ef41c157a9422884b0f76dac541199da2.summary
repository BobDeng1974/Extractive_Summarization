by @entity0 published : 03:33 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 05:47 est , 17 october 2013 mayor of @entity2 @entity1 has said @entity4 's work is not art and should not be allowed the mayor of @entity2 has said work created by @entity8 artist @entity4 is graffiti and should not be allowed			1
the mysterious @entity8 artist is staging a month - long ' residency ' in @entity2 carrying out a project called @entity13			1
however , mayor @entity1 has said defacing people 's property is not his definition of art. speaking at a press conference , he said : ' i 'll leave it up to our @entity22			1
' but look graffiti does ruin people 's property and it 's a sign of decay and loss of control			1
' nobody 's a bigger supporter of the arts than i am			2
i just think there are some places for art and there are som places ( not for ) art. ' you running up to somebody 's property or public property and defacing it is not my definition of art. ' or it may be art , but it should not be permitted			1
' and i think that ’s exactly what the law says			0
' @entity4 , a pseudonym for the elusive artist who first emerged in the streets of @entity52 and whose real identity is unknown , has become a coveted contemporary painter in the art world , known for his trademark spray - paint stencils on buildings that offer social commentary			1
his artwork can sell for six figure sums			0
he surprised even the most ardent fans earlier this week by secretly selling his authentic artworks near @entity63 for just $ 60 each on saturday			0
the artwork stand opened about midday with an inventory value estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars			0
yet over seven hours , just three people bought eight canvases - a total haul of $ 420			1
the first sale was at 3.30pm to a woman who bought two canvases for her children - and she managed to wrangle a 50 per cent discount			2
half an hour later , a @entity96 woman purchased some art. @entity98 shows the vendor embracing her warmly and kissing her cheek			0
at 5.30pm , a @entity102 man stopped saying he wanted art for his new house : ' i just need something for the walls			2
' he left with four original @entity108			0
the disinterested - looking vendor shut up shop at 6.30pm			2
each day during his @entity13 residency , @entity4 has posted a snapshot of his latest project and includes the location for fans to check out			2
the work varies from simple stencils to large , detailed murals			0
but four pieces of work have so far been destroyed by vandals			0
ruined : a @entity4 artwork which was destroyed by vandals last week @entity124 : @entity124 is another graffiti artist who is n't thrilled @entity4 is in @entity2 this month rat : the vandal who tagged this @entity4 piece left the message , ' we do n't need no more rats ! ' the latest hit were a stencil on the side of a building in @entity136 , @entity137 , and a car that was part of an installation on @entity140 on the @entity141			1
the @entity140 piece includes an actual car parked in front of a wall covered in horses wearing what appear to be night - vision goggles			2
on friday , a beaver stenciled on a wall in @entity151 by the elusive artist also was damaged			2
the piece , which depicted a beaver leaning up against a railing , was covered with spray paint that read ' we do n't need no more rats ! ' in red capital letters			0
the beaver 's face also had been chipped off			0
popular : @entity4 's signature humour is at home on the streets of @entity2 and his graffiti has attracted a swarm of attention original : this was @entity4 's @entity140 installation before it was damaged by vandals the vandalism was signed ' math , ' likely the name of another graffiti artist			1
earlier this month , rival graffiti artist ' @entity124 ' spray - painted over a @entity4 piece in @entity178 , @entity151			1
@entity4 's work getting vandalised is no surprise ; other graffiti artists - often jealous of his notoriety - will deface his work , many in misguided attempt to make a name for themselves			1
one of his most recent imprints on the city is an image of the @entity76 , painted on a @entity78 wall in black paint and adorned with a bright orange flower			1
on tuesday , a man tweeted several photos along with the message declaring : ' i found @entity4			0
' turf : a graffiti artist called ' @entity199 ' says this @entity4 piece was done on ' his territory ' twitter user @ @entity203 posted four photographs online showing a group of men and two trucks used for @entity4 ’s recent @entity208 and @entity210 mobile works of art. @entity212 said the photographs were taken at a warehouse in the @entity178 area of @entity151 and that he approached the men after recognising the vehicles from @entity4 ’s on - going month - long residency			1
the men refused to answer when @entity212 asked where @entity4 is , although he tweeted that he thought the man on top of the truck might be him since as he was directing the others and spoke with an @entity226 accent			0
the photographs were taken by twitter user @entity203 / @entity228 who believes that the man on top of the van could be @entity4 because he spoke with an @entity226 accent after his rather provocative declaration to having found @entity4 , @entity212 then backtracked on his claims after receiving a deluge of negative tweets from fans of the street artist who accused him of trying to jeopardize the remainder of @entity4 's month - long show			1
although the artist has never confirmed his identity , his real name is believed to be @entity244 and he is from @entity52 , @entity226			0
previously photographs purporting to show @entity4 were taken in @entity245 in 2011 and @entity246 in 2007			0
@entity4 , whose work has been painted on the sides of buildings around @entity52 , @entity246 and other cities , has always insisted he will never reveal his true identity .			0
