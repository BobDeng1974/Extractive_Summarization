@entity0 has unveiled a revolutionary type of wing that it says could save millions in air travel			1
the wing is able to morph itself like that of a bird to provide the same functionality as normal flaps , but with much less weight			1
it can also reportedly be used to increase fuel efficiency and even reduce noise on take - off and landing			1
the wing can bend from -2 degrees up to 30 degrees			1
it means that regular flaps are n't needed - and it is much lighter			1
in this image , the technology is visible at the flat ' flap at the base of the wing the latest test of the technology took place above @entity0 ’s @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity19			1
over the past six months , 22 research flights of the @entity34 ( @entity35 ) flight control surface has taken place			0
the project is a collaboration between @entity0 , the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) and @entity40 from @entity41			2
the wing is able to ‘ bend ’ through angles from -2 degrees up to 30 degrees			1
test pilots have described it as being ‘ very smooth ’ , while it can also deal with hard banking manoeuvres and extreme temperatures			0
for all the flights so far , the wing has flown in a fixed position on a @entity53 jet between these two extremes , to ensure risk is minimal			0
but for future flights , the wings will be able to change angles while in the air			0
the breakthrough could also increase fuel efficiency up to 12 per cent , and reduce noise at take - off and landing up to 40 per cent			1
the wing is shown above bending through its two extremes			0

credit : @entity40 figures suggest the breakthrough could increase fuel efficiency up to 12 per cent , and reduce noise at take - off and landing up to 40 per cent , compared to traditional wing flaps ( one shown on a @entity77 ) a transformer - style ‘ flying car ’ being developed by an @entity82 company could soon spell the end of runways			1
the company ’s vision is to build a vehicle with four rotors that allow it to take to the air anywhere like a helicopter - and then switch to fly like a normal plane			2
while this ‘ @entity93 ’ vehicle is still some way from development , the technology could soon become a reality in a functioning prototype dubbed the ‘ @entity98 ’			0
the @entity98 has four horizontal propellers that allow it to perform vertical take - offs and landings , and to hover in mid-air			0
‘ we are thrilled to have accomplished all of our flight test goals without encountering any significant technical issues , ’ said @entity39 program manager @entity103 , from @entity104 in @entity105			0
‘ these flights cap 17 years of technology maturation , beginning with @entity39 ’s initial @entity112 @entity114 contract with @entity40 , and the technology now is ready to dramatically improve aircraft efficiency for the @entity39 and the commercial aviation industry			2
’ the technology can be fitted to existing airplane wings , so it does not require a complete redesign of current aircraft wings			0
‘ the completion of this flight test campaign at @entity126 is a big step for @entity0 's @entity128 , ’ said @entity123 project manager @entity122			2
‘ this is the first of eight large - scale integrated technology demonstrations @entity123 is finishing up this year that are designed to reduce the impact of aviation on the environment			1
’ it will take years for such a technology to be approved for commercial aircraft , though , so it ’s unlikely to be used on planes any time soon			0
but the cost and fuel economy benefits will be appealing to many if testing continues smoothly .			0

@entity0 has been testing a flexible wing on a plane in @entity19
the wing can bend from -2 degrees up to 30 degrees
technology means that regular flaps are n't needed - and it is much lighter
it could increase fuel efficiency 12 **%** and reduce noise 40 **%**
