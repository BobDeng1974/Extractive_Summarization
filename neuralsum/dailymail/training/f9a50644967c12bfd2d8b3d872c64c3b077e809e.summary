it 's a milestone that few , if any , of us expect to reach			2
but the first person who will live to see their 150th birthday has already been born , according to a leading scientist			1
even more incredibly , @entity6 believes that the first person to live for 1,000 years will be born in the next two decades			1
mid-life crisis ? the first person who will live to see their 150th birthday has already been born , according to a leading scientist the biomedical gerontologist and chief scientist of a foundation dedicated to longevity research claims that within his own lifetime doctors will have all the tools they need to ' cure ' ageing			1
this will be done , he believes , by banishing all diseases and extending life indefinitely			1
dr @entity6 said : ' i 'd say we have a 50/50 chance of bringing ageing under what i 'd call a decisive level of medical control within the next 25 years or so			1
' and what i mean by decisive is the same sort of medical control that we have over most infectious diseases today			2
' the @entity33 scientist sees a time when people will go to their doctors for regular ' maintenance ' , which by then will include gene therapies , stem cell therapies , immune stimulation and a range of other advanced medical techniques to keep them in good shape			2
he is chief scientific officer of the non-profit @entity45 - based @entity44 ( @entity46 , which he co-founded in 2009			2
dr @entity6 describes aging as the life - long accumulation of various types of molecular and cellular damage throughout the body			1
' the idea is to engage in what you might call preventative geriatrics , where you go in to periodically repair that molecular and cellular damage before it gets to the level of abundance that is pathogenic , ' he said			2
dr @entity6 describes aging as the life - long accumulation of various types of molecular and cellular damage throughout the body exactly how far and how fast life expectancy will increase in the future is a subject of some debate , but the trend is clear			1
an average of three months is being added to life expectancy every year at the moment and experts estimate there could be a million centenarians across the world by 2030			0
to date , the world 's longest - living person on record lived to 122 and in @entity78 alone there were more than 44,000 centenarians in 2010			2
some researchers say , however , that the trend towards a longer lifespan may falter due to an epidemic of obesity now spilling over from rich nations into the developing world			0
dr @entity6 's ideas may seem far - fetched , but $ 20,000 offered in 2005 by the @entity88 journal for any molecular biologist who showed that @entity93 's @entity44 theory was ' so wrong that it was unworthy of learned debate ' was never won			1
the judges on that panel were prompted into action by an angry put - down of dr @entity6 from a group of nine leading scientists who dismissed his work as ' pseudo science '			1
they concluded that this label was not fair , arguing instead that @entity44 ' exists in a middle ground of yet - to - be - tested ideas that some people may find intriguing but which others are free to doubt '			0
for some , the prospect of living for hundreds of years is not particularly attractive , either , as it conjures up an image of generations of sick , weak old people and societies increasingly less able to cope			0
but dr @entity6 says that 's not what he 's working for			1
keeping the killer diseases of old age at bay is the primary focus			0
he said : ' this is absolutely not a matter of keeping people alive in a bad state of health			0
this is about preventing people from getting sick as a result of old age			0
' the particular therapies that we are working on will only deliver long life as a side effect of delivering better health			0
' dr @entity6 divides the damage caused by ageing into seven main categories for which repair techniques need to be developed if his prediction for continual maintenance is to come true			1
he notes that while for some categories , the science is still in its earliest stages , there are others where it 's already almost there			0
' stem cell therapy is a big part of this			0
it 's designed to reverse one type of damage , namely the loss of cells when cells die and are not automatically replaced , and it 's already in clinical trials ( in humans ) , ' he said			0
stem cell therapies are currently being trialled in people with spinal cord injuries , and dr @entity6 and others say they may one day be used to find ways to repair disease - damaged brains and hearts			1
cardiovascular diseases are the world 's biggest age - related killers and dr @entity6 says there is a long way to go on these though researchers have figured out the path to follow			1
heart diseases that cause heart failure , heart attacks and strokes are brought about by the accumulation of certain types of what @entity93 calls ' molecular garbage ' - byproducts of the body 's metabolic processes - which our bodies are not able to break down or excrete			0
' the garbage accumulates inside the cell , and eventually it gets in the way of the cell 's workings , he said			0
dr @entity6 is working with colleagues in the @entity195 to identify enzymes in other species that can break down the garbage and clean out the cells - and the aim then is to devise genetic therapies to give this capability to humans			1
' if we could do that in the case of certain modified forms of cholesterol which accumulate in cells of the artery wall , then we simply would not get cardiovascular disease , ' he said			0
dr @entity6 is reluctant to make firm predictions about how long people will be able to live in future , but he does say that with each major advance in longevity , scientists will buy more time to make yet more scientific progress			1
in his view , this means that the first person who will live to 1,000 is likely to be born less than 20 years after the first person to reach 150			1
' i call it longevity escape velocity - where we have a sufficiently comprehensive panel of therapies to enable us to push back the ill health of old age faster than time is passing			0
' and that way , we buy ourselves enough time to develop more therapies further as time goes on			0
' ' what we can actually predict in terms of how long people will live is absolutely nothing , because it will be determined by the risk of death from other causes like accidents , ' he added			2
' but there really should n't be any limit imposed by how long ago you were born			2
the whole point of maintenance is that it works indefinitely			0

dr @entity6 also believes that the first person to live to 1,000 will be born in the next two decades
