the avalanche hit at a site known as the @entity230 at more than 5,000 m altitude , as the climbers were ascending from the base camp to camp one as of saturday , @entity10 seemed unsure of whether he would continue his summit attempt on @entity6 - fulfilling his goal of climbing the tallest mountain on every continent			1
' early this morning i read a comment written about me where the author said , " i hope he finds what he 's looking for up there			0

but @entity10 may not have a choice in the matter			2

there are , however , no safer paths along the famous @entity339 route scaled by sir @entity340 and @entity341 in 1953			0
around 100 climbers and guides had already passed beyond the @entity230 to prepare their attempts on the summit			0
they are safe , but a new path will have to be made to make it possible to continue the expeditions			0
the area is considered particularly dangerous due to its steep slope and deep crevasses that cut through the snow and ice covering the pass year round			0
sherpas often make 20 - 25 round trips to carry kit and supplies to advanced camps , exposing them to greater risk			0
the most endangered are the so - called @entity362 - a team that maintains and fixes the route			0
authorities ruled out hope of finding any more survivors from the deadliest accident ever on the world 's highest peak ' it 's always the most dangerous part of the mountain to climb , because the ice is constantly moving , there are so many crevasses and seracs where you need to use ladders and ropes to get through the very technical terrain , ' @entity382 climber @entity381 , of @entity383 , told @entity384			1
it was first major avalanche of this year 's climbing season on @entity6 , which has been scaled by more than 4,000 climbers			1
the sherpa people are one of the main ethnic groups in @entity42 's alpine region , and many make their living as climbing guides on @entity6 and other @entity153 peaks			1
more than 4,000 climbers have summited @entity6 since 1953 , when it was first conquered by @entity397 @entity340 and sherpa @entity341			2
the worst recorded disaster on @entity6 had been a fierce blizzard on may 11 , 1996 , that caused the deaths of eight climbers , including famed mountaineer @entity403 , and was later memorialized in a book , ' @entity405 , ' by @entity406			2
six @entity42 guides were killed in an avalanche in 1970			0
earlier this year , @entity42 announced several steps to better manage the heavy flow of climbers and speed up rescue operations			0
the steps included the dispatch of officials and security personnel to the base camp at ( 5,300 meters ) 17,380 feet , where they will stay throughout the spring climbing season , which ends in may .			0

@entity10 of @entity11 was climbing up to @entity16 1 friday morning when the avalanche happened
