when 21 year old @entity2 student @entity1 stood up in a @entity2 product design class in april 2011 to present an idea for his final project , it was derided by his classmates as a ' terrible idea '			1
it was a mobile phone app designed to allow ' self destructing ' pictures that would disappear , without a trace , after a few seconds			2
today , @entity1 has hit 22 , and @entity12 is being used to send 50 million messages a day , while battling with @entity14 , which launched a similar app called ' poke '			1
the firm is even fending off @entity14 , who 's poke app has similar features			1
@entity23 , 24 , and @entity1 , 22 , the co-founders of @entity12 - which is holding its own against @entity14 ' everyone said , ‘ that is a terrible idea , ’ ' @entity1 said			1
' not only is nobody going to use it , they said , but the only people who do , will use it for sexting , ' he claimed			0
today , he is locked in a battle with @entity14 with @entity12 , his app - which is now used more than 50 million times a day			1
snapchat users open a special app to create their messages			2
they choose recipients from a list of friends , and can specify the lifespan of their picture and video messages - but once opened none can last longer than 10 seconds within the app. special effects and even text can also be added			0
he founded @entity12 with fellow student @entity23 , and employed two other students , @entity52 and @entity53 , and the core of the firm			1
the team 's headquarters are in @entity58 in @entity1 ’s father ’s house , where it will stay for the ' foreseeable future , ' although the firm is believed to be courting several @entity65 investors for a large round of funding			0
' it ’s not all about fancy vacations , sushi dinners , or beautiful sunsets , ' the team say about their product			0
' sometimes it ’s an inside joke , a silly face , or greetings from a pet fish , ' @entity12 ’s founders wrote in september			1
' great conversations are magical			0
' that ’s because they are shared , enjoyed but not saved			0
” it the months since @entity12 's launch it has become a huge success , with over 50 million messages a day sent , up from 20m in october , when it passed the 1bn total			2
it has also attracted the attention of @entity14 , leading to one of the most closely watched technological battle of the year , as @entity14 's new ' @entity14 ' app takes on @entity12 for the title of the internet 's top ' sexting ' app. the team regularly post pictures to their blog made using the app , such as this one celebrating co-founder @entity23 's 24th birthday			1
@entity14 , released before @entity102 , was the social - network ’s attempt to jump on the popularity of the apps that delete their messages automatically , which have led to many dubbing it a ‘ sexting ’ inappropriate material			1
despite being hit almost immediately with a privacy snafu when @entity14 founder @entity114 's sister complained over a snap of the family trying out the app , @entity111 has done well , shooting to the top of the download charts			2
@entity12 's team celebrating the first birthday of the app however , @entity14 ’s @entity111 has rapidly fallen down app popularity charts , despite a major @entity125 effort , which revealed that founder @entity114 had written code for the app himself and that it has been created in just days by a small team of engineers			1
@entity12 , however , has retained its spot near the top of the charts for the @entity135 and @entity136 versions of its app. even news that easily available tools allowed @entity143 users to save @entity12 videos , has failed to dent the rise of the app. @entity12 has risen to notoriety over the past year with many commentators accusing the service of promoting irresponsible sexual behaviour among teenagers			2
launched in september 2011 , it was reportedly inspired by the the humiliation of @entity155 politician @entity154 , who was caught sending explicit pictures of himself to a woman online			0
however , mr @entity1 has denied that his social media tool could promote sexting among youngsters			0
' i ’m not convinced that the whole sexting thing is as big as the media makes it out to be , ' he said			0
' i just do n’t know people who do that			0
it does n’t seem that fun when you can have real sex			0
' nevertheless , he has told @entity172 that the @entity12 team is ' trying to do a better job educating our users and their parents , ' and that he was looking to add more guidance materials to their website .			2

@entity12 set up by two @entity2 students , despite classmates ' *reservations*
service still hugely popular , even though @entity14 launched its own version
app yet to generate any revenue - and founders claim they are not selling
