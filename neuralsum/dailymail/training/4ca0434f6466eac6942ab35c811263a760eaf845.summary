last week @entity1 ceo @entity0 claimed that artificial intelligence was mankind ’s biggest threat			0
so he might not be too happy to hear that a company claims to have given a robot emotions for the first time via a microchip breakthrough			2
they say their artificially intelligent machine can recognise , emulate and empathise with the eight key emotions in humans			1
called @entity19 it can recognise and emulate the eight primary emotions using facial recognition ( shown right in image )			1
these are anger , fear , sadness , disgust , surprise , anticipation , trust and joy @entity14 , based in @entity15 and @entity32 , say they have achieved a major technological breakthrough with their @entity35 ( emotional processing unit )			1
this is the cornerstone of their new @entity38 product , a small £ 195 ( $ 315 ) cube that can recognise and respond to your emotions - and it even has emotions of its own			1
using the microchip and a camera , either through your phone or a separate external camera , the cube monitors your facial expressions and works out what you like and do n't like			1
the theory of emotion was devised by dr @entity54 ( 21 october 1927 to 29 april 2006 ) , who was a professor at the @entity55 in @entity32			0
he suggested there were eight basic primary emotions - anger , fear , sadness , disgust , surprise , anticipation , trust and joy - with the concept of emotion applicable to all animals			1
according to his theory all species have evolved farious emotions over time , some used to help them survive such as fear for ‘ @entity73 ’			2
but , he says , all other emotions are derived from these primary eight			2
thus , by having a machine recognise the eight basic emotions , it could theoretically replicate all other emotions			1
for example , when playing particular music it will see if you enjoy it or not			2
this will help it learn what you might enjoy in future			0
by syncing up to your phone the cube can then play songs , videos and more back to you if you make a request of it			1
but being mean or nice to the cube will also elicit a response from it			0
it is apparently able to emulate the eight so - called primary emotions			1
these are anger , fear , sadness , disgust , surprise , anticipation , trust and joy			1
in a video the robot is seen responding to particular words and phrases , including insults and compliments			0
‘ i hate you , ’ the robot is told at one point			0
‘ i ’m just trying to help you , ’ it responds			0
the company claims this is the first time that machines have been empowered with the ability to respond to human emotions			2
@entity19 ( shown ) can replicate emotions and can feel happy or sad			1
it can also recognise when a human is happy or sad via a camera			1
this can be either your phone or an external camera bought separately			1
the cube can play you music or video based on your requests in a video the robot is seen responding to particular words and phrases , including insults and compliments			1
‘ i hate you , ’ the robot is told at one point			0
‘ i ’m just trying to help you , ’ it responds			0
@entity144 's central eye looks eerily similar to @entity145 from the 1968 movie 2001 : a @entity147 speaking to @entity148 , @entity149 from @entity14 says they built the device in order to make machines more like us			1
' if we create a robot in the future , we want them to be more like us , ' he said			0
' we want machines to be more like humans , not humans to be more like machines			0
' he was not willing to say how the technology works exactly , as he says it is still patent pending			0
but while the machine can only monitor facial expressions for now , mr @entity149 says the company plans to also monitor emotions in a human 's voice as well eventually			2
@entity174 runs on @entity175 or @entity176 and connects to other devices via @entity178 or @entity179			0
the company plans to launch @entity19 by @entity181 this year			1
‘ how can any inanimate object interact with humans and learn how to please them without empathy ? ’ said @entity182 , ceo of @entity14			2
‘ the @entity35 advancement represents a step change for the future of technological goods such as smartphones , computers , toys , medicine , finance and robotics			0
’ speaking to @entity148 , @entity149 from @entity14 says they built the device in order to make machines more like us			2
' if we create a robot in the future , we want them to be more like us , ' he said			0
pictured are @entity205 and @entity206 from the @entity208 movies			0

@entity15 - based @entity14 has created a cube - shaped device with emotions
called @entity19 it can recognise and emulate the eight primary emotions
these are anger , fear , sadness , disgust , surprise , anticipation , trust and joy
the machine can replicate these emotions and can feel happy or sad
it can also recognise when a human is happy or sad via a camera
this can be either your phone or an external camera bought separately
the cube can play you music or video based on your request
and by knowing your emotional state it will pick different things
@entity247 costs £ 195 ( $ 315 ) and will be available by @entity181
