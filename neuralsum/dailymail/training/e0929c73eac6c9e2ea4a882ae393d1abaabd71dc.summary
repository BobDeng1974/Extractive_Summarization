the @entity7 mayor joined in a children 's match to promote a new health report aiming to get more kids involved in sport			1
but after seeing one youngster knock the ball past him mr @entity3 stuck his leg out , tripping him up , sparking shouts of ' referee ! ' from the side - lines			1
but he instead had to issue a public apology for his behaviour on the football field , set up outside @entity37 near @entity38 in @entity7			2
wearing his suit and moving slowly across the grass , he stuck his right foot in for the tackle and sent the youngster flying			0
he told @entity44 : ' that was a total mistake			0
i was going for the ball			0
' mr @entity3 has a history of reckless fouls on the football pitch after infamously leaving an opposition player sprawled on the floor after tacking him in a charity game – with his head			1
the @entity7 mayor – who was then the mp for @entity56 – was taking part in a charity @entity58 - versus - @entity60 match in front of 15,000 people at the @entity63 in @entity64 in 2006			1

' mr @entity3 's latest football indiscretion comes after he was forced to dismiss calls for a ban on smoking in public parks - after the mayor 's top health advisor called for the dramatic measure to be introduced			1
@entity22 said the capital should follow @entity120 's example by banning smoking in @entity122 , @entity123 and the @entity124 in a bid to reduce the 8,400 annual early deaths among @entity7 smokers			0
but mr @entity3 today said he has refused to act on the call for a ban - despite former @entity120 mayor @entity130 crediting the policy as having boosted life expectancy by nearly three years			1
claiming there was a lack of clinical evidence in the @entity136 to justify a ban , he said : ' there are many other proposals in this report that i think involve less bossiness , less nannying , less finger - wagging than telling people they ca n't smoke in a vast open space			1
' i think smoking is a scourge and people should be discouraged from smoking , but actively to ban people from doing something that is legal in a big open space is taking bossiness too far			0
' @entity3 , right , tackles @entity60 's @entity65 during a charity match at the @entity63 in @entity64 in 2006 the @entity58 versus @entity60 charity game was organised to raise money for the @entity156 @entity155 and the @entity157 @entity158 earlier told the @entity159 she would act if elected to @entity37 in 2016			1
' if you are asking somebody of @entity22 's eminence and reputation to conduct an investigation like this , you have got to have a pretty good reason for not accepting it if you want to improve the health of @entity168 , ' she said			2
' the recommendations are all grounded in evidence and have public support - 59 per cent are in favour of a ban			0
' @entity22 has looked at the very radical proposals that mayor @entity130 introduced in @entity120			0
these have been tried and tested			0
similar protections should be offered to @entity168			0
' if i were mayor of @entity7 , promoting the health of @entity168 would be one of the key areas i would want to act on			0
