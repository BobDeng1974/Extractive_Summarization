human - powered velomobiles are meant to be a quirky alternative to cars			0
but because these pedal - powered machines ca n't go as fast , these vehicles have up until now been relegated to the travelling on the side of the road now @entity8 - based inventor @entity7 has created an electric - assist ' @entity10 ' velomobile that he claims can travel at up to 100mph ( 160km/h )			2
' on a bicycle , your pedals are the accelerator			0
same with the @entity10 , only multiplied a hundred times			0
' the @entity10 's pedals are connected to a unique flywheel generator rather than of directly driving the wheels , as in a traditional velomobile			0
the @entity10 is a power biking vehicle that uses @entity16 - electric hybrid technology to amplify pedal power , enabling the rider 's legs to propel the vehicle up to highway speeds , giving the rider the feeling of super strength , ' mr @entity7 says the @entity10 's pedals are connected to a unique flywheel generator rather than of directly driving the wheels , as in a traditional velomobile the pedals power a 20 - @entity48 electric motor , which sits in the rear wheel hub			1

the pedals powers a 20 - @entity48 electric motor , which sits in the rear wheel hub			1
it senses the torque being applied to the pedals , and then amplifies it so that most people can maintain a cruising speed of around 30 mph ( 48 km / h )			2
during pedalling , a 2 - @entity48 li - ion battery pack also gets charged to help extend the 570lb ( 259kg ) velomobiles range			2
when activated in throttle mode , using just battery power , it has a range of approximately 50 miles ( 80 km ) and a top speed of 100 mph ( 160 km / h )			1

mr @entity7 has created a prototype and is currently running a @entity94 campaign to create a commercial mode			0
according to the @entity94 campaign : ' the system provides variable resistance , based on programmable or pre-set workout profiles , and @entity101 terrain - sensing virtual hills , all with torque amplified pedalling '			0
it is estimated the price of the @entity10 will start at $ 35,000 ( Â£ 22,800 ) if the campaign is successful			0
