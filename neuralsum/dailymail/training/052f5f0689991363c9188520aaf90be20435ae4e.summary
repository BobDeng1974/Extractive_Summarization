standing at 6ft 7in , @entity1 striker @entity0 often has to peer down at those who are in his company			1
but rarely would he ever have to look quite as far down as he did when he stopped for a picture with jockey @entity5 , who is 5ft			2
@entity0 , in @entity7 with the @entity1 squad who are enjoying a team break in the sunshine , went along to the @entity12 , where he bumped into the diminutive figure of @entity14			1
@entity0 ( left ) posed with jockey @entity5 ( right ) at @entity12 @entity0 later tweeted a picture of the image with the above caption and the duo posed for a picture together , appearing to laugh at the 1ft 7in difference in height between them			1
@entity14 , who is competing on friday , could have ended up being a team - mate of @entity0 's had things turned out differently for him when he was younger			0
he had trials with @entity26 and @entity27 , but his size meant they eventually turned him away			0
for two years , striker @entity0 played for @entity31 , the team that @entity14 supports ' i wanted to be a footballer , but with my size and height that was n't going to work out , ' @entity14 said in an interview with @entity37 in 2009			0
instead , @entity31 fan @entity14 would have been looking up to @entity0 in more ways than one when the forward played at @entity39 from 2009 - 11 , before moving to @entity1 .			0

@entity1 are on a warm *weather* break in @entity7 after tough *fixture* *schedule*
@entity0 met jockey @entity5 at @entity12
