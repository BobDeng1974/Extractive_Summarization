smokers who use e-cigarettes are likely to stop or reduce their smoking , claims an independent review of trial data			1
almost one in 10 smokers using e-cigarettes had been able to quit the habit up to a year later , and around one - third had cut down			1
the review of two trials is published today in the @entity11 , the world ’s leading producer of systematic reviews			2
controversy continues over whether e-cigarettes have net benefits , amid fears that using them in public places will ‘ re-normalise ’ smoking , especially among young people , and reverse declining smoking rates			1
the independent review of two trials has revealed almost one in 10 smokers using e-cigarettes had been able to quit the habit up to a year later , and around a third had cut down professor @entity29 of the @entity31 @entity30 at @entity32 , co-author of the review , said smokers wanting to quit who had failed using conventional aids such as patches should try buying e cigarettes			1
the trial data showed no serious adverse effects from short to medium term use , he said			1
‘ although our confidence in the effects of electronic cigarettes as smoking cessation interventions is limited because of the small number of trials , the results are encouraging ’ he said			1
around 2.1 million @entity31 use battery - powered e-cigarettes - devices allowing users to inhale nicotine while avoiding the harm caused by tobacco smoke			2
it is estimated that two thirds are current smokers , many of who are trying to quit , and most of the remainder are ex-smokers			2
the @entity31 ’s drug watchdog has decided they must be regulated as medicines to make the products ‘ safer and more effective ’ but this wo n’t happen until 2016			0
in @entity66 , health legislators are consulting on plans to make the principality the first part of the @entity31 to ban e-cigarettes in enclosed public places			0
some countries have banned them altogether including @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , along with @entity76			0
the @entity77 claimed in august that the devices pose a risk to bystanders through emissions of ‘ toxicant ’ substances and warned of limited evidence they help people quit smoking			1
the @entity88 looked at two trials involving 662 current smokers , and 11 observational studies			1
some experts fear e-cigs act as a gateway to smoking in younger people , who might not have started smoking otherwise ( file picture ) about nine per cent of smokers who used e-cigarettes were able to stop smoking at up to one year , compared with four per cent of those in the trial using nictotine - free e-cigarettes			1
the researchers found 36 per cent of e-cigarette users halved the number of conventional cigarettes they used , compared with 28 per cent getting the nicotine - free alternative			0
professor @entity110 said critics who claimed e-cigarettes might contain some toxins should realise they are not being compared with ‘ fresh air ’ but the known harms of conventional cigarettes			0
the furore over e-cigarettes and unexpected opposition from some quarters , including public health doctors , was possibly due to it being a ‘ disruptive technology ’ , he said			0
it threatens vested interests , from tobacco manufacturers to those with ‘ established public health positions ’ he added			0
professor @entity129 , editor - in - chief of @entity130 and director of tobacco research at @entity132 , said : ‘ this study tells us that even the older style electronic cigarettes improve smokers ’ chances of stopping by about 50 per cent			0
‘ it ’s early days but so far it seems that these devices are already helping tens of thousands of smokers to stop each year			1
’ dr @entity142 , vice president for policy at the @entity143 said : ‘ our position remains that while e-cigarettes may help smokers who want to quit , we do n’t yet have enough evidence yet of the impact they are having on other people , particularly children and smokers who also use e-cigarettes			2
‘ there ’s good evidence that most people start smoking in their teens and that the most effective way to stop smoking is through @entity159 quit smoking services			2
‘ it has taken decades of sustained effort to create a society in the @entity31 where smoking is now not seen as the norm			0
‘ our concern is that e-cigarettes could reverse this and create a new generation of customers for the tobacco industry , who might otherwise not have started smoking			0

review of two trials found one in 10 smokers using e-cigs quit a year later
controversy rages over whether devices are beneficial with some claiming they *'re* - normalise ' smoking , especially in young people
but @entity88 found no serious adverse effects from short to medium use when looking at two trials
