she said : ‘ i do n’t think it is right that a criminal matter should be used for entertainment			0

she said : ‘ i was advised in very general terms many months ago that a programme was being planned			2

and although i was told i would be kept up to date i have n’t had any further communication from @entity2			1
’ she added : ‘ @entity2 wrote to me to advise that they were making the programme and as i recall they asked whether i ’d like to participate			1

’ recreation : the drama - called @entity4 - will recreate the moment @entity14 is bludgeoned to death in the @entity27 home in @entity28 , @entity29			1
above , the programme is filmed in the capital last month @entity4 ’s disappearance and the lack of an actual criminal trial means the case has attracted a seemingly endless series of conspiracy theories			2

he was declared legally dead in october 1999			0

she is adamant her husband took his own life shortly after the crime and that she had long ago learned to forgive him			0
bloody : this shocking image from the new drama shows the body of @entity14 lying on the floor she said : ‘ i believe my late husband committed suicide shortly after the murder of @entity14 , most probably by bravely throwing himself on to the propellers of a ship in @entity201 , hoping that his remains would be irrecoverable so that death duties would not be immediately payable as the children ’s education had not been secured			1
' my husband committed suicide because he was an honourable man			0
’ she added : ‘ of course , i have learned to forgive him			0
’ when asked about the @entity213 public ’s continued obsession with the case , @entity64 replied : ‘ i did n’t realise people were fascinated with such a dull subject			0

shocking : in this still , @entity80 is depicted as a blood - soaked @entity23 the drama , which will be screened by @entity2 next month , begins with @entity221 carrying out interviews for the book and the episodes are believed to stick very closely to his theories about the crime and @entity4 ’s subsequent fate			1

sources have revealed that @entity4 ’s only son , @entity247 , has met the producers to seek assurances that he will not be portrayed as an adult , and that the show will steer clear of claims that @entity4 was reunited with his children on a family holiday to @entity167			0
a source close to the production said that the film would present @entity4 as the killer			0
the source said : ‘ there are some conspiracy theories out there that say that there was someone else in the house or someone wanted to kill @entity14 but the film wo n’t make any time for those			1
‘ the researchers have concluded that it ’s doubtful whether @entity4 even knew @entity14			1
’ the programme will claim that @entity4 had concocted a ‘ very complicated alibi ’ but his plans were dashed when @entity14 , rather than his wife , entered the room where he was hiding that fateful night			1
