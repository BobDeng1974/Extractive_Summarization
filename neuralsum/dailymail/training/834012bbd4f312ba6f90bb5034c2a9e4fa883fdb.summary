by @entity0 published : 18:12 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 07:08 est , 7 november 2012 under threat : a key ingredient used in @entity3 5 may be banned if found to cause allergies famously , it was the only thing @entity6 wore in bed , and it has been synonymous with style and sophistication for more than nine decades			1
but now , for the first time in its 91 - year history , @entity3 perfume is under threat			1
the reason ? one of its key ingredients — a naturally occurring type of tree moss — has come under the microscope of a team of @entity22 scientists who believe it may cause allergies			1
it may seem bizarre that the top - selling perfume in the world — a bottle is sold every 30 seconds — could potentially be so damaging when tens of thousands of women across the globe wear it every day			1
but it ’s just the latest in a long line of restrictions imposed on the scent industry in the past few years			2
under rules implemented by the @entity41 in 2006 , 26 common ingredients including the now - infamous tree moss and eugenol ( found in rose oil ) , must be declared on the packaging of perfume because they are potentially allergenic			1
now it has emerged that the @entity41 ’s @entity45 of @entity46 , charged with protecting citizens from harmful substances , has extended the list to cover 100 ‘ unsafe ’ materials			1
while they recommend that some must be declared on packaging or the amount used in a perfume be restricted , they want some — including the tree moss used in @entity3 to help give it its distinctive smell — banned entirely			1
and while these are only guidelines and not law , it is likely that perfume manufacturers will feel pressure to comply			2
the industry watchdog , the @entity65 , is taking it so seriously it has decided to conduct further research into the potential skin allergens on the back of the recommendations			0
for the new list calls for restrictions of many commonly used ingredients such as citral , found in lemon and tangerine oils , and coumarine , which comes from the spicy @entity93 tonka bean — all naturally sourced ingredients , it should be pointed out , which have been used for decades in perfume - making without causing serious harm			1
it is even feared that jasmine and rose — some of the most common ingredients in the world ’s favourite scents — could be put on future lists			1
what is this innocuous - sounding tree moss , and how important is it to @entity3 ? according to @entity109 , director of @entity111 - based international fragrance house @entity110 , tree moss has always been an important ingredient in high - end fragrances thanks to its distinctive earthy , woody scent , which no 5 fans would immediately recognise			1
' unsafe ' : the @entity41 's @entity45 of @entity46 wants to ban the tree moss ingredient ‘ it ’s created by scraping moss from the bark of @entity124 trees , often in former @entity126 countries , which is then steam - distilled , ’ he says			1
‘ but it has already started to be phased out of many perfumes and replaced with similar - scented synthetic mosses or oak moss , though only if it is low in atranol , the component of moss which is a known skin - sensitiser ’			1
oak moss , it must be mentioned , is also in @entity3 , and also on the future ‘ forbidden ’ list			1
but mr @entity109 argues that ingredients being banned or restricted is nothing new to the industry , and that perfumers are expert at phasing out problem materials while finding alternatives			2
that is clearly not how everyone feels , though			0
@entity3 spokeswoman @entity147 declared : ‘ it would be the end of beautiful perfumes if we could not use these ingredients ’ ; while the @entity148 said it would lead to ‘ the death of perfume if this continues ’			1
one wonders what @entity157 herself would have thought of being told by @entity22 scientists that her beloved fragrance had to be updated before it had even reached its 100th birthday			2
because the story leading to its creation is just as captivating as the scent itself			0
until @entity3 emerged in 1921 , perfumes had tended to be thick and rich with animal musk			1
having already taken the @entity169 fashion scene by storm , @entity157 decided to turn her hand to a beauty product that had so far eluded her , a fragrance that was light , fresh and reflected the liberated spirit of the new decade			0
her mother had been a laundry woman in rural @entity177 , so she loved the smell of soap , but for years she was unable to find a perfumer who was up to the task , because citrus fragrances such as lemon , bergamot and orange just did n’t last on the skin			0
then , in 1920 , she heard about a daring perfumer @entity189 , who had worked for the @entity192 royal family and lived in the capital of perfume , @entity195			0
he took up her challenge , spending months creating ten samples for her to try			0
they were numbered one to five and 20 to 24			0
and , you guessed it , she picked number five			0
testing : the @entity65 is now conducting further research into potential skin allergens she is said to have told @entity189 : ‘ i present my dress collections on the fifth of may , the fifth month of the year , and so we will let this sample number five keep the name it has already — it will bring good luck			2
the scent combined jasmine , rose , sandalwood and vanilla with other background notes , and it is said that when @entity3 sprayed the perfume around her table in an upmarket @entity169 restaurant , women passing by literally stopped in their tracks to ask her what the fragrance was and where it came from			1
she declared later : ‘ it was what i was waiting for			0
a perfume like nothing else			0
a woman ’s perfume , with the scent of a woman			2
’ @entity177 fashion designer @entity238 released @entity239 5 in 1921 @entity240 would show that millions of women from all walks of life agreed with her , from the @entity93 war - time wives who had it brought back from @entity247 by their gi sweethearts , to the one - in - ten modern women who were wearing @entity3 5 when they met ‘ the one ’ , according to a study in 2009			1
so will all these women really fail to notice if the formula is changed ? perfumer @entity253 is not so sure			0
while he admits that it has been necessary to remove certain common components of fragrances over the last century — both for health reasons , such as when benzene was phased out when it was discovered to be a potential carcinogen , and ethical ones , like the disappearance of musks taken from slaughtered animals — he says it is never easy to recreate a well - known scent with different raw materials			2
‘ it ’s impossible to reformulate without making a product smell different — that is why the original ingredients were used in the first place , ’ he says			2
@entity253 , as a leading figure within the @entity111 perfume industry , is more than a little troubled by the ‘ @entity276 ’ restrictions that are gradually taking hold			0
‘ while i do think the consumer ’s health and wellbeing should always be our first priority , imagine if @entity282 authorised for all nut products to be banned or restricted because a few people are allergic , ’ he says			2
‘ there ’s huge inconsistency			2
i have to list it on the back of packaging if i use more than a certain percentage because it ’s one of the original list of 26 the @entity41 decided must be declared			1
‘ but a chef can take a huge bunch of basil , chop it up and sprinkle it over food , and their hands will be covered with basil oil			0
there are no guidelines there			0
’ he does make a valid point			0
many of the ingredients that are now being considered dangerous are even @entity307 what does @entity253 suggest for the future ? ‘ as an industry , we are very responsible			0
we would never want to use ingredients that were scientifically proven to be a major problem , but i do believe consumers should have freedom of choice			0
‘ there are scents around that people have loved for centuries , so is it right to do away with them entirely ? i ’ll leave you to draw your own conclusions			0

a bottle of @entity3 is sold every 30 seconds around the world
scientists are testing whether a key ingredient - a naturally occurring type of tree moss - causes allergies
@entity41 ’s @entity45 of @entity46 wants the material banned
@entity336 could also affect miss @entity79 , @entity81 ’s @entity80 and @entity82 by @entity83
