you begin to believe @entity1 after a night like this			1
@entity4 ’s first win since december 7 came in the 94th minute through their first penalty award of the season			1
it was late , it was a little lucky , but it was deserved			0
a roar rose out of @entity9 louder than any heard in a long while			0
@entity1 , hugged and lifted by goalkeeping coach @entity11 , looked like he was emitting the most decibels			1
in the instant @entity13 rolled the ball beyond @entity16 from 12 yards the mood in this stadium lifted			1
@entity13 sends the goalkeeper the wrong way to score a dramatic late penalty and seal the win for @entity4 @entity13 celebrates his goal with @entity4 team - mates @entity24 and @entity26 @entity4 manager @entity1 celebrates the winning goal that gave him his first win in charge at the club @entity31 threads the ball through @entity16 's legs to open the scoring for @entity4 in the first half @entity31 salutes the crowd in celebration after opening the scoring at @entity9 @entity38 looks on in horror as @entity40 nods home from close range after a knock - down from @entity44 @entity46 's top scorer for the season @entity40 wheels away in celebration after equalising for the visitors @entity51 was lucky not to be sent off after this dangerous high tackle on @entity40 - both players were booked for the melee @entity4 ( 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity38 6 ; @entity51 6.5 , @entity54 7 , @entity55 6.5 , @entity56 6 ; @entity57 6.5 ( @entity58 77 ) , @entity59 6.5 , @entity60 7.5 ; @entity61 7 ( @entity62 59 6 ) ; @entity13 7.5 , @entity31 8 ( @entity26 82 )			1
subs not used : given , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66			0
goals : @entity31 , @entity13			1

seven consecutive defeats punctuated by one mighty win			0
how momentous it proves remains to be seen , the battle will present many turns , but this felt seismic			0
@entity1 owes a large dose of gratitude to @entity16 , mind you			1
in the third minute of added time the @entity46 goalkeeper launched into a calamitous dive after fumbling a bouncing ball , bringing down @entity56 in the process			1
referee @entity106 pointed to the penalty spot			2
@entity13 was the calmest man in the ground , placing the ball the other side of @entity16			1
no longer do @entity4 hold the unwanted tag of only side in @entity113 ’s top four divisions without a league win in 2015			1
it was earned based on a display of vigour , purpose and creativity			0
@entity31 , scorer of @entity4 ’s first , played his best game in recent memory			1
@entity46 boss @entity123 conceded @entity16 had a ‘ poor night ’ but refused to blame his no 1			2
@entity16 looked shaky throughout and played a part earlier in the decisive goal by only palming @entity60 ’s shot from long range			2
he saved @entity130 ’s rebound but @entity51 collected the ball and delivered the cross that ultimately led to the penalty award			2
@entity51 ’s involvement at this stage was moot			0
he should have been dismissed earlier for a nasty lunge on @entity40 , who received studs into his midriff			2
@entity44 appeared to offer @entity51 down the tunnel in a ruckus			2
@entity85 booked @entity40 and @entity51 , meaning retrospective action from the @entity142 on the @entity144 right - back is unlikely			1
before @entity13 struck , it had seemed @entity40 ’s equaliser would crush @entity4			1
in the 66th minute the @entity46 striker applied a simple header from two yards out after @entity44 had headed back @entity70 ’s corner			1
his 12th @entity151 goal of the season is only three behind @entity4 ’s total — an example of their struggles as much as his fine form			1
@entity16 capped a terrible performance by bringing down @entity56 in the third minute of added time for a penalty @entity40 celebrates while being chased by his team - mates , it was his 18th goal of the season in all competitions @entity4 manager @entity1 ran down the touchline and celebrated vigorously after @entity31 's goal @entity31 beat @entity16 again shortly after but @entity44 raced back to clear the ball off the line @entity16 saves himself from a howler during the first half after the ball slipped out of his hands and almost ended up in his own net @entity16 initially caught the shot from @entity31 but it then slipped through his legs and he had to react quickly @entity31 reacts after @entity46 keeper @entity16 almost dropped the ball over his own goal line in the first half @entity1 , who had seen his team lose to an injury time penalty to @entity177 in his first home match in charge , was in no mood to downplay his first win as @entity4 manager			1

the boys in the dressing room want to give them a lot of confidence			0
’ at the end he checked his pulse by pressing fingers to neck			0
‘ i was just checking i was still alive , ’ he laughed			0
‘ but we ’re alive and kicking			0
’ coming against the club that elected to employ @entity123 rather than him in their own relegation fight must have offer pleasure			0
@entity16 almost gifted @entity4 the lead in the 14th minute			2
he can thank goalline technology that parity was maintained			0
@entity60 sent over a cross that was headed back into danger by @entity13			2
@entity31 spun and hit a tame shot that @entity16 looked like he had collected until the ball squirmed through his legs and apparently over the line before the keeper reclaimed it			1
replays showed there was an inch in it			0
in the 23rd minute the home roar was released			0
@entity38 fired a clearance high and long , @entity13 leapt to win the flick - on and release @entity31 , whose pace left @entity44 in the dust			1
the @entity4 striker raced into the box and delivered a finish through the legs of @entity16 , ahead of @entity69 ’s dive			2
as @entity9 erupted , @entity31 ran in front of the @entity46 supporters cupping his ear			1
@entity1 jigged down the touchline towards the @entity9 , his hands gripped in fists of delight			2
it was a similar scene at the final whistle and later a disappointed @entity16 tweeted his apologies			0
‘ i love you all , ’ he said			0
unfortunately for him , those feeling will be reciprocated by @entity4 and their fans			2
late in the second half , @entity16 is beaten by a shot from @entity60 but his shot hits the woodwork one team 's star striker chases another as @entity40 looks to evade @entity255 international @entity13 at @entity9 @entity46 midfielder @entity72 tackles @entity4 goal scorer @entity31 during the @entity151 clash @entity4 captain @entity60 tackles @entity46 midfielder @entity71 during the first half @entity46 's record signing @entity259 contests an aerial duel with @entity4 defender @entity55 @entity46 midfielder @entity74 and former @entity262 full back @entity51 collapse in a heap after colliding @entity13 strides through the @entity46 half while being tracked by @entity46 midfielders @entity72 and @entity73 @entity4 manager @entity1 signs autographs for young supporters before kick - off on tuesday evening			1
