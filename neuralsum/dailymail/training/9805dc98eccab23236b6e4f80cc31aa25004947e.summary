@entity8 , a former chairman of @entity1 ’s ruling @entity9 , quit in order to campaign for @entity12 ’s party			1
her departure is a major embarrassment for @entity1 , which has started a belated fightback against @entity2 in recent months			1
she is the most senior @entity1 figure to publicly back @entity2			1
in a further sign of @entity1 tensions on the issue , the party ’s biggest donor warned that mr @entity5 ’s refusal to hold a referendum on @entity7 will ‘ inevitably weaken ’ @entity38 ’s chances of getting a better deal from @entity40			1
@entity41 , who gave the party £ 1.65million in 2013 , said ‘ many in the @entity1 ’ want mr @entity5 to abandon opposition to an in / out vote			1
mrs @entity8 could not be contacted for comment last night			1
but in a message on @entity49 , her daughter @entity47 – a former @entity2 candidate – said : ‘ pleased that mummsy @entity50 will be supporting @entity2 in the 2015 election			0
’ @entity2 also confirmed the defection			0
@entity12 said : ‘ i ’m delighted that @entity2 can now count upon the support of such a respected figure as @entity8			1
‘ a life - long trade unionist and @entity1 member who served as chairman of @entity5 ’s @entity9 , she is yet another voice calling for @entity38 to have a choice about its future			1
we are welcoming support from across the board and @entity8 ’s support is evidence of this			2
’ game over : @entity5 at the centre in @entity20 yesterday , left , and @entity8 , right , who defected to @entity2 in a speech on the economy on monday , mr @entity5 appeared to rule out holding a referendum on @entity7			1
‘ the real threat to prosperity after the general election would be to leave the @entity76 , ’ he said			0
‘ under a @entity1 government , @entity38 will be a strong and proud member of a reformed @entity76			2
’ mr @entity41 , a long - time supporter of a referendum , will today be among the keynote speakers at a conference in @entity82 examining options for @entity38 outside the @entity76			0
last night he said mr @entity5 ’s hopes of reforming the @entity76 would be seriously compromised by his opposition to a referendum			1
‘ if @entity5 becomes prime minister in may and renegotiates without committing to a referendum , he will inevitably weaken the @entity38 ’s bargaining position , ’ he said			1
‘ minds in @entity40 are much more likely to take renegotiation seriously if they know that there is a substantial risk that the @entity38 will leave the @entity76 if there is not a satisfactory deal on the table to persuade the @entity38 to stay in			0
’ former @entity98 cabinet minister @entity97 , who is also speaking at the conference organised by the @entity101 mep @entity100 , will also make the most explicit call yet for @entity38 to leave the @entity76			0
he said last night @entity38 could become ‘ really active , major players ’			0
‘ i see a huge optimistic vision for this country , a really spectacular future , but to do it and to get there , we have to leave , ’ he added			0
labour sources claimed mrs @entity8 had lost her role in @entity27 for non-attendance at meetings			2
a spokesman said : ‘ the vast majority of the @entity1 are united behind our position on @entity7 , believing @entity38 ’s best interests are served by staying in a reformed @entity76 and not sleepwalking towards an exit which would cost jobs and influence			1
’ one of @entity38 ’s leading businessmen has accused @entity5 of being a ‘ card carrying @entity122 ’ who is unfit to govern			2
in the latest salvo from a captain of industry , sir @entity124 also accused the @entity1 leader of ‘ learning nothing and forgetting everything ’ from the financial crisis			2
sir @entity41 , who bought @entity132 for £ 1million in 1970 and transformed it into one of the @entity38 ’s biggest property investment companies , voiced concerns that a @entity1 government would ‘ pick up some of the flaws of the @entity138 economy ’			2
he said : ‘ i would simply say there is a problem when the leadership is obviously very inexperienced , has never been involved in commerce and whose family tradition is one of left wing , totally unreconstructed , card carrying @entity148			0
this is not a good basis for pragmatic government			0
’ the 79 - year - old @entity152 grandee , who was responsible for transforming the skyline of @entity82 with the development of the giant @entity156 office complex , added : ‘ this all adds to the impression that mr @entity5 is unfit to govern			2
’ last night one of @entity38 ’s leading fashion entrepreneurs also joined the backlash against @entity1			0
arguing mr @entity5 warrants his ‘ @entity5 ’ nickname , @entity163 – who previously owned @entity38 fashion chain @entity165 – said : ‘ i am only just realising how socialist @entity5 is			0
i am shocked at this , but @entity1 sound as if they want to stamp on aspiration			0
