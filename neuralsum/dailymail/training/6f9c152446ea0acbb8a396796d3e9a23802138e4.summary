by @entity0 published : 14:42 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 13:43 est , 7 june 2013 a popular jeep off - roader favoured by thousands of @entity4 school - run families is at the centre of a major fire safety row after @entity8 officials blamed it for more than 50 deaths			1
car bosses have refused @entity8 government demands to recall nearly three million of the @entity13 over ' deadly problems '			1
defiant @entity15 is refusing to recall about 2.7 million of the @entity16 which safety officials says are at risk of a fuel tank fire in a rear - end collision			1
the siting of the @entity13 fuel tank is a ' defect ' which poses an ' unreasonable risk to safety , ' say safety chiefs – a charge which @entity15 rejects			1
some 23,511 of the @entity28 made between 1993 and 2004 are still on the road in the @entity4 the @entity30 has now sent @entity15 a letter asking that the company voluntarily recall @entity28 - which were also sold in @entity4 – between 1993 and 2004			1
some 23,511 of the @entity28 from this period are still on the road in the @entity4 , according to the @entity35 and traders			0
the recall request also affects the @entity38 built between 2002 and 2007 , which was not sold in the @entity4			2
@entity30 found at least 32 rear - impact crashes and fires in @entity41 that caused 44 deaths			1
it also found at least five rear crashes in @entity44 , causing seven deaths			2
the fire row between @entity15 , its parent company @entity48 , and government safety chiefs was the lead item on prime time news broadcasts in the @entity8 , including @entity52			2
@entity15 , which is now majority - owned by @entity53 's @entity48 insisted in a statement on tuesday that the @entity16 are safe and it ' does not intend to recall the vehicles '			1
such a refusal by a car company is rare			2
and though the @entity30 can order a recall but needs a court order to enforce it			2
@entity60 , the safety agency 's administrator , said in a statement that he hopes @entity15 will reconsider its decision			0
will it be recalled ? the 1998 @entity65 @entity15 , which is now majority - owned by @entity53 's @entity48 insisted in a statement on tuesday that the @entity16 are safe ' our data shows that these vehicles may contain a defect that presents an unreasonable risk to safety , ' he said			1
@entity8 car safety chiefs opened an investigation into the @entity16 in august 2010 at the request of the @entity77 in @entity78			2
they found that the @entity16 ' fuel tanks can fail when hit from the rear , leak fuel and cause fires if there 's an ignition source			1
the positioning of the tanks behind the rear axle and their height above the road is a design defect , it said in a letter to @entity15 dated monday			2
@entity15 moved the fuel tanks on the @entity95 ahead of the rear axle in 2005 , and did the same thing with the @entity38 in 2007			1
@entity30 said the older jeeps performed poorly when compared with all but one similar vehicle from the 1993 to 2007 model years : ' particularly in terms of fatalities , fires without fatalities , and fuel leaks in rear - end impacts and crashes			1
' the agency calculated that the older @entity28 and @entity108 have fatal crash rates that are about double those of similar vehicles			0
it asks @entity15 to recall the vehicles and ' implement a remedy action that improves their performance in rear - impacts and crashes '			1
car - makers usually agree to a recall request , partly to avoid bad publicity			1
in the last three years , @entity15 has conducted 52 recalls			0
but @entity15 insists its review of nearly 30 years of data shows a low number of rear - impact crashes involving fire or a fuel leak in the affected jeeps and that the the recall request is based on an ' incomplete analysis of the underlying data '			1
@entity15 chairman and chief executive @entity131 insisted : ' the company stands behind the quality of its vehicles			0
' all of us remain committed to continue working with @entity30 to provide information confirming the safety of these vehicles			0
' the row comes as @entity15 prepares to launch the latest new generation of its @entity95 which is unaffected by the safety scare			0
' @entity30 seems to be holding @entity15 to a new standard for fuel tank integrity that does not exist now and did not exist when the @entity16 vehicles were manufactured , ' the company said			1
the dispute leaves owners of the affected @entity41 and @entity149 waiting for government or court action			0
it also leaves @entity15 open to the risk of big liability if there are more crashes and injuries linked to the fuel tanks , said @entity159 , a @entity160 law professor and former @entity15 corporate counsel			2
lawyers could argue that if @entity15 had recalled the @entity16 , people would n't have been hurt , he said			0
but that liability would be limited if @entity15 beats @entity30 in court and a judge rules the company did n't sell defective vehicles , said @entity159			0
@entity15 called the older @entity28 and @entity149 ' among the safest vehicles of their era ' saying they met all federal safety standards in effect when they were built			0
@entity30 's letter concedes this but adds : ' the existence of a minimum standard does not require @entity30 to ignore deadly problems			0
' @entity15 has until june 18 to respond to the safety administration 's letter			0
@entity30 has the authority to fine companies if slow to provide data or recall vehicles			0
the agency fined @entity185 a record $ 66million for failing to quickly report problems and for delaying a recall			0
@entity185 paid the fine without admitting it violated the law .			0
