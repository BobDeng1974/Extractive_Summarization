by @entity0 published : 04:17 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 04:17 est , 6 february 2013 president @entity1 will push for an ' urgent ' resumption of peacemaking talks between @entity4 and @entity5 when he visits the @entity6 in the spring			1
the @entity7 confirmed yesterday that the president will visit @entity4 , the @entity9 and @entity10 to discuss a wide range of issues in the region with @entity14 and @entity15 the most pressing			1
and the @entity17 ambassador to @entity4 says he will seek an ' urgent ' peacemaking agenda in @entity4 after efforts during @entity1 's first term fell apart			0
new agenda : president @entity1 will push for a new peacemaking deal between @entity4 and @entity5 when he visits the @entity6 in the spring speaking to the @entity4 media today , @entity24 said : ' we have a very complex agenda about @entity15 , @entity14 and the need to get @entity4 and the @entity29 back to the negotiating table , so it 's important to begin as fast as possible			2
' @entity1 's trip , his first to @entity4 since taking office , signalled that he intends to make the volatile @entity6 - where @entity15 remains locked in a nuclear standoff with the @entity9 and @entity14 is caught up in a bloody civil war - a top priority in his second term			0
while the @entity7 gave no exact dates for the trip , @entity4 's @entity40 television station cited unnamed sources in @entity44 saying @entity1 would start his visit to the jewish state on march 20			0
the choice of @entity4 , a close @entity17 ally , for @entity1 's first foreign travel since his january 21 inauguration will give the president and @entity4 prime minister @entity52 a chance to try to repair their notoriously fractious relationship			1
negotiation : the relationship between @entity1 and @entity52 have been frosty but the president 's second term gives them a chance to start afresh their dealings have been especially testy over the past year because of differences over how to best confront @entity15 's nuclear ambitions			1
@entity52 is now occupied with forging a new governing coalition after center - left challengers made surprising gains in last month 's elections , something that @entity1 's aides believe could strengthen his hand with the hawkish prime minister			0
but with @entity4 and the @entity29 deeply at odds over how to resume negotiations that broke down more than two years ago , any new @entity17 peace effort would face major obstacles			0
@entity1 and @entity52 discussed the president 's coming trip in a january 28 telephone call , the @entity7 and the @entity4 prime minister 's office said			1
' the start of the president 's second term and the formation of a new @entity4 government offer the opportunity to reaffirm the deep and enduring bonds between the @entity17 and @entity4 and to discuss the way forward on a broad range of issues of mutual concern , including @entity15 and @entity14 , ' the @entity7 said			2
@entity52 's office said only that the leaders had discussed a visit timed for after a new @entity4 coalition takes shape .			0
