he faces 25 years to life in prison an elementary school teacher who molested 13 students over a five - year period faces 25 years to life in prison			1
@entity9 pleaded no contest to the charges yesterday just as his preliminary hearing was about to begin in @entity13 in @entity14			1
the 51 - year - old admitted 13 counts of lewd acts upon a child			1
some of his victims were in court preparing to testify against their former teacher			2

prosecutors added nine more children to the case in may			0
the molestations occurred between september 2006 and april 2011 and involved children between the ages of eight and nine			0
although @entity1 was charged with molesting four children last year , @entity36 school officials waited until february to tell parents of his third - grade students about his arrest			0

according to court documents seen by the @entity49 @entity14 , the district ignored repeated complaints about @entity52 's conduct around children			1

that case went to trial but @entity52 was n't convicted due to a lack of physical evidence - it was his word against the child 's			2
but @entity36 said it has no record of this incident , and claims that because he was not convicted the district does not automatically investigate matters that take place off school grounds			0
the day after he was arrested in 1997 , @entity1 was suspended without pay from @entity79 in @entity80 , where he had worked for ten years			2
the charges were dismissed in august 1998 and @entity52 was reemployed , with back pay , at @entity27			0
