by @entity0 published : 11:35 est , 17 march 2014 updated : 16:19 est , 17 march 2014 federal prosecutors asked a judge monday to bar @entity6 bombing suspect @entity4 from seeing some of the gruesome autopsy photos of the three people killed in the attack			1
in a court filing , prosecutors said @entity4 should only be allowed to look at autopsy photos that will be used during his trial and sentencing			1
they said he should not be allowed to see the many other photos that will not be used against him in court			0
' allowing photos of the mutilated bodies of the victims to be viewed by the man accused of mutilating them would needlessly revictimize the family members in the same way that innocent children who are photographed pornographically are revictimized whenever those photos are seen by others , ' prosecutors wrote			1
violating victims ' rights : @entity4 ( left ) is accused of the @entity32 bombings , which killed third - grader @entity33 ( right ) and injured his mother and sister @entity36 , one of @entity4 's lawyers , declined to comment on the request			2
in their motion , prosecutors say they told the defense that if @entity4 were allowed to view all the photographs , the government would continue to make them available for lawyers ' review but would not provide copies			1
they said @entity4 's lawyers ' refused to accept any limitation on @entity4 's ability to view the autopsy photos and repeated their demand for copies of all of them			2
' @entity4 , 19 , has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges , including the use of a weapon of mass destruction			2
more than half the charges carry a possible death sentence			0
prosecutors allege that he and his brother , @entity61 , built two pressure cooker bombs and placed them near the finish line of last year 's marathon			0
@entity66 explosions killed two women and an eight - year - old boy and injured more than 260			0
victims : also killed were @entity70 , a 23 - year - old @entity72 student from @entity73 , and @entity74 , a 29 - year - old from @entity76 @entity61 died following a shootout with police several days after the april 15 marathon			0
@entity4 is being held in a federal prison as he awaits a trial scheduled to begin in november			1
in their motion , prosecutors ask to limit @entity4 's access to autopsy photos of the three bombing victims and @entity88 police officer @entity87 , who prosecutors allege was killed by the @entity4 brothers on april 18 as they fled			1
@entity93 professor @entity92 said he believes it will be difficult to persuade a judge to restrict @entity4 's access to the autopsy photos , especially because he could be sentenced to death			1
' the problem here is if there 's any possibility that there 's something in those photos that could be helpful or potentially helpful to him in a trial or in sentencing , he has to be allowed access to them , ' @entity92 said			0
' what they are really trying to do is make a strong statement on behalf of the victims ' families , and they have a right to do that			0
i just do n't think that right can trump the constitutional rights of the defendant			0

federal prosecutors do n't want @entity4 to see any photos of his victims bar the one that will be used during his trial
they say @entity4 viewing their mutilated bodies would ' violate victims ' right to *dignity* '
prosecutors do n't want to restrict @entity4 from seeing any photographs
