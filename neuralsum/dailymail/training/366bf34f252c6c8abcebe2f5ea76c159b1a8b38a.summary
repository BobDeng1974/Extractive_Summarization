militants in @entity2 have seized nuclear materials used for scientific research at a university , the @entity0 has been warned			1
@entity2 warned of the seizure in a letter on wednesday to the @entity0 in which it appealed for help to ' stave off the threat of their use by terrorists in @entity2 or abroad			1
' in the letter , which has been obtained by @entity14 , @entity2 's @entity0 ambassador @entity13 said nearly 40kg of uranium compounds were kept at @entity16			1
the city of @entity18 , @entity2 's second largest city , was captured last month in a seizure led by the @entity20 ( @entity20 )			1
militants in @entity2 have seized nuclear materials used for scientific research at a university in @entity18			1
pictured is an @entity20 supporter waving a flag in @entity26 , @entity27 , last month the @entity0 atomic agency has today said it believed the nuclear material was ' low grade ' and did not pose a significant security risk			1
' terrorist groups have seized control of nuclear material at the sites that came out of the control of the state , ' @entity13 told @entity38 ban ki - moon , adding that such materials ' can be used in manufacturing weapons of mass destruction			1
' ' these nuclear materials , despite the limited amounts mentioned , can enable terrorist groups , with the availability of the required expertise , to use it separate or in combination with other materials in its terrorist acts , ' said @entity13			2
he warned that they could also be smuggled out of @entity2			1
the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) ' is aware of the notification from @entity2 and is in contact to seek further details ' , @entity52 spokeswoman @entity51 said			2
@entity20 took over swathes of @entity27 and @entity2 before renaming itself the @entity57 on june 29 and declaring its leader caliph - a title held by successors of the @entity61			2
' on the basis of the initial information we believe the material involved is low grade and would not present a significant safety , security or nuclear proliferation risk , ' she said			1
' nevertheless , any loss of regulatory control over nuclear and other radioactive materials is a cause for concern			0
' a @entity78 government source said the materials were not believed to be enriched uranium and therefore would be difficult to use to manufacture into a nuclear weapon			2
earlier this week , video footage was published of @entity20 militants taking sledgehammers to centuries - old graves in @entity18			0
@entity86 , a former @entity52 chief inspector , said that if the material came from a university it could be laboratory chemicals or radiation shielding , consisting of natural or depleted uranium			2
' you can not make a nuclear explosive from this amount , but all uranium compounds are poisonous , ' @entity86 told @entity14			1
' this material is also not " good " enough for a dirty bomb			0
' in a so - called ' dirty bomb ' , conventional explosives are used to disperse radiation from any radioactive source , such as from hospitals and factories which are less well protected			0
' these nuclear materials , despite the limited amounts mentioned , can enable terrorist groups , with the availability of the required expertise , to use it separate or in combination with other materials in its terrorist acts ' - @entity2 's @entity0 ambassador @entity13 citing @entity0 investigations dating back ten years or more , @entity86 said there should be no enriched uranium in @entity18			1
the @entity117 - based @entity52 helped dismantle @entity2 's clandestine nuclear programme in the 1990s - during @entity86 's three decades there			1
any loss or theft of highly enriched uranium , plutonium or other types of radioactive material is potentially serious as militants could try to use them to make a crude nuclear device or a ' dirty bomb ' , experts say			2
because radioactive material is less hard to find and the device easier to make , experts say a ' dirty bomb ' - which could cause panic and have serious economic and environmental consequences - is a more likely threat than an actual atom bomb			2
earlier this week , video footage was published of @entity20 militants taking sledgehammers to centuries - old graves in @entity18			0
meanwhile , @entity143 's prime minister @entity142 has called on the @entity57 to release 49 people seized from the @entity143 consulate in @entity18 , before the end of the @entity148 holy month of @entity149			0
