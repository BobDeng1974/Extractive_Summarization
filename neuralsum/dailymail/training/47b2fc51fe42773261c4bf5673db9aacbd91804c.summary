by @entity0 published : 17:33 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 06:53 est , 23 january 2013 it 's already been dubbed ‘ space grave robbery ’ , but it ’s not quite as sinister as the name suggests			1
defunct communication satellites are being scavenged for their valuable parts and recycled to reduce the cost of building new ones in the latest pet project from the @entity11 's research wing			1
when satellites retire , certain parts such as antennas and solar panels often still work - but there is currently no routine effort to salvage and reuse satellite parts once they are launched into space			1
old to new : this defence @entity21 graphic shows a satellite used for its programme scavenging defunct communication satellites for their valuable parts and recycling them to build new ones the @entity21 is spending £ 114million ( $ 180million ) to test technologies that could make this possible and thinks it can save money by repurposing in orbit			1
‘ we 're attempting to essentially increase the return on investment ( and ) try to find a way to really change the economics so that we can lower the cost ’ of military space missions , a spokesman said			1
work on @entity21 's @entity40 programme - named after the mythical bird that rose from its own ashes - has begun			1
the agency awarded contracts to several companies to develop new technologies			0
now it is seeking fresh proposals from interested parties next month			0
a key test will come in 2016 when it launches a demonstration mission that seeks to breathe new life to an antenna			0
@entity21 wants the antenna to come from a yet - to - be - determined decommissioned satellite and the agency has identified about 140 retired satellites that it can choose from for its first test			1
new idea : the @entity21 ( based in @entity57 , @entity58 , pictured ) is testing technologies that could make this possible and thinks it can save money by repurposing in orbit the vision is to launch a robotic mechanic fitted out with a toolkit that can rendezvous with defunct satellites and mine them for parts			2
the plan also calls for the separate launch of mini-satellites			0
@entity21 is used to funding blue - sky research and a few projects are slowly becoming reality			2
in 2011 , it dangled seed money to jump - start a way to rocket people to a star within a century in what 's known as the 100 - year @entity80 programme			0
long before @entity81 tested self - driving cars , @entity21 sponsored a robotic road race in which university - designed autonomous vehicles eyed for the finish line without human help			2
the robotic mechanic would then string together the mini-satellites and old satellite parts to create a new communication system			1
the concept is essentially to perform robotic surgery in zero gravity			0
@entity21 said one way to keep costs down is for the mini-satellites to take a ride in available space on commercial rockets			2
@entity101 astrophysicist @entity100 , who tracks the world 's space launches and satellites , called it ‘ an interesting idea ’ that may reduce costs in the long - term			2
‘ the first few times you do this , it 'll definitely be more expensive than just building the new antenna on your satellite from scratch , ’ he said			0
‘ but in the long run , it might work out			0
’ dr @entity100 said the biggest challenge in the upcoming demo test is separating the antenna from the retired satellite without breaking it and then successfully integrating it with the mini-satellites .			0
