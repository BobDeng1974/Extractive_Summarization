by @entity1 reporter published : 10:32 est , 14 february 2014 @entity3 : 11:21 est , 14 february 2014 with their shocking gangland violence and drive - by shootings , the @entity5 computer games have earned their reputation as gritty recreations of the dark underbelly of @entity12 city life			2
they are a million miles from the bucolic charms of @entity15 â € “ but now a hilarious video imagines how the bestselling series might play out in @entity18 € ™ s south - west			0
the spoof , called ' @entity15 ' , shows one of the @entity23 's anti-hero protagonists on a mission to hunt down pasties			2
@entity15 : the spoof video combines clips from the game itself with a voiceover from comedian @entity31 , 35 , the man behind a string of @entity34 - themed viral videos , to hilarious effect he wanders through the familiar environment of the best - selling game , but instead of spraying bullets and stealing cars he talks to strangers in a @entity43 accent and moans about parking			1
he 's seen walking into a shop and asks for a steak pasty and a can of @entity48 - before hurriedly leaving when the proprietor tries to sell him a gun			0
but violence is n't far away , with him battering to the ground one adversary for daring to insult the good name of @entity56 - based retailer @entity55 and another for preferring another pasty maker over @entity59 's @entity58			0
realising that he might find himself in trouble with the police , he decides to leave the county and go on the run , perhaps to @entity64			0
but at the last minute he has second thoughts and the video ends with the hero leaping off a bridge rather than leaving @entity15 , yelling ' i ca n't live up country ! '			0
it shows one of the protagonists wandering through the familiar environment of the game , but instead of spraying bullets and stealing cars he talks to strangers in a @entity43 accent and moans about parking ' no need to get feisty ' : but violence is n't far away , with him battering to the ground one adversary for preferring another pasty maker over @entity59 's @entity58 the four - minute spoof combines clips from the game itself with a voiceover from comedian @entity31 , 35 , the man behind a string of @entity34 - themed viral videos			1
his latest effort - subtitled ' if @entity5 was set in our beloved county ' - has already been viewed more than 92,000 times on @entity96 ( warning : explicit language )			1
mr @entity31 's video comes on the heels of warnings that children as young as six have been copying rape scenes and swear words from the smash hit @entity107 title			1
how @entity15 really looks : the small village of @entity110 passage on the @entity111 near @entity112 mr @entity31 , a writer and comedy club boss , from @entity114 , @entity15 , said : ' a mate lent me a copy of the game and i just found it overly violent			1
' i started amusing myself with comedy accents and having a little fun with it and the video just evolved from there			0
' i 'm satirising the violence in a way because the game is so ridiculous you may as well make it look even more ridiculous by introducing a pasty shop			2

satire combines scenes from the game with a @entity43 voiceover
it is the the latest @entity96 spoof by @entity34 comedian @entity31 , 35
