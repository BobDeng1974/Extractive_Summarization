consumers may be clamouring for a super-slim @entity1 2 , but there are more revolutionary tablets on the horizon			0
@entity5 hopes to lead the way by incorporating a 3d scanner into a tablet set to be released next year			1
the technology would allow users to scan an object and manipulate an image on their screen using hand gestures before printing it out using a 3d printer			1
@entity5 plans on incorporating a 3d scanner into a tablet set to be released next year ( a concept is pictured )			1
it would allow users to scan an object and manipulate the @entity21 on their screen using hand gestures , before possible deciding to print it out using a 3d printer @entity5 ’s @entity25 technology , which allows devices to gauge depth like the human eye , will also be included in smartphones in the next couple of years , according to the chip maker , which is based in @entity32 , @entity33			1
users will scan an object from 360 degrees using a specially - adapted camera , which the firm says will fit into the slimmest of tablets			0
the scanner will comprise a standard webcam plus an infrared sensor to collect the depth information			0
it will ‘ see ’ an object in a way that it can work out how it is put together in @entity21 so that it can be accurately recreated on screen			2
tablets , as well as laptops and smartphones , will use advanced depth cameras as eyes and duel array microphones as ears , while people will use more precise hand and finger gestures to navigate screens @entity5 's technology would allow users to scan an object and manipulate the 3d image on their screen using hand gestures , before possibly deciding to print it out using a 3d printer			1

the camera will ‘ see ’ an object in a way that it can work out how it is put together in @entity21 so that it can be accurately recreated on screen			2
users will scan a desired object from 360 degrees using a specially - adapted camera			0
they will then be able to manipulate the image on screen , using hand gestures			1
when working together , @entity5 's @entity25 technology will let the tablet gauge depth like the human eye and will feature in tablets and smartphones			2
the idea is that a user could then manipulate the scanned object			0
so , if they scanned a teapot and wanted to make its spout longer , they could , and then print out the improved design using a 3d printer			0
3d object tracking will also be used to bring books to life , allowing people to interact with characters and make playing games on tablets more immersive and precise to control			1
@entity5 says : ‘ with @entity25 technology , you can scan , modify , print , and share in @entity21 , giving you a creative platform like you 've never seen			1
‘ what 's more , you 'll be able to naturally manipulate and play with scanned 3d objects using our hand - and finger - sensing technology			1
@entity5 claims its technology will change how people interact , because next generation devices will see , hear and feel their users			0
they will use advanced depth cameras as eyes and duel array microphones as ears , while people will use more precise hand and finger gestures to navigate screens			2
facial recognition and natural language voice technology will also let users edit content without relying heavily on typing with a standard keyboard , which takes up screen space on a tablet			0
@entity5 is keen to find new applications for its technology and has launched a $ 1 million ( £ 619,772 ) prize to encourage developers to create apps for the tablet .			0

@entity5 plans on including a 3d scanner into a tablet set for release next year
@entity139 would allow users to scan an object and manipulate the @entity21 on their screen using new and more precise hand gestures
technology could make @entity147 objects easier and gaming immersive
