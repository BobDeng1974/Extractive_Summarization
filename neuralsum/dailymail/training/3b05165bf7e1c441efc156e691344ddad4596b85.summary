@entity1 boss @entity0 has not ruled out making new signings in the january transfer window			1
the champions look to have a serious fight on their hands to retain their @entity8 crown with leaders @entity10 currently setting a ferocious pace			1
that might tempt @entity1 back into the transfer market at the campaign 's halfway stage , as might continued involvement in the @entity17			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 has refused to rule out making new signings in january @entity1 , who face @entity20 early next month , still have a chance of reaching the knockout stages of the @entity24 competition following tuesday 's stunning defeat of @entity26			1
' it 's a thing that maybe we will talk in a few weeks more , ' said @entity0			1
' but not in this moment			0
we are just focused on the @entity8 , focussed on the game in @entity31			2
' if we continue in the @entity17 we will have a lot of things to think about , but you must remember we have restrictions this year - restrictions that we can not bring in important players because we must leave them out of the squad for the @entity17			0
' so we will see but i repeat that at this moment it is not the first priority to talk about			0
we are not thinking about that because i think it 's important to trust in the squad that we have			0
' the restrictions @entity0 refers to are those imposed by @entity47 last summer after the club breached the @entity24 governing body 's @entity49 regulations			1
@entity53 's loan ends on december 30 and the club may want to replace the midfielder @entity1 were limited to a net spend of Â£ 49million in the last transfer window and also had to limit their @entity17 squad to 21 players , as opposed to the regular 25			1
fear of further sanctions will limit the amount the club are prepared to spend while the squad cap leaves little room for manoeuvre			0
one player the club would be able to replace , however , is former @entity66 midfielder @entity53 , whose loan from sister club @entity68 is due to expire at the end of december			1
there has been speculation @entity1 might seek to extend the deal to compensate for @entity76 's likely involvement in the @entity77 , but that might not stretch to the resumption of the @entity17			2
@entity0 maintains that a decision on @entity53 will not be taken until some time next month			1
@entity76 is due to fly off to the @entity77 after @entity82 which could cause problems ' when we have to make a decision , we will make a decision , ' said the @entity87			0
one obvious area @entity1 might wish to strengthen is up front , despite the prolific output of @entity91			2
@entity91 has scored 17 goals this season but fellow strikers @entity94 and @entity96 have netted just seven between them			0
the sale of @entity98 , forced partly for @entity49 reasons , has also taken away an extra option			0
but @entity0 , speaking at a press conference to preview this weekend 's trip to @entity103 , would not be drawn on that matter			2
he said : ' in this moment if i say i think that maybe we are not scoring too many goals , then everyone will think that we need more players			0
' but maybe we need to improve the performance of our players , the performance of the team , and that is for a lot of different reasons			0
' city do at least have the @entity8 's top scorer in @entity119 @entity91			2

@entity1 are currently third in the @entity8
@entity0 's side are eight points behind leaders @entity10
@entity0 has refused to rule out signing players in january
@entity1 may need to replace @entity53 , whose loan ends in december
