by @entity0 and @entity1 jurors cleared @entity3 after a question to the judge revealed they were apparently grappling with the difficulties of historical allegations			1
they offered a glimpse into their thinking when they asked the judge about the ‘ lack of supporting evidence and the passage of time ’			1
there was no forensic evidence put forward and in none of the 14 counts was there a corroborating witness to the alleged assaults			2
as @entity3 himself told the jury , after the court had heard the women ’s claims : ‘ it ’s their word against mine			1
’ cleared : @entity3 appears outside of @entity30 yesterday after being found not guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault the jury comprised eight women and four men – the same male - female split as the jury who cleared @entity40 star @entity39 last week			1
on the third day of their deliberations , they sent a question to the judge asking what to do if they believed a woman ’s testimony but had no additional evidence			1
the question read : ‘ @entity51 ( the prosecutor ) , in summing up , said if we believe that the complainant was telling the truth , then we must find the defendant guilty			1
' can you give us any guidance on how that should be weighed with the lack of supporting evidence and the passage of time so we are sure beyond reasonable doubt ? ’ in response , the judge reminded them the prosecutor had said that , if they concluded what the complainant said was accurate and truthful , then they should convict			2
the jurors went back into their room and continued deliberating for a further day			2
in the end , they decided to believe @entity3 ’s account			1
claims : the accusations had related mainly to @entity3 's time as a @entity81 @entity80 in the 1970s and 1980s historic cases : @entity3 was prosecuted as a result of @entity84 , launched in 2012 after @entity85 was exposed as a predatory peadophile			1
@entity3 is pictured here on @entity88 with @entity85 yesterday metropolitan police commissioner @entity89 admitted police were caught in a ‘ @entity92 ’ dilemma when considering historical sexual allegations			1
he said : ‘ i think if a victim comes to us and makes an allegation they deserve a thorough investigation			0
‘ and we can hardly turn them away			0
in fact one of the criticisms in [ @entity102 ] @entity101 is that in the past 20 , 30 years victims have been turned away and not listened to			0
it seems to me we are caught both ways			0
’ the jury that cleared @entity3 of 12 cases of indecent assault was made up of eight women - six of them young - and four men			1
by coincidence , this was the same gender breakdown as the jury at @entity114 that cleared @entity40 actor @entity39 of historic sex allegations last week			2
after a four - week trial , during which @entity3 arrived alone each day to spare his @entity119 wife the court ordeal , the jury deliberated for 21 hours and 50 minutes spread over four days			1
in the @entity39 case , the jury only retired for six hours			0
@entity123 was launched in october 2012 after @entity85 , who died aged 84 in 2011 , was exposed as a predatory paedophile who abused hundreds of victims			0
it has already cost £ 2.7million , of which £ 490,000 has been paid out in overtime to the 30 - strong detective team			0
the operation has also led to 16 arrests , with four people charged and five suspects remaining on bail			0
police also revealed yesterday that further victims had come forward alleging sex abuse by comedian @entity138			0
@entity138 , who was first held in november 2012 , is taking @entity140 action after he was bailed again yesterday despite assurances that a charge or release decision would be made			0
the 71 - year - old has been rearrested three times over further claims since he was first held			0
deputy assistant commissioner @entity147 said that additional alleged victims coming forward had lengthened the investigation			0
‘ all of the allegations deserve a thorough investigation			0
that ’s what we do , ’ he said			0
@entity156 ’s most senior prosecutor also faced difficult questions last night over her decision to charge @entity3			1
relief : @entity3 , shown in a court sketch expressing his relief at the not guilty verdicts , told the jury : ' it 's their word against mine ' director of public prosecutions @entity168 ruled last august there was sufficient evidence to charge the ex-radio one dj , real name @entity3 , with 11 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault			1
a few weeks later , he was charged with two more counts of indecent assault – bringing the total number of charges to 14			1
mrs @entity168 authorised the charges in her previous job as chief crown prosecutor for @entity183			2
in a statement announcing the initial charges last year , she made clear she had carefully considered the evidence given by officers on @entity84			2
she said : ‘ we have also decided no further action should be taken in relation to seven separate allegations against mr @entity3 as we determined there was insufficient evidence			2

jurors ' thinking was hinted at in *written* question to judge
they asked whether believing a witness meant they must find @entity3 guilty
but they then cleared him of 12 charges of indecent assault today
