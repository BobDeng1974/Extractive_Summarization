@entity0 would be well advised to dip into the transfer market for a striker , because if @entity4 carry on at this rate they will earn the dubious title of becoming the worst attacking team in @entity9 history			1
it ’s no secret that @entity4 have struggled for goals this season , netting just 11 times in 23 games , but their inadequacies are laid bare when compared with previous problem strikeforces			1
the infamous @entity18 side of 2007 - 08 – relegated after failing to compete all season , winning just once – managed more goals per game than @entity0 ’s side are currently trundling along at			1
@entity4 striker @entity23 looks frustrated during his side 's 5 - 0 defeat by @entity26 @entity0 does not believe his side have any reason to be lacking confidence in attack @entity31 has scored just three @entity9 goals for @entity0 this season @entity33 ( no 10 ) had more woe in front of goal after he failed to beat @entity37 their drought now stands at 10 hours and 12 minutes			1
it ’s led to growing calls for @entity0 to be shown the door by @entity43 , but the @entity44 appears to be safe for now			1
incidentally , @entity18 scored 20 times that fateful season under @entity45 and @entity46			0
@entity4 need nine more to draw level with 15 games remaining			2
they would n’t even manage that if nothing changed			0
the teams currently have an identical record after 23 games which , given the @entity56 ’ terrible run of form , makes very grim reading indeed			0
the two teams have the joint - worst record at this stage			0
@entity0 has wanted to land a striker this month but it remains to be seen whether he can get a body in to truly compete with @entity23			2
one of the major problems for @entity4 , of course , has been the failure to get the @entity68 firing after he recovered from injury			2
they need to get someone in , otherwise the responsibility to score more goals befalls @entity33 and @entity31 ; nobody wants that			2
the pair are @entity0 's top scorers in the league			0
three each after playing more than 40 games combined			0
it is a shambolic return and one which does n't appear ready to change any time soon , with @entity82 to come next weekend			0
@entity83 was part of the @entity18 team to have failed miserably in the @entity9 in 2007 - 08 @entity86 chips the ball over the on - rushing @entity88 to score the opening goal of the game @entity91 fires in the @entity93 ' second goal after a well - timed through ball from @entity86 @entity95 bends in @entity26 's third goal of the afternoon after being set up by @entity97			1

@entity26 *thrashed* @entity4 5 - 0 at the @entity99 on *sunday* afternoon
@entity4 have not scored a @entity9 goal in more than 10 hours
@entity0 *insists* that he always sets his side up to score goals
@entity106 are now just three points off the relegation *zone*
