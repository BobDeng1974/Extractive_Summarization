a woman is set to scale one of the world 's highest mountains for a second time after she forgot her first climb because of altitude - related amnesia			1
@entity7 first reached the top of @entity9 in 2012 but suffered altitude sickness during the entire expedition			1
the 53 - year - old reached the summit of @entity15 's highest peak but had to be escorted down by a doctor and the illness caused her memory to black out			1
@entity7 first reached the top of @entity9 in 2012 but suffered altitude sickness during the entire expedition			1
she is pictured on her first ascent @entity22 ( pictured ) reached the summit of @entity15 's highest peak but had to be escorted down by a doctor and the illness caused her memory to black out it left the office worker with a five - hour gap in her memory including the moment - she was later told by fellow climbers - she watched the sunrise from the almost 20,000ft - high peak			1
she has a series of photographs of her taken at the top but can not remember ever being on the climb - where she raised money for @entity39			2
but she is now determined to get the memories back - by climbing the mountain a second time			2
ms cree - known as @entity44 - of @entity45 , west @entity46 , said : ' i was suffering quite badly with altitude sickness during the climb			1
' my face swelled up and i looked almost unrecognisable			0
the last thing i can remember is five or six hours after the summit when we were climbing down			2
the condition left @entity7 ( right ) with a five - hour gap in her memory including the moment she watched the sunrise from the almost 20,000ft - high peak ' the doctor said i 'd get my memories of that particular six hours back , but they never came			1
and now i 've got to do it all over again			0
' during the first climb ms @entity7 and her group of sixteen others camped only a couple of hours away from the peak and raised around Â£ 65,000 for the @entity67			1
she can not remember the last remaining stretch of the climb but can just about recall being at @entity9 - 200m from the top			2
ms @entity7 has now jumped at the chance to be part of a 35 - strong team attempting to climb the mountain in january , once again for the @entity67			1
she said : ' i suppose it 's a bit ironic that i 'm climbing to raise money for @entity39 's but i can not remember doing it			2
ms @entity7 ( pictured ) has now jumped at the chance to be part of a 35 - strong team attempting to climb the mountain in january , once again for the @entity67 ' i love doing things for charity , and i wanted to raise money after the sudden death of my mum at @entity87 in 2010			1
' i never got to say goodbye , so i wanted to go somewhere high enough to say goodbye to her properly			0
' i must have done that when i got to the top , but since i ca n't remember , i want to do it all over again			0
' best friend @entity91 , 62 , hopes her friend will be able to remember the experience this time around			0
she said : ' @entity44 is the strongest person i know , we 're like sisters			0
on the first day her knee went , but she strapped it up and carried on			0
that 's the type of woman she is			0
ms @entity7 ( right ) can not remember the last remaining stretch of the climb but can just about recall being at @entity9 - 200m from the top ' and to do all that and go all that way to not remember the final bit , the thing that kept her going up the mountain , is just too cruel			1
' that 's why she 's doing it again			0
i 've got nothing but admiration for her			0
' memory loss is a common symptom of acute mountain sickness , caused by the body struggling to cope with a lack of oxygen at high altitude			2
the potentially fatal syndrome can occur at altitudes above 5000ft			0
climbers usually spend time adjusting to the high altitude at a specialist camp to prevent the condition .			0
