by @entity0 when planners in @entity3 were asked to construct a new railway line in a residential area , they came up with an ingenious way of getting round the problem of demolishing people 's homes – by building the track so it runs right through them			1
the astonishing train line runs right through the middle of the building in @entity15 , known as @entity16 for its countless skyscrapers , and is one of the most heavily populated areas in @entity3 with nearly 33 million people			2
planners behind the monorail said they were forced to come up with the plan to cope with overcrowding in the city			0
there is even a small station which is captured in the footage shot by a passenger on the train			1
but instead of blighting residents ’ lives with the sounds of trains passing through , planners claim the train line has increased the value of the apartments because it is so convenient for transport links			1
according to them , the trains produces just 60 decibels of noise as it passes through the building — about at loud as a dishwasher			0
city transport spokesman @entity44 told the @entity46 : ‘ our city is very heavily built upon and that can make finding room for roads and railway lines a real challenge			2
all aboard ! this train runs right through a block of flats in one of the most densely populated areas in @entity3 coming through : locals say there is limited noise produced by the train and it has boosted property prices ‘ sometimes there just is n't room on the ground so we have to think about going under , or over , or - in this case - straight through			1
‘ in a city as fast paced as this it was clear people wanted to get around quickly			0
extending the railway line this way was a gamble , but it was one that paid off			0
’ the news comes as hundreds face having their homes bulldozed in the @entity80 with the development of @entity82 , a high - speed railway line with trains running between @entity85 and @entity86 .			0

planners built track through apartment block - instead of demolishing homes
it lies in @entity15 - one of the most densely populated cities in @entity3
video footage shot by passenger shows it even has a small station
value of property has increased because of convenient transport links
