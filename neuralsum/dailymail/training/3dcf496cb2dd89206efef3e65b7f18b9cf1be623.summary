@entity0 of @entity1 cemented her status as a senior royal today as she led one of the tables at the @entity7 lunch today held in honour of the @entity9			1
after a reception at @entity12 , @entity10 was one of a number of royals including @entity15 and @entity16 who attended the @entity19 livery companies lunch , held for some 700 guests representing abundant trades and professions , ranging from grocers and gunmakers to fruiterers and fishmongers			1
@entity10 was placed at the @entity28 and @entity29 table , a body founded in the 17th century as a trade association for the makers of pattens - under - shoes of wood and metal which were worn strapped beneath the shoes to raise the wearer out of the mud on the streets			1
prince @entity40 was at the @entity41 , while @entity42 took his place at the @entity44 and @entity46 table			2
guests at the lunch dined on marinated @entity50 salmon with @entity52 crab , followed by saddle of @entity55 lamb with braised shoulder of lamb , grilled @entity59 asparagus , @entity61 potatoes and an aptly named @entity62			2
@entity10 wore the demure dress with a matching hat by @entity113 , a milliner fast becoming a firm favourite with the royals , and nude @entity118 heels			1
it was the third time she has worn an @entity110 piece this weekend , having chosen something from the label , the same designer behind her lace wedding dress , at every jubilee weekend celebration so far , from her red pageant outfit to the coat she wore over her whistles dress for last night 's concert			1
the hat 's designer , @entity113 , who also saw the @entity132 wear one of her hats today said she was ' delighted '			1
' @entity135 of @entity1 and the @entity132 look stunning today			0
' they both have a unique yet timeless sense of style and wear hats so well			0
' it 's the dream to have two members of they royal family wearing my pieces to such an important event			0
' @entity10 and @entity40 were welcomed at the cathedral today by hundreds of well - wishers who had gathered outside the cathedral ahead of today 's service in which the archbishop of @entity152 , dr @entity151 , will give the sermon to mark the @entity9 's 60 years on the throne			1
the @entity1 wore a morning suit to today 's service to mark the @entity156			0
as one of the senior royals , @entity10 walked alongside @entity40 down the long aisle of @entity108 just ahead of the @entity9 as the monarch arrived for today 's service			1
just behind @entity10 and @entity40 walked the @entity161 and @entity162 , with the @entity9 making her way down at the back of the royal procession			1
chic : @entity0 wore pearls at her ears , subtle make up and pretty @entity110 lace dress royal blush : @entity10 shone in the slim - fitting dress , her slender waist accentuated by the ribbon belt stunning : @entity0 of @entity1 accessorised her @entity110 dress with a net - trimmed hat by milliner @entity113 composed : @entity10 looked the epitome of ladylike elegance at the service this morning close : @entity10 leans in to chat to @entity42 , who looked to be suffering slightly from the effects of a later night during the service @entity181 @entity113 , said she was ' delighted ' that @entity10 chose to wear one of her designs a family affair : @entity10 talks with her brother - in - law @entity42 as guests leave @entity108 demure : @entity10 looked the epitome of ladylike chic at the service , earning her praise from fashion critics including @entity192 , chairman of the @entity193 ladylike : @entity10 was flanked by @entity195 and @entity40 in smart morning suits for the service at @entity108 's today greeting : the @entity1 and @entity198 are welcomed to @entity108 's by the lord mayor of london a real @entity110 : @entity10 wore a dress designed by @entity110 's @entity201 for the @entity108 's service today beautiful in blush : @entity0 of @entity1 arrives with her husband the @entity1 in mint condition : the @entity9 waves as she arrives in a limousine with one her ladies in waiting , @entity210 , @entity211 who replaces prince @entity213 the royal procession : prince @entity42 , the @entity1 and @entity198 , prince @entity15 , @entity16 , and the @entity9 make their way the length of the cathedral ahead of the service of @entity219 seal of approval : @entity221 deemed today 's jubilee outfits a triumph well , today the boats were well and truly pushed out			1
for the service at @entity9 wore a soft mint coat dress : as for the flotilla on sunday , it is again designed by her dresser , @entity229			1
it is of silk tulle , embroidered with flowers , using silver thread			0
a chiffon drape is a lovely , soft touch : it is studded with @entity237 crystals , and a matching drape adorns the hat			0
@entity0 of @entity1 ’s nude lace dress by @entity201 for @entity110 was tailored perfectly to fit her figure – the hem a tad longer than the red dress for the flotilla on the @entity246 – and while i loved it , the fastening of the belt , seemingly made from bias binding , is a little disappointing			1
@entity10 ( and @entity201 ) need to understand that the @entity0 will often be seen from behind , and therefore the detailing needs to be beautiful : pearls or diamonds , with hand embroidered loops , not just a hook and eye			1
and i do want to wrestle @entity10 out of her platform patent pumps from @entity118			2
she needs delicate lace shoes , encrusted with pearls , by @entity260 , say , or an @entity262 shoe couturier , such as @entity263			0
the platform is a little too casual for such a formal @entity10 still looked stunning , especially as her eye make - up has been softened : i love the subtle veil over her eyes , on a hat by her favourite milliner , @entity113 : £ 790 , available on the milliner ’s website			1
the real surprise of the day was that both @entity273 and @entity274 looked fresh , young and appropriate			0
@entity273 wore a blue and white striped coatdress by @entity278 designer @entity276			0
@entity280 born , he studied at @entity281 ’s , and learned his craft on @entity283 and working for designers including @entity285 and @entity286			0
this dress was teamed with tan stilettos by @entity289 , a @entity291 hat and a @entity293 bag , made by sisters @entity295 and @entity296 , who worked at @entity297 and @entity285 before striking out on their own			2
this rock and roll bag label is made from start to finish in @entity280 , not merely ‘ finished ’ there , as so many are these days			0
this bag would have cost about £ 1,000			0
princess @entity274 chose a royal purple dress by @entity303 ( her lovely , small boutique is at 6 @entity305 , in @entity306 ) ; a @entity291 hat ; @entity289 nude stilettos and a @entity310 bag			1
i am starting to love these two young women : they champion brand new talent , know how to mix and match different labels , and have the good sense to wear @entity289 shoes , which are expensive but super stylish and comfy			0
@entity10 should follow suit , and abandon those high street platforms			2
she has such great legs : she really could take a dagger heel			0
@entity321 wore a rose print dress by @entity323 that we ’ve seen before , but at least she wore a hat , by @entity291			2
the @entity162 wore a graphic , basket weave coat by @entity327 , and a ginormous @entity329 hat			2
both items tell me she is feeling much more confident , starting to abandon those safe creams			0
all in all , a triumph .			0

@entity0 and each of senior royals placed at separate tables
@entity10 wore slim - fitting @entity110 dress designed by @entity201
@entity10 topped off demure outfit with hat by royal favourite milliner @entity113
