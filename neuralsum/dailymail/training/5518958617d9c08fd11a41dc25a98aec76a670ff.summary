by @entity0 published : 10:26 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 11:31 est , 23 september 2013 a woman who collapsed with a seizure discovered she had been living with a tumour half the size of her brain			1
@entity6 , 26 , had no idea she had the cancerous glioma tumour , which had been growing for 10 years , until she was rushed to hospital after a sudden seizure			1
the tumour was 10cm by 5cm - half the size of her brain			1
the young mum had never suffered any serious health problems before she fell ill suddenly on february 24			0
@entity6 ( pictured with her son , @entity16 ) , 26 , was diagnosed with a brain tumour after she collapsed while staying with a friend			1
doctors were amazed that she had not experienced any other symptoms ms @entity6 , who lives in @entity21 , @entity22 , had been staying at a friend 's house when she collapsed in the bathroom			1
she said : ' i had been staying at my friends pub in @entity28 and i woke up the next morning feeling unwell but thought it might just be a hangover			0
' i was numb all down my right side			0
someone handed me a can of @entity33 , i was holding it but i could n't feel it in my hand			0
' i hit my head on the bath but thankfully my friend @entity37 was there			2
' @entity37 , 25 , who now lives with ms @entity6 , raised the alarm and put her friend in the recovery position			1
she said : ' it was really scary but i knew @entity6 needed me so i stayed really calm			1
' ms @entity6 's tumour is slow - growing but she has had to have radiotherapy and may also require chemotherapy ms @entity6 was rushed to hospital in @entity48 where she suffered two further seizures before being transferred to @entity50 for an mri scan which confirmed the tumour on the left side of her brain			1
she said : ' it is a glioma tumour which is slow growing and is grade two on a scale of one to four , four being the worst			1
' the doctors could n't believe that i have had no symptoms			2
i have been through childbirth but felt nothing in my head			0
' the part of my brain affected is the area associated with emotions			2
' i am not an emotional person and i never cry			0
so that makes a bit of sense			0
' ms @entity6 underwent a biopsy and then radiotherapy at the @entity74 , in @entity75 , which she attended five days a week for six weeks			1
the tumour caused epilepsy which left her unable to drive			1
ms @entity6 , who is mother to 21 - month - old @entity16 , has amazed her friends and family with her resolve in the face of serious illness and gruelling treatment			1
she said she is determined to keep her spirits up for the sake of her son and added : ' @entity16 has no idea , he keeps me going			0
' i have been told that it could flare up again in the next 10 to 20 years and i could need chemotherapy			2
' but i do n't want to know when that might happen and i am not waiting around for it			0
' ms @entity6 is now epileptic so is not allowed to drive			1
she gave up her job as a hair dresser to do charity work and to spend more time with @entity16 ms @entity6 was given good news when a scan revealed her tumour had not increased in size and the pressure in her head had reduced			1
she said : ' the tumour was never going to get any smaller but it is good to know that the pressure is reduced			2
' the doctors told me that they are really surprised that i was n't crippled with headaches because of the pressure in my brain			2
more than half of all primary brain tumours are gliomas			1
they develop from the glial cells in the brain and are malignant but slow - growing			1
symptoms include headaches , nausea , vomiting , seizures and vision problems			1
gliomas are rarely curable but the prognosis depends on the grade of the tumour - they are graded from one to four with grade one and two tumours counting as low - grade and grade three and four tumours counting as high - grade			2
the most common forms of treatment are radiotherapy and chemotherapy			2
patients with high - grade gliomas only have a 50 % chance of surviving for a year after diagnosis			0
people with low - grade gliomas have a 50 % chance of living for ten years after their diagnosis			0
' there is a chance that it will grow again in the future and i will need chemotherapy but for now i just have to monitor my symptoms and go for regular checkups			2
at the moment i feel fine			0
' ms @entity6 's positivity has amazed her proud family and her mother @entity152 said of her daughter : ' nobody could fill @entity6 's shoes - i do n't know where she gets the strength			1
' ms @entity6 is determined to live her life to the full and has given up her hair salon in @entity21 to spend as much time as possible with her son			2
after discovering her tumour she has selflessly decided to dedicate her time to helping others			0
she organised an action - packed fundraising night in @entity21 recently and hundreds of friends and family members turned up to support her			0
she said : ' it was a great night and i would like to thank everyone who donated so generously			0
' we raised £ 3,000 for @entity171 and £ 3,000 for @entity172			0
' my target was £ 5,000 so i am really pleased that i managed to raise so much			0
' life is what you make it			0
if i lie down and let this tumour beat me then it will			0
