@entity1 have just played the first game of their @entity4 tour in @entity5 and @entity6 is fulfilling his media duties			1
less than 48 hours earlier , @entity9 had revealed that he was retiring from international football			2
after 114 caps he felt he owed it to @entity1 to give them his undivided attention			2
so @entity6 was asked how he saw @entity9 ’s future			2
‘ i am very happy that @entity9 is going to commit to @entity1 and i am sure that ( his contract ) is something we will look at , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ i know he can continue to play beyond this season			0
i have always said that			0
@entity9 is a @entity1 legend and he deserves to be offered a new contract at @entity22 soon the midfielder 's contract is up at the end of the season and he can speak to foreign clubs from january 1 ‘ now he does n’t have international football , he will have that freshness			1
i am sure he will want it sorted out			0
you never want to leave players with not too long to go on their contracts			0
’ the esteem in which @entity6 holds @entity9 is beyond question			2
@entity36 was the headline act but in those final , high - pressurised months , nobody did more than @entity9 to try to drag @entity1 to the title			1
yet here we are , on november 1 , and @entity9 ’s future is still not ‘ sorted ’			2
it is a puzzling state of affairs			0
in 61 days , clubs around @entity44 will be free to talk to the 34 - year - old about signing a contract with them			1
they will be forming a queue			0
@entity1 looked set to win the @entity50 until they lost 2 - 0 against @entity51 at @entity22 last season @entity9 is the key link between the fans on the terraces and the players on the pitch at @entity1 a lot has been made of @entity9 ’s form this season but it has n’t been anything like some have made it out to be			1
he is @entity1 ’s joint - leading scorer and has played every minute of every @entity50 and @entity65 game			1
if @entity9 were to come on the market , there would be many courting him			2
clubs in @entity69 , for example , and the @entity71			0
more than that , though , how many @entity65 managers would take the chance to let their interest be known ? the rampaging box - to - box bursts of his youth may have been phased out but the way @entity9 passes and strikes a ball remain as sweet as ever			1
there will come a day when he no longer wears @entity1 red , but that should not be next season			1
and it is not just about what he does on a match day			0
a young @entity9 making his @entity1 debut against @entity89 in november 1998 the @entity22 icon has a very specific fitness regime to keep himself in shape throughout the season ‘ @entity9 is a brilliant role model for me , ’ said @entity95 , one of the brightest hopes at @entity1 ’s academy			1
‘ just watching him train helps me loads			0
’ @entity9 continues to set an example , to lead the club			2
there has been talk of him becoming an ambassador when he retires but he has been doing ambassadorial work for @entity1 throughout his career			1
last week , his programme notes against @entity108 signed off with a mention that his cousin @entity110 , one of the 96 who lost their lives at @entity113 , would have been 36			0
‘ he and they are never far from our thoughts , ’ @entity9 wrote			0
@entity9 , laughing in training , is @entity1 's joint - top scorer this season and has played continuously @entity9 , challenged by @entity122 , was man - marked in defeats by @entity124 and @entity125 since @entity126 retired , @entity9 has been the link between the pitch and the terraces			1
that @entity1 ’s owners have let it get to this point suggests they do not quite appreciate @entity9 ’s importance to this club			1
allowing the situation to drift has been ham - fisted , and not telling the club captain of their plans lacks courtesy			0
clubs tend to take older players for granted			0
think of @entity51 with @entity141 , @entity142 with @entity143			0
yes , it makes business sense not to offer those in their 30s long - term deals but it does not mean they should be cast to one side and dealt with last			0
of course , all this may be resolved before the new year but the dithering has resulted in @entity9 raising the prospect that he may play elsewhere next season			1
it should not have come to this			0
@entity1 boss @entity6 is a huge fan of @entity9 but the midfielder has not yet signed a new deal			1

@entity9 is @entity1 's joint - top scorer and has played continuously
contract expires at end of season and can talk to foreign clubs in january
it is *ridiculous* that it has come to this because he deserves so much more
he is the connection between the terraces and the pitch at @entity22
