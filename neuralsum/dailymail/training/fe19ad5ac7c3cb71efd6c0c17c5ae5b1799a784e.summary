by @entity0 published : 10:49 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 13:05 est , 14 january 2014 a blind pensioner who has raised thousands for national charity @entity3 has been refused a replacement dog following her previous dog 's retirement , and she says its because the charity say ' she walks too slowly '			1
@entity8 , 80 , from @entity9 in @entity10 had her guide dog @entity12 retired by the charity after it chewed and swallowed part of a wool glove and required surgery have it removed from its stomach			1

after this , she was told that not only will alfie not be returned , but she will also not be provided another guide dog			1
she said : ' they said they were taking @entity12 away because i could n't look after him			0
' they said i could n't have another dog because i walk too slowly			0
' i ca n't get my head around it			0
i feel after 25 years of being able to go out and about , now i ca n't because i have had to revert back to a white cane			1
' i am 80 and learning to use a white cane is not an easy task			1
' my walking has suffered because i have not been able to get out and about			0
i 'm stuck at home waiting for any kind of person to come and take me for a walk			0
' @entity8 and @entity12 display @entity49 pride in july 2012 , when she was nominated to carry the @entity49 torch through her town @entity26 spent years raising money for @entity3 , and in july 2012 was nominated to carry the @entity49 torch through her home town			1
since losing her guide dog , she has been unable to do work for the charity , such as speaking at schools , because she does n't have a guide dog to accompany her			1

i 'm not the person i was			0
' a spokesman for the charity said : ' we care very deeply about the health and well being of our guide dogs and , as mrs @entity8 ’s dog was experiencing health issues , we made the difficult decision to retire him early			1
' we understand that losing her guide dog has been a very tough for mrs @entity8			1
guide dogs are life - changing for their owners and so to be parted from one can be difficult			2
' in circumstances such as these , we assess the our service user ’s needs individually to see if there are other ways we can help them to get out and about on their own terms , and we ’re now supporting mrs @entity8 with long cane training and our @entity89 sighted guiding service			2
in happier days : @entity8 is devastated that her dog has been confiscated ' for someone to qualify with a guide dog we need to know that they would be getting out and about on a regular basis with their dog , have appropriate living conditions and would be able to care for their dog accordingly			1
' ' a guide dog has to act as a mobility aid to its owner and needs to have a sufficient work load			2
' ' before anyone can be matched with a new guide dog , regardless of whether they have had one before or not , they need to be individually assessed			2
for someone to qualify for a guide dog the charity needs to know that they would be getting out and about on a regular basis with their dog			1
the are also in charge of making sure the dogs have appropriate living conditions and that the owners would be able to care for their dog accordingly			0
since the surgery , @entity12 was left in poor health and requires constant attention and care			2

@entity8 has had guide dogs for 25 years : she lost her sight years *ago*
her previous guide dog , @entity12 , was ' retired ' after health issues after surgery
now 80 years old , she has now been forced to learn to use a white cane
she says a new dog will not be provided , because she walks too slowly
can no longer give talks *benefiting* the charity in schools because of health
