@entity0 , the outgoing president of the @entity1 , said @entity2 was an anti-gun activist even in the years before he sought public office in an exclusive interview with @entity5 , outgoing @entity1 president @entity0 said @entity2 ' knows better ' than to claim @entity7 guns are to blame for violence in @entity9			1
' i would rank the president 's statement about @entity7 guns being responsible for the mayhem in @entity9 right up there with the ads running before the election that said that he was n't opposed to @entity18 rights			2
the fact of the matter is , he knows better			0
' @entity0 spoke to @entity5 on the convention floor at the @entity1 's annual meeting and convention in @entity25 , @entity26			1
@entity2 claimed friday during a speech at @entity9 â€™s @entity28 that ' most of the guns used to commit violence here in @entity9 come from the @entity7			0
' the comment was roundly criticized by gun - rights defenders and repeated in media outlets that have been traditionally unfriendly to the @entity1			2
@entity35 told @entity5 that president @entity2 's recent public push for new gun control laws is a natural extension of his political positions through the years			1
' this guy was an @entity41 activist long before he ever ran for office , ' @entity0 said			1
' he had said in the past that he did n't believe any private citizen has a right to own a firearm , ' he continued			0
' he has supported legislation that would have banned the ownership and manufacture of sidearms in @entity7			0
' controversial : incoming @entity1 president @entity51 has reportedly called @entity2 ' a fake president , ' and referred to the @entity52 as the ' @entity53 ' an attendee holds a @entity56 pistol during the @entity1 meeting in @entity25 - a gun @entity0 says president @entity2 once wished to ban the @entity1 's @entity0 knocked president @entity2 's campaign ads that claimed he would protect gun owners ' second amendment rights in a second @entity63 term ' so it was our belief that he could n't afford to do anything , politically , before the election			1
and of course his campaign actually ran ads saying " @entity2 will support your right to keep and bear arms "			1
' asked if that claim in the president 's re-election campaign ads were lies , @entity0 was diplomatic			1
' well , ' he said , ' they certainly were n't truthful			2
' the @entity63 did not respond to requests for comment about @entity0 's accusation			1
@entity0 's term as @entity1 president ends monday			1
the position is awarded on a rotating basis to a different @entity1 officer every year			0
his successor , @entity51 , is an @entity88 attorney who spent the past 12 months as the organization 's first vice president			2
@entity51 warned @entity1 members during a speech on friday that they are in the midst of an @entity7 ' culture war			0
' he he a history of fiery rhetoric , including calling @entity2 ' a fake president and saying attorney general @entity98 is ' rabidly un-american			1
' the @entity99 reported saturday that @entity51 is also on record calling the @entity52 the ' @entity53			0
' soft sell : ' guns save lives ' stickers at the @entity1 convention in @entity25 seem quaint compared to the bare - knuckle rhetoric that has become common in the national gun rights debate @entity0 said groups funded by @entity111 mayor @entity110 ( r ) , shown with @entity112 at the @entity113 in @entity114 , were helping a @entity116 activist disrupt town meetings in @entity118 on friday , according to the @entity99 , @entity51 called for every @entity7 citizen to be trained in the proper use of military firearms			1
this , he said , would allow @entity7 to defend themselves against future tyrannical governments			0
by comparison , @entity0 seems mild - mannered and almost docile			0
but he has no warm feelings for @entity111 mayor @entity110 , whose self - funded @entity128 organization has become a thorn in the @entity1 's side			2
inside the convention , gun lovers and gun vendors - like this man from the firearms retailer @entity131 - vied for the attention of the tens of thousands who descended on @entity25 for the year 's biggest gun rights event ' @entity110 's groups are spending a lot of money , even now , ' @entity0 told @entity5 , ' advertising in those states where @entity146 senators voted with the @entity1 ' on a failed @entity63 - approved legislative proposal that would have required universal background checks for gun buyers			1
activists funded by @entity151 , @entity0 said , ' are harassing those senators			0
two town hall meetings were broken up in @entity118 by one activist from @entity154 [ @entity155 ] who mayor @entity110 has , and they 're taking her around			0
' ' she was supposed to be here ... but that has n't happened yet			0
they 're trying to make it as uncomfortable as possible for people to support the @entity18			0
' the only protest that materialized at the @entity25 event included about 45 people at its peak , and was anchored by activists from @entity168 , occupy the @entity1 , and @entity169			0
the @entity1 convention attracted a reported 70,000 attendees and vendors			0
@entity0 said he 's not worried about @entity63 press secretary @entity174 's hint on friday that president @entity2 is still considering a raft of executive orders to implement gun control measures without the approval of the @entity63 and @entity179			1
' it 's very difficult for him to do as much as he might like via executive order , ' @entity0 explained , ' because , in fact , in order to fund the actions he might order , he has to go to @entity185			2
' a woman who called herself ' @entity187 ' ( @entity188 ) shouted ' @entity1 , go away ! ' along with a smattering of other protesters outside the @entity1 's @entity25 convention in @entity9 , @entity2 said @entity7 guns were responsible for most of the deaths in @entity9 related to gun violence ' we 're going to have a whole series of fights that are going to take place in @entity185 and elsewhere. , ' @entity0 added			1
' there 's no question , though , that @entity2 can make life miserable for gun owners			2
' but first , @entity0 said , he has to wrap up his tenure as the @entity1 's top dog			1
and then , he told @entity5 , ' i 'm going to get a knee replacement , and then i 'm going to go fishing			0

@entity0 , the @entity1 's outgoing top dog , said @entity2 's campaign ads about gun control ' were n't truthful '
@entity2 , he said , ' was n @entity41 activist long before he ever ran for office '
@entity0 's successor controversial called @entity2 ' a fake president , ' and referred to the @entity52 as ' @entity219 '
