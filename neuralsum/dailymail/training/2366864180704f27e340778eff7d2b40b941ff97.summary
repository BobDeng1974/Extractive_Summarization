by @entity0 published : 20:04 est , 6 october 2013 updated : 08:26 est , 7 october 2013 two cabinet ministers are at war over plans to slash green subsidies blamed for skyrocketing household bills			1
chancellor @entity6 wants to use his autumn budget statement to raid the power giant ’s energy tariffs			1
but he is facing a battle with @entity11 energy secretary @entity11 , who does not believe there is any justification in tearing up previously agreed targets			1
the chancellor has been angered by @entity17 leader @entity16 ’s plan to freeze energy bills if elected			1
clash : @entity11 energy secretary @entity11 ( left ) was incensed by @entity6 's plans to abandon carbon targets mr @entity6 blames mr @entity16 ’s ‘ green ’ policies as @entity17 ’s energy secretary for helping force up bills			1
figures released yesterday show that families face paying an extra £ 425 over the next five years to pay for subsidies to meet green energy targets			1
the total subsidy - levied on householders and businesses - will be nearly £ 22 billion by 2020 , according to figures produced by the @entity31			2
the money will go towards paying for controversial onshore and offshore windfarms , biomass plants , landfill gas siets and hydro power plants			0
the chancellor won applause at @entity44 conference when he pledged that @entity45 would not be at the forefront of tackling climate change			1
but mr @entity11 believes there is no justification for back - sliding on carbon reduction targets			1
almost £ 2 billion was spent subsidising renewable energy in the last financial year			2
but this will rise to £ 5.3 billion a year by 2018 - 19			0
wind farms will account for the majority of the rise			0
@entity56 , @entity31 chief executive , said subsidies for renewable generation should instead be used to support research aimed at bringing down the cost of green power			0
he said : ' targets that require massive investment in the energy sector , to install expensive technologies like offshore wind turbines on an enormous scale , will always mean profits for energy companies and much higher prices for consumers			2
costs : wind farms account for the majority of the rise in money spent on renewable energy ‘ if the government are serious about easing the pressure on people ’s living standards , they need to take action and scrap lavish renewable energy subsidies			0
‘ and it is a joke for @entity16 to pretend he is taking on the @entity85 on behalf of consumers when he is proposing to keep the targets in place			2
' if politicians are serious about helping families with struggling bills , then they need to do something about dysfunctional and painfully expensive energy policies			1
’ dr @entity95 of the @entity96 , said : ‘ government subsidies which are added to electricity bills in order to meet over ambitious @entity101 climate change targets are complex , opaque , and very expensive for the consumer			1
‘ the subsidy costs are set to increase significantly and will last 15 to 25 years			0
' the scale of the consumer costs is shocking and senseless in view of the fact that @entity45 greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced faster and more economically by less extravagant measures			0
’ biomass plants ( pictured ) , landfill gas sets and hydro power plants are funded in controversial energy policies domestic energy prices are set to rise yet again this winter with the ‘ @entity85 ’ power firms blaming the increase on government and environmental levies			0
a spokesman for the @entity120 said : ‘ the government is transparent about the impact of energy and climate policies on bills			1
‘ it ’s the global gas price , not green subsidies , that has primarily been pushing up energy bills			2
60 per cent of the increase in household energy bills between 2010 and 2012 was caused by this			0
' investing in home grown alternatives is the only sure fire way of insulating our economy and bill payers from this volatility			0
‘ in any case , our household energy efficiency policies are on average more than offsetting the costs of clean energy investment			0
' by 2020 the average household bill will be £ 166 lower than it would be if we were doing nothing			0

@entity6 blames @entity16 's ' green ' policies for forcing up bills
families face an extra £ 425 over the next five years , figures show
the chancellor was applauded at the @entity44 conference for *announcing* @entity45 will not be at the forefront of tackling climate change
@entity11 energy secretary @entity11 said there was ' no justification ' for neglecting carbon reduction targets
