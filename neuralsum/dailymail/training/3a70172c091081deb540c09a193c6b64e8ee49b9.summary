regrettable : @entity2 chief executive , @entity1 , said the company ‘ should never have become part of @entity5 ’s dispute with @entity6 ’ giant @entity6 following protests by @entity10 campaigners			1
the @entity12 toy maker has announced it will not renew a current deal allowing @entity6 to hand out @entity2 sets at its petrol stations in 30 countries , following a viral online campaign			1
the campaign , which included a video showing an @entity21 landscape with a @entity6 drilling platform made of @entity2 bricks covered in oil , was orchestrated by @entity5			1
the three month campaign saw more than one million people signing a petition calling on the toy brand to stop promoting @entity6 ’s brand because of the claimed damage that will be caused to the @entity21 landscape			1
@entity2 chief executive , @entity1 , explained the decision by saying the protest against plans by @entity6 to begin drilling in the @entity21 next year ‘ may have created misunderstandings among our stakeholders ’			1
he said green campaigners should take up their concerns directly with the oil company , adding that @entity2 ‘ should never have become part of @entity5 ’s dispute with @entity6 ’			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ the long - term co-promotion contract we entered with @entity6 in 2011 delivers on the objective of bringing @entity2 bricks into the hands of many children , and we will honour it - as we would with any contract we enter			2
but he added : ‘ we continuously consider many different ways of how to deliver on our promise of bringing creative play to more children			0
‘ we want to clarify that as things currently stand we will not renew the co-promotion contract with @entity6 when the present contract ends			0
’ @entity2 refused to say when the current contract expires			0
@entity5 insisted the toy company was doing the right thing under public pressure and should choose its partners more carefully when it came to the threats facing children from climate change			2
the environmental group is calling for a sanctuary to be created in the @entity21 to protect it from drilling and industrial fishing , and for there to be no oil exploration in @entity21 waters as the melting ice cap makes the fragile region more accessible			0
it desperately needs partners like @entity2 to help give it respectability and repair the major brand damage it suffered after its last @entity21 misadventure			2
@entity2 ’s withdrawal from a 50 year relationship with @entity6 clearly shows that strategy will not work			2
’ campaign : @entity5 created a petition that was signed by more than a million people urging @entity2 to sever their relationship with @entity6 in response to the company 's plans to drill for oil in the @entity21 he added : ‘ @entity2 ’s decision could n’t have come soon enough			1
the @entity21 , and its incredible wildlife , like polar bears and narwhals , is under threat like never before			0
‘ arctic sea ice is melting at an unprecedented rate , but instead of seeing the huge risks , oil companies like @entity6 are circling like vultures			0
only weeks ago @entity6 gave us the clearest indication yet that it ’s planning to go back to the @entity21 as soon as next summer			2
’ @entity6 originally planned to drill around the @entity21 coast of @entity107 in 2013 and 2014 , however it did not go ahead because of technical problems linked to the extreme weather			1
end of an era : after 50 years working together , @entity6 will no longer be allowed to hand out @entity2 sets at its petrol stations in august , it filed a revised @entity21 offshore drilling plan with @entity114 regulators but said it has not decided whether to start in 2015			1
@entity6 said : ‘ our latest co-promotion with @entity2 has been a great success and will continue to be as we roll it out in more countries across the world			0
we do n’t comment on contractual matters			0
‘ we respect the right of individuals and organisations to engage in a free and frank exchange of views about meeting the world ’s growing energy needs			0
‘ recognising the right of individuals to express their point of view , we only ask that they do so in a manner that is lawful and does not place their safety or the safety of others at risk			0
’ the sets involved in the promotion include @entity2 racing cars and a @entity6 petrol station			1
