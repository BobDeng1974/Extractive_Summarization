motive : @entity7 is now facing up to six months in jail and investigators say she did it because she was ' suicidal ' the claims were given even more credence by the fact that there had been another attack near the campus just days earlier when a @entity10 student was robbed and shot in the head while waiting for a bus			2

protection : @entity7 was covered by her father when she left court in @entity105 on friday after filing a not guilty plea for falsifying a police report ' they had sex and afterwards she used a cellphone screen reflection as a mirror to see if the injuries were bad enough			1
( @entity7 ) then directed him to hit her some more			2
' at court on friday , where @entity7 entered a not guilty plea on the charge of falsifying a police report , ms @entity100 said that the 20 - year - old is depressed and seeking medical treatment for mental issues			1
