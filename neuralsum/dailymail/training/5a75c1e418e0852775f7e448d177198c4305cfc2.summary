@entity0 today issues a passionate call for households around the @entity3 to fly the @entity5 flag to show their backing for a no vote in thursday ’s historic referendum			1
with just four days to go until the crunch vote – and with the polls neck and neck – the prime minister called on families across @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , to put the @entity18 in their windows in support of the @entity21			1
mr @entity0 ’s rallying cry came as a new poll published yesterday put the no vote eight points ahead			1
according to @entity29 , in a poll commissioned by the @entity21 camp , the no vote is running at 54 per cent while @entity30 is on 46 per cent			1
mr @entity36 said : ‘ the situation is fluid			1
if we vote to leave by one vote there is no going back			0
we will have bought a one - way ticket			0
’ his warning seemed prescient last night as @entity48 was shaken by an @entity50 poll for the @entity51 which put @entity30 on 54 per cent and @entity52 on 46 – though polling experts warned that the small survey size of 700 meant that it was vulnerable to a ‘ sampling error ’			1
an @entity57 poll for @entity58 put no on 53 and @entity30 on 47			1
in his interview , mr @entity0 said the vote was ‘ going down to the wire ’ and he hoped a final lovebombing from around the @entity3 could persuade the undecideds to vote no. describing the contest as ‘ nerve - racking ’ , he said : ‘ there are lots of things [ people could do ] whether it is using social media , tweeting and blogging your support for the @entity3 ; whether it is phoning a friend , talking to relations or work colleagues who live in @entity5 and have a vote			1
he wants families across @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 to put the @entity18 in their windows ‘ or whether it is more visual demonstrations – hoisting the @entity18 over buildings , putting a flag in your window – there are any number of things people should do			1
’ however , as mr @entity0 was urging support for the union , a @entity93 poll of voters south of the border was pointing to a growing backlash against the idea of granting extra powers to the @entity5 to persuade them to vote no. the ‘ devo - max ’ cross-party deal , including scope for @entity5 to set its own taxes , was hastily brokered by @entity103 last week after a poll put the @entity30 camp ahead			1
the new poll found that 43 per cent of @entity15 and @entity16 think the move was a ‘ panic measure ’ , while 61 per cent object to the fact that @entity5 already receives the highest level of per - head public spending in the @entity3			1
just 12 per cent think that @entity114 should bail out an independent @entity5 if it runs into financial trouble			0
the knife - edge final days of the campaign have contributed to party turmoil for both mr @entity0 and @entity119			1
one senior @entity121 mp confided to this newspaper that a ‘ clear majority ’ of conservative mps expected mr @entity0 to resign if the @entity5 vote for separation , and that his leadership could still be in trouble if the pro-union camp prevails on thursday			1
the mp , who holds an executive position on the party ’s powerful backbench @entity133 , said the rushed agreement to give the @entity5 greater devolution even if they voted to stay had annoyed rank and file @entity125			0
he said : ‘ more than 50 per cent of the parliamentary party think the pm should go if he loses			0
but there is also an iceberg contingent who will be restless if we win , because we have promised too much – and let @entity103 lead the way			0
’ he explained : ‘ a few mps are very visibly complaining , but an awful lot more are grumbling out of sight			0
’ mr @entity119 is facing internal ructions over mr @entity103 ’s promise of enhanced devolution powers , with shadow chancellor @entity151 complaining during a tumultuous shadow cabinet meeting that he was ‘ out of the loop ’ on the offer – and warned it could prevent a future @entity154 from ever passing a @entity155 if @entity5 mps were barred from voting			1
the @entity93 poll highlights how much is at stake for the @entity154 leader			0
@entity29 found that across the @entity3 , @entity154 ’s support is running at 35 per cent – a lead of four per cent over the @entity121 – enough to give mr @entity165 a @entity167 majority of 44 if a general election was held tomorrow			1
if @entity5 was excluded , @entity154 would be one point ahead , on 34 per cent , and mr @entity119 ’s majority would be slashed to just nine seats			0
during his interview , mr @entity0 insisted that the devo max plan in the aftermath of a no vote would be the final ‘ resting place ’ of devolution , and it would put an end to @entity181 leader @entity180 ’s campaign			1
the @entity139 said : ‘ the @entity3 is not indifferent , you hear lots of concerns about what it means for them , what it means for our standing , what the consequences would be			2
more than anything else from the rest of the @entity3 you get arguments of passion rather than arguments about detail , which i hope shows everybody knows how much we care about the @entity3			2
' scratch an @entity15 and you do n’t have to go very deep until you find an absolute passionate @entity202 and someone who believes in the @entity3			2
’ the @entity93 poll also found that the referendum campaign has stimulated support for an @entity207 , with 47 per cent backing the measure and just nine per cent opposed			2
it also showed strong support for a guarded border between @entity15 and @entity5 if mr @entity180 signed up to the @entity213 agreement , the @entity215 ’s open - borders programme			2
the prime minister will try to push home the no camp ’s advantage tomorrow with a major speech in which he is expected to pay tribute to @entity5 as ‘ a proud , strong , successful nation ’ and hail ‘ the patriotic vision of a strong @entity5 nation allied to the rest of the @entity3			2
’ responding to the eight - point poll lead for the no camp , mr @entity180 said : ‘ i think it is wrong because i think there is huge movement – and the movement is towards @entity30			1
‘ we ’ve had over the last week panic , heeby - jeebies from @entity48			0
the @entity30 campaign is going to win this campaign , and win it well			2
’ balls : @entity103 ’s transfer of tax - raising powers would be a nightmare taxing question : shadow chancellor @entity151 @entity151 has raised fears that handing massive new tax - raising powers to @entity5 – as suggested by @entity103 – could mean big trouble for a future @entity154 government			2
the shadow chancellor privately warned that @entity247 might have to be banned from voting on budgets for @entity15 and @entity16 if @entity249 gained control of income tax @entity252 that could leave a @entity154 government at @entity114 unable to pass finance legislation for the rest of the @entity3			1
mr @entity238 ’s concerns came amid predictions that @entity154 leader @entity119 will be ‘ fatally wounded ’ if @entity154 supporters in @entity5 vote ‘ yes ’ on thursday			0
a rapid timetable to hand @entity5 sweeping new powers over income tax rates and finance in the event of a ‘ no ’ vote was unveiled by ex-prime minister mr @entity103 last week in a surprise bid to reduce the likelihood of an independent @entity5			0
but at a behind - closed - doors meeting of @entity154 ’s @entity270 held the following day , mr @entity151 warned of grave implications for an incoming @entity154 government if mr @entity103 ’s plan went ahead			2
mr @entity151 said : ‘ if we give away the whole tax - raising power to the @entity276 , how can @entity247 then vote for a @entity277 in @entity15 ? ’ currently , 40 of the 59 @entity5 mps are @entity154 , with pollsters predicting mr @entity119 will need a sizeable @entity5 contingent at @entity114 to form a government with a workable commons majority after the @entity283 next may			2
a witness at the meeting said : ‘ it was clear what balls was saying			0
‘ he was wondering out loud how we would get budgets passed at @entity114 without @entity154 votes			0
it ’d be a nightmare			0
’ mr @entity119 had no answer to his shadow chancellor ’s concerns , according to reports			0
last night , senior @entity154 figures said there was mounting anger over mr @entity119 ’s ‘ failure ’ to energise the vital @entity154 vote to come out against independence			0
one said : ‘ if @entity119 ’s been unable to deliver @entity154 voters in @entity5 – and the figures point to that – it ’s another nail in the coffin for the party as a whole			0
‘ there would be a major debate about the leadership of our party			0

@entity0 said ' nerve - racking ' vote was ' going down to the wire '
urged people to use social media , tweeting and blog to support the @entity3
@entity50 poll put @entity30 on 54 *%* - but experts say survey size of 700 was too small
chancellor @entity36 warned 500,000 had not yet made up their minds
