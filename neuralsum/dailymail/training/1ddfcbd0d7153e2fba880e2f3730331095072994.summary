by @entity0 most parents like to boast about their children 's talents , but you might think @entity5 would keep her family 's special abilities to herself			1
the 38 - year - old is convinced her two youngest @entity9 10 , and @entity10 , eight , can talk to dead people			1
mrs @entity5 , from @entity12 , says they have made friends with more than ten spirits - including their own grandmother - in the past year			1
@entity23 , second from the right , has not been blessed with the gift haunted house : the attic where the @entity5 children claim to have talked to spirits she says the children talk about their new friends so much it feels as if they 're part of the family			1
' it all started a couple of years ago when @entity9 told me he had been visited by an angel in the night , ' mrs @entity5 said			1
' at first i dismissed it as being the product of an overactive imagination			0
but when @entity10 started talking about it too i started to listen			1
' it 's a gift and you either have it or you do n't			1
it is n't a hoax , i really believe my kids can talk to spirits			2
' the spirit visits began in 2011 at the family 's former home in @entity53 where , according to the children , the ghosts lived among them and even in their attic			1
in march this year , the family moved to a new home in @entity59 , @entity12 , but the children claim the ghosts relocated too			1
mrs @entity5 , a full - time mother , says she became a believer after experiencing a strange encounter of her own			1
she said : ' one night i was watching tv and i said to @entity9 if they are really here now ask one of them to tug at my trouser leg			1
' @entity9 asked , then a few seconds later i felt something prod my leg and i saw with my own eyes my trousers move			2
delighted : mother @entity5 says she ' really believes ' her children can talk to ghosts ghoulish friends : the communication began when @entity9 , right , said he had been visited by an angel in the night ' it 's incredible			1
now , they touch me all the time			0
they 'll poke me in the arm and touch me on the leg			0
i 've even been poked in the eye by a ghost			0
' they also made the television go fuzzy when @entity9 asked one to prove that he was there			1
' you have to experience it to understand			0
i 've always read things but i did n't have a true appreciation of it until i went through it with my children			0
' she added : ' i love having spirits in the house , i think it 's great			1
' i think it shows that anything 's possible and it gives me hope for when i pass away			2
i know that this is not the end and we carry on			0
' as an atheist , mrs @entity5 says she did n't raise her children to believe in ghosts and has not nurtured their psychic ability in any way			1
but the children , who are home - schooled , are convinced			2
among the ghostly guests are an @entity113 couple called @entity114 and @entity115 , who @entity9 talks to , along with an angel called @entity118			2
@entity10 has formed a bond with a young girl called @entity121			2
and , at her new home in @entity12 , she says she has seen a ghostly woman in a neighbouring garden , believed to be the spirit of an old woman who recently passed away there			2
@entity9 said : ' i used to have trouble sleeping because i always felt like someone was watching me			2
' i would wake up in the night and run into mum and dad 's room			0
' now when i see spirits i talk to them - and they talk back			2
i see them during the day and night			0
' he added : ' @entity138 and dad asked me if i was making this up and i 'm not - there really are ghosts in the house			1
' believers : mrs @entity5 , who home schools the children , says she has done nothing to encourage their psychic ability selected few : eldest child @entity23 , centre , has n't encountered the ghosts but says she would ' freak out ' if she did although @entity10 is used to her ghostly friends she admitted she still got ' freaked ' out by their late - night antics			1
she said : ' i used to get scared			0
when i first saw them i did n't know whether it was a spirit or my imagination			0
' now i see lots of them not and i 'm used to it			0
' while @entity5 is convinced her children have a special gift , @entity163 , who was raised as a @entity165 , is still skeptical			1
the 40 - year - old health and safety advisor said he had never experienced a ghostly encounter of his own			2
he added : ' i was raised in a religion that is definitely against things like spirits			0
' i am still a little bit cautious with my children when we talk about ghosts but they seem okay and it keeps them happy so i leave them to it			0
' i reacted with disbelief at first and a few times i thought they were based on imaginary friends			0
' but the children went in to so much detail when they were talking about them that as time went by i started accepting it			0
' he added : ' i 'm still not really 100 per cent convinced but i think there 's a little bit of truth in it			0
' my kids are n't liars and if you listen to how they speak they tend to be quite believable			0
' @entity5 and @entity163 's eldest , @entity23 , is the only child in the house not to have picked up a talent for talking with ghosts and has not seen any spooky goings on			1
she added : ' i do n't mind them but i have n't seen them			0
if i did i think i would freak out			0
