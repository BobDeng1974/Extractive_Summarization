by @entity0 published : 02:52 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 18:05 est , 9 december 2013 patients are having to wait longer than six hours in ambulances parked outside @entity4 departments			1
last week alone nearly 4,500 patients were kept in the vehicles for at least half an hour because staff were too busy to look after them			2
figures obtained by @entity9 under the @entity10 covered the three months until the end of october , and revealed that a patient in @entity13 was forced to wait six hours and 22 minutes , while another in @entity14 was held for five hours and 51 minutes			1
ordeal : a patient in @entity13 had to wait more than six hours outside an @entity4 ( file photo ) senior doctors and nurses said waits in most recent weeks could have been even longer			1
the figures will add to concerns that casualty departments are struggling to cope with the rising numbers of patients expected this winter			1
dr @entity28 , president of the @entity29 , which represents casualty doctors , said : ‘ these figures relate to the three months up until october			2
‘ they do n’t include the really pressured time of the winter and so it ’s unlikely these figures are going to improve – and that must be a cause for concern			0
there ’s always going to be a small number of patients whose transfer is delayed , but not to the extent of these figures			1
’ ambulance crews are meant to spend no longer than 15 minutes transferring patients from their vehicles and if they breach this limit , hospitals are fined			1
but if staff are too busy , the paramedics have to carry on caring for them and at times there may be dozens of vehicles queued up outside hospitals			0
it means the ambulances are effectively immobilised and unable to attend other 999 callouts , while patients are also at risk of deteriorating in the backs of vehicles			2
dr @entity62 , chief executive of the @entity63 , said : ‘ things are going to get that much worse			0
‘ it ’s very difficult now to discharge older people due to the huge cutbacks in social care			0
squeeze : the crisis in @entity4 admissions is only set to get worse with the onset of winter ( file photo ) ‘ an older person falls down , breaks a hip , has a hip replacement but then ca n’t go home because the infrastructure and carers are n’t in place			1
their discharge is delayed , then patients coming in to @entity4 end up on trolleys as there are no beds and everything becomes silted up			1
’ last year @entity87 and @entity88 was forced to put up a tent outside its casualty unit after 15 ambulances had to queue at a time			2
the trust was fined £ 3million for keeping patients waiting			2
and once inside hospitals , some patients are forced to wait even longer on trolleys before they are moved to wards			2
separate data from @entity100 shows that last week 4,476 patients waited for at least 30 minutes in ambulances – up from 3,783 the previous week			1
shadow health secretary @entity103 said : ‘ ambulances are trapped in queues at @entity106 , unable to hand over patients at bursting hospitals			1
ministers are leaving large swathes of the country without adequate ambulance cover			0
’ but @entity113 , deputy chief executive of @entity100 , said the number of ambulances queuing was down compared with the same week last year			0
she said : ‘ these long waits are the exception			0
we are not complacent , we want to make sure they do n’t happen			0
‘ whatever happens , individual patient safety will take priority			0
there will always be instances where , because of a particular patient and their illness , we do get the occasional long waits			0
if a patient is very ill , they may need to be treated in the ambulance			0

hospitals are *supposed* to admit patients within 15 minutes of them arriving in ambulances
but new figures reveal that they are *routinely* kept waiting for hours
the @entity4 crisis is set to get worse with the onset of wintery *weather*
