by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 took full advantage of @entity5 's decision to field a weakened team to strengthen their bid for a top - two finish in the @entity9			1
@entity5 coach @entity10 rested six members of his likely @entity13 final team and , although his makeshift line - up were far from disgraced , they could not match their opponents ' superior finishing as they succumbed to a 48 - 10 defeat			1
the @entity18 needed to win by 29 points to leapfrog @entity5 into fourth place and they reached their target courtesy of @entity23 's 24th @entity9 try of the season seven minutes from the end			1
with one eye on @entity26 , @entity10 made nine changes to the side that won the semi-final against @entity30 , giving a first start to full - back @entity32 and debuts to young forwards @entity35 and @entity36 off the bench			1
@entity2 coach @entity38 left out only scrum - half @entity39 and prop @entity41 from the team that performed so disappointingly against @entity43 in the semi-final and they went some way to making amends			1
@entity5 actually dominated the opening quarter , forcing three goal - line drop - outs and repeated sets , but without being able to supply the final touches to their promising build - up play			2
the @entity18 ' defence was up to the task and they struck twice on the counter-attack to open up a 12 - 0 lead			0
moving upwards : @entity2 took advantage of a weakened @entity5 side on friday night to win 48 - 10 left centre @entity58 got the opening try , taking advantage of a kind bounce after @entity32 was deceived by a kick from @entity63 , who then supported a long - range break by @entity65 to score the second			1
right centre @entity67 crashed through some poor defence to score a third @entity2 try on 22 minutes and kicked his third conversion before hobbling off with a leg injury			2
at 18 - 0 , the visitors were in danger of being blown away but they stuck valiantly to their task and pulled a try back on 26 minutes when left winger @entity75 took @entity77 ' long pass and produced a superb one - handed finish at the corner			0
@entity80 is likely to make way for the return of @entity84 winger @entity83 for the cup final but is doing his best to present @entity10 with a selection dilemma			2
the @entity5 almost scored again before half - time when second rower @entity89 was put through a gap on halfway by @entity93 and held off the cover on a blazing sprint to the line , only to be held on his back in @entity99 ' last - ditch tackle			0
however , there was no stopping @entity102 six minutes into the second half when he took @entity77 ' short pass to barge his way over despite the efforts of four defenders			0
@entity109 's conversion cut the deficit to eight points but @entity2 made the game safe with two further tries in a five - minute spell			2
@entity99 took @entity116 's cut - out pass to cross at the corner for the first of his two tries and prop @entity120 charged onto @entity122 's short pass to crash over by the posts			0
@entity124 added both conversions in the absence of @entity127 to make it 30 - 10 and then used an overlap to cross for his side 's sixth try on 65 minutes			0
as the visitors tired , @entity23 and @entity99 both went over in the last seven minutes as @entity2 emphasised their superiority and @entity124 took his goal tally to five from as many attempts .			0
