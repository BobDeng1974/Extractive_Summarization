by @entity0 an erotic novelist has told of the moment she visited a church to research her next book ... only to discover a bundle of blue @entity7 bags brimming with human bones			1
@entity9 popped down to her local chapel in @entity11 , southern @entity12 , to find inspiration for an original plot - line , when she was confronted with one she could scarcely have made up			1
and the author - whose last book was ' eroticism under the @entity18 ' - was so inspired by the macabre mystery that she now plans to use it in her next story			1
grim find : the bags were covered by a tarpaulin sheet and have been sitting there since parts of the church were dug up and rebuilt to allow wheelchair access ' i was thinking the book could be set in the @entity30 ages ... the @entity30 history is strong in this part of the country - a perfect setting for some kind of love triangle , ' she told @entity39			1
but that 's when she came across the collection of shopping bags containing dozens of remains that appeared long forgotten and left to gather dust			1
' there were around 80 skeletons , ' she added			2
' and it made me very angry about how they were just sitting there			2
some people at the parish told me the bones had been there since 2009			2
' she went on : ' it 's not fair that people are just left behind like that , so disrespectfully			0
for me , it does n't matter whether you 're alive or dead , a life is a precious and meaningful thing			0
too many people forget that nowadays			0
' macabre : she had popped down to her local chapel in @entity11 , southern @entity12 , to find inspiration for an original plot - line , when she was confronted with one she could scarcely have made up the bags were covered by a tarpaulin sheet and have been sitting there since parts of the church were dug up and rebuilt to allow wheelchair access			1
archaeologist @entity73 , who was part of the team which conducted the dig , told @entity39 that the bones may have been up to 500 years old			0
' our mission was to document and rebury the bones , ' he said			0
' but the reburial was delayed and i have no idea why			0
the plan was to rebury them as soon as possible , but that 's up to the church			2
the county board said they could n't leave church ground , and it became complicated			2
' while @entity73 denied putting the bones in the @entity7 bags himself , he admitted that it sounded like an efficient storage technique			1
' it 's not standard practice , definitely not for archaeologists , but the @entity7 bags are n't actually that bad , ' he added			1
' they 'd be great for stopping the moulding process			0
but it ca n't be that good to have them in the basement for so long			0
' meanwhile , ms @entity9 says the bones could prove useful in her next erotic novel			1
' you know , i just might put them in , ' she said			0
' i have to say i 'm tempted			0

@entity9 went to chapel in @entity11 , @entity12 , to find inspiration
then she *stumbled* across blue @entity7 bags with up to 80 human remains
it is believed they were dug up to make way for wheelchair access to church
it is thought some of the remains date as far back as the 16th *century*
she says she now plans to use the grim discovery in her next erotic book
