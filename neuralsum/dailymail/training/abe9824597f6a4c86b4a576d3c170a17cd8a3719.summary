by @entity0 published : 22:18 est , 7 july 2013 updated : 05:17 est , 8 july 2013 tourism is worth billions of pounds to the @entity2 every year but after 2010 's devastating earthquake and years of escalating crime , @entity3 has been left behind			1
now the government is attempting to rebuild the country by redeveloping the once buoyant tourism industry			1
the @entity9 , which shares an island with @entity3 , attracted 1.7million visitors in the first four months of this year alone			1
tourist push : @entity3 's @entity14 beach resort is relatively empty in peak times but the government is hoping it can emulate its @entity2 neighbours by attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors a year packed : @entity3 wants to build its economy on tourism , like the @entity9 , which attracted 1.7million visitors in the first four months of this year alone @entity3 hope jobs will be creating by emulating their neighbour and growing the economy on the back of its paradise beaches and weather			1
however , critics of the policy say it is moving too fast when much of the country is still lacking basics during as paved roads , drinking water and reliable electricity			1
crime , health scares , hurricanes and the monster earthquake of january 2010 have badly damaged the tourism that was once a mainstay of the @entity3 economy , attracting the likes of @entity44 and @entity45			1
the government is hoping a @entity48 - financed $ 13.2million ( £ 8.7million ) airport and new infrastructure on the southern island of @entity51 , and an $ 8million ( £ 5.3million ) development of the historic coastal town of @entity54 will help reverse the trend			1
however , it is a big challenge			0
the @entity14 beach resort north of the @entity3 capital @entity59 is crowded with @entity61 peacekeepers , aid workers , diplomats and missionaries , rather than tourists			2
officials say the tourism push will create more than 1,600 direct jobs and 6,500 indirect jobs			1
tourism generated $ 200million last year , tourism minister @entity70 said			0
the country 's entire budget is $ 3billion			1
@entity3 was once a haunt of the rich and famous who came in search of late - night voodoo ceremonies and rum - fueled revelry			2
but an @entity80 scare in the early 1980s sent the tourists packing , and years of political instability continued to keep them away			0
investment : officials say building of more resorts like this one in @entity87 , will create 1,600 direct jobs picturesque : @entity3 wants to see itself on its glorious beaches , such as the @entity92 beach ( pictured ) @entity93 : a water taxi waits for customers at the @entity96 in @entity87 , @entity3			1
many @entity3 welcome anything that will create jobs but some say the tourism push is too soon officials say the 2010 earthquake killed 316,000 people , and a cholera outbreak nine months later took more than 7,750 lives			1
today , the only mass tourism - 600,000 a year , according to @entity70 - comes from cruise ships stopping at @entity108 on the north coast where passengers can frolic for a few hours in a fenced - in resort			0
sen. @entity115 @entity114 said : ' there are a lot of things that need to be done before we can attract tourists , " he said in a telephone interview			0
' but steps are being made			0
the @entity123 's budget has more than doubled			0
under the previous government it was $ 2million ( £ 1.3million ) plus a $ 1million ( £ 670,000 ) loan from @entity48 's @entity128 oil fund			0
now it 's $ 4.7million ( £ 3.1million ) , and @entity128 is paying $ 27million ( £ 18million ) to finance development on projects that include @entity51 and in @entity54			2
it says it has signed off on 15 - year tax breaks and exemptions from import duties for 11 hotel and resort projects costing a total of $ 160million ( £ 107million ) , with nearly $ 100million ( 67million ) more in the pipeline or completed			0
it is also training a force of 53 ' tourism police officers ' who will learn @entity143 and @entity144 and be trained in first aid and customer service			0
devastation : more than 300,000 people died in the 2010 earthquake that flattened whole neighbourhoods too soon ? critics say the government should ensure there are countrywide pavements and clean water first while many in @entity3 welcome anything that can create jobs , some worry that the country is n't ready for a tourist invasion			1
the @entity123 says it has only 3,200 hotel rooms and @entity164 and @entity166 travel advisories say medical services are woefully lacking			0
the @entity169 's @entity168 advises against all travel to the country 's slum districts and advises caution in visits to other parts of @entity3			1
the government hopes to double the number of hotel rooms in two years			0
but the critics say @entity3 first has to improve its infrastructure			2
tourism minister @entity70 says @entity3 has to stand on its own feet			2
' if we want to be a sovereign country , if we do n't want to depend on other countries , we need to figure out ourselves how to move forward and how to get revenue , and tourism must be no.1 on the list , ' she said			0
each hotel room built creates two jobs and four indirect jobs , she said			1
last year the @entity190 designated @entity3 a ' major drug trafficking country			2
' meanwhile , the country faces tough competition from @entity2 neighbours offering cheaper holiday deals			0
@entity196 , a @entity166 charter carrier , flies weekly between @entity197 and @entity59 , and says it has brought in 120 tourists this year on holiday packages in @entity3 costing $ 1,399 to $ 1,600 .			2

the @entity3 government wants to hook country 's growth on tourism
@entity9 attracted 1.7million visitors from january to april , 2013
new airport being built in @entity3 and coastal town of @entity54 being developed
