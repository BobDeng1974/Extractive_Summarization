a 14 - year - old boy from @entity11 , @entity9 was arrested after he allegedly communicated with @entity4 men over a plan to use knives and swords to hack officers to death in @entity18 on @entity19 , which takes place this saturday			1

a security official told @entity71 that the terrorists then planned steal the dead officer 's gun and go on a shooting rampage which would not end until they were shot dead themselves			0
the alleged plot is similar to the killing of @entity78 , who was run over by @entity79 converts @entity80 and @entity81 outside his barracks in @entity83 before they attacked him with knives and attempted to behead him			0

' the nature of the communication is currently under full assessment and subject to investigation			0
' we are continuing to work closely with the police in @entity4 and @entity9 and i want to reassure the public that we have not uncovered an imminent attack in the @entity2 and there is no immediate threat towards the communities of @entity9 , the @entity95 and the @entity2			2
' @entity117 said : ' @entity118 and the @entity117 can confirm a link between the arrest of a 14 - year - old boy in @entity11 , @entity9 in the @entity2 on saturday with @entity122 , a joint @entity124 operation			1
' the nature of the communication will form part of the investigation and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further			0
' in the wake of the @entity18 arrests , @entity4 officials have ramped up security for @entity19 events , while police in @entity2 are reviewing the arrangements for @entity19 celebrations in the @entity2			1
this year 's commemorations are considered particularly significant , as april 25 marks the 100th anniversary of the start of the ill - fated @entity141 campaign , which led to the deaths of 11,500 troops from @entity4 and @entity144			2
horrors : soldiers pictured during the @entity141 campaign , which left thousands of @entity149 troops dead commemoration : the @entity37 and the @entity38 pictured laying a wreath at the @entity35 in 1990 , the 75th anniversary of the campaign ; they are set to do the same during a ceremony on saturday @entity33 is hosting three commemorative ceremonies on saturday - a dawn service at @entity158 , a wreath - laying ceremony at the @entity35 on @entity160 and a service of thanksgiving at @entity36			0
the @entity37 and the @entity38 are due to attend the services at the @entity35 and @entity36 , while the @entity164 will join them at the @entity35 and princess @entity166 will attend the dawn service			0

deputy assistant commissioner @entity172 of the @entity173 said over the weekend : ' following counter-terrorism arrests in @entity4 this weekend and allegations of attack planning against @entity19 commemorations and police officers in @entity4 , we are reviewing security plans at related events in the @entity2			1
' we already have protective security plans in place for major @entity19 events in the @entity2 but as a sensible precaution all forces have been asked to review security arrangements at related events to ensure they are safe and secure for the public and officers			1
' while there is no information to suggest a specific threat to related events in the @entity2 - and the current @entity2 threat level remains unchanged - the public should remain vigilant			0
' at least 50 events commemorating @entity19 are set to take place in other parts of the @entity2 this weekend , including services at @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203			2
@entity4 police said on saturday that @entity205 and another 18 - year - old were planning to use ' edged weapons ' to attack officers in @entity18 while @entity19 celebrations are taking place			1
the teenagers were said to be inspired by @entity214 extremist @entity212 , who was shot dead by police in september last year after he attacked officers with a knife outside a @entity18 police station			0
like @entity2 , @entity4 has been suffering from an apparent upsurge in would - be jihadists as the rise of @entity222 has attracted young @entity4 to fight in the @entity223 and plot terror attacks at home			1
