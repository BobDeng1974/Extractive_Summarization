by @entity0 published : 06:50 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 12:15 est , 30 may 2013 pioneering pilots who died leading the way into @entity4 ’s @entity3 will be given a permanent memorial			1
plans have been unveiled for a memorial centre to honour the pilots and crews who died at @entity10 in @entity11 , which was used as a training base for flying early jets like the @entity14			1
the base , located between the villages of @entity10 and @entity17 , was in operation from 1926 to 1958 - but only some patches of land covered in concrete and abandoned buildings now remain			1

a memorial centre will honour crews remembered : the village of @entity10 in @entity11 has 13 graves of those who died at the airfield historian @entity39 is hoping to build a permanent centre in @entity10 , which will also look at the use of the airfield			1
he said : ‘ after the @entity43 and the inception of the @entity45 , this would have been the earliest days of that new organisation , and they were scouring the whole part of the southern region of the country looking for a suitable site			2
‘ after they came to @entity54 they did n’t look any further - back in those days there were n’t many trees to worry about , no electrical overhangs			2
it was a pilot ’s dreamland , really			2
’ the village of @entity10 has 13 graves of those who died at the airfield and , according to mr @entity39 ’s research , another four pilots lost their lives at sea during sorties over the @entity67			1

@entity98 , of @entity99 , @entity100 , worked on combining gas turbines and jet propulsion while at the @entity103 and filed his first patent in the 1930s			2
with the threat of war towards the end of the decade , the government began to back his idea to give the @entity112 more strength in the air			0
the first aircraft to fly with a @entity98 gas turbine was the @entity117 / 39 in 1941			0
its technology was shared with the @entity120 to help the war effort			0
the first ever jet airliner took off in 1952 from @entity123 to @entity124 , with five stops			0
the @entity126 was hailed a success , but had three fatal accidents in its first few years			0
it was later realised that a major design flaw resulted in an area of the aircraft constantly weakened at high altitude until air burst through a small gap			0
all of the planes were grounded and redesigned , before they went back into commercial service in 1958			1
but many airlines then opted for the new @entity120 @entity139 and the @entity140			0
‘ we ’re talking the early 50s , ’ mr @entity39 said			0
‘ although people do n’t realise it , these jets - or the early versions of them - were flying in 1951 , 1952			1
they were doing a lot of low - level flying here with sorties out over the @entity67			0
' some of these were not ejector - seat installed , so really there was no chance of escape if something went wrong at low level			0
‘ a friend of mine , @entity158 , was as a young boy offered a flight in one of those but he turned it down , as they were known as flying coffins			0
’ the aim is to collect more stories from people who worked or lived near the base to compile a history of the airfield			1
this project will also run in tandem with fundraising efforts for the new centre .			2

@entity10 in @entity11 was used as a training base for jets
