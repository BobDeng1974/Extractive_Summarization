when high - energy electrons and ions from the sun hit @entity5 ’s upper atmosphere , they can excite atoms and create fantastic colours - which we see on the ground as auroras			1
and now a study has claimed that we could create our own auroras , by firing a particle accelerator into the sky from space			1
the intriguing research says that a beam fired from the machine would create artificial auroras – and it could even create lightning in the atmosphere			1
scientists in @entity23 have described how to create artificial auroras on @entity5			1
they said a particle accelerator could be sent 185 miles ( 300km ) up into space ( illustration of a satellite in orbit shown )			1
it would then fire high - energy beams back at @entity5 's atmosphere the study , published in the @entity34 , was picked up by @entity35 from @entity36			1
the accelerator being proposed would be three times stronger than anything like it before , producing a beam with particles 0.5 to 10 million electron volts			2
pulses of the beam would last just 0.1 microseconds			0
the accelerator would be located in space , 185 miles ( 300km ) above the ground , and would fire back towards @entity5 's atmosphere			1
there are two types of auroras on @entity5 - the @entity52 in the @entity53 , known as the @entity54 , and the @entity55 in the @entity56 , known as the @entity55			1
auroras occur when highly charged electrons from the solar wind collide with atoms of oxygen and nitrogen in the earth 's atmosphere at altitudes from 20 to 200 miles ( 32 to 320km ) above the planet ’s surface			1
the interactions between the charged particles give off light			0
auroral displays appear in many colours : red , yellow , green , blue , and violet			0
the color of the aurora depends on which atom is struck , and the altitude of the meeting			0
the common green hue is caused by colliding oxygen molecules at altitudes of up to 150 miles ( 240km )			2
it would be based on a instrument called the @entity85 for @entity86 ( @entity87 ) , which is being developed by the @entity88 and @entity89 , both in @entity23			2
‘ the authors say that employing such instrumentation would offer many scientific opportunities to study the behaviour of particles in the upper atmosphere , ’ wrote mr @entity35			2
‘ the paths of the electrons would trace out the arcing field lines of @entity5 ’s magnetic field , illustrating how they bend and snap during the intense geomagnetic activity caused by solar storms			2
‘ as they descend into the @entity5 ’s atmosphere , some of the electrons would strike atmospheric molecules , producing visible aurora - like emission			1
’ he added that the beam might even be able to trigger different forms of lightning , including red sprites and blue jets			0
for now the idea is only a concept , and there are no concrete plans to build it			0
but the team says that by proving it works , it could be a step towards actually making it			0

shown is the @entity52 above the @entity125 in @entity126 it would not be the first experiment with @entity5 ’s atmosphere , though			2
in @entity130 there is an ionospheric research programmed called the @entity132 ( @entity132 )			0
@entity132 is jointly funded by the @entity133 , the @entity134 , the @entity135 , and the @entity136 ( @entity136 )			0
it was established to analyse the ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and investigate the development of ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance			2
in @entity130 there is already an ionospheric research programmed called the @entity132 ( @entity132 ) , pictured			0
it was established to analyse the ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and investigate the development of ionospheric enhancement technology the station regularly uses a tool called the @entity132 ( @entity153 ) , a high - power radio frequency transmitter facility operating in the high frequency band			1
it is used to temporarily excite a limited area of the @entity158			0
@entity132 has been the subject of numerous unfounded conspiracy theories			0
it has been blamed for hurricanes , thunderstorms , major power outages and more , but no convincing evidence supports any of the claims .			0

they said a particle accelerator could be sent 185 miles up into space
it would then fire high - energy beams back at @entity5 's atmosphere
this would create auroras to study - and even types of lightning
