by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 02:17 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 02:17 est , 17 september 2013 police forces are costing taxpayers millions of pounds - because they can not agree details such as how many pockets their uniforms should have , an official report has warned			0
senior officers are unable to agree on which high - visibility jacket to buy for their officers and what model of handcuffs to use			1
they also disagree on what boots to buy and even what kind of paper to use			1
as a result , they were not saving money from bulk buying , mps said			1
break with tradition : @entity22 officers wear baseball caps which the force used to replace traditional helmets			0
uniform is not ordered centrally - so police waste millions because they do not buy in bulk the @entity29 also found some forces appeared to have no idea how much individual items cost - and were unable to provide the information			1
its report said that the lack of central procurement by the 43 forces in @entity38 and @entity39 had resulted in ‘ unacceptable ’ variations in the prices they paid for standard items of equipment			2
the price of standard issue handcuffs ranged from £ 14 to £ 43 and for boots from £ 25 to £ 114			1
forces even paid wildly different prices for identical items			0
one type of high - visibility jacket varied in price by 33 per cent between forces			2
different uniforms : police forces paid between £ 14 and £ 43 for handcuffs , mps said			1
here a @entity60 police officer can be seen stood outside @entity61 auditors found forces also disagreed on what kind of riot shields to buy , whether they should be round , curved or long , interlocking and how they vary in weight and thickness			1
some forces prefer shields with map holders and dog handling straps			0
@entity74 cost between £ 31 and £ 136 depending on the force			0
body armour varied in areas such as thickness and colour and in price from £ 203 to £ 410			2
the committee chairman , @entity81 , said forces ’ spending on equipment was £ 1.7 billion , making it essential they obtained best value for money so they could focus resources on fighting crime			1
‘ forces can make big savings through bulk - buying of items , but have been unable to agree on the most simple things , like how many pockets they should have on their uniforms , ’ she said			1
‘ we recognise that police and crime commissioners have authority over local spending but , as the department remains accountable for public money voted by @entity108 , it can not step back from value for money issues			0
’ there are 43 forces in @entity38 and @entity39 , each with its own elected police and crime commissioner , making it hard for them to reach agreement on such simple items as uniforms			2
the report revealed a similar collective buying approach by the @entity121 saved 30 per cent across the country			0
@entity124 , chief executive of the @entity125 ’ @entity123 said : ‘ it ’s an obvious and entirely avoidable waste of taxpayers ’ money that some police forces are paying three times as much as others for basic items			0
‘ some police chiefs are clearly getting better deals for local residents ’ cash , meaning more of their budget can be spent on fighting crime , rather than purchasing officers ’ boots and the like			0
‘ @entity143 cooperation is urgently needed between forces in order to secure best value for money because it would be inexcusable to allow the vast differences in procurement costs to continue any longer			0
