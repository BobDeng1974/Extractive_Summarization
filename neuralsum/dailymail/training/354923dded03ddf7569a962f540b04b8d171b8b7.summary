' we will not sign a final peace deal with @entity2 before all the prisoners are released , ' he said			1
in @entity2 , though , the release was accompanied by anger and frustration with prime minister @entity58 facing a public uproar over the move			1
with @entity58 expected to accompany the releases with plans to build hundreds of new homes in @entity66 settlements , the criticism came from some unlikely quarters			1
supporters of peace talks said the expected construction would destroy any goodwill created by the prisoner release , while hard - line allies criticised @entity58 for linking the @entity66 settlement cause with the release of prisoners convicted in connection with killings , mostly of @entity2			1

@entity88 is expected back in the region this week in another effort to breathe life into the negotiations			0
but @entity58 indicated he would not back down			1
' in these negotiations we are faced with our essential interests , including guaranteeing the settlements in the land of @entity2 , ' he said			0
@entity58 's decision to press forward with settlement construction at such a sensitive time has drawn criticism from all directions			1
@entity264 , a cabinet minister with the ' movement ' party , said the painful sight of watching convicted killers walk free could have been avoided had @entity58 agreed to freeze settlement construction			1
protests : hundreds of people marched from the prime minister residence to the @entity4 prisoner 's house victims : portraits of victims of terror seen on a table before a protest @entity280 : people march with portraits of terror victims during the protest in @entity29 , @entity2			1
@entity285 , who served 23 years in @entity2 prison , was one of those expected to be freed last night ' i would have preferred to freeze settlement building rather than releasing prisoners but at this point we must allow this stage to move forward , we must not do anything to prevent it , ' he said			1
settler leader @entity296 , on the other hand , said the timing of a new settlement announcement looked bad			0
' the linkage between the release of convicted terrorists and the construction in @entity29 and in @entity303 and @entity304 puts an unnecessary stain on the construction , ' he said			2
the ' original sin , ' he added , was agreeing to release any prisoners in the first place			2
' @entity2 should have rejected the notion that it has to pay a price for negotiations , ' he said			0
placards : a person holds a sign during a victims of terror attacks protest tribute : a @entity4 relative of @entity320 hangs a poster with his picture in the middle , with pictures of @entity4 president , @entity20 and former president @entity326 the mother of @entity4 prisoner @entity42 kisses her brother as they celebrate ahead of his release relatives of victims of @entity4 attacks awaited a decision from @entity2 's @entity220 on monday in an attempt to prevent the release in another move that could upset peace efforts , a committee of @entity2 cabinet ministers approved a bill sunday that would annex a section of the @entity16 near the @entity344 border to @entity2			1
@entity58 has said @entity2 must maintain a presence in the area , known as the @entity347 , as a security measure			2
even so , it appears unlikely the bill , supported by hard - line lawmakers unhappy with peace efforts , will receive parliamentary approval			0
speaking in @entity22 , @entity20 rejected the move			0
' this is @entity4 land and we will not let them do it , ' he said			0
@entity2 commentators questioned @entity58 's judgment in pushing forward with more settlements			2
' if @entity58 has already undertaken to make this goodwill gesture , it would be best if he were to enjoy the international dividend that comes with it and not ruin things with a populist announcement about new construction , ' wrote @entity365 , a columnist with the @entity366 daily			2
' @entity58 is like a cow that gives a bucket - full of milk , only to kick the bucket over			2
