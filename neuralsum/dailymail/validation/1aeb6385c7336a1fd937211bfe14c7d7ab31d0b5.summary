@entity1 manager @entity0 has experienced the harsh realities of his philosophies being called into question but unlike some critics he has no doubt about the credentials of @entity8 to get things right at @entity10			1
when the pair last met back in december at @entity12 won 3 - 0 , a result which bizarrely actually had more of an effect on the beaten visitors			2
they have not lost in the @entity17 since and , ahead of the clash at @entity19 on sunday , the perception of @entity1 - and @entity0 - has changed completely			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 has lavished praise on opposite number @entity8 ( pictured ) @entity0 has lauded @entity23 ahead of @entity1 's home match against @entity10 @entity10 are currently two points ahead of @entity1 that loss against @entity10 was the last in a run of eight matches which brought just eight points and left @entity1 in 10th place , seven points off fourth			1
however , after taking 33 points from a possible 39 they are just two points behind @entity10 , who occupy the final @entity37 spot			1
@entity10 , by contrast , are still failing to impress in @entity23 's first season in charge despite their league position with many questioning whether he actually knows what his best side is and whether he is getting the best out of the talent he has at his disposal			1
but @entity0 believes that should not reflect badly on the @entity48			1
' i do n't think there is any convincing ( required )			0
he has shown over his career that he is a top - class manager , ' he said			2
' he will have seen , coming into this country for the first time , the challenges of this football - it is why it is the most competitive league in the world			1
' the @entity17 is different from the leagues he will have worked in before but i do n't think you can argue with his credentials			0
@entity23 's @entity10 go into the @entity17 match at @entity19 in fourth position ' there is no question about the philosophies he has put in place at @entity71 or @entity72 or his achievements and when he leaves @entity10 he will still be one of the great managers			1
' @entity0 found himself under similar scrutiny after @entity1 's poor first half of the season but things have turned around and he is flavour of the month once again			1
he admits august to december was a tough period for him , when his methods were being called into question , but believes he has come out the other side stronger for it			2
' i 've said to coaches and players that when the criticism comes , deserved or undeserved , you wo n't like it but you have to accept it as it is part of the game , ' he added			0
' as a manager you have to take the circumstance of where you are at			0
that wo n't fit with results but it is quite easy , you have to stay focused			0
' you have to have an inherent belief of how you work and when it is scrutinised and ridiculed you go back to that platform of why and how you work			0
' you know you are going to get it at some stage and in your career it is important you come out the other side			0
@entity0 , pictured during @entity1 's slender win over @entity109 , insists his side will not be taking @entity10 lightly ' i am early in my career as a manager but that period benefited me			1
' it is the challenges of being a manager at any level , you are scrutinised but you have to stay calm and believe in your qualities as a coach and manager			0
' @entity1 are the top - flight 's form team at the moment but @entity0 will not be taking @entity10 for granted , whatever the critics say about their performances this season			1
' they have a lot of talent and made a lot of investment in world - class players in the summer and they have an outstanding manager , ' he said			2
' they have been up there all season and will want to stay there so we have to stay on the chase but i do n't worry about them clicking			0
' it is an important game			0
these games in particular are always great spectacles and the rivalry is historic			2
' it is at @entity19 against a big rival and we want to win the game			0
i do n't think the result will have an overriding factor ( on the race for the top four ) because there are a number of games to go but psychologically it can give you a great boost			0

@entity0 believes @entity23 is one of football 's ' great managers '
