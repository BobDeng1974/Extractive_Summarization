@entity1 's role in @entity2 has made her extremely popular in the states @entity2 has brought many things for actress @entity1 : worldwide admiration after a long but unsung career in the business , the chance to spend half the year in a £ 2 million home in @entity6 , and a string of rock stars and @entity10 a-listers queuing up to talk to her			1
perhaps the most incongruous is former @entity17 drummer @entity16 , whom she met through their work with the charity @entity21			1
' he came for lunch at my house in @entity6 and i really did n't think we 'd have two words to say to each other because we 're from different ends of the planet , ' says @entity1			1
' he 's a rocker and he 's got more tattoos than @entity31 but he 's gorgeous – and he 's a @entity2 fan			1
so now i 've been to see him play and we 've become friendly			2
how bizarre is that ? ' she laughs			2
it 's thanks to @entity2 's popularity in the @entity37 that @entity1 now spends half her life in @entity6 , where she rents a home in @entity40			1
it 's part work and part play			2
when she 's not out hiking with her husband @entity44 or having lunch with new friends like @entity47 , she 's auditioning for roles – she 's recently had parts in hit shows @entity51 and @entity52			1
@entity2 attracts its fair share of snipers over here , but in @entity37 it 's a different story			1
' they all love the show , ' she says			0
' @entity59 sent me a tweet saying the whole family love it , which was rather sweet			0
and someone told me @entity64 wants to be in it			0
@entity47 first got in touch with me by @entity67 and we 've become friends , and even @entity70 said he 'd like to be in it			2
' but one of my favourite moments came when i met @entity74			0
i was introduced and i told him i 'd met him when i was 16 at the stage door when he was playing @entity76 in @entity77			0
he told me he loved @entity2			1
' in the flesh @entity1 , 61 , looks a decade younger and a hundred times more polished than mrs @entity80			1
when she 's filming @entity2 , which is now shooting its fifth series , she 's not allowed to wear make - up , dye her hair , have a tan or even pluck her eyebrows , so she makes up for it when she takes off mrs @entity80 's apron			1
' on the show , the ickier i look the better , so it 's no surprise i pile the make - up on when i 'm allowed to , ' she laughs			2
' when i met @entity91 [ who plays @entity93 's mother - in - law @entity92 ] in @entity6 she said , " you do n't look like you at all " , because i was all dressed up			2
it does n't half cheer you up			0
' @entity1 says that on @entity2 , the ickier she looks the better it 's all a world away from the shy showbiz novice @entity1 once was			1
she grew up just outside @entity101 ; her mother was an amateur actress while her father was a gp			0
' i was painfully shy as a child , ' she recalls			0
' i never imagined i 'd go into acting but i always loved drama and when i was 16 i discovered the @entity107 up the road			0
so i plucked up courage and asked if i could watch rehearsals			0
then they asked if i wanted a part , and being on stage was like a bolt of lightning			2
so i applied to the @entity120 drama school and i 've been doing it ever since			0
' overcoming her shyness has no doubt been helped by @entity44 , who she married seven years ago			0
they were introduced by a friend who believed he could help her			0
@entity44 , who was born @entity128 but changed his name to @entity44 which means ' black bear ' , specialises in spiritual therapies			0
' the more i got to know him it became clear he was for keeps , ' she says			0
@entity1 with one of the moon bears she has helped to free from the bile farm in @entity138 , @entity139 whilst working with @entity21 ' you know when someone is n't around and you wish they were ? one of the most immediate things was he took over in my kitchen , and i was deeply grateful			1
i 'm not brilliant and he 's a natural cook			0
' which is ironic given the grand concoctions mrs @entity80 produces for the @entity150			0
perhaps the most life - changing aspect of her @entity2 fame , she says , is her work with @entity21 , which campaigns against the cruel practice of @entity139 farmers keeping bears in cramped cages and extracting their bile for use in traditional medicines			1
@entity1 got involved through fellow @entity2 actor @entity162 , who plays @entity163 , the @entity164 of @entity165			1
' @entity162 said these bears get a hook into your heart , and it 's true , ' says @entity1			1
' thanks to @entity2 i got to go to a bear sanctuary			1
even in rural @entity139 people watch the show and were excited to meet me , and that 's a powerful position to be in			0
women of a certain age say to me , " so there 's hope for me yet " , and i tell them , " @entity178 - blimmin - lutely ! " people say you ca n't do this or that because you 're too old , but i 'm proof it 's not true			2
' @entity183 , a gala fundraising evening with @entity1 and @entity162 , thursday , @entity185 , @entity186			1

@entity2 has become a huge hit in the @entity37
this has seen @entity1 shoot to fame and gain many high - *profile* friends
she says the most *rewarding* part of fame is working with @entity21
