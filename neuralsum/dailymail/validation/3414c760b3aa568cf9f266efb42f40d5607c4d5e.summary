co-pilot @entity9 is believed to have deliberately flown the @entity10 into the side of a mountain after locking the captain out of the cockpit , killing himself and all 149 others on board			1
the flight recorder showed that @entity18 repeatedly knocked on the door of the cockpit as the plane began to descend			1
but he resorted to using a crowbar to try and get through the armoured panel as the plane plunged fatally towards the @entity5			1

the captain - named by local media as @entity35 father - of - two @entity18 - then left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter			1
mr @entity25 said : ' we hear the pilot asking the co-pilot to take over and we hear the sound of a chair being pushed back and a door closing so we assume that the captain went to the toilet or something			2
' so the co-pilot is on his own , and it is while he 's on his own that the co-pilot is in charge of the plane and uses the flight management system to start the descent of the plane			1
' at this altitude , this can only be done voluntarily			2
we hear several shouts from the captain asking to get in , speaking through the intercom system , but there 's no answer from the cockpit			0
