a flying car from @entity2 - based firm @entity1 made its first public flight , soaring for 20 minutes in front of aviation enthusiasts in @entity6			1
the transition vehicle is part - sedan , part - private jet and is due to go on sale as early as 2015			1
it was driven around the @entity13 air show in july before transitioning into the jet and taking off on two 20 - minute flight demonstrations			1
it has wings that fold up so it can be driven like a car and can carry luggage			0
the vehicle runs on unleaded petrol the transition can reach speeds of around 70 miles per hour on the road and 115 in the air			1
it flies using a 23 - gallon tank of automotive fuel and burns 5 gallons per hour in the air			1
on the ground , it gets 35 miles per gallon			0
it has rear - wheel drive when on the road			1
the transition comes with two passenger airbags , and a full - vehicle parachute			1
@entity48 's transition has been in development for seven years and during flight testing last year , it successfully flew for eight minutes			1
the @entity48 has two seats , four wheels and wings that fold up so it can be driven like a car			0
it can carry two people , including the pilot , plus luggage and runs on unleaded petrol			0
in a statement , the company said : ' @entity48 made a dream come true at this year 's @entity13			1
' @entity65 performed its first public demonstrations for the aviation community during the show			1
' flown and driven by @entity69 , our chief @entity70 and flight test coordinator , the @entity47 showed the crowd what it 's capable of			1
' the 20 - minute demonstrations included flight manoeuvres over the show centre , converting from airplane to car , and driving along the flight line			1
' transition is considered to be a light sports plane by the @entity83 , as well as being a road car			1
owners will have to have pilot 's licenses , and will need to pass a test , plus complete 20 hours of flying time to be able to fly the car			2
despite the advances in technology the transition demonstrates , critics have said that it is still not the vision of flying cars seen in many sci - fi films			1
to answer these critics , @entity48 also released designs for a @entity101 - @entity100 of its transition range in may			1
the @entity105 model will be small enough to fit in a garage and wo n't need a runway to take off			0
whereas the transition requires a runway , the @entity105 can take off from a vertical position because of motorised rotors on the wings			2
these rotors will work in a similar way to helicopter rotors			0
this shot was taken by a camera fixed to one of the @entity47 's wing during its public flight over @entity6			1
the 20 - minute demonstrations included flight manoeuvres over the show centre , converting from airplane to car , and driving along the flight line the transition flying car , built by @entity48 , making a banking turn in the sky above @entity2			1
the car flew for eight minutes at 1,400 feet during test flights last year , before completing the public flights in @entity6 in july this shot shows the transition plane switching from drive mode to fly mode			2
the wings fold into the side of the car , built from a @entity141 design			0
drivers can only take off in the transition from a runway			2
the transition has a maximum flight speed of 115mph being able to take off from standstill means owners will be able to go from the road to the air straight from their driveways , car parks and even when stuck in traffic			1
although you will still need at least 100 feet in diameter in order to open the wings			0
according to @entity48 , the vehicle will carry four people ' in car - like comfort '			1
it is expected to be able to fly , nonstop , for 500 miles			0
a @entity48 test pilot fills up the transition flying car with petrol			2
the transition can hold 23 gallons of usable fuel and uses 5 gallons per hour during flight			1
on the ground , it gets 35 miles per gallon when the @entity105 - a new flying car design announced by @entity2 - based firm @entity48 - is in drive mode , the wings fold into the side of the car and the rotors , which make it possible to take off in the @entity105 from standing still , also fold away and tuck into the chassis when the wings are folded away , the @entity105 will be small enough to fit in a single - car garage			2
@entity48 announced plans for the @entity105 today and is hoping it will be road - ready in 12 years the @entity105 model has not been tested yet , and prices have n't been announced			2
@entity48 hopes to have working models of the @entity185 available for sale within eight to 12 years			2
like with the transition , pilots will need 20 hours of flying and a pilot 's licence to drive it , though			1
the flying car has always had a special place in the @entity196 imagination			0
inventors have been trying to make them since the 1930s , according to @entity200 , an airline industry analyst who owns @entity201 in @entity202 , @entity203			0
but @entity200 thinks @entity48 has come closer than anyone to making the flying cars a reality			0
the government has already granted the company 's request to use special tires and glass that are lighter than normal automotive ones , to make it easier for the vehicle to fly			2
when its not soaring in the air , the @entity47 's wings fold up , pictured , to make it a road - ready two - seat car special rules : the federal government has eased certain regulations to allow vehicles like the transition to come closer to reality the government has also temporarily exempted the transition from the requirement to equip vehicles with electronic stability control , which would add about six pounds to the vehicle			1
@entity200 said @entity48 was helped by the @entity83 's decision five years ago to create a separate set of standards for light sport aircraft			0
the standards govern the size and speed of the plane and licensing requirements for pilots , which are less restrictive than requirements for pilots of larger planes			0
inventors and engineers have been working on the flying car concept since the 1930s			0
here , a 1947 @entity246 is seen in flight unholy alliance : the 1973 @entity249 attached a @entity251 airframe to a @entity252			2
its inventor was killed when the wings collapsed during a test flight the 1930s @entity256 , pictured , was the first simple flying car to successfully be produced			2
a total of five were built and flown @entity200 questions the size of the market for the transition			0
the general aviation market has been in decline for two decades , he said , largely because of fuel costs and the high cost of liability for manufacturers			0
also , fewer people are learning how to fly			0
' this is not going to be an inexpensive aircraft to produce or market , ' he said			0
' it has some uniqueness , and will get some sales , but the question is , could it ever be a profitable enterprise ? ' @entity200 sees the western @entity196 as the most likely market , where people could fly instead of driving long distances			0
@entity48 has been working on flying cars since 2006 , and has already pushed back the launch once			0
last summer the company said it would have to delay expected 2011 deliveries due to design challenges and problems with parts suppliers .			0

the *Â£* *190,000* ( *$* *300,00* ) transition is part - sedan , part - private jet
it made two 20 - minute flight demonstrations at the @entity13 show
the @entity47 vehicle is due to go on sale in 2015
