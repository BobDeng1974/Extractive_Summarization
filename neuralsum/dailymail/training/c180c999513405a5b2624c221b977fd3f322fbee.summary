tens of thousands of @entity3 patients are having operations to clear their arteries in the false belief that it will cut their chance of a heart attack or even extend their life , a leading expert has warned			1
doctors are failing to tell patients that angioplasty is not a magic bullet to stop heart attacks , said consultant cardiologist @entity17			1
each year some 30,000 people with a condition called stable angina opt to have the procedure , in which a tiny balloon is inserted into clogged arteries to help clear them			2
tens of thousands of @entity3 patients are having operations to clear their arteries in the false belief that it will cut their chance of a heart attack or extend their life , according to leading expert @entity17 ( file picture ) a metal ring called a stent is then put in to keep the artery wide			1
the theory is that widening the artery will improve blood flow and reduce the odds of a blockage			0
but dr @entity17 said such patients were rarely told that the invasive procedure made no difference to their chance of having a heart attack , nor did it improve their odds of long life			1
he said : ‘ patients often have this treatment believing it will save them from a heart attack or prolong their life			2
but there is no convincing scientific evidence that this is true			0
‘ cardiologists who stent patients with stable angina are frequently not giving this information to patients			0
’ dr @entity17 said patients were rarely told that the invasive procedure made no difference to their chance of having a heart attack patients with stable angina experience chest pain , caused by restricted blood flow , brought on by a trigger , such as exercise or stress			1
dr @entity17 cited a @entity67 study that found nine in ten patients with stable angina wrongly believed that angioplasty would cut their chance of a heart attack			1
the operation is also used as an emergency procedure to help maintain blood flow in patients who have suffered a heart attack			1
about 60,000 patients a year receive angioplasty in these circumstances			0
dr @entity17 emphasised there was good evidence to show it helped save the lives of such patients			2
he also said angioplasty could help reduce the frequency and severity of chest pain in those with stable angina			0
but he said patients with stable angina should be given all the information before making a decision on surgery			0
and he said they should be told that leading a healthy lifestyle and taking drugs such as statins could cut the chance of a heart attack			1
‘ doctors should give them all the information before subjecting them to treatment , ’ he added			0
his comments were backed up by @entity102 ’s heart disease ‘ tsar ’ , professor @entity103			0
he said : ‘ there is no evidence that coronary angioplasty reduces risk of heart attack or death in patients with uncomplicated stable angina , and it is important that doctors are clear with their patients about this			2

they are under false belief it will cut chance of heart attack , expert claims
