by @entity0 a pioneering stem cell procedure to repair fractured bones could provide a lifeline for accident victims facing the amputation of a limb			1
the development involves harvesting stem cells – ‘ master ’ cells that are able to transform into any kind of body tissue – from the patient ’s pelvis , blending them with a specially created gel and injecting the solution into the damaged bone			1
one patient already benefiting is lifelong motorcycle enthusiast @entity20 who suffered horrific injuries to his left leg when his @entity23 was rammed by a car in 2011			1
on yer bike : @entity20 , 57 , pictured with his ' saviour ' professor @entity28 at @entity30 s @entity29 , can now ride his bike again after undergoing the new stem cell procedure he suffered multiple open fractures , leaving bone protruding through the skin , and extensive skin loss			1
doctors repeatedly told him his leg would have to be amputated			2
today , though , @entity20 , 57 , is back on his feet – and , astonishingly , also his bike – thanks to the ground - breaking stem - cell treatment			1
he says : ‘ i may never dance the tango , but , thanks to professor @entity28 , i will be able to get as near to normal as possible			0
’ there are 350,000 serious fractures admitted to hospitals in the @entity48 every year			0
five to ten per cent fail to heal , leading to multiple operations , bone - grafting and , if these treatments fail , potentially amputation			2
previously , the lack of blood and dna in fractured bone has meant newly introduced cells had no way of ‘ signalling ’ the damaged cells to regenerate			1
the new treatment overcomes this obstacle , with the gel ’s ingredients ‘ telling ’ the old cells to grow again			1
the operation , performed under a general anaesthetic , takes only 30 minutes and the patient can walk and go home on the same day			0
to date , it has been carried out successfully on six patients in the @entity48 , four in @entity71 and 20 in @entity72			0
‘ experiments have shown that collagen can trigger the transformation of stem cells into bone forming cells , ’ says professor @entity28 , deputy director of @entity73 at @entity30 ’s @entity29			1
‘ these “ miracle ” cells are abundant in bone marrow , so may be harvested , concentrated and applied with a collagen ‘ scaffold ’ into an area of poor healing			1
’ bone marrow is drawn from the patient ’s pelvis using a hollow needle			2
this marrow contains a mixture of stem cells , red blood cells and blood - forming cells			1
the stems cells in the suspension are separated from the others in a centrifuge			2
the now - concentrated bone marrow stem cell suspension is mixed with collagen and the mixture is ready for implantation by injection			1
the surgeon stabilises the fracture , sometimes with a long metal rod through the medullary canal – the hollow inside of the bone			2
a small incision at the knee allows access to the top of the tibia			0
the stem cell and collagen suspension is then injected into the fracture site and around the bone , guided by x-ray			1
following surgery the patient is allowed to partially weight - bear , and progressively increase the load he applies through his leg			2
to date , prof @entity28 ’s pioneering procedure results in half the healing time associated with traditional treatment and , at £ 2,000 to £ 3,000 , costs a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of pounds usually involved in amputation , rehabilitation and prosthetics			2
professor @entity138 , president elect of the @entity133 and one of the world ’s leading authorities on stem cell treatment , has welcomed prof @entity28 ’s work , saying : ‘ it will revolutionise the whole field of bone fracture repairs			1
‘ the patient has a more effective treatment and the health provider saves money			0
‘ it ’s a win - win situation			0
’ in the 18 months after his accident , @entity20 , a high - altitude window cleaner from @entity151 , @entity30 , had a cage screwed to his damaged leg , three bone grafts and a raft of other procedures			1
as a result of the accident ( for which the driver of the car was successfully prosecuted ) and the medication prescribed , he lost his job , his girlfriend and most of his money			0
at one stage he contemplated suicide			0
at his wits ’ end , @entity20 – who had never been admitted to hospital in his life – turned to the internet and typed in the search box ‘ i want to save my leg ’			1
he came across prof @entity28 ’s name , and says he is still in a state of disbelief over the reversal in his fortunes since having the operation in 2012			0
‘ six hours after the operation , professor @entity28 told me to get up and go for a walk , ’ he says			0
‘ after being in and out of hospitals , i really could n’t believe it			0
‘ i ’d suffered 15 months of being told there was a good chance i was going to lose my leg , yet eight weeks after the procedure i was told to start putting weight on it and to walk as much as i could			2
‘ it still hurts to walk long distances , but that will improve			0
‘ my foot is turned out a little bit to the side and i have a limp , but that ’s a small price to pay to keep my leg			0
‘ my hope is this procedure will eventually be available to everyone , since it can help so many people , particularly the military			0
‘ the old way of mending broken bones is so painful and stops you getting on with your life			0
‘ professor @entity28 ’s stem cell surgery is quick and almost painless , so it ’s important more people hear about it			1

@entity20 , 57 , injured his leg in a motorcycle accident in 2011
thanks to a new stem cell procedure , he can now ride his bike again
