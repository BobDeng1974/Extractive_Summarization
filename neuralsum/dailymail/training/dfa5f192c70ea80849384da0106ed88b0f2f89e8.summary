by @entity0 for @entity1 a @entity3 businessman has raised thousands of pounds to rescue a neglected tiger from a zoo in @entity6			1
@entity7 , who runs a bookshop in @entity9 , @entity10 , has almost raised the £ 11,500 needed to save the 485lb tiger , called @entity12 , from the cash - strapped zoo in the town of @entity16			1
@entity12 , who is 15 years old , has been alone in his enclosure since march , when his long - time companion @entity19 died after an infected wound on her paw went untreated			1
earlier this year his long - time partner , @entity19 , died after an infected wound on her paw went untreated the tiger was rescued from a travelling @entity25 circus by the @entity6 authorities in 2001 , and was taken to @entity16 zoo , in the north - west of the country			1
however , following the financial crisis , the condition of the zoo has deteriorated , leaving @entity12 alone and in a ' poor ' enclosure			2
since then @entity7 , who used to work for the @entity39 in @entity6 and has re-homed dozens of exotic animals in the past 20 years , has been trying to find a new home for the tiger			2
after months of fundraising , mr @entity7 , 62 , has managed to get the money together to move @entity12 to a sanctuary near @entity46 , @entity47			1
he said : ' when @entity12 and @entity19 arrived at the zoo , the enclosure was not very good and i persuaded them to build a new one and things were going well			2
' then ... the financial crisis hit @entity6 and after that things changed			0
' former @entity56 inspector @entity7 , who runs a bookshop in @entity10 , has raised nearly £ 11,500 - enough to move @entity12 from the @entity6 zoo to an enclosure in @entity46 , @entity47 former @entity56 inspector mr @entity7 lost track of the situation after having to undergo his second heart bypass operation			1
he added : ' i got a phone call saying i should go and see @entity19 who was bleeding from a wound in her paw which had become infected			0
' mr @entity7 swung into action and set up a fundraising website to spare @entity12 a similar fate by raising £ 11,500 to transfer him to a sanctuary for lions , tigers and bears near @entity46 , in @entity47			1
he added : ' @entity12 is still in @entity6 but he is being checked on frequently by a vet friend and so far he is ok			2
' i have raised just over £ 10,400 so just £ 1,100 to go			0
whatever i 'm short of will go on my credit card			0
' he is now awaiting the paperwork to allow @entity12 to be flown to @entity47 via @entity82 , in @entity83			0
he added : ' i started applying to carry out the move in april and i 'm hoping to go next month			0
it 's the biggest and most challenging thing i 've done			0
' i will stay with him throughout the trip , he knows me very well , i am able to feed him and stroke him in his enclosure			0
' i want him to go soon and start his new life , i know he 'll be in good hands as the sanctuary he 's going to was recommended to me by a vet			0
' there 's a 16 - year - old female in the enclosure next to him where he 's going , i hope they might get to like each other			2
' mr @entity7 , who has a 23 - year - old @entity6 cat , @entity103 , which he calls his ' own little tiger , ' said he was very grateful to everyone who responded to the appeal and helping with his mission to re-home @entity12			1
