worrying : criticism of the state pension in @entity2 has come at a time when the age of qualification is likely to rise along with the life expectancy of citizens state pensions in @entity2 are the worst in any major @entity11 economy , a report has revealed			1
even former @entity13 nations such as @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 are among those where provision is more generous as a proportion of average incomes , according to the @entity21			1
a total of 12.3million people in @entity2 have reached the state pension age – between 61 and 68 – and are entitled to a maximum payout of £ 110.15			1
the @entity26 , which will lobby mps today for a better deal , says a decent ‘ living state pension ’ would be £ 178 a week			1
the @entity21 also said yesterday that babies born in @entity2 this year will ‘ probably ’ be 70 before they can claim a state pension			1
at present , a man can start claiming his state pension from the age of 65 and a woman can start to claim her pension from the age of 61 and nine months			2
both state pension ages are being increased			2
by 2018 , it will be 65 for women as well as men , and will then keep on rising for them both to 66 in 2020 , 67 by 2028 and will keep on going up			0
@entity44 , a director of the @entity21 , pointed out that many babies born this year will also live to celebrate their 100th birthday which means their retirement will last for least 30 years			0
a baby girl born this year has a one in 2.5 chance of living to 100 , while a baby boy has just under a one in three chance , according to the @entity52			0
if the state pension age was not increased , it would raise the prospect of a cripplingly expensive state pension system in which people retired at 65 but survived for several more decades			2
overall , the @entity21 ’s research , published yesterday , looks at the ‘ replacement rate ’ - that is the percentage of their final salary that is ‘ replaced ’ by their state pension			1
in @entity2 , it is typically only 32.6 per cent for an average earner , compared with an average across the @entity21 ’s 34 countries of 40.6 per cent			2
the @entity21 's research looks at the ' replacement rate ' - the percentage of an earner 's final salary replaced by their state pension pressure : the @entity26 , which will lobby mps today for a better deal , says a decent ' living state pension ' would be £ 178 a week , almost £ 70 short of the current maximum weekly payment it is far higher in other countries than it is in this country			1
for example , it is 42 per cent in @entity83 , 58.8 per cent in @entity84 , 45.7 per cent in @entity85 and as high as 76.6 per cent in @entity86			0
in the @entity16 the figure is 67.9 per cent , in @entity15 73.6 per cent and in @entity14 40.6 per cent - all higher than in the @entity2			1
mr @entity44 raised his concerns about the future facing young people as governments put pressure on people to save for themselves , rather than rely on the @entity94 to fund their retirement			0
he said : ‘ i am very concerned that we are moving towards a more contribution - based system but in many countries especially young people have been unemployed			0
‘ they are outside the labour market so they are not contributing ( into a pension )			0
‘ we hope the economy will kick on and then many of them will indeed get into a job and so on and so forth			0
repost : @entity106 , the @entity107 , above , defended the changes to the pensions system , saying : ' we are building a @entity2 pension system that is more sustainable for the future ' ‘ but they will have fewer years of contribution so potentially there is also a long - term effect of the current crisis which in some countries has been particularly severe , especially for the young generation			1
’ nearly one million people in @entity2 between the age of 16 and 24 are currently unemployed , according to official figures from the @entity122			2
young people aged 22 and over are currently being signed up to a pension scheme by their boss if they earn more than £ 9,440			2
but they must , obviously , have a job in order to qualify			0
under the standard @entity21 economic assumptions , full career workers would expect a significant increase in their replacement rates , assuming a contribution level of eight per cent of their income			0
average earners are estimated to reach a 55.4 per cent replacement rate , with low earners at 76.2 per cent and high earners at 48.4 per cent , bringing the @entity2 much closer to the @entity21 average			2
@entity138 , general secretary of the @entity26 ’ convention , highlighted the nightmare facing today ’s pensioners surviving on such a paltry pension payout			0
the @entity21 looked at the future facing young people joining the labour market today , working hard and examined the sort of pension that they can expect to receive			0
she said : ‘ older people are facing a daily struggle with rising costs of living , inadequate pensions and cuts to services they need such as day care centres , social care and bus services			0
‘ the @entity2 economy can still afford to give all older people certain basic rights in retirement such as a living state pension , dignified care and an end to loneliness and fuel poverty			1
’ @entity106 , the @entity107 , said : ‘ we are building a @entity2 pension system that is more sustainable for the future			1
‘ as the @entity21 recognises , by combining the state pension and income from workplace pensions people many people in @entity2 can expect an adequate retirement income			1

pensioners in the @entity2 are entitled to a maximum of £ 110.15 per - week
report says that is almost £ 70 below what is a ' living state pension '
@entity184 such as @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 offer more generous deals
salary replaced by @entity2 pension is 32.6 **%** , compared to 67.9 **%** in @entity16
