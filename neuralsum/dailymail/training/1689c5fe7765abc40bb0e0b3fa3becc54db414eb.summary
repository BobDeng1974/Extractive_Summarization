‘ three weeks prior to our departure we emailed the @entity17 to confirm our airport pick up and a few other details			0
‘ as a result of our email to @entity19 and a call to our booking agent we finally learned that the hotel had simply cancelled our reservation and , i assume , those of many others			2
