a grieving mother has defended her heartbreaking decision to spend thousands of pounds on presents for her baby , despite the fact he died before birth			2
@entity7 , 34 , says shopping for gifts for her son helps her cope with her loss and pay tribute to @entity13 , who died aged 32 weeks in june , 2012			1
but her decision to post images of what would have been her son 's nursery crammed with gifts and toys has led to her being abused online			2
@entity7 , 34 , says shopping for gifts for her baby son @entity13 helps her cope with her loss @entity7 has now decided to speak out about her experience to make people understand why she enjoys buying toys for her son			1
she said : ' buying presents for @entity13 helps me cope with my loss , so who has the right to judge or attack me for that ? ' i 'm sick of people 's cruel comments about me			1
i 've been through enough already without receiving vile messages from strangers			2
' she continued : ' buying toys for him is my way of feeling close to him			2
' there are so many things that he never got to do and i never got to do for him , so this small act helps me - we all cope in different ways			1
' if it offends people , they should n't look			2
if placing toys in his room gives me the strength to carry on , who has got the right to tell me to stop ? ' @entity7 cradles her baby son @entity13 , who died in the womb eight weeks before her due date miss @entity7 was 31 when she finally conceived with her partner after convincing herself she might never be able to fall pregnant			1
she explained : ' i 'd had a long term relationship in the past and we had tried unsuccessfully for many years with no joy			2
' so she was ecstatic when her dream came true and at 20 weeks , she learned she was carrying a son			1
she said : ' i had always loved the name @entity13 and told anyone who would listen that i could n't wait to spoil him rotten after waiting for so long to have him			1
' the only time @entity7 felt any peace was in @entity13 's nursery , surrounded by all his things miss @entity7 , a former office worker from @entity72 , @entity73 , decorated the nursery and awaited her son 's arrival			1
but at 32 weeks a routine scan failed to pick up a heartbeat			1
she said : ' he was due in eight weeks			1
i kept saying there must be a mistake and praying they were wrong			0
i just could not believe what was happening			0
' but consultants confirmed @entity13 had died and @entity85 was to be induced			1
after a 12 - hour labour , her baby was born and @entity85 recalled desperately hoping to hear a cry			1
back home she planned her son 's funeral and the night before it took place , she brought him home			0
she said : ' it gave me a tiny comfort to have him home , just for one night			0
it meant that he was in the nursery i had prepared for him			0
' the stress of @entity13 's death led to @entity7 's split with her partner , making her spend more time in the nursery buying toys for @entity13 is @entity7 's way of saying , ' you are gone but i am still thinking of you , ' she said over the coming months she was engulfed by depression and despair as she struggled to come to terms with her loss			1
she said : ' the only time i felt any peace at all was sitting in his nursery among all his things - the clothes and toys i had bought for him when he was alive			2
' a postmortem found that her placenta had stopped working and @entity13 had not been growing , but did not confirm why			1
the stress of the death lead her to split with her partner and miss @entity7 says she started to spend even more time in her son 's nursery			1
then one day , she decided to buy a few more toys			0

@entity7 says her methods of coping with the death of her baby son help give her the strength to carry on @entity7 survived her first @entity133 after @entity13 's stillbirth by buying a present and taking it to his grave ' i went shopping and picked up a few bits and for those few hours i felt some peace and then joy when i took them home and placed them on his shelf			1
' it was just my way of saying to him ' you are gone but i am still thinking of you			0
' six months later , the first @entity133 she had been dreading arrived and @entity85 said spending £ 200 on a remote control toy and cuddly characters eased her pain			0
she said : ' i took them to his grave to show him			0
it got me through the day , so i was grateful			0
' she now runs half marathons to raise money for neonatal death charity sands @entity7 's family and close friends supported her decision but others failed to understand			1
a year after the birth , she decided to arrange a ' birthday party ' to mark @entity13 's anniversary			1
she booked a bouncy castle and invited family and friends who also brought presents for @entity13			1
miss @entity7 said : ' i was so moved that people understood and it turned what could have been the most horrific day into a happy one			1
how can anyone say this is wrong ? ' but several people started to make nasty comments after @entity85 began posting images of her son 's toys online			0
she reveals that she has been labelled a freak and a weirdo and told to ' forget and move on '			0
she said : ' it 's heartbreaking because people do n't have to look			0
' why should n't i do something that makes that pain just a little easier			0
' the former factory worker , who runs half marathons to raise money for neonatal death charity sands , has not been able to work since losing her son and pays for his gifts using money saved from her benefits			2
this year , she spent £ 300 on toys and a bike for @entity133 – her third without him			2
she said : ' i will never get the chance to do all the things i wanted to do for @entity13			1
this is the only way i can express my love			0
' i hope that one day i will feel strong enough to donate all of his wonderful toys to charity			0
' i love the idea of other children getting pleasure from the things i have bought for @entity13			1
but until then they will stay in his room			0
' i wish he was there too but nothing can change that			0
' all i can do is continue in the way i have found that makes life easier and if you do n't want to try and least to understand then please just look the other way instead of posting nasty messages			0
' i just hope the people that are ridiculing me never have to understand what it feels like to lose a much wanted baby			0
