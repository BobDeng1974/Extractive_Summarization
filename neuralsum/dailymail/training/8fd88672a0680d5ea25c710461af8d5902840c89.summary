@entity0 , known as the first train murderer , was hanged for the killing of @entity3 in 1864 it was the story that gripped the nation : a well - to - banker bludgeoned to death in a first - class train carriage on his way home from work			1
the suspect then fled abroad and , in what must be the slowest police chase ever , a @entity13 detective chased him by boat across the @entity18 before he could make his arrest			1
such was the interest in the murder of 70 - year - old @entity3 on the 9.45pm train from @entity24 to @entity25 on 9 july 1864 , it even knocked the @entity26 off the front pages			1
the first sign of the crime was when two young men walked into the empty carriage and sat down to discover the seats and walls were drenched in blood			0
there was a bloodied handprint on the window , and ladies in the carriages beyond complained that tiny droplets of blood had come flying through the open window , flecking their dresses			0
but there was no sign of the victim			0
a couple of hours later a man was found , barely alive , beside the tracks near @entity50			0
@entity3 , a respectable @entity51 banker and father of four , was missing his left ear , his gold watch , and his top hat , and he died soon after from his injuries			1
he was the first person to be murdered on a train - and @entity58 was scandalised			2
if such a murder - the subject of a new @entity63 documentary to be broadast next week - could happen in first - class , then anyone could ' be slain in our pew at church ' , raged one newspaper , also suggesting readers might now expect to be ' assassinated at our dinner table '			0
historian @entity71 , whose book mr @entity3 ' hat : a sensational account of @entity75 's @entity74 , tells the story of the killing , says the effect of the murder on the nation was similar to that of the terrorist attacks in @entity83 and @entity84			1
a @entity86 drawing of banker @entity3 and the hunt to find his killer after he was murdered on a train ' there was this great sense of " we thought we were safe " , and everyone was stunned to realise that actually , they were n't , ' she told @entity96			1
' @entity3 was white , middle - class , respectable , and in a first - class carriage			1
if he could be murdered , there , then no - one was safe - any of us could be plunged into this new kind of hell			0
' the @entity75 public , so proud of their newly - industrialised nation and its railways , became gripped by the mystery surrounding the killer			0
in the carriage , police found a hat that mr @entity3 ' family insisted was not his , and detective @entity113 decided that if he could find out who it belonged to , he would find the murderer			1
@entity117 : @entity13 's @entity113 , played by @entity118 in the @entity63 's new documentary a reward of Â£ 300 , equivalent to several years ' wages , was offered for information , and a cabbie came forward to say he knew the hat belonged to a @entity126 immigrant tailor called @entity0			1
@entity0 's landlady in the @entity128 said she had seen him wearing a new watch that matched the victim 's , and police followed the trail to @entity83 docks , where @entity0 had boarded a wooden sailing ship bound for @entity84 within a week of the murder			1
detective @entity113 took the train to @entity138 and got on a faster steamer bound for @entity84 , arriving three weeks before his target			2
the train 's cabman @entity141 , played by @entity143 in the @entity63 documentary a train driver on the @entity148 , @entity145 ( played by @entity146 ) discovered @entity150 's body by the track he had to keep his head down in @entity153 , where the @entity26 was raging and @entity154 were not welcome			2
ms @entity71 said : ' people in @entity84 knew that @entity113 was there waiting for @entity0 's ship , and they turned out to greet every ship arriving from @entity83 in case @entity0 was on it			1
' it was not an easy place for @entity113 to be			0
' author @entity71 but with a fevered @entity75 public back home waiting eagerly for news of an arrest , @entity113 was determined to get his man			2
when finally @entity0 's ship came in , @entity113 confronted him and found he had both @entity3 ' watch and a silk top matching the victim 's			1
but the suspect 's mild manner confused the detective			0
ms @entity71 said : ' when he was arrested he seemed surprised , and the ship 's captain remarked how he read @entity174 appreciatively on the journey to @entity153			0
' a baying mob waited for @entity0 in @entity83 , but at his trial at the @entity179 , his manner continued to confound those expecting to see a brutal killer			1
the short , young foreigner barely spoke in court , and blushed when he was offered a chair to sit on in the dock			0
no murder weapon was found , but @entity0 was found guilty and wept in court as the verdict was announced			1
four months later , he was hanged at @entity189 in front of a bloodthirsty crowd			1
@entity192 plays @entity193 , a journalist covering the murder case that gripped @entity58 @entity141 , played by @entity143 , pictured , was the cabman on the train where banker @entity3 was murdered ms @entity71 said : ' the crowd at his hanging was enormous : there were 40,000 people packed into the small , narrow streets around @entity189 and the @entity179			1
' people were drunk , they were swearing - it was the biggest and noisiest crowd at a public hanging in living memory			0
' @entity0 cut a dignified figure as he made his way to the scaffold , and - according to his priest and confessor - made a last - minute confession to him , saying ' ich habe es getan ' ( i did it ) moments before he swung			2
such was the size and behaviour of the crowd that it led directly to the banning of public hangings - a few years later , popular disgust at public hangings meant that they were moved behind prison walls			0
historian ms @entity71 said that despite the convicted killer being hanged , the @entity86 public never felt they got the full story behind the bloody killing			2
' my feeling is that @entity0 did it , but that he did n't set out to murder , ' she said			2
' perhaps it was a robbery that went wrong , and he did not think that he had killed @entity3			2
' that would account for his surprise when he was arrested			0
' it was a prickly story for a hugely interested @entity75 public , and although they felt they had got their man , they never quite felt they got to the bottom of it			0
' murder on the @entity246 is on @entity63 next thursday at 9pm .			0
