@entity1 ’s conviction was jeopardised by his secret arrest and draconian threats to newspapers from lawyers citing the @entity6			1
the legal bullying meant the @entity8 did not name the paedophile predator until four months after he was first quizzed by detectives			0
when the news blackout ended , a flood of other victims went to the police to back up the first woman ’s claims			1
open justice campaigners say the case shows that suppressing suspects ’ names – even after arrest – can help protect criminals			2
detectives interviewed @entity1 in november 2012 but refused to confirm rumours that they had done so			1
police forces would usually confirm or deny a suspect had been arrested or interviewed under caution if asked by journalists			1
veteran entertainer @entity1 leaves @entity38 , with his wife @entity39 and daughter @entity39 ( right ) , after being found guilty of 12 sex charges involving four women but following the @entity6 , which included a raft of proposals to rein in the @entity46 , there have been growing concerns that police and other officials have been able to withhold key information from the public			1
newspapers continued to hold off from naming @entity1 even after he was quizzed by officers for a second time in march 2013			2
in his report , @entity55 wrote that except in exceptional circumstances the names of those who are arrested should not be released to the press or the public his lawyers used the @entity6 , which recommended anonymity in the event of arrests , to intimidate the press into silence			0
but newspapers finally did publish his name the following month and more than a dozen victims came forward , nine of whom testified at his trial			0
prosecutor @entity73 told the trial this evidence was crucial in proving the case against @entity1 by demonstrating his ‘ persistent pattern of sexual offending ’			1

it means nobody else can come forward			0
it is protecting the perpetrators not the victims			0
’ @entity115 , a @entity115 mp on the @entity117 culture committee , said : ‘ the @entity1 case is another prime example of why it is so important to have an open system of justice where people are informed about who ’s been arrested or charged			1
