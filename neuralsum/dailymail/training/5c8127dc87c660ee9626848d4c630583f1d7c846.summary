a woman who gained three stone while serving as an officer in the @entity3 has shed the extra weight in time for her perfect wedding			1
@entity6 , 32 , from @entity7 , found it a struggle to keep off the weight due to the lively social life and drinking culture that comes with being a sailor			2
even an active tour of duty in @entity16 failed to do the trick and she continued to pile on the pounds			1
even a tour of @entity16 failed to shift weight			1
but a fear of looking fat at her wedding helped her drop five dress sizes ( right )			1
' when the opportunity to go to @entity16 came up , i jumped at the chance ' said @entity6 adding that she had actually expected to lose weight			1
' after all , six and a half months in a war zone where you ca n't drink and going to the gym was your only form of social interaction , you 're bound to come back ' body beautiful ' right ? ' however , @entity6 found that the boozy social life of the @entity3 left her piling on the pounds			1
' the lifestyle in the @entity3 is a party lifestyle - drinking was massive ; drinking and unhealthy food			1
' it was n't until @entity6 was shopping for her wedding dress and was forced to settle on a 18 gown that she decided drastic action had to be taken			1
@entity6 decided to start dieting a year ago and was able to drop five dress sizes in time for her wedding last summer she joined @entity50 and slimmed down to a size eight bride for her nuptials last summer to husband @entity54			1
although you need to be fit to be in the @entity3 , @entity6 says that there is no need to be slim and her career left her at a curvy size 18 @entity6 , who is planning to leave the @entity3 in april after 14 years to become a beautician , said her weight would fluctuate from 11 to 13 stone , but claims this is n't uncommon among naval officers			1
she said : ' it 's the lifestyle in the @entity3			1
there are two chefs on board so you get your five - a - day but there 's always unhealthy food around			0
she continued : ' you 've got to be fit in the @entity3 but you do n't have to be slim			2
' the yo - yo dieter did lose weight during her six months in @entity16 , and became engaged to @entity54 on her return , but she had piled it back on by november last year and had to settle on picking out a size 18 wedding dress			2
she transformed her diet , replacing junk food and snacks with lean meats and plenty of vegetables			0
@entity6 , who has tried numerous fad diets , says that the healthy eating plan was the only diet she has had success at - and the only one @entity54 , a scaffolder and also a qualified personal trainer , has approved of			2
she said : ' we used to do two separate meals but now there 's one for the two of us			0
' it 's such a big difference to have that time and just sit down at the dining room table at the end of the day and have the same thing			0
' she continued : ' the diet has been really easy to do - i felt i was eating more and getting better results			0
' by may , when she received a phone call letting her know that her wedding dress was in , she was around 10 stone - but had failed to tell the shop about her dramatic loss			2
staff at the dress shop were stunned at the difference and had quite a job on their hands to re-shape the gown			0
@entity6 said : ' it was slipping off			0
they had to pin it all the way down and there were huge flaps down the sides where they had to pin it too			0
' they almost took the dress apart and put it back together again			0
' having dropped a total of 2st 13lb to hit her target weight of 9st 1lb , her new look was revealed to most of her family and friends for the first time at her july wedding			0
@entity6 is now keen to inspire others to shift the extra pounds she said : ' i was really excited because i wanted natural pictures taken but in the past i was always having to hold myself in and lift my head up			2
' when i saw the pictures there were so many that had been taken when i did n't even know the photographer was there - and i 'm smiling and natural looking			0
' and now , a year on from the day she joined the weight - loss club , she 's hoping to inspire others by launching her very own @entity143 in her hometown @entity6 is will be holding her first classes on january 1 and 2 , exactly 365 days after she took the plunge herself .			0

the @entity3 lifestyle of boozy *nights* out saw @entity6 gain three stone
even a tour of @entity16 failed to keep off the pounds for long
a fear of looking fat at her wedding finally forced her to go on a diet
