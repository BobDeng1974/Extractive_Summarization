these beautiful images may look like something from an alien world - but they were actually created using a special type of infrared film , which one photographer has started stockpiling due to its increased rarity			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 , began experimenting with infrared photography when he was in @entity11 , five years ago			2
having originally shot infrared images through digital camera , @entity8 decided to try and take similar shots with infrared film rolls , which he said was a far more difficult task			2
@entity17 : rowers paddle around the lake in @entity20 , oblivious to the stunning shades of blue and red only visible in infrared exposure : the dark metal statue of @entity27 poet @entity26 is overpowered by the brilliant red of the leaves as seen in the infrared spectrum contrast : the verdant foliage of a @entity34 valley becomes a vibrant crimson while the monumental : the breathtaking landscape to @entity34 's mountains as it has never been seen before with most people now using digital cameras , the likes of @entity39 discontinued their infrared film range around six years ago			1
infrared film is extremely tricky to work with , as there is very little latitude between highlights and shadows before images become over exposed			0
humans see what 's known as ' visible light ' - a part of the electromagnetic spectrum that can be seen by the eye			0
beyond this range there are other waves that are not visible to humans - infrared film is engineered to be responsive not only to what humans can see , but also what can not be seen , capturing infrared rays from certain materials , such as foliage			0
intensity : the use of rare infrared @entity39 film enables the photographer to produce images , such of this in @entity20 , @entity9 , which appear more like paintings colourful : few visitors , of the human kind , will have seen these shades of colours during a walk through @entity20 in @entity9 in bloom : spring time in @entity9 gives photographer @entity8 the chance of capturing the city in all its peculiar colour mr @entity8 said : ' the thing i find most fascinating about infrared photography is its ability to transform something real to something surreal , without looking altered			1
' i ca n't tell you how many people have asked me , ' was it really that red ? ' ' getting the perfect shot with infrared film requires a bit of trial and error - taking a series of shots at various exposure settings in the hope that one of them gets it right , as , since it 's film , you ca n't immediately see if you were on the spot with your settings			0
new insight : photographer @entity8 uses special infrared detecting rolls of film which picks up light not visible to the human eye here in @entity20 , @entity9 tickled pink : grass in @entity20 , @entity9 , appears a vivid shade of red in these bizarre photographs using the infrared light range ' with many infrared films now discontinued , to the dislike of my wife , my entire freezer is filled with hard to find @entity39 films , most notably @entity125 , @entity126 , and @entity127			1
' i have seen prices range up to $ 150 for a roll on the web			0
the issue is not so much the price - although steep - but the availability , as infrared films were gobbled up and stockpiled upon word of discontinuation			0
testing : using infrared film presents the photographer will the added difficulty of trying to judge the amount of exposure when viewing contrasted landscapes such as this view over a lake in @entity20 , @entity9 stunning : @entity144 in @entity9 looks even more majestic under the cobalt sky and next to the vermilion trees			1

artist @entity8 uses special discontinued @entity39 film which works in the *invisible* infrared wave *length*
*unusual* *technique* gives green foliage a vibrant vermilion *hue* and the sky a deep cobalt intensity
