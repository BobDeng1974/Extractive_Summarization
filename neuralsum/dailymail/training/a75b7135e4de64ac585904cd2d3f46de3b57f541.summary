these adorable baby twins born 14 weeks early have finally been reunited after being separated for five months while one struggled for life in the hospital			2
@entity3 and @entity4 were both born weighing just 1lb 14oz and for a while it was touch and go as to whether they would survive			1
@entity4 was released from hospital in october but @entity3 suffered from breathing problems and remained apart from her twin until she too was allowed home this week			1
together again : @entity3 and @entity4 have been reunited after spending five months apart following their premature birth			1
while @entity4 went home , @entity3 had to stay for treatment little fighters : mother @entity16 , from @entity17 , @entity18 , cradling her twin girls while they were separated mother @entity16 , 28 , tenderly placed a teddy bear wearing @entity4 ’s clothes in @entity3 ’s incubator so that she would feel as though her sister was close			1
now , after months of waiting , the family , including dad @entity27 , 26 , a technician , and three - year - old brother @entity29 , are all settled back at their home in @entity17 , @entity18			2
mrs @entity4 , a paediatric staff nurse , said : ' @entity3 loves smiling and playing and both the girls are doing really well and reaching the same milestones together			1
' it has been a very stressful and emotional time but i ’m just looking ahead to having my whole family in one place and getting back to normal			0
' all together now : @entity16 , @entity3 and @entity4 share a cuddle with father @entity27 and big brother @entity29 , three she added : ' being able to tuck them all up at night under the same roof is the best feeling ever because i was so worried it would n’t happen			1
' the changes are just incredible to see in them all and it really is a blessing to have my family all together			0
' having the two girls separated for so long was heart - breaking			0
' we put a teddy bear with @entity4 ’s clothes on in @entity3 ’s incubator at the hospital so she always felt like her sister was there , it always settled her			1
' when we got them both home they have bonded so much and even hold each other ’s hands when they ’re lying next to each other			0
' although @entity4 is now breathing by herself @entity3 has floppy airways , which means she will have a tracheostomy for the next two to three years of her life			1
mrs @entity4 had originally been carrying triplets and it was after losing @entity68 at 14 weeks that difficulties started in her pregnancy			2
@entity3 , pictured shortly after birth , still has a tracheotomy but is finally at home with her sister survivor : @entity4 after she was born			1
@entity16 , 28 , tenderly placed a teddy bear wearing @entity4 's clothes in @entity77 s incubator so that she would feel as though her sister was close the waters around @entity3 broke and it was feared the family would lose her as well as her lungs would n’t develop properly without the fluid			1
but the waters built back up and everything seemed stable			0
then at 25 weeks she was taken to @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity18 , with contractions and in the early hours of july 26 she gave birth to the identical twin girls			0
but while @entity4 was stable and could leave hospital a few months later , @entity3 had to be transferred to @entity92 ’s @entity91 hospital where she was fitted with a tracheostomy to help her breathe			1
she will now have this tracheostomy until she is around three - years - old when her airways have been strengthened			0
the mother - of - three said : ' they were delivered at @entity84 hospital but then taken to @entity100 ’s @entity99 and i followed the next day			0
loving : @entity3 ( left ) and @entity4 grip their mother 's finger shortly after birth ' the neonatal intensive care unit was fantastic and i really ca n’t thank them enough for everything they have done for my baby girls			1
' with @entity3 having the tracheostomy i was terrified as i had some experience of them with being a nurse but i never expected to have to have this for my own child			2
' the staff at the hospitals and all the nurses that still come to our house have been amazing in giving me and @entity27 the training to deal with @entity3 ’s extra care and needs			2
' even @entity29 is involved in helping us care for @entity3 as he knows where different things are and can get them for us and also helps to amuse @entity4 while we are busy with @entity3			1
' it is not the regular routine that most families have but it is what we have been given and so now it is just normal to us			0
' it does n’t bother me that @entity3 needs all the extra care as she has been through so much in her short life and we are just glad to have her and @entity4 at home with us			1
' although @entity4 ( right ) is now breathing by herself , @entity3 has floppy airways , which means she will have a tracheostomy for the next two to three years of her life the family now ca n’t wait to familiarise themselves with a routine that is bound to be hectic with regular hospital appointments and a lot of new experiences			1
mrs @entity4 said : ' the other day we decided to go to @entity151 and could n’t believe how much work there was in getting ourselves and the three children to do a simple shop			2
' @entity3 has a lot of extra things to have with her , such as her oxygen and support for her tracheostomy , so just a trip out for us would take ten times more effort than most other families			0
' getting to go out and do those things was so precious to us though as so far we have only been able to take @entity3 around the hospital			2
' for the past eight months our lives have revolved around going to and from the hospital and getting to do such simple things , such as shopping , with all of our children was just so special for us			0
' we live within a very close community so just walking around @entity151 we were stopped by almost everyone who wanted to be updated on @entity3 ’s progress			0
' without this strong community , fantastic family and friends and the amazing work of the doctors and nurses i do n’t think we would have got through it all			0
' seeing the girls achieve different milestones , such as rolling over for the first time which they both did together this week , makes it all worthwhile and makes the struggle we ’ve had seem like it was nothing			0
' mr and mrs @entity191 , along with friends and family , have raised £ 1,800 to split between the two hospitals as a thank you for all their help			0
they already donated the money for a freezer to store breast milk for the hospital and hope that the further money they raise will go a long way in improving the help the hospital already gives .			0
