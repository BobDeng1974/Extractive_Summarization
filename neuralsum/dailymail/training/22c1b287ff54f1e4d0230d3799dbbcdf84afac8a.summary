we are sitting in the dining room of @entity2			2
the doors are thrown open to the night and a warm breeze carries the whisper of surf			2
' oh , look - a shooting star ! ' our nine - year - old daughter exclaims			1
a definite winter warmer : @entity9 is a guaranteed escape zone for those seeking to flee january in @entity12 it 's like a miniature , tropical @entity14			1
the estate has existed for centuries , but until recently it was being put to a more workaday use			2
much has been written about the perils of sugar dependency			1
the @entity21 island of @entity9 , on which the enchanting chateau is to be found , knows this well			1
it is trying to kick a 350 - year - old habit			1
the @entity26 introduced sugar here in the 17th century , and almost all the island 's agricultural land was once under cane			1
more then half of it still is			0
a place of dramatic contours : @entity9 's ruggedness is summed up by the mountainous bulk of @entity38 but the @entity40 's preferential import agreements are about to end			1
@entity9 knows that the plant which dominates its human history has had its day			1
@entity43 will have to shoulder a greater economic burden			0
so on arrival at the island 's international airport , after an agreeable overnight flight , my wife , two primary school - age daughters and i are confronted with a brand - new terminal which cost a cool $ 300 million ( £ 192 million )			1
it 's the largest structure ever built on the former @entity12 colony			0
it is also rather beautiful , having been designed to resemble the traveller 's palm tree			0
passenger numbers are set to double			1
at least , that is what the @entity9 government hopes			1
it is a long way to travel , but for a young family there is much to do on the verdant land and reef - protected lagoon			1
the natives are super-hospitable and child - doting and , as we are told more than once , there 's ' nothing that will kill you ' on the island			1
a place in the sun : @entity76 stayed amid the luxury of the @entity79 complex on @entity9 that promise has drawn an @entity82 crowd with a smattering of @entity84 and , more significantly perhaps , newly rich @entity85 on a recently opened direct service from @entity87			1
the rugged and relatively undeveloped south - west coast of the island lies an hour 's drive from the spiffy terminal			1
here , the ocean pounds the offshore reef which surrounds the 330km ( 205m ) coastline with a particular intensity			0
and it 's here , between the @entity98 mountains and the sea , that you will find the @entity101			0
established by @entity82 settlers in 1765 , the estate today is some 19 sq miles of hillside , plain and coast			0
the colonnaded mansion where we dine dates from the 19th century , and for much of its previous existence stood at the heart of a huge cane plantation			0
@entity2 's factory closed in 1999 and the @entity9 owners diversified into pineapples , potatoes , peanuts and palms			1
cane is still grown , but has to be harvested by machete , as the rolling hills are unsuitable for machines			0
it takes 14 sticks of cane to produce just one cup of brown sugar			1
the rest of the land has been turned into a five - star resort which encompasses several hotels , private luxury villas for sale or rent , a championship golf course , a top end health spa , all - day kids ' club and , best of all for me , an exquisite nature reserve			2
full of character , charm and grace : @entity144 oozes a classic colonial charm first , let 's deal with the basics			1
the white sand beach is dotted with palm trees and swimming pools are posh and plentiful			0
we are staying in a five - bedroom villa with an infinity pool which offers a view across open country to the mountains			2
our golf buggy is parked outside , so we can better traverse the vast estate			0
to our mild embarrassment , we find we also have a butler called @entity162 , a tremendously efficient lad			0
we allow him to run us a bubble bath			0
he also excels himself as the major - domo of a barbecue on our verandah			2
the family tries kite - surfing in the shallow lagoon			2
one memory will be of our eight - year - old daughter being yanked into the air as the wind catches her mini-kite			2
on another day we take a motorboat through the gap in the reef and on to the high seas			0
we cruise westwards towards the dramatic @entity181 peninsula , a @entity182 , watching a pod of dolphins and a school of flying fish			0
in the end , the natural world trumps the extravagant luxury			0
almost 200 years ago the @entity191 botanist and humanitarian @entity192 was active in @entity2 , easing the plight of plantation slaves while recording and shaping the island 's flora			2
most of what lives in @entity9 today - from the people to the trees - was imported from every corner of the empire			1
@entity192 transplanted bananas from @entity85 , lending a specimen of the fruit to @entity206 , the 6th @entity207			0
today the @entity209 banana is the most popular variety in our shops			0
fly and flop - or not : the former sugar plantation has been transformed into a holiday haven , with golf course my highlight of the trip is a jeep safari through the 1,300 - hectare @entity220			1
it is like a cross between the @entity224 hills and the forests of @entity226			0
pheasants and quail run before us among papaya trees ; above us fly mynah birds , fruit bats and giant dragonflies			0
we come across the chimney and mill wheels of a sugar mill abandoned in 1877			2
we swim under a waterfall and spot @entity239 deer across a glen , then reach the highest point on the estate and the lush world opens up beneath , the white smile of the reef and the ocean beyond			0
@entity248 ( 01293 735831 , www.hayesandjarvis.co.uk ) offers a family holiday to @entity9 , at the five - star @entity250 for seven nights room - only for £ 4,995 per family , based on two adults and two children in a three - bedroom villa , departing on february 26 , 2015			1
the price includes return flights from @entity259 with @entity260 .			0

the island *paradise* of @entity9 is looking to boost its tourist numbers
this pretty isle has long relied on sugar , but @entity40 *regulations* are *changing*
island highlights include the @entity144 - ' a tropical @entity14 '
