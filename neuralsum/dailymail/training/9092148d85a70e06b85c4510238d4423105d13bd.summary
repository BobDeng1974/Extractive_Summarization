by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor work and pensions secretary @entity2 has argued against paying the benefits witheld under the back - to - work scheme the taxpayer faces paying £ 130million in benefits to people who refused to work for free			1
a government back - to - work scheme withdrew benefits from people if they did not take up placements in shops and offices to improve their employability			1
after legal flaws were discovered in the scheme , the government passed retrospective laws shore it up			1
but the emergency laws have been torn up by the @entity20 because it could breach their human rights			1
the legislation was drawn up by @entity23 @entity2 after the government was taken to court by a woman who refused to take a role in @entity28			1
the taxpayer now faces a £ 130million bill for benefits denied to thousands of claimants for refusing to work , after a judge today ruled the retrospective laws were ‘ incompatible ’ with the @entity35			1
the legal battle was sparked by @entity38 graduate @entity37 , 24 , from @entity39 , who challenged having to work for free at a local @entity28 discount store			1
last year the government lost in a @entity43 bid to overturn an earlier ruling that regulations underpinning the schemes were invalid			0
new laws were then passed to overcome flaws identified by three appeal judges in the @entity28 case and to block any attempt to claw back lost benefits			1
mrs @entity53 , sitting at the @entity20 in @entity54 , ruled the retrospective legislation interfered with the ' right to a fair trial ' under @entity57 6 ( 1 ) of the convention			1
welfare minister @entity59 's warned repaying benefits withheld unlawfully would be ' an undeserved windfall ' for claimants – a claim rejected by the judge			0
human rights lawyers said the judgement was a ' damning assessment ' and , if upheld on appeal , could lead to some £ 130 million having to be paid out to thousands of jobseeker 's allowance claimants denied benefits under the schemes			0
@entity73 , of @entity74 ( @entity74 ) , said : ' this case is another massive blow to this government 's flawed and tawdry attempts to make poor people on benefits work for companies , who already make massive profits , for free			2
' last year the @entity43 told @entity2 and the coalition government that the scheme was unlawful			2
' in this case the @entity20 has now told the government that the attempt to introduce retrospective legislation , after the @entity89 had lost in the @entity90 , is unlawful and a breach of the @entity92 and is a further disgraceful example of how far this government is prepared to go to flout our constitution and the rule of law			1
' i call on the @entity89 to ensure that the £ 130 million of benefits unlawfully withheld from the poorest section of our society is now repaid			0
' the legal battle was triggered by a scheme where jobseekers were told to work for free in @entity28 store to gain work experience @entity37 , 24 , from @entity39 , challenged having to work for free at a local @entity28 discount store a @entity89 spokesman said the government would appeal			1
he said : ' we 're pleased the court recognised that if claimants do not play by the rules and meet their conditions to do all they can to look for work and get a job , we can stop their benefits			1
' however , we disagree with the judgment on the legislation and are disappointed			0
it was discussed , voted on and passed by @entity123			0
' while this applies to only a minority of past cases and does not affect the day to day business of our @entity128 , we think this is an important point and will appeal			0
' the new legislation found incompatible with human rights laws is the @entity132 ( back to @entity133			2
but it remains in force and benefits will not be repaid pending an appeal			0
the @entity89 spokesman said : ' the 2013 @entity92 remains in force			0
there is no change to the operation of our schemes from the outcome of the @entity20 today			2
' we will continue to help people back in to work and we will not be repaying any sanctions pending our appeal			2
' in her ruling , mrs justice @entity53 said jobseekers ms @entity37 and @entity152 were both in receipt of jobseekers allowance - ' a subsistence level benefit payable to persons actively seeking employment '			2
at the time of their claiming , it was £ 56.80 a week for those aged 16 - 24 and £ 71.70 for those aged 25 and over			0
under the @entity132 ( @entity164 ) regulations 2011 claimants were required to take part in a variety of unpaid ' work for your benefit ' schemes			0
the retrospective creation of criminal offences and imposition of heavier penalties was prohibited under both international and domestic law , said the judge			0
