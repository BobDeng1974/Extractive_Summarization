by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:02 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 09:01 est , 27 november 2013 a @entity3 commissioner today launched a devastating attack on @entity6 ’s plans to curb benefits for migrants , accusing the prime minister of not telling the truth and fuelling ‘ hysteria ’			1
@entity13 @entity12 claimed action to deter foreign benefits claimants risked presenting the @entity16 as a ‘ nasty country ’ and could be the start of the ‘ slippery slope ’ towards the collapse of the single market			1
the @entity2 boasted that massive immigration from @entity23 had ' did not cause damage ' to @entity16 but actually helped the economy to grow			1
attack : @entity12 , @entity2 , accused @entity6 of not telling the truth about immigration the extraordinary remarks by a senior @entity30 official directly attacking the @entity16 prime minister is likely to fuel growing public anger at the rules imposed by the @entity34 on border controls			1
so we would need a more accurate presentation of the reality not under pressure , not under such hysteria which sometimes happens in this case			0
mr @entity6 today insisted he understood the public ’s concerns , and unveiled a package of measures to restrict access to benefits for @entity34 migrants			1
ahead of the lifting of controls on newcomers from @entity52 and @entity53 on january 1 , he will declare that the founding @entity34 principle of ‘ free movement ’ for workers has gone too far			1
@entity34 jobseekers will no longer be paid housing benefit to subsidise accommodation costs , there will be time limits before out - of - work benefits can be claimed and migrants who currently get jobseekers ’ allowance after less than a month will have to wait three months before claiming			1
when @entity12 was handed the plum job as @entity2 in 2009 , even parties in his native @entity13 said he was ill - suited to the role			1
the economist himself admitted : ' everyone says i 'm an unusual choice			0
' fluent in @entity75 and @entity76 , he studied at the @entity77 and was an active member of the economic section of the @entity80 from 1998 to 2005			0
in 2009 he was forced to deny being a member of the @entity82			0
he earns £ 212,000 - a - year , and has been described as ' probably the most left - wing of the @entity34 's 28 commissioners '			2
he once launched a defence of the @entity86 in @entity87			0
in an attempt to play down tensions with the @entity16 last month , his spokesman insisted he once lived in @entity91 and @entity92 , and likes @entity94 - brewed ale			2
benefits will be stopped after six months , beggars and vagrants from @entity34 countries will be removed and barred from re-entering @entity16 for 12 months and a new ‘ minimum earnings threshold ’ will be set below which benefits that top up earnings , such as income support , will be cut altogether			1
but mr @entity12 tore into mr @entity6 ’s plans , accusing the prime minister of not giving the @entity16 public the truth about immigration			1
‘ this is an unfortunate over-reaction			1
we have been in dialogue with the @entity16 authorities , government offices , in recent years			2
‘ we always encourage a fact - based debate about the current movements of workers and the implications , ’ he told @entity115 ’s today programme			0
‘ so we would need a more accurate presentation of the reality not under pressure , not under such hysteria which sometimes happens in this case			0
’ he went on : ‘ unilateral action … is not really helpful because it risks presenting as a kind of nasty country in the @entity34			2
‘ we do n’t want that			0
i think there are much better ways and we have to look into the situation collectively and if there are real problems we act proportionally and not in such a way			0
’ mr @entity12 insisted the issue was not ‘ immigration ’ but ‘ the free movement of workers which applies to every @entity34 member state ’			1
he said the current rules had been drawn up by all @entity34 member states , including the @entity16			1
in a thinly - veiled swipe at mr @entity6 ’s pledge to return the orginal purpose of the @entity34 as a trading bloc , mr @entity143 added : ‘ it is part of the single market which the @entity16 appreciates so much in the @entity34			1
’ he went on : ‘ if we start to dismantle some of the rules of the single market which should apply to everyone of course others may invent other idea … and then we end up on the slippery slope			0
and that is something that nobody really wants			0
‘ the point is that the @entity16 has not been given all the truth and the full truth about this subject			1
’ @entity6 unveiled sweeping new restrictions on access to benefits for @entity34 migrants he complained that an article by mr @entity6 today drew a link between @entity34 enlargement and the number of migrants			1
‘ well we know that about two thirds of the migrants who go to the @entity16 from @entity175 countries			1
‘ and also if you look at the current movement , much more people moving from for example @entity180 and @entity181 than from @entity52 and @entity53			0
’ he added that there are existing @entity34 rules and safeguards against ‘ so - called benefit tourism ’			2
‘ for example jobseekers allowance : if someone newly arrives to the @entity16 or another country it is the home country which in the first place needs to cover if necessary jobseekers and not the receiving country			2
’ but @entity195 rejected the accusations from the £ 212,000 - a - year @entity197			0
mr @entity6 's official spokesman said : ' as the prime minister was saying in his article , we are not the only country to see free movement as a qualified right			1
i think it is very important to be clear about the measures that the government is taking			0
' the spokesman told a daily @entity210 media briefing that the pm was " of course " confident of the legal basis for his proposals			0
pressed over whether he would go ahead with their implementation regardless of the response from @entity30 , the spokesman said : ' this is what we are going to do			0
' there has been growing anxiety about the impact of restrictions on @entity52 and @entity224 being lifted in january			0
the @entity16 government is under pressure to curb entry to the @entity16 when @entity34 restrictions on @entity52 and @entity53 coming here to work are lifted in january there are fears of a repeat of 2004 when @entity234 opened up the borders to eight @entity3 countries – including @entity23			1
then , officials predicted just 13,000 migrants a year would come but more than a million have arrived			0
mr @entity12 said : ‘ it is true that migration from countries like @entity23 in the last decade was higher			1
’ pressed by @entity115 presenter @entity242 that the figures was ‘ massively higher ’ , mr @entity12 added : ‘ it was massively higher but it did not cause damage			1
it actually contributed to the growth of the @entity16 economy			2
commissioner @entity12 ‘ i think if there are real problems we have to look at those , analyse those together , and if there is any kind of problem we have to reflect together			1
’ however , mr @entity6 accuses @entity234 of a ‘ monumental mistake ’ in failing to control immigration from @entity3			1
he said the last government 's refusal to impose controls on new @entity34 members in 2004 led to a surge in immigration			2
one million people from central and @entity3 now live in the @entity16			2
‘ in 2004 , the @entity264 made the decision that the @entity16 should opt out completely of transitional controls on the new @entity34 member states			1
' they had the right to impose a seven - year ban before new citizens could come and work here , but – almost alone in @entity3 – @entity234 refused it			0
that was a monumental mistake , ’ mr @entity6 writes in an article for the @entity276 today			2
he said ‘ that was the moment to address difficult questions about when to allow new entrants full access to each others ’ labour markets – but the @entity264 ducked these questions			2
’ but @entity234 's shadow home secretary @entity284 accused mr @entity6 of ' playing catch up '			2
she aded : ' why has it taken him eight months to copy @entity234 's proposal to make the @entity288 stronger and clearer ? ' after @entity234 proposed this change in march , the @entity264 said it was all fine and nothing needed to change			0
yet now , rather than following a coherent plan , they are flailing around			0
no wonder public confidence in the government 's handling of this issue has collapsed			0
' this change was only one of @entity234 's proposals			0
the government should also be beefing up enforcement of dodgy gangmasters and targeting sectors that are reliant on migrant labour to ensure they are working to train employees			0
' @entity307 leader @entity306 said : ' @entity307 has driven the agenda in terms of warning of the dangers of opening up our doors to @entity34 nations like @entity53 and @entity52 next year and now we see @entity6 and @entity316 trying to recover from the @entity307 surge			1
' these measures fall way short of what the @entity16 public want though			1
our borders will remain open			0
migrants will still be entitled to out of work benefits after just three months			2
it is n’t nearly good enough			0
