this is the moment that an unexploded @entity2 bomb was detonated after a father - of - two dug it up in the back garden of his home			1
@entity7 , 47 , found the @entity2 three inch mortar while planting a bamboo screen at the rear of his £ 1.25 million property in @entity12 , north @entity13			1
his wife @entity15 , 44 , and their two children @entity16 , 10 , and @entity19 , eight , were also at home when he made the discovery of the device , which weighed the same as a bag of sugar			1
' i was just digging away putting in some black bamboo to screen the back fence , ' said mr @entity7 , editor of online architecture magazine @entity45			1
' i had dug up a lot of bricks already , because , ironically , there had been an air raid shelter at the back of the garden			1
i was really going for it with the shovel and hit something that was metal and then i hit it again			2
the discovery was made by @entity7 as he dug up his garden to make way for a new bamboo screen ' it was about eight inches down and i removed the dirt around it			1
' when i first saw it , i just thought it was a bomb and i was really excited			2
it was about a foot long			0
' i was a bit nonchalant about it and i picked it up and took a picture of it a posted it on twitter asking what to do			0
' someone then told me to call the police			0
but before i did that i made sure i finished the work in the garden because i did n't know if we were going to be evacuated			0
' i called 101 and they were really helpful and said someone would be on the way			0
within five minutes there were three squad cars here			0
' we were told to move to the front of the house and so were all the neighbours			0
my family were a bit nervous about it because they did n't know what was going to happen			0
mr @entity7 sent a message to his @entity94 followers asking what he should do after digging up the unexploded bomb ' all the neighbours knew about it and there was a mixture of excitement and concern over my foolhardiness			1
' when the police were examining it in the garden it was a light - hearted atmosphere , but when the @entity37 guys turned up things went a bit hush hush			2
' i felt a bit left out to be honest , but i thought the whole thing was very exciting			2
' then all of a sudden the guy who was dealing with it got up and brought it through the house with tape around the end and they told us they were going to conduct a controlled explosion in the park			1
@entity123 examined the device in the garden of the £ 1.25million home before taking it to a nearby park and carrying out a controlled explosion ' i was n't worried about it being carried through the house because if it was going to go it would have been when i hit it with the shovel , so i was n't too concerned			1
' i was a bit disappointed when they took it away , because i thought it was my bomb and my discovery			0
' it was only when they took it to the park when i realised it was really live and it was a real bomb			2
i saw the video of the explosion and it was huge			2
' the whole experience was really exciting and i was n't really worried or terrified about it			1
i thought it was interesting			0
' experts believe the device was a three inch @entity154 mortar that had been kept by a serviceman as a souvenir however , the drama has not put him off his gardening hobby and he plans to be turning the soil again this weekend			1
he said : ' gardening is a hobby and a bit of the necessity at the moment			0
the garden needs a bit of work and there is a lot more to do			0
' i 'm going to be out here again next weekend working at it all again			0
' i have been gardening for years and have found lots of stuff at in other gardens , like bottles and horseshoes , but i have never found a bomb and this has to be the highlight of my gardening career			0
' this is the moment that the mortar was detonated in in nearby @entity40 , @entity41 mr @entity7 said ' it was only when they took it to the park when i realised it was really live and it was a real bomb			1
i saw the video of the explosion and it was huge ' mr @entity7 said he found the whole experience ' really exciting ' and was not terrified or worried the bomb was taken to @entity40 , @entity41 , which was evacuated by police where it was destroyed in a controlled explosion mr @entity7 said : ' i saw the video and was amazed at how powerful it was			1
' they even put insulation around it to lessen the effect of the explosion , but it was still huge			2
' since it happened i have been told by a friend it looked like a @entity154 mortar , which may have been brought back by a serviceman after the war and kept in the air raid shelter as a memento			1
