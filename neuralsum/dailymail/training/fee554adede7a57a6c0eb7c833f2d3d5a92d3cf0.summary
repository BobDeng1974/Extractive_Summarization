by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:21 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 08:39 est , 4 june 2013 more than 80 lobbyists have been suspended from the @entity3 in a dramatic attempt to end the latest sleaze scandal			2
commons speaker @entity6 said scores of parliamentary passes are being investigated amid fears they have been used by private firms to gain access to politicians			1
he promised ' urgent and effective action ' over the politicians - for - hire controversy			1
commons speaker @entity6 has suspended 80 lobbyists from the @entity3 the 83 passholders are connected to all - party parliamentary groups , which act as ' special interest ' talking shops but have faced criticism for being a backdoor for lobbyists			1
around half of these individuals are linked to lobbying firms			2
in a statement to the @entity27 mr @entity6 said today : ' as speaker i have long felt that the operation of all party parliamentary groups needed to be improved to meet the high expectations of transparency and accountability required in public life			1
' recent events have heightened my concern and underlined the need for urgent and effective action			2
' more than 100 lobbying professionals are believed to have been handed parliamentary passes by members of the @entity44			1
this gives them the right to roam the parliamentary estate unsupervised			1
some 120 out of 660 people working for peers have also declared they are consultants or lobbyists for businesses and charities			2
at the same time , @entity53 announced that legislation for a statutory register of lobbyists would be rushed out next month			2
the new law will also strike directly at the ability of the trade unions to ramp up @entity61 's campaign machine in the run - up to the general election			1
it will also require unions to comply with potentially costly new regulations to ensure the membership lists they use for strike ballots are up to date			2
ministers conceded that the statutory register of lobbyists – first promised three years ago – would not have prevented the latest scandal			0
proposals to allow voters to ' recall ' disgraced mps will not be published until at least next year , meaning that dodgy mps are highly unlikely to get kicked out before the next election			1
@entity53 said the proposals were part of a ' transparency agenda ' to give the public more information about the impact of lobbying			0
a source said the ' modest ' union reforms were simply designed to ensure strike ballots were valid and to close loopholes in the law that have enabled the unions to get round the £ 19million cap on party spending in election year			1
but @entity61 and the trade unions reacted furiously			0
a senior @entity61 source described the proposals as a ' shabby and panicked ' response to the latest lobbying scandal			1
the proposals on trade union reform also appeared to catch the @entity100 off guard			0
deputy commons leader @entity102 , who is technically in charge of the lobbying legislation , said the idea of a union clampdown was ' premature ' when he was quizzed about the plans shortly after they were announced by @entity109			0
a @entity100 source said the details of the proposed union crackdown had ' yet to be agreed ' within the @entity113			0
yesterday 's move followed a fresh round of lobbying scandals , which saw conservative mp @entity117 and an @entity118 peer resigning the party whip and two @entity61 peers suspended after it was alleged that they had breached parliamentary rules			1
lord @entity123 , the leader of the @entity124 , said an investigation would be launched into the ' very serious and distressing ' allegations of sleaze against @entity128 , former labour cabinet minister @entity129 and fellow @entity130 of @entity131			0
the three , who all deny any wrongdoing and referred themselves to the standards watchdog , were caught in an undercover sting by @entity137 reporters posing as lobbyists working for a fake energy firm			0
lord @entity128 was also targeted , with mr @entity117 , in a separate sting by journalists posing as lobbyists for the @entity144 government			0
mr @entity117 , who referred himself to the @entity145 , is alleged to have been paid £ 4,000 by the bogus lobbying firm and tabled parliamentary questions and a motion , offered a security pass and set up an all - party parliamentary group on @entity144			1
the @entity100 peer @entity151 said the register was only a small step in clearing up the ' stinking swamp ' of @entity3 sleaze			0
he said : ' i regard it a little bit like eradicating malaria in @entity161			0
you use a bit of disinfectant on the mosquito , which a statutory register would be , but we have got to clean out the stinking swamp , which is particularly the @entity44 , where there is a very nasty whiff of dirty money the whole time			0
' @entity173 , general secretary of the @entity174 , last night said the union law was ' naked opportunism ' , adding : ' the government is cynically trying to exploit a political sleaze scandal to crack down on unions – which are democratic and accountable organisations			0
' but ministers believe the change will simply force the unions to comply fully with the spending rules			0
they also hope it will shine a light on @entity61 's dependency on union funding in the run - up to the election .			1

the passholders are connected to all - party parliamentary groups
