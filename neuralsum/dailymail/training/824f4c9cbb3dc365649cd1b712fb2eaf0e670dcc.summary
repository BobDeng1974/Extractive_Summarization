by @entity0 published : 08:15 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 08:34 est , 24 september 2013 it may look like a tranquil walk across a beautiful lake , but for one daredevil climber and sportsman this was no country stroll			2
in stark contrast to the perfectly clam waters of @entity14 , @entity15 , extreme sport champion @entity10 struggled to stay focused as he edged along 250m of slackline			1
but after 35 attempts the @entity15 - born adventurer finally made it to the other end , breaking his own world record for ' waterlining '			1
holding his arms in a horizontal position for half an hour at a time put the athlete in intense pain as his shoulder and bicep muscles started burning			2
he also had to stay focused on the other end of the line for balance , while knowing that at any second a slight gust of wind could send him tumbling			0
on one attempt he made it to within 6 meters of the finish before losing his balance and falling into the water			0
easy does it : @entity10 said the biggest problems were wind and weather conditions which had to be perfect to stand a chance of completing the walk serene : @entity10 said that while on the line he felt connected with nature in the fantastic setting in @entity15 , near to where he grew up extreme : @entity72 ( pictured far right ) is also a world renowned free solo climber and basejumper who has climbed a 1000ft sheer cliff with no safety harness but eventually , 20 days after his first attempt and watched along by family and sports enthusiasts , @entity72 finally reached the other side			1
he said : ' it is an incredible feeling to break your own record			1
the biggest issue is the wind and the weather conditions - you have to wait to make it as perfect as possible for the actual walk			2
' you have to focus and you have to be really patient and accept certain circumstances			0
' ' but the water was beautiful , the sun was shining and the lake was reflecting like a mirror			0
the whole thing was pure , like the water			0
i felt really connected with nature , its energy and spirit			0
' the successful crossing came on the day @entity10 had set as the last one to break his record , as worsening weather and shortening daylight would have put the record out of reach			1
@entity10 , who is also a world - class free solo climber and basejumper , added : ' my cousin and his girlfriend were there on the last day and those guys were just screaming at me for the last few metres - saying " come on , you can do it "			1
' ' it helped me so much because i had n't see those people for quite a long time and they gave me so much of their good spirit			2
' @entity72 now plans to break the record by 10m a year every year for the rest of his life meaning he will have to walk 400m when he turns 40 by crossing the line , @entity10 smashed his own 2012 waterline record of 222m , which he set at the same stunning location , where he also grew up			1
he now plans to continue breaking his record each year by 10m for every year of his life - meaning he will have to walk 400m by the time he is 40			1
mich , nicknamed the ' @entity133 ' , has always prided himself on pushing and opening up new levels in extreme sports and has a total of six records in slacklining disciplines			0
some of his other extreme achievements include climbing 1000ft up a sheer gorge in the @entity142 in the south of @entity144 without a safety rope and scaling 45 floors of the tallest building in the city of @entity149 in @entity150 - again without equipment .			0

@entity10 held the previous record of 222m which he set in the same place
the 250m he completed this time is equivalent to almost three football pitches in distance
the 24 - year - old says he now plans to break the record by 10m a year every year for the rest of his life
