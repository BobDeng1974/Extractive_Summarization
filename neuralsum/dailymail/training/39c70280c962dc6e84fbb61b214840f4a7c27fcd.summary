though women are more likely to be the victims of rape in the military , male - on - male rape is still a serious problem sweeping the @entity7 armed forces			1
in a recent @entity11 article , more than a dozen veterans and current service men came forward to tell of their sexual assault , and how the military institution failed time and time again to bring their predators to justice or get them the psychiatric help they needed			1
when a man enters the military he is ten times likelier to be sexually abused , and in 2012 alone there were an estimated 14,200 reports of male rape			1
all i remember , along with the pain , is the slapping sound of being raped			1
i try to make love to my wife , but i ca n't - i 'm triggered			1
i 'm traumatized by that sound			1
' this is problematic since men are much less likely to report these incidents , leaving their attackers in positions of power and keeping the pain inside to boil over into other relationships			1
the power structure within the military also makes these attacks more prevalent , because men in lower ranks may find it hard to report their attackers if they are superiors			1
' when a gunnery sergeant tells you to take off your clothes , you better take off your clothes			1
you do n't ask questions , ' former @entity56 @entity55 ( name changed ) said			1
before ' @entity58 ' was repealed , it also meant the possibility of a dishonorable discharge for engaging in homosexual behavior			1
when @entity63 was assaulted during his time in the @entity65 in 2007 , he decided not to report the incident for fear it could harm his military goals			2
@entity69 , @entity65 , 2002 - 2007 : ' i had actually let the assault go , because i did n't want it to interfere with my career			1
i wanted to be an officer , and i just said , " bad experience , wo n't let that happen again			2
" but there was some residual damage			2
a month and a half later , i was brought into a room with about nine officers and told , " you 've tested positive [ for @entity81 ]			2
" i was removed from the military and signed out within a day			2
it was a complete shock			2
' @entity84 , @entity25 , 1988 - 1989 : ' i just could n't handle working around men			1
i 've done masonry work , but i 'd last only a couple weeks			2
sometimes sexual jokes would trigger me			1
i 'd be like , " listen , you perverted scumbag ... " when things upset me , i yell [ my attackers ' ] names out to people			2
the guys would just look at you like , this guy is crazy			2

it was a complete shock , ' @entity110 told @entity11			0
and when the men are n't silencing themselves , the military is doing it for them by discharging victims for misdiagnosed personality disorders and letting their attackers continue to serve			1
from 2001 to 2010 , nearly 31,000 servicemen were involuntarily discharged for personality disorders with many being denied free va treatment since many of these illnesses are considered pre-existing conditions			0
but even for those who are able to receive therapy through the @entity125 , many do n't get the kind of help that they need since the programs are mainly designed for women			0
' when i first got out , i tried to seek treatment with the @entity125			0
it became an issue where every time i came back , it was a different person ; they had interns filling in			0
every time , i had to relive telling the story again			0
it just became too much			0
it 's a joke , ' @entity65 vet @entity139 added			0
' one of the doctors said to me afterward , " son , men do n't get raped , " former @entity25 sailor @entity141 said			1
@entity146 , @entity147 , enlisted 2011 : ' he was a senior aide â€” he had a direct line to the top			0
being invited over to his house , i just took it as i should go			0
looking back , i ask myself , why did n't you do anything ? it was n't like he held me down or tied me up			0
i did n't want to cross him			0
i really did n't feel like i had any choice			0
i had just turned 19			0
it could be my career			0
i froze and went along with it			0
' another issue is the military justice system that has only convicted an 7 per cent of all @entity163 cases that go to trial , which is why an estimated 81 per cent of victims never even report			1
@entity168 senator @entity167 fought to change this by proposing the @entity170 that would strip commanders of the power to prosecute sexual assaults , and give that decision to independent military prosecutors			1
while the bill won a majority in the senate , it was not enough votes to beat the threat of a filibuster			0
meanwhile , the victims continue to suffer in silence			1
' i 'm terrified of men			1
i 'm gay and i 'm terrified of men , ' former @entity65 soldier @entity186 ( name changed ) said			1
' i ca n't even get an erection , especially since i got sober			0
i do n't go to movies , i ca n't handle concerts			0
' @entity192 , i went to dinner with some friends , and at one point i started panicking so bad i had to get out of the restaurant			0
i never even told anybody about this until last july			0
do you know what it 's like to live with this for thirty years ? '			0
