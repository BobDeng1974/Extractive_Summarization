the last the world knew of @entity2 , she had withdrawn $ 1,500 from her checking account in february 25 , 2009			1
friends and family did n't see or hear from the woman they described as fun and intelligent in the years since , but they chalked it up to @entity2 's solitary tendencies			1
meanwhile , letters piled up in her mailbox in the middle - class neighborhood where she lived in @entity15 , @entity16 , before being taken back to the @entity17 as unclaimed			1
mummified : @entity2 , who was 44 when authorities believe she died , sat for five years in the backseat of her car mummified a family member even tried to phone in 2012 to tell @entity2 her mother had died , but never got a response			1
mortgage payments kept being deducted automatically from bank accounts flush with cash from @entity2 's job at @entity29 , where she had once programmed banking software			1
it was not until the money ran out in 2013 and the bank foreclosed that @entity2 was finally discovered			1
the @entity34 reports two repairmen , hired to patch a hole in the roof , found her in 2014 , slumped in the backseat of the @entity40 parked in her garage , mummified			1
investigators later noted she was found surrounded by hundreds of unopened letters and several empty packs of cigarettes			2
she had $ 500 in cash in her pockets and a partially drank bottle of wine by her side			0
detectives could n't find a single fingerprint on the bottle			0
the home was in a state of chaos and disrepair - a far cry from the way her friend @entity61 said @entity2 liked to keep her home			1
scene : neighbors said they helped clear the driveway and mow the lawn while they believed @entity2 was still in the home , though many eventually moved away world traveler : @entity2 traveled to @entity70 and @entity71 , as well as around the @entity72 , while working programming banking software for @entity29 ' her house was well - kept , very clean , very tidy , ' @entity61 said			1
' she liked things picked up and ordered			0
' but police found the floors littered with empty soda bottles , more unopened mail , loose clothing and refuse			0
black mold had invaded after the sump pump broke down , with dark spots dotting the walls			0
@entity61 , who had worked with @entity2 when the two lived in @entity86 , @entity87 , said she was ' fun to be around ' and ' very , very good at her job , ' and traveled to @entity71 and @entity70 and throughout the @entity72 for work			1
still , @entity2 was never extremely social			2
siblings recalled long stretches of time where they would n't hear from @entity2 , who would often not return phone calls			1
fun and smart : @entity2 , pictured in this undated photo taken at a coworker 's birthday celebration , was described as an excellent employee mysterious : @entity100 , a neighbor , said he could not have known that the solitary @entity2 was in her garage for five years then a postcard or call came from a far - flung destination like @entity105			1
' sometimes she would go , literally , for years without us hearing from her , ' one sister , @entity106 , who lives in the @entity108 area near where @entity2 and her nine siblings grew up , told the @entity34			2
' and then all of a sudden , she 'd show up , so nobody ever thought anything about it			0
' @entity61 remembers how easily @entity2 could cut people out of her life when , after a friend showed up a few hours late for a party without calling , she immediately ended the relationship			1
' @entity2 told her she was done with her , ' @entity61 said			2
' she did n't speak to her after that			0
' @entity61 said her own friendship with @entity2 ended in 2001 , though she could provide few details beyond saying that they were together too much			2
yet @entity2 was by all accounts still doing well			2
she continued working at @entity125 , where she was an ' exemplary employee , ' management told the @entity34			0
she even began planning to open a small business of her own - a fitness business in nearby @entity128 called @entity129			0
@entity106 , who managed a @entity131 location in @entity132 , agreed to travel to @entity133 with her sister in 2003 , where the two attended a two - week seminar on health in preparation for @entity2 opening her business			2
past due : bills and letters would stack up in @entity2 's mailbox and then be returned to the @entity17 unclaimed , a letter carried told the @entity72 postal inspector in 2014 towed : authorities dragged out the 2003 green @entity40 that once belonged to @entity2 where she was found dead and mummified that plan was never fully realized			1
court records showed the owners of the property sued @entity2 in 2005 for breaking her lease , though @entity2 never responded to the complaint			2
credit card companies also initiated three lawsuits against her from 2005 to 2007 over unpaid bills , receiving judgments that added up to over $ 15,000			0
her homeowners association placed liens totaling more than $ 2,000 against unpaid dues for the association			0
@entity2 was n't always shut in her home , though it was often unclear where she was			1
officers checked on her home in 2005 , when neighbors told them they had not seen her in a month			0
inside the home , police said they rescued her abandoned cat , @entity169 , and white poodle , @entity171 , but while the pets were kept in a shelter - baby was later adopted - there 's no evidence @entity2 came to collect them			2
sister @entity177 looks over an image of @entity2 in the 1983 cardinal @entity179 , an all - girls catholic school yearbook in @entity108 ( file photo ) in may 2008 , she resigned from her job under circumstances that are unclear , then in october of that year , she was cited for driving with a suspended license , expired plates and no proof of insurance			0
there 's no record of @entity2 after the 2009 cash withdrawal , and investigators , who checked credit card statements and subpoenaed bank , phone and health records in a ' massively thorough ' search say her cause of death is undeterminable			1
' there was no trauma to body , so it only leads to a couple conclusions , ' @entity200 sheriff @entity199 said			0
' either it was a medical situation that led to her death or something self - induced			0
' medical records showed @entity2 , who was 44 when investigators believe she died , smoked more than a pack a day and in spite of being worried about her liver , drank regularly			1
other family members dealt with cancer , heart disease , high blood pressure and kidney disease , according to that report			0
but the tank in the car still had two gallons of gas left , which led investigators to rule out carbon monoxide poisoning and her organs were so mummified , according to deputy medical examiner dr @entity225 , making a toxicology report impossible			1
the case is now inactive , leaving relatives wondering what happened to their sister that would have ended her life quietly and out of sight			0
' i just do n't understand why anybody would sit in the backseat of their own car			2
and just stay there , ' @entity106 said			0
' why would you do that ? '			0

@entity2 of @entity15 was found mummified in the backseat of her car
investigators believe she died at 44 in 2009 but it was n't until 2014 her body was discovered
relatives and a friend described @entity2 , who lived alone , as smart and fun but often solitary
her remains were in such a state of *desiccation* that the medical examiner was unable to conduct a full autopsy and the cause of death is *unknown*
she was only discovered after bank foreclosed on her house
