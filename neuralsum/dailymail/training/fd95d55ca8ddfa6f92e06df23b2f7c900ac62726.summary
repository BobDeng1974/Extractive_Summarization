by @entity0 published : 16:56 est , 25 may 2012 updated : 16:57 est , 25 may 2012 loyal : @entity2 was still honoured by his surviving wives despite his atrocities @entity2 's three wives remained fiercely loyal and refused to give information following the death of the terror - leader , it has been revealed			1
the three women were arrested by @entity12 security forces after the @entity14 raid on @entity2 's safe house in the town of @entity17 , about 35 km ( 60 miles ) from the capital @entity19			1
slowly puffing on a cigarette in a rundown @entity19 villa a @entity12 intelligence agent described months of questioning the women and said he struggled to glean any worthwhile information			1
@entity27 - born @entity26 , the youngest of the three , was headstrong and showed fury when asked questions , while the others , @entity31 citizens , expressed displeasure by mostly keeping silent behind their veils , the agent said			2
all appeared to strongly support @entity2 , despite the militant 's long and bloody record of orchestrating violence across the world			2
' they were all nostalgic whenever they talked about him , ' said the intelligence agent , a slim man in a dark suit			2
' i could sense @entity26 was always angry whenever i spoke with her , ' he added			0
' she objected to being questioned and rarely gave away anything			0
' but at times @entity26 was somewhat flexible			0
' @entity47 once told me that she and @entity2 liked @entity48			0
she seemed like a rebel so i questioned her about @entity51 leftists			0
i found her very interesting , ' said the agent			0
it was not possible to independently confirm his account			0
@entity48 was an @entity56 @entity55 who was a major figure in the @entity59 revolution			0
he was executed in @entity60 in 1967			0
keeping an eye on things : the now famous picture of @entity2 watching the tv in his hideout - he was soon found and killed scene : the hideout house of @entity68 leader @entity2 where he was killed by @entity69 in a ground operation in @entity12 's hill city of @entity17 @entity47 , who was wounded in the raid that killed @entity2 , traveled to @entity75 to marry @entity2 when she was 18 years old and he was in his early 40s , her father told @entity76 in an interview in @entity27 in 2011			1
' the other wives did n't say much			0
they were boring , ' said the agent			0
@entity12 deported @entity2 's three widows and 11 children to @entity31 last month			1
a @entity12 court had sentenced them to prison for entering @entity12 illegally and ordered their deportation after the end of their prison term			1
loyal : @entity26 , one of @entity2 's wives , has stuck by her husband in spite of his atrocities the agent did not say whether other @entity12 or @entity95 officials questioned the women			1
he also did not give details on whether his questioning included anything about the night of the raid			0
based on his conversations , the agent said he concluded the @entity68 leader lived in the country for about six or seven years , in two towns			1
@entity12 officials describe @entity2 's long presence in the garrison town of @entity17 as a security lapse and reject suggestions that members of the military or intelligence services were complicit in hiding him there			2
@entity12 dismisses @entity115 criticism of its performance against militancy , saying it has sacrificed more lives than any other country which joined the @entity95 war on militancy after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the @entity95			2
@entity12 also stresses that it captured several high - profile @entity68 figures on its soil such as @entity125 , the self - confessed architect of the sept. 11 , 2001 attacks			1
the intelligence agent , who said he questioned the widows once a week , sometimes twice , recalls seeking information on whereabouts of other senior @entity68 leaders , and coming up empty handed			1
' i wanted to know if any others are in @entity12 , ' he said			2
' i wanted to know about @entity134 , ' he said , adding that he did n't believe the former @entity136 doctor and current @entity68 leader @entity134 was in the country			1
turning to information he said he had come across on @entity68 over the years , the agent said he was convinced that @entity134 was running @entity68 's show in the region			1
' @entity2 was an inspirational figure for militants			0
it was @entity134 who was the main man			2
he was much more violent than @entity2 , ' he said			0
' these are my conclusions '			0
the intelligence agent said @entity12 authorities had retrieved some computers and cellphones from @entity2 's @entity17 home , but trying to make sense of coded @entity154 language proved frustrating -- with only a few clues on @entity68 activities in @entity12 's northwestern tribal areas			1
the agent was non-committal about @entity12 doctor @entity159 , who was sentenced to 33 years imprisonment by a court this week for running a fake vaccination campaign that helped the @entity163 pinpoint @entity2 's location in @entity17			1
' discovering that @entity159 was helping the @entity163 and arresting him was not a problem , ' he said without elaborating			0
but the agent , who was once stationed in @entity17 while @entity2 was said to live there , only shrugged when asked how it was possible that the @entity68 chief evaded capture in @entity12 for so long despite a global manhunt			1

three women keep quiet after interrogations by @entity12 agent
all support dead @entity68 chief despite atrocities
aim to track down new leader @entity134 proving *fruitless*
