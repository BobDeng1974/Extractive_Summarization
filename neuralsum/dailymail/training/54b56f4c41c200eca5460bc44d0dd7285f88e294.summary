by @entity0 last updated at 6:47 pm on 25th october 2011 the father of a severely disabled 22 - year - old woman is fighting a legal battle to keep her in school after a council insisted she was no longer entitled to publicly - funded education			1
@entity7 wants his daughter @entity8 , who suffers from @entity10 's syndrome , to continue studying at @entity11 , @entity12 , until she is 25			0
but @entity13 say she was no longer entitled to publicly - funded education once she reached the age of 19			1
appeal hearing : the @entity16 in @entity17 where @entity7 is fighting a legal battle to keep his disabled daughter in school the battle has been taken to the @entity22 where senior judges will decide on the woman 's future			1
it is seen as a vital test case which could see thousands of adults with learning difficulties continuing into state - funded education and sharing classrooms with children , costing local councils millions			1
the court heard that miss @entity34 , who is from @entity12 , entered mainstream education when she was five but was always one year behind her peers and was transferred to the specialist @entity11 in 2006			2
she has a reading age of nine , can not tell the time and has no concept of money , but she loves drama , dance and the expressive arts			0
she continues to study at the college , which , with the approval of her father , is happy for her to stay on until she is 25 , the court heard			0
but , since 2008 , the council has insisted her statement of special education needs only ran until she was 19 , after which she would not be entitled to publicly - funded education			1
following a long - running legal wrangle with her father , the council has now brought the case before the @entity22 , asking three senior judges to rule on the issue			1
decision to make : lord justice @entity59 is one of the @entity22 judges who will make a decision on @entity34 ' future in education @entity64 , for mr @entity7 , told the court a ' flexible approach ' should be taken , which would prevent those who need continuing education ' falling off a cliff when they hit 19 '			2
he said : ' although a statement can only be made in the first place for someone who is at the time " a child " , statements do not automatically lapse , for example simply because the person ceases to be " a child "			0
' @entity80 , for the council , warned judges that allowing students with special educational needs to continue in schools past 19 would have a massive impact on local authorities around the country			0
she said : ' there are approximately 223,000 children and young people in @entity91 and @entity92 with statements of special educational needs			2
' this case is about @entity34 and its facts , but it is applicable to the other young people approaching or having reached 19 , who may well wish to stay in school until their late twenties			2
' ' it is a point of real importance , as it raises a significant issue of principle as to when a local authority 's responsibility ceases for those with statements of special educational needs			0
' local authorities have , to date , considered that their responsibilities end , in line with the code of practice , the year that a child becomes 19			0
' this also raises questions about the designation of schools and how they would manage to accommodate these individuals , and also practical questions about safeguarding younger children if there are a cohort of adults being taught with them			1
' recognising the widespread importance of the case , lord justice @entity59 , sitting with lord justice moses and mrs justice baron , reserved their judgement , which will be given at an unspecified date in the future .			0
