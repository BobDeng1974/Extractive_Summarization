the silver - haired pensioner asked @entity5 to add his name to the likes of @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 who had previously autographed her book			1
she was amazed when he quickly drew a sketch of a shark in @entity45 , which represented his famous work of art of a tiger shark immersed in formaldehyde			2
the keen snooker supporter is now selling the ' @entity51 ' and the rest of the @entity54 - themed autograph book , because it would be too risky to rip the drawing out			1
the artwork is set to fetch up to £ 5,000 at auction			1
it is said the snooker player signatures , and those of some dart players , add ' about £ 10 to £ 15 to the value '			2

' i grabbed my book again and made a bee - line for him			0
@entity86 was on the stage with him			0
' i waited for him to come off and just said to him ' mr @entity5 , is it possible for me to have your autograph ? ' ' he said ' certainly ' and he wrote my name at the top of the page and he signed the bottom and i wondered why he left a gap in the middle and he started to doodle			1
' it did n't take very long and i worked out very quickly what it was			0
' i have had the book for five years and it is very nearly full			0
' i am 75 and my children do n't want it			0

@entity119 , of @entity116 , said : ' we advised the vendor not to rip the hirst page out and to leave it with the rest of the autographs because they give it some context			0
