by @entity0 , @entity1 on sunday chief football writer @entity3 remains the main man , for now at least			1
however , the days of being the overwhelming , dominant force of this @entity7 team may be over for good			1
in 2006 , a nation seemed to have a collective manic episode over the state of @entity3 ’s metatarsal and when he arrived back at the @entity14 camp in @entity15 having been cleared to play , he was reported to have said : ‘ the big man is back in town			2
’ it does n’t feel like that any more for @entity7			2
he does appear to be on an upward curve of fitness and his performance on friday night against @entity25 demonstrated that he will do his share of work for the team			0
in doubt : @entity3 is still @entity7 's main man but his days in that role could be numbered industrious : against @entity25 , @entity3 put in a good shift and worked hard for his team - mates without scoring early finish : @entity3 was replaced by @entity38 in the 66th minute of the game but after the 3 - 0 win , @entity40 was moved to write on @entity42 : ‘ headline from this game is ‘ ‘ what does @entity45 do with @entity3 ? ’ ’ now @entity47 is lead striker , where does he play him , if at all			1
’ @entity51 himself is protective of the @entity54 striker while also dismissing the idea that there is something sacrosanct about @entity3 ’s place in this team			1
‘ i think it ’s a bit sad that the country is so @entity3 - obsessed , ’ said @entity51			1
‘ i do n’t think @entity3 sets himself up to be anything other than a very , very important member of the squad , someone who does his best and tries his best at all times			2
‘ as far as i ’m concerned , talk about combinations does n’t interest me			0
all i want is for @entity3 to play well and for @entity47 to play well , to score goals and to create goals			1
‘ that ’s what they ’re in the team for and that ’s what we work hard to help them to do as a team			0
but certainly we do n’t have the same obsession with @entity3 or @entity47			1
‘ we also think that people like @entity83 , @entity38 , @entity84 and @entity85 , they ’re in there to help us play well and score goals , too			1
that ’s what the squad ’s about			0
‘ obviously @entity47 and @entity3 would like to be the first two names on the list and to do that they ’ll have to continue to do well			1
’ new crop : @entity51 has earmarked @entity83 as one of many players able to score for @entity7 next generation : @entity38 has broken into the @entity7 squad after impressing for @entity98 on the rise : @entity84 's form for @entity101 meant @entity51 could n't ignore him in demand : @entity85 's starring role for @entity104 has earned him a starting place for @entity7 @entity40 did later mitigate his tweet , adding : ‘ @entity107 remembering this was @entity3 ’s first game for a while			1
he ’s scored bags of goals for @entity7 and can play out of customary position			2
’ the reality is that @entity3 , who missed the last three games of @entity54 ’s season with a groin injury , is still likely to start in @entity117 against @entity118 on june 14 , though he must be aware that he is no longer seen as untouchable			1
seasoned @entity3 observers know that if he is not up to speed in the first 15 minutes of a match , he is not the kind of player to grow into his game			2
@entity125 away during @entity14 qualifying would be an example of when the @entity7 bench could have reasonably substituted him at half - time , rather than after 73 minutes			2
in @entity132 2010 , the possibility of dropping @entity3 was raised but @entity133 would not countenance it			2
in his mind , @entity7 were so bereft of world - class players that to ditch one of the few was madness			1
no chance : @entity133 would n't countenance dropping @entity3 for @entity7 change of plan : unlike past managers @entity51 may consider @entity3 's place for @entity7 the problem was that while his performances four years ago did not merit inclusion , the options were limited in @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 , all of whom had good @entity154 records without troubling the world ’s best			1
this time it feels there is greater flexibility , though the alternatives , in @entity38 , @entity84 and @entity85 , are incredibly raw			1
this management team will be more focused on what works for the team rather than soft - pedalling the star names			0
one of the frustrations for @entity165 , now @entity51 ’s assistant , during the 2006 @entity14 was @entity168 ’s indulgence of players with the biggest reputations			1
‘ @entity168 was clearly worried about leaving out one of his big players , whether that was @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 or @entity178 ’ , wrote @entity165 in his autobiography			0
‘ but it had to be done if it would benefit the team , and i definitely believed it would help keep the side on their toes			0
but because we ’d become so used to this first xi playing all the time , to leave out one of the stars had become a big deal			0
’ ruthless : @entity7 coach @entity165 has spoken about not playing the best players but the best team @entity51 is clearly still considering the possibilities for @entity118 , saying there are ‘ too many options ’ in the front five positions to have settled on a team yet			1
‘ obviously we have a fairly clear idea of what we want in the back positions , ’ said the manager			0
‘ but once you get past @entity177 in the midfield , there are five positions to fill and i think there are a lot of options there			2
’ @entity51 was irritated that the wave of enthusiasm for the likes of @entity84 and @entity38 came at the expense of @entity3 on friday night			1
‘ it ’s a little bit infuriating to see players who come on in the last 10 or 15 minutes , when the game is over and there are lots of spaces and the opposition are on their knees , compared to players who have had to go out for the first 15 , 20 minutes of the game when the opponents are 100 per cent fit , very , very determined to keep you at bay , throwing themselves into challenges and getting 10 men behind the ball			0
’ but that point could equally be turned into a positive			0
bringing on @entity84 , who was clearly keen to impress in his 10 minutes against @entity25 , could be an option for the final 20 minutes in the humidity and heat of @entity117			2
the extra work @entity3 must do , tracking back as a secondary striker , will come at a physiological cost in the heat and humidity of the @entity243 jungle			1
taking him off would mean he would remain fresher for the games @entity7 really have to win , against @entity246 and @entity247			0
@entity84 for @entity3 , along with @entity38 for @entity83 , may just jolt the @entity248 and ensure they endure a nervous final quarter of the match			1
no tired , drained defender would relish facing those two , fresh in the final minutes of a crucial game			0
taking @entity51 at face value , that is an option he is prepared to consider			0
he purports not to understand the fuss about @entity3 or players of the ilk of @entity177			2
on the up : @entity3 missed the final three games of the season for @entity54 but his fitness is n't in doubt ‘ i ’m not focusing on one individual			0
i do n’t come to press conferences thinking : “ what am i going to say about @entity3 or @entity177 today ? ” ‘ i think about : “ what am i going to say about the game ? what am i going to say about the team ’s performance ? and what am i going to say about any of the 11 players ”			1
for me , @entity177 and @entity3 have never asked to be elevated to the position where they are now			0
they got there because they ’re good footballers and they deserve to be there			0
‘ they know full well , as senior players with a lot of caps , there ’s a bit more responsibility resting on their shoulders than for a @entity38 or a @entity84 , who have hardly played a game			1
but they also know that i ’m fully aware of that and that i do n’t expect any more of them than what they can give			0
‘ i selected @entity3 for his skills and i selected @entity177 for his skills			0
all i want is for them to bring those skills , that i see in a @entity54 shirt and @entity98 shirt , to an @entity7 shirt and if they do that i ’m more than happy			2
’ the age of the individual appears to be over			0
if so , it is good news for @entity7			0
and it is good news for @entity3 , too			0
released from unrealistic expectations , he may have his best @entity14 yet			0
freedom : @entity51 's refusal to rely on individuals could result in @entity3 finally hitting form for @entity7 in a @entity14 yet to make a mark : the 28 - year - old has n't scored for @entity7 at a @entity14 and time could be running out			1

@entity3 is no longer untouchable *due* to *emergence* of new players
form of @entity47 , @entity38 , @entity85 and @entity84 give @entity7 options
@entity51 is not happy to rely on individuals like past managers
former @entity7 striker @entity40 *questioned* @entity3 's place in team
