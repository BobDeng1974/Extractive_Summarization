sufferers may feel sad or low , unable to cope , and hostile or indifferent to their husband , partner or baby			0
they may have thoughts about death , be unable to sleep , and feel hopeless about the future			0

treatments for @entity123 include counselling and psychotherapy , and antidepressants , which can be very effective			0
