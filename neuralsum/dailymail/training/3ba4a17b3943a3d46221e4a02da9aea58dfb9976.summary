by @entity0 published : 05:46 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 08:25 est , 26 july 2012 a convicted child rapist sexually assaulted a 12 - year - old girl after spiking her @entity4 drink with vodka while on bail for another sex attack on a youngster			1
@entity9 , 64 , was given the opportunity to offend again after his court case for a vile attack on a young girl was delayed because of government funding cutbacks			1
the paedophile had been due to stand trial in may for sexually abusing a 10 - year - old girl last july and superimposing her face onto pictures of topless models			1
but his case was adjourned until june 12 this year after @entity24 spending cuts reduced the number of trials sitting at @entity27			1
depraved : convicted child rapist @entity28 ( left ) sexually assaulted a 12 - year - old girl after spiking her @entity4 drink ( right , file picture ) with vodka while on bail for another sex attack on a youngster despite @entity34 , from @entity35 , @entity36 , previously serving a 12 - year prison sentence for raping a six - year - old girl in 1987 , he was allowed out on bail after being charged with the sexual assault			1
the delay in his trial gave @entity34 the chance to strike again and four days before he was due back in court he spiked a 12 - year - old girl 's @entity4 drink with vodka before sexually abusing her			1
last friday , he was finally jailed after he admitted the two sexual assaults and making indecent images of children			1
he was sentenced indefinitely to imprisonment for public protection and must serve a minimum of three years and three months before being considered for parole			2
judge @entity54 told him : ' that does not mean you will be released then			0
' you will only be released once a determination has been made you are no longer dangerous and that may be a very long time indeed			0
' july 2011 : family of 10 - year - old girl make complaint to police about @entity28 august 8 : charged with sexual assault august 24 : @entity64 appears before @entity66 magistrates and granted conditional bail october 5 : appears again before @entity66 magistrates and granted conditional bail as case is sent to crown court october 31 : appears at @entity27 and pleads not guilty of sex assault june 9 , 2012 : he is arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting a 12 year old girl june 11 : breach of bail hearing at @entity77 and remanded in custody june 12 : appears at @entity27 , above , and pleads guilty to two sexual assaults and making indecent images of children july 20 : jailed indefinitely for public protection children 's charities blasted the decision to release @entity34 on bail in the first place			1
the @entity24 also waded into the debate today by telling @entity89 that dangerous offenders ' should always be remanded into custody ' while awaiting trial			1
@entity93 , deputy director of @entity94 , said : ' this is a horrific and worrying case of sexual abuse			0
' not only is @entity34 a dangerous paedophile whose rehabilitation was not effective , but also the system that is designed to protect children has clearly failed			1
' the apparent failure of effective management of this case is partially to blame for the harm the girls and their families have suffered			0
' there are many questions which need to be answered if the public are to have faith in the safeguarding system			0
' i am particularly concerned that cutbacks in the number of trials at @entity115 is allowing dangerous offenders to have extended access to the public and risk further assaults			1
' @entity119 , head of the @entity122 's @entity121 programme said : ' as this man was a convicted child rapist serious consideration should have been given to keeping him in custody			2
' he had already proved a risk to children and this should have been taken into account when he appeared in court to face this new charge			0
' there are always various matters to be considered when someone is given bail but protection of children should always be the priority			2
' the court heard @entity34 was arrested in july last year when a 10 - year - old told police he regularly touched and kissed her when alone			2
shockingly , despite his earlier conviction for child rape , he was granted bail by magistrates in @entity66 and ordered to stand trial in may			1
but when his trial was adjourned as a result of a cluttered court timetable , he targeted a 12 - year - old in @entity151 , @entity152			2
@entity153 , prosecuting , told the court : ' while on bail for the @entity66 offence and a week before his re-listed trial , the defendant sexually assaulted another victim			2
' on saturday , june 9 , an ambulance was called to her address where she was extremely intoxicated			0
' paramedics arrived and the defendant tried to drive away , but the ambulance blocked him in			0
' she was incoherent and extremely distressed			0

she was incoherent and extremely distressed			0
' officers discovered the girl 's @entity4 drink had been topped up with vodka			0
a @entity24 spokesperson said : ' dangerous offenders who pose a threat to society should always be remanded into custody while they await trial			1
' the decision to grant bail is taken by the police and courts based on the full facts of each case			2
' the overwhelming majority of people bailed do not reoffend and are often given strict conditions such as electronic tags and curfews			0
' anyone who reoffends while on bail will usually receive a longer sentence as a result			0
