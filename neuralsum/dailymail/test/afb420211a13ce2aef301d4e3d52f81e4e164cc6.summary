it is a source of music , information and entertainment for millions of listeners around the world yet vast numbers of people are being denied the chance to enjoy @entity9			1
many of the smartphones on sale today - including @entity14 ’s iphones , @entity17 ’s @entity16 phones and @entity19 phones - come with built - in @entity9 chips			1
however , nearly two thirds of smartphones do not have the feature activated			0
now the radio industry , faced with the rise of digital radio , are calling for this to change			0
many smartphones on sale today - including @entity14 ’s iphones , @entity17 ’s @entity16 phones and @entity19 phones - come with built - in @entity9 chips			1
however , nearly two thirds of these devices do n't have the feature activated			0
now the radio industry , faced with the rise of digital radio , are calling for this to change broadcasters , including the @entity36 , are pushing for the mobile industry to activate the @entity9 chips within smartphones to allow users to access their free radio feature			1
it is thought many mobile phone network providers are reluctant to allow this because it would reduce demand for data used by streaming internet broadcasts			2
the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) in the @entity50 , which has been one of the loudest campaigners on the issue , also warns that @entity9 on mobile phones could prove vital in an emergency			1
it said that @entity9 is the most reliable way of broadcasting emergency information during times of national crisis and by allowing access to it on smartphones would mean such messages could reach almost everyone , no matter where they are			1
@entity66 has announced that it will be the first country in the world to switch off its fm radio signal			0
the @entity66 government said it will turn off its fm transmitters on january 11 2017			0
with the ever expanding number of digital radio services and growing numbers of people choosing to listen to internet radio , it seems likely other countries will follow @entity66 's example			1
the @entity79 had planned to switch off its own @entity9 service by 2018 but the plans were later shelved following objections from commercial radio stations			1
it is now not expected to happen until sometime after 2020 when digital listeners are expected to outstrip those using analogue stations			0
in the @entity50 , around 85 per cent of @entity50 adults still listen to am / @entity9 stations			1
the @entity49 claims that the top 10 phones on the market already include radio chips that are not activated and would have little impact on battery life			0
@entity95 , spokesman for the @entity49 on the campaign , told @entity97 that giving users @entity9 would allow them to avoid expensive data charges and save battery life			1
he said : ‘ listening to streaming drains your battery three to five times faster than listening to the exact same content on the @entity9 chip			1
‘ when the power grid is out , the only lifeline for the @entity50 public is having an @entity9 tuner			2
’ in the @entity79 , many cheaper mobile phones come with fm radio activated			0
smartphones produced by @entity114 and @entity115 also come with the ability to listen to fm radio			2
around 21 per cent of adults in the @entity79 say they have listened to radio using a mobile phone or tablet at least once a month during 2014 , but many of these may have been using apps rather than @entity9 chips			2
in the @entity50 the figures are lower as the availability of phones with fm radio activated is lower			0
devices such as @entity14 ’s @entity131 also contain the technology to allow @entity9 radio listening – they are included on the chip that also receives @entity136 and @entity137 radio signals			1
in the @entity131 6 , for example , the @entity139 chip has its fm functionality switched off			1
devices such as @entity14 ’s @entity131 also contain the technology to allow @entity9 radio listening – they are included on the chip that also receives @entity136 and @entity137 radio signals			1
in the @entity143 ( pictured ) , for example , the @entity139 chip has its fm functionality switched off other smartphones running @entity145 , including some made by @entity17 and @entity19 , also suffer from the same problem			1
however , turning these on is not a simple task			0
many of these phones also lack the @entity9 antenna needed to receive a signal			2
some phones use the headphone cords as an antenna , but this would need to be connected to the smartphone devices			0
there is also commercial resistance to activating these @entity9 chips			2
mobile service providers are increasingly attempting to attract customers by offering music streaming services , according to a report by @entity165			0
@entity14 is also preparing to launch its own music streaming service			2
other smartphones running @entity145 also suffer from the same problem			0
@entity17 's early models came with @entity9 but the firm was criticised for not including it in the @entity171 ( pictured ) @entity9 is seen by some as an archaic technology that will be replaced with digital radio			1
@entity66 has become the first country to announce it will switch off its fm radio service in 2017 and other countries are expected to follow			0
however , the @entity36 has been leading a new project to combine internet radio with @entity9 or @entity180 to produce a hybrid radio service			1
called the @entity182 , is has been discussing how to develop the technology with smartphone manufacturers			0
@entity185 , director of @entity186 , said : ‘ there is an enduring love for radio and easy listening on the move is critical for this			0
‘ this @entity79 - led global partnership is a response to listeners ’ demand for simple , charge - free radio in mobile phones			2
’ in the @entity50 , 32 mobile devices now carry a @entity200 hybrid radio chip pre-installed			2
according to @entity202 , administrator for the @entity203 , radio is critical in a crisis			0
speaking in a video on the @entity207 campaign site , he said : ‘ as more and more people use their smartphones as streaming devices to get news , get radio , get a lot of things like that over their networks , i do n't think people realize how vulnerable they get			0
’ @entity219 , a radio futurologist , added : ‘ there 's clear evidence that people love @entity9 in their phone			1
‘ i find it odd that @entity50 mobile networks seek to ignore what their consumers want , in favour of forcing them to pay more on data			0
’ the @entity230 , however , insists that mobile phone users prefer to stream , download and customize music playlists in a way that @entity9 does not allow .			2

many smartphones - including @entity14 's @entity131 - come with an @entity9 chip installed but many are not switched on by the manufacturers
@entity36 and other broadcasters are pushing to have radio *capability* turned on
they say it would allow users to listen to broadcasts without data charges
it could also prove a vital way of getting information during emergencies
