@entity0 is digging his heels in at @entity2 and the @entity4 club will have to pay £ 16million for him to leave			1
the £ 50m flop has attracted interest from the likes of @entity8 , but any buying club will struggle to pay @entity0 ' £ 150,000 - a - week wages			1
the @entity12 striker therefore wants @entity2 to pay up the two years remaining on his deal - totalling around £ 16m - if he is to leave the club			1
the striker , who posted a video of himself undertaking the @entity20 in @entity22 to @entity52 on monday , did n't make the bench for @entity26 's side 's 2 - 0 win over @entity28 on saturday , with new signing @entity56 and returning @entity59 icon @entity58 both preferred			1
despite leaving @entity0 out of the win , @entity26 insisted he needs three strikers in his squad : ‘ i want three strikers in the team			1
sometimes i want to play with two and have one on the bench			1
at other times , someone will be suspended , another will be injured			0
' someone will be needed as a third striker			2
i ca n’t do a season without a third striker			2
our squad was made carefully the top structure of my club to give me what i want			0
‘ i believe he will remain			0
he will be very useful for us			0
he is a fantastic guy , fantastic professional , so no problem			0
' i told the players yesterday that at this moment we are playing one match a week and they feel : “ oh , i ’m playing , i ’m not playing			2
i ’m first option , i ’m second , i ’m third			0
” ' but this is over next week			2
after that we have @entity87 and @entity38 and three matches a week			0
everything is much easier for them then because all of them will be playing			0
‘ the reason he was n’t on the bench today was that i decided to have a balanced bench with one defender , one full back , one defence midfielder , one attacking midfielder on winger and one striker			1
sometimes i can have two strikers on the bench sometimes i ca n’t			0
’ is the exit that way ? @entity0 looks ready to leave @entity2 after his initial £ 50million move from @entity34 dropped : @entity0 was left out of the @entity2 squad for their game against @entity28 in the @entity19			1

@entity2 will have to pay £ 16million for @entity0 to leave @entity4 as two years left on deal will earn him £ 150,000 - a - week
@entity8 are interested in the striker but can not afford his *expensive* salary
@entity0 did n't make the bench for @entity26 's side 's 2 - 0 win over @entity28 on saturday in @entity19
