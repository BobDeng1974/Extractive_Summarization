@entity1 manager @entity0 has echoed the sentiments of new @entity4 boss @entity3 in criticising the demands of their pre-season tour			1
@entity0 said it was ' impossible ' to prepare his squad properly for the upcoming @entity11 campaign , which begins on august 16 , given the demands of their pre-season schedule and players returning later than normal after @entity17 duty			1
' these training camps in the modern game are decided for commercial reasons and because of the extent of popularity of the club , ' the @entity35 told a news conference on thursday			2
' we 've never been to the @entity24 before and i was very happy to come to @entity42 - a city i love			2
' but for purely football reasons , the best thing to do is stay and not travel too much because of the time you waste and the jet - lag you suffer is not ideal			2
' worry : @entity0 is concerned about the effects of travel on his players in run - up to new season @entity1 are without a host of internationals following the @entity17 and @entity0 highlighted the difficulty in players beginning the intense domestic campaign so soon after returning from the tournament			1
' this season is a @entity60 year and very difficult because the time is very short between the final , which was on july 13 , and the start of the new season on august 16			0
' and compulsory , from @entity65 , you are obliged to give four weeks ' holiday to the players , so i do n't know how all that works together			1
it looks , to me , impossible			0
' @entity0 's comments came days after @entity19 said @entity4 's pre-season tour was wrongly being dictated by the club 's commercial interests			1
commitment : @entity76 and @entity77 take part in training session in @entity80 on thursday @entity4 beat @entity81 7 - 0 on wednesday , and now face games in @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			0
@entity19 's team potentially face a fifth game on august 4 , less than two weeks before they kick off their @entity11 season at home to @entity90 on august 16			0
' more or less , yes , ' @entity19 told @entity92 media in the @entity24 , when asked whether the demands were hindering their preparations			1
' we have to prepare the season and when you have commercial activities and dreadful distances , having to fly a lot and the jet lag , it is not very positive for a good preparation			0
' @entity104 not good for @entity4 - @entity19			0

*wenger* *unhappy* with tour demands and late return of players
@entity1 are without a host of internationals following the @entity17
