by @entity0 published : 16:52 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 16:56 est , 2 august 2013 a jury recommended friday that three @entity3 pirates be sentenced to life in prison in the slayings of four @entity7 aboard their yacht off the coast of @entity10			1
prosecutors had sought the death penalty , but a federal jury in @entity14 , @entity15 , recommended the only other possible sentence for @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
formal sentencing will be this fall			0
the three men were among 19 who boarded the @entity23 in february 2011 in hopes of taking the @entity7 back to @entity3 and ransoming them for millions of dollars			1
the plan fell apart when the @entity26 began shadowing the sailing vessel			2
life in prison : pirates @entity19 , left , @entity17 , and @entity18 , back , will likely face life in prison for killing a group of @entity7 in 2011 @entity18 @entity19 @entity17 the yacht 's owners , @entity35 and @entity36 of @entity37 , @entity38 , and their friends , @entity40 and @entity41 of @entity42 , @entity42 , were shot to death several days after they were taken hostage at sea			1
the @entity26 had told the pirates that they could keep the yacht in exchange for the hostages , but they refused to take the deal because they did n't believe they would get enough money			1
the only person authorized to negotiate the @entity7 ' release was also based in @entity3			1
with the yacht nearing the @entity3 coastline , the destroyer @entity55 began maneuvering between the @entity23 and the @entity3 shore when a rocket - propelled grenade was fired at it			2
held captive : @entity36 and @entity61 owned the quest and were shot dead by the group of pirates as the @entity26 tried to secure their release victims : the owners of the @entity23 had been traveling with @entity41 and @entity40 of @entity42 , who were also killed soon after , gunshots were fired on board the quest			1
by the time @entity72 scrambled aboard , all four @entity7 had been mortally wounded			2
they were the first @entity7 citizens killed in a wave of pirate attacks that have plagued the @entity75 and @entity76 in recent years			2
in their justification for seeking the death penalty , prosecutors wrote that the men killed or attempted to kill more than one person during a single episode			1
they also said their actions endangered the @entity7 military and that the @entity7 were killed ' in an especially wanton and gratuitous manner			2
' in the case of @entity89 , prosecutors said he has demonstrated a lack of remorse in the @entity7 ' deaths and made boastful statements about them			2
defense attorneys for @entity89 had argued he should not be eligible for the death penalty because they claimed he is mentally handicapped			1
defense documents say @entity89 has a low iq , a poor memory and had difficulty functioning as a child in @entity3			0
defense attorneys also noted in court filings that his co-defendants describe @entity89 as ' slow ' and inept at fishing			0
ransomed : the @entity7 were sailing off the coast of @entity3 when a group of pirates stormed their boat the quest , hoping to take them back to land and hold them for ransom the @entity7 @entity114 has banned executing those with certain mental disabilities			1
prosecutors argued @entity89 is competent , and chief @entity7 district judge @entity118 issued an order that concurred with that assessment			0
' the court finds that @entity89 failed to prove ... that he suffers from significant deficits in intellectual functioning or adaptive skills			0
thus , he is determined not to be intellectually disabled , and is , therefore , eligible for the death penalty , if so imposed by the jury , ' @entity118 wrote in an order			1
the decision to seek the death penalty was made by attorney general @entity132			1
executions under federal law are extremely rare			0
only a handful out of more than 1,300 executions since 1976 having been carried out by the federal government , according to the @entity138 , which tracks statistics			0
eleven other defendants who were aboard the @entity23 have already pleaded guilty to piracy and have been sentenced to life in prison			0
four other suspected pirates were killed aboard the yacht			0
a fifth suspected pirate was released because he was a juvenile			0
another man who prosecutors say was a land - based negotiator and the highest - ranking pirate they 've ever captured has also been convicted of piracy and sentenced to a dozen life sentences in prison			0
pirating problem : the four @entity7 who died were just the first targeted in a long string of pirate attacks that continued in the @entity75			0

a federal jury recommended @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 for life in prison
the three men were part of a group of 19 who boarded an @entity7 sail boat off the coast of @entity3 in 2011
they killed all four *passengers* when the @entity26 *intervened* , trying to secure the hostages release
the jury could have recommended the death penalty
