imagine a world where mosquito - sized robots fly around stealing samples of your dna			1
or where a department store knows from your buying habits that you 're pregnant even before your family does			0
that is the terrifying dystopian world portrayed by a group of @entity13 professors at the @entity14 in @entity15 on thursday , where the assembled elite heard that the notion of individual privacy is effectively dead			1
imagine a world where mosquito - sized robots fly around stealing samples of your dna - hat is the terrifying dystopian world portrayed at @entity15 Â© @entity24 ( @entity25 ) ' welcome to today			1
we 're already in that world , ' said @entity28 , a professor in computer science at @entity13			0
' privacy as we knew it in the past is no longer feasible ... how we conventionally think of privacy is dead , ' she added			1
experts predict technology will lead to : mosquito - sized robots fly around stealing samples of your dna department stores knowing from your buying habits that you 're pregnant even before your family does governments are talking about putting in back doors for communication another @entity13 researcher into genetics said it was ' inevitable ' that one 's personal genetic information would enter more and more into the public sphere			1
@entity50 said intelligence agents were already asked to collect genetic information on foreign leaders to determine things like susceptibility to disease and life expectancy			1
' we are at the dawn of the age of genetic @entity61 , ' she said , referring to witch - hunts against @entity63 in 1950s @entity64			0
what 's more , @entity28 imagined a world in which tiny robot drones flew around , the size of mosquitoes , extracting a sample of your dna for analysis by , say , the government or an insurance firm			1
invasions of privacy are ' going to become more pervasive , ' she predicted			1
' it 's not whether this is going to happen , it 's already happening ... we live in a surveillance state today			0
' political scientist @entity81 tackled the controversial subject of encrypted communications and the idea of regulating to ensure governments can always see even encrypted messages in the interests of national security			0
' governments are talking about putting in back doors for communication so that terrorists ca n't communicate without being spied on			0
' the problem is that if governments can do that , so can the bad guys , ' @entity81 told the forum			2
' are you more worried about big brother or your nasty little cousin ? ' however , despite the pessimistic orwellian vision , the academics were at pains to stress that the positive aspects of technology still far outweigh the restrictions on privacy they entail			1
experts warn that stores will soon know from your buying habits that you 're pregnant even before your family does			0
in the same way we can send tiny drones to spy on people , we can send the same machine into an @entity118 ward to ' zap the germs , ' @entity28 said			0
' the technology is there , it is up to us how to use it , ' she added			2
' by and large , tech has done more good than harm , ' she said , pointing to ' tremendous ' advances in healthcare in some rural areas of the developing world that have been made possible by technology			2
and at a separate session on artificial intelligence , panellists appeared to accept the limit on privacy as part of modern life			2
@entity138 , chairman of @entity139 , an @entity64 tech firm , took the example of @entity141 guessing -- usually correctly -- where you want to go			0
' at first , i found that spooky and kind of scary			0
' then i realised , actually , it 's kind of useful , ' he told the forum			2
@entity147 , a young tech entrepreneur , told the same panel that what he termed the ' @entity141 generation ' placed far less weight on their privacy than previous generations			1
' i trade my privacy for the convenience			2
privacy is not something that worries me , ' he said			0
' anyway , people often behave better when they have the sense that their actions are being watched			0
' the @entity14 in the swanky @entity162 ski resort of @entity15 brings together some 2,500 of the global business and political elite for a meeting that ends saturday .			1

researchers told @entity15 that privacy is already non existent
say technology will allow *governemtns* and insurance firms to steal dna
also *claims* the same technology could help *eradicate* disease
