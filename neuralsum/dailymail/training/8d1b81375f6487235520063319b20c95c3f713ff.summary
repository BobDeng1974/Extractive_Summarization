one doctor did suspect she might be suffering with the condition , that causes an embryo to implant outside the uterus , but was unable to confirm a diagnosis because the hospital 's specialist scanning service was closed for the weekend			1
the family of @entity18 , 28 , were this week given an undisclosed six - figure compensation payout after the hospital trust admitted she was misdiagnosed and that their failings contributed to her death			0
the family of @entity18 were this week given an undisclosed six - figure compensation payout after a hospital trust admitted she was misdiagnosed and their failings contributed to her death mrs @entity28 , who already had two children , visited @entity33 's @entity32 department with stomach pains late on a friday afternoon			1
medical staff suspected she had gastroenteritis and sent her home with painkillers			1
one doctor - it later transpired - suggested she should be scanned for any possible complications with her pregnancy , suspecting she may have an ectopic pregnancy			2
but the hospital 's specialist scanning department was closed for the weekend so he asked mrs @entity28 to return on the monday for a scan			1
the next day @entity18 complained she was in even more pain so she returned to the @entity49 hospital			2
incredibly , the @entity32 registrar still diagnosed it as gastroenteritis and simply sent her home with stronger painkillers			2
mrs @entity28 had only discovered a few days earlier that she was seven - weeks pregnant			2
the following morning , at around 7.30am , she collapsed at home into the arms of her then 12 - year - old daughter @entity56 , and suffered a heart attack			1
ms @entity28 only found out she was seven - weeks pregnant a few days before she died			0
she collapsed at home into the arms of her then 13 - year - old daughter @entity56 , and suffered a heart attack paramedics worked frantically to revive her and she was rushed into hospital by air ambulance			1
she then suffered a second cardiac arrest while undergoing an emergency operation to remove her fallopian tubes			0
mrs @entity28 was kept on life support , before the agonising decision was made to switch it off and she died on december 20 , 2010 , her daughter @entity56 's 13th birthday			1
tests revealed @entity18 had experienced an ectopic pregnancy			0
details of mrs @entity28 's death emerged this week after it was revealed her family had been given a compensation payout by @entity33 and @entity79			1
medical director dr @entity80 said : ' the trust sincerely and unreservedly apologises for the failings that contributed to death of mrs @entity28			2
' in order to ensure that such failings do not happen again the trust has introduced a range of measures including strengthening the emergency gynaecology service , which is now centralised at @entity90 , and as a result of which patients now have better access to senior staff , diagnostic equipment and treatment of emergency situations			0
' he said scanning equipment and senior medical staff in women and children 's services were now available 24 hours a day including at weekends at @entity90 , which only opened about 18 months ago			0
@entity18 , from @entity33 , was married to @entity105 and had two children , @entity56 , now 15 , and @entity107 , four			0
@entity108 , of @entity109 , @entity110 , who represented @entity18 's family , said : ' this is a devastating case for everyone involved			0
the @entity114 needs to be as effective during the weekend as it is during the week			0
' studies have suggested that death rates at hospitals in @entity118 can be up to 25 per cent higher at weekends , and @entity114 medical director sir @entity119 has said he would like hospitals to function as effectively at weekends as during the week .			0
