by @entity0 published : 05:49 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 09:41 est , 9 may 2013 these bizarre images show a group of owls marching through a @entity5 farm in search of dinner for their newly - born young			1
the birds , who had just hatched owlets , strutted while they hunted for food			2
the scene was captured by photographer @entity14 , who said he had to stay camouflaged and stop himself from laughing so he would n't disturb the birds			0
he said : ' they are both fascinating and amusing at the same time			0
ungainly take off : the bird looks more assured with both feet on the ground as it stalks for prey @entity21 first : the owl 's fascinating movements were captured by photographer @entity14			0
in this action shot , the bird lunges forward with both legs stretched behind him - perhaps he is preparing to fly on the march : the speckled owl has a determined look in its eye as he pushes ahead from the pack			1
the owl 's movements mimick that of a marching army hop to it : the owl looks serene as it moves through the air , on a mission to find food ' they have such personalities and facial expressions it was incredibly difficult not to laugh at times as the action was genuinely funny			1
' they give no warning and move erratically in random directions when they decide to move			0
that is difficult for me to predict and also difficult for the camera electronics to keep the owls in focus			0
' it actually reminded me of the nursery rhyme ' @entity55 ' because of their movement			1
' these owls are definitely at the top my of favourite things to take pictures of - i never get bored of watching them			2
' left , left , left , right , left : this image of the owl head - on shows him balance on one leg in a regimented fashion on the move : the owl stretches its talon in mid-air as it struts to find food for its young			1
the pictures give an up - close look at the bird getting in a flap : the brown owl extends a wing and looks ready to fly as it gains momentum on the ground			0

images capture the moment owls march through a @entity5 farm to find food for their newly - born young
photographer said funny *walking* motion *reminiscent* of @entity55 nursery rhyme
