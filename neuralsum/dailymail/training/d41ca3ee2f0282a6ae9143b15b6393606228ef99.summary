a diagnosis of cancer is among the worst news anyone can receive			2
but hundreds of thousands of patients have considered not telling close friends and family about their diagnosis , new research shows			2
the main reason for keeping loved ones in the dark was to protect them worrying about the bad news			1
up to a quarter of people diagnosed with cancer say they considered not telling friends and family they were ill ( file picture ) while women are generally known to be good communicators , the study found they were most likely to keep a diagnosis to themselves			1
of those questioned , 25 per cent said they had considered not telling family , compared to just 18 per cent of men			1
the poll , commissioned for @entity31 , also found there was a marked difference between not telling a spouse or partner about diagnosis , with 4 per cent of women considering it , compared to just 1 per cent of men			1
there are two million people in the @entity42 living with or having survived cancer , according to the charity @entity45			0
nearly 20 per cent of adults polled knew someone who had decided not to tell a close family member or friend about their diagnosis			0
however over half said they would respect the person 's decision to keep a diagnosis to themselves			0
but the rest admitted they would feel sad , disappointed and shocked			0
the main reason for patients keeping the diagnosis secret was to enable to life to carry on as normal as possible - or to protect those closest to them			1
half of people said it would to be avoid sympathy or special treatment , while a third simply wanted to manage and deal with it on their own			1
@entity71 , @entity72 at @entity31 , said : ' every patient reacts differently to their cancer diagnosis			1
while women are generally known to be good communicators , the study found they were most likely to keep a diagnosis to themselves ( file picture ) ' we are finding more patients choosing to keep their diagnosis to themselves and dealing with treatment on their own , or until they have come to terms with it			1
' the cancer charity @entity45 explains some patients feel guilty , perhaps believing they have caused the cancer themselves in some way			0
it adds : ' however , in most cases it ’s not clear what ’s caused someone ’s cancer			0
there is no reason to blame yourself			2
' although some of your family and friends may find it difficult to talk about your cancer , the best way to overcome this difficulty is often by talking			0
even so , it ’s not always easy telling family and friends about your illness			2
' the charity 's website advice on the matter , which can be accessed here .			0
