by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 13:39 est , 15 may 2013 updated : 18:38 est , 15 may 2013 the jury found @entity3 eligible for the death penalty today following her murder conviction for killing her lover			1
jurors reached their decision on wednesday just hours after the prosecutor went through stab wound by stab wound that she inflicted on @entity3 during the prolonged killing			1
last week she was found guilty of the premeditated , first - degree murder of @entity16 after stabbing him more than 27 times , slicing his throat and shooting him in the bathroom of his @entity20 , @entity21 home in june 2008			1
@entity16 's two sisters sobbed as the medical examiner explained how each of the stab wounds caused tangible pain			1
the trial moves into the final phase on thursday , in which prosecutors will call @entity16 's family and other witnesses in an effort to convince the panel @entity63 should face the ultimate punishment			1
@entity63 ' attorneys also will call witnesses , likely members of her family , in an attempt to gain sympathy from jurors so they give her life in prison			2
today 's aggravation proceedings were intended to start on thursday but @entity63 was put in a psychiatric hold and under suicide watch after telling a local news station that she would rather receive the death penalty as opposed to life in prison because she expects that she will live a long time			1
@entity85 shot : prosecutor @entity47 went through each of the more than 27 stab wounds that @entity16 suffered tough job : defense attorney @entity88 spoke briefly about the need for the jury to focus solely on whether the murder was an ' especially heinous ' one the jury had to decide whether the convicted murderer will spend the rest of her days behind bars , or if she could be sentenced to death			1
that is determined by the nature of the crime , meaning that they have to decide if it was an especially cruel , heinous and depraved killing and if so , then they may sentence her to death			1
prosecutor @entity47 took the floor first on wednesday , describing how the angles at which she stabbed @entity16 as he lay on the floor of his bathroom shows that she was standing above him			0
' we know that he was alive in the sense he could see , breath and hear what was coming , ' @entity47 said			0
' mr @entity16 suffered pain every time that blade entered his body			0
' she made sure of it , by stabbing him over and over again ... then finishing him off across the throat			0
' gut - wrenching : @entity119 turns away from the screen as autopsy photos were shown of her slain brother waiting for justice : his friends and relatives have said previously that they hope she is sentenced to death he talked about how at one point during the attack , @entity16 tried to defend himself and she came at him from behind			2
while that would have come as a surprise in certain circumstances , @entity16 was trying to stand up by the sink and would have seen her coming in the mirror			0
the courtroom was shown pictures of @entity16 's bloody body , zoomed in on the wounds on his back and the back of his head			2
relatives of mr @entity16 were seen openly weeping , covering their faces and looking down when the graphic photos were shown			0
even @entity63 started crying , covering her face and swiveling her chair to turn away from the screen			0
her fate : since she was found guilty last wednesday , @entity63 said that she would rather be sentenced to death instead of receiving life in prison , and as a result she was on suicide watch for the past week graphic : medical examiner @entity159 told how parts of @entity16 's skull were chipped off by the knife as @entity63 stabbed him in the back of the head during the attack physical battle : @entity63 ' other ex said that she was in good physical shape , explaining that she would have been able to fight @entity16 even though he was bigger than she was defense attorney @entity88 spoke briefly about the need for the jury to focus solely on whether the murder was an ' especially heinous ' one			1
@entity47 called his first witness , medical examiner @entity173 , who went through the various wounds			0
he said that an examination of @entity16 's head showed ' triangular pieces of the skull that have been gouged out by the knife			2
' he went on to say that it was his belief that @entity16 was still alive when he was being stabbed in the back of the head , stabbed in his back , and when his throat was slit			0
one of the most jarring portions of wednesday 's testimony came when nothing was said at all : in an effort to prove that the attack - that is thought to have taken just over two minutes - was not as short as it sounds , @entity47 told the court to sit silently for that time and think about how it would feel if you were being attacked continuously			1
@entity16 's siblings were seen crying , their shoulders shaking , throughout			2
reliving it : pictures of the stab wounds on @entity200 ' back were shown to the court which was too much for his relatives to take			0
@entity63 even turned away at different points @entity63 ' state - appointed defense attorney @entity88 said that jurors need to remove the emotion from their decision , specifically mentioning the two - minutes of silence			1
' your duty as jurors is to detach yourself from that emotion , from that passion , ' he said in his closing arguments			2
since the jury already knows that @entity63 murdered @entity16 , the biggest legal hurdle for @entity47 is to convince them that either the victim suffered pain , and that the attacker knew that she was inflicting pain			0
as part of that , @entity47 repeatedly referred to the story that @entity63 said during her lengthy testimony during the original trial when she said that after being arrested she planned on killing herself but decided against it when she pricked her finger with a razor and stopped because ' it stung '			2
' @entity3 did n't have that choice , ' @entity47 said			1
' every time that blade cut into him it hurt him			0
this was not a sting			0

decision was reached during ' aggravation ' phase of @entity21 trial - where jurors agreed @entity3 's murder was ' especially cruel and heinous '
