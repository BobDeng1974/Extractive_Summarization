there is something distasteful about shaking hands with a killer			2
what makes that sense of unease even worse is when you know that the person you are meeting was responsible for one of the worst atrocities of the @entity11			2
it was just such a situation i found myself in one weekday in june 2007 , in a suburb of @entity16			2
standing at the door to his flat on the top floor of an apartment block was a kindly looking 93 - year - old man , who i was to interview for a book i was writing on the hunt for @entity26 war criminals			0
the old man ’s name was @entity29 , and yesterday he died at his home in @entity31 at the age of 100			1
they say that only the good die young , and in this instance , the bad certainly died old			0
a row has raged for days over the officer 's last burial place after because authorities fear the grave could become a site of pilgrimage for his neo-nazi fanbase for the man in front of me was a former @entity48 captain who had helped to organise and had participated in the notorious @entity50 massacre in 1944 , in which 335 innocents were slaughtered on the orders of @entity53 as a reprisal for a partisan ambush in @entity16 in which 33 @entity57 troops had died			1
our interview was conducted in @entity60 , which he had learnt while working as a waiter at the @entity63 in @entity64 in the 1930s			0
as he ushered me into his flat , i thought of a document i had seen only recently in the @entity68 back in @entity64 , in which @entity29 had calmly told a @entity70 war crimes investigator how he had ‘ killed a man with an @entity31 machine pistol ’ , and how towards the end of the massacre , he had ‘ killed another man with the same machine pistol ’			1
as well as taking part in the shootings , @entity29 drew up the list of those who were going to be shot			1
he spent the whole night combing through the records of those whom the @entity83 were holding on suspicion of being in the resistance			0
to get the numbers to the ten to one ratio that @entity53 had demanded , @entity29 even included political prisoners who had been arrested on the flimsiest of evidence			1
some of those on the list were teenagers , with the youngest being just 15			0
remorseless : @entity29 picutred during a court appearance in 1996 , he had previously been jailed for life by a military court for the massacre of 335 men and boys at the @entity50 near @entity16 on the morning of march 24 , 1944 , the prisoners were taken by the @entity48 and the @entity57 to the @entity50 , south of the centre of @entity16			1
with their hands tied behind their backs , they were led into the caves in groups of five , and then shot in the back of the head			2
a report written by an @entity31 professor of legal medicine in september 1945 conveys the full horror of what took place			1
‘ the victims fell face downwards , and gradually , as the other condemned arrived , they were obviously made to climb up on the other bodies of the previous victims , otherwise the position of the bodies in layers and their almost uniform prone position could not be explained			0
’ in order to give his men the wherewithal to commit mass murder , the senior @entity48 officer provided them with a caseload of cognac			2
as the day wore on and the alcohol was imbibed , their shots became less accurate , thus even depriving their victims of a clean kill			0
this , then , was the savagery which @entity29 had helped to oversee			1
to my astonishment , on the day we met , even though it was only 10.30am , he wondered whether i might like to share a bottle of red wine			0
could i accept such hospitality from such a man ? in the end , i agreed , rationalising that superficial conviviality would make for a more revealing interview			0
as it happened , it did , and what took place that morning was , to the best of my knowledge , the last interview that @entity29 gave			1
death : @entity29 , who carried out one of @entity31 's worst massacres , died today aged 100 he told me about his childhood , and how the early deaths of his parents meant that he had to work at 14			1
he started working at a hotel in @entity162 , later moving to the @entity63			0
he walked to the hotel from his digs in @entity164 , and was in the city for the @entity166 of @entity167 in 1935			0
‘ people from all over the world came , ’ he said with fond recollection			0
‘ @entity171 and people like that ! ’ but the war changed @entity29 ’s trajectory , and his linguistic ability caught the eye of the @entity48			1
intelligent and able , he joined its leadership school , and by february 1941 , he had been made a police attaché in the @entity83 embassy in @entity16			2
during our talk , it became clear that @entity29 had no wish to discuss the massacre			1
and there seemed little point asking him , as he had no doubt rehearsed tired old lines about ‘ following orders ’			0
but he did tell me how he had escaped from the @entity70 in 1946 , and how he and his wife and two children had been helped by members of the @entity196 to start a new life in @entity198			1
outrage : in the lead up to his birthday @entity201 groups called for celebrations to be banned @entity29 arrived in @entity204 without a bean , but he built himself up to become a pillar of the very @entity208 town of @entity209 in @entity210			1
astonishingly , he lived openly under his own name , and he and his family were even registered with the @entity83 embassy			0
for half a century , @entity29 lived unmolested , until in 1994 he was accosted by @entity214 , of @entity215			1
when the report was televised , the @entity31 public were incensed that @entity29 could walk around freely , and in 1996 he was extradited to @entity31 , where he faced a series of trials that made headlines around the world			1
in march 1998 , he was sentenced to life imprisonment			1
at the age of 84 , he was too old for prison , so he was detained in his apartment , where he would spend the rest of his days , and where i would interview him			2
appeal : @entity29 is escorted by police as he is transferred to the @entity231 military prison in @entity16 in the 1990s fascist followers : @entity31 king @entity53 , ( right ) @entity53 ( centre ) and @entity234 ( left ) but despite his harmless appearance and the hospitality , there was plenty of the unrepentant @entity26 in @entity29			1
he told me that the then @entity240 , @entity241 , did not wish to help have him released because he was ‘ afraid of the @entity201 ’			0
@entity29 also appeared to deny the @entity242 when he said to me – ‘ we did not act against them for practical reasons			2
we needed the railway cars for other things			0
’ after more than two hours , our conversation came to close			0
i left his flat , retrieved my passport from the policeman who guarded the block , and walked out into the sunshine			0
on a nearby wall i noticed some graffiti which read , ‘ death to @entity257 ’			0
yesterday , that wish was finally granted – seven decades after so many men were brutally executed while this dead - eyed monster picked his victims out and pulled the trigger again and again .			2

@entity29 was *convicted* for his part in the massacre of 335 *civilians*
the men and boys were rounded up by his ss *squad* and shot
@entity29 escaped to @entity198 in 1946 and found work as a school *teacher*
he was deported to @entity31 and sentenced to life in prison in 1998 but because of his age was allowed to serve his sentence under house arrest
