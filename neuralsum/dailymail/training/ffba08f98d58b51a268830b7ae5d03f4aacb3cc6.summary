more than 90 villagers are feared to have been snatched by @entity2 militants from the same area where they seized nearly 300 schoolgirls at gunpoint two months ago			1
@entity6 security forces said they were investigating reports of the mass kidnapping as negotiations for the release of the schoolgirls appears to be making little progress despite @entity13 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 specialists being involved			0
if confirmed , the latest abduction would fuel public and anger frustration over @entity22 's inability to quell @entity2 's five - year campaign to carve out an @entity2 state in the mainly @entity26 north			1
in the original attack , the militants had stormed a secondary school in the village of @entity38 on april 14 , about 93 miles from @entity48 - the cradle of the @entity2 insurgency - and packed the teenagers onto trucks and disappeared into the border area near @entity59			1
@entity2 , which has killed thousands in bomb and gun attacks , initially focused on government and security targets , as well as churches and @entity26 leaders that rejected its brand of @entity67			2
but recently it has increasingly targeted civilians , emboldened by global publicity after it kidnapped the school at @entity38			2
the abduction of the girls triggered worldwide outcry and sparked a ‘ bring back our girls ’ campaign among celebrities , politicians and on social media			0
still held : though reports claim 50 of the schoolgirls captured in @entity38 in april have escaped , the majority are still being held by @entity2 fighters , who are calling for the release of their detained members @entity2 , whose name roughly translates as ‘ @entity88 education is sinful ’ has killed thousands since 2009			1
@entity89 estimates about 1,500 people have been killed in northeast @entity6 in the first three months of this year			0
so far , 57 of the schoolgirls have returned to their families after escaping or being released by kidnappers on health grounds , leaving 219 unaccounted for			0
many are feared to have been taken across the borders into neighbouring @entity59 and @entity97 .			0
