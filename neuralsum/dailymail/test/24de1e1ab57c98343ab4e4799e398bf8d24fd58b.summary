sit down for a moment			2
then clasp your hands together so your fingers entwine — do n’t overthink it ! now look at your thumbs			1
which one is on top — the left one or the right ? if you are a man , the odds are it will be the left ; if you are a woman , it is more likely to be the right			0
now unfold your hands and take a look at your fingers , in particular your index finger ( next to your thumb ) and your ring finger ( next to your little finger )			1
it can be quite subtle , but in men the ring finger ( measured from the crease where it joins the hand ) is likely to be longer than the index finger			0
in women the two fingers are typically the same length			1
of course , we all have different skills and interests , but some are considered more typically male , and occur more commonly in men , while others are described as more typically female , and occur more commonly in women			1
according to popular mythology , men tend to be more obsessed by things such as cars and obscure facts			0
you find men in pubs discussing the top speed of a car they are never going to drive , let alone own			0
they cling to the tv remote control			0
they like spending time in sheds			0
women , on the other hand , are said to be better at empathy and understanding what another person is feeling or needs			1
in an emotional crisis , they are more likely to offer sympathy			0
if you are a man you may be surprised to learn that there are more than 400 different human emotions			0
if you ’re a woman you probably knew that already			0
this is the stuff of jokes and self - help books — but it is also shown to be true through science			1
the question is , do these tendencies result from nature — with the biological gender we are born with deciding our interests and personalities — or do they result from nurture , with society and upbringing creating the differing ways that men and women behave ? in the @entity87 series horizon professor @entity84 and dr @entity85 examine the links between gender and the brain the @entity92 series @entity93 asked professor @entity84 and me to investigate			1
we started from very different positions			0
@entity97 thinks apparent brain differences between the sexes have been exaggerated by how our culture treats boys and girls			1
in the programme she carries out fascinating tests to prove her point , such as dressing up little boys as girls and vice versa and watching how people treat them			0
almost immediately , the girls start rough - housing and playing with trucks , while the boys are treated far more gently by the adults around them			1
she argues that parents ’ unconscious actions — such as being gentler with girls and letting boys behave more roughly — often mould children into men and women who embody gender stereotypes			1
while i agree that lots of wild generalisations about men and women are bandied around , i also think there may be something in claims that our fundamental biology influences how we behave			1
professor @entity129 , an expert on the brain who i visited at @entity132 , has done a lot of pioneering work on this			1
he believes , broadly , that people of whatever gender fall somewhere along a ‘ systemiser ’ to ‘ empathiser ’ spectrum			2
@entity140 : according to popular mythology , men tend to be more obsessed by things such as cars and obscure facts , like these young train spotters pictured at @entity148 and @entity149 station systemisters are people who enjoy breaking down and analysing systems			0
they are more likely to become train spotters or computer scientists			0
they are what he has called ‘ male brained ’ — as these qualities occur most frequently , but far from exclusively , in men			2
@entity163 , on the other hand , are more typically ‘ female ’ brained as they are more typically women			2
although there are exceptions , most men — when tested — come out as more ‘ systemising ’ than ‘ empathising ’ , while for women it is the other way round			0
while professor @entity129 accepts social pressures are important in influencing choices and behaviour , his studies suggest the hormones babies are exposed to in the womb can also shape the brain			1
higher levels of testosterone in utero , for example — as measured in long - term studies that took samples from pregnant women then followed their children from birth — are associated with offspring who are less empathetic but better at some mental skills later in life			1
in other words , more testosterone during pregnancy produces babies with a more male brain ( we ’re not yet sure why some mothers produce more testosterone )			1
dr @entity85 will examine if habits , characteristics and preferences are a result of ' nature or nurture ' @entity163 , on the other hand , are more typically ‘ female ’ brained as they are more typically women an indirect way of assessing how much testosterone you were exposed to is by looking at your fingers			1
a number of studies have shown that the greater the difference between the length of the ring finger and the index finger , the more ‘ male ’ your brain is likely to be			1
mine is slightly more ‘ male ’ than average but much less so than , say , a professional footballer , who is typically male brained with great spatial awareness skills			1
as you can imagine , this is a controversial area of science			0
professor @entity129 does these studies because he is interested in autism , which he describes as an extreme version of the male brain — more interested in systems and often struggling with empathy			1
when he started his research there was a lot of criticism , based partly on the fear studies like his will be used to support unhelpful stereotypes — suggesting men ca n’t excel in female areas and vice versa			1
ignoring gender differences , however , comes with its own dangers			2
take the problem of pain			0
a while ago , when i was making a programme called @entity251 , we did a survey where we asked people which of the sexes they thought was better at tolerating pain — 81 per cent of women said ‘ women ’ , while a mere 11 per cent thought men were the tougher breed			0
a number of studies have shown that the greater the difference between the length of the ring finger and the index finger , the more ‘ male ’ your brain is likely to be although men were more inclined to give themselves the benefit of the doubt , the majority , 54 per cent , still agreed ‘ women ’ were more stoical			1
but is this right ? one way to find out is to get male and female volunteers to take part in a cold water immersion test			1
this is a standard pain test widely used because it causes acute pain without doing any long - term damage ( as long as you do n’t do it for more than 15 minutes )			2
in this test , you put your hand in a bucket of ice - cold water and see how long you can keep it there before the pain becomes intolerable			2
i ’ve done it a couple of times and oddly enough after the initial shock it does n’t actually feel cold ; below about 3 degrees celsius your pain receptors overwhelm your temperature receptors so you are no longer able to tell if the water is hot or freezing			0
all you know is that it is incredibly painful			0
when this test is done in a laboratory setting , men almost always outlast women			0
this may be pure machismo , but professor @entity305 of @entity306 , @entity307 , thinks there is more to it			0
as he puts it : ‘ there are all kinds of reasons to believe there are different neural systems in the brain of males and females			2
’ that is , our brains process pain differently because our brains are different : our varying ability to withstand pain is proof			0
he thinks it is unfortunate that much basic pain research has , until recently , been done in male animals			2
although men were more inclined to give themselves the benefit of the doubt , the majority , 54 per cent , still agreed ‘ women ’ were more stoical males do n’t menstruate or go on heat , which makes them simpler and cheaper to study			2
but it also means we have been developing and testing drugs on males , assuming that they will work just as well on females , which may not be the case			0
we ’ve come to realise , for example , paracetamol works better on men , while some opioids work better on women			0
we do n’t , however , know why			0
that situation is now changing as researchers involve more females and start actively looking for differences			0
indeed , @entity305 imagines a future where pharmaceutical companies produce pain - killing drugs that are specific to one gender			1
so perhaps we ’ll have pink painkillers for women , and blue ones for boys , each honed to work on the specific male or female brain			1
‘ if that happens , ’ says @entity305 , ‘ that ’ll be a first in medicine			0
’ it may also mean far more effective medication for all of us			0
head injury , a leading cause of death and disability in young people , is another area where studying gender differences could bring significant benefits			2
is your brain male or female ? documentary premieres on @entity87 on monday at 7.30pm a couple of years ago , i was in a large military hospital in @entity384 , filming a series called @entity386 for the @entity387			1
i saw a number of soldiers , male and female , with serious head injuries			1
i was told that the women were likely to make a better recovery than the men			0
why ? it may be , in part , because women have higher levels of progesterone			0
progesterone is best known as a female hormone , involved in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy , but it is also important for the development of neurones — the cells that carry messages in the brain			1
animal studies and a few small human trials have shown that giving progesterone soon after suffering a brain injury improves survival and recovery			1
larger studies , some of them funded by the military , are currently underway			2
this , i think , is why researching gender differences is worth doing			2
it is not because it will help us understand why men struggle to remember their children ’s birthdays or why there are fewer female darts players , but because it may help us find more effective ways to tackle disease			2
is your brain male or female ? documentary premieres on @entity87 on monday at 7.30pm tests extracted from a quiz at bbc.co.uk / science / humanbody / sex , devised in conjunction with dr @entity129			1

a person **'s** brain often reflects their gender . however their hands can also indicate if their brain is more female or male
why are some skills or characteristics considered male or female - specific ?
documentary examines if gender - specific traits are *due* to biology ( occuring from birth ) or develop as a result of *environment*
the film examines different *theories* and studies about gender and the brain
study says fingers can indicate how much testosterone is in a person **'s** body
