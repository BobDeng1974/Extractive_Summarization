i believe that all of the participants were deeply moved by this emotional , raw and true ' piece of art '			0

all set : @entity10 is now terrified of the media attention but her painter - artist husband @entity56 spoke briefly wednesday she said : ' we first received notice that the baby was coming soon at 9.34am and rushed to the quaint gallery			1
' although we were one of the select few to attend the live birth , an art performance / installation by @entity10 , we , unfortunately , did n't arrive in time			2
' what we did find when we entered the steamy space , which the artist converted into a birthing centre , was @entity10 calmly eating a banana , the placenta in a bowl and the baby 's father , @entity71 , holding his son who was wrapped in a blue towel			1
' the beautiful baby boy was wide - eyed , and as quiet as could be , staring blankly into the camera and video lenses that hovered above him			1
' a video of the birth will be added to forthcoming exhibition at the gallery , and forms the start of an 18 year project which called @entity84 , where @entity10 will document her child 's upbringing until college with weekly video podcasts			1
