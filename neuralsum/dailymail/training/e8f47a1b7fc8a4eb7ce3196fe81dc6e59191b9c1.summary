by @entity0 published : 19:47 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 04:07 est , 15 december 2012 its catchprase is ‘ more reasons to shop at @entity4 ’			0
but animal lovers have fewer reasons to shop there following the supermarket ’s festive advert featuring a child feeding @entity11 to the family dog			1
vets warned that dried fruit in the cake could cause acute renal failure and death in dogs if left untreated and branded the supermarket ‘ irresponsible ’ for showing the advert			1
campaigners have now set up a @entity23 page and have complained to the @entity24 about the advert , saying it encourages people to feed @entity11 pudding to dogs			1
scroll down to watch video ' not everyone loves traditional @entity11 pud ' : a child in the @entity4 advert looks suspiciously at some @entity11 pudding placed on his plate sneaky : when no one is looking , the child lifts up the @entity11 pudding and starts to lower it beneath the table the 20 - second clip shows a young boy being handed a plate with a slice of the pudding that he then passes to his little brother who then passes it to the family dog under the table			1
the advert , which showcases @entity4 ’ alternative @entity11 desserts , features the voiceover saying : ‘ not everyone loves traditional @entity11 pud ’			2
although the dog deposits the @entity11 pudding in the plant pot , the advert suggests that dogs can eat the dessert , despite the dangers which are well - known to dog - lovers , according to campaigners			1
@entity64 , veterinary director of the @entity65 , said any advert that suggested feeding @entity11 pudding to dogs was ‘ irresponsible ’			1
she said : ‘ we do n’t know exactly why it is toxic , but if dogs eat dried fruit they will suffer vomiting , diarrhoea , weakness and lethargy and eventually acute renal failure if it is n’t treated			1
‘ there ’s always a risk around @entity11 time with @entity11 puddings , @entity11 cake and chocolate			2
@entity11 is a bit of a minefield for dogs			2
‘ if you do think your dog has consumed dried fruit , you need to seek immediate veterinary attention			2
the vet may then induce vomiting in the dog to get rid of the food before they absorb it			0
going , going , gone : the child successfully manages to hide the pudding underneath the table warning : vets and animal charities are unhappy that the advert shows the boy handing the pudding to a dog as dried fruit is toxic to animals ‘ the bottom line is that dried fruits are very , very toxic and they could end up costing you your dog ’s life			1
’ she warned owners not to feed their pets raisins , sultanas , currants , dates , grapes , mince pies , @entity11 pudding , alcohol , onion , raw green potato , turkey ( or any other ) bones and chocolate			1
@entity124 , editor of @entity125 ( all @entity126 ) , said her readers had been outraged the moment they saw the advert and demanded @entity4 stop showing the advert and apologise			0
she said : ‘ we received a number of complaints about the advert the minute it aired			0
‘ everyone knows about the danger of giving dogs chocolate but i ’m not sure that people know the dangers of the dried fruit in christmas pudding			1
‘ all you need is a child to watch it , to give the pudding to a less fussy dog than the one in the advert and the animal could suffer renal failure and die			1
‘ it would have been nice if they had consulted a vet or a welfare group before filming this advert , or even a dog owner as most of them are well aware of the problems with dried fruit			1
’ she said the advert showed a little boy ‘ poisoning ’ his pet dog , adding : ‘ it ’s like giving a dog @entity168			2
it really is that bad			0
’ ' misleading ' : the dog then deposits the @entity11 pudding in a plant pot but campaigners argue the advert makes it seem the dessert is not dangerous to dogs minimal risk : a @entity4 spokesman said that vets advised the supermarket there would be minimal , if any , risks to a dog from eating a small amount of @entity11 pudding critics have now set up a @entity23 page where people can give their opinions on the advert : @entity190 two years ago , @entity191 caused controversy when their @entity11 advert featured a shot of the family dog out in the howling wind and snow in a kennel that was too small for it			1
outraged campaigners said the shots of the wolfhound sitting in the kennel set a bad example to other owners and encouraged animal cruelty			0
the company apologised and cut the clip from some of their adverts			0
morrisons are continuing to show the advert			0
ms @entity124 added : ‘ @entity191 got it in the neck for what their @entity11 advert about the dog			2
it set animal welfare back about 50 years because everyone thought that if it ’s ok for @entity191 , it ’s ok for everyone			0
‘ by the same logic , @entity4 are telling us that children who do n’t like @entity11 pudding should give it to the dog			2
’ @entity229 , president of the @entity230 , said : ‘ it is vital that advertisers use animals responsibly and we are disappointed to see the @entity11 desserts tv commercial depicting a small boy feeding @entity11 pudding to his dog			1
‘ @entity11 pudding , @entity11 cake and mince pies - because they contain raisins or sultanas - are potentially harmful to pets and in some cases can lead to kidney failure			1
controversial : meanwhile , @entity247 's offering has drawn more than 1,000 complaints saying it is sexist because the mother does most of the preparations long suffering : the mother buys all the presents , while the father is largely absent in the @entity247 advert ‘ while we accept that many pet owners understand what is and what is not appropriate to feed their pets , children watch adverts and can be easily influenced by what they see			1
‘ veterinary organisations and animal welfare charities work really hard to promote messages about responsible pet ownership and tv adverts such as this one , with huge audiences , can undermine this work			0
’ so far , 40 people have complained to the @entity24 about the @entity273 - lover @entity272 posted a comment on the @entity23 page saying : ‘ my grandchildren ( 3 , 3 and 6 ) constantly copy things they see on the tv , particularly the little ones			0
‘ as we ca n’t watch them 24/7 i feel this is incredibly irresponsible of @entity4			0
‘ had they put their hands up to it straight away i would forgive sloppy research , but to continue with the ad is arrogance personified			0
’ @entity288 said : ‘ imagine the advert said some people do n’t like @entity291 and showed @entity292 handing a glass of the horrible stuff to the toddler who then pours it into a plant pot.			0
. ’ a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ we know that many of our customers are dog lovers and we would never run any advert that encouraged poor pet care			0
‘ we were therefore careful to seek veterinary advice prior to filming the advert and ensured we had a vet present during filming			0
‘ the veterinary advice we received concluded that there would be minimal , if any , risk to a dog of serious toxic reaction should a small amount , in relation to its body weight , of @entity11 cake or pudding be consumed on a one - off basis			2
’ the spokesman added that the advice was that there would only be a risk of toxicity if a dog ate raw fruits weighing 1 - 2.5lbs - a figure that vets said was inaccurate			0
