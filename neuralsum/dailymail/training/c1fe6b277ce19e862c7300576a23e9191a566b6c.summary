the @entity0 is collecting data from thousands of cellphones through high - tech gear deployed on airplanes that mimics communications towers , the @entity6 reported thursday that the hunt for information about criminal suspects is also collecting data from many innocent @entity11			1
citing sources familiar with the operations , the newspaper said the @entity16 's service program , which became fully operational in 2007 , operates @entity18 aircraft from at least five metropolitan - area airports , selected as they cover most of the @entity11 population , to collect the data			1
operation : according to sources , the @entity16 's service program operates @entity18 aircraft from at least five metropolitan - area airports , selected as they cover most of the @entity11 population , to collect the data the airports were not identified in the @entity6 story			1
the planes are equipped with devices called ' dirtboxes , ' that mimic cell towers of large telecommunications firms and trick cellphones into reporting unique registration information			1
the two - foot - square devices allow investigators to collect data from thousands of cellphones in a single flight , the @entity6 reported			1
the devices collect their identifying information and general location			2
the @entity0 would neither confirm nor deny the existence of such a program to the @entity6			0
an official told the newspaper that discussion of such matters would allow criminal suspects of foreign powers to determine @entity16 surveillance capabilities , adding that @entity0 agencies comply with federal law , including by seeking court approval			0
calling it ' a dragnet surveillance program , ' @entity51 , chief technologist at the @entity52 , said : ' it 's inexcusable and it 's likely — to the extent judges are authorizing it — they have no idea of the scale of it			0
' no comment : the @entity0 would neither confirm nor deny the existence of such a program the device being used by the @entity16 identifies itself as having the closest , strongest signal — though it does n't — and causes all the cellphones that can detect its signal to send in their unique registration information			1
cellphones are programmed to connect automatically to the strongest cell tower signal			2
phone companies are cut out in the search for suspects			0
law enforcement has found that asking a company for cell - tower information to help locate a suspect can be slow and inaccurate			2
this program allows the government to get that information itself			0
people familiar with the program told the @entity6 they do get court orders to search for phones , but it is n't clear whether those orders describe the methods used because the orders are sealed .			0

a @entity91 collecting data became operational in 2007
the agency operates @entity18 aircraft from five major airports
locations are chosen because they cover most of the @entity11 population
