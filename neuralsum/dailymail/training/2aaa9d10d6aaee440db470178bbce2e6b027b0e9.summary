craters from a double asteroid strike , described as ' one of the largest cosmic catastrophes ' in the history of the solar system , have been uncovered in @entity6			1
the rare event took place around 458 million years ago , as a result of a mighty collision in the asteroid belt around 12 million years earlier			0
@entity12 claims that if an asteroid was found to be on a collision course with @entity16 , there is a 15 per cent chance that it will be accompanied by a partner			1
craters from a double asteroid strike , described as ' one of the largest cosmic catastrophes ' in the history of the solar system , have been uncovered in @entity6			1
a team , led by @entity23 of the @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , carried out drilling into the craters , looking for traces of sediment altered by impact shock the ancient smash - up occurred after a 120 - mile ( 200km ) asteroid broke up , scattering large chunks of rock , which later crossed @entity16 's orbit			1
two of these pieces slammed into shallow seas that covered modern - day @entity39 , according to the study			0
with uplift of the @entity16 's crust , the signature of that event lies in central @entity6 - the 4.7 mile ( 7.5km ) @entity47 crater , located around 12.4 miles ( 20 km ) south of the city of @entity49 , and a 0.4 miles ( 700 metre ) crater at nearby @entity50			1
the study , published in the journal @entity53 , backs long - standing suspicions that these craters , just 9.9 miles ( 16 km ) apart , were caused by a ' doublet ' , an extremely rare double whammy caused by asteroids travelling in pairs			2
if an asteroid was found to be heading for @entity16 , there is a 15 per cent chance it will be come as a pair			2
however , few impact ' doublet craters on @entity16 have been found			2
pictured is an artist 's impression of a doublet it is thought that nearly 15 per cent of all asteroids travel in pairs , yet very few impact craters on @entity16 have been found as ' doublets '			1
asteroids can hit @entity16 in pairs - or what scientists describe as ' doublets '			0
these double asteroids are thought to form when a ' rubble pile ' asteroid begins to spin rapidly under the influence of sunlight			2
this causes the loose rock to be thrown out from the object 's equator to form a small moon			0
it is thought that nearly 15 per cent of all asteroids travel in pairs , but very few impact craters on @entity16 have been found as ' doublets '			1
only a small fraction of the binaries that hit the @entity16 will have the required separation between the asteroid and its moon to produce different craters			0
as well as @entity6 , double impact craters have been found in @entity101 and @entity102 in @entity103 , @entity104 ; @entity105 and @entity106 in southern @entity107 ; and @entity108 and @entity109 in southern @entity110			2
the team , led by @entity23 of the @entity112 in @entity25 , @entity26 , carried out drilling into the craters , looking for traces of sediment altered by impact shock			1
they also mapped the halo of ejecta - a ring of debris hurled up by the smash , which landed up to tens of miles away from the inner crater			1
the @entity127 impact was created by an object about 1,960ft ( 600 metres ) long , while the @entity50 impactor was about 490ft ( 150 metres ) long , the experts said			0
they were so - called ' rubble pile ' asteroids , or fragments travelling in a cluster			0
' @entity134 ' are a debated area of astrophysics			0
modelling of asteroids that come close to @entity16 suggest that about 16 per cent of these objects travel in pairs			2
but of the 188 known craters on @entity16 , only 10 - in @entity104 , @entity107 , @entity110 , @entity141 and @entity142 - are considered to be serious candidates as doublets			0
the twin impact 458 million years ago would be part of a ' shower ' of meteors that pummelled @entity16 after the big breakup in the main asteroid belt			0
some experts theorise that this had dramatic consequences for @entity16 's climate and ecosystems , encouraging an explosion in species called @entity160 event			0
the signature of the event lies in central @entity6 - the 4.7 mile ( 7.5km ) @entity47 crater , located around 12.4 miles ( 20 km ) south of the city of @entity49 , and a 0.4 miles ( 700 metre ) crater at nearby @entity50			1

craters from the double asteroid strike were found in central @entity6
event was ' one of the largest cosmic catastrophes ' in the solar system
@entity26 team drilled into craters , looking sediment altered by impact
they mapped halo of ejecta - a ring of debris hurled up by the smash
this revealed that craters were created by the same ' doublet ' impact
@entity12 says that nearly 15 per cent of all asteroids travel with a partner
