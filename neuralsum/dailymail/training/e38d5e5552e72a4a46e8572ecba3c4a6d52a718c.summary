by @entity0 published : 09:51 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 19:33 est , 17 october 2012 a lost squadron of spitfires that has been buried in the @entity4 jungle since the end of the @entity6 is to be dug up and brought back to @entity7			1
aircraft enthusiast @entity8 spent 15 years and £ 130,000 of his own money tracking down the aircraft			1
up to 60 planes were buried in transport crates at a secret location 40ft below ground at the end of the war to ensure they did n’t fall into enemy hands			1
@entity8 , from @entity20 , discovered 20 spitfires buried in crates in @entity4 - and they will now be excavated for display saved for posterity : at least 60 spitfires are believed to be buried - and they will hopefully be proudly displayed once again thanks to the 16 - year hunt the spitfires are believed to be in good condition because they were waxed , wrapped in greased paper and had their joints tarred by @entity32 crews			1
the excavation is due to start at the end of the month after an agreement was signed with the military regime in @entity37			0
mr @entity8 , 62 , a farmer from @entity38 , @entity20 , started his treasure hunt in 1996 after hearing a throwaway remark from a group of @entity43 veterans who said they once buried spitfires in @entity4			1
the fighter planes – of which there are only around 35 left flying in the world – were shipped to @entity4 and transported by rail to a @entity7 @entity32 base in august 1945			1
but they were deemed surplus to requirements and unsuited to the ‘ island - hopping ’ missions to clear the @entity54 of their remaining strongholds in the @entity56			0
mr @entity8 tracked down an eyewitness who led him to the area where the aircraft were buried			1
he eventually located the buried planes using ground - penetrating radar equipment			2
his team dug a borehole and sent down a camera to look at the crates , which were said to be in ‘ really good condition ’			1
one of the @entity44 ( pictured : the tail fins ) being crated up in @entity4 in 1945 ready to be buried images showed the @entity44 inside the containers with their wings packed alongside them			1
the planes will now be dug up and brought back to the @entity7 to be reassembled			0
a @entity74 spokesman said : ‘ we hope that many of them will soon be gracing the skies of @entity7			0
’ the deal went ahead after prime minister @entity80 signed a heritage agreement with @entity4 president @entity82 during his visit to the south - east @entity85 nation in april			2
the excavation agreement was signed on tuesday by mr @entity8 , @entity4 's civil aviation chief @entity87 and the @entity89 company boss @entity90 , mr @entity8 's partner in the country mr @entity93 said : ' this will be the largest number of @entity44 in the world			1
we want to let people see those historic fighters			0
' mr @entity8 's treasure hunt was sparked in 1996 by a throwaway remark from a group of @entity43 veterans who said they had once buried @entity44 in the @entity4 jungle			1
the @entity44 , of which there are only around 35 flying left in the world , were shipped to @entity4 and transported by rail to the @entity7 @entity32 base in august 1945			2
a place in history : a poster unveiling the @entity44 from around 1939 mr @entity8 , from @entity38 , @entity20 , persuaded the country 's notoriously secretive regime to allow him to search for the lost aircraft , winning their trust over 12 visits			2
the married father - of - three doggedly pieced together their possible location by speaking to the declining number of @entity121 veterans he said at the time : ' i ’m only a small farmer , i ’m not a multi-millionaire and it has been a struggle			0
it took me more than 15 years but i finally found them			0
' spitfires are beautiful aeroplanes and should not be rotting away in a foreign land			0
they saved our neck in the @entity134 and they should be preserved			0
' permission to excavate the planes was granted because of the strengthening relations between @entity138 and @entity37			0
in the past year , @entity4 has turned away from the repressive policies of the previous military regime and has taken a reforming democratic stance			2
a @entity74 spokesman said : ' we hope that many of them will be gracing the skies of @entity7 and as discussed , some will be displayed here in @entity4			2
' mr @entity8 said the government had promised him it would not be making a claim for the aircraft			0
a law passed by the @entity7 when they granted @entity4 independence in 1948 meant that anything left behind automatically became the property of the @entity4 government			0
mr @entity8 is understood to have struck a deal with the @entity4 president to take 60 per cent of the profits .			1

farmer @entity8 explored @entity4 for nearly two *decades* to find where the planes were buried in crates
spitfires believed to be in good condition due to *careful* containment
