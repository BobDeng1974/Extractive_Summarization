cyborgs are no longer just a part of 1970s science fiction plots about galaxies far , far away			0
the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) has given its approval for one company to sell prosthetic arms that are controlled by electrical signals			1
the @entity9 is nicknamed the ‘ @entity11 ’ arm as it was inspired by @entity11 ’s robotic arm in @entity13			1
its electrodes are attached to the muscles of a wearer and detect electrical activity caused by the contraction of muscles close to where the prosthesis is attached			2
the electrodes transmit signals to a computer processor in the prosthesis , which translates these signals into 10 different types of movements			2
the arm contains a combination of mechanisms including switches , movement sensors , and force sensors that enables it to move			0
it can translate the electrical signals into 10 different types of movements , which enable wearers to perform more complex and delicate tasks			1
the character played by @entity64 was fitted with the mind - controlled prosthetic after @entity67 cut his hand off with a lightsaber			0
the @entity27 arm can perform multiple , simultaneous powered movements controlled by electrical signals from electromyogram ( @entity31 ) electrodes connected to the wearer 's muscles			1
and now the @entity76 , @entity77 - based company behind the innovation has got the go - ahead to sell its bionic arms to members of the public , although prices are not yet available			1
the arm is designed so that people can perform delicate tasks like picking up eggs , which they would find incredibly difficult with current prostheses			2
its electrodes are attached to the muscles of a wearer and detect electrical activity caused by the contraction of muscles close to where the prosthesis is attached			2
electrodes transmit signals to a computer processor in the prosthesis , which translates them into 10 different types of movements			0
the arm is the same shape and weight as an adult ’s and contains a combination of mechanisms including switches , movement sensors , and force sensors that enables it to move			0
the prosthesis has been nicknamed the ' @entity114 ' after @entity11 's bionic arm ( pictured ) in the @entity13 films			1
like hr @entity119 arm , the @entity27 prosthesis allows its wearer a lot of dexterity and contains a combination of mechanisms including switches , movement sensors , and force sensors that enables it to move ms @entity127 said : ‘ this innovative prosthesis provides a new option for people with certain kinds of arm amputations			0
’ the @entity4 studied how the prosthesis coped with common household and self - care tasks and found that 90 per cent of users were able to perform jobs that they were unable to do with their current prosthesis , such as using keys and locks , preparing food , feeding themselves , using zips , and brushing hair			1
the company , which was founded by @entity153 , who was one of the inventors of the @entity155 , said that the @entity27 system can be adapted for people with limb loss at the shoulder , mid upper arm and mid lower arm , but at the moment it can not be adapted for limb loss at the elbow or wrist			0
the product was part funded by the @entity162 ( @entity162 ) .			0

@entity9 is *affectionately* nicknamed the ‘ @entity11 ’ arm as it was inspired by @entity11 ’s robotic hand in @entity13
@entity167 can perform multiple powered movements controlled by electrical signals from electrodes connected to the wearer 's muscles
nine in 10 users were able to perform tasks that they were unable to do with their current prosthesis , such as picking up eggs and brushing hair
the @entity77 - based company has now got the go - ahead to sell its bionic arms to members of the public
