by @entity0 published : 16:35 est , 4 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:54 est , 5 december 2013 they have been spoiled for goalscorers down the years at @entity5 , but even those fortunate enough to have lived through the @entity6 and @entity7 years will seldom have seen anything to match an attacking masterclass from @entity10 on wednesday night			1
there were supposed to be cracks appearing in the @entity14 push for a @entity16 return after a recent dip in form , culminating in a widely and fiercely criticised defeat at @entity20 on sunday			0
instead , the cracks were in @entity22 's defence and how @entity10 exploited them with a 19 - minute hat - trick that earned him a standing ovation at half - time and another when he reappeared for the second half			1
video : scroll down to see @entity28 praising @entity10 as one of the world 's greatest strikers screamer : @entity10 opens the scoring at @entity5 against @entity22 with a stunning volley from 40 - yards celebration : the @entity37 wheels away jubilantly , and that would n't be the last time , either ... not again : it was a tough night for @entity22 ' keeper @entity40 who must be sick of the sight of the striker @entity14 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity44 6 ; @entity45 7 , @entity46 6 , @entity47 6 , @entity48 6 ; @entity49 6 ( @entity50 69 ) , @entity51 6 , @entity52 7 , @entity53 6 ; @entity54 7 ; @entity10 9 ( @entity55 90 )			1

* @entity86 ratings by @entity0 at anfield still he was n't finished , as he curled home an unstoppable 74th - minute free - kick to make it 11 goals in his last four appearances then revealed a less heralded string to his bow by laying on a fifth for @entity53			1
they still chant @entity7 's name on the @entity97 and still serenade @entity6 for the four goals he put past @entity99 at @entity100 back in november 1982			0
the way @entity10 is going , his place in their affections will prove just as enduring			2
an outrageous dipping volley rom 40 yards , razor - sharp close - range finish from a corner and unerring half - volley from the edge of the area combined to reignite @entity14 's supposedly faltering top - four challenge and leave @entity22 nursing a persecution complex			1
@entity28 describes his prolific frontrunner as a delight to work with but he 's a statistician 's dream as well , as @entity22 will readily testify after being on the receiving end once more			2
he left the field with the match ball after becoming the first player in @entity122 history to score three hat - tricks against the same team , @entity22 , while all six of his open - play goals from outside the box have also all come against the hapless @entity22			1
it has taken him just 86 appearances to reach 50 @entity122 goals , while his current 13 - goal tally for this season is one more than the whole @entity22 side have managed between them			1
little wonder @entity28 compared him to @entity138 and @entity139 , as he sent a chilling message to @entity122 defences that he has yet to reach his peak			2
at the double : @entity10 notches his second , but not his last , as he steels in front of @entity63 support : a @entity37 flag is seen in the crowd above as @entity10 celebrates scoring his second the distance from which @entity10 scored his fantastic first goal is shown on the brilliant match zone @entity10 is the first player in @entity122 history to score three hat - tricks against the same team ( @entity22 )			1
all six of @entity10 's open play goals from outside the box in the @entity122 have come against @entity22			1
50 - @entity10 has reached 50 @entity122 goals in just 86 appearances			1
@entity10 now has more goals ( 13 ) than @entity160 , @entity20 and @entity161 ( 12 ) , as well as @entity22 and @entity162 ( 11 ) this season			1

' smiled the @entity14 manager			1
' i have n't seen many individual performances like that before			0
it was a joy to watch , sheer brilliance from one of the best strikers in the world			0
among modern - day world - class operators like @entity138 and @entity139 , it 's all about numbers			0
they do n't seem to deal in ones and twos any more			0
it 's all fours and fives , and , of course , @entity10 has shown he can do that			2
' he is the happiest he has been in all his time here , and that is adding a maturity to his play			0
it goes hand in glove with him , and i am convinced his best years are going to be spent here			0
' the football we are playing is allowing him to exploit the spaces he likes playing in , and the way he is finishing things off deserves mention alongside @entity138 and @entity139			0
he is only 26 and is going to keep improving			0
the quality of his finishing was just incredible , and i actually felt sorry for @entity22 's defenders , because there 's not much you can do about it			2
' you would have to toss a coin between the first and third for hew pick of the bunch , initially , i thought the opener , but then i looked at the third again and just thought , " goodness me , what a goal that was			0
" it was a remarkable individual performance			0
' world class : the forward converts in fine fashion yet again to seal his hat - trick ... his third against @entity22 not much he can do : @entity40 sits on the deck as @entity10 is congratulated by his @entity14 team - mates @entity10 is in danger of monopolising goal of the season this year after the way he eased past @entity235 's @entity234 at the top of the @entity122 scoring charts			1
his first entry came in the 16th minute when , after @entity239 missed an attempt to intercept a firm forward header from @entity52 , he advanced a couple of paces before putting every last pounce of effort into a 40 - yard volley that flew over a startled @entity40 and into the net			1
if his second , 13 minutes later , was less eye - catching , it still said everything about his predatory instinct near goal , as he lashed a waist - high volley into the roof of the net , from a @entity54 corner , before anyone else could react			1
inevitable : he curls in a fantastic fourth inevitable : he curls in a fantastic fourth records : @entity10 is just the third man to score a first - half hat - trick in the @entity122 when the hat - trick goal arrived , there was almost an air of inevitability about it , exceptional though it was			1
advancing towards the 18 - yard line with the ball bouncing in front of him , he sensed the impending arrival of @entity239 on his right and responded by juggling it over him before hitting the crispest of half - volleys			2
the vantage point from the press box is sideways on , rather than behind the line , yet there was a feeling of absolute certainty that the ball was bound for the corner of @entity40 's net , where it duly ended up , to jubilant roars from all corners of this famous old venue			0
they 've seen a few sights in their time , but nothing quite like this			0
quick : @entity53 was involved in a dynamic front three for the hosts , and he rounded off proceedings ( below ) quick : @entity53 was involved in a dynamic front three for the hosts , and he rounded off proceedings ( below ) thumbs up : @entity28 could n't have been happier with the first - half blitz			2

@entity10 scores four goals at @entity5 to take his tally to 13 for the season
he becomes first in @entity122 to net three hat - tricks against one club
his first half hat - trick also *included* a volley from 40 yards
@entity45 grabs late strike for @entity22 before @entity53 goal
