by @entity1 reporter @entity2 appears like a city in the clouds in this stunning photograph taken by a passenger from his plane window			1
plane enthusiast and amateur photographer @entity8 captured the jaw - dropping scene of the city silhouetted in @entity12 from his seat on a @entity2 - bound flight making its final approach			1
the late - afternoon image shows the low sun casting a golden glow on the water , which is visible beneath cloud cover			2
stunning : @entity2 appears like a kingdom in the clouds in this picture taken by plan passenger @entity8 of the city silhouette reflected on @entity12 the buildings of the @entity27 cast long shadows out into the water - while closer inspection reveals another passenger jet near the centre of the picture			1
@entity8 said the image is straight out of the camera , without use of image manipulation			1
' i was flying home to @entity2 from a business trip recently , ' he said			2
' it was a cloudy day , late in the afternoon			2
we were flying eastbound , made a pass by @entity43 , then made a sweeping 180 - degree left turn over @entity12 for our final westward approach into the airport			0
@entity2 , as seen from closer to ground level , was captured from an unusual angle through a break in the clouds by @entity8 @entity51 : the stunning picture of @entity2 's skyscrapers , left , reflected onto @entity12 was taken by @entity8 , right , on his @entity54 ' i looked down and through a narrow break in the clouds , i saw the shadow of the @entity2 skyline projecting onto the lake			1
oddly enough , i am a very frequent flyer and almost always sit in an aisle set , but on this flight there were only window seats available			1
' i grabbed my @entity54 and snapped off a single shot , hoping i captured the scene			0
when i got home i opened the photo on my computer			0
not only was i amazed at the shot , but i noticed i also captured another plane on a parallel approach - which you can see if you look closely at the clouds above the skyline in the centre of the image			0
' my only regret is that the image is not as sharp as i would like ; it 's merely an @entity54 capture , after all			0
ironically , i am an avid amateur photography enthusiast , with some pretty expensive pro equipment			0
