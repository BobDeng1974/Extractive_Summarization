experts say the move could signal a focus on business users rather than consumers for the firm , which has faced aggressive competition from @entity14 and @entity15 for its software			2
@entity3 's board has taken five - months to search for a new boss to replace @entity19 as head of the world 's largest software company before turning to the 22 year veteran			2
@entity3 has officially named cloud - computing executive @entity5 , pictured , as its new ceo			1
@entity5 , who has spent 22 years at the firm and was previously in charge of the tech giant 's cloud software and services division , will replace exiting ceo @entity19 @entity5 , a native of @entity30 , @entity31 - where @entity3 has its largest non- @entity33 research center - was promoted to run the company 's fast - expanding cloud , or internet - based , computing initiatives in july last year			1
born in 1967 and educated in @entity31 and the @entity33 , @entity5 's tech career started at internet software pioneer @entity38			2

he was promoted to run the company 's server and tools unit in 2011			0
as part of the move , co-founder @entity48 may step aside as chairman and be replaced by lead independent director @entity52 , said the source , speaking on condition of anonymity because the process is private			1

@entity59 first reported the news on thursday			0
rising star @entity5 , a native of @entity30 , @entity31 - where @entity3 has its largest non- @entity33 research center - was promoted to run the company 's fast - expanding cloud , or internet - based , computing initiatives in july last year as part of current ceo @entity19 's radical re-organization of the company			1
the appointment of the 22 - year @entity3 veteran would make him the most powerful @entity31 - born tech executive in the world and put him alongside @entity73 's chief , @entity72 , as the leader of a well - known , large - cap @entity33 corporation			0
born in 1967 and educated in @entity31 and the @entity33 , @entity5 's tech career started at internet software pioneer @entity38			2
he joined @entity3 in 1992 and quickly climbed the corporate ladder with leading roles in the @entity42 and @entity44 search - engine teams			0
he was promoted to run the company 's server and tools unit in 2011			0
that unit now forms the backbone of @entity3 's cloud - computing platform , which @entity5 runs under his official title of executive vice president , cloud and enterprise			1
' he 's a solid choice , ' offering continuity of strategy and proven execution , said @entity95 , an analyst at fund firm @entity96			0
some investors had campaigned for an external ceo who might be more likely to shake up the company and reward shareholders with greater dividends and share buybacks , but @entity95 said that did not mean @entity5 would be unpopular with @entity103			2
' any new ceo is going to have to have the shareholders ' say in mind			0
but it 's not certain that will translate into actions , ' said @entity95			0
experts say the move could see a more business focus , rather than a consumer focus which some said could have seen @entity3 spin off its @entity117 division if @entity5 is named ceo , it is likely @entity52 will help out on the crucial task of managing @entity3 's relations with its powerful @entity103 investors , the source said			1
@entity5 has little experience of that aspect of the job , and @entity19 and @entity48 did not prioritize it			1
@entity48 would likely focus on technical innovation in any new role , the source said			2
there have been calls for months for @entity48 to step down from investors who believe @entity3 's co-founder is a block to radical change and investor - friendly moves			1
@entity19 , who plans to retire as soon as a new ceo is named , was reelected to the board in november , but it is not clear how long he will remain there after retirement , the source said			0
several people briefed on the ceo search process had previously told @entity143 that @entity3 was down to a handful of candidates , including @entity5 and @entity146 , executive vice-president of business development , plus at least one external candidate			2
the board still has not met to finalize @entity5 's offer and nothing has been signed , the source said			0
@entity3 shares rose 0.8 percent to $ 37.15 after hours , after gaining slightly in regular @entity155 trading			0
@entity156 founder @entity48 , pictured , also announced he is leaving his role as chairman to become technology adviser , and board member @entity52 will take his place			1
there have been calls for months for @entity48 to step down from investors who believe @entity3 's co-founder is a block to radical change @entity3 's ceo search has taken longer than most expected when @entity19 said last august he would retire within a year			1
in a blog post on the company 's website in december , @entity52 emphasized the need for a ceo with ' an ability to lead a highly technical organization and work with top technical talent '			0
@entity52 , who leads the four - member ceo search committee , said at the time he expected the panel to reach a decision ' in the early part of 2014 '			0
the appointment of a company veteran like @entity5 , which follows a flirtation with outsiders such as @entity185 chief executive @entity184 , could disappoint some investors who want a more radical transformation at the software giant			0
' while many on the @entity103 are now expecting mr. @entity5 to get the ceo spot , we believe filling this position with a core @entity3 insider will disappoint those hoping for a fresh strategic approach ( e.g. potential breakup of enterprise / consumer , @entity117 spin off ) an outside executive could have brought to the table , ' @entity190 analyst @entity189 said in a research note , adding that innovation and fresh strategies were needed			1
' with that said , we believe mr. @entity5 's prior roles in the @entity206 , @entity207 and most recently as president of the @entity210 business position him as a strong internal candidate with a broad set of knowledge around @entity3 's massive product portfolio , ' @entity189 wrote .			1
