but with a touch of imagination , a few props and a handful of images , one photographer shows how unsightly potholes can be transformed into works of art. @entity14 has used the huge gaps in the concrete for a variety of scenes , including a deep fat fryer , a swimming pool and a spaghetti bowl			1
a photographer , based in @entity23 , has been inspired to create quirky images with potholes after he damaged his car when he ran over one			1
pictured is a diver diving into a ' swimming pool ' pothole off a makeshift board a baywatch babe runs towards a pothole to save a person whose hand looms out from the water a model washes clothes and kitchen appliances in a pothole designed to look like a washbasin @entity14 then used models to create quirky scenarios , such as a fisherman reeling in a catch and a lifeguard saving a person from drowning			1
some of the images even depict people using the potholes to wash clothes , chill champagne , go scuba diving , plant flowers and crush berries			2
@entity14 filled the potholes with real props and only used computer software programme @entity55 to alter some of the colours			1
his amusing pictures now sell for nearly Â£ 800 for a set of nine			2
@entity14 , 34 , from @entity23 , said : ' the idea came to life after i had sudden collision with a canyon sized crater of a pothole			1
a fisherman in @entity68 catches a fish in a pothole disguised as a pond a man uses one pothole to make his own wine , stamping on grapes in a hole to get the juice tasty : in one image a pothole transforms into a bowl which a man enjoys eating spaghetti and meatballs from ' i decided to channel my frustration into a positive project where the useless pothole would be a source of humour and creativity			2
' i attempted to visualise and incorporate potholes as everyday props and the project started as a humorous way to expose the ridiculous pothole problem			0
' after creating a scene on paper , i scoured the city and located the appropriate pothole for each photograph			0
the images were shot in @entity23 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			0
pretty makeover : a gardener makes use of the holes in the ground by filling them with soil and plants champagne and strawberries : three girls enjoy several bottles of bubbly , chilled in an ice bucket created from a pothole @entity118 chases after a rabbit which is about to jump into a very large black hole ' i do n't use @entity55 to create the image or add props , i only use it for colour correction			0
' seeing people 's reactions to my work is wonderful , mostly smiles and laughter			0
' they are astonished to hear that i do not photoshop the props into the scenes , but that everything is actually set in and around the pothole			0
