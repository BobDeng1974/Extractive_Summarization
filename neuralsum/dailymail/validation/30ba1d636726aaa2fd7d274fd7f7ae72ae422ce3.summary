in seven years as @entity1 boss @entity0 was never once distracted by the lure of its famous casino			1
' i spent a lot of time on the football pitches , i do n't think anyone saw me in there , ' said @entity0 , as he arrived at the @entity11 on monday night , aware that on his first competitive return to @entity13 he will be expected to gamble			1
@entity14 paid the price for taking risks in the first leg and lost 3 - 1			1
as a result history is stacked against them			0
in the @entity22 era , no team has overturned a deficit of two or more goals having played at home first			1
@entity0 knows he will be expected to gamble when he returns to @entity1 for tuesday night 's match @entity14 manager @entity0 walks on the pitch at the @entity11 on monday night ahead of their match @entity14 will have to shine if they are to reverse the 3 - 1 deficit to reach the @entity22 quarter - finals @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 ( from left to right ) pictured during training on monday @entity39 back into the @entity22 and @entity40 were the last to manage it , when they needed a play - off to beat @entity43 in 1969			1
@entity0 was still playing for @entity44 in the @entity46 third division back then , and @entity1 manager @entity47 was not yet born			1
' the statistics are against us , we are conscious of that , ' said the @entity14 boss			1
' we have to give absolutely everything to make the stats lie			0
we believe we can do it and i 'm confident we will			0
if we did n't believe we would n't be here			0
' we totally missed the first leg , which was surprising			2
we did not play well			0
sometimes in life if you miss a chance , you do not have a second chance , but we do , so we will play it fully			0
' but he would not commit to a gung - ho charge from the outset			2
' early goals or late goals but we need full power and must not forget the organisation and structure of the team , ' he added			0
disturbing stats lay behind the headline stat. @entity1 have not lost a @entity76 tie at the @entity11 for 10 years			1
and they have not lost one at home by a score which would knock them out since @entity81 won 3 - 0 here , nearly 20 years ago			1
@entity14 must score three and hope to keep @entity47 's team at bay , something they were unable to do in @entity85			1
@entity0 has no shortage of creative flair at his disposal and backed @entity46 striker @entity89 , who has scored six in seven , to make amends for chances missed at the @entity93			1
it might be easier if @entity1 were not so miserly			2
but this team is built on a stern defence			0
they have conceded only once in the last 12 home games and did not let in a goal in three home @entity22 group games			2
despite all this , @entity14 captain @entity33 echoed the idea that belief in the camp is strong , and has been improved by a team meeting in the aftermath of the first - leg defeat , three weeks ago			1
@entity1 coach @entity47 speaks during his @entity22 press conference on monday @entity47 feels @entity14 still pose a threat even if @entity1 carry a 3 - 1 lead from their first leg win at the @entity93 @entity1 striker @entity113 stretches as he joins the rest of his team - mates for a training session @entity1 train at their base in @entity119 in @entity46 as they prepare for the second leg against @entity14 ' we have a second leg in this competition , thank @entity125 , ' said @entity33			1
' a lot of things went not so well in the first game , especially a few decisions which did not go for us			0
' we know in the first leg we were n't up for it mentally			2
from the start you could feel that there was a bit of pressure and we could n't cope			0
' we feel like after that game we moved on and improved a lot			0
that is why we are confident that even away from home , we can beat any team in the world			0
' obviously we did something wrong to get that result but we can learn			0
we need a good performance			0
it is not going to be easy , but we would like to show a different face			2
' @entity14 vice-captain @entity33 ( right ) joined @entity0 at the press conference on monday ahead of their tie @entity33 echoed @entity0 's idea that belief in the camp is strong despite their 3 - 1 loss in the first leg @entity1 turned on the charm on monday night			1
vice-president @entity158 met @entity0 on his return to @entity11 and presented him with a framed collection of photographs to mark his time at the club			2
@entity0 seemed more concerned about the state of the pitch and went out to inspect , even though his players had trained in @entity167 , earlier in the day			2
he came back with a positive pitch report			0
@entity14 's support in the 18,000 - capacity stadium is expected to be boosted by their @entity46 fan - base , which is another by - product of the @entity0 years , and they can cling to one positive statistic : the @entity174 have not lost in 10 games in @entity46			1
even then , it might not be enough			0
' @entity177 knocked out @entity178 and showed the quality of work being done here in @entity46 , ' @entity1 boss @entity47 warned			2
' who knows , this might be the year when @entity46 beat the @entity167			0
' @entity1 vice-president @entity158 presents @entity0 with a framed collection of photographs on monday @entity0 's seven years in @entity1 saw him deliver the title in 1988 and the @entity188 in 1991 a younger - looking @entity0 celebrates a goal in 1990 as he was given his chance as a young coach in @entity1 @entity0 pictured in 1990 during a training session taken while he was manager of @entity1			1
