by @entity0 published : 18:32 est , 20 january 2013 updated : 03:04 est , 21 january 2013 getting an allotment is supposed to be the start of the ' @entity3 ' - as you begin growing your own cheap and healthy vegetables			1
but the recent surge in popularity of allotments has apparently been accompanied by rocketing disagreements between plotholders			1
and those dreaming of leading an idyllically self - sufficient life should be warned that those ' disagreements ' can even extend from the deliberate sabotage of vegetables , to poisoning in water barrels , and even arson attacks on greenhouses			1
new figures show that getting closer to nature not a guaranteed escape from rivalry and territorial arguments according to the @entity23 , it was called to step in to an astonishing 3,500 disputes last year			1
the rise in rows seems directly linked to the recent growth in popularity of the hobby - sparked by both the recession , soaring supermarket prices and the increasing popularity of homegrown ingredients for cooking - which has led to a cut in size of some council plots			1
and with more allotment holders rubbing shoulders , it seems they are increasingly ready to ball their green fingers into angry fists			2
as well as simply having less space to move in , it seems modern - plot holders are more likely to anger others by erecting huge sheds , or controversial additions such as bee hives			2
all this , on top of the traditional rivalry between gardeners desperate to grow the biggest cauliflower or carrot in the area			2
there are 350,000 allotment - holders in @entity60 - with a record 150,000 more on waiting lists , which can be 40 years long			1
many newcomers to the hobby have been inspired by tv chefs such as @entity66 and @entity67			1
in @entity70 in @entity71 the demand for plots is said to have trebled since 2009			2
as a result the number of tenants has increased from 555 to 814 , with the council said to have cut the size of some plots to accommodate the rise in demand			2
classic seventies show @entity81 starring @entity82 and @entity83 as @entity84 and @entity85 , satirised the many woes of growing your own vegetables problems have been reported nationwide			2
in @entity94 , the chairman of the local allotment holders ' association @entity91 , 70 , told the @entity95 : ' someone who has a grudge against me has been breaking into my shed			0
' they are n't taking anything , they just move things around , as some sort of warning			0
the attacks are n't random , they only go after the chairman and other committee members			1
' mr @entity91 claimed a garden ornament owned by his wife @entity109 had even been moved by his mystery enemies to send him a sinister message			0
' they 've done it just to say , " if we want to get into your shed we can " , ' he said			0
' i 'd rather they just came and told me if they have a problem with the way things are run			0
' he said the situation was so bad he had to grow his top crops at a new secret location - and said another member of the allotment committee had his tomatoes wiped out when weedkiller was put in his water tank			1
another committee member had his water tank poisoned with weedkiller , which ruined a tomato crop			1
in @entity137 , @entity136 , gardening newcomer @entity135 , 28 , claimed he suffered from failing out with the allotment committee - and was told to vacate his plot simply because it was more vital than rivals '			0
the local council stepped in to say he could stay - but he said he could not face returning , the animosity was so great			0
mr @entity135 said : ' my pumpkins are the biggest on the allotment because my land , which was left untended for eight years , is so fertile			0
' i thought owning an allotment was going to be idyllic , harmonious , but it could n't be more different			0
when i joined , someone actually warned me , " it 's not like @entity151 here "			0
' in 2007 only 2.9 per cent of all food consumed in the home was self - produced - but by 2011 it was 5 per cent .			0
