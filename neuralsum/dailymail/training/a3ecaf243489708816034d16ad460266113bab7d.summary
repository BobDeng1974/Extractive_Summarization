retired radio presenter , @entity10 , was at the end of his tether because the ' agonising ' tinnitus was causing a constant a loud ' whooshing ' sound in his right ear			2
doctors in @entity17 diagnosed @entity10 's chronic condition - but said it was ' too dangerous ' to try and operate on it			1
retired radio presenter , @entity10 , was at the end of his tether because the ' agonising ' tinnitus was causing a constant loud ' whooshing ' sound in his right ear however , mr @entity10 refused to give up so tracked down an expert in @entity23 and emailed his brain scans to him			1
dr @entity25 , from @entity26 , @entity23 , sent the scans back with a series of arrows drawn on them			1
mr @entity10 took dr @entity25 's email to @entity33 in @entity34 and told doctors : ' this is how to cure me			1
' after four operations mr @entity10 has now made a full recovery			2
he said : ' in desperation , i researched the condition on the internet and emailed the scans to dr @entity25			1
' he emailed them back to me with lots of little arrows showing what was causing the whooshing problem			2
mr @entity10 refused to give up so tracked down an expert in @entity23 and emailed his brain scans to him dr @entity25 from @entity26 , @entity23 , sent the scans back with a series of arrows drawn on them ' it was n't as serious as the doctors here thought - and once they saw the arrows they knew how to fix it			1
' my life has been transformed and i want to cross the @entity59 to look dr @entity25 in the eye to thank him			1
' doctors in @entity17 diagnosed mr @entity10 with objective pulsatile tinnitus - caused by an obstruction in the passage between the heart and brain			1
tinnitus is the name given to the sensation of sound in the absence of an external source			0
@entity74 tinnitus is a rhythmical noise that usually has the same rate as the heart			0
it is caused by a change in blood flow in the vessels near the ear			0
@entity10 ( pictured right after an operation ) was cured thanks to help from dr @entity25 ( left ) mr @entity10 , of @entity84 , @entity85 , said he had been told his local hospital was unable to treat him , as it did not offer such care			1
but if did refer him to @entity88 's			0
he said : ' after the intervention and instructions from dr @entity25 everything was different			2
' i had four operations at @entity88 's - three of them in three days			0
' @entity88 's were wonderful			0
' mr @entity10 took dr @entity25 's email to @entity33 in @entity34 and told doctors : ' this is how to cure me ' after four operations mr @entity10 has now made a full recovery he said the noise in his ear was getting worse almost daily and unless it had been treated he would have attempted suicide			1
mr @entity10 is now working with @entity105 mp , @entity104 , to raise awareness of the problem			2
mr @entity104 said : ' i must compliment @entity10 's determination to send the scans to the @entity9 ' there has been recognition that the second opinion he had from @entity9 hit the nail on the head			1
' around one in seven @entity17 has suffered from tinnitus , the medical name for hearing ringing , buzzing or whistling noises inside the head which have no external source			2
the condition is thought to be triggered by over-active nerve cells within the hearing area of the brain			0
although there is no cure , therapies which use a generator to mask the ringing by creating a competing sound on a similar frequency – such as the sea – can relieve distress			0
cognitive behavioural therapy , in which patients are encouraged to discuss their problems , can also help patients to think differently about the condition and live with it long - term			0
however , there is little evidence about which treatment works best			0

@entity10 's tinnitus was so *unbearable* that he was contemplating suicide
doctors in the @entity17 diagnosed him but said it was ' too dangerous ' to operate
he emailed dr @entity25 in @entity23 with his brain scans
he sent the scans back with arrows which showed how to do the operation
doctors at @entity33 , @entity34 , were then able to cure him
