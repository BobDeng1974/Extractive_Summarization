by @entity0 in @entity1 in a glittering event that will @entity11 tonight officially launches its largest store in @entity13			1
despite the fact the brand has kept its celebrity guest list and details of the event a closely - guarded secret , the two arrived in @entity1 earlier this week and have been merrily instagramming photos of themselves around the city ever since			1
so naturally , we put two and two together ... and decided that they will of course be there ( more details to follow this evening when the event begins at around 8pm @entity1 time , 1pm gmt )			1
true to @entity11 ’s position as global leaders in social media and interactivity , they wo n’t just leave this one to be snapchatted by a few crowd members either			0
they have partnered up with @entity51 ’s largest and fastest - growing social media site , @entity50 , with 600m members and counting			0
big hitters on the site , like actors @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 have up to 80m followers each , dwarfing even @entity63 ’s loyal @entity62 headcount			0
the store itself , in the gleaming @entity67 mall in @entity1 's @entity69 district , pays tribute to the @entity73 @entity72 flagship that opened in september 2012			1
glittering event : the event , entitled @entity32 in @entity1 , will be held at a shipping yard in the sprawling metropolis , with @entity35 dressed in @entity11 's latest @entity77 collection party people : while it has n't been confirmed that the supermodels will be attending , @entity4 and @entity5 are the stars of the event 's teaser video so one can only presume ... it is smaller , but the design echoes that of its @entity32 counterpart , with a vast , open ‘ landing page ’ area ( like the @entity32 store , the intention is that you feel almost as though you have walked into the @entity93 website , with the digital experience brought to life in a physical space ) that plays host to a free - standing screen beaming out catwalk footage and a sweeping @entity101 stone staircase leading up to two more floors			1
it is not only the largest @entity11 store in @entity13 to date , but it also carries the largest beauty room , watch room and @entity108 collection			0
flagship : the store itself , in the gleaming @entity67 mall in @entity1 's @entity69 district , pays tribute to the @entity73 @entity72 flagship that opened in 2012 high - tech : the store has a ' landing page ' area ( like the @entity32 store , the intention is that you feel almost as though you have walked into the @entity93 website anything else ? oh yes - interactive mirrors that respond when you approach with a garment to feed you related content - a catwalk show , perhaps , or information about the fabric			1
the only thing they do n’t do is tell you how awesome you look ( @entity11 - could you look into that for us please ? ! )			0
the icing on the cake though is an intelligent glass facade that reacts to the weather and can change accordingly			0
by night it is lit up with the heritage @entity11 check across the building ; by day it responds to natural light or rain to present itself in different guises - something that 121 @entity72 , with its beautiful old stone exterior , can not match			2
furniture and fittings are all @entity73 - designed , and the window display is given over to the @entity149 collection - a celebration of the trench distilled down to its very essence , with three classic takes on the trench for women - the @entity156 , the @entity157 and the @entity158 ( men have four ) - each tweaked just slightly to offer a slimmer cut or tapered waist , for example			2
interactive : there will be interactive mirrors that respond when you approach with a garment to feed you related content swanky : furniture and fittings are all @entity73 - designed , and the window display is given over to the @entity149 collection it is eminently shoppable , and something to satisfy those of us who lust after the python or buttersoft leather trenches that run into the thousands but ca n’t quite justify buying them			2
of course , there are those who will just buy both			0
for your own virtual front row seat at the @entity11 event tonight , follow @entity11 on @entity50 , @entity186 , @entity62 and @entity187			1
check back at @entity188 later for details from inside the party .			0
