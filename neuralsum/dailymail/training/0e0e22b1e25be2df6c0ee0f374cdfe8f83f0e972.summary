' it would take a court order for us to get involved , ' @entity45 said to the @entity53 , ' and i ’m not anticipating a court order			0
' doctors at @entity57 believe @entity12 's leukemia is treatable , but say she will die without chemotherapy			1

absconded : the parents of @entity43 - the @entity3 girl who has treatable cancer have reportedly fled the @entity19 to avoid her being forced into treatment an appeals court ruling in october gave attorney @entity71 , who 's also a registered nurse limited guardianship over @entity12 and the power to make medical decisions for her			1
the court said the beliefs and convictions of her parents ca n't outweigh the rights of the state to protect the child			0
hoping to help : the hospital 's attorney @entity71 , who is also a registered nurse , would be granted the right to make @entity43 's medical decisions if the appeal is granted the family has appealed the decision to both the appeals court and the @entity93			1
they also plan to file a motion to terminate the guardianship			0

@entity11 , the girl 's father , said this past summer that the family agreed to begin two years of treatments for @entity12 last spring but stopped a second round of chemotherapy in june because it was making her extremely sick			1
traditions : @entity43 ( who is not pictured ) and her family are @entity3 , and their beliefs force them to shun technology and in turn , some forms of modern medicine @entity12 begged her parents to stop the chemo and they agreed after a great deal of prayer , @entity11 said			1
the family , members of an insular @entity3 community , shuns many facets of modern life and is deeply religious			2

hospital officials have said they are morally and legally obligated to make sure the girl receives proper care			0

' every day that goes by without treatment , @entity12 ’s chance of surviving her cancer is diminished			1
