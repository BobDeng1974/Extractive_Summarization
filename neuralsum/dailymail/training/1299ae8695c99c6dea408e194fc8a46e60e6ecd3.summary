by @entity0 , business correspondent published : 19:39 est , 2 october 2012 updated : 19:59 est , 2 october 2012 a nationwide collapse in house prices has led to the widest ‘ @entity6 ’ divide since records began , research revealed yesterday			1
prices have fallen in every region since the peak in 2007 , with property values in @entity11 crashing by 53 per cent			1
but falls in the @entity13 have been far greater than in the @entity14			1
house prices have plunged by up to 53 per cent since the peak in 2007 , with the @entity13 , @entity16 and @entity11 dominating the worst hit areas to live in the @entity14 , you have to pay a premium of nearly £ 100,000 on the price you would pay in the @entity13 , according to the @entity21			1
at present , a home in the @entity14 costs an average of £ 231,245 , compared to £ 135,340 in the @entity13			1
the news comes a day after the @entity25 revealed that a lavish property with 25 acres of park land , a clock tower , stables and servants ’ quarters in the @entity33 village of @entity34 has sold for just £ 241,000			2
in contrast , the average home in the @entity37 borough of @entity38 and @entity39 costs more than £ 1million			1
growing divide : prices have fallen nationwide ( left ) but the north has suffered more than the south			2
average house prices in the north of @entity47 have slipped from 70 per cent to 59 per cent of average southern @entity47 prices since 2005 ( right ) @entity21 said house prices have fallen in every single region of @entity50 since the peak , but some regions have been far worse affected than others			1
overall , the @entity21 's figures show house prices have more than halved since 2007 in @entity11 , but typically dropped by between 10 to 15 per cent in other regions			1
prices are down only 1.9 per cent in @entity37 , but 9.7 per cent in the @entity57 , 11.1 per cent in @entity58 , 14 per cent in @entity59 and the @entity60 and 16.1 per cent in the @entity61			1
@entity62 , chief economist at the @entity21 , said the jobs market was crucial to the future of house prices			2
if unemployment rose sharply , they were likely to fall further			0
' labour market developments will remain of paramount importance in deciding the trajectory of house prices , ' he said			2
‘ there are grounds for caution on this front as the unusual combination of rising employment and declining economic activity that was evident in the first half of 2012 is unlikely to be sustained			0
’ the figures highlight the nightmare facing homeowners who bought their property five years ago , and have seen its value collapse			0
many are trapped in negative equity , which means the size of their mortgage is larger than the current value of their property			0
overall , national house prices peaked in october 2007 at £ 186,044			1
today the average price is £ 163,964 , down 11.9 per cent			2
@entity93 , chief property economist at the @entity94 , said : ‘ it certainly seems as though the housing market is one area where there is precious little evidence of ‘ green shoots ’			0
‘ given the fragile nature of the economy , the huge squeeze on real incomes and offsetting impact of ultra-low interest rates , this gradual downward drift in house prices makes sense			2
’ @entity110 , chief executive of the mortgage broker @entity111 , said it is vital the @entity114 ’s new £ 80billion funding for lending scheme to help homeowners works			0
he said : ‘ there is already much debate as to whether it will help those borrowers who really need assistance			0
we need cheaper mortgages for people with smaller deposits			0
’ for example , the @entity126 yesterday launched a two - year fixed rate mortgage with a rate of just 2.44 per cent , but you need a 40 per cent deposit			0
the fee is £ 1,995			0
but , if you have a deposit of only five per cent , the rate will typically jump over six per cent for a two - year fixed rate deal , or over four per cent with a 10 per cent deposit .			0

house prices have fallen across the country but the @entity13 has been far worse affected than the @entity14
the gap between property prices in the @entity13 is now at its widest since records began in 1974
