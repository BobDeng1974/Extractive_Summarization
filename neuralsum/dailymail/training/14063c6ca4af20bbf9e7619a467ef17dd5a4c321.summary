she thinks gunman @entity163 's mother , who owned the weapons the 20 - year - old used to kill 20 six and seven - year - olds and six staff members in the december 14 assault , was negligent			1
' i think he had a mother who at best was blind ; at worst aided and abetted him , ' she said			0
' maybe she wanted to compensate for his feelings of inadequacy by letting him handle weapons of mass carnage and taking him to shooting ranges			0
