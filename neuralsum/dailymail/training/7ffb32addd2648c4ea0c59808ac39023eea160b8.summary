wombats are being buried to death during logging and it needs to stop now , the director of @entity1 said			2
@entity6 and her husband @entity7 have been patrolling the @entity8 of south coast @entity9 but they are still discovering blocked burrows from excessive soil , logs , rocks or debris during logging			1
the @entity18 couple , who run a wildlife sanctuary near their property , have marked over 150 wombat burrows with a gps , reporting on damages and negotiating with the loggers so they could avoid bulldozing over burrows			1
the wildlife sanctuary owner @entity28 saving a wombat from another collapsed burrow after the logging the @entity32 confirmed the state government - owned @entity33 of @entity9 had agreed to ensure entrances to the burrows were not obstructed by logging debris as it felled the southern forest , according to @entity39			1
but ms @entity6 told @entity40 that even restricting truck movements with planned out maps and markings had not been taken into consideration and were completely ignored by contractors			1
' it 's just heartbreaking when my husband and i find burrows that are compacted by machinery and logs			0
we can no longer reopen them because they 're too deep , ' she said			0
' wombats have not been able to dig themselves out and end up suffocating to death			0
' ' we ca n't interfere when they 're logging but all we can do is go in after it 's done and try to reopen the burrows again - that 's all we can do for now			0
' they are one of the most intelligent animals in the world and they are more clever than dogs			0
' we really need to continue and push for legislation to give these wombats a second chance at life			1
' the burrow backfilled three times and was sitting underneath an enormous pile of logs mr @entity28 unblocking the wombat burrow the @entity75 members met with @entity77 officers from @entity78 on saturday to assure the loggers were following the agreement , as well as investigating the deaths of the wombats			0
but ms @entity6 said the loggers had ' deliberately ' removed the gps markings and filled burrows in again once the @entity77 officers had left			1
a @entity33 spokesman said ' wombats use multiple burrows ' and ' larger burrows generally have several entrances and wombats are able to re-excavate or remove obstacles at burrow entrances			2
' with 25 years of observing bare - nosed wombats , ms @entity6 said these claims were untrue			1
' some people believe that wombats can dig themselves out but they do n't have the strength to do so			0
when their burrows collapse or blocked from logging , they 're trapped deep down , causing significant harm or drawn out deaths , ' ms @entity6 said			1
@entity6 and her husband @entity7 had taken their time out to mark over 150 wombat burrows with a gps for the contractors to follow during the logging the wombat 's head and face was injured , bleeding from nose and was disoriented after the logging she told @entity39 that thorough searching had not uncovered a single burrow with more than one entrance and such burrows were rare for this variety of wombat			1
the @entity124 @entity123 regional co-ordinator @entity122 said @entity33 's comments were ' ridiculous			0
' ' the bare - nosed wombats just have one entrance in and out , so if it is ploughed over , that ’s it			0
you are looking at a slow death with lack of food and water , ' said ms @entity122			0
@entity134 ’s environment spokesman @entity133 told @entity39 that @entity33 should honour its agreement with the wildlife groups , which had been ' an opportunity for a positive community partnership to ameliorate the impacts of logging			2
' ' wildlife carers spent many hours painstakingly marking and recording wombat burrows only to return and find callous disregard had been given to these harmless and vulnerable animals , ' he said .			2
