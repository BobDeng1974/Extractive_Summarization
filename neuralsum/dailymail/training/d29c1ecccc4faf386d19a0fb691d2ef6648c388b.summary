just weeks after victory at @entity2 , @entity0 is spying major glory again			2

@entity0 , who became the first @entity10 golfer to win three of the four majors since the @entity12 was founded in 1934 , is seeking his second straight major after claiming the @entity14 at @entity15 last month			0
' i said at the start of the year that golf was looking for someone to put their hand up and become one of the dominant players in the game			0
' i felt like i had the ability to do that and it 's just nice to be able to win a few tournaments and get back to where i feel like i should be , which is near the top of the world rankings and competing in majors and winning golf tournaments			0
all eyes on me : @entity0 signs autographs ahead of the final major of the season on top of the world : @entity0 can continue a stellar season with another fine performance in @entity50 video the @entity52 highlights ' i 'm not necessarily sure you can call that an era or the start of an era , but i 'm just really happy with where my golf game is at the minute and i just want to try and continue that for as long as possible			1
and the newly - crowned world no 1 is the man on a golden run and has been installed as the bookies ' favourite after winning the @entity65 last week .			1
