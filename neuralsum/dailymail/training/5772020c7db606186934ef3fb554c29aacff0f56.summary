prince @entity0 returned to @entity1 today on behalf of the @entity2 as he led emotional tributes to his friends who died in the name of war			1
it was a highly meaningful return for the prince , who was posted to the country on a tour of duty in 2007 - 08 and again in 2012 - 13			1
the 30 - year - old left a personal wreath at @entity13 which read : ' there is no greater love than to lay down one 's life for one 's friends			1
they will never be forgotten			0
he served alongside other soldiers during his secret first deployment to @entity1 in 2007 - 08 , then again when he returned to the country in 2012 - 13 tribute : the 30 - year - old also read from @entity35 in the @entity36 , the passage from which he took the quote on his poppy wreath salute : today 's visit came just weeks after it was revealed @entity43 combat operations had come to an end after 13 years of conflict the quote came from @entity47 15:13 , a @entity36 passage which @entity0 read as part of a remembrance sunday service at the dwindling base where he also met colleagues from his former unit			1
the full quote comes as @entity55 addresses his disciples , and reads : ' my command is this : love each other as i have loved you			0
greater love has no one than this : to lay down one ’s life for one ’s friends			0
' you are my friends if you do what i command			0
i no longer call you servants , because a servant does not know his master ’s business			0
instead , i have called you friends , for everything that i learned from my father i have made known to you			0
' it was believed to be the @entity0 's first return to @entity1 since his operational role came to an end in january 2013			1
the @entity81 confirmed @entity0 's role this afternoon - only after he had safely left @entity13 - after he was notably absent from the @entity84 commemorations in @entity85 which included his brother			1
there are just a few hundred remaining troops in @entity1 , where their combat role officially came to an end on october 26			2
@entity0 served in @entity1 twice , but his maiden deployment had to be cut short after a foreign publication broke a strict media blackout on details of his whereabouts			1
the @entity0 lined up with fellow servicemen to hear @entity97 and @entity98 played by musicians from the @entity100			2
sparse : there are just a few hundred remaining troops in @entity1 , where their combat role officially came to an end on october 26 combat : the first return since january 2013 was an opportunity for the prince to be reunited with some of his old colleagues flying visit : pilots showed the prince inside the cockpit of an @entity114 on his brief trip to @entity13 this morning for security reasons the visit remained under a media blackout until the @entity0 left , much like his first deployment in 2007 - 08 after the service he met personnel from @entity122 ( @entity1 ) and 904 @entity123 , including members of 31 squadron @entity114 serving their final tour of @entity1			1
he climbed into the cockpit of a @entity128 and learned how the jet has served in recent operations , a @entity81 spokesman said			0
the prince , whose second deployment was as an @entity134 co-pilot and gunner , was the first royal to see active combat since his uncle the @entity138 fought in the @entity139			0

a royal spokesman said : ' prince @entity0 was honoured to be able to attend the last remembrance service in southern @entity1 , especially given his personal experience of operational service			1
' he felt it important to mark this significant milestone , remembering all those who have lost their lives during the campaign			0
' there was a sombre atmosphere today as the remaining troops in @entity1 remembered the 13 - year fight which has claimed more than 450 @entity43 lives			1
@entity164 ( @entity164 ) personnel and civilians gathered for remembrance services in @entity167 and @entity13 - likely to be the last involving @entity43 military based in @entity1			1
the ceremony in @entity167 today was led by the @entity171 dr @entity170 and attended by personnel from all three services , along with senior representatives from the international coalition			0
@entity176 in @entity177 is due to close in a few weeks and the final @entity43 troops are due to be pulled out of @entity1 by the end of the year			1
top gun : the prince , a captain with the @entity140 and @entity141 since 2011 , quit the @entity144 in january for a desk job organising events warm welcome : the prince arrived basked in golden morning sunshine as he arrived in secret in the mountainous terrain of @entity13 the @entity0 arrived on an @entity114 c - 17 transporter plane as part of the commemorations in @entity1 , where 453 @entity192 have died one among many : @entity0 joined other soldiers in falling silent today to pay tribute to all those who have died in armed conflict light relief : despite the briefness of the visit there was still time to share a joke with other soldiers at the base in southern @entity1 laughs : the @entity0 met soldiers before being flown back out of the base in secret			1

we will never forget their extraordinary courage and dedication , and our thoughts will always remain with the families and friends of those we have lost			0
' the final @entity84 ceremony in southern @entity1 has significant poignancy as we pay tribute to the 453 men and women who have given their lives since 2001 , along with the many hundreds who have suffered life changing injuries			2
' we are incredibly proud of what they have achieved			0
thanks to their sacrifice , @entity1 is a better country and we walk in safer streets at home in the @entity43			1
