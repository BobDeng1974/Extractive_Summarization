by @entity1 reporter published : 13:14 est , 5 may 2012 updated : 09:30 est , 6 may 2012 it was an embarrassing start for president @entity5 's re-election campaign yesterday as he held his first political rally of the 2012 race in a half - empty arena			1
with wife @entity9 dressed head to toe in campaign colors at his side , @entity5 targeted swing states @entity15 and @entity16 that are critical for his bid to remain in the @entity18			1
the president formally launched his @entity20 - based re-election effort last year but his official political events have been confined to fundraisers since then			0
scant support : @entity5 's rally for the 2012 presidential race at @entity26 appeared to have a poor turnout rousing : president @entity5 addressed his first official campaign rally in @entity15 saturday after releasing an email to encourage supporters to watch the rally and donate money that changed this weekend , however , with results which may have surprised @entity5			1
the president , who was propelled to power in the 2008 election thanks in part to huge rallies across the nation , hoped to regain that momentum with events in large arenas in @entity43 , @entity15 and @entity44 , @entity16			0
come game time , however , with his first event - which was free and open to the public - held at @entity26 , his numbers appeared to fall flat , according to several reports			1
one photo taken and posted to @entity50 by @entity53 rival @entity52 's campaign spokesman @entity51 showed the floor and seats with more space than people			1
the venue holds 20,000 and according to figures from @entity5 's campaign , 14,000 attended the event - 70 per cent of the stadium 's seating capacity			1
according to the paper , event organisers busied themselves moving people from the stage 's surrounding seats to the arena 's floor to depict a better crowd to television cameras			1
@entity53 forecast : the @entity73 earlier released their own prepared remarks for the president which forecast a tepid audience aiming to encourage his supporters , @entity5 released an email prior to his rally reminding them to watch his first rally and donate money			2
' the crowd 's starting to form in @entity43 , and they 're ready to go , ' he said in the email			2
' in a little while , i 'll go on stage for the first rally of 2012			2
' @entity5 's campaign is eager to get the president on the road and at the center of the political battle			1
' we 're ready to go , ' campaign manager @entity94 told reporters in a recent conference call			2
' while @entity52 has been busy endearing himself to the @entity98 and making promises he ca n't keep , we 've been busy building the largest grassroots campaign in modern @entity102 history			1
' the @entity73 released their own email earlier saturday morning , however , in the mocking form of fake prepared remarks for the president 's rally in @entity43			1
' @entity15 , thanks for the tepid welcome			0
i know i 'm not as popular here as i once was , so i 'll take what i can get , ' the @entity73 said in the imagined speech it dubbed ' as prepared for reality			0
' true blue : the @entity120 , wearing campaign colours from head to foot , also addressed the @entity15 crowd support : @entity5 is traveling to @entity15 and @entity16 where he will hold rallies and officially begin his re-election bid for the 2012 us presidential election ' it turns out the hope and change i promised did n't work out			2
so , we 've launched a new strategy : hype and blame , ' the @entity73 's email said			2
since mr @entity52 became his party 's presumptive nominee , mr @entity5 has criticised his opponent in formal and informal situations - a sign that he is more than ready to launch the attacks that are expected to characterise a potentially ugly and negative campaign			1
@entity53 accuse mr @entity5 of infusing politics into his official @entity18 events and scoff at the notion that his campaigning is just starting			0
the president has done official trips in recent months to highlight his energy record and to tout proposals to reduce costs for students			0
young people are an important constituency for his campaign			2
the @entity5 campaign has mapped out several scenarios to win the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the presidency , and the choice of states for his inaugural rallies was not coincidental			0
@entity15 , with its large cache of 18 electoral votes , is a particularly coveted prize			0
capacity : according to reports , the event filled just 14,000 of its 20,000 capacity which was free and open to the public no @entity53 has made it to the @entity18 in the last century without winning the state			0
@entity5 bested @entity53 rival @entity172 there in 2008			0
@entity15 has struggled with a loss of manufacturing jobs , but its unemployment rate , at 7.5 per cent in march , is below the national average , which was 8.2 per cent in march and dipped to 8.1 per cent in april			0
that could help blunt mr @entity52 's attacks on mr @entity5 's economic record			1
the president 's campaign also hopes to capitalize on union anger over an attempt by the state 's @entity53 governor , @entity185 , to limit collective bargaining rights for firefighters , police officers , and other state workers			1
the law was later repealed			0
polls show mr @entity5 is leading mr @entity52 in @entity15 and @entity16			1
an average of polls by @entity195 showed the president ahead in @entity15 by 4.2 percentage points and ahead in @entity16 by 3.2 percentage points			0
@entity16 had an even lower unemployment rate in march , coming in at 5.6 percent			0
the @entity5 campaign will also try to capitalize on an advantage with women voters in the state , where the governor - @entity53 @entity205 - promoted legislation that would have required women to undergo an invasive trans - vaginal sonogram before getting an abortion			0
mr @entity5 's wife , @entity9 , will also help attract the female vote			0
the popular first lady , who has done fundraisers across the country for her husband 's campaign , will be at his side for both rallies .			1
