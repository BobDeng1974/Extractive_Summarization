by @entity0 published : 15:53 est , 9 february 2013 updated : 17:10 est , 9 february 2013 more wind turbines are being built in @entity2 than ever before as the country becomes the third highest wind power generator in @entity5			1
more than 1,200 turbines are set to start generating power over the next 12 months in a trend thought to be motivated by a planned cut in subsidies , due to come into effect in april			1
new figures also showed that the @entity2 has overtaken @entity13 and @entity14 , generating 8.4 gigawatts of wind energy , according to the @entity16 ( @entity16 )			1
wind power : more wind turbines are being built in @entity2 than ever before in a trend thought to be motivated by a planned cut in subsidies , due to come into effect in april the building of onshore turbines is up 60 per cent since last year with 763 turbines due to be built , while another 7,843 have building approval but are yet to be constructed , according to @entity27			1
a @entity29 spokesperson said that 63 per cent of onshore wind planning applications were approved last year			2
the wind power generated by the 4,369 turbines already in operation in @entity2 is enough to power an equivalent of more than 4.6 million homes			1
@entity36 , deputy chief executive from @entity37 , which provides energy sector data said : ‘ the government is calling for the @entity2 to quadruple the amount of wind installed between now and 2020			2
‘ @entity42 as a crucial part of our energy mix and is becoming more important as extra onshore and offshore capacity is added to the system			0
‘ the industry can achieve 31 gigawatts onshore and offshore by the end of the decade , but only with clear cross-party political support			0
’ ' we can attract billions of pounds worth of investment to the @entity2 and create tens of thousands of jobs , but only if the signals from @entity56 are right			2
‘ the proof of this will be in the @entity59 , which is due to become law by the end of the year			0
so the decisions taken by @entity39 over next few months are absolutely crucial for the @entity2 ’s wind industry			2
' the @entity29 announced the 10 per cent subsidy cut to onshore wind turbines last year , in a move they say will encourage up to £ 25billion in new investment in generating energy			1
extreme weather : just last week a 115ft , £ 250,000 wind turbine in @entity73 , @entity70 was blown over by high winds , three years after it was built dr @entity75 , director of the @entity76 , was quoted in the @entity27 saying : ‘ the @entity2 's wind power deployment on and offshore is way ahead of the learning curve and needs to slow down to a rational pace to avoid insupportable burdens on the consumer and the risk of major malinvestment the unwinding of which will be painful and embarrassing			1
’ according to @entity37 , the numbers of small scale wind turbines and wind farms increased by 50 per cent last year , but projects have divided opinion with many communities fighting against the erection of turbines , considered to be a visual blight on the landscape			2
just last week a 115ft , £ 250,000 wind turbine in @entity73 , @entity70 was blown over by high winds			0
experts believe the winds were so strong the blades span out of control causing the massive structure to catch fire and collapse			0
it was supposed to have a life expectancy of 25 years – but has lasted just three			0
the government hopes that wind energy will play a vital part in @entity2 's 2020 target for energy from renewable sources , contributing up to 14 per cent of the total required energy which could power an equivalent of 7.7 million homes			1
a department spokesperson said : ' we expect to need up to @entity117 of onshore wind to help meet our 2020 renewables targets			0
we currently have @entity121 operational , @entity122 consented , and @entity123 in planning			0
' however , not everything in planning will be consented , and not everything consented will be built			0

over 1,200 wind turbines are to become operational over the next 12 months
the @entity2 has become the third highest wind power generator in @entity5
turbines already in use generate enough energy to power over 4.6m homes
