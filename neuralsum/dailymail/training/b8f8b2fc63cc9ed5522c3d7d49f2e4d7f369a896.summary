@entity0 is set to become the january transfer window ’s biggest domestic saga and possibly the biggest domestic deal			1
@entity4 are ready to consider selling prized asset @entity0 - perhaps for as much as £ 60million - to fund a spending spree in order to shore up their faltering squad and make sure the club does not tumble into the relegation battle			2
in that respect it is understood @entity4 will listen to offers is excess of £ 45m for @entity0			2
@entity0 ( left ) could be sold by @entity4 with @entity16 interested in signing the midfielder @entity0 has impressed since returning to the side after injury earlier in the season @entity16 are the club most likely to make a move to sign the 21 - year - old @entity22 international			1
last summer @entity4 gave the player a new deal worth £ 65,000 a week to fend off interest from @entity16			1
but as it stands @entity16 , who see fit - again @entity0 as a player who could take them the extra mile in the @entity33 title race , would offer to double the player ’s wages , then play hard ball with struggling @entity4 over a fee which last summer was reported to be £ 60m			1
if @entity0 is sold by @entity4 it could bring the situation of suddenly under pressure boss @entity41 to a head			1
@entity41 ( left ) is under pressure at @entity4 with @entity44 a rumoured possible replacement as revealed last week , @entity41 , seemingly fire proof at the start of the season , is now under pressure ahead of tuesday ’s @entity50 tie with @entity51			1
if @entity41 was to be ousted then @entity52 manager @entity44 - on @entity54 ’s shortlist - would be a contender for the @entity56 hot seat			1
as revealed on november 1 in this column , @entity57 would turn down a new reduced deal with @entity60 and seek new pastures in the @entity62			1
that has come to pass			0
three @entity65 clubs - @entity64 , @entity66 and @entity67 - will bid for @entity57			2
but given franchise parameters it is not yet clear who will be able to offer the former @entity22 player the £ 150,000 - plus - a - week deal he wants after he rejected a new contract worth half that at @entity60			1
@entity57 ( centre ) will leave @entity60 at the end of the season with the @entity65 his likely destination @entity79 side @entity78 are also still interested			1
there is also still interest in @entity57 in @entity82 - notably with @entity85 clubs @entity83 and @entity86 , as well as @entity88 ’s @entity87			2
also as revealed in this column two months ago , @entity89 and @entity60 are about to go head to head for @entity94 striker @entity93			1
ideally @entity94 want £ 25m for the @entity96 striker to fund a spending spree now to be masterminded by new boss @entity98			2
spurs value the player at £ 15m			2
@entity60 may go higher but have other targets , not least @entity102 ’s want away @entity103 and possibly @entity104 as a stop gap			1
@entity93 , who scored four goals in @entity94 's 7 - 0 win over @entity108 , is wanted by several clubs @entity104 has suddenly become the most wanted striker available to @entity33 clubs			1
@entity104 , on offer from @entity65 soccer side @entity67 , is being considered by @entity60 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			1
the best package will seal the deal - although a move to @entity115 and back to his @entity120 roots could appeal to @entity104 if the @entity115 stump up at least £ 70,000 a week			1
@entity115 also head the race to sign @entity124 striker @entity123 on loan for the rest of the season			0
@entity129 ’s @entity128 has expressed a preference to join @entity131 which in turn would then see @entity124 land @entity133 from @entity135			1
i am hearing : @entity137 is about to reject a new deal with @entity139			1
that could mean that in their final season at the @entity142 and with the ramp up to the @entity144 in mind , @entity51 could well push the boat out and sign fans hero @entity137 on a massive deal in the summer			1
@entity137 is rumoured to be considering rejecting a new contract from @entity151 club @entity139 @entity137 ( left ) became a cult hero during his one season at @entity51 i am also hearing : unlike predecessors @entity156 and @entity98 , new @entity115 boss @entity154 wont be wearing tracksuits on the touchline			1
@entity154 prefers a more sophisticated , tailored ' @entity85 ' manager look - and indeed employs the services of a personal tailor , @entity162 of @entity163 , who makes suits for top stars ranging from @entity167 to sir @entity168			0
btw : @entity57 deserves all the plaudits he has received			0
he has had a great career with @entity60 and @entity22			2
it should be remembered though , amid all the sentimentality , that one of @entity57 ’s motivations to leave @entity60 after all these years is because the two - year contract the club put on the table was , understandably , not as big as the one which will expire in the summer			1
about half in fact , a drop from around £ 140,000 a week to £ 70k			2
@entity191 * @entity193 players only 1			0
@entity57 * @entity193 players only @entity57 could have stayed for two more seasons but after so many years of loyalty decided to take the offer of bigger money in the @entity62			0
there is no doubt though , he has been one of the game ’s all - time greats			0
it was interesting to see @entity209 's @entity208 put @entity57 tenth in his top ten all time list of @entity22 midfielders			0
of the midfielders i have seen - so i ca n’t include legends like @entity196 or @entity194 - here is my top 10			0
sir @entity183 , 2 @entity184 , 3 @entity185 , 4 @entity186 , 5 @entity187 , 6 @entity188 , 7 @entity57 , 8 @entity189 , 9 @entity190 , 10 @entity191			0
@entity217 : the farce surrounding the @entity188 situation highlights how flawed the loan system has become			0
it is now being suggested that beyond remaining ' on loan ' at @entity16 from @entity65 team @entity223 until the end of the season ( as opposed to joining up with them next month ) @entity188 may , in fact , be signed on a full - time basis by @entity16 from , er , @entity16			2
@entity188 ( centre ) celebrates scoring @entity16 's third goal in their 3 - 2 win over @entity233 despite the ire of @entity66 fans about the situation that would of course be a formality given both clubs have the same @entity239 based owners			1
that in itself illustrates a potential long term danger of conflict of interest in the case of multiple ownership of clubs around the globe			0
such scenarios will i suspect become more common			0
and of course the situation begs the question was there ever the intention for @entity188 to play in @entity223 in the first place ? was his move from @entity258 to the @entity259 then back to the @entity33 with a rival club a way of making a smooth departure from @entity263 to the @entity264 ? also was it a way of @entity16 of getting around @entity267 rules ? most pressingly , how it is a club like @entity16 , who have such a big squad they have often had 20 players out on loan at one time , able to take a player on loan themselves ? @entity188 takes part in a football clinic in @entity223 in july after signing for @entity223 fc @entity188 , pictured during his unveiling at @entity279 , is yet to play a minute in the @entity65 surely the @entity33 should step in and stipulate that a club who has more than say two players out on loan ca n’t take a player on loan			2
moreover , there should be no loans between @entity33 clubs unless the player is under 21 or over 30			0
the @entity33 and @entity291 decree third party ownership of players is against the spirit of the game			0
but i say the two scenarios above amount to the same			0
@entity300 : in recent seasons the @entity50 has recovered some of it ’s magic			0
@entity304 beating @entity16 in the final two seasons ago and @entity114 running @entity124 close last year have revived the notion that ' smaller ' clubs can win silverware			1
or at least get close			0
on that basis @entity310 surely have a chance to go all the way this season			0
they are 20 - 1			0
@entity51 who have an awkward trip to @entity4 on tuesday are currently 40 - 1			2
@entity318 has vowed to go all out in the @entity50 this season now the team are essentially safe			0
so it is worth a punt on the @entity51 , who reached the final in 2006 , at that price			2
a revived @entity89 are 14 - 1			0
@entity258 are favourites at 5 - 1 with the usual suspects tucked in behind .			0

@entity16 interested in midfielder and will offer him £ *130,000* a week
@entity41 under pressure with @entity44 a possible replacement
@entity60 one of a number of clubs looking at striker @entity104
@entity129 ’s @entity128 keen to join @entity131
@entity137 to reject @entity139 deal and is a target for @entity51
