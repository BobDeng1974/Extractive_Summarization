by @entity0 president @entity1 has revealed that has has n't ruled out abandoning an attack on @entity4 , and that he has been secretly discussing a non-military resolution to the @entity4 crisis with @entity8 president @entity7 ' for quite some time			1
' ' we will pursue this diplomatic track , ' @entity1 told @entity12 anchor @entity11			1
' i fervently hope that this can be resolved in a non-military way			0
' but ' it 's fair to say that i have n't decided ' what to do if @entity19 fails to authorize a military strike against the @entity22 regime in @entity4 , he conceded to @entity24 ' @entity23			1
while he said he was ' heartbroken ' seeing videos of a suspected sarin gas attack 's aftermath in @entity4 , the president admitted that ' i would n't say i 'm confident ' about the outcome on @entity30			2
but if @entity22 were to voluntarily give up his chemical weapons , would @entity1 call off the @entity32 ? ' absolutely , ' he told @entity34 anchor @entity33 , ' if in fact that happens			1
' the comments came as part of an unprecedented series of sit - down television interviews monday , in which @entity1 was expected to make the the case for military intervention in @entity4 but instead seemed to cleave to a softer approach			1
secretary of state @entity66 provided the president with an unlikely opening earlier on monday in @entity69 , offering an off - hand answer to a reporter 's question about what @entity22 might do to avert a @entity75 military attack			1
the @entity1 administration would not launch a military strike against @entity4 , @entity66 said , if the dictator were to ' turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week			1
' a @entity52 official had told @entity46 that the episode was the result of a ' major goof ' by @entity66 , who had ' clearly gone off script			2
' still , @entity87 and @entity4 foreign minister @entity88 leaped at the concept and quickly announced that they would be in favor of it			2
@entity52 press secretary @entity93 cautioned , however , that it might be a ' stalling tactic			0
' secretary of state @entity66 started the day 's confusing series of events by suggesting that the @entity75 would forgo an attack if @entity22 turned over his chemical weapons within a week @entity8 foreign minister @entity87 ( @entity100 ) and his @entity4 counterpart @entity101 ( r ) both said they would push for a proposal that would turn @entity4 's chemical weapons over to international forces that would destroy them , but @entity66 later said the idea he floated was n't a serious one despite @entity66 's backpedal , @entity1 told @entity12 that he would ' welcome the possibility of the development			1
we should explore and exhaust all avenues of diplomatic resolution to this			0
' @entity115 of the @entity116 and @entity23 of the @entity117 both asked presdient @entity1 what his wife thinks about attacking @entity4			0
he replied that the first lady opposes the idea			0
' my own family members ... they 're very wary and suspicious , ' the president said during his @entity47 interview			0
' if you ask @entity130 , " do we â€“ do we want to be involved in another war ? " the answer is no , ' he added on @entity24			0
most @entity75 share @entity133 's view , despite the @entity52 's recent saber - rattling and the president 's pursuit of congressional approval to attack @entity4			1
the @entity138 reported monday that 63 per cent of @entity75 adults think the @entity75 should not strike the @entity22 regime			0
' we are going to be immediately talking to the @entity8 and looking for some actual language they might be proposing , ' @entity1 added			0
none of the three news anchors whose interviews aired first on monday challenged the president with the fact that @entity66 had later said that he was n't presenting a serious proposal			2
@entity1 explained during his @entity24 interview that @entity8 's willingness to help its ally @entity4 negotiate a handover of its chemical weapons was ' a potentially positive development , ' but also said the @entity157 - era maxim ' trust but verify ' would apply			1
' we do n't want just a stalling or delaying tactic to put off the pressure that we have on there right now , ' he cautioned			0
and when @entity116 host @entity115 asked the president if he had broached the subject of a @entity8 - brokered deal with @entity4 , he said , ' i did have those conversations			1
and this is the continuation of conversations i 've had with president @entity7 for quite some time			1
' while maintaining that @entity4 violated international norms and expressed a desire to see that ' the blatant use of chemical weapons that we saw ' on august 21 in a @entity177 suburb ' does n't happen again			1
' ' if , in fact , there is a way to accomplish that diplomatically , that is overwhelmingly my preference , ' he said firmly			0
by @entity186 's count , @entity12 's @entity11 was the first anchor to air an interview , beating the field by mere seconds in what turned out to be a race to see which program could capture its audience with the quickest @entity1 quote on monday night deputy national security advisor @entity195 ( @entity100 ) told reporters that his department was n't aware of any proposal for @entity4 to give up its chemical weapons until secretary of state @entity66 suggested it monday , off - the - cuff , in @entity69 ' and i have instructed @entity66 to talk directly to the @entity8 and run this to ground			1
and if we can exhaust these diplomatic efforts and come up with a formula that gives the international community a verifiable , enforceable mechanism to deal with these weapons on @entity4 , then i 'm all for it			2
' ' but we 're going to have to see specifics , ' the president cautioned			0
' and i think it is reasonable to assume that we would not be at this point if there were not a credible military threat standing behind the norm against the use of chemical weapons			2
' the president faces a steep uphill climb in @entity19 , with the @entity222 facing a filibuster possibility from the @entity225 's right wing and a rising tide of opposition in the @entity225 - controlled @entity228			2
no fewer than 70 federal lawmakers made treks to the @entity52 on monday to hear the president 's argument for why they should vote in favor of authorizing a military strike , if he should deem it necessary			1
but while @entity1 has asked both houses to endorse the proposal , he insisted on @entity12 that ' the @entity75 people are right not to want to have us entangled in a sectarian civil war inside of @entity4			1
' continuing to pursue the congressional war - powers resolution , @entity1 said , was primarily a tactical move at this point			2
' i think it is important for us not to let the pedal off the metal when it comes to making sure they understand we mean what we say , ' he said			0
of all the major news networks			0
@entity45 was the only one that did not broadcast an interview during the dinner hour			0
its coverage was pre-empted by the @entity258 tennis men 's final match .			0

' we will pursue this diplomatic track , ' @entity1 told @entity12
' i have n't decided ' what to do if @entity19 *refuses* to endorse military action , he told @entity24
he would ' absolutely ' call off a military strike , @entity1 said on @entity34 , if @entity22 were to credibly give up his chemical weapons
talk of a @entity8 - brokered deal is ' the continuation of conversations i 've had with president @entity7 for quite some time , ' @entity1 told @entity47
secretary of state @entity66 *accidentally* floated the idea of an *agreement* in @entity69 , later saying he was n't serious
@entity8 's and @entity4 's foreign ministers both leaped into the opening , saying they would support such an *arrangement* if it would *prevent* war
the @entity52 hosted at lest 70 members of @entity19 on monday , arguing that the threat of military force will keep @entity22 in *negotiations*
