recently the @entity0 returned to work for the first time since succumbing to severe morning sickness – and in true royal style hit the ground running with a succession of appearances			1
but while she looked every inch the glamorous princess on the tuesday at an awards ceremony at the @entity11 , on wednesday during an @entity12 dinner fashion watchers described her as looked rather more washed out			0
why ? is it because she was attending her third event in two days			0
because she is the mother of a 15 - month - old toddler ? or because she is 13 weeks pregnant with her second child ? @entity18 according to certain style experts , who say it is because she does n't always choose colours that suit her complexion			2
‘ it is quite obvious that @entity42 is a summer , ’ she said			0
‘ i would say her best shades are @entity51 navy , airforce blue , aubergine , plum , burgundy , soft berry and grey ( anything from silver to slate )			1
' @entity62 colours are too bright and playful for @entity42 , winter colours too overpowering and autumn colours are too heavy and boring			1
the summer colours accentuate her natural beauty – she looks sophisticated and elegant in cool soft tones			1
’ according to @entity38 , people who want to look their best – like @entity42 – should visit a professionally - trained colour analyst , who will put swatches of fabric against your skin to find out which season you are			1
certainly ' having your colours done ' is the latest craze on @entity76			0
' if you have blue tones in your skin , you are either summer or winter , ’ she explains			1
‘ both tend to suit the cooler , silver jewellery and colours that have a blue tint rather than a yellow tint			2
' winter can wear more intense bold colours in high contrast – black and white , dark navy , fuchsia , scarlet - while summer look better in a softer blend of colours – grey , plum , powder pink , @entity51 navy , berry tones dusted with icing sugar			1
' if you have warmer , yellow tones in your skin , you are likely to be either spring or autumn			1
they tend to look better in gold jewellery and colours that have a yellow tint rather than a blue one			2
' @entity104 colours are earthier shades with a hint of black in them – browns , russets , olive greens			1
@entity62 colours , on the other hand , are brighter , fresher and more playful – yellows , corals and turquoise blues			0
’ from the glamorous burgundy coat chosen for her first @entity119 at @entity121 to the yellow @entity123 coat worn to a @entity125 garden party last summer , @entity117 reveals the @entity0 's best style hits ( and a few misses ) with colour analyst ratings ... 10/10 looking good in blue : @entity42 chose @entity130 both during her 2011 visit to @entity132 ( left ) and her engagement photocall in novemeber 2010 ( right )			1
expert @entity38 says : ' @entity51 navy is a cool mid-tone blue but with just the right amount of depth to give @entity42 a glow			1
’ 10/10 beautiful in @entity140 : @entity42 looks much better in this wine colour for her first @entity119 at @entity121 in 2011 ( left ) rather than the brown coat she wore in @entity143 in 2013 ( right )			0
the expert 's verdict : ' dark pink berry tones compliment her natural colouring and are sensational for @entity42			2
the cool tones of the plum coat compliment @entity42 much better than the warm mahogany colour			1
' 9/10 glamorous in tweed : @entity42 wore this @entity154 dress and @entity156 hat when she joined the @entity157 and prince @entity158 during the @entity160 tour			0
the verdict ? ‘ the tone - tone effect of the tweed creates a softer look and compliments @entity42 beautifully			0
’ elegant in silver : @entity166 wore this subtle shade for the @entity169 's @entity168 at the @entity170 in 2012 which @entity38 describes as a ' winning colour on @entity42 ' 9/10 looking stunning in @entity174 : @entity42 chose this cool tone for both an @entity177 service at @entity178 in @entity179 2014 ( left ) and emerging from the plane at @entity181 on her first overseas tour in july 2011 ( right )			1
the expert says : ‘ soft grey looks sophisticated on @entity42 and evens out her skin tone			1
’ 8/10 : @entity186 evening wear : @entity42 wore a stunning dusky pink gown to a gala dinner in @entity189 in june 2011 ( left ) and a soft lilac to a 2011 gala in @entity192			2
@entity38 says : ' soft , delicate and sheer also works well for @entity42 , while soft lilac is a sophisticated alternative to white			2
’ 7/10 beautiful in @entity197 : @entity42 chose a brighter shade when she visited her new portrait , hung at the @entity200 by artist @entity201 in 2013 and the expert says ' soft berry reds are better than vibrant orange reds ' 6/10 : @entity206 shades : for both the @entity207 ( left ) and a dinner at @entity209 at @entity210 in may 2012 ( right ) @entity42 wore off - white			1
however the expert says : ' soft white is preferable to optic white although we feel @entity42 needs a little more colour to look her best			2
’ @entity42 wore this @entity217 white broderie anglaise suit when visiting the @entity219 jet engine factory in @entity220 in september 2012			0
what the experts say : ‘ swap optic white for a soft white or soft grey and this outfit would be a winner			0
’ 4/10 candy cane colours : this @entity230 £ 159 white @entity229 engagement dress and @entity231 at @entity232 red hat with maple leaf which @entity42 wore for @entity236 celebrations july 2011			0
but @entity38 says : ‘ you see the hat first ! @entity239 and white is too contrasting for @entity42			0
’ 3/10 : @entity38 thinks this @entity241 £ 350 olive green turtle - neck dress ( left ) ' looks heavy on @entity42 '			1
while the mint green @entity245 coat ( right ) is ‘ an uncomfortable combination of both colour and style			0
a grey taupe hat with an airforce blue jacket would be a better combination			0
’ 2/10 an earthy disappointment : this green @entity123 coat dress with @entity232 £ 245 brown ‘ @entity255 ’ hat were worn by @entity42 at @entity256 2013			0
what the experts say : ‘ the combination of brown and green are too earthy and detract from her natural style			0
’ @entity263 in yellow : this @entity266 bespoke coat in yellow silk was worn to the @entity268 in may 2013 but @entity38 says : ‘ acid yellow is harsh , bright and overbearing on @entity42			2

according to colour analyst @entity38 , the @entity0 is a ' summer ' which means she has cool - toned skin
colours that look good on her *include* all shades of grey , @entity51 navy , plum , burgundy and soft berry shades
those who boast cool ' winter ' colouring can wear more intense colours such as black , *fuschia* and scarlet
warm - toned ' spring ' and ' autumn ' colouring needs yellow - based shades , for example russet or olive green
