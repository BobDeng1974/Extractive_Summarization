a @entity1 veterinary student who stitched the words ' @entity3 ' onto the skin of a dog and then posted the image on @entity7 to impress his girlfriend is under investigation by university staff			1
the fourth year student from the @entity12 in @entity13 - a city in north east @entity1 - is believed to have been involved an operation on the dog , before using a large number of unnecessary stitches to spell out a message to his girlfriend on the animal 's stomach			1
the university opened an investigation into the incident after the student 's friends reported him for ' grotesque ' and ' unethical ' behaviour			1
' grotesque ' : the @entity1 veterinary student stitched the words ' @entity3 ' onto the skin of a dog and then posted the image on @entity7 in order to impress his girlfriend			1
he is under investigation by university staff the student 's message was written in @entity36 and required a large number of stitches - most of them totally unnecessary as the incision from the animal 's operation was elsewhere on its stomach			2
having carried out the grisly task , the student took photographs of his message before posting them on @entity7 and tagging his girlfriend			0
within minutes the couple 's friends began criticising the photograph , branding the student unethical and describing the photograph as ' grotesque '			2
one person quick to come to his defence , however , was the student 's girlfriend , who asked : ' what 's so unethical about it ? he 's learnt to sew in order to help and is just showing his skill			2
' anger : within minutes of the student posting the message on @entity7 , his friends began criticising the photograph - branding the young man unethical and describing the photograph as ' grotesque ' location : the @entity12 in @entity13 ( pictured ) is now investigating the incident while the student 's girlfriend may have been impressed , @entity73 - head of veterinary studies at the @entity12 - is considerably less so			1
he has now launched a full investigation into the incident , saying : ' we need to find out more about what happened here			0
' ' saying you love someone is not a bad thing , but the fact that this was stitched into the stomach of an animal does seem immoral and unethical behaviour from a student of veterinary science , ' he added			0
' one of the first points of the @entity92 ' @entity91 is that a vet practising his profession of public trust needs professional conduct and good morals , ' mr @entity73 went on to say			0
the university offers a veterinary service for locals including some free treatments to allow students to test their skills under the watchful eye of a qualified professional			0
they are now trying to work out why the student 's ill - advised joke was not stopped by his supervisor .			0
