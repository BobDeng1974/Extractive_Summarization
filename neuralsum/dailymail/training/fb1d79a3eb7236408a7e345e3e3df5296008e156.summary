he was wearing @entity10 - a ' wearable computer ' shaped like eye wear that layers digital information over the real world - which he had his prescription lenses fitted into			2
about one hour into a showing of @entity28 : @entity29 , the man said some ' federal service ' agents snatched the glasses from his face and asked him to leave the theater			1
@entity10 are ' wearable computers ' that were only recently released to a select market			2
they layer information over real life seen like a computer screen on one eye the man said between five to 10 police were waiting outside for him and accused him of illegally taping the movie			1

the man and his wife were taken to a management office inside @entity52 and interviewed separately			2
' i kept telling them that @entity10 has a usb port and not only did i allow them , i actually insist they connect to it and see that there was nothing but personal photos with my wife and my dog on it , ' the man wrote to @entity15			1
' i also insisted they look at my phone too and clear things out , but they wanted to talk first			0
' they wanted to know who i am , where i live , where i work , how much i ’m making , how many computers i have at home , why am i recording the movie , who am i going to give the recording to , why do n’t i just give up the guy up the chain , ’ cause they are not interested in me			0
the incident occurred at this @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity4 , where the man involved in the incident says he goes every week with his wife ' over and over and over again			1
' the man that ' after a long time ' someone came into the office with a laptop and @entity91 cable and searched through the photos on his glasses , which were all of his wife and dog			1
' i asked why did n’t they just take those five minutes at the beginning of the interrogation and they just left the room , ' he wrote			0
' a guy who claimed his name is @entity104 ( he gave me his business card ) came in the room , and said he was with the @entity107 and they have problems with piracy at that specific theater and that specific movie			2

' the @entity149 then contacted @entity6 , which oversees movie theft			0
the investigation determined the guest was not recording content			0

man in @entity18 , @entity4 , was on a movie date with his wife on saturday at the @entity17 cinema they go to once a week
he claims that one hour into the movie he was removed from the theater and that 5 - 10 officers were waiting for him out front

eventually they searched the data on the glasses and realized they were clear
the cinema gave him four free movie *tickets* to *compensate*
