the £ 50million centre forward arrived from @entity8 on deadline day in january 2011 and every season since has seen the @entity12 narrative dominated by talk of whether the big - money flop could lead the line			1
unfortunately for the @entity17 , he never quite managed it - although there were some standout moments in a period that saw him win club silverware for the first time in his career			0
beginning with a performance that saw him substituted in his debut against former club @entity8 , the @entity41 striker found it difficult to adapt to his new surroundings before finally getting off the mark in late april			1
with @entity29 already a goal to the good , @entity48 's through ball sent @entity6 clear on goal , one - on - one with @entity51 but with defenders in pursuit			1

relief : @entity6 runs off and celebrates his goal against @entity33 by blowing a kiss to the @entity29 fans 4 ) real quality with a hat - trick against @entity69 with @entity29 preparing for the @entity72 final , @entity70 gave some of his second - string a chance against struggling @entity69 - and that included @entity6			1
on a rare hark back to his @entity8 days , the hitman managed three of his 20 @entity79 goals in a treble as he ripped apart the @entity69 defence , scoring @entity29 ’s third , fourth and fifth goals in a 6 - 1 rout			1

at the treble : @entity6 scored a hat - trick for @entity29 against @entity92 rivals @entity69 on april 29 , 2012 arms aloft : @entity6 ( right ) is joined by captain @entity94 ( left ) in celebration after netting his hat - trick goal 3 ) taking apart seemingly - unbeatable @entity97 having wildly shot over the bar with just the keeper to beat earlier in the game , @entity6 turned on the style to become @entity29 ’s matchwinner against eventual champions @entity97			2
first , he tore past @entity104 with ease before putting the ball on a plate for @entity108 to score the opener , before @entity110 equalised for @entity97 , and after performing as a real no 9 should on a rare occasion in a @entity29 shirt , he scored the winner			0
it came from a mix - up between @entity117 and @entity118 but @entity6 was on hand to knock the ball into the net before screaming in celebration in front of the @entity12			0
@entity124 later spoke of how @entity6 deserved his chance to win the game with an easy opportunity after a sensational performance - although it again proved to be another false dawn and his name did n’t appear on the scoresheet again for almost two months as @entity29 struggled to find an option upfront			1

he showed a combination of pace and strength to escape the attentions of @entity152 and @entity153 before rounding the goalkeeper and scoring from a tight angle to give his side the lead			0
it was the @entity29 thought they had signed for £ 50m back in 2011 - strong , pacey and able to find the finishing touch			1
the @entity144 was @entity6 ’ most productive competition , but he did well in @entity161 generally for the @entity162 and leaves as their third - highest all - time top @entity161 goalscorer behind only @entity164 and @entity165			2

@entity195 missed a penalty , the woodwork worked in @entity29 ’s favour and @entity198 was on top form but memories of @entity202 ’s last - minute winner two years previous still loomed large in supporters ’ thoughts			2
with the clock ticking down substitute @entity6 tried to alleviate pressure by running out of defence but lost the ball to @entity209 - yet @entity211 ’s desperate clearance then found the no 9 alone just inside his own half			0
sprinting forward , he rounded @entity214 before an ice - cool finish sent @entity29 to @entity217 and wrote @entity218 into @entity12 folklore forever			0
