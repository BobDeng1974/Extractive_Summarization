by @entity0 , science reporter an obsession with being too clean and hygienic could lead to a higher risk of dementia , researchers have warned			2
their study pinpointed a significant relationship between a nation ’s cleanliness and the number of @entity12 ’s patients			1
countries which can afford better sanitation have higher rates of the disease			2
the researchers suggested the ‘ hygiene hypothesis ’ was behind the difference			0
this is the theory that an excessively clean lifestyle leaves our immune systems out of balance and unable to combat many germs			2
it has already been linked to the rise in the number of allergies , such as asthma and eczema			0
one in three @entity26 over 65 will develop dementia			0
@entity12 ’s and other forms of the condition blight the lives of more than 800,000 , with 500 new cases each day			1
lead researcher dr @entity54 , from @entity55 , said : ‘ the hygiene hypothesis is well - established			0
we can now add @entity12 ’s to this list of diseases			1
‘ there are important implications , especially in developing countries as they increase in sanitation			2
’ the study of health data from 192 nations found those with a relatively low risk of infection had more patients with @entity12 ’s			1
clean environments in developed nations result in far less exposure to a diverse range of bacteria ( pictured )			2
this might cause the immune system to develop poorly and could expose the brain to the inflammation associated with @entity12 's disease likewise , better sanitation and urban living were linked with a higher incidence of the disease , irrespective of life expectancy			1
taken together , these factors accounted for 42.5 per cent of the variation in rates of @entity12 ’s between countries			1
dr @entity54 said changes in diet , life expectancy and healthcare could not explain the differences			0
the researchers found that exposure to germs throughout an individual ’s lifetime , not just early on , may affect the risk of dementia			2
a lack of contact upsets the development of white blood cells , particularly those called t - cells , which are a key part of the immune system			0
this imbalance has been linked to the types of inflammation found in the brains of those with @entity12 ’s , said the report in the journal @entity116			1
dr @entity54 added : ‘ we need to find the right balance of exposure			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity121 said : ‘ it is an interesting theory			0
however , it is always difficult to pin causality to one factor			0
’ the best way to cut risk is to eat healthily , exercise , not smoke and keep blood pressure and cholesterol in check , he added			0
countries where more than three - quarters of the population are located in urban areas , such as the @entity26 and @entity136 , had 10 per cent higher rates of @entity12 ’s compared to countries , such as @entity139 and @entity140 , where less than one - tenth of people inhabit urban areas			1
video : dr @entity54 discusses her research on the link between hygiene and @entity12 's overall , differences in levels of sanitation , infectious disease and urbanisation accounted for 33 per cent , 36 per cent and 28 per cent of the variation in @entity12 ’s rate between countries			1
previous research has shown that @entity12 ’s affects fewer people in @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 than it does in @entity160			1
even within those regions , prevalence is lower in urban than in rural areas , according to the new findings			0
the hygiene hypothesis is based on the assumption that lack of contact with ' dirt ' in the form of bacteria and other infectious agents upsets the development of white blood cells , key elements of the immune system			2
in particular , t - cells are said to be affected			0
t - cells have a variety of functions , including attacking and destroying foreign invaders and marshalling other parts of the immune system			0
some , known as ' regulatory ' t - cells , reign in the immune system when it starts to get out of control			0
dysfunctional regulatory t - cells can lead to inflammation and autoimmune disorders			0
regulatory t - cell deficiency is linked to the type of inflammation commonly found in the brains of people with @entity12 ’s disease			1
today , more than 50 per cent of people with @entity12 's live in the developing world , and by 2025 it is expected that this figure will rise to more than 70 per cent ‘ exposure to microorganisms is critical for the regulation of the immune system , ’ wrote the researchers			1
they added that , since increasing global urbanisation beginning at the turn of the 19th century , the populations of many of the world ’s wealthier nations have increasingly very little exposure to the so - called ‘ friendly ’ microbes due to ‘ diminishing contact with animals , faeces and soil			2
’ ‘ the increase in adult life expectancy and @entity12 ’s prevalence in developing countries is perhaps one of the greatest challenges of our time , ’ said dr @entity54			1
‘ today , more than 50 per cent of people with @entity12 ’s live in the developing world , and by 2025 it is expected that this figure will rise to more than 70 per cent			1
‘ a better understanding of how environmental sanitation influences @entity12 ’s risk could open up avenues for both lifestyle and pharmaceutical strategies to limit @entity12 ’s prevalence			1
’ the hygiene hypothesis is normally thought to be most relevant in childhood , when the immune system is still developing			0
but in the case of @entity12 ’s , exposure to microbes across a person ’s lifetime might be important , say the scientists			1
this is because regulatory t - cell numbers peak at various points in life , for example at adolescence and middle age			0
the results of the study are published by the journal @entity116 .			2

study looked at link between cleanliness and @entity12 's in 192 countries
countries with clean *drinking* water have 9 *%* higher @entity12 ’s rates
countries with less infectious disease have 12 per cent more *alzheimer* ’s
