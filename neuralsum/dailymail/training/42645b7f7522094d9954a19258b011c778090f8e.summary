a unique collection of images beautifully illustrating the southern hemisphere 's most amazing wildlife will be featured in an @entity5 gallery exhibition throughout october and november			1
photographers from across the globe will be vying for the @entity5 @entity9 award , which recognises the most outstanding images taken from @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 across 10 categories			1
curators from the @entity18 will exhibit the works from october 10 , before a winner is awarded the top prize of $ 10,000			1

@entity31 manager @entity30 said : ' every image offers the viewer an opportunity to explore a new region or discover a new species they might never otherwise be introduced to			2
' he said the competition encourages awareness of biodiversity and conservation in a fascinating and important part of the world			2
the editor - in - chief of australian geographic @entity45 said : ' this year 's shortlist delivers a powerful statement about the diversity of the @entity50 as perfectly executed portraits of miniscule invertebrates stand side by side with awe inspiring images of our largest and most majestic marine mammals			2
@entity58 : as these nankeen kestrels mate , the male balances on the female ’s back with its claws pointed inward , careful not to pierce the female ’s delicate skin			2

stunned @entity69 : an eastern osprey takes to the air with a large mullet in its talons			2
ospreys carry their prey parallel while in flight , reducing air resistance			2
@entity78 , @entity5 @entity9 competition a mid-air drink : @entity81 temperatures exceeded @entity82 for weeks and the wildlife was severely stressed			1
for thirsty birds , a dripping tap was an irresistible attraction			2
some timed their approach with enough precision to snatch drops in mid-air			2
@entity92 , @entity5 @entity9 competition @entity93 hovering : i followed a pair of nankeen kestrels which nested near a deserted soccer field			1
when their young fledged , they practised their hunting skills close to the nesting site , typically hovering about 10 - 20 metres above the field searching for insects and other small creatures			2
@entity67 , @entity5 @entity9 competition regent flight : this male regent bowerbird was photographed at @entity109 ’s @entity108 where these birds are used to people and offer great photo opportunities			1
only the male has the beautiful bright colours			0
he typically builds a big bower where he tries to impress the females and mate with as many of them as possible during the breeding season			0
@entity67 , @entity5 @entity9 competition soldier @entity119 : these soldier crabs were poised near the entrance to a burrow			1
it looked as though they were comparing body size , and the clear disparity between them meant that the conflict was resolved without a fight			0
similarly sized rivals tend to fight to determine who is going to occupy a burrow			0
@entity67 , @entity5 @entity9 competition @entity5 emperor dragonfly : @entity5 emperor dragonflies are large , fiercely territorial and are found all over @entity12			1
i spotted this individual sitting poised for take - off among the plants in my grandparents ’ garden			0
@entity141 , @entity5 @entity9 competition fluorescent landscape : starry cup coral shows its colouration at high magnification under full - spectrum lights			1
corals , similarly to numerous other tropical marine invertebrates , owe their remarkable colours to special fluorescent pigments			0
fluorescent colours become apparent only under natural underwater illumination			0
@entity153 , @entity5 @entity9 competition some you win and some you lose : the egrets that come in to fish on the mudflats near the @entity157 each evening are able to pluck fish after fish from the shallow waters with an alarming rate of success			1
as worrying as this must be for the fish , it sets the scene for some amazing photographs			0
@entity168 , @entity5 @entity9 competition newborn : this smooth - skinned , newborn calf was less than a day old			1
you can still see the folds where it had been tightly wrapped in a foetal position			0
@entity174 , @entity5 @entity9 competition collective : hidden away on the coast of @entity12 , the town of @entity177 is home to a number of @entity5 sea lion colonies			1
young females congregate on the beaches in harems controlled by a large single male or beach master			0
@entity174 , @entity5 @entity9 competition praise to the rain : the other roos had seen this many times and merely sat drenched and depressed waiting for the storm to pass			1
the young bucks had something to prove , rearing back onto their tails to intimidate each other into submission			0
@entity196 , @entity5 @entity9 competition @entity197 : a poignant reminder of the controversy created by the sport of game fishing and the emotional reaction that such a sight can provoke			1
however , this mako shark did not die in vain , as it was used for scientific research on the species			0
@entity209 , @entity5 @entity9 competition @entity210 at @entity211 : i was taking photos of the @entity214 at night when i noticed this cicada on a nearby tree			1
preparing my camera , i waited for the perfect moment when the elegant cicada filled the frame			0
@entity221 , @entity5 @entity9 competition back from fishing : a pair of eastern ospreys took up fishing in my local river for two weeks			1
after finding their favourite fishing spot , i spent a few hours taking photographs of them while i was cloaked in camouflage			0
@entity232 , @entity5 @entity9 competition blizzard : i was a member of the @entity234 on the @entity236 fast ice when a nasty blizzard arrived			1
as we made our way to the safety of our ship , the dark shapes of a huddle of @entity241 penguins could just be discerned amid the starkly beautiful icy landscape			0
@entity247 , @entity5 @entity9 competition beach quokkas : i found these two quokkas on the beach at sunset foraging for food			1
they were not shy towards people , no doubt used to being fed. coming in looking for scraps , they got so curious that later i had to clean off little nose marks they had left on my lens			0
@entity196 , @entity5 @entity9 competition @entity5 @entity9 competition @entity260 : i took this photo of a ghost gum around @entity263 in gibber country			1
it was early morning and the rocks in the foreground cast big , long shadows			0
i like that the roots stick out like a person ’s remains are there ; it makes it a real ghost gum			0
@entity275 , @entity5 @entity9 competition houseboat : these old boats left in @entity15 are a reminder of its terrible whaling past			1
the boats were abandoned with no thought of their impact on the environment			0
at @entity286 , these @entity285 penguins have embraced a decaying whale boat as their own while they shed their adolescent down feathers			0
@entity290 , @entity5 @entity9 competition the surfacing : a humpback whale surfaces on the northern @entity294 migration			1
the whale had begun to exhale before breaking the surface , leaving a progressive trail of bubbles			0
@entity299 , @entity5 @entity9 competition @entity300 : i had been trying to capture images of these waratah anemones for several weeks but had n’t had the perfect day			1
on this particular day the morning mist created a beautiful sun halo , and , as i took this shot , a gull flew right through the @entity309 ’s orb			0
@entity310 , @entity5 @entity9 competition princess parrot : @entity312 in @entity313 has a flock of seven princess parrots that fly free around the urban zoo			1
surveying them in the wild is very difficult as they are highly nomadic ; it is believed that the captive population now outnumbers those left in the wild			0
@entity324 , @entity5 @entity9 competition			2
salinity by @entity326 : during winter this parched lake gains water that runs down from surrounding paddocks which have all been cleared for crops			0
without any exit creeks , it sits still and slowly evaporates during summer , with salt growths and crystals forming on the dead trees			0
