women are still paid less then men across the @entity3 and @entity4 for doing exactly the same job , damning figures reveal			1
hourly pay rates for women across @entity4 are on average 16 per cent lower than for men doing the same work and 19.5 per cent lower in the @entity3 , latest figures reveal today			1
the gap was highlighted on the eve of @entity12 - a moveable annual event marked this year on february 28 - the 59th day of the year reflecting the number of extra days women must work to earn ' equal ' pay			2
regardless of whether they do the same job , men get paid more on average than their female counterparts the situation is improving , the @entity19 hastened to point out today : the first @entity12 , in 2011 , was held on march 5 and last year it was on march 2			0
that reflects a closing of the pay gap from 17.5 per cent to 16			1
per cent over three years with today ’s latest figures reflecting the position across @entity4 in 2010			2
the biggest gender pay gap is nearly 28 per cent in @entity27 , with the @entity3 's 19.5 per cent the eighth biggest in the 27 member states			1
@entity30 ’s pay gap is at 13.9 per cent and the lowest is @entity31 ’s 0.9 per cent			1
' @entity32 reminds us of the unequal pay conditions women still face in the labour market , ' said @entity37 and fundamental rights commissioner @entity38			0
' while the pay gap has declined in the recent years , there ’s no reason to celebrate			1
the pay gap is still very large and much of the change actually resulted from a decline in men ’s earnings rather than an increase for women			1
' she added : ' the principle of equal pay for equal work is written in the @entity53 since 1957			0
it is high time that it is put in practice everywhere			0

it may reflect the economic downturn ’s impact primarily on male - dominated sectors such as construction and engineering			0
the issue will be discussed next month at a gathering of more than 150 companies in @entity96 to exchange equal pay ' best practice '			0
a commission report on tightening @entity53 equal pay rules and on how companies should conduct ' gender - neutral job evaluation and job classification systems ' is due to be published in the summer			2
@entity96 also wants @entity53 governments to organise their own ' national equal pay days ' to put the spotlight on the need for pay parity between the sexes			0
but while @entity3 women may be paid almost a fifth less compared to their male colelagues , they have more in the bank , despite being paid less than men , women savers have about £ 500 more in the bank than their male counterparts , according to the @entity119			2
in terms of share of wages , the gap is still more striking : women have 41 per cent of their annual salary in savings , while men have just 23 per cent			2
the bank says the average man among its account holders has saved up £ 7,699 – against £ 8,211 , or £ 512 more , for women			0
the finding holds true in all regions across @entity133 and @entity134			0
the @entity136 analysis , which is based on figures from the @entity138 , says the pay gap also translates into smaller pensions			1
it found that women aged from 50 to 59 endure the widest gender pay gap of any age group			1
in their 20s , women typically earn more than men and in their 30s they fall only slightly behind			0
but the gap grows rapidly in their 40s and reaches a peak in their 50s .			0

the biggest gender pay gap is nearly 28 per cent in @entity27
@entity3 's 19.5 per cent gap is the eighth biggest in the 27 member states
