@entity0 was an isolated figure , and here is his heat map another spell - binding afternoon to further light up this thrill - a - minute @entity5			2
in the end , though , it is hard to conclude that this one taught us much we did n’t already know			2
@entity10 remain the consummate tournament team			1
when were n’t they ? this was their seventh consecutive victory in opening matches at the @entity5			2
on five of those occasions they have scored four goals			2
really , we should not be surprised			0
@entity21 , meanwhile , are a skittish collection of individuals			0
some are talented and some really are not			0
at the heart of their ordinary defence is @entity30 ’s thuggish @entity29			1
sent off here , we may not see him again this tournament and we shall not miss him			0

goals : @entity34 12 ( pen ) , 45 , 78 , @entity50 32 @entity21 : @entity72 5.5 ; @entity73 5 , @entity74 5 , @entity29 2 , @entity75 4.5 ( a @entity76 65 , 5.5 ) ; @entity77 5 , @entity78 5 ( @entity79 45 , 5 ) , @entity80 5 ; @entity81 6 , @entity82 5 ( @entity83 23 , 5 ) , @entity0 5			1

man of the match : @entity34			1
referee : @entity96 ( @entity97 ) match ratings by @entity99 it appears @entity0 ’s dream year will not be capped by a rampage across @entity103			0
he was modest at best yesterday but it was hard to blame him			0
any talent — no matter how divine — needs a platform on which to function			0
he is a diamond surrounded by some pretty ugly rocks and even if @entity21 do recover to beat @entity110 and @entity111 it is hard to imagine them moving beyond the last 16			0
that can not be said of @entity10			1
this was a remarkable performance on a devastatingly hot day			0
certainly they were helped by @entity29 ’s dismissal , delivered by @entity97 referee @entity96 for a mindless butt on @entity34			1
@entity21 manager @entity118 appeared to question the referee ’s objectivity in deciding to send @entity29 off			1
@entity10 were already two goals to the good by that time , anyway			1
all @entity29 ’s act of madness did was allow them to ease off a little with almost an hour left to play			1
such was the @entity38 superiority that @entity54 was able to play 90 minutes when the plan had been to take him off after 45			0
he was superb — so , too , @entity59 and , of course , @entity34			1
@entity10 played with purpose and identity			1
as he did four years ago , @entity133 — their splendidly understated coach — appears to have brought them to the start line in prime condition			0
not much in it : @entity34 ( left ) is caught by @entity29 's flailing arm duirng the first half over-reaction : @entity34 goes over the top after being caught by @entity29 's flailing arm theatrics : @entity34 ( left ) flings himself to the floor holding his face as @entity29 plays on argument : @entity29 has a go at @entity34 following the incident seeing red : @entity29 butts @entity34 while the @entity38 is sat on the floor and is sent off startled : @entity34 reacts in shock and disbelief after @entity29 's ridiculous headbutt squaring up : @entity34 angrily reacts after the @entity21 defender 's act of violence off you go : @entity29 ( second right ) is sent off as @entity34 ( left ) is held back by team - mate @entity55 early on , @entity21 briefly threatened			1
one scamper down the left by @entity0 allowed @entity76 to shoot tamely at @entity48 , while another break saw the @entity21 captain drive in a low effort			0
@entity118 ’s team never seemed to settle across their own back line , however , and they almost gifted @entity10 the lead very early on			1
a back pass which @entity29 played without looking took goalkeeper @entity72 away from his line			2
when his hurried , scuffed clearance landed at @entity54 ’s feet 35 yards from goal , the @entity30 midfielder struck the ball first time only to see it pass outside the post by a few inches			0
soon afterwards came @entity10 ’s opening goal			2
perhaps @entity59 was leaning in to @entity73 a little as the two men tussled in the area , but the @entity181 defender did seem to have a grip of his opponent			2
after @entity59 fell down , @entity34 stepped up to stroke the penalty in			1
three and easy : @entity34 ( centre ) lashes home @entity10 's third and put them in total control @entity34 's second goal - and @entity10 's third , put the tin lid on it ... click here for more from our brilliant @entity194 sealing victory : @entity34 's second and @entity10 's third heading for an easy win : @entity50 ( second right ) rises to nod in @entity10 's second goal @entity201 : @entity50 ( right ) makes straight for the @entity10 substitutes after scoring roar of delight : @entity34 celebrates putting @entity10 1 - 0 up early on in @entity206 spot on : @entity34 dispatches the penalty into the corner with ease to set @entity10 on their way out of reach : @entity21 keeper @entity72 dives but can get nowhere near @entity34 's penalty foul : @entity59 ( centre ) is brought down by @entity73 ( right ) for @entity10 's early penalty so early in the game , it already looked a long way back for @entity21 and , in their own half at least , things quickly deteriorated			1
@entity59 looked about to score in the 31st minute as he moved on to @entity57 ’s low cross , only for @entity73 to divert the shot over with his knee			0
it was a fine block but one that was rendered irrelevant within 30 seconds as @entity50 rose above @entity29 to thump in a header from the resulting corner			1
two down now , @entity21 certainly seemed doomed			0
by half - time they were			2
twice in a minute they came close to scoring as @entity75 inexplicably chose not to shoot when clear and then substitute @entity83 — on for the injured @entity76 — headed a corner over			2
almost immediately @entity29 contributed his piece of madness and @entity10 were left with a man advantage			1
perhaps the arm in the face of @entity34 was not quite enough to put the @entity38 on the seat of his pants			1
but @entity29 is no stranger to a bit of method acting himself and the decision to follow up with a nudge of his head was ridiculous			2
within seconds he was back in the dressing room			0
isolated : @entity0 cuts a frustrated figure as @entity21 collapse in the first half keeping him out : @entity50 ( right ) goes to block a @entity0 shot on goal it 's one on one : @entity0 faces up @entity34 and attempts to beat the @entity10 forward facing facts : @entity0 's kit including his shin pad with his mug on it ( left picture , bottom right ) and warming up before the @entity10 match ( right ) all that remained now was to see how much more pain @entity10 could inflict			1
quite a bit as it turned out			0
@entity34 poked in the third just before half time after anticipating well to block a @entity74 clearance and @entity34 was able to score his third when @entity72 could n’t hold an @entity58 effort with 15 minutes left			1
by this time , @entity75 had departed with what looked to be a serious thigh injury and @entity21 ’s misery was complete			0
they do n’t look like they will be with us for long			0
@entity10 , on the other hand , have started with menace once again .			2

@entity34 put @entity10 1 - 0 up from penalty spot
@entity50 made it two with a header from a corner
@entity29 was sent off for butting @entity34 on the ground following an *altercation*
@entity34 made it three with a snapshot from inside the area
forward completed his hat - trick from close range in second half
