by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:22 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 13:21 est , 22 april 2013 @entity3 , speaking today in @entity2 , insisted he would press ahead with nursing reforms @entity3 today vowed to face down opposition from nursing leaders to plans to force students to spend a year helping patients eat , wash and get dressed			1
a war of words has erupted over the plan to send trainee nurses have a year working as healthcare assistants			1
the row over-shadowed an announcement by @entity18 leader @entity17 of a fresh reorganisation of the @entity20 if he wins the next election			1
the @entity22 branded it a ‘ really stupid idea ’ but the prime minister insisted the health service had to refocus on care and not just chasing targets and budgets			1
the back - to - basics approach was announced after claims that many trainee nurses , educated to degree - level , consider themselves ‘ too posh to wash ’			1
ministers insist ‘ hands - on caring experience ’ is just as important as academic training			0
the idea emerged in the wake of the @entity41 scandal in which up to 1,200 needlessly died as a result of poor care			1
speaking during an event in @entity2 , mr @entity3 refused to back down			0
he said : ‘ so there ’s a big row going on today which is about the @entity20 and the future of nursing			2
‘ we ’ve said that nurses should spend some time when they ’re training as healthcare assistants in the hospital , really making sure that they are focused on the caring and the quality and some of the quite mundane tasks that are absolutely vital to get right in hospital			1
‘ it ’s going to be controversial			0
but in the end the sort of health service we want is not just about making sure we ’ve got the facts and the figures and the money and everything else spent well , it ’s the level of care so when our elderly relatives go in there , we know they ’re going to get a really good quality of care			0
the scheme could eventually be extended beyond nursing in the future , meaning doctors would have to spend time learning hands - on care			0
but the idea has been savaged by the @entity22			2
critics say the proposals lack crucial details , such as how the @entity20 could 21,000 extra student nurses each year , and who would assess them			1
the @entity22 says the plan is ' stupid ' and will cost too much money ( file picture ) @entity22 president @entity103 said the policy was a ‘ waste of money ’			1
she added : ‘ it demonstrates the lack of understanding the government has regarding the requirements of modern nursing			0
it is a waste of taxpayers ’ money that will have no benefit to patients			0
it ’s a really stupid idea			1
’ the row puts the government on a collision course with nurses , which carries big political risks			0
but health secretary @entity122 insisted that many nurses supported the plan , while pointing out that the @entity22 had come in for criticism in the @entity126 into @entity127			1
‘ i think the @entity22 of nurses has to be very , very careful			2
they missed what happened at @entity127 , ’ he told @entity128			2
‘ the @entity132 report levelled some very serious criticisms at that			0
it said that they basically allowed their trade union responsibilities to trump their responsibilities as a @entity22 to raise professional standards			2
‘ they have a conflict of interests and i think that , before they start criticising the government for accepting recommendations that are going to improve compassionate care throughout the @entity20 , they need to answer those very , very serious criticisms themselves			2
‘ what nurses on the front line are saying , a lot of them , particularly the older nurses , is that this was part of nursing training			0
why would you want to become a nurse if you were unwilling to spend time washing patients , feeding patients , doing that really vital experience on the front line ? ‘ we need people to go into nursing with the right motives			0
actually having that frontline hands - on experience is a good thing to do			0
’ the row came as mr @entity17 warned of a multi-billion pound black hole in @entity20 funding to meet the care needs of an ageing population unless there is reform			1
under the @entity18 plans more care will be provided directly in people 's homes , there will be a greater focus on prevention and better co-ordination between different branches of the system			1
labour leader @entity17 returned to his wooden pallet to give a speech in @entity188 , @entity189 today mr @entity17 said the health service needed to be overhauled to deal with a budget black hole speaking to a crowd of about 60 people from a wooden pallet in @entity188 , he said : ' if we can bring together the way the health service works with the way the social care works we can make a huge change in the care we give to elderly people			2
' how many people here know of elderly people who end up in hospital when they do n't really need to be in hospital ? they are only in hospital because they have nowhere else to go			0
' let 's have health and social care working together so it keeps elderly people out of hospital and saves the health service money			0
