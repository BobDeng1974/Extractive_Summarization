by @entity0 published : 07:52 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 09:03 est , 26 july 2013 rumours have resurfaced about a device being developed by @entity3 that could act as an interpreter			1
@entity3 's gadget would not be quite as high - tech as those seen in science fiction shows such as @entity9 and @entity10 , but could convert spoken words into another language in real - time through a receiver			1
@entity3 's vice president of @entity16 , @entity17 , told @entity18 the device is an option and more recent developments in its @entity21 software could make it a reality			1
@entity3 's universal translator could work in a similar way to the devices used by @entity26 , pictured left played by @entity27 and bones , played by @entity29 in @entity9 alternatively , the device could be fitted to people 's clothes as seen in @entity9 : the @entity32 , pictured			1
in the show , @entity34 devices were fitted to the communication pins of the crew including @entity38 and @entity39 the universal translator ( @entity34 ) was a device used in @entity9 to translate alien languages			1
in the early series of @entity9 , the @entity43 were shaped like tubes			0
in @entity9 : enterprise the @entity43 looked similar to a flip phone			2
in @entity9 : next generation , uts are built into the communication pins on @entity51 uniforms			0
@entity52 , including @entity53 from @entity54 , have implants in their ear from birth			0
one exception is the @entity60 language , which mostly ca n't be translated			2
@entity17 told @entity18 : ' we 've got tons of protoypes of that sort of interaction and i 've played it every other week to see how much progress we 've made			0
' but he added that the software is still several years away from being ready			2
@entity17 also explained that some translations are ' near - perfect ' , such as @entity71 to @entity72 , while others are not			2
@entity75 translation devices were a common feature across the different @entity9 series			2
@entity78 , a communications officer on the @entity79 in @entity9 : @entity79 , uses the translator to invent the linguacode matrix			2
by the 24th century , universal translators are built into the communicator pins worn by @entity51 personnel and the ferengi race wear their universal translators as implants in their ears			0
in the @entity91 book , @entity10 , a small fish is inserted into the ear of a person			0
it can then read mental frequencies and translate conversations			0
@entity3 's plans first emerged in 2010 when @entity98 , @entity3 's head of translation services , hinted that speech - to - speech translation should be possible ' in a few year 's time			1
' @entity3 's translate app , as well as other apps on the market , can already translate text from one language to another			1
they can also translate speech into text , yet they are not capable of converting speech to speech at the moment and voice translation has its limitations			1
in the @entity91 book , @entity10 , a small fish that acts like an interpreter is inserted into the ear of a person			0
dubbed @entity119 , pictured , it can then read mental frequencies and translate conversations @entity52 , such as @entity53 pictured from the tv series @entity123 , are fitted with universal translation devices in their ears at birth voice - recognition on the apps and software also needs to be developed because background noise or poor microphones affects the accuracy of the recognition			1
@entity21 currently works with 71 languages , but there are around 6,000 languages worldwide leaving the service a little short			0
in february last year , @entity98 admitted that any universal translation devices would also need to adapt to its user by ' learning ' their style of talking			1
' everyone has a different voice , accent and pitch , ' said mr @entity98			0
' but recognition should be effective with mobile phones because by nature they are personal to you			0
' recent developments in the @entity21 software , pictured , could make a universal translation device a reality			1
@entity21 currently works with 71 languages , but there are around 6,000 languages worldwide leaving the service a little short			0
