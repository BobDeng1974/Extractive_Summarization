girls will be boys and boys will be girls , but a little - known @entity5 insect takes role reversal to a whole new level			2
the cave - dwelling @entity9 female sports an impressive ‘ penis ’ , which she uses to mate with her male partner			1
and bizarrely he is blessed with what the researchers describe as a ‘ much - reduced , vagina - like opening			2
' a little - known @entity5 insect takes role reversal to a whole new level , scientists have learned			2
the cave - dwelling @entity9 female sports an impressive penis , which she uses to ' mate ' with her male partner as if that does not make the @entity5 insect 's sex life interesting enough , copulation between the two sexes can last up to 70 hours			1
' although sex - role reversal has been identified in several different animals , @entity9 is the only example in which the intromittent organ is also reversed , ' said lead scientist dr @entity32 , from @entity33 in @entity34			1
a study of four species of the @entity9 genus showed that the penis - like structure of the female , called a gynosome , is inserted into males and used to receive capsules of nutrient and sperm			1
once within a male , part of the gynosome inflates and projects spines which anchor the two insects together			0
the scientists found it impossible to pull coupling males and females apart without causing injury			1
their description of @entity9 's strange mating habits is published in the journal @entity58			2
scientists described four insect species that dwell in extremely dry caves in @entity5 , feed on bat guano and possess what the researchers called an ' evolutionary novelty			0
' the females have an elaborate , penis - like organ while the males have a vagina - like opening into which females insert their organ during mating sessions that last 40 to 70 hours			1
the researchers said these attributes make the four species of the insect genus @entity9 unique in the world			1
' evolution of novelties like a female penis is exceptionally rare			0
that 's why i was really surprised to see the structure , ' @entity32 said			0
these are @entity9 curvata insects in copula , which can last for up to 70 hours			1
the @entity9 insects are small - 0.1 to 0.15 inches long ( 2.5 to 3.8 mm ) - and superficially look like flies @entity32 said that although sex - role reversal has been documented in several different types of animals , these insects are the sole example in which the ' intromittent organ ' - the male sex organ - is reversed			1
the @entity9 insects are small - 0.1 to 0.15 inches long ( 2.5 to 3.8 millimetres ) - and superficially look like flies , with nothing particularly unusual about their appearance aside from their genital structures			1
in other penis - related news , a man from @entity103 announced he needs money to save his pet tortoise			0
four - year - old tortoise @entity108 has a prolapsed penis			0
the condition can be caused by mating injuries or constant arousal			0
owner @entity114 says he ca n't afford the operation - which could involve a tuck or complete amputation - and is hoping well - wishers will donate			0
@entity32 said the females of @entity9 can hold male mates coercively using their gynosome			0
' because the female anchoring force is very strong , a male 's strong resistance may cause damage to his genitalia , ' @entity32 said			0
' therefore , it is very likely that entire mating processes are controlled actively by females , whereas males are rather passive			0
' a @entity5 researcher who was studying cave ecosystems first came across the insects , then enlisted an insect expert to examine the previously unknown bugs			2
it was at that point that the unique attributes of the female @entity9 were discovered , leading to the current study			1
@entity32 cited other unusual examples of sex organs among animals , including female seahorses that use an organ to deposit eggs within a male 's brood pouch and a kind of mite whose females have a long genital tube			0
by the definition of female - an organism that produces egg cells that are larger than the sperm cells produced by males - ' even with the penis - like intromittent organ , females of @entity9 are still female , ' @entity32 said			1
but @entity32 added : ' females of @entity9 likely represent the most " macho " females among animals discovered to date			2

scientists have discovered a cave - dwelling insect that has roles reversed
the female insects sport a ' penis ' while the males have a ' vagina '
@entity175 between the two sexes can last a *mammoth* 70 hours
the coupling pair can also not be pulled apart without injury
these attributes make the insect class @entity9 unique in the world
