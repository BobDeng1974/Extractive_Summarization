by @entity1 reporter published : 14:21 est , 6 february 2014 @entity3 : 15:11 est , 6 february 2014 @entity5 's current drought is being billed as the driest period in the state 's recorded rainfall history			1
a pair of satellite images released by @entity11 reveal the shocking impact of @entity5 's drought , which is now entering its third year			1
the @entity15 images show how the state 's landscape is parched with minimal snow cover and the land dried out compared to the same time last year			2
@entity29 urged @entity5 to conserve water , warning that the state faces potential water shortages , crop losses , and an increase in wildfires if significant precipitation does n't come soon			1
the images , captured on @entity11 ’s @entity41 satellite , show a steep decline in snow cover across the @entity44 , @entity45 , and @entity46			0
both the @entity48 and @entity49 valleys appeared parched , with a noticeable drop in greenness			0
dry year : governor @entity29 holds a chart showing statewide average precipitation as he speaks during a news conference today in @entity56 after declaring a drought state of emergency for @entity5 parched : a warning buoy sits on the dry , cracked bed of @entity60 near @entity61 , @entity5 despite recent spot rains the reservoir is currently only about 37 percent full in @entity64 , one of the two water sources for the city of @entity68 , @entity5 in the midst of a historic drought , the reservoir is only one - third full , forcing @entity68 city leaders to ban lawn watering , car washing , and mandated all residents to cut water use the most striking difference between the two years is the amount of snow cover on mountains			1
the @entity44 range has very little snow , and @entity45 and @entity46 are almost completely snow free , ' said @entity11 in a post on the @entity85 section of its @entity87 web site			0
' @entity5 gets a third of its water supply from mountain snow , but with warm , dry weather , little snow has accumulated			2
' ' less striking at first glance , but just as telling is the condition of the vegetation west of the @entity44			0
in 2013 — a year into the drought — the central valley was green with growing crops			0
the coastal hills were also green from winter rain			0
in 2014 , everything west of the forested mountains is brown			0
even irrigated agriculture in the center of the state appears to be limited compared to 2013			0
' a sign outside a market in @entity68 , @entity5 , reminds passerby 's about about the short water supply facing area residents			2
in the midst of a historic drought and area reservoirs holding less than a 100 - day supply of water , @entity68 city leaders have banned lawn watering , car washing and mandated all residents to cut water use land is exposed by the extremely low water level of @entity123 on february 5 , 2014 near @entity124 , @entity5			1
now in its third straight year of unprecedented drought , @entity5 is experiencing its driest year on record , dating back 119 years and possible the worst in the past 500 years			2
docks float on extremely low - level water in @entity123 on february 5 , 2014 near @entity124 , @entity5			2
about 17 rural communities could run out of drinking water within several weeks and politicians are are pushing to undo laws that protect several endangered species @entity5 in 2013 received less rain than in any year since it became a state in 1850			2
and at least one @entity137 scientist says that based on tree ring data , the current rainfall season is on pace to be the driest since 1580 — more than 150 years before @entity141 was born			0
a megadrought today would have catastrophic effects			0
@entity5 , the nation 's most populous state with 38 million residents , has built a massive economy , @entity147 , @entity148 and millions of acres of farmland , all in a semiarid area			2
the state 's dams , canals and reservoirs have never been tested by the kind of prolonged drought that experts say will almost certainly occur again			1
the dry year @entity5 experienced in 2013 has left fresh water reservoirs with a fraction of their normal reserves and slowed the normally full @entity162 so dramatically that brush and dry riverbed are showing through in areas normally teeming with fish			1
' we ca n't make it rain , but we can be much better prepared for the terrible consequences that @entity5 's drought now threatens , including dramatically less water for our farms and communities and increased fires in both urban and rural areas , ' governor @entity29 , a @entity168 , said in a statement			1
' i 've declared this emergency and i 'm calling all @entity5 to conserve water in every way possible , ' he said , in a move that will allow him to call for conservation measures and provide flexibility in deciding state water priorities			1
in a sign of the severity of the drought , some of the state 's reservoirs are at their lowest levels in years			1
the @entity194 near @entity48 is so low that the remains of a @entity195 - era ghost town - flooded to create the lake in the 1950s - are visible for the first time in years			0
the state 's mountain ranges , where runoff from melting snow provides much of the water for @entity5 's thirsty cities and farms , have just 20 per cent of the snow they normally have at this time of year , officials noted			1
@entity123 : grasslands that support cattle have dried up , forcing ranchers to feed them expensive supplemental hay to keep them from starving or to sell at least some of their herds , and farmers are struggling with diminishing crop water and what to plant or whether to tear out permanent crops which use water year - round such , as almond trees @entity5 , the nation 's most populous state with 38 million residents , has built a massive economy , @entity147 , @entity148 and millions of acres of farmland , all in a semiarid area			1
the state 's dams , canals and reservoirs have never been tested by the kind of prolonged drought that experts say will almost certainly occur again parched : water levels for many of @entity5 's major reservoirs are well below average and dropping ; concern is mounting that @entity5 may be headed for a replay of the big drought of the late 1980s through the early 1990s , or even worse , 1977 @entity241 , the largest reservoir in @entity5 , is down from its historical average by nearly half			1
other sources of water , including the massive @entity247 , are also affected , prompting cities to dip into reserves and forcing farmers to scramble			0
some public agencies may be able to purchase just five per cent of the water that they contracted to buy from the state			0
adding to concerns , january and february are usually the wettest months in much of the state , but 2014 has so far been mostly dry , with little precipitation expected , according to the @entity257			0
in declaring a drought emergency , @entity29 said he did not know if he would be successful in persuading the federal government to free up funds for drought relief but he would try his best			1
' it 's important , first of all , to awaken all @entity5 to the serious matter of drought , ' he said , also warning of upcoming ' conflicts and different perceptions on how water is to be allocated			1
' @entity268 has long been a contentious issue in @entity5 , where it has been diverted from mountain lakes and streams to irrigate farms and slake the thirst of metropolitan areas			0
many of the state 's efforts to deal with the problem are controversial , including a $ 25 billion plan to divert water from above the delta by sending it through a pair of huge tunnels			1
for many in the state 's $ 44.7 billion agriculture business , water scarcity is a problem made worse by a recent switch to orchard - style crops such as almonds and olives			1
unlike vegetables or cotton , which grow in fields that can be left fallow in dry years , the trees need water every year			0
already , there were signs of competing priorities among groups that contend for water and will be closely watching how state officials use their new flexibility in allocating it			0
assemblywoman @entity305 , the leader of the @entity307 minority in the @entity308 who represents a heavily agricultural area in central @entity5 , expressed hope that with the declaration more water could go toward ' @entity147 farmers and workers who depend on water to feed the world			2
' low and dropping : governor @entity29 points to images showing the snow depth in the @entity321 mountains on january 13 , 2013 ( left ) and january 13 , 2014 ( center ) while declaring a drought state of emergency in @entity56 @entity324 , executive director of the @entity325 , said his group 's concern was for the health of salmon and a fishing industry that supports tens of thousands of jobs in @entity5 and @entity332			1
' if the drought declaration results in more attention to saving the salmon that are in the @entity338 rivers , and which are in dire need of attention , then that is good thing , ' he said			0
@entity342 , an attorney at the @entity343 , said @entity5 has a complex system that allocates water to areas that laid claim to it first - often over 100 years ago - and which many view the system as unfair			2
' because it 's so contentious , there are times when it 's hard to make progress , ' @entity342 said			0
but in some ways the state has done well			0
over the last 40 years , the state 's agriculture industry has doubled the revenue per drop of water used , largely from improved efficiency and changes in the plants grown , @entity342 said .			1

governor @entity29 has declared a drought emergency
@entity5 is seeking federal aid as the state 's water reservoirs fall dangerously low
agricultural and farming areas as well as urban areas face dire consequences
