on the day of his arrival at @entity2 in june 2012 , @entity0 struck an emotive theme , telling stories of afternoons at his grand - father ’s house in @entity8 spent watching the great @entity2 teams of the 1970s and ’ 80s competing in domestic cup finals			1
@entity0 has , it must be said , always had an understanding of the importance of domestic silverware to the club			2
on wednesday night at @entity16 , he must only hope his modern @entity2 side can raise themselves above recent modest levels and take another step towards a @entity21 final that could yet go some way to rescuing his season			1
@entity0 set his side the objective of winning a trophy and finishing inside the top four @entity2 have lost ground in the race for the @entity31 places and will find it hard to recover @entity33 ( left ) and @entity34 look on as @entity0 give a talk to his players and staff @entity39 's record against top - flight opposition speaking ahead of the replay at @entity39 , @entity0 would not go so far as to say the @entity42 could save this campaign for @entity2			1
he can not be seen to be writing off his team ’s top - four @entity44 hopes just yet			2
nevertheless , an fa cup final would be more than useful , for all kinds of reasons			1
‘ i do n’t want to go down the route of saying that it saves our season , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ our objective at the start , though , was to win a trophy			2
‘ so i think if we did n’t get in the top four and we did n’t have a trophy this year , we would be disappointed			2
i think certainly the @entity42 would give us a great boost as a team with lots of young players and players coming into the club			1
‘ that ’s the expectancy we want			0
we want to be able to be challenging every year			0
‘ that was the key thing for me , to get the group challenging at the top end of the league and for trophies			0
the @entity42 would mark a good step forward for us			1
’ coming towards the final part of a season that saw @entity2 start badly , improve markedly and then disappoint once again , the problems facing their manager are familiar			1
@entity75 and @entity76 scored 55 club goals between them last season but this time round the club ’s top scorers are @entity83 and @entity33 with 10 each			2
meanwhile at the back , familiar failings re-emerged in the 4 - 1 defeat at @entity87 on saturday as @entity2 defended poorly and were left asking questions — for the first time in a while — of their goalkeeper @entity91			1
@entity2 ace @entity92 is expected to start in the absence of the suspended @entity94 and @entity95 summer signing @entity97 may also be given the chance to impress at @entity16 @entity39 vs @entity2 predicted line - ups asked if a defensive repeat would see @entity2 lose to a championship side , @entity0 said : ‘ i think so , yes			1
we did n’t defend at @entity87			0
we did n’t defend the ball well enough , we gave the ball away in poor areas for two of the four goals			0
‘ over the last few months we defended really well , we had six clean sheets against good opponents and defended very well away from home			0
‘ the minute you come off it and if you come off it against good players you can get punished and that is what happened			0
’ worryingly for @entity0 , his best two defenders — @entity94 and @entity117 — are suspended along with captain @entity33			0
there remains a genuine desire to reach may ’s @entity21 final in order to let @entity33 leave the club in memorable fashion , something that was outlined by midfielder @entity125 last week			2
‘ there is no getting away from that , ’ said @entity125			0
‘ that is something that drives us			0
we all feel we owe @entity33 a lot			0
’ if it is to happen , @entity2 must overcome what should be a stiff challenge from @entity136 ’s team			1
@entity39 did more that frustrate @entity2 in the 0 - 0 draw at @entity139 exactly a month ago			1
they could have won and we can expect them to again trouble a defence that may have to feature two of @entity0 ’ weakest links , @entity92 and @entity97			0
certainly @entity2 must lift themselves if they are to prosper			1
the fact that they have already overcome a similar challenge in round four — winning a replay at @entity149 — will perhaps encourage them but that was a @entity2 team trending upwards in form			1
currently , there is a sense that the opposite is happening			0
@entity2 will be hoping to replicate their 2001 @entity42 triumph by beating @entity87 in the final the obvious beneficiary of all this is the grand old competition itself			1
with @entity87 , @entity161 and @entity162 already in the last four , the @entity42 is guaranteed to find itself with semi-finalists who desperately want to lift the trophy			1
deep down , the @entity42 will long for an @entity87 - @entity2 final			1
that will evoke some classic memories involving the likes of @entity170 and @entity171			0
@entity0 would surely give much for the opportunity to avenge last weekend ’s league defeat on such a grand stage			0
‘ there is everything still to play for and we can still make it a really successful season , ’ he said			2
whether those words were spoken in hope or expectation , only he will really know .			0

@entity2 take on @entity39 in @entity42 semi-final replay
@entity42 success appears to be final chance of glory this season
