by @entity0 published : 17:55 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 18:20 est , 18 april 2013 warning : lord @entity1 says @entity2 will oust the @entity3 if they fail to engage with ethnic minorities in @entity5 @entity8 must do more to woo non-white voters or he has no chance of winning the next election , a former @entity7 donor has warned			1
in a hard - hitting critique , lord @entity1 pointed out that the @entity3 won just 16 per cent of the non-white vote at the last general election in 2010			1
lord @entity1 , a former deputy chairman of the party , said : ‘ only 16 per cent of ethnic minority voters supported us at the last election			1
‘ we must do better than this – both because we should be a party for the whole country , and because we will find it increasingly difficult to win a majority without them			0
‘ there is no doubt that in 2010 this situation cost us seats			0
’ lord @entity1 released details of a poll showing that ethnic minority voters share the @entity7 creed that ‘ if you work hard , it is possible to be very successful in @entity5 ’			2
but when asked which party shares their values , they opt for @entity2 by a margin of more than two to one			0
the survey also shows that 51 per cent of ethnic minority voters have never heard of @entity40 , the former @entity7 cabinet minister whose 1968 speech implying that immigration to the @entity5 would lead to ‘ rivers of blood ’ is believed by many @entity3 to have alienated ethnic minority voters from the party			1
asked whether they agree hard work can bring success , one of mr @entity8 ’s core messages , 69 per cent of @entity52 agree , along with 59 per cent of black voters and 66 per cent of black @entity54			2
only voters of black @entity57 origin are tied 50 - 50			0
hindus , @entity59 and @entity60 are more likely than the population as a whole to agree with that statement			0
but asked which party shares their values , @entity65 voters opt for @entity2 over the @entity3 by a margin of 62 to 30 per cent and black voters by a margin of 65 per cent to 16			1
just 29 per cent of @entity52 and 22 per cent of black voters think the @entity7 understand minorities			1
the poll is not all bad news for mr @entity8 , however			0
@entity5 prime minister @entity8 's visit to @entity75 was seen as an attempt to reach out the @entity5 's @entity75 community a clear majority of both black and @entity65 voters believe mr @entity8 and @entity81 ’s economic prognosis that borrowing more money now – as @entity2 wants – ‘ will simply make matters worse ’			2
the prime minister led a @entity85 meeting earlier this year at which ministers were urged to reach out to non-white voters in their constituencies			1
mr @entity8 and his strategists are keen to target @entity65 voters on the grounds that they share @entity7 values of thrift and hard work			0
his visit to @entity75 in february , during which he visited @entity97 , the holiest site for @entity59 and the scene of the worst massacre in the history of the @entity5 empire was designed to show he is taking the non-white community seriously .			0

party must reach out to non-white voters or risk being ousted
just 16 per cent supported @entity7 in 2010 election
