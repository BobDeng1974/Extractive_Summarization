a campaign by @entity0 @entity8 staff in the @entity9 this week is a play on the @entity3 poem , and includes travel advice to help keep @entity0 out of trouble			1
the rhyme - meant for visitors to the @entity18 , an oil - rich seven - state federation of former @entity0 protectorates - highlights potential cultural pitfalls through the eyes of fictional traveller @entity21			1
another says : ‘ so time to go home after several spirits neat ; but it 's a crime for @entity21 to be drunk on the street			2
’ the @entity18 ' biggest and most cosmopolitan city , @entity1 , has the most relaxed social codes in the conservative @entity44 region			1
but foreigners occasionally run afoul of strict decency laws and prohibitions on public intoxication			1
smoking : the @entity8 's campaign is meant for visitors to the @entity9 , an oil - rich seven - state federation @entity1 help : foreigners occasionally run afoul of strict decency laws and prohibitions on public intoxication @entity0 citizens have received jail sentences here after being found guilty of kissing in public and having drunken sex on the beach			1

the poem is being meted out little by little on @entity66 and @entity67 accounts operated by @entity0 's diplomatic missions to the country			2
seasonal : a large christmas tree with fake snow around it is showcased on a street in @entity1 last december ho ho ho : @entity75 waits for guests to join him for a photograph at a @entity3 party in @entity1 last year it follows a similar awareness campaign last year centred on the @entity81 that included the tweet : ‘ on the 5th day of @entity3 my friend said to me ; if i have overdone it , please send me home			1
’ millions of foreign tourists each year are drawn to the @entity18 by beaches with nearly year - round sunshine and attractions such as the @entity88 , the world 's tallest building			0
more than 100,000 @entity0 citizens live in the @entity18 , and about a million visit the country each year , according to the embassies in @entity93 and @entity1			1
twas the night before flying , at @entity21 ’s house , off to the @entity18 , along with his spouse			0
the cases were full , but packed with ill care , banned medication inside - a customs nightmare ! he forgot to check @entity103 travel advice , for that he might pay an almighty price			0
@entity105 : with visa in passport and job contract signed , a place of safe hiding , @entity21 looked to find			0
he placed carefully his passport in a safe place and carried around a copy that he brought in his case @entity105 : to the work @entity115 , off @entity21 went , for an evening of dancing and merriment			0
no holding of hands , or @entity3 kisses , under the mistletoe , despite amorous wishes			2
so time to go home after several spirits neat , but it ’s a crime for @entity21 to be drunk on the street @entity21 's adventure continues : he called for a taxi to get a ride back			0
the driver was sullen , with no @entity3 crack			2
but @entity21 was polite and kept his calm , and this gave the driver no cause for alarm			0
so @entity21 makes it home to his new bed			0
no prison this time , just a sore head !			0
