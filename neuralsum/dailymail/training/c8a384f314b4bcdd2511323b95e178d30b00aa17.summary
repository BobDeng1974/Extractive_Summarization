by @entity1 reporter published : 18:57 est , 13 january 2013 updated : 02:47 est , 14 january 2013 ministers are trying to measure loneliness amid concerns it is having devastating consequences on the nation ’s health			1
the @entity9 is drawing up a map which will pinpoint which areas of the country have the highest levels of isolation			1
it is a particular problem among the elderly and research has found that as many as half of the over 75s regard the television as their main source of company			0
figures show that 1 in 10 elderly people only see friends and family once a month , with the same proportion saying they feel cut - off from society but there is growing evidence that loneliness can cause health problems and lead to higher rates of dementia , heart disease and high blood pressure			1
it also leads to people going to their hospital or gp more frequently - just for the company - and they are more likely to move into a care home earlier			0
for the first time , officials will ask local councils and @entity50 health trusts to carry out surveys of the levels of loneliness within their communities			1
if they are found to be high , authorities will be urged to provide extra support such as befriending services and transport to day centres			0
research has found that as many as half of the over 75s regard the television as their main source of company @entity65 , the care and support minister said : ‘ for the first time we will be aiming to define the extent of the problem by introducing a national measure for loneliness			1
‘ we will be encouraging local authorities , @entity50 organisations and others to get better at measuring the condition in their communities			0
‘ once they have this information , they can come up with the right solutions to address loneliness and isolation			2
’ the charity @entity83 estimates that as many as 1 in 10 pensioners are lonely most of the time , which equates to 90,000 people			1
another 1 in 10 only see friends and family once a month , with the same proportion saying they feel cut - off from society			2
@entity92 , director of the campaign to end @entity93 - which was set up by charities last year said : ‘ loneliness is a major health issue			2
‘ an effective measure of isolation and loneliness is an important step to improving the lives of the hundreds of thousands of older people who are chronically lonely			1
‘ this national measure can only help those making local health and care decisions to prioritise loneliness as a health issue , and one that they will tackle			2
’ the campaign says being lonely is linked to high blood pressure and depression and has been shown to increase the risk of dementia by 50 per cent			0
dr @entity114 , a gp in @entity116 , said she trimmed £ 80,000 from the @entity50 ’s budget by setting up a befriending scheme for elderly patients who frequently came to the surgery			0
the patients did not have any obvious symptoms and doctors suspected that they were lonely and felt unable to cope with life			0
as part of the scheme , volunteers visit the patients and help out with jobs around the home as well as offering advice and support .			0
