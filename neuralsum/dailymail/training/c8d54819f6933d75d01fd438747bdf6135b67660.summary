by @entity0 we often think of emoticons arriving with the invention of text speak - when people first started to send messages using mobile phones and in emails			1
but the first emoticon – specifically the smiley face – could have been used much earlier			1
literary critic @entity11 came across a poem written in 1648 which includes what could be the first possible use of the smiley face emoticon , or ' : ) '			1
emoticon or typo ? literary critic @entity11 came across a poem written by @entity19 civil ar poet @entity18 in 1648 which includes what could be the first possible use of ' : ) '			1
the possible emoticon appears in the second line of his poem , ' to @entity25 ' ( pictured ) the questionable emoticon appears in the second line of @entity19 civil war poet @entity18 's verse , entitled ‘ to @entity25 ’			1
the first couple of lines read : ‘ tumble me down , and i will situpon my ruins , ( smiling yet : ) ’ he wanted to know whether the mark was a typo in his poetry book ' @entity37 ' so he checked it against a two - volume version of @entity18 ’s poetry published by @entity40 last year			1
he found that the ‘ emoticon ’ is included			2
the literary critic explained @entity18 's poetry is rich in wit , so it 's possible that the smiley face was used deliberately			1
an illustration of the poet 's bust is pictured mr @entity11 wrote on his blog : ‘ @entity18 's poetry is rich in wit , so it 's not entirely out of the bounds of possibility that this is something more than a punctuational oddity			1
’ if the mark is deliberately made to show a smile , it would predate another ‘ emoticon ’ by some two hundred years			1
that emotional piece of punctuation was found in a @entity63 transcript of one of @entity66 ’s speeches in 2009 , according to the newspaper ’s @entity68 blog			2
it reads : fellow citizens : i believe there is no precedent for my appearing before you on this occasion , [ applause ] but it is also true that there is no precedent for your being here yourselves , ( applause and laughter ; ) and i offer , in justification of myself and of you , that , upon examination , i have found nothing in the @entity89 against			0
] however , writing in the @entity92 , which describes itself as a ' journal of technology and society ' , @entity91 says : ' i hate to be a party pooper — no , really : i hate it — but i just do n't think @entity11 has found an emoticon in a seventeenth - century poem — nor , for that matter , that @entity101			2
@entity102 found one from 1862			2
’ if the mark in the poem was deliberately made to show a smile ( pictured ) , it would predate another ' emoticon ' by some two hundred years , which was found in a @entity63 transcript of one of @entity66 's speeches in 2009 emoticons such as smiley and sad faces are changing the way our brain works , @entity113 researchers have claimed			1
they say the use of the punctuation faces trigger parts of the brain usually reserved for looking at real faces			0
they believe this may be the key to their popularity - as we process them as a real face			2
' emoticons are a new form of language that we 're producing , ' dr @entity132 of the school of psychology at @entity136 in @entity137 told @entity141			2
' and to decode that language we 've produced a new pattern of brain activity			0
' the researchers say that we pay more attention to faces than most other things we see as we try to ' read ' them for emotion			0
the team wanted to see if this was the case with emoticons			2
they showed 20 participants images of real faces , smiley face emoticons and a meaningless string of characters			1
they used electrophysiology to determine the pattern of electrical activity in the brain when the participants viewed the different images , and found we react to emoticons ion the same way			0
' there is no innate neural response to emoticons that babies are born with			0
before 1982 there would be no reason that ' :-) ' would activate face sensitive areas of the cortex but now it does because we 've learnt that this represents a face , " said dr @entity173			0
' this is an entirely culturally - created neural response			0
it 's really quite amazing			0
' he said : ‘ if we were really serious about finding out whether @entity18 had used an emoticon , we ’d look for his manuscripts - since we could never be sure that his printers had carried out his wishes accurately , especially in those days of highly variable printing practices			1
’ he looked up a 19th century version of the work and found that there was no ‘ emoticon ’			0
but as the original manuscripts are not available , the mark may remain a mystery			0
however , despite literary spots , @entity200 , of @entity201 , @entity202 , wrote in a blog post : ' yes , i am the inventor of the sideways ' smiley face ' ( sometimes called an emoticon ) that is commonly used in e-mail , chat , and newsgroup posts			1
or at least i ’m one of the inventors			0
' according to the professor , they came to be used in the early 1980s among the computer science department 's online bulletin boards where a mixture of serious and jokey messages were posted			1
' in at least one case , a humorous remark was interpreted by someone as a serious safety warning , ' he writes			0
' some people suggested marking posts to show that they were not serious			1
various ' joke markers ' were suggested and in the midst of that discussion it occurred to me that the character sequence :-) would be an elegant solution , ' he said			0
' in the same post , i also suggested the use of :-( to indicate that a message was meant to be taken seriously , though that symbol quickly evolved into a marker for displeasure , frustration , or anger			0
' professor @entity200 said that the convention caught on quickly around the university and soon spread to other institutions and research labs via primitive computer networks .			0

smiley face was discovered in a poem written by @entity18 in 1648
but some people think it may be a typo
the first emoticon believed to be in a speech by @entity66 in 1862
but if this mark is deliberate , it *pre-dates* it by two hundred years
*modern* emoticons were created in the early 1980s as a way to show emotions in message board posts
