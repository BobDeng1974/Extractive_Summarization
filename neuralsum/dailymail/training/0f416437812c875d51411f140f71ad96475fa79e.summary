by @entity0 published : 06:14 est , 15 september 2013 updated : 05:21 est , 18 september 2013 @entity1 might have made headlines with their red carpet frocks on day one but day two of @entity4 proved to be one of the best yet , with @entity5 , @entity7 @entity6 and @entity8 among the highlights			1
@entity8 , although still in love with architectural sihouettes , toned down his fiercely futuristic aesthetic , adding pale blush pink and bold blue to his palette and combining oriental influences with @entity17 stripes			1
the result was tough chic with an infusion of elegance - a combination particularly noticeable in his dresses , which he continues to do brilliantly well			1
others appeared in white , blush and black , all high necked and demure although there were a number of sheer efforts that gently subverted @entity47 's ladylike look			1
like his daughter @entity59 , @entity47 has an instinct for making women look beautiful and the1950s glamazons that stalked his catwalk in puffed @entity65 skirts and elegant picture hats most certainly did			1
yet more striking gowns were to be seen at @entity68 who sent models down the runway in knitted @entity72 style gowns and long flowing skirts			2
but it was n't all good news			2
fast it seems has no intention of letting last summer 's crop top trend go quietly and sent several versions down the catwalk - all of which ended well above the belly button - and like the rest of the collection , came in a choice of acid yellow or grey			1
elegant : @entity47 's ladylike vision for next summer included the liberal use of blowsy cabbage rose print and some coolly pretty gowns in white organza @entity96 : black lace and chiffon gowns were accessorised with retro picture hats stunning : a delicate white chiffon dress was lifted with artful embroidery at @entity47 spectacular : a stunning embroidered 1950s style gown from @entity47 yellow fever : @entity105 and acid yellow dominated at knitwear specialist @entity68 who also appeared to be on a one man mission to keep last summer 's crop top trend alive although @entity109 restricted himself to a minimal palette , @entity112 , as is his wont , did not			1
there were sequins , stripes and plenty of slogans as well as some unusual regal headwear which clashed merrily with the sporty feel of the rest of the collection and the bizarre supermarket bags carried by models			1
trousers were baggy and ripped , while the sequinned and sloganed vests betrayed a hint of @entity130 style ghetto fabulous			2
best of all though , were the dresses which were short and sweet and bound to be everywhere come next summer			0
another to focus on dresses for summer was @entity134 who showed one of his best collections to date in front of a crowd that included @entity141 singer @entity140 and @entity142			1
gone were the pop art prints of seasons past and in their place delicate , accomplished florals including one especially lovely example that combined watercolour blooms with bold thorn - meshed hearts			2
@entity134 's tailoring , not always his strong point , has become a highlight with neatly cropped trousers and perfectly cut shirts in bright blue check among the best in show			1
carrier bag chic ? @entity112 accessorised his collection with bizarre designer shopping bags but produced some incredibly pretty pieces , including this dress ( above ) accomplished : @entity134 showed off his mastery of print with this stunning dress highlight : @entity134 's excellent tailoring has become one of his strengths bright spark : as is his wont , @entity134 's collection included a rainbow of eye - catching hues pretty : @entity177 designer @entity176 unveiled a typically feminine collection replete with puffed skirts and demure details , although her trademark prints were largely absent elsewhere , @entity176 showed a typically sweet collection of neat separates and demure dresses , lifted with girlishly large pockets , although without the colourful prints that made her name			1
another to impress was newcomer @entity188 who showed a well thought out collection of cleverly cut dresses in delicate silver silk and striking baroque black			2
equally impressive was fellow fresh face @entity193 whose collection had a jungle feel thanks to liberal use of zebra print and some well - executed tribal totem print			1
new generation : @entity188 showed off clever cutting skills with this stunning silver silk gown while @entity205 revealed a keen eye for print ( above ) the @entity208 : @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity140 and @entity212 all appeared to enjoy the @entity134 show glamorous gathering : @entity214 joined actress @entity215 , singer @entity216 and fellow warbler @entity209 front row at @entity5 @entity4 has long been a must - do on the celebrity circuit and this season 's shows have proved no exception			1
among the most popular was @entity134 , where designer @entity134 took a bow in front of a crowd that included @entity141 singer @entity140 , @entity142 , @entity227 and @entity228			1
but true to form , the @entity141 star could n't resist a chuckle as he sat in the front row alongside his friend , @entity233 dj , @entity212			1
earlier in the day , singer @entity209 joined model @entity214 and actress @entity215 for @entity5 's ultra-glamorous show			0
the trio sat together as gown after sparkling gown swept past , with @entity240 later declaring that she had her eye on one of the few black numbers on show			0
other celebrities to make @entity4 part of their weekend included @entity247 , the @entity248 and tv presenter @entity249			0
nails were created by @entity251 for @entity252			0
speaking about the look , she said : ‘ we wanted to use more than one nail colour this season , so we choose three			0
‘ rather than pairing the floral dresses in the show with something really obvious and feminine we went for a nude called @entity263			0
nudes are going to be big next season			0
' everyone ’s bored of bold colours now			2
we ’ve done the whole nail art craze and now things have come full circle back to neutrals			0
‘ we teamed the black dresses with an ivory colour called @entity273 and a brown shade called @entity275			0
' both are classic and perfectly complement the black looks			0
’ @entity112 's collection was inspired by the idea of a glamorous walk of shame , which was mirrored in the makeup and nails			2
@entity283 created the beauty look using @entity285			0
eyeliner ( @entity286 ) was grungy and starting to smudge and eyes were brightened with gold eyeshadow ( @entity286 ) that had dropped onto the cheeks			0
@entity290 in @entity291 ( tipped to be a big seller this season ) was pressed onto the top of the cheek bones to add sparkle and give the impression of dropped eyeshadow			0
lips were nude with just a touch of @entity299			0
nails , created by @entity302 , saw @entity285 in @entity303 out painted directly onto bare nails in a chipped shape , which was topped with @entity306 and translucent sequins - dazzling ! special thanks to @entity308 and @entity309 for driving the @entity311 team around during @entity4 .			0

@entity47 wowed the crowds with a *vintage* collection liberally splashed with cabbage rose print
@entity8 offered up a beguiling combination of bold @entity17 stripes and architectural shapes
@entity134 had the *glitziest* front row with @entity140 , @entity142 and @entity211 looking on
