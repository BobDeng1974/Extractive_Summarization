the working - class labourer who could have been a lover of the poet @entity1 while they were held at @entity3 has been revealed			1
@entity4 , a petty thief , was a fellow inmate at the jail where @entity1 had been imprisoned for homosexual acts in 1895			1
@entity1 is thought to have indicated his attraction to @entity4 who he described as a ' little dark - eyed chap ' in a letter to a friend during his two - year prison sentence			1
@entity4 , who is said to have been a potential lover of @entity1 while the pair were inmates at @entity3 a mugshot of @entity4 , which was found while researchers trawled through prison records at @entity19 now researchers from the @entity21 have uncovered never before seen pictures of inmates from the prison during the late 1890s			1
and they believe the man he was referring to was @entity4 , a dark , handsome man , who only stood at five foot two inches tall			2
academics from the university uncovered the pictures of @entity4 , while trawling the archives of @entity19			2
the mugshots of @entity4 are are thought to be the only photos in existence of any of the working - class men @entity1 took an interest in			1
poet and playwright , @entity1 , left , was sentenced to two years in @entity3 , right , for homosexual acts the researchers say that @entity4 was described as a prolific thief , who was sent to prison 21 times between 1892 and 1911			1
and so taken was @entity1 with @entity4 , it is thought that the writer sent him money and wrote to him after they were both released			1
professor @entity46 , who lead the research told @entity48 : ' it is clear to see @entity1 was interested in him and liked him and was part of a group of men he referred to as his pals			0
' i think the interest could have been a romantic one and there are certainly grounds for that			0
' but whether they were lovers it is difficult to say as @entity63 prisons practiced solitary confinement and prisoners were n't even allowed to talk to each other			0
' now pictures of @entity4 , along with those of other inmates , which forms part of a exhibition at @entity19 called ' @entity1 and @entity3 ' , which open next week			1
the research also uncovered a vast range of mugshots of prisoners taken during @entity1 's time in jail			2
however , no mugshot was ever taken of the writer the never - before - seen pictures of @entity4 were uncovered by a team from @entity21			2
lead researcher @entity46 , pictured , and his team found them while looking through archives at @entity19 @entity1 began his famous two years in @entity3 for ' gross indecency ' with the son of a lord			0
his imprisonment scandalised society in 1895 where he was also made to do hard - labour			0
the jail time lead to one of @entity1 's greatest works written about his time behind bars - ' @entity99 of @entity3 '			1
professor @entity46 added : ' the well - known legend of @entity3 has , until now , focused almost exclusively on the tragedy of @entity1			2
' but @entity1 himself urged us to look beyond this story to ‘ the others ’ , the men , women and children who were in prison alongside him			0
the modern day @entity3 , which was eventually closed down for good earlier this year in january ' it was seeing and understanding their suffering that helped him to come to terms with his own , and it made him an extraordinarily powerful advocate for prison reform			0
yet until now , no genuine effort has been made to understand the circumstances of these men			0
' it reminds us of the most attractive aspects of @entity1 ’s own character – his generosity of spirit , and his openness to the most despised members of his society			0
' @entity1 , a prolific poet and playwright renowned for his wit , was married and had two children at the time of his conviction .			0
