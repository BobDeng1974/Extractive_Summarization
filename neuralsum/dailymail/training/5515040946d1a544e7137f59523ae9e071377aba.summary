after working flat out for a long period , i was desperate for a holiday			2
when a friend suggested going to @entity4 , i jumped at the chance			1
i had stopped off there for two days a year ago on my way back to @entity8 from a tour of @entity10 and @entity11 and fell in love with the place			1
this time i could look forward to 12 days of sun , sea and exercise			1
staying fit is really important to me – it helps me cope with stress and also with my weight			0
as a chef and owner of restaurants such as @entity25 , i obviously spend the greater part of my life with food , mostly tasting it , so extra pounds can easily creep on			1
our first stop was @entity31 , a wellness retreat hidden away in the hills outside the town of @entity35			1
the setting is incredibly beautiful – parts of it are like something out of @entity40 , with huge mossy banks underneath soaring trees where you relax , sleep or read			0
@entity45 rediscovers meditation in the tranquil setting of @entity48 in @entity35 , @entity4 @entity49 looks out onto the dramatic rainforest relaxation haven of @entity51 for the first time in my life , i tried a juice detox			1
after the initial shock , i never felt hungry			0
i had vegetable juice five times a day and vegetable broth in the evening – and lost 8lb in four days			1
the juices were all freshly made and so imaginative			0
the various concoctions were sharp , with just a hint of sweetness			0
i did my exercises in the gym every day , had some great massages and also started meditating once again			1
i had tried meditation before a couple of times , but was n’t quite sure how to find time in the day for it or whether i really had the patience needed			1
but this was more mindful meditation , which you can do wherever you are			1
i liked practising it down the hillside near the water where i could hear the river and the birds singing			0
it was about being in the moment and i really loved it			0
after four days there , we moved on to the @entity85 , an amazing clifftop resort on @entity4 ’s south coast			1
the @entity89 has a really good gym which i used every day , and i did yoga every morning as well as enjoying the occasional massage			2
after my juice detox at @entity95 , now it was time to tuck into some @entity4 specialities , such as a delicious roast suckling pig			1
the views @entity89 are spectacular - this is a three - bedroom cliffside villa at the clifftop resort the surface of the water runs into the sky in this at @entity105 at the southern tip of @entity107 balinese food is spicy but delicate , and i loved the combination of fragrance and heat you get in the dishes , especially in sambals and salads , where chefs combined ingredients including lemongrass , chilli and mango			2
by now i was seriously into relaxation mode as we had our own villa with a pool … and a butler called @entity125			0
most of the time @entity125 was marvellously inconspicuous , but i only had to think i ’d like a beer or a juice , and suddenly there he was			2
we also found time for sightseeing			0
one thing that should n’t be missed is @entity132 , a temple built in the @entity134 to keep evil spirits away from @entity4			1
the 11th century - built @entity136 , created to warn off evil spirits , is a must - see we then moved up the coast to another villa , this time on the beach at @entity141			2
we arrived in the evening – by the way , in @entity4 it always seems to take two hours to reach your destination – and staff presented us with garlands which they then hung around our necks			1
the garlands were made from tuberose – and i have never smelled anything so beautiful			0
these plants grow everywhere in @entity4			1
as i ’m like a baby in that i have to taste everything , i immediately bit into the petals to see what they were like			0
there was absolutely no bitterness at all , so i ’m determined to use them in a dish soon			0
to maintain my fitness regime , i ran on the black volcanic sand at @entity141			0
in a certain light it looked as if diamonds were sparkling in it			0
an ocean pool villa at @entity169 , which is surrounded by @entity171 rice fields the black volcanic sands near @entity141 looks as if diamonds are sparkling in in , in a certain light one day i headed to the beach for a different mission – to cook some chicken			2
the hotel chef joined me and first we made a fire pit with coconut tiles ( these are used in the local village for roofs and can get very hot but retain the heat ) , then cooked the chicken which had been marinated and wrapped in banana leaves			2
when it was ready , we ate it on the beach			0
it was one of the most memorable things i tasted there			0
best of all , another of the chefs gave me his grandmother ’s recipe for a sambal which i will use in @entity8			1
this was one of the best and most relaxing holidays i ’ve ever had			0
would i go back ? in a flash			2

@entity45 *'s* love for @entity4 was ignited on a short two - day stop there on the way back to the @entity8 from a tour of @entity10 and @entity11
