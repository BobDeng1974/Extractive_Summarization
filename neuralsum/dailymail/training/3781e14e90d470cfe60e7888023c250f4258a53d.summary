the forth run of the drama - sold to over 220 territories around the world and believed to have been seen by approximately 120 million people - will begin next month			2
and the millions seduced by the strait - laced but stylish world of the @entity14 historical drama will soon be able to take some of that style home			2

there will be a board game , homewares , clothes , beauty products , and even @entity1 wine hitting stores this year the programme 's makers have arguably been slow to exploit the commercial potential of the show 's popularity through merchandising , selling little more than dvd sets , wall calendars and desk diaries			1
but that is all about to change			2
a huge range of merchandise is being rolled out to accompany the fourth season , including a board game , homewares , clothes , beauty products , and even @entity1 wine - all in the best possible taste , naturally			1
' we have n't rushed into it , ' executive producer @entity58 told @entity61 this week			0
' we do n't want to carpet bomb the retail sector			0
' on october 12 , @entity14 retail chain @entity64 will launch its @entity1 beauty line in 250 stores and online			1
the range includes soap , nail polish , lip gloss , lotion and scented candles			1
the items are whimsically packaged and inscribed with quotations from the series , including the advice offered by @entity79 's @entity78 of @entity22 in the first episode : ' no one wants to kiss a girl in black			0
' want lips as soft as @entity19 's ? @entity64 are unveiling a @entity1 make - up range which includes lip gloss and balm @entity1 merchandising in the @entity89 and @entity90 is handled by @entity91 , which has struck deals for a jewellery range from @entity94 and @entity1 - themed @entity96 ornaments from @entity97 - both going on sale later this year			1
it also has a licensing agreement with figurine manufacturer @entity101 , raising fans ' hopes for a range of @entity1 dolls - scheming @entity106 , perhaps			1
@entity109 fans also can soon drink @entity1 wine , marketed by @entity111 , the @entity113 company behind @entity114 and @entity116 's @entity115			0
the @entity1 red is a @entity119 claret reminiscent of those favored by the early 20th - century @entity14 aristocracy			0
@entity122 , a professor of marketing at the @entity124 at @entity124 , says the richly detailed world of @entity1 is key to viewers ' intense bond with the show she likens it to @entity130 saying : ' it 's not just a television program , it 's really an aesthetic ' - and cites reported rises in sales of cravats , waistcoats and sherry as evidence of a @entity1 - driven appetite for @entity141 elegance			0
' it 's that whole thing about presenting a lifestyle , ' she said			0
' we get in the house , we get inside these characters ' lives			1
we see inside their bedrooms , their bathrooms , their kitchens			0
we can absorb ourselves not only in the story , which is compelling , but in the details of their lives			0
' no detail is too small to be cashed in on - down to the paint on the abbey walls			1
@entity159 , the @entity160 - based paint company that supplies the show with historically accurate pigments , recently began marketing two of its @entity1 tones to the public - @entity164 , the color of the downstairs kitchen overseen by cook mrs. @entity27 , and @entity167 , which adorns mr. @entity170 's butler 's pantry			1
these are not just any greys			0
' on the sets they look quite dark because they use them below stairs , ' said @entity159 spokeswoman @entity179			0
but in real life , ' they do look extremely chic			0
' @entity122 hopes the products manage to remain tasteful rather than tacky			1
as a fan , she urges producers to ' take a page from @entity22 and @entity187 's pool of reserve " and limit the range of merchandise , ' i hope they do n't over-market the show , ' she said			1
@entity64 is launching a @entity1 beauty line , including soap , nail polish , lip gloss , lotion and scented candles , on october 12			1
the @entity200 ( £ 8.50 ) and the three - shade @entity202 collection ( £ 9.50 ) the items are whimsically packaged and adorned with quotations from the series - @entity207 ( £ 5 ) @entity58 - who heads @entity1 production company @entity209 , owned by @entity210 - is n't worried			0
' i do n't have a nervous attitude about the idea of merchandising , ' said @entity58 , who personally approves every item of merchandise			2
' when a show is this global and this loved , i do n't see any problem with offering products to hardened fans who want to extend their relationship with the show that they love			2
we are running a business , which is to create intellectual property and to monetise it			0
' we sell as many dvds as we can , and we sell the show in as many countries as we can , and you know what , by doing that we get the money on the screen and it allows me to finance other shows that we want to make and employ people			0
so i 'm not coy about the merchandising and its purpose			1
' the hit @entity241 series has inspired a @entity119 claret that producers say the cast would be proud of			2
