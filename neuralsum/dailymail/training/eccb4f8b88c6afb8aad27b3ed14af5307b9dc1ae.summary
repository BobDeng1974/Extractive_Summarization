by @entity1 reporter published : 21:00 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 05:57 est , 12 january 2013 a @entity4 , @entity3 , mother is fearing for her family 's safety after the tap water in their home caught alight , causing a ' huge explosion			1
' @entity11 was lighting a candle near the sink a few weeks ago when the water suddenly ignited , creating a fireball in the bathroom			1
' oh i was so scared			0
it just was a huge explosion , the entire sink up to the ceiling , ' @entity18 told the today show			1
' we 're putting our kids in the bathtub every night in this explodable water , ' @entity18 said			2
methane is invisible and occurs naturally in the ground but can become dangerous when it seeps into water wells			0
when the ground is shaken up by anything from earthquakes to drilling the seepage gets even worse			0
according to today , a natural gas company has been drilling at a site close by to the @entity18 's home			1
before embarking on the drilling , the company , @entity51 , paid the family to test their water			2
the results showed the methane levels were 9 , which is just within safe limits			0
however , just months into the project , the methane levels had shot up to 22 â€” more than twice the acceptable level			2
explosion : the explosion occurred because the @entity31 's water , which comes from a local well , contains more than twice the safe level of highly - flammable methane gas gas : methane is invisible , and naturally occurring in the ground but can become dangerous when it seeps into water wells ' we 're wondering if this is all just coincidental , ' @entity18 told the @entity73 morning show			1
@entity74 of the @entity75 told today that millions of families across the @entity77 shared the @entity18 's fear of their water exploding every time they turned the faucet			1
' this family in @entity3 is not alone , ' she said			2
' there 's been methane found in drinking water across the country			2
' @entity74 said laws need to be tougher to protect homeowners			0
' @entity91 companies have been granted special exemptions from of our most important environmental laws , ' she said			0
' and we need really tough enforcement , which we do n't have now			0
' fears : the @entity18 family , pictured , are drinking bottled water but continue to bathe using the tap drilling : a natural gas company has been drilling at a site , pictured , close by to the @entity18 's home , which may have caused the level of methane to increase @entity3 officials told today that they were investigating the case and @entity108 has asked the @entity109 to study the potential effects of drilling on drinking water			1
@entity113 said that they support the state investigation , adding that ' there are many natural variables that can cause the levels of methane to change			0
' the @entity118 could buy a methane filtering system to protect themselves against the highly - flammable water but , at $ 8,000 , they ca n't afford it			1
instead , they are drinking bottled water and are continuing to bathe using the tap			0
' we do n't know the consequences of sitting in gas water , ' said @entity11 , tearing up			1
' we just do n't have a choice			0

@entity11 was lighting a candle near the sink a few weeks ago when the water suddenly exploded
occurred because the @entity18 family 's well water contains double the acceptable amount of highly - flammable methane gas
drilling for natural gas at a site near to the @entity4 , @entity3 , home could have caused the methane level to rise
officials in @entity3 and in @entity144 are investigating the case
