the number of homeless children in the @entity2 has surged in recent years to an all - time high , amounting to one child in every 30 , according to a comprehensive state - by - state report that blames the nation 's high poverty rate , the lack of affordable housing and the impacts of pervasive domestic violence			1
titled @entity2 's @entity14 , the report being issued monday by the @entity12 on @entity13 calculates that nearly 2.5 million @entity2 children were homeless at some point in 2013			1
the number is based on the @entity19 's latest count of 1.3 million homeless children in public schools , supplemented by estimates of homeless pre-school children not counted by the @entity24			1
in good care : in this june 2014 photo provided by @entity27 , a homeless shelter in @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , aged four , gets to work with some paints the problem is particularly severe in @entity30 , which has one - eighth of the @entity2 population but accounts for more than one - fifth of the homeless children with a tally of nearly 527,000			1
@entity37 , director of the national center and a co-author of the report , noted that the federal government has made progress in reducing homelessness among veterans and chronically homeless adults			1
' the same level of attention and resources has not been targeted to help families and children , ' she said			2
' as a society , we 're going to pay a high price , in human and economic terms			2
' child homelessness increased by eight percent nationally from 2012 to 2013 , according to the report , which warned of potentially devastating effects on children 's educational , emotional and social development , as well as on their parents ' health , employment prospects and parenting abilities			1
the report included a composite index ranking the states on the extent of child homelessness , efforts to combat it , and the overall level of child well - being			1
states with the best scores were @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			1
at the bottom were @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity30			1
@entity30 's poor ranking did not surprise @entity82 , director of the @entity83			1
the crux of the problem , she said , is the state 's high cost of living , coupled with insufficient affordable housing			1
' people think , " of course we are not letting children and families be homeless , " so there 's a lot of disbelief , ' @entity82 said			1
' @entity30 has not invested in this issue			2
' @entity82 , 29 , was homeless on and off throughout adolescence , starting when her parents were evicted when she was in 7th grade			2
at 15 , she and her older brother took off and survived by sleeping in the tool sheds , backyards and basements of acquaintances			0
' these terms like " couch surfing " and " doubled - up " sound a lot more polite than they are in practice , ' she said			0
' for teenagers , it might be exchanging sex for a place to stay or staying someplace that does not feel safe because they are so mired in their day - to - day survival needs			0
' growing problem : volunteer @entity117 , center right , helps out at @entity27 in @entity30 - @entity30 accounts for more than one - fifth of the homeless children with a tally of nearly 527,000 near @entity121 , @entity122 and her son , then 12 , had to vacate their home in 2012 when her wages of under $ 10 an hour became insufficient to pay the rent			1
after a few months as nomads , they found shelter and support with @entity132 , an interfaith program in @entity134 , @entity30 , and stayed there five months before @entity136 , 44 , saved enough to be able to afford housing on her own			1
' it was a painful time for my son , ' @entity136 said			0
" on the way to school , he would be crying , " i hate this			0
" ' in mostly affluent @entity29 , the @entity27 homeless shelter is kept busy with families unable to afford housing of their own			2
executive director @entity148 said that even after her staff gives clients money for security deposits and rent , they go months without finding a place to live			0
' landlords are n't desperate , ' she said			0
' they wo n't put a family of four in a two - bedroom place because they can find a single professional who will take it			0
' she said neither federal nor state housing assistance nor incentives for developers to create low - income housing have kept pace with demand			2
' we need more affordable housing or we need to pay people $ 25 an hour , ' she said			1
' the minimum wage is n't cutting it			0
' among the current residents at @entity27 are @entity176 , @entity177 and their two - year - old son , @entity178 @entity176 , 28 , said he lost his job and turned to @entity27 as his unemployment insurance ran out			0
the couple has been on a list to qualify for subsidized housing since 2008 , but they are n't counting on that option and hope to save enough to rent on their own now that @entity176 is back at work as an electrician			0
@entity189 , due to have a second child in december , is grateful for the shelter 's support but said its rules had been challenging			2
with her son in tow , she was expected to vacate the premises each morning by 8am and not return before 5pm			0
' i 'd go to the park , or drive around , ' she said			0
' it was kind of hard			0
' the new report by the @entity12 on @entity13 - a part of the private , nonprofit @entity203 - says remedies for child homelessness should include an expansion of affordable housing , education and employment opportunities for homeless parents , and specialized services for the many mothers rendered homeless due to domestic violence			1
efforts to obtain more resources to combat child homelessness are complicated by debate over how to quantify it			1
@entity219 : child homelessness increased eight percent from 2012 to 2013 , according to a new report , which warns of potentially devastating effects on children 's educational , emotional and social development the @entity225 conducts an annual one - day count of homeless people that encompasses shelters , as well as parks , underpasses , vacant lots and other locales			1
its latest count , for a single night in january 2013 , tallied 610,042 homeless people , including 130,515 children			1
defenders of @entity225 's method say it 's useful in identifying the homeless people most in need of urgent assistance			2
critics contend that @entity225 's method grossly underestimates the extent of child homelessness and results in inadequate resources for local governments to combat it			1
they prefer the @entity19 method that includes homeless families who are staying in cheap motels or doubling up temporarily in the homes of friends or relatives			2
' fixing the problem starts with adopting an honest definition , ' said @entity255 , president of the nonprofit @entity256			0
' right now , these kids are sort of left out there by themselves			0
' @entity260 's group and some allies have endorsed a bill introduced in @entity263 , with bipartisan sponsorship , that would expand @entity225 's definition to correlate more closely with that used by the @entity19			0
however , the bill does n't propose any new spending for the hundreds of thousands of children who would be added to the @entity225 tally			0
@entity82 , of the @entity83 , says most of the homeless schoolchildren in her state are n't living in shelters			0
' it 's often one family living in extreme poverty going to live with another family that was already in extreme poverty , ' she said			2
' kids have slept in closets and kitchens and bathrooms and other parts of the house that have not been meant for sleeping			0
