by @entity0 published : 11:43 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 11:47 est , 29 october 2012 satellite mismanagement has left @entity3 facing a data gap that will leave weather forecasters unable to predict to the movements of major storms , it has emerged			2
as states along east coast batten down the hatches in anticipation of the arrival of @entity14 , there are claims the country will be left blind to oncoming storms as ageing weather satellites wear out			1
experts are growing increasingly alarmed , with official estimates showing that the @entity3 will be left with a gap of coverage for two years from 2016 that could ' threaten life and property '			1
satellite image of @entity14 : wear and tear of @entity3 's ageing weather satellites could mean valuable images like this are a thing of the past , leaving forecasters blind to potentially devastating weather most of the information forecasters have been able to gather about the path of @entity14 has been gathered thanks to orbiters which travel from pole to pole , gathering information as they go			1
on the basis of that data they now know that @entity14 has strengthened to nearly 1,000 miles wide with deadly winds in excess of 85mph , leading them to issue warnings to the 50million people living in its path			1
the new jersey shore is expected to take the brunt of the massive weather front - which forecasters said could be the largest in @entity3 history - as @entity14 hits near @entity56 around 2am on tuesday and churns north			1
the worst of the accelerating category 1 storm is expected to bring a ' life - threatening ' surge of seawater up to 11ft high , coastal hurricane winds and a barrage of heavy snow in the @entity64			2
the view from space : most of the forecasts about the path of @entity14 have been made thanks to data from orbiters which travel from pole to pole , gathering information as they go users of the @entity77 's voice - activated assistant @entity76 would have have got a shock if they relied on it for forecasts about the weather in @entity82 this week			1
one user who asked their phone about the storm which has led to the shut down of almost the entire @entity3 @entity87 and got the response : ' i do n't see any reports of hurricanes			2
' unfortunately for @entity94 , the @entity77 user in question is a member of staff on @entity96 , one of @entity82 's leading social news websites			0
she tried again , this time asking whether @entity76 knew of any reports of incoming thunderstorms			0
@entity76 answered again in the negative			0
' no , i do n't see any thunderstorms , ' the app told her			0
the @entity105 reported how 84 per cent of the data used for @entity14 forecasts has come from the @entity107			1
this system uses satellites which fly pole - to - pole orbits each day carrying instruments to sense atmospheric moisture , temperature and other important weather - influencing factors			1
however , the @entity105 reports how no less than three independent reviews carried out this summer into the @entity3 's $ 13billion weather satellite programme have raised serious concerns with its implementation			0
the @entity125 â€™s inspector general , the @entity121 , and a team of outside experts each questioned cost estimates , criticised managers and called for urgent remedies			0
the outside team were particularly damning in their assessment of the programme , which is run jointly by @entity132 and the @entity3 @entity133 and @entity134 ( @entity135 ) , condemning it as ' dysfunctional '			0
most worrying among their findings were that existing polar satellites were reaching the end of their lives , and in some cases had exceeded them , and delays have seen the launch of replacements has slip back to 2017 and 2022			2
@entity148 , commissioner of emergency management for @entity150 on @entity151 , directly in the path of @entity14 , told the @entity105 his team ' can not afford to lose ' any early warning systems			2
in 1938 the area he is responsible for was struck by a hurricane that resulted in hundreds of deaths , and mr @entity148 said he needed precise forecasts to know when to evacuate vulnerable people like nursing home residents			0
' without accurate forecasts it is hard to know when to pull that trigger , ' he added .			0

ageing satellites expected to wear out by 2016 , leaving an expected gap in coverage of two years
most of the information about the oncoming @entity14 has been gathered from the very system that is at risk
