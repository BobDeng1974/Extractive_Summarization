by @entity0 and @entity1 a third year of drought in @entity3 has meant farmers have become increasingly dependent on ground water for their crops - and now the land is sinking beneath their feet			1
a @entity10 study found that land sinking had been measured at nearly one - foot per year in one area in the @entity13 , and that it is reducing the flow capacity of the @entity15 and the @entity16 , two key sources of water			2
increased pumping of groundwater is damaging vital water infrastructure , the @entity10 says			2
no end : houseboats and boat docks on @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity3 on 24 july 2014			2
water levels show below the reddish banks which is 41 meters ( 135 ft ) from crest and 36 per cent of capacity as @entity3 goes through its third straight year of dry weather sinking feeling : visitors take photographs at the bottom of @entity35 , which is 17 per cent of its capacity , in @entity35 , @entity3 ' we were surprised at the amount of land being affected , ' @entity40 , a @entity10 hydrologist and the report 's lead author			1
' we were also surprised by the rapid rate of ( sinking )			0
' @entity44 , a farmer who uses groundwater to keep his crops of corn and alfalfa alive says the ground at his @entity51 farm is sinking between six and eight inches a year			1
@entity52 runs a water company nearby that sells river water to farmers who do n't have groundwater to depends on			2
now , reports @entity58 , @entity44 's underground wells are collapsing and the dam @entity52 depends on has sunk so far that the river is threatening to spill over			1
the two , along with other @entity3 farmers , are trying to brainstorm ways to curb the heavy reliance on groundwater and that resulting damage			1
farmer @entity44 stands in a dry river bed that has sunk due to subsidence and farms are n't the only ones suffering from the sinking land			0
railways , roads and pipelines - things that extend over a long distance - are also under threat from an increase in the rate of ground sinking , @entity40 said			1
for @entity3 's bullet train project , which would speed through the @entity51 , the sinking ground is being taken into account for the system 's design , @entity87 , the chief program manager for the @entity88			1
he said the rail system will be made of a flexible material that can give into movement			0
@entity93 , @entity3 : an observation deck over the lake is left high and dry as the water level in @entity93 is only a third full crisis : cattle graze before near the @entity16 on grassland that remains dry and brown at the height of the rainy season ' this is just one more box to check on our list of engineering considerations , ' @entity87 said			0
@entity107 said the issue has already affected construction projects on the massive @entity111 restoration , already projected to cost $ 1 billion			0
the issue of sinking land in the @entity114 is not new , but had slowed in recent decades after the construction of the @entity16 and @entity15			0
but the sinking problem in the two years studied 2008 - 2010 was exacerbated by drought , the report found			0
in those dry years , there was less rain , but also limits placed by water regulators on surface water use			0
this caused farmers and others to increase the amount of water pumped from underground ; there are no restrictions on groundwater pumping in @entity3 .			1

the ground is sinking up to a foot each year each year in @entity3 farming areas
the third year of drought in the state means farmers are increasingly dependent on groundwater
underground wells are collapsing and infrastructure is being damaged
railways , roads and pipelines are also under threat
