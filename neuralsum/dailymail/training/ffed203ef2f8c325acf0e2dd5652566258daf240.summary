by @entity0 @entity1 is the chief executive of @entity2 , which has announced it will cap winter bills at 3.9 per cent energy giant @entity2 has shamed its ‘ big six ’ rivals by capping its winter bills price rise at 3.9 per cent			1
the increase is bad news for its 2.6 million customers - however it is less than half of the 10 per cent imposed by its major competitors			1
independent analysts said @entity2 customers will be paying an extra £ 52 a year , taking the average annual dual fuel bill up to £ 1,384			1
the @entity20 - owned firm ’s decision to cap the increase means its new standard tariff is up to £ 107 cheaper a year than the likes of @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
the fact that it has been able to announce a lower price rise will increase suspicions that its rivals are guilty of profiteering			2
@entity2 said that just £ 1 of the latest rise can be blamed on a higher cost of wholesale gas and electricity			1
the rest relates to costs imposed by the government and regulators , most of which are associated with cutting energy use and carbon emissions in a switch to green energy			0
it said the price rise would have been £ 50 higher if it had factored in the rising cost of the government @entity50 scheme			2
this involves applying a supplement to all bills to finance free home energy efficiency measures – loft insulation , double glazing and efficient boilers – for the poor			0
@entity2 said that as the prime minister has signalled plans to shake - up this scheme , perhaps shifting the bill to general taxation , it has decided to hold off adding this to tariffs			1
its chief executive , @entity1 , said : ‘ the best way to help customers is for us to keep our prices as low as possible			2
‘ i know that price rises are always unwelcome , but we have taken the first step to show what can be done if rising costs are tackled head - on			0
’ mr @entity1 said he supported schemes to make homes more energy efficient , but insisted the cost of the schemes needed to be cut			0
‘ something can and must be done for consumers , ’ he said			0
‘ energy firms , politicians and consumer groups need to be part of the solution and stand on the side of customers to give them energy at an affordable price			2
’ while @entity2 was keen to claim credit for its lower price rise , the reality is that the company remains more expensive than a number of small independents			2
for example , @entity97 currently has a variable rate tariff charging an average of £ 1,116.41 a year , which is a saving of £ 268 versus @entity2			1
for those looking for more certainty , @entity101 has a fixed rate deal until june 2015 with a relatively low average bill of £ 1,178.48			1
@entity106 , the only one of @entity109 ’s big suppliers yet to increase prices for this winter , declined to comment on whether it was rising prices yesterday			0
it is reported to be planning a 6.6 per cent increase			0
@entity2 said that as the prime minister has signalled plans to shake - up this scheme , perhaps shifting the bill to general taxation , it has decided to hold off adding this to tariffs energy secretary , @entity121 , said he was ‘ encouraged ’ that @entity2 had kept its price rise much closer to the general rate of inflation than some of its competitors			1
he insisted the energy market is becoming more competitive and said people can make meaningful savings by shopping around			0
which ? executive director , @entity130 welcomed @entity2 ’s lower price rise , saying : ‘ today ’s announcement will make people question why other major suppliers have hit their customers so much harder			1
’ @entity136 , energy expert at @entity138 , said : ‘ any winter price rise is a blow to consumers as it makes the struggle to afford to stay warm that little bit harder			0
‘ however , @entity2 is to be applauded for the stance it is taking by factoring in the potential reduction on green levies into its calculations			1
‘ this means that customers will know upfront that they will benefit from any step the government takes to reduce the impact of ‘ hidden ’ taxes on bills			2
more importantly it also challenges the government to put its money where its mouth is and to make good its pledges on affordability			0
’ energy industry expert , @entity161 , director of @entity162 , said : ‘ this is a smaller price rise because it comes with strings attached			0
it puts pressure on the government to shift the burden of some policy costs from the bill to taxation			0

analysts said @entity2 customers will be paying an extra £ 52 a year , taking average annual dual fuel bill to £ 1,384
decision to cap the increase means its new standard tariff is up to £ 107 cheaper than the likes of @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26
