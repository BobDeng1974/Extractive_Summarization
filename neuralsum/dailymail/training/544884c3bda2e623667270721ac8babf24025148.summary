by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:27 pm on 19th january 2012 it may look like the lovechild of a garden shed and an exclusive 1920s @entity6 but this little beauty is expected to raise an incredible £ 250,000 when it goes on sale			1
do n't be fooled by the odd and rather strange looking appearance , this rare 1928 @entity10 is thought to be the world 's first estate car and therefore has a starring role in automotive history			1
the roller was transformed into a troop - carrying motor to assist in the war effort after engineers removed the roof and rear half of the bodywork			1
. practicality : this unusual pre-war @entity6 is an historic milestone in automotive development worth £ 250,000			1
it is claimed to be the world 's first estate car they then welded on the wooden section to the original chasis creating a large carriage in the back			2
all that newly created space allowed the military to ferry personnel around during @entity38			0
and as a result of the refit the vintage car was given the name ' @entity42 ' and became the forerunner to estate - loving marques like @entity46			1
this @entity47 is currently owned by a wealthy @entity49 car collector who has decided it is time to move it on to a new home			2
rare design : the 1928 @entity10 limousine was commandeered as part of the war effort and adapted to carry @entity58 ground crew around airfields during @entity60 's darkest days the car will go under the hammer at auction house @entity64 automobile sale and due to its unusual design and historical interest is expected to sell for hundreds of thousands of pounds			1
@entity67 , a specialist in vintage cars at @entity64 , said : ' @entity42 were very popular in the fifties and sixties and were the first type of estate cars			2
' if you had an old @entity6 then it probably looked a bit tired and worn out but mechanically it would have been fine			0
' rather than just scrap it , people would lop off the back half and replace it with a wooden construction			0
' the chasis , wheels , engine , bonnet and wings would have remained the same			0
' they were ideal for carrying hunting or coach parties across country estates which is why estate cars of today are called estate cars			0
' @entity92 for sale was one of the first to undergo the unusual change			0
' before the war , @entity96 were sold as a running chasis with an engine and bonnet but the body was totally separate and made by coachbuilders to the clients taste			0
' this one was used as a limousine and was owned by the @entity106 who kept it from 1928 until 1939			2
' he then either loaned it or it was commandeered by the @entity58 for the war effort and turned into the @entity47			0
the back doors would have opened up and everybody would have piled in			0
' @entity113 you believe it 's a roller ? the 1928 phantom goes on sale at @entity64 in @entity117 at the start of february who wood have thought it ? the estate even has a folding rear seat in the back , as well as these extra , but still matching , chairs after the war the car was bought by @entity127 whose family owned @entity130 in @entity131			1
