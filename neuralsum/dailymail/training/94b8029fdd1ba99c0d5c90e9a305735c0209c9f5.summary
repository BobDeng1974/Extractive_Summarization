fears are growing of a neo-fascist uprising in @entity2 as ousted president @entity3 called for referendums in every region to determine how pro-russian the country actually is			1
hundreds of members of the ultra-nationalist @entity10 movement stormed the parliament ( @entity12 ) building in @entity13 last night , smashing windows and breaking down doors			1
the riot erupted just hours before @entity18 's foreign ministry today warned that ethnic minorities in @entity2 are ' living in fear ' of the expanding power of the far - right across the divided nation			1
right sector activists are angry over the killing of their leader , @entity26 , better known as @entity26 , who died in a shoot - out with police in a cafe in @entity30 , in western @entity2 , on monday			1
' the shooting of @entity26 is a contract killing ordered by the minister			0
' meanwhile , @entity2 's deposed president @entity3 called for each of the country 's regions to hold a referendum on its status within @entity2 , instead of presidential elections planned for may 25			2
' we want a vote ' : meanwhile , @entity2 's deposed president @entity3 called for each of the country 's regions to hold a referendum on its status within @entity2 , instead of presidential elections planed for may 25 fight back : @entity10 leader @entity73 ( not pictured ) said he plans to run for president in a may 25 election , but is a rank outsider well - armed : right sector members usually wear masks , helmets and protection for their hands and feet , and carry sticks or iron bars in case of confrontation with riot police hard line : since late november , huge crowds have been camped out in central @entity13 , opposing the government 's partnership with @entity18 and calling for early elections ' as a president who is with you with all my thoughts and soul , i urge every sensible citizen of @entity2 : do n't give in to impostors ! demand a referendum on the status of each region within @entity2 , ' @entity3 , who fled to @entity18 last month , was quoted as saying in an address to the people of @entity2			1
@entity3 is currently in hiding in @entity18 , wanted for mass murder in @entity2 after allegedly ordering police to shoot more than 100 people during last month 's anti-government protests			1
he fled across the @entity18 border with a handful of bodyguards towards the end of february where he was granted safe haven by @entity18 's president @entity114			2
a senior white house official has caused outrage after she posted a ' selfie ' on @entity118 holding a sign that read : ' @entity120			0
' @entity122 spokeswoman @entity121 was accused of trivialising the crisis in @entity2 when she tweeted : ' to echo @entity124 today - proud to stand # @entity125			2
@entity126 should stand together with one voice			0
' the photograph showed her , in a yellow suit , giving a thumbs up and holding the sign			0
but her attempt at ' solving the crisis with selfies ' was widely mocked online			0
' presenting the @entity136 to counter " @entity18 aggression , " ' one blogger posted on @entity139			0
' # @entity140 ! ' another wrote : ' no wonder @entity114 covers his mouth when speaking to @entity124 , perhaps to hide his laugh ? ' and one wondered : ' how flippin ’ sad has the @entity146 become ? ' @entity121 defended the tweet , saying : ' the people of @entity2 are fighting to have their voices heard and the benefit of communicating over social media is it sends a direct message to the people that we are with them , we support their fight , their voice and their future			2
' insisting he is still the rightful leader of @entity2 , he has sporadically emerged to comment on the ongoing turmoil in @entity2			0
his comments , after @entity162 annexed @entity50 following a referendum there in favour of joining @entity18 this month , echo @entity18 's call for @entity13 's new leaders to enact nationwide constitutional reforms that may grant broader powers to the country 's regions			1
' only an all - @entity2 referendum , not a snap presidential election , can , in a significant way , stabilise the political situation and preserve sovereignty and @entity2 's ( territorial ) integrity , ' he said			0
@entity2 remains deeply divided over protests that led to @entity3 's ousting and many eastern @entity18 - speaking regions are sceptical over the policies of the new government in @entity13			1
the emergence of far - right groups such as @entity10 in @entity2 has been cited by @entity18 as justification for its move to annex @entity50 and protect the peninsula 's ethnic @entity18 majority from @entity2 ‘ fascists '			1
@entity18 said this month mr @entity26 was under investigation for fighting alongside rebels in @entity18 's @entity192 region in the 1990s			2
and as @entity13 reeled from the night 's unruly demonstrations , @entity146 resident @entity124 issued yet another shot across @entity18 's bows , demanding it take broader steps to reduce tensions in @entity2 now			1
' it 's well known and well acknowledged that you 've seen a range of troops massing along that border under the guise of military exercises , ' he told @entity206			0
' but these are not what @entity18 would normally be doing			0
and , you know , it may simply be an effort to intimidate @entity2 or it may be that they 've got additional plans			0
' and in @entity18 , the country 's foreign ministry today alleged that ethnic minorities in @entity2 are living in fear after the ouster of the country 's president and the coming to power of interim authorities that include right - wing nationalists			1
the statement by the ministry was in line with @entity18 's frequent contention that @entity2 's large ethnic @entity18 community faces repression under the new government that @entity162 characterizes as fascist			1
the ministry statement raises the stakes on the issue , saying that ethnic @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 in @entity2 also feel themselves in peril			0
' they are unsettled by the unstable political situation in the country and are seriously afraid for their lives , " the statement said , without citing specific incidents			0
@entity18 has brought large numbers of troops to areas near the @entity2 border and speculation is strong that @entity162 could use protection of ethnic @entity18 as a pretext for a military incursion			1
tensions between @entity2 's ethnic @entity18 and @entity2 - speakers continue to plague the country in the wake of the ouster of president @entity3 , who fled to @entity18 in february after months of protests against him			1
the @entity50 region , where ethnic @entity18 are a majority , voted this month to secede from @entity2 and @entity18 has formally annexed the @entity261 peninsula , a move that @entity264 countries have denounced as illegitimate			1
talk percolates of similar referenda in other regions with large @entity18 populations , although none has been scheduled			0
as reports of his public address trickled in , none specified if he envisioned referenda in each region or a national vote , nor did he say what actually should be voted on			0
proposals have been floated by @entity18 and some politicians to federalize @entity2 - giving the regions more autonomy			2
the interim authorities reject such a move			0
another warning : and as @entity13 reeled from the night 's unruly demonstrations , @entity146 resident @entity124 ( pictured boarding @entity288 in @entity289 today ) issued yet another shot across @entity18 's bows , demanding it takes steps to reduce tensions in @entity2 now golden gates : meanwhile , @entity18 's president @entity114 attends a meeting with the newly promoted top officers from various branches of the @entity18 armed forces and @entity299 at the @entity300 in @entity162 @entity3 's biggest rival , former prime minister @entity302 , attacked the statement , accusing @entity3 of being ' a tool aimed at destroying the independence of @entity2			1
' also today , @entity18 's president said @entity2 could regain some arms and equipment of military units in @entity50 that did not switch their loyalty to @entity18			1
@entity18 forces took control of @entity2 military installations in @entity50 this month after @entity18 formally annexed the @entity261 peninsula			2
some @entity2 servicemen reportedly joined @entity18 forces , while others withdrew			2
@entity18 defense minister @entity318 on friday told president @entity114 that the @entity2 withdrawal from @entity50 is complete , @entity18 news agencies reported			2
@entity114 also approved @entity318 's proposal to turn over arms and equipment of the units still loyal to @entity2 , the reports said			0
no specifics were given on quantities , types of hardware or timing .			0
