by @entity0 , business correspondent published : 17:54 est , 17 december 2012 updated : 06:01 est , 19 december 2012 the number of people surviving till the age of 105 or more has almost doubled in less than a decade , official figures revealed yesterday			1
there are 640 @entity7 who have reached that grand old age or greater , compared with 350 in 2002 , the @entity5 , reveals			1
the number of ' super centenarians ' – which experts classify as aged 110 or over – were unavailable but are also said to be rising fast			1
experts predict @entity7 's ageing population will continue on the same trend , with more and more living far longer than their own parents or grandparents			1
while the extra years will be welcome to most , many will not have put aside enough to fund a long retirement or the periods of ill - health that can accompany old age			2
more are continuing in work after their official retirement date , with many finding that the returns on their pensions are far short of what they had expected			2
the majority of the ' super- elderly ' are women , who normally live longer than men			2
many wives survive their husbands by many years , or even decades			2
of the 640 aged 105 and above in the @entity7 in 2010 – the latest year for which figures are available – 560 are women and 80 are men			1
the @entity5 also said the number of those who are aged 110 or more is rising ' year - on - year ' in @entity41 and @entity42 , although it does not have an exact number			0
many pensioners prefer to stay active in their old age and choose to go back to work overall , the figures , published yesterday , show there are 12,640 people in the @entity7 who are aged 100 or over			1
this is a record and a number that is rising sharply every year because of improved medical treatment , better nutrition and rising living standards			0
@entity55 , founder of @entity56 , said : ' the old adage about people living for " three score years and ten " is clearly over the hill			0
' @entity7 are healthier and living longer than ever before			1
but our finances are in much less rude health			0
' as we live longer , pension companies are being forced to pay out for longer , and have of course passed those costs on			0
' annuities – the income for life paid out by an insurance firm when you cash in your pension pot – have dropped dramatically , forcing many older people to keep on working			1
nearly one million pensioners are working in @entity7 , the largest number since records began , according to official figures published last week by the @entity5			1
over the last year , the army of so - called ' grey workers ' has increased by around 100,000 , equal to around 270 pensioners every single day			1
at this level , it means nearly ten per cent of those who are 65 and above have a job , with experts saying the number is almost guaranteed to keep on rising			1
for many pensioners , it is a positive choice			2
they enjoy their job , find it satisfying and are also keen to remain active in their old age			0
but many others are being forced into working – or even going back to work after retiring – because they simply can not afford to stop			2
@entity97 , a pensions analyst at the financial advisers , @entity98 , said the message is simple – if you want to retire young , start saving			0
he said : ' living to a ripe old age is a blessing if you can afford it – but a curse if you ca n't			0
' the government is unwilling to pay for an ever - increasing time spent in retirement			0
' those without sufficient savings will be left at the mercy of the state pension			0
' overall , the @entity5 said a typical man lives until the age of 85 in @entity41 and @entity42 , while a woman will typically survive until the age of 89			0
since 1960 , the average life span has jumped by around a decade for a man and eight years for a woman , it said .			0
