@entity0 insists he will do “ what is best for the club ” when it comes to making a decision on @entity6 ’s future			1
the @entity8 striker has been the subject of interest from a number of teams , notably @entity13			1
he has made 12 starts for @entity15 in all competitions so far and if he makes another three , he will automatically trigger a clause in contract that secures another year at @entity19			1
@entity6 made a bright start for @entity15 after joining them as a free agent in august but his impact has dwindled in recent weeks , raising the prospect that he will leave before the end of the transfer window			1
@entity0 , however , is in no hurry to make a firm conclusion			1
former @entity8 international @entity6 has been linked with a january move away from @entity19 @entity0 insists he will only give the @entity6 deal the thumbs up if it is the right thing for @entity15 ‘ we have had a couple of enquiries , but nothing concrete , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ with @entity6 , we are going to take a couple of weeks to decide what the next step will be			1
i do n’t rule anything out at the moment			2
‘ it may be that @entity6 stays with us			1
we are going to decide what is best for the club and for @entity44			2
’ the main issue for @entity0 in the transfer window is whether he will bring in goalkeeping cover			1
@entity48 is still injured and not expected to be fit until the middle of february , leaving the untried @entity50 as understudy to @entity52			2
‘ we are still in the same position as we were before , ’ he said			2
‘ we need a little bit of extra cover			0
we have got three terrific young keepers at the club but we just need that experience			2
we are going to look for a very specific profile			0
@entity0 , meanwhile , is ready to talk with @entity61 head coach @entity60 about his plans for @entity63 this summer and whether he will take him to the @entity64 for the @entity65			1
@entity60 ( left ) could name @entity63 in his @entity67 squad , @entity0 is n't sure @entity60 has raised the prospect that @entity63 , who only has one under 21 cap , could be part of his squad but @entity0 is not sure whether that will be the right move for the 21 - year - old , whose form has been the subject of some concern recently			1
‘ it depends on the type of role , ’ said @entity0			1
it is impossible to give a straight answer but we have a good relationship with the @entity83 and @entity60			0
@entity63 has been involved in the best possible tournament , which is the @entity85			2
i do n’t think other tournaments could be as positive			0
‘ those experiences with the @entity89 are to progress you to the senior level			0
once you get to senior level , you are then blocking someone ’s path			0
@entity63 has had terrific experiences but we will always be happy to assess it			2
we will speak about it , i am sure			0
’ @entity63 ( left ) is one of the @entity99 's hottest prospects and could feature for the @entity100 in the summer @entity15 have not won a game since december 15 and will look to rectify that on monday night against @entity103			1
@entity0 is wary of the threat they pose under new management			2
‘ i always admire what @entity107 has achieved , ’ he said			0
‘ he always found a way of making his team competitive with the players that he had			0
@entity113 evolved in the @entity99 and at @entity114 he found a way of using the wide men			0
his experience will be valuable for the second half of the season			0
‘ we are still involved in two competitions			0
february is going to be really challenging but we welcome that and we are looking forward to the busy periods that we have			0
we are looking into opportunities to go for a warm weather training camp			0
it gives you good opportunities			0
’ @entity107 will be hoping to continue @entity15 's woeful run of form when they meet on monday evening @entity0 will be hopeful that summer signing @entity131 can continue his recent run of improved form @entity131 celebrates what he thinks is the winner against @entity136 in the @entity137 on tuesday night			1
