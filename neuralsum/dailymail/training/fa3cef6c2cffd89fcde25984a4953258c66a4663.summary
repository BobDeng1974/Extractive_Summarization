by @entity0 for @entity1 deep in a @entity4 forest lies a secretive training facility intended to prepare people for a voyage into space			1
few outsiders have ever seen it with their own eyes - but one photographer has now gained rare access to the heart of the @entity4 space programme			2
@entity16 took the snaps of the highly secret @entity18 complex - known in @entity4 as @entity20 - inside forests around 30 miles ( 48 kilometres ) from @entity21			1
photographer @entity16 from @entity22 has taken rare photos of @entity4 's @entity18			1
the facility is located deep in a forest about 30 miles ( 48 km ) from @entity26 is a @entity28 spacesuit used by cosmonauts when travelling to and from space the centre , run by the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , is in a closed town where the legendary cosmonaut @entity34 trained			1
12 april 1961 - @entity36 human in space ( @entity34 ) 5 may 1961 - @entity38 in space ( @entity40 ) 16 june 1963 - @entity36 woman in space ( @entity41 ) 21 july 1969 - @entity36 human on the moon ( @entity45 ) 7 june 1971 - @entity36 manned space station ( @entity47 1 ) 12 april 1981 - first manned space plane ( @entity50 / @entity49 ) 20 november 1998 - @entity51 ( @entity52 ) begins 15 october 2003 - first @entity53 taikonaut in space ( @entity55 ) in fact it was previously named after @entity34 and his family still live within the area of the centre			0
today - despite the area no longer being a military zone in 2008 - it remains difficult for outsiders to gain access			0
' i grew up as self - proclaimed space fanatic - i was born in 1969 - and a photograph of @entity45 landing on the moon has always hung in every house i 've ever lived in and i 've met @entity71 , ' said mr @entity16 , from @entity22			2
' i grew up in the era of @entity73 and @entity74 and the @entity75 , however the @entity4 space programme was always on the fringes , always mysteriously out of reach i felt			2
' @entity18 is up and running and still the main space training centre for all international cosmonauts and astronauts visiting the space station as well as the centre for the @entity4 space programme			1
' it is located about 30 miles [ 48 kilometres ] east of @entity21 , set within a deeply wooded area and it does n't appear on any maps or have road signs			1
' it is a " closed " town - and very tricky to get access to and has a heavily guarded border and access is for residents and space trainees			0
' the @entity18 facility is located deep in a forest about 30 miles ( 48 km ) from @entity21 @entity18 is used to train astronauts and cosmonauts for missions to space			1
shown here is a centrifuge , which is used to test how cosmonauts respond to the intense g - forces experienced in take - off and landing training facilities like these are used by agencies to prepare astronauts for missions in space			2
seen here are mock - ups of modules from the @entity52 , which cosmonauts use to familiarise themselves with the layout before they travel to the space station the @entity28 spacesuit , shown , was first introduced in 1973 and is still in use by cosmonauts today			1
it is only worn during take - off and landing , however , and is used to keep astronauts alive in the event of their spacecraft depressurising			2
for spacewalks a separate @entity125 suit is used the centre was established in the 1960s and was originally called the @entity18			0
since then it has trained at least 400 astronauts - or cosmonauts as they are called in @entity4 - from more than 30 different countries			1
' ' all personnel involved in the @entity135 and @entity4 space programme , and their descendants have the right to live here , ' mr @entity16 continued			2
' it houses both space training installation buildings , as well as accommodation , shop , church and a school			0
@entity34 's family still live here			0
' mr @entity16 said inside the complex there were several life - size mock - ups of the @entity52 used for training			1
one is even submerged in a swimming pool where cosmonauts can practice their space walks , although mr @entity16 was not allowed to take photos in this area			2
seen here is a mural of historic @entity4 space achievements			0
on the left is the short - lived @entity160 shuttle that completed one unmanned flight in 1988			0
in the middle is @entity163 1 , the world 's first artificial satellite , which launched in 1957			0
on the right is @entity160 attached to the energia rocket that took it to space the facility is used to prepare astronauts and cosmonauts for trips to the @entity52 ( pictured ) shown here is a mock - up of the @entity47 spacecraft used to take astronauts to the @entity47 family of spacecraft has been in operation since the 1960s , although it has been continuously upgraded since then shown here is a statue of @entity34 , who on 12 april 1961 became the first human ever to travel to space			1
@entity18 was once also known as the @entity18 the centre also contains technology from the history of @entity4 's space endeavours ( shown )			1
there is also a mock - up of the @entity52 in a swimming pool cosmonauts can use , although mr @entity16 was not allowed to take photos in this area ' all cosmonauts from the @entity135 space programme and then the @entity197 have trained at this facility , ' he added			1
' the facility has a very lived in look , but is cared for with such obvious pride			0
the heart and soul of the @entity4 space programme , and indeed the @entity4 people , can be felt very profoundly here			0
' dreams of outer space have been a constant in @entity135 society since the 1920s , which have survived perestroika and the break up of the @entity211 in 1991			0
' @entity212 was limited , and although i was able to walk around with my guide freely i was not able to take photographs [ everywhere ]			0
' the image of the lake @entity34 helped to dig , the supermarket where all goods are plentiful and cheap , the washing of the current space team pegged to a green nylon rail - will forever be those images i wish i had taken			0
' ' it is a " closed " town - and very tricky to get access to and has a heavily guarded border and access is for residents and space trainees , ' said mr @entity230			0
shown is a mock - up of a docking module on the @entity52 the facility apparently has a very lived in look but is ' cared for with pride ' according to mr @entity230			2
seen on the left are some interconnected mock - ups of @entity52 modules at @entity18 , while on the right is @entity242 's own @entity52 mockup at the @entity243			1

@entity16 has taken rare images of @entity4 's @entity18
the facility is located deep in a forest about 30 miles ( 48km ) from @entity21
it is used to train astronauts and cosmonauts for missions to space
established in 1960 , it has trained more than 400 space travellers
the pictures reveal mock - ups of the iss and spacecraft used for training
there are also pieces of *memorabilia* from @entity4 's space history
