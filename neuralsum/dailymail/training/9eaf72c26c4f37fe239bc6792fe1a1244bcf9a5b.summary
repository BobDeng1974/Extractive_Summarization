by @entity1 reporter published : 18:28 est , 30 november 2013 @entity3 : 12:24 est , 1 december 2013 @entity5 's crippling illness has made her a prisoner in her own home for the last 60 years			1
paralyzed by polio at age five , the @entity9 woman has spent most of her life encased in a 1940s respirator which breathes for her			1
but the 65 - year - old could n't imagine life any other way			1
@entity5 , 65 , has lived inside an iron lung like this one since she was five - years - old ' some people have said i ’d rather die than leave my iron lung , and it makes it sound like i ’m not trying to be modern , and it ’s not like that at all , ' she told @entity24			1
' it feels wonderful , actually , if you ’re not breathing well			0
when i was first put into it , it was such a relief			0
it makes all the difference when you ’re not breathing			0
' @entity5 has learned to live with her disease			1
she taught herself to walk again			0
while she can leave the 800 - pound respirator , she prefers not to			1
@entity5 lies on a goose down comforter inside a long metal cylinder in which she ’s enclosed with an airtight seal			1
her neck and head sticks out of a foam collar			0
there are switches inside to allow her to roll a tray - like cot in and out			1
she lives with her three beagles , and a housemate who helps care for her			2
she stays in touch with friends by phone and internet			0
@entity5 owns her iron lung , which runs on a fan belt motor that friends help patch together with car parts when it breaks			1
she said it 's a better option than portable positive pressure ventilators which most polio survivors use			1
they force air into the lungs , often through a tube in the throat			1
' if i use the positive pressure vent , i ’m not as well rested , ' she said			2
@entity5 told @entity66 about her experience			1
' i was paralyzed all over except my @entity68 was unconscious & turning blue when they put me in the lung			2
i was in it for six month in hospital , during which time i learned to breathe for 30 seconds and longer on my own			2
it was @entity77 hen you ca n't breathe much , you ca n't talk , cry or make a sound			2
doctors said i would n't ever be out of the lung or walk			2
i was determined to do both ! ' she says that after the time she spent in hospital she regained 25 % of her breathing and after a year of work she learned to walk			2
' i would love to not need any vent & would like not to have the weakening that comes with @entity91			0
i ca n't use other types of ventilators because of inflammation that comes with @entity95			0
i could be more rested if i stayed in the lung full time			0
but i choose to be up as much as @entity97 the vaccine ! ' this undated photo shows a woman lying inside an iron lung @entity5 considers herself an anomaly in a @entity104 society that barely remembers the scourge of polio - a viral infection of the spinal cord that mainly affected young children			1
but with reports polio has reared its ugly head in @entity112 and @entity113 , @entity5 wants to make sure that people never forget			1
' i think the word is to get your child vaccinated			0
why would we let somebody have to go back through that again ? ' she said			0
' if my mother would have had the opportunity to give me the vaccine , she would have done that			0
' @entity5 was a kindergartner in 1953 when she woke up with a sore throat that quickly progressed to poliovirus			2
the virus is transmitted through contaminated food and water			0
' the night before i was paralyzed , the neighbor children ate out of the same bowl of pancake batter that i did , ' @entity5 said			1
' they just had to pray that nobody got it			0
' the first known outbreak of polio in the @entity104 was in 1894 in @entity138			0
in 1952 , a record 57,628 cases of polio were reported in the @entity104			0

@entity5 , 65 , was paralyzed by polio at age five
the @entity9 *resident* has spent most of her life inside an 800 - pound iron lung that helps her breathe
the respirator , built in the 1940s , increases and *decreases* the air pressure to expand and contract @entity5 's lungs
she is a *staunch* advocate of vaccinations
