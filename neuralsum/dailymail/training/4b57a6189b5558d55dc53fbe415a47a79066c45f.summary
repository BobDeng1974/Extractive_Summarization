it is just two months since @entity1 was engulfed in a fireball that razed off 25 per cent of her skin			1
but the 16 - year - old has made an incredible recovery			2
on november 10 , while home alone in @entity9 , @entity10 , a freak explosion burned off her finger tips , hair , eyebrows and eyelashes , and obliterated the skin from her arms , back , legs , face , and stomach with third - degree burns			1
incredibly , she has survived - and this week she took the ultimate step : going back to school			1
transformation : @entity1 , 16 , pictured left in september 2014 before the fire ; center in november 2014 in @entity26 's @entity25 ; and right in january 2015 as she prepares to go back to school before and after : the freak explosion in her house left @entity1 ( pictured left and right ) with life - changing burns ' i guess i 'm just lucky , ' @entity1 said to @entity35 in a stunning tone of bravery that even shocked her doctors			1
' it makes you stronger			0
you do n't take anything for granted			0
i know there 's worse things that can happen			0
' few could imagine anything much worse than lighting a candle to get rid of a foul smell , then almost burning to death			1
the fire was so aggressive it went right to the fat beneath her skin , leaving her hands milk - bottle white			2
' it felt normal , ' she said			0
' my body felt the same , kind of numb			0
i remember it was really hot , but it did n't hurt			0
' her mother and stepfather were at work when the house exploded and @entity1 ran out the half - destroyed walls into the street on fire			1
trauma : the 16 - year - old was home alone in @entity72 , @entity10 , when she lit a candle and the house exploded horror : the fire was so aggressive it went right to the fat beneath her skin , leaving her hands milk - bottle white ' i 'm just so lucky ' : the high school junior said she is just grateful she survived the fireball that engulfed her painstaking : getting ready for school used to take two minutes and now takes a minimum of ten neighbors rushed to throw buckets of water over the high school junior , call 911 , and call her parents			1
she was rushed to a helipad with her mother then flown to @entity94 20 minutes away , then transferred to the specialist unit at @entity26 's down the road where her father met them			0
in the emergency room doctors cut open her arms in a desperate bid to reduce the swelling , while she was given oxygen , an iv , and doused in antibiotic solution			1
after four operations , skin grafts on her hands , and two months of physiotherapy , @entity1 has returned to @entity110 , where she is honor student and plays soccer			1
' it feels good , ' she told @entity35 as she sat beaming in her bandages at the school 's opening assembly			2
battling through : she has had to endure hours of physiotherapy a day such as picking up toothpicks effort : every little task is difficult after the fire on november 10 , 2014 , razed all the skin from her fingertips happy to be back : @entity1 said ' it feels good ' to return to @entity110 , where she is an honor student moving on : she has pushed herself to go out in public despite the scarring experience and marked injuries investigators are still working to understand the cause of the fire , which is likely to have been a propane gas leak			1
' she had told us she arrived home and went into the house and smelled a strange odor , and lit a candle to combat the odor , and the house exploded , ' @entity72 fire chief @entity138 said			1
' there was propane provided to the home from a tank around back			2
not sure if that was it or not , we 'll have to do some investigating to figure out if that was the cause			0
' he added : ' propane is heavier than your oxygen level , your normal oxygen , so it 's going to build up in the floor , under the floor , anywhere it can until it meets an ignition source			0
' and that may very well have been the candle			2
not saying that 's what it was , but it could have been			0
' the blast was very significant			0
so the young girl is very lucky to be alive today			0
