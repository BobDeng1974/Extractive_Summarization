by @entity0 when it comes to finding the right bra , even the most proficient shoppers often despair			0
with so many options on the market in differing shapes , styles and sizes , and fitting services rather hit and miss , it comes as no surprise that a recent study found that 85 per cent of women are wearing the wrong size bras			2
but a new app - researched by a @entity17 scientist - claims to solve the problem once and for all by calculating a woman 's bra size all in the flash of an @entity22			1
@entity23 promises to give women accurate bra measurements by measuring their diameters when they take two selfies - and then directs you to their store to buy one @entity29 , a start - up app that has already raised $ 5.6m ( Â£ 3.61m ) from investors , works by taking two pictures of a user wearing a tight vest top			1
the app then renders three - dimensional data from the two - dimensional photos you have snapped of yourself and calculates your precise measurements			1
featuring a female 's tutorial voice , the app then suggest bras and underwear that you should buy ( from their own store ) which they claim should fit you like a glove			0
the app was founded by @entity47 , a former partner at @entity49 , and @entity50 , a senior scientist with the @entity51 at @entity52 , is also involved			2
@entity50 explained the technicalities behind the app to @entity54 saying that the back end ' involves several methods of advanced computer vision , body modelling , and machine learning '			0
the tool is able to estimate the parameters of the camera , making the @entity22 a calibration object			0
with 85 per cent of women in the @entity65 wearing the wrong bra size , the new app - which was research by a @entity17 scientist - wants to change that when it has calculated those parameters , it is then possible to accurately give predicted measurements of a @entity75 object - in the case of this app the human body - using 2 - @entity78 images			1
@entity23 already has big plans for the future and eventually wants to expand its intelligent fitting service to encompass other types of clothing			0
a communications executive at the @entity52 contacted @entity54 to reiterate that @entity50 is a contracted researcher and that ' no @entity17 software , technology , equipment or facilities were used in mr. @entity50 's consulting to @entity91			2

@entity23 promises to give women accurate bra measurements
senior scientist at @entity17 is behind app 's technology
works by analysing two photographs of user wearing a tight top
then renders three - dimensional data from the two - dimensional photos
borne of research that showed 85 *%* of women wear wrong bra size
