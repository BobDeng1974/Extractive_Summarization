three students who featured prominently in a now under - question @entity2 article about rape at the @entity5 , have revealed their identities to refute their cold portrayal in the sickening story			1
the article sent shockwaves through the university community , after the magazine published a female student 's account of being gang - raped by seven men at a @entity5 fraternity two years ago , leading to the temporary shut down of all @entity19 life at the @entity21 campus			1
next to victim ' @entity23 's ' account of the horrifying assault , one of the most appalling aspects of the story are the apathetic reactions of her three friends ' @entity30 ' , ' @entity32 ' and ' @entity33 ' who she called for help after escaping the frat that night in september 2012			1
the trio are now coming forward to refute key aspects of the @entity2 article , saying that while they believe @entity23 was the victim of a ' traumatic ' sexual assault they have found several inaccuracies in the article and are skeptical of the story			1
furthermore , the students say they never discouraged her from reporting the assault , and that they only stopped insisting she contact police when she asked to be taken back to her dorm room			2
misrepresented ? these are the three friends who ran to alleged rape victim @entity23 's aid , the night she told @entity2 she was gang raped by seven men at @entity5 's @entity56 fraternity house			1
identified as @entity33 , @entity32 and @entity30 in the article , they say their real names are @entity59 ( left ) , @entity60 ( center ) and @entity62 ( asked for his last name to be withheld , right ) ' the text was so divergent from what we said that evening , ' @entity60 , who was identified as ' @entity32 in the article , told @entity68 on thursday			1
in the article @entity23 describes meeting a junior boy identified as ' @entity71 ' her first few weeks at @entity5 , and how the fellow lifeguard asked her out to dinner and a date night function at the @entity75			1
back at the house , she says she was lured to an upstairs bedroom , where she was thrown through a glass table and then raped one by one by seven men in what appeared to be an initiation ritual			2
when she came to in the early hours of the next morning , @entity23 says she fled the house barefoot and then called @entity30 , @entity32 and @entity33 for help			1
she says the trio tracked her down to find her bloody and in shock , but described how they were hesitant to report the crime , fearing how it would impact their social lives , the boys ' intentions to rush a fraternity and @entity23 's college reputation			1
that 's not how the three friends remember the incident			0
victim : @entity23 ( pictured ) told @entity2 she was violently assaulted by seven men in a fraternity house two weeks into her first year at @entity5 the friend identified as ' @entity30 ' in the story , says he was the only one @entity23 called that night , contrary to the description of all three responding in unison			1
he says his real name is @entity62 , but asked @entity68 to withhold his last name			0
@entity62 says he found @entity23 outside her dorm ' crying and shaking ' and that she told him she was forced to perform oral sex on five men in the frat while a sixth watched			1
he says he then called @entity110 , but that @entity23 asked the student identified as ' @entity33 ' not to come			1
that student has revealed her name to by @entity59 , and says she came along with @entity60 anyway , but stood back from the group while @entity23 told her story to the two boys			1
@entity59 directly refutes a line in the article , which quotes her as saying ' she 's gon na be the girl who cried " rape " and we 'll never be allowed into a frat party again			2
' she says she only heard details of the rape later , first from @entity110 , then from @entity124 herself			0
horrified by the story , the friends say they urged @entity23 to report the incident to police , but that she declined and asked to go back to her dorm where two of them spent the night comforting her			1
' i mean obviously we were very concerned for her , ' @entity60 told the @entity134			0
' we tried to be as supportive as we could be			0
' the friends also added that @entity23 did not appear to be injured , despite her account that she was bleeding significantly from being thrown through a glass table			2
further , they also had doubts about her attacker			0
wrong : @entity23 identified @entity56 - known as @entity140 for short - as the frat house where the attack took place but told the @entity134 she only did so because a friend pointed to it a year later and told her : ' that 's where it happened			1
' her father said she had got the detail wrong this past week , @entity23 finally named the lifeguard who took her back to the frat to her new friends , but when a reporter gave @entity30 , @entity33 and @entity32 that name , they said they had never heard of it before			1
@entity5 officials also found the name suspect , saying that no one with that name has ever attended the school			0
the @entity134 interviewed a man with a similar name , and he admitted to working at the pool with her , he says he never met her in person and was not a member of @entity170			0
the fraternity released a separate statement saying no @entity170 brother was working at the aquatic center at that time and that they did n't hold an official social event on the weekend in question			0
at the time , @entity23 's friends were under the impression that her date was a junior she met through her chemistry class that year			2
@entity23 started talking about this mystery man when @entity30 rebuffed her romantic advances , wanting to stay friends			2
when she revealed that an older student in her chemistry class had been asking her out on dates , the three friends say they took his number from her phone out of curiosity and started texting the stranger			0
the person they talked to wrote about ' this super smart hot ' freshman and how they both shared of a love of the band @entity197 , according to the two - year - old messages shown to the @entity134			0
' i really like this girl , ' the guy said in one message			0
he also sent pictures of himself , showing he had a distinct jawline and blue eyes			0
but the messages also hinted at @entity23 's crush on @entity30 , since the student wrote that she was interested in someone else and refused to date her			1
' get this she said she likes some other 1st year guy who dosnt ( sp ) like her and turned her down but she wont date me cause she likes him			0
she cant turn my down fro some nerd 1st yr. she said this kid is smart and funny and worth it , ' the older student wrote			0
eventually , @entity23 told her friends that she succumbed and accepted a date from the older student for friday , september 28 , 2012			2
adding even more mystery to the already confusing story , the @entity134 identified the man in the text messages from his pictures , and it turns out he went to high school with @entity23 in northern @entity227			2
however , that man , now a junior at a school in a different state , says he ' never really spoke with her ' , did not attend @entity5 , was not a member of any fraternity and had n't been to @entity21 in at least six years			0
on the specific weekend when @entity23 said she was raped , he was at an athletic event in a different state , and the pictures of him that were messaged to @entity23 's friends appear to have been pulled from his social media accounts			1
@entity23 's friends also had a hard time finding her crush on social media , adding that they never met him in person and now fear they had never been messaging with him in the first place			1
while they are skeptical of details of the night described in the @entity2 article , they all agree that something happened to leave @entity23 terrified			1
' she had very clearly just experienced a horrific trauma , ' @entity30 said			0
' i had never seen anybody acting like she was on that night before and i really hope i never have to again			0
... if she was acting on the night of sept. 28 , 2012 , then she deserves an @entity250			0
both @entity30 and @entity32 say they 've been interviewed by the @entity252 , who were asked by the university to start an investigation into the alleged incident			2
@entity2 has issued an apology for the story , initially saying their trust in @entity23 was ' misplaced '			2
they have stopped commenting on the article , while conducting an internal review			0
on wednesday , the lawyer representing @entity23 asked reporters to stop contacting her and her family			0
' as i am sure you all can understand , all of this has been very stressful , overwhelming and retraumatizing for @entity23 and her family , ' @entity23 's lawyer @entity265 said .			2
