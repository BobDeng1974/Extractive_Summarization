by @entity1 reporter it 's every @entity5 fan 's dream come true - a real - life go kart that @entity7 himself would be proud to race through @entity9			2
@entity11 gadget guru @entity10 , 34 , has come up with a vehicle that not only goes forwards , but sideways and backwards			1
' @entity14 ' even allows drivers to spin and skid around corners thanks to a special control handle to help it ' drift ' just like @entity7 and friends in the hit computer game @entity23			1
but despite its runaway success , when @entity10 first came up with the idea , everybody called him crazy ... so that 's exactly what he called the fledgeling invention			1
but when he took his idea to @entity60 ’s @entity59 a decade ago , recruiters were incensed to hear he hoped to use his time there to develop the @entity14			1
' it was like something from a movie , ' he told @entity67			0
' she stood up and slammed her hand on the table			0
" if you think you ’re coming to @entity59 with a go - kart and being successful , then you have no idea what you ’re in for			0
" ' i told her , " if you think your opinion of my chances of being successful is going to stop my idea from being a success , you have no idea who you ’re sitting across the table from			0
" ' luckily , though , his outburst paid off and the recruiter was so impressed by his passion that she not only accepted him on the course but secured a $ 20,000 grant to develop the project over the summer between his first and second year			0
and as this ' ride guide ' video shows , it has 360 - degree steering and a drift bar for managing spins , drifts , and cornering			2
it also has two driving modes : ' go - kart mode ' for normal driving , and ' crazy cart mode ' for drifting			0
manufacturer razor previously made a smaller version for children , but has now decided to manufacture an adult one			0
initial prototypes hit problems , the firm found , as they would not fit through doors , but a new slightly slimmer model is now on sale			0
@entity10 , along with the development team at @entity117 , worked on the @entity14 for nine years until it hit stores in the @entity11 , @entity119 and @entity120 in 2013			1
a la modes : it also has two driving modes : ' go - kart mode ' for normal driving ( left ) , and ' crazy cart mode ' for dri ' the @entity14 ’s success is an amazing metaphor for the incredible ride we 've experienced since we first introduced the original @entity117 kick scooter to @entity11 , ' said @entity117 ’s founder and president , @entity132			1
' @entity117 ’s goal is to find innovative ride - ons with break - out appeal , and the @entity14 is absolutely living up to our hopes as one of the hottest products in our 13 - year history			1
