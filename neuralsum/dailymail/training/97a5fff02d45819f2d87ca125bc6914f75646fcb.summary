by @entity0 from the humble sandwich to an expensive salad , there are few dishes that do n't taste better with bacon			1
and now , the point has been even mathematically proven			0
a massive number - crunching exercise has revealed that dishes with bacon really do taste better - and very few taste worse			1
better with bacon : new research has found that virtually every dish - especially sandwiches - taste better when a rasher or two is added @entity18 magazine @entity17 teamed up with the @entity19 to analyse 50,000 recipes and 906,539 comments on them			1
previous research has pinpointed the exact chemical reaction that makes bacon so smell so tempting			0
called the @entity27 reaction , it occurs between an amino acid and a reducing sugar when heated			0
the acid and sugar react to release a huge amount of smells and flavour that make us salivate			0
@entity36 , of the @entity38 education centre in @entity39 , explained the reaction releases hundreds of smells and flavours , but it is the smell which reels in the eater			0
' if we could n't smell , then taste would n't be the same			0
' explaining how the results were calculated , @entity17 writer @entity45 said : ' first , we searched out all the recipes that fit a certain description - sandwiches , for example			1
' then , we calculated the average rating for those foods if they did not include the word “ bacon			1
” ' we ran the numbers again using only recipes that did include bacon			1
of all the foods we analysed , bacon lends the most improvement to sandwiches			2
' many other dishes also got a boost when bacon was added - when the data was analysed , those with with a rasher or two included got better scores			1
there are various theories as to why - not least because of the crunch and flavour bacon adds to sandwiches			2
it 's also a good addition to salads - providing it does n't go soggy			0
recipes with spinach and asparagus were all rated better when they contained bacon , for example			2
but it was n't all good news			0
there are foods that get worse with bacon - namely pasta ( particularly in creamy sauces ) and , rather unsurprisingly , desserts			1
the data analysis also gave a fascinating snapshot into the most popular foods through the last few years			1
the data analysis also gave a fascinating snapshot into the most popular foods through the last few years , including the surge in popularity of cupcakes since 2009 two major trends are the surge in popularity of cupcakes and gluten - free products since 2009 , while salted caramel and sriacha ( hot sauce from @entity103 ) have soared in popularity since 2011			1
on the other hand , portobello mushrooms and low carb diets were big in 2007 , but have nose dived since then			1
the trends were calculated by findings the total number of reviews for each food			0
@entity17 and the @entity19 then calculated what percentage of the recipe reviews came in each quarter since 2007			2
but the results clearly show one thing : bacon has always been popular			2
previous research has pinpointed the exact chemical reaction that makes bacon so tasty			0
called the @entity27 reaction , it occurs between an amino acid and a reducing sugar when heated			0

analysis of 50,000 recipes and 906,539 comments on the @entity19 revealed that very few dishes taste worse when bacon is added
only *exceptions* were pasta dishes ( especially creamy ones ) and desserts
@entity144 also revealed snapshot into the most popular foods through the last few years - with salted caramel and cupcakes soaring in popularity
but low - carb diets and portobello mushrooms are no *longer* trendy
