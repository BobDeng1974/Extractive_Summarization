by @entity1 reporter published : 17:57 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 03:48 est , 7 march 2014 new research has found that some people are just incapable of ' getting ' or being able to derive enjoyment from music few things can stir the emotions like a piece of music – an experience that was thought to be shared by all			1
but it turns out that some are completely immune to its charms			0
scientists at the @entity18 in @entity19 have discovered that a minority of people who are perfectly able to experience pleasure in other ways simply do n’t ‘ get ’ music			1
the new condition , which has been named musical anhedonia , was found by scientist @entity27			1
he said : ‘ the identification of these individuals could be very important to understanding how a set of notes is translated into emotions			0
’ in research on how we respond to rewards , he found those left unmoved by music could still find pleasure in other ways , such as winning money			1
he added : ‘ there might be different ways to access the reward system			0
some might be more effective than others			0
’ the researchers previously found hints about this form of anhedonia after they developed a questionnaire to evaluate individual differences in musical reward			1
the evaluations found some people who reported low sensitivity to music but average sensitivity to other kinds of reward			1
however , multiple explanations are possible for these low music sensitivities			0
for instance , some people might seem to dislike music because they have trouble perceiving it , a condition called amusia			2
for the current study , the research team decided to look more closely at three groups of 10 people , with each group consisting of participants with high pleasure ratings in response to music , average pleasure ratings in response to music , or low sensitivity to musical reward , respectively			1
they were chosen based on their comparable overall sensitivity to other types of rewards and their ability to perceive music			2
they took part in two different experiments : a music task , in which they had to rate the degree of pleasure they were experiencing while listening to pleasant music , and a monetary incentive delay task , in which they had to respond quickly to a target in order to win or avoid losing real money			2
most are able to enjoy music , with it bringing up pleasurable memories or provoking an emotional reaction where the brain perceives reward both tasks have been shown to engage reward - related neural circuits and produce a rush of dopamine			0
meanwhile , the researchers recorded changes of skin conductance response and heart rate as physiologic indicators of emotion			0
the results were clear : some otherwise healthy and happy people do not enjoy music and show no autonomic responses to its sound , despite normal musical perception capacities			2
those people do respond to monetary rewards , which shows that low sensitivity to music is n't tied to some global abnormality of the reward network			1
the researchers say their findings might lead to new understandings of the reward system , with implications for pathologies including addiction and affective disorders			0
@entity137 added : ' the idea that people can be sensitive to one type of reward and not to another suggests that there might be different ways to access the reward system and that , for each person , some ways might be more effective than others			0

musical anhedonia was found by scientists in @entity18
minority of people are not able to experience pleasure in music
these people can still find pleasure in other ways , like winning money
tests *challenged* people to evaluate differences in musical rewards
people found certain people could n't discern between different rewards
