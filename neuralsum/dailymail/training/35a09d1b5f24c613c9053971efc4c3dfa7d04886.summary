it is 60 years to the day since she learned her beloved father , @entity2 , had died suddenly			2
in a heartbeat the strong , dutiful – but still unbelievably young – woman of 25 was thrust on to the world stage			2
now aged 85 , the @entity6 is a proud grandmother eight times over , with one great - grandchild and another on the way			2
long to reign over us : the new portrait of the @entity6 and prince @entity11 by photographer @entity12 that has been released on the 60th anniversary of her majesty 's accession to the throne today , however , she makes clear that thoughts of retirement are far from her mind as she formally rededicates herself to her nation			1
in a statement to mark the start of her diamond jubilee year , the @entity6 – only the second monarch after her great great grandmother @entity26 to celebrate 60 years on the @entity28 throne – vows once again to serve her people for the rest of her life			1
her message is interesting because , unlike addresses issued to mark her silver and golden jubilees , the @entity6 takes the opportunity to rededicate herself to her people , scotching rumours that she might abdicate in favour of her son and heir , prince @entity41			1
she also hopes the dozens of planned commemorative events do more than just celebrate her milestone but remind us in times of economic crisis and social breakdown of the importance of family , friends and ‘ good neighbourliness ’			1
in the statement , issued by @entity54 , she says she and prince @entity11 have been ‘ deeply moved to receive so many kind messages about the diamond jubilee ’			1
she continues : ‘ in this special year , as i dedicate myself anew to your service , i hope that we will all be reminded of the power of togetherness and the convening strength of family , friendship and good neighbourliness			1
‘ i hope also that this jubilee year will be a time to give thanks for the great advances that have been made since 1952 and to look forward to the future with clear head and warm heart as we join together in our celebrations			2
’ royal visit : the @entity6 attended church near @entity76 alongside her husband yesterday as the couple prepared for the anniversary smiles : prince @entity11 and @entity6 looked happy ahead of the church service despite the freezing weather meet and greet : the @entity85 couple were offered flowers by children following the service , with one young boy even offering a packet of @entity92 's originals to the prince on the eve of today ’s commemorations , the @entity6 and @entity11 yesterday attended a service at the church on her @entity76 estate in @entity99			1
today , unusually , she will spend the anniversary of her accession in public , conducting a series of engagements close to @entity76 , after a private mass at which she will remember the gentle father she idolised			1
first she will visit @entity107 town hall before travelling to @entity108 and @entity109 where she will watch a play about her 60 years as sovereign performed by the children			0
a new picture of the @entity6 and @entity11 has also been issued to celebrate her milestone			0
close : the then princess @entity115 is pictured with her father @entity2 in april 1944			0
despite continuing health problems he died suddenly accession : dressed in black , her majesty arrives back in the @entity28 from a @entity122 in february 7 , 1952 , the day after she heard of her father 's death while on a state visit to the country celebrations : the @entity6 is seen during her @entity128 in 2002 , left , while he laughs after being given this posy of flowers during the 1977 @entity132 taken at @entity54 in december by photographer @entity12 , it shows the queen in a dress of white silk , satin and lace with the 1820 state diadem on her head , while @entity11 wears the @entity141 ceremonial day dress of an @entity142 with his @entity144 sash			0
former prime minister sir @entity145 yesterday dismissed any suggestion that the @entity6 would ever relinquish the throne early or that prince @entity148 would be the next king			0
‘ @entity6 took an oath at the coronation that she would remain as @entity6 for the rest of her life , ’ he said			0
‘ when , hopefully many years hence , the @entity6 is no longer with us , prince @entity41 will become king			0
‘ after prince @entity41 will come prince @entity148			0
that is , i think , a matter that is beyond doubt			0
