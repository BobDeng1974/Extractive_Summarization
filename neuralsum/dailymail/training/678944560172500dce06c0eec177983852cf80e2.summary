by @entity0 a @entity2 builder who was left with half a head after a bad fall at work has had his skull rebuilt thanks to donations from well - wishers			1
disfigured and unable to work , @entity11 , from @entity12 , north - west @entity2 , could not afford the 1,000 euros he needed to pay for a prosthetic to replace the missing parts of his skull			1
but after his story was reported in @entity19 and elsewhere earlier this year , generous readers who took pity on his plight sent him money to help pay for his surgery			0
' i feel much better now , i thank @entity38 for the second chance he has given to me			0
i also want to thank all the people for their help , and not to forget the doctors for their help for this surgery , ' he said			0
mr @entity11 had been working on scaffolding around a demolition site last year when he lost his balance and fell six feet , smashing his head on the concrete below			1
the hard landing shattered the left side of his skull and put him in a coma			1
he developed a blood clot on his brain and doctors were forced to remove the damaged parts of bone to save his life			2
restored : viewed from the side , you can see the scar where mr @entity11 's prosthetic has been placed			1
before the operation , mr @entity62 could n't work because his vulnerable brain was protected only by skin although @entity2 , like @entity67 , has free universal healthcare , coverage did not extend to the surgery mr @entity11 needed to repair his skull , and he was forced to live with his disfigurement			1
with his brain protected only by skin stretched across the remaining portions of his skull , he was left unable to work since the slightest knock on his head could have proved fatal			1
' i prayed to @entity38 all the time to help me , every sunday i go to church and pray , ' he said			0
' when i was in the hospital [ after the accident ] i was scared that i would never get back to normal , especially when i saw myself in the mirror with half a head			2
' after a week in hospital i went home , where i spent three months recovering			0
altogether i was left with half a head for 13 months			2
' i could n't afford to have my head fixed so i decided to go on the street and beg people for money			1
' ' i thank @entity38 for the second chance ' : mr @entity11 said that after a year out of work , he hopes to get back soon local journalist @entity90 discovered mr @entity11 and filmed an interview with him in an effort to highlight his situation			1
after that , news outlets worldwide picked up the story			0
now , thanks to readers who took pity on mr @entity62 and reached out to help , he has had the life - changing surgery he needed to get him back to normal			2
' i was n't afraid for the second surgery to repair my head either because i told myself that if i got over the first one , i will get over this one too , ' he said			2
he added : ' the surgery took four or five hours			0
i did n't look in the mirror immediately after			0
three days after a nurse came to change my bandages and i asked her to take a picture on me on a phone so i could send it to my family			0
' when i saw myself i was very happy to finally be back to normal			0
' my family were very happy for me too , i have n't been able to work for a year but i help my family with everything i can and i hope to get back to work very soon			1

elvis @entity11 could n't afford a prosthetic *implant* to replace his skull
he was left without work for a year because his brain was so vulnerable
the *original* accident left him in a coma and a *bloodclot* nearly killed him
he hopes to get his life back on track now that his head is repaired
