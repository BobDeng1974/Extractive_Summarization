they are considered the world 's greatest natural and man - made wonders attracting millions of awe - inspired tourists from around the world every year			1
but many discerning members of @entity6 were less than impressed , giving @entity7 , the @entity8 , @entity9 and many other sites one - star reviews			1
one said the statue in @entity13 was ' just a pillar ' and described it as ' a pathetic and shoddy piece of concrete '			0
in a review warning people not to bother with the @entity8 , it is described as an ' overblown sandy ditch ' by a disgruntled visitor who wished he 'd ' stayed in my hotel room and watched a dvd instead '			2
one said : ' @entity9 is boring and quite possibly the most boring thing you could do			1
also it 's so expensive you should take that money and stay at a @entity52 for the night			2
and do n't take the boat			0
it lasts for 10 minutes and you wait for 3 hours '			0
another said : ' @entity57 is the pits everywhere i looked litter over flowing from buckets			0
people were just dropping stuff everywhere '			0
across @entity65 in @entity66 , there are several complaints about the city 's famous @entity68			1
one couple were ' unhappy ' saying that its ' colour was not as advertised ' and another reviewer called it ' pointless visiting ' say that people should ' buy a postcard instead '			1
tourists were also disappointed with the @entity77 at @entity78 in @entity79 , with several complaining it was ' tiny ' and one upset holidaymaker saying it was ' covered in litter and next to @entity84 '			0
@entity77 and the @entity85 : tourists called the @entity77 ' tiny ' and surrounded by ' @entity87 '			2
visitors to the @entity85 said it was just camels and brits in leggings another one - star review said it was ' surrounded ' by ' @entity87 who will steal from you and harass you from the moment you arrive until all you want to do is leave '			1
meanwhile one reviewer criticised the nearby pyramids of @entity78 , calling his experience ' horrendous '			1
he wrote : ' the pyramids are nice to look at and are definitely something to see , however that is if you can see past the dying / dead horses and dogs , and people harassing you for money on camels , coupled with overweight brits wearing see through leggings			1
' @entity113 's @entity112 was called ' just a bunch of stones in a field ' that keeps visitors interested for ' a second or two '			1
one visitor to @entity119 asked : ' where 's the wall ? ' and said anyone thinking of going should n't bother and head to @entity124 instead for ' better ruins , better weather and better food '			2
another said people would have ' more fun at a funeral ' than at @entity119			0
@entity132 did not fare any better in the scathing reviews with some observant reviewers calling it ' just a big clock			1
' @entity137 : the @entity139 landmark was written off as an ' ugly waste of time ' set in one of the world 's dirtiest cities one reviewer wrote : ' its just a big clock and the whole experience left me unsettled ' while a reviewer gave it a one - star review because he ' could n't see @entity132 anywhere '			1
another @entity113 attraction slapped with a one star rating is the @entity154 in @entity155 which was dubbed as ' @entity156 ' and an ' horrendous item ' that ' looks like an aeroplane that has been upended and planted cockpit first '			2
the @entity160 , home to the @entity162 and the @entity163 , was also dealt a blow with visitors scoring it one star and branding it ' coma inducing '			2
a @entity169 reviewer said : ' i 'm really sorry , but i just do n't see the lure to this museum			2
my son and i really tried to like the exhibits but it was just so so boring			0
' while another reviewer complained there was n't much @entity113 about it and said : ' sorry , but it would be empty without the @entity179 and @entity79			0
' @entity41 : the great @entity65 waterfall was branded a ' dump ' and the ' pits ' ruined by ' litter louts ' surrounded by ' rip - off ' shops @entity68 : unimpressed visitors to @entity66 said it was the wrong colour while another said it was just foggy and people should just buy a postcard instead the royal residence of @entity191 was slammed by one reviewer as a ' quintessential tourist trap '			1
the @entity194 in @entity195 earned a one star rating due to one visitor considering it ' nothing special '			0
a @entity199 reviewer warned tourists off visiting the @entity137 in @entity139 saying ' do n't go '			0
while a @entity203 reviewer said : ' the @entity137 is an ugly tower made popular by contemporary media , it is nothing really , but a waste of time to visit			0
' @entity119 : one visitor said it is ' more fun at a funeral ' and ' full of weirdos ' and another asked : ' where 's the wall ? ' @entity112 : the ancient stones in rural @entity113 are just ' big bits of stone in a big field ' and another said they would ' do anything ' to get the time spent there back the @entity220 has not escaped its share of bad reviews with one man saying he was ' pushed through like cattle by security who bellow out ' silenzio ' and ' sssh ' and patrol for those taking photos ! horrible			1
' whereas another reviewer told his fellow tourists ' do n't go inside ' the @entity233			0
