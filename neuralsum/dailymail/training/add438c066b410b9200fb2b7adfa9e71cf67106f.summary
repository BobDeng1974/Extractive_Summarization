@entity0 had a really good day , chipping away on a flat pitch and taking regular wickets to keep alive hopes of a series - levelling win			1
it was not the sort of surface where you could blast out the opposition , not the pitch we expected , but the one thing that has kept @entity0 interested is a bit of swing which keeps @entity15 in the game			1
just as the senior batsmen responded in this third test with runs for @entity20 and @entity21 , so the experienced bowlers in @entity15 and @entity23 were brilliant on tuesday			1
bad day at the office : @entity25 struggled against @entity26 on day three of the third test in @entity28 stick with him : @entity0 selectors must keep faith in @entity25 or risk ruining his confidence the way they kept going and found the right lengths was outstanding and @entity20 used them well			1
@entity25 had a bad day but the @entity0 selectors must not go back to the policy of ‘ in - out ’ with players that was such a problem in the bad old days			1
they then lose confidence and rhythm and do n’t know if they ’re coming or going			0
@entity0 should have made a decision between @entity43 and @entity44 at the start of this summer and stuck by it			2
what do they do at @entity48 ? leave @entity25 out and bring @entity44 back ? @entity25 has a few technical issues but they were there before and he needs to bowl and bowl			0
he has a bit of a jerky action , as well as this quirk with his thumb across the seam and three fingers on the ball			0
he ’s got things that can go wrong and then finds himself in trouble			0
bring on the big guns : @entity15 and @entity23 ( r ) stepped up to give @entity0 hope of levelling if you ’re out of form as a batsman you can nick it and walk off but if you ’re a bowler you have to stay out there and work through it			1
the fact we did n’t mention @entity72 much throughout the day suggests the debutant kept well , and @entity25 certainly tested him with a few down the leg side			2
the catch on the leg side that should have been given off @entity78 was an impressive one , too			0
@entity78 , meanwhile , keeps chipping in with wickets and coach @entity81 will be fuming about the way @entity26 gifted @entity0 a wicket either side of tea			1
it ’s as if @entity26 are not sure whether to block @entity78 or try to blast him out of the attack			2
chipping away : @entity78 after @entity88 is caught by @entity23 at the @entity89 safe hands : new boy @entity72 gets ready to catch a skied shot from @entity92 @entity93 was ok in the @entity95 role but that only works if you have a spinner who can contain and attack , and without that you have to ask whether @entity0 have picked their best seamers here			1
@entity101 or @entity102 could have given them more wicket - taking potential			0
@entity20 had a good day , highlighted by him having mid-on and mid-off up to @entity88			0
it would have been easy to drop long - off back but he tempted @entity88 into the shot which got him out and that was promising			0
i would have liked to see a gully employed more often but to have @entity26 323 for eight on a flat pitch was a fine effort from the captain and his senior bowlers .			2

@entity0 *restricted* @entity26 to *328* - 8 on day three of the @entity118
@entity0 *'s* lead bowlers @entity15 , @entity23 were in fine form
@entity25 fared less well but selectors need to keep faith in him
@entity78 continued to chip in with a pair of wickets at the @entity89
