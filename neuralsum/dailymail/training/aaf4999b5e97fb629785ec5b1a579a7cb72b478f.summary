using a robotic arm equipped with a camera , archaeologists have found human bone boxes and an inscription that reads ' @entity5 , raise up , raise up ' in a 1st century christian burial chamber beneath a tower block in @entity8			1
they believe that this is proof the site is the final resting place of @entity13			1
however , other scholars remain highly sceptical of the find			1
the inscription is on a limestone box known as an ossuarie - with another such box carrying a drawing of a fish with a stick figure in its mouth which is believed to refer to the story of @entity25 - one of the very first biblical stories			1
discovery : a fish is carved upon the lid of the 1st century burial tomb which archaeologists believe proves they have located the resting place of @entity13 development : the tower block built above the tomb complex after its discovery in the 1980s the find is 200ft away from an earlier discovery known as the @entity39 , which caused a huge amount of controversy after it was uncovered in the 1980s			1
archaeologists then claimed it contained ossuaries inscribed with names associated with @entity13 's family			1
that discovery sprouted amazing theories including one that maintained @entity13 had been buried there alongside @entity52 who he had married and raised a family with			1
however many leading theologians and archaeologists rubbished such claims as being completely unfounded			1
the @entity39 was only examined briefly before protests by @entity58 , concerned about the disturbance of a grave site , ended the excavation			2
it was then sealed up , and a tower block built over it			2
however @entity63 , a scriptural scholar at the @entity64 at @entity65 and documentary filmmaker @entity66 were determined to continue the research			2
the pair obtained permission from the @entity71 government in 2010 to use the robotic arm to drill holes allowing them to explore the surrounding area			2
this led to the discovery of a separate chamber which they named the ' @entity79 ' , as it sits almost directly below the patio of the building			2
it was inside the @entity84 that they found the inscriptions			2
the pair claim the inscriptions discovered inside the patio tomb greatly increase the likelihood that the ' @entity39 ' is indeed , the resting place of @entity13			1
lettering : the four line inscription in @entity93 has been translated as ' @entity94 , raise up , raise up ' magic moment : the team uses a remote control camera attached to this robotic arm to probe into the burial chamber they argue believe both tombs are part of the same complex which may have been the property of @entity104 , who , according to the gospels , buried @entity13			1
one of the limestone ossuaries carries a @entity93 inscription calling on @entity108 to ' rise up ' or ' raise up ' someone			2
another shows the image of a fish with a stick figure in its mouth which @entity63 has suggested could represent the prophet @entity25			2
mr @entity63 said : ' this inscription has something to do with resurrection of the dead , either of the deceased in the ossuary , or perhaps , given the @entity25 image nearby , an expression of faith in @entity13 ' resurrection			1
belief : dr @entity63 is certain the inscription has something to do with resurrection of the dead in the earliest gospel materials the ' sign of @entity25 , ' as mentioned by @entity13 , has been interpreted as a symbol of his resurrection			1
@entity25 images in later ' early ' christian art , such as images found in the @entity138 catacombs , are the most common motif found on tombs as a symbol of @entity143 resurrection hope			2
in contrast , the story of @entity25 is not depicted in any first century @entity147 art and iconographic images on ossuaries are extremely rare , given the prohibition within @entity151 of making images of people or animals			2
the tomb in question is dated prior to 70 ce , when ossuary use in @entity8 ceased due to the @entity138 destruction of the city			2
if the markings are @entity143 , the engravings represent the earliest archaeological record of @entity143 ever found			0
so the engravings were most likely made by some of @entity13 ' earliest followers , within decades of his death , predating the writing of the gospels			1
' if anyone had claimed to find either a statement about resurrection or a @entity25 image in a @entity147 tomb of this period i would have said impossible -- until now , ' @entity63 said			0
' our team was in a kind of ecstatic disbelief , but the evidence was clearly before our eyes , causing us to revise our prior assumptions			0
' the publication of the academic article is concurrent with the publication of a book by @entity186 entitled ' the @entity187 : the @entity188			0
' a documentary on the discovery will be aired by the @entity191 in spring 2012			0
the findings and their interpretation are likely to be controversial , since most scholars are skeptical of any @entity143 archaeological remains from so early a period			0
adding to the controversy is the tomb 's close proximity to a second tomb , discovered in 1980			0
this tomb , dubbed by some ' the @entity39 , ' contained inscribed ossuaries that some scholars associate with @entity13 and his family , including one that reads ' @entity13 , son of @entity104			1
' @entity206 : one of the bone boxes or ossuaries uncovered after the discovery of the nearby @entity210 in the early 1980s filmmaker @entity66 examines a section of a nearby tomb in 2007 ' context is everything in archaeology , ' @entity63 pointed out			0
' these two tombs , less than 200 feet apart , were part of an ancient estate , likely related to a rich family of the time			1
' we chose to investigate this tomb because of its proximity to the so - called ' @entity13 tomb , ' not knowing if it would yield anything unusual			1
' he added in an interview to @entity228 : ' we have one tomb that has the bones of @entity13 and 200 feet away , people celebrating his resurrection			1
they 're able to put this together in a way that maybe people today have n't considered			0
' the bible tells how on the evening of the crucifixion , @entity104 asked @entity239 for @entity13 ' body			1
@entity241 states that a person hanged on a tree must not be allowed to remain there at night , but should be buried before sundown			1
@entity104 wrapped @entity13 ' body in a linen cloth and laid it in a tomb			1
the book of @entity249 tells how @entity104 was assisted in the burial process by @entity251 , who brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes and included these spices in the burial cloth as per @entity147 customs			0
among the approximately 2000 ossuaries that have been recovered by the @entity258 , only 650 have any inscriptions on them , and none have inscriptions comparable to the team 's finds			0
less than a dozen ossuaries from the period have epitaphs but , according to @entity63 , these inscribed messages usually have to do with warnings not to disturb the bones of the dead			0
in contrast , the four - line @entity93 inscription contains some kind of statement of resurrection faith			0
@entity63 noted that the epitaph 's complete and final translation is uncertain			0
the first three lines are clear , but the last line , consisting of three @entity93 letters , is less sure , yielding several possible translations : ' @entity282 , raise up , raise up , ' or ' the @entity5 raises up to the @entity283 , ' or ' the @entity5 raises up from			0
' ' this inscription has something to do with resurrection of the dead , either of the deceased in the ossuary , or perhaps , given the @entity25 image nearby , an expression of faith in @entity13 ' resurrection , ' @entity63 said			1
the ossuary with the image that @entity63 and his team understand to be representing @entity25 also has other interesting engravings			0
these also may be connected to resurrection , @entity63 notes			0
on one side is the tail of a fish disappearing off the edge of the box , as if it is diving into the water			0
there are small fish images around its border on the front facing , and on the other side is the image of a cross-like gate or entrance â€” which @entity63 interprets as the notion of entering the ' bars ' of death , which are mentioned in the @entity317 in the @entity318			0
other scholars , however , have poured cold water over @entity63 's claims			0
@entity322 , an associate professor of religious studies at @entity324 , told @entity228 that the fish engraving is actually no such thing			0
he said : ' when is a fish not a fish ? when it has handles , matching handles			0
it 's a vase that looks like many of the ones that you 'll find in the early @entity138 period			0
' he added that there is no firm evidence relating to @entity13 in either tomb .			1

adds *weight* to *sensational* theory that @entity13 was buried with @entity52 and had family with her
