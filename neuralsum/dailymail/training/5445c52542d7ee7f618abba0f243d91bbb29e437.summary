according to reports in @entity2 @entity1 have won the race to sign @entity5 midfielder @entity4 , who had also been linked with a move to @entity7			1
news of @entity4 's arrival will delight fans at the @entity11 after he revealed @entity1 were one of his two favourite teams in @entity14 - along with @entity2 rivals @entity15			1
what kind of player is he ? a very modern @entity19 – not a flair player but unflappable in the holding midfield role			1
he can dictate the pace of a game and organize a team			0
he has a great first touch and good awareness			0
and he ’s only 21 so he has plenty of years ahead of him to adjust to @entity28 football			0
he also has a reputation for being level - headed and willing to learn and improve – essential if he ’s to fit in at a big club and learn a new language			0
he was named in the league ’s team of the season at the end of the campaign			2
price ? @entity5 president @entity47 has said he will not negotiate for anything less than £ 12million			2
he also knows there are several clubs interested with @entity1 , @entity51 and @entity7 all keen			1
what ’s his preference ? he has been quoted as saying that his favourite teams in @entity14 are @entity1 and @entity15			2
but that answer may well differ according to who is asking			0
he has also said the @entity28 - based player he models himself on is @entity59			1
after a consistent performances for his club the @entity5 man featured in the @entity64 team of the season modelling himself on @entity68 midfielder @entity67 could be on his way to the @entity70 does he get forward as well as @entity59 ? he only scored three times last season for his club but he did score in the @entity76 @entity75 tournament for @entity36 against @entity77 last may			1
@entity36 went on to beat @entity78 in the final and he was one of the stand - out performers			0
he is not as attacking a player as @entity59 but he does n’t just sit ; he brings the ball out from the back			2
has he played for @entity36 yet ? he has moved up to the @entity84 and will step up to the senior team soon without doubt			0
he will definitely be part of the @entity89 team at @entity90			0
he ’s not the finished product though ? not by any means			0
@entity5 ’s previous coach @entity93 wanted to loan him out for experience and it was only when @entity95 took over as manager that he became first choice			2
so another project for @entity7 if @entity99 lands him then ? @entity1 seem pretty convinced they have him but who knows ? it ’s a long road to the first team at the @entity103			1
@entity99 would certainly be able to offer him first team football sooner so that may persuade him to turn his back on @entity1 and move to @entity106 .			1

according to @entity2 press @entity4 has signed for @entity1
@entity4 had been linked with a move to @entity70 side @entity7
the 21 - year - old @entity19 plays in a holding midfield role for @entity5
