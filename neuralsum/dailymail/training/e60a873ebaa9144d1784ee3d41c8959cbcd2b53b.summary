the names of blue chip companies that used rogue private detectives will finally be revealed next week			1
@entity3 have given police a five - day deadline to release the list of 102 law firms , insurers , financial companies , banks and celebrities			1
if they fail to do so , the names will be published in @entity13 on monday			0
ultimatum : @entity14 , chairman of the home affairs select committee , said he would publish the list of names next week if @entity18 refused to do so the mps are furious that the @entity18 has refused to identify the organisations who were clients of corrupt investigators			1
the move could spark a major row between @entity13 and police , who handed the list to the @entity29 home affairs committee on condition of strict confidence			1
@entity14 , the @entity32 mp who is chairman of the committee , issued the deadline to @entity18 at a stormy meeting yesterday			1
his colleagues warned @entity18 that , by appearing to be protecting the identities of the big businesses on the list , they were giving the impression of ‘ injustice ’			1
it was pointed out to police chiefs that , when journalists had been linked to phone hacking and other illegal practices , police had pursued them relentlessly			0
the logo of the @entity18 which gave the list of names to mps on condition they would not be published but , in the four years since @entity18 discovered that big business and lawyers had – often indirectly – been clients of rogue detectives little or nothing has been done			1
mr @entity14 told @entity58 , @entity18 ’s director general , and @entity60 , the agency ’s interim chairman , that he would publish the list on monday if @entity18 did not do so first			1
‘ the committee has taken the view that this list should be published , ’ he said			2
‘ we would like you to publish the list			2
we see nothing wrong with you publishing the list			0
‘ we know it has gone to the @entity72 and we know they have removed the names that are subject to criminal investigation			0
‘ we give you until monday to publish this list , if you fail to publish it on monday , we will publish it because we think it is in the public interest to do so			2
we ’ve taken legal advice			0
’ the ‘ blue - chip hacking ’ list was drawn up during @entity18 ’s @entity83 , which led to the conviction of four private detectives for fraud last year			1
twenty - two law firms feature alongside several insurance companies , financial services groups and two celebrities			1
up to 100 individuals may have had their details accessed by the private investigators , mr @entity58 previously admitted			1
conservative mp @entity94 asked him yesterday : ‘ the impression is given in some quarters that it ’s alright to pursue journalists for offences or alleged offences but not so when it comes to large city institutions or any other entity that might be of a different nature			0
‘ so is n’t it in the public interest also to avoid those sort of impressions being created , of injustice ? ‘ there is also public interest in not giving the impression that there is an uneven scale of justice applying to different entities			0
‘ we have to protect the wider interests of justice here and that includes that justice be seen to be done as well as actually being done			0
’ the @entity123 mp added : ‘ why should n’t the public know the names ? four rogue private detectives used a range of deception techniques to obtain bank account and mortgage details , medical records and information from the @entity133 ‘ there does n’t seem to me to be any issues of national security or other issues pertaining to the wider national interest			2
’ the mps even suggested @entity18 had not checked whether its board members hold directorships or receive other payments from the 102 firms on the list			1
if any links are confirmed , this could constitute a major conflict of interest , the @entity3 said			0
last night , a @entity18 spokesman said : ‘ we have made our position clear , but in light of the request from the committee we will seek advice and inform the committee of our decision by friday			2
’ @entity159 resulted in the jailing of rogue private detectives @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165			0
the four men used a range of deception techniques to obtain bank account and mortgage details , medical records and information from the @entity133			0
mps said names on the list had begun to leak out – with six firms publicly identified last @entity176 were the accountants , @entity178 , banks @entity180 and @entity181 , and legal firms @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 there is no evidence they knew of any criminal activity			2
@entity178 and @entity185 denied hiring private investigators who acted illegally			1
the other four named companies declined to comment			0
earlier this week , it emerged that – after a four - year delay – the firms on the list are to face an investigation by the @entity197			2
the maximum penalty any of the companies and individuals involved could face if successfully prosecuted for data protection breaches is a fine			0
some would not face any court action , however , because they are based abroad .			0
