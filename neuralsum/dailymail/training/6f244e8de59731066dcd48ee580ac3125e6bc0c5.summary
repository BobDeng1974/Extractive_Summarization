by @entity0 @entity3 2014 has been dealt a serious blow after @entity2 sprint star @entity1 declared himself unavailable for next month ’s @entity5 – even though he ’ll be competing in a @entity7 event at @entity8 just days before the ‘ main event ’			1
with the chances of @entity12 making a rapid recovery in time to compete in the @entity5 also look increasingly slim , according to reports in the @entity16 , the anticipated presence of @entity1 was viewed as a real consolation to sprint fans			2
but the former world champion ’s manager confirmed yesterday that @entity1 , who suffered a series of injuries last season , was going to pick and choose his races this year			0
which means focusing on the big money of the @entity7			0
unavailable : @entity1 wo n't compete in the @entity5 for @entity2 fit : @entity1 competing recently in the 100m at the @entity28 in @entity29 @entity30 suffers shock loss in @entity29 @entity35 , explaining why the 24 - year - old had also missed the @entity2 trials , told local media : ‘ his entire team seriously considered him competing at the trials and @entity5 , it was something that we were looking at for a long time			1
‘ but , in the end , the team decided that they would do what ’s in the best interest of the athlete			0
' he ’s healthy , you saw how he has looked since coming back , but he is looking forward to the next three years , so this year is about getting him back in the saddle and getting him back to running really fast again			0
‘ we only have about seven to eight races scheduled for him this year , although he is ready and able to run very fast like he did in @entity51 at the @entity52			0
’ the nature of @entity1 ’s withdrawal is likely to infuriate @entity3 2014 officials and fans who bought tickets expecting to see the @entity5 ’s best compete for gold because he remains committed the lucrative @entity7 circuit			1
as well as running in the @entity3 @entity28 at the @entity5 venue of @entity8 on july 11 - 12 , @entity1 is also pledged to compete at the @entity61 on july 20 , three days before the opening ceremony in @entity3			1
cohorts : @entity12 celebrates with team - mate @entity1 following the 200 - metre final during @entity65 fast men : the two pose on the track after their relay victory at the same event the news of @entity1 ’s decision will come as a major hammer blow to the credibility of the @entity5 , despite the guaranteed presence of world and @entity78 champions across a range of track and field events – most notably middle distance legend @entity81 , world record holder over 800 metres			1
equally worrying for @entity84 will be the fact that @entity1 ’s decision came after discussions with @entity87 , the coach he shares with @entity12 ; the fastest man on earth also misses the @entity2 trials and reports in the @entity16 suggest he remains a long shot – at best – to compete in the @entity5			2
both sprinters missed last friday ’s registration deadline but organisers hoped @entity12 would claim a medical exemption , allowing him to skip the trials but still compete			0
sources close to the @entity12 camp , though , suggest that he is extremely unlikely to line up in @entity3 .			2

@entity1 has declared himself unavailable for @entity5
but he will be competing at @entity7 in @entity3 just days earlier
move is a blow to the credibility of the games with his @entity2 team - mate @entity12 also unlikely to compete
