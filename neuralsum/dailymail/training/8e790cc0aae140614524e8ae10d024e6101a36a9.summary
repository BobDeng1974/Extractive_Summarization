by @entity1 reporter published : 07:12 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 07:12 est , 9 march 2013 after nearly eighty years behind the wheel , @entity2 is not only still driving but doing it in style after forking out on a brand new set of wheels			1
the 94 - year - old first got behind the wheel aged 15 in 1934 when @entity11 was on the throne , the first @entity9 film was made and @entity14 bank robbers @entity15 were killed			1
almost eight decades on , the mother - of - three is still going strong and has just purchased a new @entity17			2
she may be 94 , but @entity2 from @entity18 has got no intention of giving up driving and has bought a new car to mark nearly 80 years behind the wheel in her long and distinguished driving career mrs @entity2 has managed an almost perfect record			1
she 's chalked up just one speeding fine and has never been involved in an accident despite clocking up tens of thousands of miles			0
mrs @entity2 still vividly remembers the day , during a holiday in @entity29 , when her motor engineer father persuaded her to take the controls of the family 's @entity32			1
' he was a keen motorist and he just wanted me to get started , ' said mrs @entity2 , from @entity36 , @entity18			1
' there was a complete lack of traffic and the roads were beautifully cambered			0
@entity2 in her younger days			2
she began driving in 1934 when @entity11 was still on the throne ' i remember feeling very excited and can still remember the registration - @entity43 999			1
it always made me think of spending a penny urgently ! ' mrs @entity2 has fond memories of picnics and outings in the tourer from the family home near @entity51 , @entity52 , to the @entity53 and @entity54			2

but she remembers it did not go without drama			0
while trying to reverse up a steep hill , the clutch became very hot and she had to abandon the attempt			0
sprightly @entity2 , who has only ever had a single speeding fine , does n't rule out still driving when she is 100 ' it was the car 's fault , not mine , so the examiner passed me - plus he was a friend of my father			1
' her one brush with the law came when she was in her 80s and was driving to @entity80 to visit one of her children			2
