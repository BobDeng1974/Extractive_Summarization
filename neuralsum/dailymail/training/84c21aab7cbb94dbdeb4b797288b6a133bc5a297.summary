by @entity1 reporter published : 16:23 est , 26 november 2012 updated : 16:25 est , 26 november 2012 @entity2 , 57 , who bled to death at his home in @entity5 just days after undergoing surgery for throat cancer a grandfather who bled to death just days after undergoing surgery for throat cancer was not warned of the dangers of the treatment , an inquest has heard			1
@entity2 , 57 , a learning disabilities nurse , suffered from catastrophic bleeding and drowned in his own blood following transoral laser surgery to remove a tumour in his throat			1
a leading doctor told an inquest that any future patients considering the surgery would be warned of the danger of bleeding to death afterwards			1
his grieving family have questioned how doctors were unaware about the risk previously			2
his daughter @entity28 , 26 , a nurse , said : ' it was positive to hear that doctors are already looking to make changes , but my only concern is how nobody seemed to know about this risk of death before			1
' why had nobody looked into it ? why did it take my dad to die for these changes to be made ? ' the inquest heard that mr @entity2 had a 5cm by 4cm ulcer at the left side base of his tongue , where his throat tumour had been removed , which had ' eroded ' a branch of the carotid artery , causing catastrophic bleeding			1
leading an inquest into the death , @entity50 said he had not heard any evidence to suggest the transoral laser surgery mr @entity2 had five days before was not properly carried out			1
but rejecting the conclusions of a post mortem examination , which said the death was due to ' natural causes ' , he said the operation , and an ulcer it caused , were ' inextricably linked ' to what happened			1
mr @entity50 ruled that mr @entity2 , from @entity5 , died as the result of the ' unexpected consequences of a necessary operation			1
' surgeon @entity65 told the inquest that since mr @entity2 's death he had spoken to colleagues around the @entity69 about what happened , and discovered patients in @entity72 and @entity73 had suffered the same fate			1
he said he now tells all patients set to undergo transoral laser surgery that there is a chance they could bleed to death afterwards			2
but mr @entity2 's grieving family have now questioned why he had to die before medics could recognise the dangers of the surgery - six years after doctors in @entity85 highlighted the risks			1
the family point to articles written by cancer doctors in @entity92 , @entity85 , as long ago as 2006 in which they warned that severe bleeding could occur up to a fortnight later			1
mr @entity2 first felt a lump in his throat around @entity96 last year and went to see his gp			1
sisters @entity99 , left , and @entity100 , right , who have questioned why their father had to die before changes were made in which doctors now tell patients about the risk of bleeding to death following transoral laser surgery after initially being told it was probably just a swollen gland , he was eventually referred for further investigations , first at @entity111 in @entity5 , then the @entity112 in @entity113 and eventually @entity114			1
in february , he was diagnosed with cancer and underwent a neck dissection to remove the lump , which was seen as a success , and offered either chemotherapy and radiotherapy or transoral laser surgery to try and remove any remaining cancer			2
@entity28 added : ' he decided to go with the transoral because the people he 'd spoken to having radio and chemo were quite poorly , and he went in for it on april 4 , four days after his 57th birthday			2
' when he was discharged on april 8 , which was a sunday , my uncle noticed he was coughing in the car on the way home			2
' he went to bed because he was quite tired , then got up and drove mum to work the next day			2
' my sister @entity136 came home in the afternoon and a friend was there who had popped to see him			2
' she could see his neck was really swollen , like he had tonsillitis , but at the time he did n't think anything of it			0
' he started to cough , so my sister told him to go to the kitchen if he was going to bring up phlegm			0
' he coughed up a massive clot of blood and started to gush like a fountain			0
@entity113 's @entity149 where mr @entity2 was pronounced dead following severe bleeding from the mouth ' he was hysterical and ran out into the garden , panicking and scared , saying " i 'm going to die " and " @entity153 "			1
' an ambulance was called , but by the time paramedics arrived @entity2 's heart had already stopped			1
he was taken to @entity113 's @entity149 where he was pronounced dead			0
@entity28 said : ' there was no dignity in his death			0
he knew he was dying and had to stand and watch it happening			0
' i ca n't imagine what it must have been like			0
' my mum @entity164 could n't even go to the funeral because she was so traumatised by what happened			0
' we had to stay with her for a fortnight because we were so worried			0
she did n't eat for about three weeks			0
' when she turned 50 last month she said she did n't want a thing , not even a card			0
she did n't want to know because to her it just meant that she 's got another 30 years without dad			0
' mr @entity65 told the inquest that there was nothing the family could have done to save @entity2 once the bleed started			1
he said : ' if he had been in hospital , in close proximity to a head and neck surgeon - as nobody else would have been able to do it , not a nurse or a junior doctor - then possibly			1
' even then the chance would have been very slim			0
' @entity28 said she felt like she was ' living in hell ' since the keen golfer , a member of @entity190 , died and that his death had been particularly hard for her young son , @entity192			2
she said : ' they were very close			0
' @entity194 always wanted a boy and when i had @entity192 he doted on him			0
he 's only four and now he 's going to grow up without his grandad			0
' i 've tried to work out what went wrong , but ca n't and it makes me really furious			0
' it was less that 24 hours from him leaving the hospital to his death			0
