a former vice cop who now works as a full - time pastor will star in a new reality show that aims at getting women off the street			1
8 minutes will center around pastor @entity5 and his work trying to get prostitutes and escorts in the @entity10 area to give up their work and go straight			1
and though the show is not set to air until next year , @entity5 has been doing this work for years now			1
' @entity5 told his congregation that for 20 years he ’s had to arrest these women when what he ’s really wanted to do is help them			1
it launched a drive within his church to run these undercover operations			0
we read that and thought somebody should put a camera on this			0
' @entity5 works to target woman he feels have been forced into the business , something he is good at after all his years working in vice			2
he then meets them in a room pretending to be a client , and offers them the chance to quit , providing the assistance they would need to leave the lifestyle			0
the show will follow these interactions , as well as life after for women that have chosen to leave			0
' women have burst into tears and said , “ i ’ve been waiting for someone to offer me a path out , ” ' said @entity25			2
' and you have women who say , “ i ’m doing what i ’m doing and i ’m not doing anything else , ” and they decline			0
' way out : even the women who refuse his help get a number to call should they change their mind as for the eight minutes , that is a safety protocol for the girls , this way if they decline they can go back to their pimps , should they have one , and just claim @entity5 was a cop without causing any problems			2
if they do not accept his help , @entity5 does still leave the women with a phone number to contact him later			0
in addition to @entity5 , the show will also have safety lookouts to make sure nothing turns violent and former prostitutes who the @entity5 previously saved from the lifestyle to talk to the girls			1
