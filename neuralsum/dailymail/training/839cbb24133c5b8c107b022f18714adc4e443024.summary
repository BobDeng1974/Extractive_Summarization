scientists have discovered the gene that protects young and middle - aged adults from strokes			0
people with a specific variant of a gene , known as @entity7 , have a lower risk of suffering a cervical artery dissection - one of the most common causes of strokes in those under the age of 50			1
a cervical artery dissection is a tear in the artery in the nec , that leads to the brain			1
the tear can lead to blood clots developing , which can restrict the blood supply to the brain and cause a stroke			1
people with a variant of the gene known as @entity7 are at reduced risk of suffering a cervical artery dissection , a tear in an artery in the neck that leads to the brain			1
cervical artery dissection is one of the most common causes of stroke in people under 50 the same gene variant has also been identified as a protector against migraines and affects the risk of heart attack			1
scientists hope the breakthrough will herald new treatments and strategies to stop strokes in young people			0
approximately 15 million people worldwide suffer a stroke each year			2
in the @entity51 152,000 people a year suffer a stroke			2
it is the third largest cause of death after heart disease and cancer			0
brain injuries caused by strokes are a major cause of adult disability in the @entity51 , with a quarter of these people aged under 65			2
cervical artery dissection is a tear in the lining in one of the arteries in the neck			1
this can make a person more likely to develop blood clots , which can restrict the blood supply to the brain and lead to a stroke			2
blood clots can then become stuck in the tear in the artery wall , or they can break off and travel to the brain			2
when the blood flow to the brain is disrupted , it can become starved of oxygen and nutrients			2
this damages brain cells and they begin to die			0
the brain controls everything the body does , including movement , speech , vision and emotions			0

source : @entity101 professor of clinical neurology @entity103 , of @entity105 , said : ' this is an important breakthrough			0
' the findings provide scientists with a greater understanding of how this gene appears to influence key functions , he added			0
he continued : ' this could have major implications for the treatment of these severe and disabling conditions			0
' the study was the largest of its kind and involved researchers from around the world screening the entire genome of 1,400 patients with cervical artery dissection			1
another 14,400 people without the disease were also studied			0
cervical artery dissection can lead to the adjacent nerves in the neck being compressed			1
this can lead to blood clotting , which potentially causes blockages , which lead to strokes or even brain damage if the clots travel to the brain			1
professor @entity103 added : ' further genetic analyses and worldwide collaborations of this kind provide hope of pinpointing the underlying mechanisms that cause stroke			0
' the bio-repository of @entity142 in @entity143 ( brains ) study i am leading is creating a large stroke dna biobank which will give an exciting opportunity to identify the genes directly linked to the condition			0
' the study published in the journal @entity152			0
cervical artery dissection is a tear in the lining in one of the arteries in the neck ( pictured in red )			1
this can make a person more likely to develop blood clots , which can restrict the blood supply to the brain and lead to a stroke , or even brain damage if the clots travel to the brain			1

people with a variant of gene @entity7 have a reduced risk of stroke
they have a reduced risk of suffering a cervical artery dissection
cervical artery dissection is a leading cause of stroke in people under 50
it is a tear in the artery in the neck which can lead to blood clotting
clots can cause blockages , which can lead to a stroke or brain damage
