by @entity1 reporter published : 10:36 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 13:06 est , 14 october 2013 squeeze : @entity3 recipients face historic low increases as @entity5 struggles to balance its books millions of @entity7 are facing the second year of near record low social security rises			1
more than one - fifth of the country are bracing themselves for a 1.5 per cent increase - one of the smallest since 1975 , according to an analysis by @entity12			1
since then , when annual rises , called the cost - of - living - adjustment ( @entity16 ) , were introduced , @entity3 increases have averaged 4.1 per cent			1
nearly 58 million , including disabled veterans , retirees , handicapped workers , spouses and children , will be affected by the historic lows			1
the average monthly payment is $ 1,162			1
a 1.5 per cent raise would increase the typical monthly payment by about $ 17			1
the cola also affects benefits for more than three million disabled veterans , about two and a half million federal retirees and their survivors , and more than eight million people who get @entity31 , the disability program for the poor			2
the exact @entity16 report will not be known until the @entity35 releases the inflation report for september which has been delayed due to the partial government shutdown			1
automatic colas were adopted so that benefits for people on fixed incomes would keep up with rising prices			1
lower prices for gasoline is one of the factors helping to contribute to holding down inflation , according to experts			1
but some experts fear the measure used to calculate @entity3 payments is not keeping pace with the rise in the cost of living			1
@entity55 of @entity56 , @entity57 , told @entity12 he can handle one small cola but several in a row make it hard to plan for unexpected expenses			0
' i 'm not one of those folks that 's going to fall into poverty , but it is going to make a difference in my standard of living as time goes by , ' said @entity55 , 83 , who retired from the @entity71			0
' i live in a small apartment and i have an old car , and it 's going to break down			0
and no doubt when it does , i 'll have to fix it or get a new one			0
' only six times have they been less than two percent , including this year , when the increase was 1.7 percent			0
there was no cola in 2010 or 2011 because inflation was too low			2
by law , the cost - of - living adjustment is based on the @entity85 , or @entity86 , a broad measure of consumer prices generated by the @entity88			1
it measures price changes for food , housing , clothing , transportation , energy , medical care , recreation and education			0
the cola is calculated by comparing consumer prices in july , august and september each year to prices in the same three months from the previous year			0
if prices go up over the course of the year , benefits go up , starting with payments delivered in january			0
cost of living : experts fear @entity3 payments are not keeping pace with the rising cost of living , such as food prices ( file photo ) this year , average prices for july and august were 1.4 percent higher than they were a year ago , according to the @entity114 - @entity113 once the september report , the final piece of the puzzle , is released , the cola can be announced officially			1
if prices continued to slowly inch up in september , that would put the cola at roughly 1.5 percent			2
several economists said there were no dramatic price swings in september to significantly increase or decrease the projected cola			2
that means the projection should not change by more than a few tenths of a percentage point , if at all			0
@entity128 , a research fellow at the @entity129 , projects the cola will be between 1.4 percent and 1.6 percent			0
the exact @entity16 figure has been delayed due to the partial shutdown of @entity5 her projection is similar to those done by others , including @entity135 , which estimates the cola will be between 1.5 percent and 1.7 percent			1
the senior citizens league estimates it will be about 1.5 percent			0
lower prices for gasoline are helping to fuel low inflation , @entity128 said			1
' in years with high cola 's , a lot of that had to do with fuel prices and in some cases food prices			2
neither of those increased much this year , ' @entity128 said			0
' so that kept the lid on the overall increase in prices			2
' gasoline prices are down 2.4 percent from a year ago while food prices are up slightly , according to the august inflation report			1
housing costs went up 2.3 percent and utilities increased by 3.2 percent			0
advocates for seniors say the government 's measure of inflation does n't accurately reflect price increases older @entity7 face because they tend to spend more of their income on health care			1
medical costs went up less than in previous years but still outpaced other consumer prices , rising 2.5 percent			2
' this ( @entity16 ) is not enough to keep up with inflation , as it affects seniors , ' said @entity166 , who heads the @entity167			0
' there are some things that become cheaper but they are not things that seniors buy			0
laptop computers have gone down dramatically but how many people at 70 are buying laptop computers ? ' the cost of personal computers dropped by 10.6 percent over the past year , according the @entity114 - @entity113 that 's a small consolation to @entity179 of the @entity180 , who said she is concerned about keeping up with her household bills			2
' it is very important to get the cola because everything else you have in your life is on an upward swing , and if you 're on a downward swing , that means your quality of life is going down , ' said @entity179 , who retired from the @entity192 in 1989 .			0
