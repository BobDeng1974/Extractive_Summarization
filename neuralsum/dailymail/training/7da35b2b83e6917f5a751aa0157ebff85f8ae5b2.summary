by @entity1 reporter published : 16:29 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 09:58 est , 6 june 2013 the major @entity3 intimate apparel manufacturer , @entity4 , recently announced it is getting rid of a / b / c / @entity6 cups altogether			0
instead , @entity4 's new @entity7 measures the volume of a woman 's breast - with sizes running from 1 through 10 - as well as their under - bust measurement to create a ' near - custom ' fit			1
but for $ 60 per bra , and $ 19.95 for the try - at - home kit available online , skeptical customers have had reservations about the new system			1
so @entity1 took @entity4 's volumetric sizing kit for a test drive , to see just how well it shaped up			0
good fit : @entity4 's new @entity22 comes with 10 plastic cups , a measuring tape and instructions on how to find your perfect bra size using @entity4 's flexible plastic measuring ' cups ' in varying shapes , we tried each one on for size to see what worked best - with the least amount of gapping spillage			1
@entity36 came measuring under the bust , using the color - coded , and double - sided ( for mirror reflection ease ) measuring band			0
there are seven different band sizes to choose from - 30 , 32 , 34 , 36 , 38 , 40 or 42			2
however i measured 31 , and am still not quite sure where that leaves me			0
patented : the @entity45 ( left ) and the @entity46 ( right ) , $ 60 each , are two options in @entity4 's new @entity49 range and have a patented @entity51 contour design that does away with underwires soft support : the @entity54 ( left ) and the @entity55 ( right ) have ' unique @entity56 for a revolutionary soft cup ' that has no underwire , but gives firm support to give customers piece of mind , however , @entity4 offers a love at @entity64 guarantee promise - or your money back			2
and while the @entity22 costs $ 19.95 from @entity69 , this amount is actually redeemable as a $ 19.95 discount off the price of your first bra			1
' it ’s always a risk when you change something that ’s been in the market for a very long time , but not only are we changing the fit , we ’re changing the whole product , ' explained			0
@entity4 's senior vice president , @entity82			0
@entity84 measuring : jockey 's new bra fitting system enables women to measure themselves at home to find their perfect fit using 10 different - sized plastic cups ' it took us eight years to develop the new @entity4 bra and its revolutionary @entity7 , ' said @entity82 , @entity4 's senior vice president of design , research and development			1
' through our research , and countless hours of testing and talking with women , we are confident we are answering women 's desire for the perfect - fitting bra			2
' current standard cup sizes are based on two measurements - the breast at its fullest point , minus the rib cage measurement			1
a one - inch difference equates to an a cup ; a two - inch difference , a b cup , and so on			0
price point : the @entity7 costs $ 19.95 from @entity69 , which redeemable as a $ 19.95 discount off the price of your first bra @entity4 says this 80 - year - old equation does n’t account for volume and different breast shapes			1
the bra itself ( @entity1 was sent the @entity46 to try in a size 2 - 32 ) is padded and extremely soft , giving full coverage ; but we do have some reservations			2
although @entity126 has replaced traditional bra underwires with ' @entity51 contour support , ' the hard material feels much like the underwire of my usual bra , anyway			0
and after using the cup fitting system - determining my bra size as 3 - the size 2 sample bra felt gappy , rather than too small			1
which lead to some measurement confusion			0
bra shopping is notoriously traumatic , with research showing 75per cent of women have trouble finding a bra that fits properly , and a staggering 85per cent of women are wearing the wrong sized bra			0
while @entity1 appreciated the ease of a ' buy online and try - at - home ' service , we felt we still needed guidance as to whether our measuring techniques were correct			2
according to research on @entity4 's website , 53per cent of women have never been professionally fitted for a bra - and diy fitting , despite @entity4 's sophisticated fitting system , is still no ' professional ' fit			1
finding a ' true ' bra size is never as ' simple ' as a simple two - step process			0
while innovative , the @entity7 is still best tried within the supportive confines of a jockey store .			1

jockey spent eight years developing @entity7 based on breast volume
the self - measurement kit costs $ 19.95 and can be purchased online
there are five different bra styles to choose from , all of them wire - free
jockey *claims* its new system is the closest thing to made - to - measure
