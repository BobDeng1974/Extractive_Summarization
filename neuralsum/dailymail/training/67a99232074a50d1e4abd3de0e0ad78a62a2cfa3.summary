by @entity0 and @entity1 a @entity3 schoolteacher who claims she was fired by a nothern @entity5 diocese for trying to get pregnant through in vitro fertlization , will have her day in court			1
@entity8 district judge @entity7 ruled this week that former @entity10 school teacher @entity9 deserves a chance to prove that she was terminated by the @entity12 based on sex discrimination			1
this issue ' is whether mrs. @entity9 was nonrenewed because of her sex , or because of a sincere belief ( by the diocese ) about the morality of in vitro fertilization , ' @entity14 wrote in the 29 - page ruling issued wednesday @entity9 ( left ) claims she was fired as a teacher from a catholic school in 2011 , for undergoing in vitro fertility treatments to get pregnant with her husband @entity24 ( right )			1
a district court judge ruled this week that the case can go to trial @entity9 , of @entity28 , @entity5 , sued the diocese in april 2012 , alleging that her firing by the diocese violated the @entity32 and the @entity8 with @entity33 by discriminating against her based on gender and on infertility , which is considered a disability			1
the 34 - year - old taught literature and language arts at the school from 2003 - 2011			0
bishop @entity40 allegedly told @entity9 that the fertility treatment was ' an intrinsic evil ' @entity9 spoke about her firing when she first filed the lawsuit			2
appearing on the @entity46 , @entity9 and her husband recalled how they were first encouraged to try in vitro when after their first child was born , doctors told @entity9 she would n't be able to get pregnant naturally again			2
she says she was straightforward with her employers , telling the school 's principal that she was going to try in vitro and would need time off for the treatments			0
he allegedly granted the time off and said : ' you are in my prayers '			0
but when she asked for more time off in may 2011 , for a second round of in vitro , @entity9 was told to report to msgr @entity62 , the pastor of the @entity63			2
according to court documents , @entity64 called @entity9 a ' grave , immoral sinner ' and that if news of the @entity70 treatments got out , it would cause a ' scandal ' for the church			1
the @entity3 has long disapproved of these fertility treatments because additional embryos are created to increase the chances of pregnancy , and are sometimes destroyed when one egg takes			0
@entity9 then appealed to bishop @entity40 , assuring him that no embryos were destroyed in her individual treatment			2
but that meeting was just as negative , with @entity81 saying : ' the process of in vitro fertilization very frequently involves the deliberate destruction or freezing of human embryos			0
' in vitro fertilization ... is an intrinsic evil , which means that no circumstances can justify it			0
' in his decision this week , @entity14 denied @entity9 's claim that she was fired for her infertility , rather than the treatment itself , which is banned under catholic doctrine			1
' the @entity97 appears to be exactly right : all the evidence in the record indicates that the @entity97 acted because of mrs. @entity9 's choice of fertility treatment and not on any animus against infertility , ' he wrote			2
part of @entity9 's complaint on the sex discrimination issue was that men play a different role in the procedure and if it is successful , they do n't become pregnant , said @entity112 , one of the attorneys who represented @entity9			1
@entity9 taught literature and language arts at the @entity116 ( pictured ) from 2003 to 2011 the diocese has argued that the policy against in vitro fertilization treats men and women the same			1
but @entity14 said a jury might not accept that argument			0
' the @entity97 has n't terminated any men for participation in this ( or any other ) infertility treatment , ' he noted			0
also in the ruling , @entity14 spurned the diocese 's argument that , as a religious organization , it is protected from @entity9 's claims			1
religious employers are not immune to federal laws against sex discrimination , he wrote			0
@entity14 also disagreed with the diocese 's claim that @entity9 was a lay ' minister ' in the church , and therefore her termination was protected by the federal ministerial exception , which gives religious organizations leeway in the treatment of their ministers			2
' nothing in the summary judgment record suggests that mrs. @entity9 was a member of the clergy of the @entity3 , ' he wrote , adding that she was considered by the principal to be a ' lay teacher			1
' @entity112 said if @entity9 prevails at trial on the sex discrimination claim , she can still receive the damages she seeks , such as back pay , even though the judge dismissed her disability claim			1
the @entity1 left a phone message friday seeking comment from the diocese 's attorney			0
in vitro fertilization , or @entity70 , involves mixing egg and sperm in a laboratory dish and transferring a resulting embryo into the womb			0
the couple talked about @entity9 's firing when they first filed a lawsuit against the diocese in april 2012 , appearing on the @entity46			0

@entity9 , 34 , claims she was fired from her position as a teacher at the @entity116 for undergoing @entity70
a district court judge has now approved the case to go to trial
if she wins the discrimination case , she could win damages such as back pay
