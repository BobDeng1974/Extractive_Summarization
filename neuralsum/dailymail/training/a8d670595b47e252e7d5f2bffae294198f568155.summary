by @entity0 and @entity1 people who want to see @entity4 jailed for the @entity5 have their ‘ heart in the right place ’ , @entity2 said today			2
but the @entity9 mayor warned it would be ‘ very difficult ’ to convict the former prime minister because he is ‘ a very eel - like customer ’			2
the senior @entity13 spoke out as it emerged the bill for the long - delayed report on the 2003 conflict is on course to hit £ 10million			1
@entity4 , pictured answering questions in 2010 , has been accused of trying to delay publication of the @entity21 there is growing pressure for the @entity21 to publish its report , almost five years since it was announced by the last @entity26 government			1
@entity27 wants it to be released as soon as possible , with mr @entity4 denying he is responsible for the hold - up			0
today mr @entity2 said that he had come to view the entire case for the move to topple @entity32 as ‘ nonsense ’ and had sympathy for those who want mr @entity4 to face the law			1
taking calls on @entity38 , he said : ‘ i ’d like to see the report published			1
there will be plenty of arguments you can make about bringing all kinds of people to justice			0
@entity9 mayor @entity2 said it would be difficult to convict mr @entity4 for war crimes ‘ i happen to think that in the case of @entity4 , it will be quite difficult to secure a conviction			1
he is a very eel like customer			0
i think it would be very unlikely that you ’d get him			0
’ he later added : ‘ i mean , you can have some very nice eels			0
i do n’t want to be rude to the former prime minister , you can have some ; i felt guilty as soon as i said that			0
‘ he can be , you know , he ’s a very , very adept and agile lawyer and i think that … our caller who thought that he was going to be imprisoned for what he did in @entity67 , his heart is in the right place			0
’ mr @entity2 added : ‘ i just think there will undoubtedly be people who continue to try to bring @entity4 to justice in one way or another			0
i think it unlikely that they will succeed in that respect			0
’ sir @entity76 ’s investigation into the 2003 conflict last took evidence from a witness three years ago but the report has yet to be published			1
it was claimed today that a row over the publication of conversations between former prime minister @entity4 and ex @entity86 president @entity85 is behind the delay			1
the @entity88 reported that the row over publication of the pair 's letters and meetings could mean the cost to the taxpayer rises to around £ 10million			1
@entity96 sources say the process of declassifying documents , including mr @entity4 ’s correspondence with the then president , remains stalled			0
it is thought that no one involved has so far received a letter from the inquiry as part of the so - called ‘ @entity111 ’ process – the legal requirement to notify individuals who are criticised in a government - commissioned report			2
@entity96 sources have also suggested that with an election due in may 2015 , it will be deemed too politically difficult to publish it until after voters have gone to the polls			1
one of the main bones of contention over the report into the conflict ( pictured ) is private notes between @entity4 and the then @entity86 president @entity85 one source has said : ‘ it ’s certainly not going to be ready before the end of the year and it would be a highly political act to publish in the months before an election			1
the can is going to be kicked further down the road			0
’ @entity26 strategists are said to be alarmed at the prospect of voters being reminded of the @entity67 war in the months before the election , since the conflict was blamed for driving many of its voters to the @entity137 in 2005 and 2010			1
the delays and the spiraling bill has added to the anger felt by families of soldiers killed in the conflict , it claims			1
@entity145 , from the @entity146 told the @entity88 that members of her organisation feel mr @entity4 is ' laughing at them '			2
it is said the delays to the report by sir @entity76 ( right ) have been caused by a row over letters between @entity85 ( left ) and @entity4 current prime minister @entity27 waded into the row this week when he called for the report to be made public as quickly as possible a no 10 aide said : ‘ the @entity27 believes there is no excuse for any further lengthy delay in publishing @entity76			1
it would be unreasonable to postpone it beyond the next election			2
’ a cabinet office spokesperson said last night : ' the @entity21 has had full unfettered access to all government papers			2
' @entity164 has been in a constructive dialogue with the inquiry team over recent months , with a clear view to meeting their declassification requests			0
' this has involved several thousand documents , subject only to ensuring that national security and foreign policy objectives are not compromised as provided for in the protocol agreed at the outset of the @entity176			0
that process should be concluded shortly			0

@entity179 says he now views the case for 2003 conflict as ' nonsense '
delays to publication of @entity21 said to be over *ex-leaders* ' letters
it is claimed the bill for the investigation could now top eight figures
report may not be published until after next election due to political issues
familes of soldiers killed in the war say they feel they are being ' laughed at '
