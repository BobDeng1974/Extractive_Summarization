@entity1 stars slammed the substitution of @entity3 during a fiery dressing - room inquest after their shocking 5 - 3 defeat at @entity6			1
@entity7 , who had scored an early contender for @entity10 goal of the season to put @entity1 2 - 0 up , was substituted when the score was 3 - 3			1
during scenes described by one source at the @entity16 as ‘ very heated ’ , a @entity1 player was heard to say : ‘ why the f * * * did we substitute @entity7 ? ’ @entity3 is substituted by @entity19 with @entity1 level at 3 - 3 against @entity6 @entity7 ( back row , centre ) sits on the bench and watches @entity1 capitulate , eventually losing 5 - 3 @entity24 brought on @entity25 ( back row , centre ) to replace @entity7 with less than 15 minutes remaining the @entity29 forward was @entity1 ’s obvious match winner after his stunning performance against @entity32 the previous week			1
but under - fire manager @entity19 , who has won just one game since he took over , withdrew the £ 60million signing from @entity35 in the 76th minute			2
@entity6 were clearly lifted when @entity7 was replaced by @entity25 and scored twice to seal a remarkable victory			1
@entity24 openly condemned his team in the dressing room following their humiliating defeat and @entity40 was also criticised by a number of players for his part in the implosion			0
the @entity46 defender gave away a 62nd - minute penalty that allowed @entity6 to claw their way back into the game			1
@entity1 left the stadium in such a hurry that they suffered abuse from @entity6 fans when their team bus was stuck in traffic near the stadium			1
@entity7 had earlier scored a stunning goal to put @entity1 2 - 0 up and seemingly cruising against @entity6 @entity7 celebrates his brilliant chip but his smile would soon disappear as @entity1 threw away the three points @entity1 will not rush to sign a new centre back in january despite their alarming defensive frailties at @entity6			1
the shocking manner of their collapse underlined a lack of leadership and organisation and prompted the furious reaction from @entity24			0
their problems were compounded by an ankle injury to @entity71 , their most experienced defender			0
@entity1 spent £ 156million in the summer but only £ 16m on a centre back , @entity74 , who now plays predominantly at left back			1
the recruitment plan has been branded ‘ mismanagement ’ by @entity78 ’s @entity77 while former @entity1 defender @entity79 said that the side now have a soft centre that all @entity10 sides will attack			1
though @entity1 recognise there is an issue , the central defenders who are available are not deemed of good enough quality			2
@entity40 was adjudged to have fouled @entity88 in the area to hand @entity6 a way back into the game @entity92 fired home the penalty to reduce the @entity96 ' arrears and enable them to launch a comeback @entity98 levelled the game at 3 - 3 with a fine strike as @entity1 's defence fell apart at the seams @entity88 kept his cool to fire the ball home and put @entity6 in front for the first time in the game @entity107 made sure of the three points with a penalty that left keeper @entity110 with no chance @entity24 spoke openly about the need to address the departures of @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 if only more for their experience than performances			1
yet the club had been told that @entity123 captain @entity122 was not for sale , @entity120 had already captured @entity127 ’s @entity125 and @entity126 would only deal on @entity128 if @entity129 was sent the other way			0
@entity123 ’s stance on @entity122 is unlikely to change until the summer while @entity1 have reservations about the likes of @entity134 at @entity135 and @entity136 at @entity137			2
@entity1 are interested in signing @entity138 winner @entity122 from @entity123 @entity24 was clear from early august that his priority should be a left - sided centre back with an ability to bring the ball out of defence			1
he was alarmed that @entity1 ’s defenders seemed incapable of starting attacks from defence with any real assurance			2
@entity74 , who played for @entity29 in the @entity138 final , is highly regarded by @entity24 and will get his chance at centre back against @entity151 on saturday with @entity71 out , @entity147 injured and @entity152 suspended			2
@entity24 said : ‘ i think that @entity153 shall be fit enough to play			0
@entity74 can play and @entity129 can play , so we can manage			0
but it ’s a thin choice			0
’ @entity74 can play at both left back and centre back but has yet to find a settled position in @entity1 's defence @entity153 has yet to convince @entity24 that he is ready to be a regular starter under him at @entity1 @entity24 will meet with executive vice-chairman @entity161 this week , as he does most weeks , and discuss his squad ’s progress			1
he says the whole team is responsible for results such as sunday ’s defeat and not just the defence			2
@entity24 has also indicated that @entity169 ’s future lies in midfield			0
explaining his selection for @entity6 in which @entity173 started and @entity25 dropped to the bench , he said : ‘ i was not so satisfied with @entity169 as a striker and @entity25 as midfielder			1
that is why i changed			0
@entity169 can play in more positions , he ’s a multi-functional player			0
’ @entity169 , talking to @entity179 , said : ‘ i do n’t think anyone can put a finger on my best position , but i am adaptable			0
i can go into midfield , drop out wide or play up front			0
it depends on where the manager wants me to play			0

video pleased with comeback - @entity190			0

@entity3 was replaced with @entity1 level at 3 - 3
@entity25 came off the bench but @entity1 went on to lose 5 - 3 to @entity6
a @entity1 player said afterwards : ' why the f * * * did we substitute @entity7 ? '
the @entity200 had earlier scored a brilliant goal to make it 2 - 0
@entity1 spent £ 156million in the summer but only £ 16m on a centre back
the @entity207 side have looked *vulnerable* in defence this season
