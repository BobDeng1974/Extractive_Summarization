@entity0 was personally assured the @entity2 mainline deal was secure , weeks before the government ’s humiliating admission that the franchise competition was riddled with ‘ unacceptable mistakes ’			1
the prime minister intervened after a public appeal by @entity9 ’ sir @entity10 , who faced losing the lucrative contract to rivals @entity12			1
but there are growing questions about why it was not until days before a @entity17 challenge that civil servants realised their computer models were wrong			1
furious : @entity0 was assured by the @entity21 that the decision to strip @entity9 of the @entity2 franchise was sound in august mr @entity0 asked for checks to be made on the winning bid and officials at the @entity21 insisted the £ 13bn @entity12 bid was sound			1
however , just after midnight yesterday new transport secretary @entity28 was forced to admit that civil servants working on the @entity2 contract ' failed to take into account the effect of inflation on the bids or the passenger number increases needed to make them viable '			1
the revelation came ahead of a legal challenge brought by @entity9 against the awarding of the contract to @entity12			1
mr @entity28 's predecessor @entity41 , who was in charge when the contract was awarded , is also understood to have sought assurances			2
the week before being moved to the @entity46 , ms @entity41 was told there were ' small but non-critical ' errors in the contest and she ordered an investigation			0
@entity52 insists the model used by officials was ' incredibly complex ' and it is ' totally unrealistic to expect ministers to have grasped that level of detail '			2
' we feel very let down by it all , ' said a source			0
however , ministers still face criticism for failing to insist on full checks being made , which could have established earlier that the model being used was wrong			0
in a television interview in august , sir @entity10 declared that the only ‘ who can really intervene to try to get some sense into the @entity21 is the prime minister ’			1
it is understood that mr @entity0 then asked the @entity21 to carry out a review of its calculations , but it returned the same response			0
since then it has been established that the complex model was wrong			0
public plea : sir @entity10 made a direct appeal to @entity0 to intervene in the decision to award the franchise to @entity12 the pm is now said to be furious about the handling of the multi-billion - pound franchise bid			1
a source said the revelation that the @entity21 had made serious errors had ‘ gone down like a cup of cold sick ’ in @entity52			1
the decision to cancel the bidding process would cost £ 40million , but most observers expect the final bill to rise to well over £ 100million because of potential compensation claims from @entity12 and the costs associated with a complete overhaul of the franchise system			1
@entity52 is firmly pinning the blame on civil servants			1
the @entity21 ’s permanent secretary @entity99 has suspended three civil servants , two of them senior , connected with the franchise bid			1
ms @entity41 , and @entity102 , who was rail minister before being promoted to @entity103 , both face criticism for failing to uncover the problems sooner			0
but a government source said : ' even the harshest critics can understand that we have to rely on the advice we get			0
' this is one of those rare occasions where you have to be a management consultant - type person who understands how the 500 - column spreadsheet works			0
' @entity12 was due to take over the franchise from @entity118 which runs services between @entity120 and @entity121 from december 9			2
but just after midnight on wednesday mr @entity28 scrapped the deal , laying the blame ‘ wholly and squarely ’ on civil servants			1
all change : the competition to run the @entity2 , which runs from @entity120 to @entity121 , has been cancelled today @entity128 mp @entity127 , who chairs @entity130 's powerful @entity129 , demanded sweeping changes to the way @entity133 is run			2
‘ it exposes in a very stark way that the present conventions on accountability between civil servants and ministers to @entity140 and the public are n't working			1
‘ it 's yet another example ... of where the civil servants themselves have not really captured and taken on the role that is expected of them in today 's society			1
’ she said civil servants should stay in post for longer			1
‘ the way you climb the greasy pole in the civil service is that you change your job every couple of years , ’ she said			2
‘ that 's a disaster			0
’ former cabinet secretary @entity160 , who retired last december , admitted the @entity2 fiasco ‘ does raise some issues about skills in the civil service ’			1
he blamed ‘ skills shortages ’ and suggested higher salaries would need to be paid : ‘ it 's not that they 're greedy , but pay is a measure of how much they feel they 're valued			1
’ the @entity174 's director @entity173 said the debacle ' goes to the heart of the civil service 's credibility and reputation for competence ’			1
he added : ‘ at a time when relations between some ministers and some senior civil servants are already strained , the disclosures could hardly be more damaging			2
’ a q&a about the @entity2 rail franchise fiasco the government is also under growing pressure to launch an urgent review its £ 32billion @entity194 ( @entity193 ) rail line from @entity120 to @entity195			2
with the competence of @entity21 officials now in doubt , former @entity197 cabinet minister @entity196 has demanded an ‘ immediate review ’ of the @entity193 scheme while opponents say the revelation will bolster their legal challenge			2
opponents of @entity193 , who have long argued the business case for the line does not stack up , have seized on the revelations as proof that the @entity21 has got its figures wrong			0
ms @entity196 , a former welsh secretary who left the @entity213 in last month ’s reshuffle , has now written to mr @entity28 asking him ‘ to urgently undertake a complete re-examination of the business case , a re-evaluation of the case for @entity193 and the basis on which all decisions have been made by the @entity21 and @entity193 ’			0
today the @entity21 insisted that specific flaws found in the bungled @entity2 competition do not directly affect the @entity193 case			0
but as the blame game continues every contract and project signed off by the @entity21 is under scrutiny			0
@entity227 , campaign coordinator for the @entity229 group , said : ‘ we have been saying since the start that the passenger forecast which have been fabricated purely to support the case for @entity193 are a work of pure fiction			0
‘ it may not be the same people who have fiddled the figures for the @entity2 , but they have been using the same flawed methodologies to try and justify the case for @entity193			0
‘ there are currently 45,000 people per day coming into @entity241 , but the @entity21 and @entity193 have been saying that magically this will somehow get up to 146,000			0
it is and has always been pure fantasy			0
‘ we are confident that as the @entity21 prepare for the legal challenges on @entity193 that they will find the same sorts of mistakes are endemic throughout the case for @entity193			0
' there is rapidly becoming only one option for @entity193 , to cancel the project as it stands , go back to the drawing board and come up with a genuine strategy for transport and infrastructure			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity21 said : ' the technical flaws found in this rail franchise competition process have no bearing on the case for @entity193 or the government ; s commitment to continuing unprecedented levels of investment in @entity264 's railway network			2
' yesterday mr @entity28 acknowledged his department had fatally miscalculated the risk attached to the rival projects			0
mr @entity28 said the decision to cancel the bidding process would cost £ 40million , but most observers expect the final bill to rise to well over £ 100million because of potential compensation claims from @entity12 and the costs associated with a complete overhaul of the franchise system .			2
