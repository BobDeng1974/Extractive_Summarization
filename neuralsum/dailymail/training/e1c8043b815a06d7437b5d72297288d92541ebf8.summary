lorry drivers are being ordered to avoid @entity1 because of confrontations with knife - wielding illegal immigrants who are trying to get to @entity4			1
cross-channel haulage firms are advising drivers to use other ports – including @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 – to transport goods to the @entity4 to prevent migrants clambering into their vehicles			1
up to 2,000 foreigners – mainly @entity14 and @entity15 – have massed at @entity1 in a desperate bid to reach our shores where they will be able to claim benefits if they fail to find jobs			1
angry truckers have told of desperate migrants armed with knives , iron bars and other weapons who leap on to @entity4 - bound ferries			1
at the weekend police launched a hunt for an @entity47 @entity46 people - smuggler who pointed a pump - action shotgun at them as they arrested 15 illegal immigrants who were attempting to stow away in the back of a wagon parked in @entity1			2
and three @entity54 migrants suffered severe knife wounds during a vicious fight in the centre of the town over the right to a favourite spot to leap onto passing lorries			0
the migrants lie in wait in groups at junctions where lorries have to slow down and stop			0
aided by unscrupulous criminal gangs , they risk their lives trying to open the trailers doors and jump inside before the targeted vehicles drive on			0
on saturday , 17 migrants suffering from lack of oxygen were discovered huddled inside a @entity74 tanker and were rescued only after the driver heard them banging to be released – a chilling echo of the @entity78 migrants , one of whom had died , who were discovered at @entity81 earlier this month			0
meanwhile , hundreds of migrants attempted to break into stationary @entity4 - bound lorries when a motorway to @entity1 ground to a halt with a huge traffic jam			1
taking action : @entity88 held top - level talks with @entity1 officials on friday in a bid to tackle the crisis @entity94 police were forced to divert trucks on other routes as the numbers of potential stowaways became so great they were unmanageable			1
now many haulage firms are telling drivers to use other @entity94 ports to reach the @entity4 – raising concerns that new migrants camps will also spring up in those towns			1
others , however , can not avoid @entity1 because they have fixed - term contracts with ferry companies that depart from there			2
@entity109 , 34 , a trucker from @entity110 , said transport company bosses had ordered drivers to avoid @entity1 when crossing the @entity113 amid fears of harm to employees and goods			2

the migrants cause a lot of damage			0
‘ in the old days it was easy to monitor their movements			0
now there are dozens at a time and they are more organised and quite capable of staging diversions			0
‘ it ’s like being in a war zone			0
the only difference is that we have no body armour and ca n’t carry guns			0
sooner or later some driver is going to get killed			0
’ a member of staff at a truck stop in @entity1 , close to the migrants ’ camp , said : ‘ it ’s no wonder that drivers are now avoiding @entity1 if they can			2
you only have to look outside to see the scale of the problem			0
‘ the migrants are everywhere hanging around the trucks whilst they refill or the drivers have a meal or take a shower			0
