a @entity1 couple have created a @entity3 - based alternative to popular @entity5 tradition , the @entity6 , calling their version @entity9 on the @entity10			1
@entity11 and @entity12 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , came up with the idea after seeing how envious their son @entity16 was of all his friends who were able to partake in the the increasingly - popular @entity6 customs			1
eager to create a @entity1 alternative to the festive toy based around their own religious traditions , the couple designed @entity26 the @entity9			1
that is what started this whole thing , ' @entity11 wrote on the couple 's @entity44 page , through which they managed to raise more than $ 22,000 to fund the project			1
' our son @entity16 wanted to be like many of his friends and get an @entity6 , but being @entity1 , the answer was no. that got us thinking			1
' @entity55 is a new tradition ... so why could n't we , as @entity1 , add a new tradition to our holiday to add some more @entity59 to @entity3			0
' we created the story of @entity26 the @entity9			2
@entity26 was at the @entity61 when the @entity62 returned victorious from the war			0
@entity64 was exhausted from the fighting and he wanted to go to bed			0
@entity67 sized : the @entity9 on the @entity10 range has expanded to include a limited edition doll and a five foot stuffed @entity26 figure ( pictured ) the best of friends : many elf on the @entity75 fans have already added a @entity9 on the @entity10 to their collection and are documenting the characters ' friendship on @entity79 ' but , with only enough oil left for one night , @entity64 was worried the lights would go out in the middle of the night			1
@entity26 volunteered to sit on the bench of the @entity61 and tell everyone if the lights went out			0
what a @entity9 sitting on that bench			0
' since reaching their funding goal in may last year , the @entity11 , a former @entity89 employee , and @entity12 have already expanded @entity30 on a @entity10 range , which now includes a limited edition @entity26 doll and a five foot stuffed @entity26 , which has surprisingly proved to be fairly popular with customers			2
unlike @entity97 's scout elves , who return to the @entity98 every night in order to report back on their children 's behavior , the @entity9 remains with the family in order to watch over their @entity105 throughout the night to ensure that the flames keep burning bright			0
each @entity9 comes complete with a book documenting the story of @entity26 , and a set of eight rules for the family to follow in the weeks leading up to their @entity3 celebration			2
enjoying some festive fun : just like the @entity6 , @entity26 the @entity9 enjoys capturing his nighttime antics on camera so that he can share them with the family come morning midnight mission : unlike @entity97 's scout elves , @entity26 the @entity9 remains in the house all night in order to watch over the family 's @entity105 and ensure it keeps burning until morning ' every day of @entity3 , make sure you give your @entity9 a @entity125 candle to hold ... and every night use that candle to light your @entity105 , ' one rule reads , while another adds : ' one night of @entity3 do n't open presents yourself , instead buy presents and give them to people in need			1
' remember that a true @entity9 is one who puts smiles on other people 's faces			0
' much like fans of the @entity6 , the @entity9 's followers are also encouraged to document their doll 's various escapades around the house and then share the images on @entity79 using the hashtag # menschonabench			1
thus far , the @entity9 has been captured in a number of hilarious positions , from sledding down a makeshift mountain with his @entity5 counterpart , the @entity6 , to enjoying a potato sack race against computer game heroes @entity148 and @entity149			2
in one image , the religious figure is even seen enjoying a bottle of red wine			0
naughty or nice ? some of the images of @entity26 the @entity9 are slightly more mischievous than others a @entity157 : the @entity6 has become increasingly popular in recent years and it 's not just @entity1 families who @entity11 and @entity12 hope will enjoy the new @entity3 tradition			1
# ' the product is designed for young @entity1 families , but is a great introduction to @entity3 for those not of the @entity1 faith , ' the couple wrote on their @entity44 page			2
' in the end our goal is to increase active participation in @entity3 and make the celebration of the holiday even more fun than it is today			0
' we also want to teach kids what it is to be a true @entity9 and teach them to strive to make a positive difference in the world around them .			0

@entity1 couple @entity11 and @entity12 were able to fund the *initial* *launch* of the entertaining toy thanks to a @entity44 campaign
