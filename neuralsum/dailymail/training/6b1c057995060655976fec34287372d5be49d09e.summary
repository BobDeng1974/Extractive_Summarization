with its horns , long white body and slithery form , it looks like a mythical beast but this four - metre long horned creature is only too real - as the stench from its decomposing flesh proved			1
the mysterious sea creature was washed ashore in @entity9 , @entity10 - and tests are being done on the carcass to determine what it is			1
the four - metres long creature , seen with its head detached from its body , is in an advanced state of decomposition a swimmer stumbled across the horn head and decayed body on a @entity10 beach an unfortunate swimmer stumbled across the head before coming across the rest of the body , the @entity24 reported			1
@entity30 said : ' we have no idea what it can be , but it smelled bad , because it was so badly decomposed ' , @entity29 reported			0
she added : ' a lady found one part , and we helped her retrieve the rest … we have no idea what it was			0
it really stank , as it was in the advanced stages of decomposition , ' @entity40 reported			0
the extent of the deterioration of the creature meant most of the remains had to be buried for safety reasons			1
several theories have been suggested about what the creature is - ranging from it being a type of shark to it being an oar fish , but researchers are still examining it			1
programa en @entity60 ( @entity59 ) spokesman @entity58 was also puzzled , @entity57 reported			1
several theories have been suggested about what the creature is - ranging from it being a type of shark to it being an oar fish he said : ' it 's hard to know what we ’re dealing with , ' mr @entity67 told ideal.es			1
' it is broken up and we can not identify what ii is			0
maybe it 's a bull fish ' , he joked			0
' perhaps if we were able to analyse the bones we might know more , but for this specific genetic analysis it is very expensive and who would pay ? ' we 've certainly never before seen anything like this			2
' a spokesman for the @entity83 said : ' a few people have said it could be the backbone of a shark with the rest of it decaying away			2
' really we would need a vertebrae to properly identify it			0
if it was a shark it would have cartilage skeleton as opposed to bone			2
' as for the horns - it 's pretty inconclusive			0
no one knows of anything with horns in the sea			0
from the picture you wonder if it is even part of the creature			2

@entity10 ***marine*** **biologists** mystified by the creature that was *spotted* dead in the *shallows* by a woman on the beach at @entity110
