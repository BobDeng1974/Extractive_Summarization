@entity1 manager @entity0 believes the loan signing of @entity4 forward @entity2 will add another dimension to his attacking options			1
the @entity7 is hopeful the deal to bring the 22 - year - old to @entity10 will be concluded by thursday			1
@entity2 's arrival would supplement the resources @entity0 already has at his disposal , led by marquee summer signing @entity14 - also from @entity4			1
on the move : @entity4 and @entity17 winger @entity2 is set to join @entity1 on a season - long loan deal busy : @entity1 boss @entity0 is still keen to sign another striker before the transfer window closes striker @entity21 is still at least a month away from fully recovering from a knee injury which kept him out for most of last season while @entity27 , like his @entity26 team - mate @entity14 , is still getting up to speed having returned to training later than many of his team - mates due to his @entity32 commitments			1
@entity33 is another alternative up front or off the right but @entity17 international @entity2 will give @entity1 something extra in the same way @entity40 forward @entity39 did in his loan spell last season			1
' we are hoping that the deal can be formalised and finalised by thursday , ' @entity0 told evertontv			2
' that would be a really good positive move to boost the squad			2
how ready he will be to have him in the team , it 's too early to tell but we want @entity52 to be part of the squad as soon as we can			0
' we are really excited and are desperate to welcome him to @entity56 ( training ground ) to allow him to feel the @entity1 way quickly			2
' @entity52 is a experienced young man and to be that experienced at a young age is incredible			0
' he had a really good spell in @entity62 then a big move and has played a lot of games in @entity66			0
playing in a @entity32 with @entity17 will give him a lot too			0
' he can play on both wings , play through the middle and has appreciation of space			0
' technically he is very gifted and will fit extremely well			0
he has the hunger and desire to want to show what he can do in the @entity76 and we feel we are ready to give him that opportunity			0
' new boy : @entity2 will join midfielder @entity81 among the new recruits at @entity10 this summer video @entity84 experience vital for @entity1 - @entity0			1

@entity2 is set to spend next season on loan at @entity1
