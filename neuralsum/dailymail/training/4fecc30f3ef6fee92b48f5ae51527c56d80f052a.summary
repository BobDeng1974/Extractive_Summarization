@entity4 , 37 , led massive protests against the @entity15 last year and had intended to challenge mr @entity7 for the @entity17 presidency			1
he was convicted of embezzling £ 325,000 in a timber deal , after what was denounced by his supporters as a show trial ‘ redolent of the @entity22 era ’			1
his jailing was widely seen as a tactic to prevent him running for @entity28 mayor this year and challenging mr @entity7 for the @entity15 in 2018			0
foreign secretary @entity29 blasted ‘ the selective application of the rule of law in @entity17 ’			2
former @entity17 leader @entity32 and @entity33 , @entity34 ambassador to @entity17 , also condemned the political use of courts			2
@entity4 , one of president @entity7 's biggest critics , was led away from court by law enforcement officers after the judge pronounced the sentence in the industrial city of @entity43			2
prosecutors had asked for a six - year sentence			0
@entity4 was found guilty of heading a group that embezzled 16 million rubles ( £ 330,000 ) worth of timber from state - owned company @entity48 in 2009 while he worked as an unpaid adviser to the provincial governor in @entity43			1
that was the same year that @entity4 , a lawyer , started an anti-corruption blog that attracted a wide following and propelled him into becoming a key opposition figure			1
it was @entity4 who called the dominant @entity13 ' the party of crooks and thieves ' - a phrase that became a rallying cry for the nascent opposition to @entity17 's leader , @entity7			1
backers say he is innocent , calling the trial unfair and the evidence against him shoddy			0
the @entity34 and @entity68 both criticszed the ruling within hours , arguing that the case appeared to be politically motivated			0
while waiting for the sentence for him and co-defendant @entity73 - who was also found guilty of embezzlement - @entity4 played with his smartphone and occasionally smiled sardonically			1
a post on his @entity78 account during the long verdict reading noted the thick packet of papers the judge was reading and said : ' we 're going crazy while we listen			0
' @entity73 ran a timber trading company in @entity43 during @entity4 's time in the region			1
@entity4 was a top leader of the wave of massive protest rallies that broke out in late 2011 after a national parliamentary election scarred by allegations of widespread fraud			2
the conviction does not immediately nullify his candidacy			0
that would n't happen until his defense team exhausted its appeals , which could take several months			0
it 's unclear whether the conviction would intimidate his supporters or undermine the activists who have coalesced around him			0
the judge said he found the testimony of key prosecution witness @entity121 to be ' trustworthy and consistent			0
' @entity121 , who was the timber company 's general director , got a suspended sentence in an expedited trial in december after pleading guilty to conspiring with @entity4			1
well - wishers : @entity17 opposition leader @entity4 , right , shakes hands with opposition lawmaker @entity127 before his sentencing @entity4 insists @entity121 framed him out of revenge			1
@entity4 had recommended that @entity121 be fired and that officials investigate potential corruption in his company , which had incurred 200 million rubles ( £ 4million ) in losses by the time @entity4 arrived in the region			1
throughout the trial , testimony of prosecution witnesses clashed with the core arguments of the indictment that claimed @entity4 's work in @entity43 led to the embezzlement			2
none of the managers at @entity48 who appeared in court , except for @entity121 , were able to confirm that @entity4 defrauded the company			0
@entity4 had long said he expected to be convicted , and in a final blog post before leaving @entity28 for @entity43 , he downplayed his personal importance to the wider opposition			2
' the most important thing is to muster up the strength , shake off laziness and do something			0
this does n't require any leadership as such , ' he wrote .			0
