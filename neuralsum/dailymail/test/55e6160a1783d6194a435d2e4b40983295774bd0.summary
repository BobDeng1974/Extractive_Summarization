@entity7 allegedly told two different funeral directors that there were no objections , including from her former spouse , to her son being cremated after his death			1
as a result no - one attended the early morning cremation of @entity17 in december 2010 after it happened without his father 's knowledge , jurors heard			2
@entity7 , 56 , is said to have deliberately ' pressed ahead ' with her plans , despite knowing her ex , @entity21 , would have objected			2
@entity7 , 56 , is on trial at @entity23 , pictured , in relation to the cremation of her son @entity27 , prosecuting , opened the case against @entity7 for jurors on the first day of her trial at @entity23			2
' this is an unusual and very sad case which involves the @entity32 , ' she said			0
' in a nutshell , the @entity34 's case is that the defendant told two different funeral directors , at two different times , that there were no objections from anyone , including mr @entity21 , to her son being cremated and also signed two forms to the same effect			1
' @entity34 says that the first time she did this she simply did n't know whether mr @entity21 objected to the cremation or not , as she had n't bothered to ask			0
' ms @entity27 alleged that by the time @entity7 signed a second form she knew mr @entity21 objected to any funeral which would involve the disposal of their son 's body , unless he knew the details of where and when it was to take place			1
but , the court heard , the defendant went ahead with the cremation despite mr @entity21 's disapproval being made clear to her by his solicitors			1
@entity7 , 56 , denies one offence of making a false representation to procure the burning of human remains , and two counts of signing false certificates ahead of her son 's funeral			1
jurors were told that mr @entity17 was just 32 - years - old when he died in hospital on november 11 , 2010 , from a long - standing health condition			0
his parents went through an ' acrimonious ' divorce in 1983 , but subsequent contact relating to their son was described in court as being marred by dispute and conflict			0
@entity7 , who registered her son 's death , is alleged to have instructed an undertaker on november 12 , that mr @entity21 was to have no involvement with any of the funeral arrangements			1
by november 15 , the defendant is said to have been adamant that she did not want mr @entity21 to attend the funeral , which was originally set for november 24			0
at one point amid mediation involving lawyers , @entity7 , the crown claims , met an undertaker and signed a form stating that no near relatives were unaware of the proposed cremation			0
but an undertaker then became ' troubled ' and told @entity7 he could not continue with the arrangements , leading her to dispense with his services			0
it is alleged she then went to another funeral firm and signed the second form on december 15 , booking a cremation for her son 's remains on december 20			1
during her opening speech , miss @entity27 said of mr @entity17 's cremation : ' he was ' slotted in ' early in the morning when people with no relatives are burnt			0
' mr @entity21 was not present at his son 's funeral or cremation despite every effort to do so			1
' mr @entity21 told the court he found out the cremation had taken place in a phone message left for him by a solicitor			2
@entity7 is alleged to have told @entity118 in @entity119 , pictured , that there were no objections to the cremation giving evidence from the witness box , he told jurors he learned of the cremation at 1pm on december 20			1
mr @entity21 was then advised by a lawyer that he could seek a court order to stop his son 's ashes being disposed of in his absence			1
' he ( the solicitor ) applied for it but did n't get it through quickly enough , ' mr @entity21 told the court			0
mr @entity21 contacted police shortly afterwards but @entity7 was not interviewed until last december , when she asserted that he knew she intended to cremate her son and had not objected			2
funeral director @entity137 also gave evidence to the trial			0
he said he had suggested the possible solution of having two separate services on different days for @entity142 and mr @entity21 in @entity143 and @entity144 respectively			0
but @entity7 of @entity144 then emailed the co-operative funeral service 's contact centre saying she did not want her ex-husband to attend the cremation or to have a separate service			2
the trial was adjourned until tomorrow			0
