by @entity0 the symmetry was almost cruel			0
a week that began with @entity4 ’s prediction that @entity5 could win ‘ 15 to 20 majors ’ was ending with @entity7 limping out of yet another tournament			1
while 36 - hole leader @entity5 went about his weekend ’s work at the @entity10 here with all the single - minded ruthlessness of a man who expected to win , the last incumbent to feel such empowerment was resigned to feeling all too mortal			1
who knows when we will next see @entity7 , destined perhaps to be stuck forever just outside the range of achievement that represented his lifetime goal , but it did not sound like it would be at the @entity22 or before the fall of autumn leaves			1
in pain : the 14 - time major champion has been a shadow of his former self as injuries interrupt his game ‘ what this week has shown me is that i have to get stronger and i ca n’t do that playing tournament golf , ’ he said			1
‘ you ca n’t burn the candle at both ends			0
’ one thing for certain is that @entity7 is done for this @entity38 year , which ends in mid-september , having racked up statistics of such mind - numbing mediocrity that those of us who have followed him his entire career can feel merely sadness that it has come to this			1
here in the hometown of the @entity48 , we now know how boxing writers felt covering the last years of @entity50			0
either side of missing four months of the season owing to back surgery , @entity7 played seven @entity38 events , withdrawing twice , missing two halfway cuts , finishing no better than 25th and making a total £ 64,000			1
that is less than he made in each of 176 other events throughout his career			0
in two majors , he racked up his worst 72 - hole finish in a @entity62 event at @entity63 and followed it by missing the halfway cut here by five shots , after two rounds of 74 left him 16 strokes behind @entity5			1
pulling out : @entity69 says he expects @entity7 to make @entity71 's decision for him , but choosing not to play @entity72 will not play in the @entity73 this week and can not play in the @entity75 play - offs that follow because he has not qualified , meaning that , if @entity22 captain @entity71 picked him on september 2 , it would be a gamble beyond reckless			1
it would also be doing @entity7 no favours , for what we saw last week was pitiful			2
at 38 , with his long list of injuries , fully fit is a goal that is simply unattainable			0
but he has to get to a point where he can swing the club free of pain before we see him again			0
the only thing on his schedule is a lucrative exhibition date in @entity94 at the end of october and that sounds a suitable timeframe to see if his body can heal to the point where it will allow him to resume his career			2
credit woods for the way he conducted himself afterwards			0
he was clearly in considerable discomfort but did not duck his media duties , spending 15 minutes answering questions from the media			0
when will we see you again ? what will you be saying to @entity71 ? how long will it take to get healthy ? and so on			1
there were no particularly revealing answers because what can he say until he gets healthy ? forget any thoughts about 18 majors			0
that is the only goal the 14 - time major winner should have now			1
pulling out : @entity69 says he expects @entity7 to make @entity71 's decision for him , but choosing not to play while @entity7 left the building , enter his natural successor riding the form of his life			1
how poetic that @entity5 should take 133 shots for his first two rounds , just as @entity7 did in winning the @entity38 here in 2000			1
@entity5 will try to add the @entity129 today to the @entity130 he won just three sundays ago and make it four majors claimed from the last 15 played			2
one major a year is the sort of ratio @entity4 and @entity7 managed in their heyday , when they had little else to worry about but playing golf			1
even if he does not win on sunday , it would not change anything for @entity5			2
he knows the next five years are the ones where , if he is going to make it into double digits in majors , he has to do the damage			0
there was enough going on in his second round on friday to act as a wake - up call that number four was not a given			2
true , he shot 67 , but he knew he would be lucky to do that again if his long game was as average			0
waiting to pounce : @entity5 may not win this week , but now is his time as @entity7 's comes to an end a good - looking leaderboard was also packed with fearless opponents			1
@entity157 @entity156 began just one behind , while @entity159 was two adrift			0
both will win majors at some point			0
there were the doughty veterans @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 , plus a couple of unsung @entity171 in @entity172 from @entity173 and perhaps @entity171 ’s most underrated golfer , @entity175 ’s @entity174			0
no wonder @entity5 was concentrating on the job at hand			2
‘ he obviously thinks i ’m pretty good then , ’ he said , grinning , when asked about @entity4 ’s majors remark			0
‘ i ’m just trying to get to four and , when i do , i ’ll try to get to five and so on			0
i do n’t want to put a number on how many because if you say you want 15 and you ‘ only ’ win 10 , does that mean you ’ll feel disappointed ? ’ let us enjoy the @entity5 era while we can			1
one look at @entity7 emphasises the point that , even for the great ones , it does not last forever .			2

woods cut a sorry sight as injury hampered his second round
the 14 - time major champion now has to focus on getting himself healthy
it would be a *massive* gamble for @entity71 to pick him for the @entity22
we must enjoy @entity5 's time - @entity7 has shown hos *quickly* it can all end
