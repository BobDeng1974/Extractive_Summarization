in one of the most bizarre remarks ever made by a presidential candidate , the @entity11 challenger outlined how he might carry out an attack – comments critics claimed exposed @entity6 ’s weaknesses			1
they were revealed just hours after videotapes of mr @entity2 showed him making a series of derogatory remarks about @entity6 , @entity22 , @entity23 and the @entity24			1
‘ i mean this is where we have – where @entity6 could be held up and blackmailed by @entity45 , by the mullahs , by crazy people			2
so we do n’t have any option but to keep @entity45 from having a nuclear weapon			0
’ in another secretly filmed video clip , mr @entity2 claimed there was no point trying to appeal to @entity68 voters because they were ‘ freeloaders who do n’t pay taxes ’			1

he said : ‘ as we were walking through this facility , seeing them work , the number of hours they worked the pittance they earned			0
‘ and around this factory was a fence , a huge fence with barbed wire and guard towers			0
and we said gosh , i ca n’t believe that you , you know , keep these girls in			0
‘ and they said , no , no , no. this is to keep other people from coming in			0

last night , @entity166 , mr @entity74 ’s campaign manager , said : ‘ it ’s shocking that a candidate for president would go behind closed doors and declare to a group of wealthy donors that half the @entity6 people view themselves as ‘ victims ’ entitled to handouts , and are unwilling to take ' personal responsibility ' for their lives			1
‘ it ’s hard to serve as a president when you ’ve disdainfully written off half the nation			0
’ @entity183 , a @entity22 lawmaker and scholar , said mr @entity2 ’s remarks were ‘ irresponsible and dangerous ’			2
mission : @entity163 's grandson @entity162 says he had been researching films on @entity11 ' almost every day ' and that he did it ' just for fun ' however , the politician said he stood by the remarks which were ‘ not elegantly stated ’			2
the fundraiser where @entity2 made the fateful remarks was thrown in may by hedge fund manager @entity159 , who has developed a reputation as a party boy			1

' my expectation is that if you want to be president , you have to work for everyone , not just for some , ' he said			0
' what i think people want to be sure of is you are not writing off big chunks of the country because the way our democracy works			0
' he also criticized @entity2 for saying 47 percent of @entity6 think of themselves as ' victims , ' saying the @entity244 is alive and well among all of the voters he meets			1
@entity2 did n't score marks for his choice of words -- even from his own running mate , who called the comments ' obviously inarticulate			1

' the audio of the tape was posted on @entity154 on tuesday and dated october 1998			0

the president ’s view is one of a larger government			0
there is a tape that came out where is the president is saying he likes redistribution			0
i disagree , ' @entity2 told @entity271			2

that will not build a strong @entity6 or help people out of poverty			0
