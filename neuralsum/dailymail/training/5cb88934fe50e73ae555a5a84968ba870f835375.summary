@entity7 , who is head of the catholic girls boarding school @entity8 in @entity10 , was speaking at an end of term assembly about mental health and eating disorders among teens			1

warning : @entity7 , head of @entity22 in @entity10 , has warned that schoolgirls who ask their parents for healthy meals may be showing early signs of an eating disorder the head of the £ 10,000 - a - term institution warned parents to be wary of their daughters asking to follow a ' healthy diet ' - as the request could be a ' euphemism ' for eating very little			1
mrs @entity33 said : ' the biggest pressure is to be thin			2
' but , of course , the catch is that if they reduce their food intake they will not have the energy to cope with a packed life here at school			0
' all too quickly they could head for some type of eating disorder			2
' pressure : mrs @entity33 said exam stress and heavy workloads - particularly in female pupils aged between 14 and 18 - can trigger mental illness , which in turn may lead to an eating disorder ( library image ) according to @entity53 , she added : ' just a hint to parents , do not be caught out by your daughter 's wish to eat a ' healthy ' diet			1
this is often a euphemism for eating very little indeed			0

worry : the head said young girls feel pressured to look a certain way - so drop their food intake in a bid to be thin the headmistress said : ' some will become over-anxious and display particular mental health issues connected with this			1
' mrs @entity33 's warning comes as research indicates teenage girls could be more prone to depression and anxiety as they experience greater blood flow to the brain			2
hormone oestrogen drives more blood to the heads of young women compared to men - and that could explain disparities in psychiatric disorders , scientists at the @entity98 claim			0
blood flow is known to be higher in adult women than men , but the study now shows it is markedly different during adolescence when teenagers are going through puberty			0
according to the @entity106 website , eating disorders are most commonly blamed on social pressures to be thin			2
however , those with a family history of depression are also more likely to develop the three main types of eating disorder - anorexia nervosa , bulimia or a binge eating			1

according to the @entity106 , around one in 250 women will experience anorexia at some point - with the condition usually developing around the age of 16 or 17			0
one in 2,000 men will also experience such disorder			0
bulimia is around five times more common than anorexia , research shows , and 90 per cent of people with bulimia are female			0
the condition usually develops around the age of 18 or 19			0
binge eating usually affects males and females equally and often appears later in life - between the ages of 30 and 40			0
