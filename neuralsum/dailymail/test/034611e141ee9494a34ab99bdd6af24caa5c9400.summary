the semi-final line - up for the @entity3 has been confirmed and , although there may be no @entity6 involvement , four @entity1 giants are just three games from being crowned champions of the continent in @entity10 on june 6			1
with @entity13 and @entity14 winning on wednesday to join @entity15 and @entity16 in the last four , this season 's competition is one of the toughest to call in recent memory			1
we asked our team of reporters who they think will win this season 's @entity3			1
@entity23 - @entity15 momentum is key at this point in the season and @entity15 are in overdrive			2
their early - season woes are a distant memory and @entity30 is finally getting his point across			0
@entity32 remains phenomenal and a certain @entity33 is hitting top gear just at the right time			0
@entity15 's formidable front three of @entity33 ( left ) , @entity35 ( centre ) and @entity32 ( right ) @entity37 - @entity16 they overcame their blip ( the rip in the seam of @entity43 's trousers ) to power their way beyond @entity45 in the second leg of the quarter - final and remind everyone just how good they are			1
they have much to prove after last season 's disappointment but they are a phenomenal team			0
i expect them to draw @entity15 in the semi-final			2
@entity16 produced a stunning display in the second leg to beat @entity45 in the quarter - finals @entity60 - @entity15 @entity16 and @entity15 are both better teams than @entity14 or @entity13 and to separate them is nigh on impossible			1
but given the backroom strife at @entity16 , particularly over @entity63 's injury , i 'd narrowly go for @entity32 and @entity15 ending their four - year @entity3 ' drought '			1
@entity65 - @entity15 to think at the start of the season , after @entity13 pummelled them in the first @entity68 , that we thought @entity70 had started			1
now they look majestic once more and the front three of @entity32 , @entity35 and @entity33 gives them an edge over all their rivals			0
hopefully it will be a straight shootout between them and @entity16 in @entity10			0
this is the best @entity3 semi-final line - up ever and we might get the spectacular final to go with it			2
@entity81 - @entity14 @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity85 - experience , goals and know - how			2
@entity82 is n't @entity32 ( or @entity88 ) , @entity83 is n't @entity89 and @entity85 is n't @entity90 : yes , they are ugly bugs on a catwalk of super powers , but they can win this			0
after all , @entity96 and @entity97 both won the @entity98			0
@entity14 celebrate their 1 - 0 aggregate victory over @entity100 in the last eight of the @entity3 @entity14 striker @entity82 leads the scoring in @entity103 this season with 18 goals @entity106 - @entity15 since it 's been established that we do n't live in a @entity110 ( 48 goals in 49 starts ) world i ca n't bring myself to bet against him			1
would love to see them in a final against @entity16			0
@entity117 - @entity16 after that crushing 5 - 0 aggregate defeat by @entity13 in the semi-finals a year ago , and the shock of suffering a 3 - 1 first - leg loss to @entity45 in this season â€™s quarters , expect the real @entity16 to stand up and deliver another @entity3 triumph for @entity126			1
is it written in the stars that @entity15 will be standing in his way ? @entity131 - @entity15 the front three of @entity32 , @entity33 , and @entity35 are beginning to click to devastating effect and the magical allure of @entity15 is returning			2
it would be some turnaround from the disputes and disappointments of early season , but this is a team full of players who know how to win the trophy			0
@entity35 scored both goals in @entity15 's 2 - 0 second - leg victory over @entity145 at the @entity146 @entity147 - @entity13 they might be depleted by injuries but experience and pedigree count in this competition and , as we saw against @entity151 , you can never count against the 10 - time winners			1
or , indeed , a certain ronaldo			0
@entity158 's 88th - minute winner saw @entity13 edge past their local rivals @entity151 @entity88 is looking for his third @entity3 title and a second in a row with @entity13 @entity164 - @entity16 @entity166 and @entity63 are on the way back , @entity165 has a point to prove and the team have the memory of that awful semi-final against @entity13 last year to drive them on			1
as long as they do n't take their foot off the gas having already won the @entity176 , they 'll make good the disappointment of last year			0
@entity178 celebrates one of five first - half goals @entity16 scored against @entity45 on tuesday @entity181 - @entity15 i 'm tempted to say @entity16 but they 've got similar buckling deficiencies to the @entity15 we 've seen recently			1
by contrast , the @entity185 have found their misplaced defensive steel , have a coach whose win percentage eclipses all to precede him and - well - possess @entity32			0
@entity190 - @entity16 i would back @entity126 to outwit any of the remaining managers in the tournament with the players at his disposal			2
some were writing @entity16 off after their 3 - 1 first - leg defeat by @entity45 and look how that went			2
everyone talks about @entity32 and @entity88 , but the collective force of @entity16 players is frightening			0
@entity201 - @entity15 after a difficult start to the season they 've hit form at the right time			1
@entity30 has found a way to get the front three of @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity35 to fire and even if you can keep two of them quiet - as @entity145 did on tuesday - the other will make you pay .			0

@entity15 , @entity16 , @entity14 and @entity13 make up last four
@entity13 are looking to retain their title and win for the 11th time
@entity15 have won three champions @entity217 since 2006
@entity16 are five - time winners and last won at @entity221 in 2013
@entity14 ' two @entity3 wins came in 1985 and 1996
