a review of the evidence used to convict @entity2 of the 1988 @entity4 bombing has confirmed beyond doubt he was responsible for the killings , it has been claimed			1
sources close to the review , carried out by the @entity10 and @entity11 , have said there is ' not a shred of evidence ' to support suggestions he was wrongly convicted			0
the @entity18 intelligence officer was convicted in 2001 for killing 270 people in the bombing of @entity4 , but more than two decades on , there are lingering suspicions he was a scapegoat used to cover up the involvement of other @entity26 countries			2
a new review of the case against him has found there is not a ' shred of evidence ' to support conspiracy claims it 's also been claimed his imprisonment was a price worth paying by @entity18 for the lifting of crippling sanctions , imposed for several years after @entity2 was identified in @entity45 and the @entity46 as the likely bomber			1
however , sources close to the recent review have told the @entity50 that pursuit of the case in @entity18 only confirmed the evidence against @entity2 - and even further implicated @entity53 , who was originally accused but acquitted			1
police claim any planting of evidence to frame @entity2 would needed to have been done within a very short space of time and furthermore , it would require knowledge of all the evidence in the case still to come , the paper reported			2
@entity2 died two years ago after being controversially released from a @entity45 jail in 2009 on compassionate grounds because he had terminal prostate cancer			1
his release , based on the understanding he had only three months to live , caused outrage in the @entity46 , which lost 189 citizens in the terrorist attack			0
relatives in the @entity46 said they remained convinced that @entity2 had been freed to appease the @entity18 government , smoothing the way for a string of lucrative deals			0
all 243 passengers and 16 crew members were killed , as were eleven residents in @entity4 when the plane crashed into the @entity45 town of @entity4 police and investigators work on what remains of @entity4 , which was downed after a bomb was planted on it the man convicted of the @entity4 ( pictured ) was later freed from prison on compassionate grounds to widespread international criticism at the time , @entity46 senator @entity88 said : ' the whole deal smelled of a deal for oil for this man ’s freedom			1
i still believe that the @entity45 government , perhaps with the participation of the @entity97 government , created a major injustice when they let him out			0
' a year after his death , it was revealed @entity2 's release was linked to a £ 400million arms deal with @entity18			2
documents showed ' reprehensible ' connections between the @entity109 government boosting business and freeing the man convicted of @entity97 ’s worst terrorist atrocity			0
an email sent by the then @entity97 ambassador in @entity31 to former premier @entity115 explained how a prisoner transfer agreement will be signed once @entity18 ' fulfils its promise ' to buy an air defence system .			0

a review of the *lockerbie* bombing case confirms the basis for conviction
@entity18 's @entity2 was convicted of the plane attack in 2001
*campaigners* have long claimed his conviction was a *miscarriage* of justice
but a new review of the case has only *underlined* the evidence against him
he died three years after being released on compassionate grounds
