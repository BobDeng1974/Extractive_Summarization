the most remarkable aspect of @entity3 ’s @entity2 shambles is that all the @entity5 top brass from chairman @entity6 downwards are united in wanting @entity7 to remain as manager			1
even those from the @entity5 hierarchy who have witnessed the two successive defeats in @entity13 are staunchly in support of @entity7 , despite @entity3 heading for humiliation at the @entity2 on a par with the @entity18 fiasco last winter			1
the same message that @entity7 should carry on regardless of @entity3 ’s woeful showing came from @entity5 chairman @entity6 and @entity22 , chairman of the @entity24 , as well as the other @entity5 international delegates in @entity26 — @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
in @entity46 has been very vocal in attacking @entity48 president @entity47 , but would only say when asked about @entity7 ’s position : ‘ there ’s another game to go			1
’ there has to be a root - and - branch review by the @entity5 of whether it was worth having over 80 personnel in the official party			2
@entity57 , the highly acclaimed sports psychiatrist , has seemingly made little impact and cut a timid figure after matches when his main role was seemingly helping to carry the team equipment onto the coach			0
when approached , he quickly referred any questions to the @entity5 communications department			0
little impact : @entity57 ( right ) , who was also used by @entity67 last season , has appeared to make little impact on the @entity3 team the @entity3 media centre , installed at a cost of around £ 80,000 at @entity75 ’s @entity74 military camp and the training pitch there — which was even more expensive to prepare — will have been used only eight times if @entity3 go out at the group stage			2
that figure includes manager @entity7 ’s likely final press conference next wednesday			0
the fall - out from an early @entity3 @entity2 exit would reverberate across the @entity5			0
selling @entity84 tickets for an unappetising september friendly against @entity85 will be that more difficult , as will finding the desired global roster of @entity88 sponsors and a new lead partner			0
@entity3 will also lose some of its lustre as a marquee opponent for friendly internationals although , fortunately for the @entity5 , long - term broadcast agreements at home and abroad are in place			0
@entity96 , probably the best player in football not involved in the @entity2 , has been a guest of his @entity99 club president @entity98 on a trip to @entity13			2
@entity96 has watched @entity102 beat @entity103 as well as @entity104 turn over @entity3 , with @entity96 cheering on his @entity99 striker partner @entity105			1
interested party : @entity96 watches @entity3 slump to defeat against @entity104 the @entity5 have had plenty of people freeloading at the @entity2			1
but @entity111 , @entity5 board member and former chairman of the @entity113 and @entity114 , made sure he paid his own way to @entity26 to watch the @entity104 debacle			0
and @entity111 , who withdrew his candidature for the @entity5 chairmanship because he does n’t trust @entity47 ’s @entity48 , only took advantage of his @entity5 position to hitch a lift on the team bus after the game			2
the inquest into @entity3 ’s dismal showing in @entity13 will have to include the merits of having a club @entity3 department within the @entity5 concentrating solely on the national teams at various levels			0
certainly @entity3 ’s senior side performed better results-wise when the now sidelined @entity132 had responsibility for team affairs			0
@entity135 , useless as a @entity137 rugby co-commentator , even worse as a @entity139 contributor and unreadable in the @entity140 , is obsessed with attacking your @entity142 columnist on @entity144			1
anyone trawling his near 50,000 postings would agree this ex-rugby hooker should be first in the queue to see sports psychiatrist @entity57 on his imminent return from the @entity2			2
obsessed : @entity135 continues to attack @entity142 through @entity144			1

@entity5 top brass are in support of @entity7 , despite the *bungling* in @entity13
@entity6 and @entity22 gave @entity7 the *nod* to continue
in @entity157 has been very vocal in attacking @entity48 president @entity47
with over 80 people in @entity3 's official party , the impact of *renowned* psychiatrist @entity57 has been *negligible*
@entity96 was in @entity13 and cheered on @entity99 team - mate @entity105 as @entity104 beat @entity3
@entity135 , useless on the @entity137 , *hopeless* on @entity139 and unreadable in print , continues to attack @entity142 on @entity144
the former @entity3 hooker should be first in the queue to see @entity57 on his return from @entity13
