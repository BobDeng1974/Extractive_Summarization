by @entity0 published : 04:53 est , 6 september 2012 updated : 13:01 est , 6 september 2012 @entity1 will adopt a brand new design of sim card , according to the latest leak which comes just six days before the launch of the highly - anticipated @entity6			1
the sim card is the small plastic card that comes within all phones , and allows your phone to ' hand - shake ' with your network			0
now @entity1 will use @entity14 , according to leaked images by ifun.de , which claims shops in @entity18 have already received batches of @entity6 sim cards			1
this implies the @entity6 , expected to be announced on september 12 , is just weeks away from shipping			0
smaller than ever : the @entity6 's @entity23 - which connects you to the phone network - has gone from full size ( right ) to micro-sized ( also right ) to @entity14 ( left ) @entity28 reports that @entity18 @entity30 stores have received the cards within the last few days , with letters informing staff that the chips are for ' the latest generation of smartphones ' expected ' in the near future '			1
as it happens , for the foreseeable future , @entity1 is the one company expected to be using @entity40			2
when mobile phones first arrived , the sim cards were credit - card - sized , but they have shrunk over the last two decades			0
@entity1 was the first to use the current microsim size , introduced with the @entity45			2
shrinking the sim card brings many advantages to the company - for space is at a premium for any device that wants to remain slim , yet pack in all the features - from decent camera to large battery - that smartphone users expect			0
the invite : @entity1 's minimalist invitation asks people to attend the @entity59 launch event on the 12th - and the shadow of a five forms underneath the little piece of plastic , with a chip embedded inside , handles the logins and security to connect your phone to the phone and data networks			1
without it , a phone is effectively blind , unable to make or receive calls and texts			0
micro-sims came into fashion last year , shaving precious millimeters from the larger form , and @entity14 will take this one step further			0
a @entity79 comes in at 15 x 12 x 0.76 mm , whereas the @entity23 is 12.3 x 8.8 x 0.67 mm , which is about 40 per cent smaller in area			2
the chip itself remains the same size , but the plastic which acts as a buffer for the chip has been pared right back			0
are these the next @entity6 headphones ? @entity90 site @entity88 said @entity1 's distinctive ' buds are being produced at the @entity90 @entity93 factory old versus new : the newer model ( on the left ) have a smaller , one - piece design despite the tide of speculation , the @entity6 is still not actually confirmed by @entity1			1
but it is effectively beyond doubt that the @entity6 will be announced on september 12			0
@entity1 has an annual refresh rate for their smartphone , traditionally unveiling it each september for a launch in october			2
four months ago , spec sheets and components began leaking from various suppliers , and over the last few weeks these have intensified			0
well - known companies such as @entity109 and @entity110 are known to have large orders for @entity1 's next devices			1
the september 12th date has been rumoured since june , and this was confirmed by @entity1 on monday , when it sent a ' @entity115 ' invite out to tech journalists			2
buried within a shadow on the invitation , a subtle ' 5 ' - the only word ( or in this case , a number ) to come from @entity1 about their future plans			1
change : this picture is believed to show a prototype case for the new @entity6 , with its new connector design which is set to make every existing accessory completely obsolete in other recent leaks , @entity90 blogsite @entity88 posted a video of what it claims are newly - designed headphones for the next @entity6 , which is expected to launch on september 12			1
if confirmed , it is the first major redesign of the distinctive white headphones since the @entity6 launched , other than the addition of an in - line microphone and remote control in 2008			0
the headphones , which come bundled with ipods and @entity140 , are one of the most iconic parts of @entity1 's product line - up , and are perhaps most famous for appearing in the famous ' dancing silhouettes ' adverts for the @entity146			1
the @entity6 is also due for a controversial re-design to its dock connector , which will break compatibility with older peripherals and cables , although an adapter is expected to become available .			1

new design is far smaller , and is likely to allow a thinner design
comes after outcry over @entity1 's plans to change its dock connector , *meaning* many will need to dump *speakers* , dock and *chargers*
