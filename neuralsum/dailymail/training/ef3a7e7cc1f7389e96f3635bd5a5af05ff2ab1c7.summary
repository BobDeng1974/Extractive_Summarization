room for improvement has been the saying for this international week but it is not a theme exclusive to @entity6 ’s senior team			1
thanks to a late header from @entity9 , @entity11 ’s unbeaten record as under - 21 head coach but if he is to lead @entity6 to @entity13 , he will recognise a step up is required on this grinding 1 - 0 victory over @entity16			1
for long periods , @entity6 were frustrated by @entity16 ’s stubborn defence and given they will be paired against superior opposition when the play - off draw is made next friday , there are areas for @entity11 to polish as he plots a path to the @entity24			1

goals : @entity9 ( 81 ) bookings : @entity78 ( 57 ) , @entity63 ( 74 ) attendance : 3000 it must be recognised , though , that @entity6 continue to be able to find a way of winning these matches and @entity9 ’s 81st minute effort means they have collected 25 points from a possible 27 in @entity85 with one final assignment in @entity87 remaining			1
‘ we expected a difficult game and we knew they would defend deep , ’ said @entity11			1
‘ but i was pleased that we were patient			0
we kept passing the ball and the beauty of having a strong squad means that we always have options			2
we thought we always had another gear			0
’ when these nations met in @entity97 last october , @entity6 ran riot with @entity99 inspiring a 5 - 0 win but it was clear from an early stage they were not going to find this assignment as straightforward as the one at @entity104			1
if anything , the first 45 minutes were the most laboured this qualification campaign			0
when @entity6 arrived here on thursday evening , the focus of training had been on short , sharp passing and slick movement but they failed to put that into practice			2
most surprisingly , @entity6 looked vulnerable in defence and they were lucky not to fall behind in the 14th minute when , after a sloppy clearance from @entity58 , @entity16 were able to raid forward but @entity116 failed to punish the error when firing over the bar			2
@entity119 : @entity9 came on in the 64th minute to score the only goal of the game scrap : both goalkeepers were at the same end of the pitch as @entity16 pushed for an equaliser talent : @entity128 's @entity70 puts in a tackle for @entity26 @entity6 replied with a couple of half chances – @entity132 , who would later pick up a booking that rules him out of tuesday ’s game in @entity87 , shot wide before @entity135 was off target – but they did not threaten to get @entity16 panicking			1
by contrast , a melee at the other end should have saw @entity16 take the lead in the 39th minute but @entity78 hacked a shot from @entity142 off the line ; it was n’t good enough and the way @entity11 briskly walked back to the dressing room at the break confirmed as much			2
whatever @entity11 said during the interval had some effect , as @entity6 started the second period much brighter			1
@entity70 forced the first meaningful save from @entity150 after a sharp move , one that was met with applause from @entity11			2
slowly but surely , @entity6 went through the gears as @entity155 and @entity65 started to have an influence			0
@entity155 , in particular , was unlucky not to give @entity6 the lead when he hit the bar with a volley that skidded up off the turf			0
it then became a question of whether @entity16 could hold out but their resistance was broken eventually when @entity9 rose highest to flick an inviting cross from @entity63 ’s beyond the grasp of @entity150			0
‘ @entity9 is a goalscorer , ’ said @entity11			1
‘ he is really knocking on the door now			0
we put him on at that stage of the game when they were tiring and he gave us different options			0
he is a penalty box player and it was a very good finish			0
i ’m pleased we were able to get the job done			0

@entity11 had a near full - strength squad going into the match
the @entity6 had already won @entity85 before friday night
a single @entity9 header was enough to *ensure* the win
@entity6 's 1 - 0 win means they have won 8 and drawn 1 in their 9 games
