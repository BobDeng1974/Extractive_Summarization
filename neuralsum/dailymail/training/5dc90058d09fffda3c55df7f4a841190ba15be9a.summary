the smell of flatulence has secret health benefits - and could help stave off cancer , strokes , heart attacks and dementia , scientists have revealed			1
hydrogen sulfide is one of a number of potent smelly gases produced by bacteria as it breaks down food in the gut			1
it is toxic in large doses but in tiny amounts it helps protect cells and fight illness , according to experts at @entity21			1
when cells become stressed by disease they try to draw in enzymes to generate their own minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide			2
the smell of flatulence has secret health benefits - and could help in the fight against strokes , heart attacks and dementia , research has revealed ( file picture ) the chemical helps to preserve mitochondria , which drive energy production in blood vessel cells and regulate inflammation , and without it the cell can switch off and die			1
now researchers have come up with a new compound named @entity43 to assist the body in producing just the right amount of hydrogen sulfide			2
they believe it will help prevent or reverse mitochondrial damage , which is a key strategy in treating conditions such as stroke , heart failure , diabetes , arthritis , dementia and ageing			0
professor @entity56 from @entity21 ’s medical school said : ' when cells become stressed by disease , they draw in enzymes to generate minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide			2
' this keeps the mitochondria ticking over and allows cells to live			0
if this does n’t happen , the cells die and lose the ability to regulate survival and control inflammation			0
' we have exploited this natural process by making a compound , called @entity43 , which slowly delivers very small amounts of this gas specifically to the mitochondria			0
' our results indicate that if stressed cells are treated with @entity43 , mitochondria are protected and cells stay alive			0
' small amounts of hydrogen sulfide could help stave off diseases such as cancer , according to experts at @entity21 before it can be tested on humans , researchers have run disease models to see how effective @entity43 is			1
early results show that it can help up to 80 per cent more mitochondria survive highly destructive conditions such as cardiovascular disease			0
fellow researcher dr. @entity94 added : ' although hydrogen sulfide is well known as a pungent , foul - smelling gas in rotten eggs and flatulence , it is naturally produced in the body and could in fact be a healthcare hero with significant implications for future therapies for a variety of diseases			1
' the study was published in the journal @entity108 .			0

researchers reveal secret health benefits of smelly gas hydrogen sulfide
@entity114 is one of the gases produced as bacteria breaks down food in gut
toxic in large doses but tiny amounts can help protect cells and fight illness
@entity21 experts say the gas has potential to be ' healthcare hero '
scientists produce new compound to help body produce the right amount
