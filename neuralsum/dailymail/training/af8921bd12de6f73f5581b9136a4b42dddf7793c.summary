@entity0 1 - 3 @entity1			1
it was n't pretty , and it was far from easy			0
what @entity3 could have done with , was a striker on top form			2
@entity0 are n't a bad side - they 're fourth in @entity8 and real contenders for promotion to the second tier of @entity13 football - but the might of @entity1 should have brushed them aside with ease			1
@entity16 should have brushed them aside with ease			2
@entity0 took the lead just after half - time , and they were in with a real chance of progressing to the quarter - finals of the @entity23 until @entity24 got the ball rolling , and @entity26 put them ahead			1
@entity16 has abuse hurled at him by @entity0 fans as he makes his way off the pitch to be substituted @entity33 ( right ) replaced @entity16 after an hour of the match - the @entity32 did not make an impact @entity26 ( right ) , who scored @entity1 's second , shrugs his shoulders at his team - mate @entity39 and @entity1 have a big decision to make regarding the future of the @entity32 - he will cost them £ 43million if they decide to make his loan a permanent deal - and if monday night is anything to go by , he does n't seem worthy of the mega-bucks he is currently being paid			1
on 60 minutes , with @entity0 leading 1 - 0 , @entity16 was hauled off in place of @entity33			1
one hour , zero goals , zero shots			0
there have been flashes since he made his @entity52 debut in september			0
four goals , a handful of decent performances , and a brief sign of what he could bring to the @entity59			0
there are rumours that he 's unhappy with life at @entity1 ; his agent @entity64 took a swipe at @entity39 last week , claiming that @entity16 would 've been better under the stewardship of sir @entity67			1
@entity16 's heat map shows the story of his match - the @entity32 striker hardly made an impact the 29 - year - old touches vs @entity0 are shown ( left ) while his stats ( right ) show zero shots in the entire match ' @entity16 is a champion , ' @entity64 said			1
' recently he was being the best player of the match and after 70 minutes ... there are things i do n't want to discuss further			2
' @entity64 refers to his substitution , much like the scenario he faced after an hour against @entity0 on monday night			2
except he was far from the best player on the pitch on this occasion			0
@entity16 looked bemused as the fourth official held up a big red no 9 , as though he did n't expect a change			1
as though @entity1 were n't 1 - 0 down against @entity8 opposition with half an hour remaining			0
@entity91 columnist and former @entity93 and @entity94 defender @entity90 , who was commentating on the match for the @entity96 , said : ' i wonder if we 'll ever see him again in a @entity1 shirt			0
he 's offered nothing to his team tonight			0
' @entity102 ( right ) and @entity16 watch on as they wait to kick off in the @entity23 against @entity0 @entity3 shakes @entity16 's hand after he is substituted - the @entity1 manager has a big decision to make the 29 - year - old was left out of @entity39 's squad to face @entity109 in january - he 's not immune to exclusion - and it would n't be a surprise if @entity113 gets the nod instead of him come the weekend , when @entity1 travel to @entity116			1
there are 13 @entity59 matches left of the season , before @entity16 's future is decided			1
it 's a gamble whichever way @entity1 decide to go			2
there is certainly talent there ; @entity16 has more than proved that in his successful career to date , at @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129			0
but it just is n't working for him in @entity94			0
these things take time , but time , and £ 43m , might be luxuries @entity1 are n't willing to afford .			0

@entity16 played an hour against @entity0 , but did n't have a shot
he was substituted after failing to make an impact in the @entity23 match
@entity3 has a big decision to make over the @entity32 's future
it will cost £ 43million if they decide to keep him , and it is a huge gamble
