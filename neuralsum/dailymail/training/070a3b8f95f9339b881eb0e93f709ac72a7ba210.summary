@entity0 has taken another jibe at president @entity2 - this time mocking his ' coffee cup ' salute			1
the commander - in - chief was criticized after @entity7 officials posted a video of him stepping off of @entity9 in @entity10 and saluting waiting @entity11 while still holding a white cup			1
in response @entity0 , speaking at the @entity13 in @entity14 , said : ' to the commander - in - chief , we then salute him , ' before sarcastically waving the @entity19 cup over her head			1
however she soon became the victim of embarrassment herself when she said the @entity7 is located at ' 1400 @entity23			1
' it is actually at 1600			2
she wrote : ' doggone it			0
that explains why my @entity46 cards keeps ( sic ) getting returned			0
' @entity0 then visited wrong address she had mentioned in the slip up and sent a photo underneath the street sign to @entity54 reporter @entity53			2
saluting military personnel is something presidents are expected to do since they 're at the top of the @entity60 's chain of command			0
after realizing that she had got the address of the @entity7 wrong , @entity0 tried to poke fun at herself @entity2 caused a stir because it is customary for a commander - in - chief to salute uniformed servicemen and women who salute him first as a sign of respect			1
many people took to @entity42 criticizing his controversial method while @entity74 said it was ' terrible '			0
president @entity78 reportedly began the tradition and future presidents , both @entity76 and @entity77 , followed suit			0
@entity9 lands at a heliport in @entity10 ahead of a @entity35 summit - moments later the president was captured giving a salute while holding a coffee cup to waiting @entity11 @entity2 's casual approach to the moment as he left his @entity9 chopper at a helipad in @entity10 came at a time when he had just ordered @entity94 fighter planes to fly perilous missions in the skies over @entity97			1
@entity42 predictably erupted , with most commenters expressing outrage			0
before the cup gesture and subsequent gaffe at the summit , @entity0 was asked questions about recent photos that were taken of her without her wedding ring			2
she denied her and her husband @entity107 were on the verge of divorce and added : ' well , i rarely wear a ring , especially up in @entity112 , you know it 's choppin ' wood or you 're butcherin ' a moose or something			0
' ' terrible ' : @entity74 was one of the people to have criticized the president 's actions on @entity42 the 2008 @entity76 vice presidential nominee playfully confronted the issue on her own accord friday afternoon , saying midway through her speech , ' i heard the other day that i 'm in the middle of another divorce			1
' @entity0 did n't talk about the media coverage of the drunken brawl her family recently got into in @entity112 during which her daughter @entity134 allegedly punched a man in the face , her son track broke four ribs and her husband @entity107 bloodied his nose			2
instead , she used the divorce chatter as a bridge into a lengthier rant on the mainsteam media and the perceived bias against conservatives .			0
