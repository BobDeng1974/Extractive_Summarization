by @entity0 if the prisoner was trying to wind up the police officer who was driving him to a custody cell 50 miles away , he succeeded – spectacularly			1
for after being repeatedly asked how fast the high - performance police car would go , pc @entity5 put his foot down – and drove at speeds of up to 140mph			2
but when he delivered the suspect to their destination , the prisoner reported him to the desk officer			2
caught : the @entity16 's 140mph speeding was reported by his criminal passenger when the pair arrived at @entity19 ( pictured ) now @entity20 has been stripped of driving duties and a row has broken out after senior officers said he would not be prosecuted despite the offence ordinarily carrying a driving ban			1
the constable from @entity27 was driving the prisoner , who had been arrested on suspicion of theft , from @entity30 back to @entity19 in a marked police @entity31 330			1
in trouble : the driver sped for part of the journey between @entity30 and @entity19 and the prisoner promptly informed a custody officer when he arrived a source said : ‘ the conversation turned to the vehicle they were travelling in			1
apparently the prisoner asked how fast it would go and the officer said something along the lines of , “ i ’ll show you ” , or , “ let ’s see ”			1
as soon as they got back to @entity19 , the prisoner proceeded to tell the officer at the custody desk just how fast they had been going			2
’ road safety campaigners condemned the decision not to prosecute			0
the law allows police , ambulance and fire service drivers to exceed the speed limit , but only in emergencies			0
@entity61 , from the charity brake , said : ‘ driving at very high speeds on public roads poses a horrendous danger , so anyone caught driving in this reckless way should face appropriately stiff penalties			0
’ yesterday supt @entity69 , head of professional standards at @entity27 , said the officer had been removed from road policing			1
he added : ‘ after a thorough internal investigation the force has taken appropriate action			0
‘ the officer was an advanced and highly skilled police driver and there was no suggestion the vehicle was driven dangerously at any time			2
the officer ’s conduct prior to the incident had been exemplary			0
’ he will not return to full operational duties until it is deemed appropriate			0
the case had also been referred to the @entity87 for consideration .			0
