@entity1 's 2 - 0 defeat by @entity2 on tuesday brought back bitter memories of their disastrous @entity4 , but coach @entity6 will not be too worried about a third straight friendly defeat , insists @entity8			1
@entity2 , whose 5 - 1 drubbing of @entity1 in the group stage in @entity11 last year marked the end of the @entity15 nation 's six - year domination of the world game , scored two early goals at the @entity18 and held on against some determined @entity1 pressure in the second half for a 2 - 0 success			1
they became the first team to inflict two defeats on @entity6 since he took over in 2008 but the gruff 64 - year - old had used the match to try out several new faces and he fielded a largely experimental , second - string team			2
