by @entity0 despite experiencing a ' baptism of fire ' in charge of @entity4 , @entity1 says he only has his mind on managing again after this season			1
the 38 - year - old will leave the club at the end of the season having failed to impress @entity11 after @entity13 ' sacking in december			2
and @entity1 admits he ' could n't do without ' management , playing down reports of a future as an assistant			1
' it 's been an honour to manage this great football @entity32 's been different , it 's an an experience like no other			2
' ' unless you 've ever stood in that technical area and had the expectation of the whole football club then you do n't really know what it 's like to be a manager			2
' i 've enjoyed it and perversely i 've enjoyed the pressure			2
i 'm not sure i could do without it now			0
' as well as denying he had talks over a no 2 role , he also rejected claims he would be interested in the @entity51 job , calling it disrespectful			2
@entity4 travel to play @entity19 this weekend , and despite the hosts needing points to secure their @entity56 survival , @entity1 insists the match is just as important for his side			1
' any other club 's need ca n't be greater than ours			0
we 've got five cup finals left and i think we can take maximum points from those games			0
' playmaker : the victory against the @entity25 , inspired by @entity68 , helped @entity4 regain some form big game : they face @entity19 at the weekend , a team who are fighting for their lives at the bottom one worry for @entity4 , and possibly @entity77 , is the fitness of @entity79			1
the right - back has been out of action in recent weeks with a pelvic problem , and his manager says that although the injury is worrying , he is sure he will still make the plane to @entity86 to play in the @entity87 this summer			1
' we 're concerned immediately because he 's not fit and it would be very doubtful if he were fit for next week			0
' he 's still got a lot of time before the @entity87 and @entity79 is one of the best right backs - i 'm sure he 'll be on the plane even if he does n't make an appearance for @entity4 before the end of the season			1
' fight against time : @entity79 is no nearer to making a comeback with his @entity87 dream now in doubt @entity101 is the favourite to be made the next permanent manager at @entity104 , but @entity1 has been consistent in refusing to talk about the future of the club			1
' it 's just about me concentrating on the game and today i 'm concentrating on the game tomorrow			0
i think those questions are not for me to answer			0
its just for me to worry about football matches and hopefully trying to win the next five games for @entity4			1
' that will iron itself out in due course			0
for me to worry about preparing the team , like i 've done this week			0
we had a good week 's training and we 're really going to @entity19 on the front foot and trying to entertain those great @entity4 fans and get three points			1
' the speculation has never eased since i came in			0
i 've always fended off the questions			0
i do n't see a difference from the first hour to now			0
' summer switch ? @entity1 refused to comment on speculation about @entity101			1

@entity1 admits he has caught the management bug at @entity4
@entity79 is still injured - a doubt for the @entity87
@entity1 blasts managers for talking about his job
