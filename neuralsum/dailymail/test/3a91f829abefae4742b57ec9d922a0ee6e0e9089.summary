@entity0 has been crowned the winner of @entity2 2015 , after beating fellow contestant @entity3 in the final			1
now mentor @entity5 , his fellow celebrity judges @entity6 , @entity8 and @entity9 , and most of all bosses at the @entity12 will all have their fingers crossed for his success			2
because it 's not just a hit single @entity17 needs , he also has to break the curse of previous winners who have failed to do anything but flop out of the charts			2
the very job she was hoping to leave behind when first auditioning for the show series one winner @entity30 , mentored to success in 2012 by sir @entity8 , blew everyone away with her version of @entity40 's i would run to you in the live final			1
but despite much excitement surrounding her first single , she failed to rank any higher than number 45 in the music charts			0
then a year later came her album , a record of songs written entirely by her rather than a compilation of cover versions , which failed to chart in the top 100			0
some , including the script frontman and former @entity2 coach @entity53 , believe @entity30 did n't have the right work ethic			1
when asked last year about @entity30 's flop , he said , ' i was told by @entity8 , and by the label as well , that @entity30 just did not want to work as hard as you have to work to be a pop star			1
' @entity30 won the public vote in the final of @entity2 @entity24 's first ever series , but her debut single , a cover of @entity40 's i would run to you only just managed to scrape into the top 50 after being released @entity30 has now returned to her previous employment , singing for holiday campers at @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity71 , after failing to make her mark on the music industry after being dropped by her label @entity75 , @entity30 is now working in the job she thought she 'd left behind - singing for holiday campers at @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity71			1
the singer has defended her efforts , suggesting that she was given poor advice and not enough support once she 'd finished writing her album			0
but can the same be said for series two winner , @entity83 ? former @entity2 @entity24 coach @entity53 criticised @entity30 for not working hard enough after winning series one of the @entity12 talent show , but has failed to make his own winning act , @entity83 , who was crowned champion of the second series in 2013 , into a household name either partially sighted @entity92 singer @entity83 was determined to avoid the mistakes of her predecessor @entity30 , but despite enjoying more chart success amd holding onto her record deal , she too has failed to equal the superstardom that comes with winning other tv talent shows like @entity100 's @entity99 the partially sighted singer from @entity102 , @entity103 , now 29 , won the public vote in 2013 after being mentored by fellow @entity105 , @entity53			1
she even commented on the failings of her predecessor @entity30 , and said that she was determined to do things differently			2
' everybody is obviously aware that last year things did n't go maybe as well as they could 've done , and i think lessons have been learned , ' she told the @entity112 , shortly after being crowned champ			0
@entity83 's album , @entity115 , released in october 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts , but compare that to the success of most x factor winners , and you soon understand the singer 's disappointment but while @entity83 is still fortunate enough to have herself a record deal , her success has n't been the chart topping megastardom that winning a rival show like @entity99 might bring			1
her debut single , a cover of @entity132 's @entity131 , charted at number 30 , while her follow up , @entity135 , originally by @entity129 , did n't make it any further than 113			0
@entity83 's album , @entity115 , released in october 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts , but compare that to the success of most x factor winners , and you soon understand the deflation in the @entity83 camp			1
@entity9 won the third series of @entity2 @entity24 with @entity144 , a young singer from @entity145 , @entity146 2014 @entity2 winner @entity147 saw his debut single and i am telling you , a cover of the @entity153 number made famous by @entity154 in musical dreamgirls , chart at just number 75 hot on the heels of @entity83 was @entity144 , who won last year 's series with coach @entity9			1
if a slow start killed @entity30 's chances , @entity147 and @entity159 had better kick this career into gear			2
the singer from @entity145 in @entity146 , still just 20 - years - old , saw his debut single and i am telling you , a cover of the @entity153 number made famous by @entity154 in musical dreamgirls , chart at number 75			0
despite various public appearances , once with @entity170 at a charity event in the name of his late daughter @entity170 , @entity147 's debut album this month has landed at number 42			0
compared with @entity99 's 2014 winner @entity177 , whose debut single landed the @entity179 number one spot , @entity147 's success has so far been what you could call limited			2
compared with @entity99 's 2014 winner @entity177 , whose debut single landed the @entity179 number one spot , @entity147 's success has so far been what you could call limited despite various public appearances , once with @entity170 ( pictured centre ) at a charity event in the name of his late daughter @entity170 , @entity147 's debut album this month has landed at number 42 the glitter falls from the ceiling ... but the real hard work is just beginning for @entity0 so can @entity0 break the curse and become the first ever success of @entity2 @entity24 ? his debut single will be lost stars , a cover of @entity199 's hit from the film @entity201 , which was nominated for an @entity202 this year			1
the @entity203 has also reportedly been asked to perform at music festival @entity204 already			0
@entity17 's coach @entity5 , frontman of rock band @entity205 , has been quick to defend his protege in the face of criticism			2
when asked if he 's worried about the growing number of @entity2 @entity24 flops , he simply replied , ' @entity17 has n't won it before			1
' so now it 's all eyes on you @entity17 ! no pressure ... though it 's not always the winners who reap all the success ( @entity218 , case in point ) , the @entity99 has produced far more chart successes than @entity2 @entity24			1
here are just a few of the best - selling artists that came from @entity100 's @entity226 show : one direction they did n't win , in fact they came third , runners up next to @entity230 and @entity231 in 2010 , but @entity100 's boyband has sold over 50 million albums and quite literally , taken over the world with their legion of fans			0
@entity237 despite having left @entity100 's label @entity238 last year , @entity237 remains one of the show 's biggest successes , having sold over 4.4 million singles off the back of her 2006 win			0
@entity246 the runners - up of the 2009 series , @entity246 went on to sell over 3.9 million singles and 2.7 million albums , before splitting up in 2013			0
@entity252 he came second to @entity253 in 2009 , then went on to sell almost as many albums as @entity246 and co-present the @entity99 's sister show @entity255 in @entity257 with @entity258			0
@entity262 after winning the 2009 series following her duet with @entity261 , @entity259 went on to rack up more than 1.25 million sales for her debut single @entity264			0
@entity265 before the singer landed himself in hot water with volatile @entity269 rants , he clocked up over 1.2 million sales of his first single impossible after winning the 2012 series			0
@entity273 the first ever group to win the show in 2011 , @entity273 have now beaten @entity277 ' chart success in @entity278 and raked up an impressive 132million @entity280 views			1
@entity281 she came second to @entity230 in the 2010 series , @entity231 has just released her third album @entity284 and has enjoyed steady chart success .			2

@entity30 has been dropped by her label and sings at a holiday camp
@entity83 and @entity144 are yet to become household names
will 2015 winner @entity17 become a chart success or another @entity2 flop ?
