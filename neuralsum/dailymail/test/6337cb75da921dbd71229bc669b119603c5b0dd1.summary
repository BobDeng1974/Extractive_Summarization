a controversial @entity2 advocacy group known for publicly criticizing @entity3 can display its political advertisement containing the phrase ' @entity6 is worship ' on @entity8 's buses , a judge ruled this week			1
judge @entity9 said in a decision made public tuesday that the incendiary ad is speech protected under the @entity13			1
he said he was sensitive to the @entity15 's claim that the poster could incite violence and appreciates the efforts necessary to prevent violent attacks targeting @entity21 people			1
@entity22 1 , @entity15 0 : a federal judge has ordered the @entity15 to run on its buses anti-islam ads featuring the phrase ' @entity6 is worship ' created by the @entity2 lobby @entity27 but he noted that substantially the same advertisement ran in @entity29 and @entity30 in 2013 without incident			1
he added that examples of violent attacks cited by the @entity15 show that individuals may commit heinous acts without warning			2
@entity9 also noted that the @entity15 and chairman @entity37 ' underestimate the tolerant quality of @entity8 and overestimate the potential impact of these fleeting advertisements			1
' ' under the @entity13 , the fear of such spontaneous attacks , without more , can not override individuals ' rights to freedom of expression , ' @entity9 said in a ruling dated monday			0
he delayed enforcing his order to run the ads by a month so it can be appealed			0
@entity15 spokesman @entity50 said the agency is disappointed in the ruling and is preparing a response			2
it came in a lawsuit filed last year by the @entity27 , an organization headed by firebrand blogger @entity56 that 's behind the advertisement			1
@entity58 , a lawyer for the organization , said the decision ' sends a strong message both to government bureaucrats who would restrict our freedom of speech based upon what they perceive to be a global jihadist threat , and it also sends a telling message to our enemies abroad and at home : their threats of violence will not prevent the courts from upholding the @entity13			2
' the lawsuit said @entity56 's group buys the advertisements to express its message on current events and public issues ' including issues such as @entity3 's hatred of @entity21			2
' an ad from the @entity82 is seen on an articulated @entity84 ( @entity84 ) bus featuring a 1941 photograph of @entity86 and supporter @entity87 , a @entity90 @entity89 nationalist , wednesday , april 1 , 2015 , in @entity91 the lawsuit was filed after the @entity15 notified the group in august that it would display three of four proposed posters but not an ad with the quote ' killing @entity21 is worship that draws us close to @entity99 ' because it could incite violence			1
in the ad , a man 's menacing face wrapped with a checkered scarf is shown next to the quote , which is attributed to " @entity106			0
" it is followed by the words : ' that 's his @entity110			0
what 's yours ? ' it also includes a disclaimer that the ad 's display does not imply the @entity15 's endorsement of its views			2
the @entity15 , whose buses and subways have been forums for policy debates , has accepted other ads from the @entity27			1
in september 2012 , subway stations in @entity8 featured @entity22 posters that read : ' in any war between the civilized man and the savage , support the civilized man			2
' two years later , @entity56 's group agreed to pull an ad from the subway system showing captive journalist @entity135 with the masked militant who decapitated him in the moment before the beheading			0
in a september statement , the @entity15 said it recognized that the ' @entity6 ' ad was a parody of ' @entity143 ' ads sponsored by the @entity144 , which said it was promoting the concept that jihad is an individual and personal struggle rather than a violent conflict or terrorism			1
@entity9 said he recognized that the @entity15 believes it would be far more difficult to counter the advertisement because it has parodic aspects			0
past ads : a man stands next to ad in the @entity155 saying : ' in any war between the civilized man and the savage , support the civilized man			0
defeat @entity110 ' in @entity8 on september 24 , 2012 but he said he believes the agency underestimates ' the power of counter-advertisements to explain that the @entity15 does not endorse the ad and that the ad is not to be taken seriously			1
' @entity164 , a spokeswoman for mayor @entity165 , noted in a statement that the mayor has said ' these anti-islamic ads are outrageous , inflammatory and wrong , and have no place in @entity8 , or anywhere			0
' ' these hateful messages serve only to divide and stigmatize when we should be coming together as one city , ' she added			0
' while those behind these ads only display their irresponsible intolerance , the rest of us who may be forced to view them can take comfort in the knowledge that we share a better , loftier and nobler view of humanity			0
' @entity187 : right - wing blogger @entity56 is one of the founders of the controversial group behind the anti-islam ads			0
