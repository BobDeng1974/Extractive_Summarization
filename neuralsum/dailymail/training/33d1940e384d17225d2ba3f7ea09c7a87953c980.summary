by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 11:28 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 02:17 est , 24 october 2012 one of the main architects of the poll tax has warned ministers they are in line for similar chaos over controversial plans to impose council tax on thousands for the first time			1
@entity12 peer @entity10 , who helped design @entity14 ’s doomed community charge , said plans to cut council tax benefit would hit the pockets of the working poor – just the sort of people for whom the @entity20 has pledged to make work pay			1
experts said last night that cuts to the benefit meant that up to 750,000 people – most of them working people on low wages – could be forced to pay council tax for the first time , or will have to pay more			1
the introduction of the @entity30 in 1990 sparked riots , including violence in @entity33			0
lord @entity10 said the government should brace itself for a ' backlash ' to new changes to council tax in addition , thousands of middle class people could lose out because some local authorities are scrapping discounts on second homes in response to the reforms , which come into effect next april			1
lord @entity10 told the @entity46 that the government needed to be braced for a ‘ backlash ’ over the complicated changes to council tax benefit , which is paid to 5.9million people			1
the warning comes just a day after accountants said another set of changes – this time to child benefit – could also lead to chaos because the reforms are too complex for parents to understand			2
the latest potential chaos arises from a double whammy in the way the reforms are being introduced			0
first , ministers have slashed the fund for council tax benefit by 10 per cent , around £ 500million			1
second , they have scrapped the running of the benefit as a national scheme – meaning each council in @entity71 will decide who gets the handout for the first time			2
councils will therefore have to decide whether to cut the amount of benefit paid , to cut services , or try to fill the funding gap by scrapping 50 per cent discounts for second homes and empty properties			0
authorities are not being allowed to reduce benefit for pensioners or to change the 25 per cent discount for single households			0
some town halls have even gone as far as charging double the standard rate of council tax on empty and second homes – meaning that both the working poor and the middle classes are being affected			1
lord @entity10 was environment secretary under @entity14 and was responsible for the poll tax lord @entity10 told @entity93 ’s @entity94 that the @entity95 were making the same mistakes over council tax benefit as they made over the ill - fated poll tax , which sparked riots in @entity100 and was a factor in the downfall of @entity14			1
‘ the poll tax was introduced with the proposition that everyone should pay something , and with the present structure of society it does n’t work , ’ he said			2
‘ we got it wrong			0
‘ the same factor will apply here , that there will be large numbers of fairly poor households who have hitherto been protected from council tax , who are going to be asked to pay small sums			1
’ he said many of those being hit would be ‘ pretty vulnerable households ’ , adding : ‘ i think the @entity124 has taken a fairly brusque view of this all the way along			0
’ @entity127 , a local government expert at the @entity128 , said figures from the @entity130 implied that around 750,000 would be affected by council tax benefit cuts			1
he said : ‘ this could be a slow - burn political issue			0
like @entity136 ’s 10p tax rate , the impact will not be felt until people receive their bills in april and feel the pain			2
[ must keep some of this ]			0
‘ it affects the same group of people , those who are working but do not earn much – the group that all politicians want to get into work and stay there			0
‘ one of the knock - out consequences is that councils are having to come up with other savings , and those with second homes are a target			0
there will be a large number of losers			0
ministers should fiddle with council tax at their peril			2
’ @entity160 , @entity161 's communities spokesman , said : ‘ when the architect of @entity14 ’s poll tax – which contributed to her downfall – tells @entity166 that he 's making the same mistake , it ’s time for the government to sit up and listen			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity171 said : ‘ spending on council tax benefit doubled under the last administration and welfare reform is vital to tackle the budget deficit we have inherited			1

benefit changes mean 750,000 people could be forced to pay council tax for the first time
