@entity1 chief @entity0 has admitted he is relieved bad boy @entity2 has departed @entity4 football			1
the @entity6 striker left @entity7 for @entity8 earlier this summer in a £ 75million deal , bringing an end to his eventful three - year spell on these shores			1
the @entity31 was found guilty of racially abusing then - @entity33 defender @entity32 , banned for 10 matches after biting @entity36 ’s @entity35 and was regularly accused of diving			1
the ugly side of his game reared its head again during the @entity41 when he bit @entity43 defender @entity42 — the third time in his career he has been found guilty of such an offence			1
disgrace : @entity2 ( left ) was given an eight - match ban for racially abusing @entity32 ( right ) in 2011 @entity48 : @entity2 ( top left ) was slapped with a 10 - match ban for biting @entity35 ( top centre ) in 2013 hungry ? @entity2 ( left ) is currently banned from football for four months after biting @entity42 ( right ) @entity2 will find out on thursday whether his appeal to the @entity55 against his four - month football ban for biting @entity42 ’s shoulder is successful			1
whatever the outcome , the top - flight ’s chief executive is glad to see the back of the striker			2
‘ i do n’t think his departure hurts the @entity1 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he is an undeniable , world - class talent , but there comes a point when you just ca n’t go on defending the indefensible			2
@entity68 's best : @entity69 is one of the @entity1 's stars to have moved to @entity71 in the past on the ball : @entity73 left @entity74 to join @entity75 for a world record £ 86million fee last summer ‘ therefore the risk of something happening , whether it be this season or next season , is so high that you just say : “ actually , thank you very much			1
it was great to have you while we had you			2
but you ’re not worth the risk ”			0
‘ he ’s great to have but an accident waiting to happen			0
he ’s done his time here , but i ca n’t say i ’m sorry to see him go			0
‘ we wo n’t miss him because there is only so long we can go on defending the indefensible			0
’ @entity0 ’s comments came at the official launch of the new @entity1 season			1
it was the first time the 55 - year - old has spoken publicly since sexist emails from his account were leaked to a national newspaper and nearly cost him his job earlier this year			1
@entity0 has since apologised and insisted the organisation does not have a sexism problem			2
tough competition : @entity103 ( left ) and @entity104 ( right ) will be challenging for the @entity1 title @entity103 keen to push on ‘ there is not a sexist culture in the @entity1 , i think we can be absolutely sure of that , ’ he said			2
‘ nearly 50 per cent of our employers are female			0
every single one of them — and believe you me people were trying to goad one of them to “ dob ” on the culture of the @entity1 — will say it ’s a very invigorating place to work			2
there ’s some very aggrieved female employees who have seen the organisation characterised in the way it was			0
of course , it was difficult and i apologised straight away			0
‘ the clubs were assembled and they gave me their backing unanimously			0
i ca n’t say more than that , they were private emails and there is a legal process that is going on so i ca n’t say more			0
’ @entity0 also reiterated his intention to introduce a ‘ 39th @entity1 game ’			1
the notion of playing an extra round of fixtures abroad was first mooted in 2008 but was heavily criticised			0
‘ i thought it was a good idea ( back then ) , and i still think it ’s a good idea now , ’ he added			0

@entity0 is *n't* sad to see @entity2 leave the @entity1
@entity2 joined @entity8 for £ 75million from @entity7 in july
@entity6 *international* scored 31 league goals for the @entity146 last season
striker endured a controversial three - and - a - half seasons at @entity28
*27* - year - old was found guilty of racially abusing @entity32 in *october* 2011
*mercurial* talent was also charged for biting @entity35 in april 2013
@entity0 says @entity2 's antics reflected badly on the @entity1
