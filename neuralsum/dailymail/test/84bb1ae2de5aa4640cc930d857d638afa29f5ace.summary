the 60 - year - old , whose daughter is a former @entity18 contestant , sent a text to a relative shortly before the crash on august 20 last year saying : ' i 'm in a plane out of control and it 's going down			1
' an investigation by the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) said the message was ' unusual ' as the leased plane did not enter a spin until after it was sent			1
the experienced pilot had also tried to call the same relative before writing 148 characters within 25 seconds in a text - something the @entity27 said would require ' considerable dexterity '			1
the report said : ' the pilot had accumulated considerable experience in a variety of aircraft in the years that he had been flying			2
he was familiar with the @entity12 aircraft and was in recent flying practice			1
' it was suggested in his final text message that he had lost control of the aircraft , to such an extent that he did not expect to survive			1
' however , after this message was sent , the aircraft continued in flight for more than two minutes , before entering a spin from which it did not recover			2
' investigators found no fault with the aircraft and said weather conditions were unlikely to have caused the crash			0
mr @entity0 , of @entity57 , @entity58 , had previously undertaken aerobatic training , meaning he ' would have recognised , and been able to recover from , a spin ' , according to the @entity27			1
the investigation also revealed the father - of - two had not booked a final destination for the fatal flight			1

his @entity12 aircraft plummeted into a field near @entity14 in @entity15 in august last year the pilot had written a 148 character text within 25 seconds - something the @entity27 said would require ' considerable dexterity especially in an aircraft that may have been out of control ' ms @entity71 , who is married with an 18 - month - old daughter , is now a yoga teacher and continues to sing after previously hosting an online news and gossip series on website @entity94 , created by will.i.am			1
his brother was the former @entity99 race advisor @entity97 , who entertained mrs @entity6 at her multi-million pound home in @entity101 in 2004			1
in 1995 , a jury at the @entity1 convicted him of seven charges of fraudulent trading , obtaining property and services by deception and making false statements to obtain bank facilities			0
on the day of the crash , mr @entity0 had flown the @entity12 from @entity111 , @entity112 , to @entity113 before heading on to @entity114 near @entity115 , @entity116			1
he was then due to return to @entity111 , but at 4.55pm mr @entity0 telephoned the aerodrome to say he would not be returning that day and did not book an alternative destination			2
the plane took off from @entity114 shortly after 5pm , heading north , and when he was just south of @entity120 , he began to fly in a circle for almost an hour at between 2,500ft and 4,700ft			2
his daughter @entity71 ( far right ) came fifth in the 2007 series of the @entity124 with girl band @entity72 it was at this time he made a number of calls on his mobile telephone and at 6.31pm he unsuccessfully tried to call the relative who he then sent the final text to			1
investigators suggested that two minutes later he still had ' at least control of lateral flight '			0
the aircraft then turned to the left as the pilot sent out a ' @entity139 ' distress call , saying : ' lost control of the aircraft and it 's gone into a spin			0
' mr @entity0 then confirmed his location to the controller before saying : ' i ca n't control it			2
' mr @entity0 's brother was former government race advisor , @entity97 , who entertained mrs @entity6 at her multi-million pound home in @entity101 in 2004 the @entity27 report said : ' it was apparent , from the witness accounts and the on - site evidence , that the aircraft had entered a spin from which it did not recover			1
' the time elapsed during the pilot 's final radio transmissions , together with the rate of descent deduced from the @entity160 videos , suggested that the spin was likely to have started from a minimum height of 2,500ft , and probably higher			0
' the report also highlighted strange aspects of mr @entity0 's behaviour on the day , although people who spoke to him said he appeared ' chatty , friendly and relaxed '			0
investigators wrote : ' there were a number of events which took place in the course of the afternoon which represented unusual actions on the part of the pilot			0
' it appears the pilot made a change of intended destination prior to leaving @entity114			0
' having booked out for @entity111 he subsequently called them to advise he would not be returning there			0
he did not book out to any other destination			0
' after departing @entity114 and flying north for about half an hour , he flew in a large circular pattern for almost an hour			0
' although somewhat unusual , this may be explained by the need to re-charge the aircraft battery			0
' mr @entity0 , who had more than 3,000 hours of flying experience , died instantly in the crash and a post-mortem examination carried out on his body revealed he died as a result of multiple injuries			2
a date has not been set for an inquest but it is likely to take place in may with a jury .			0
