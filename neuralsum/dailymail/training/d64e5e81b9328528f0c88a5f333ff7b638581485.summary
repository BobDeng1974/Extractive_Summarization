so @entity0 was sitting at home in @entity2 when he suddenly remembered that he had , after all , bitten @entity3			1
well , these things can slip one ’s mind			1
who has n’t , at a busy moment , forgotten sinking their teeth into another human being ? who has n’t been innocently enjoying a cup of tea , only to be hit by the realisation : ‘ did n’t i bite that bloke in the queue at @entity18 last thursday ? ’ slap of the head , roll of the eyes			1
so that ’s what all the fuss was about with the police and the sirens and the handcuffs			1
there he was , being bundled out of the @entity44 , banned from football for four months , and all the time racking his brains			2
why me ? what have i done ? and then the penny drops			2
‘ @entity51 me , ’ he exclaims , a mere six days later			2
‘ it must have been that bite			2
the one i said was a complete accident , when i fell with my mouth open , landed on some chap ’s shoulder and hurt my teeth			2
' now i come to think of it - i did do it on purpose			2
just like i bit that other bloke , and the one before			2
what a silly old sausage i ’ve been			0
’ there is , of course , another explanation : but one would have to be a real cynic , or an @entity70 journalist , to go there			0
@entity0 is still at home in @entity2 but in this scenario the telephone rings			1
he has been speaking to @entity37			1
suspension : @entity0 was banned for four months after appearing to bite @entity32 defender @entity3 apparently , they are reluctant to pay in the region of £ 80million for a player who goes around chomping on people and then behaving as if he is the victim of a terrible conspiracy			1
they think it might be bad for their business			0
if they are to pursue a transfer this summer , a slate needs to be wiped clean			0
facts have to be faced			0
responsibility has to be taken			0
say sorry , or no deal			0
this would be why , almost a week after the event , @entity0 has acknowledged what the world — beyond @entity39 - knew all along			1
he committed a deliberately aggravated assault on an opponent , for the third occasion in his career			0
he promises it will never happen again			0
painful : @entity0 fell to the ground and held his teeth straight after the encounter with centre back @entity3 had that been his attitude last tuesday it would have been more impressive , for it would have shown the remorse @entity110 found so disturbingly absent from his statements after the game			1
instead , @entity0 was allowed to pose as the wounded party , abetted by his coach @entity114 , whose resignation from @entity110 ’s technical committee now looks appallingly misguided , his captain @entity117 , team - mates , national association and his nation ’s fawning media			1
it also means he submitted evidence we now know was a lie , given his contrary admission since			0
sadly , the sequence of events makes it impossible to take these latest words at face value			0
if they were sincere , why were they not said sooner ? if he knows he did wrong now , why not then ? the biter is opportunistic , and so is the man			0
about time : @entity0 has delayed his apology to @entity3 but has promised he will never behave like that again given a pathetically easy ride by those in his camp , @entity0 took the opportunity to remain in denial about his behaviour			1
he retreated behind a wall of risible counter-claim and victimhood , and was indulged			0
dragged from this position by the reality of the global view , and football ’s marketplace , he at last delivers truth			0
the apology will be accepted no doubt but , given the timing , what is it really worth ? the conclusion is plain			1
@entity0 will not bite anyone again : and if @entity37 hand over £ 80m he will surely prove it			1

@entity0 has finally said sorry for biting @entity32 defender @entity3
@entity39 frontman 's apology comes after receiving four month ban
@entity37 have been linked with an £ 80million move for @entity171 *attacker*
