the man who produced the thank you note that brought down a @entity4 premier has revealed how it almost did not happen			2
@entity8 ( @entity7 ) chief @entity6 said he had contemplated burning the note after premier @entity10 denied he had received a $ 3,000 bottle of @entity12 from mr @entity6 who has links with the family of @entity15 , a corrupt former politician			1
mr @entity10 was appearing as a witness before the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) on april 15			1
former chief of @entity19 was the man who brought down the premier with a thank you note for a bottle of wine while giving evidence , mr @entity10 said he and his wife @entity26 had been on holidays in april 2011 when it was asserted the wine had been delivered to their @entity31 home on @entity34 's north shore			1
but the @entity17 traced a telephone call from mr @entity10 to mr @entity36 around that time			1
on the same night mr @entity10 took the stand , mr @entity6 found a note penned in 2011 by the then - premier thanking him and his wife , @entity40 , for the bottle of wine			1
in his home office , the businessman contemplated whether or not he would burn the note or front up and hand it over to his legal team			0
' it would have been illegal , but at that moment i was not thinking like a lawyer , ' mr @entity6 told @entity51			2
' i was all over the place			0
' i knew it was a perversion of justice , and still there was a small voice in my head asking , " should we have a bonfire session ? " ' mr @entity10 ( left ) says he does not recall receiving the $ 3000 bottle of wine ( right ) - a @entity61 - from mr @entity36 after mulling it over - and despite the consequences he would later face for dobbing in the premier - he knew what he had to do			1
the next day mr @entity10 's lawyers received a copy of the note mr @entity6 had found and within hours @entity4 's most powerful man resigned from his post			1
he also revealed he had received death threats on march 18 and 23 , which was the first week of the @entity17 hearing , according to @entity51			2
in one of the calls , someone called from a blocked phone number while he was at home , saying : ' you 're dead , you piece of shit			0
' @entity82 funeral director @entity81 was charged a few weeks later with using a carriage service to menace / harass / offend			0
despite doing the right thing , mr @entity6 struggles with the decision he made , telling @entity51 he wanted to apologise for the outcome of his discovery			2
' it causes me great angst that i ’ve in any way , shape or form forced the premier to resign , ' he said			0
' i ’ve thought about reaching out			0
i suppose what has stopped me is the fear that i wo n’t get a great reception from the other end			0
' the note was produced to mr @entity6 's lawyers and then given to mr @entity10 on the same day the premier resigned when mr @entity10 tendered his resignation , he said he still did not recall receiving the bottle of wine , but ' he did accept there was a thank you note signed by me '			1
' as someone who believes in accountability and responsibility , i accept the consequences of my actions , ' he told media			0
' the evidence i gave [ at @entity17 ] was evidence to the best of my knowledge			0
' i believed it to be truthful			0
' @entity17 was investigating allegations @entity15 's family covered up their investment in @entity7 when they were trying to win a contract with @entity123 that would have made the @entity124 $ 60 million , according to @entity125 .			1

@entity127 was behind the note that brought down @entity10
he found it on the same day mr @entity10 *claimed* he did not remember receiving the bottle of wine
mr @entity10 made the claim during his appearance as a witness before an @entity17 investigation
' there was a small voice in my head asking , " should we have a bonfire session ? " mr @entity6 said
@entity17 was investigating if @entity15 's family had hid their investment in @entity7 when they were trying to win a contract with @entity123
