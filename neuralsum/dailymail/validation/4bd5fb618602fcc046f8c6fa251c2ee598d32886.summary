in the aftermath of a remarkably freakish @entity3 winner at @entity4 on wednesday night , an unusually animated @entity0 pinched @entity5 hard on the cheek and stared hard in to his eyes as if to say : ' i told you so '			1
the only problem was that @entity5 was n't buying it			0
@entity5 has been at @entity3 for two decades and did n't even crack a smile			1
he knows that football like this will not take his football club where it needs to go			0
not in the long run , anyway			0
@entity5 has seen plenty of late winning goals for @entity3 over the years			1
he has been part of teams that have won when they have n't deserved to , who have somehow grabbed something from games that seemingly had nothing to offer			0
@entity27 fires home the winner for @entity3 to earn his side a valuable three points at @entity31 young peels away in celebration as @entity3 remain on course for a top - four finish despite playing below their best @entity27 runs over to celebrate in front of the @entity3 fans after his late strike at @entity4 @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 are among the @entity3 players to celebrate with @entity27 @entity39 was involved in the build up as his pressure forced the @entity31 defence to panic before @entity46 gifted the chance to @entity27 @entity46 lies on his back in dejection after his error allowed @entity27 to slam home @entity3 's winner against @entity31 @entity3 manager @entity0 reacts to @entity27 's winner by knocking his assistant @entity5 on the cheek ... ... but @entity5 shows absolutely no emotion after @entity27 's winner gave @entity3 a crucial victory in their @entity59 push @entity31 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity46 8 ; @entity60 6.5 , @entity61 6.5 , @entity62 6 , @entity63 5.5 ( @entity64 64 , 6.5 ) ; @entity65 6 , @entity66 6 , @entity67 6 , @entity68 5.5 ( @entity69 81 ) ; @entity70 5.5 ( @entity71 59 ) , @entity72 5 subs not used : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77			1
booked : @entity64 manager : @entity79 @entity3 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity80 6 ; @entity81 6 , @entity82 6 , @entity83 5.5 , @entity84 6 ( @entity40 89 ) ; blind 6 ; @entity85 5 ( @entity86 59 ) , @entity87 6 ( @entity88 82 ) , @entity89 6 , @entity27 5 ; @entity39 6 subs not used : @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94			1
goal : @entity27 89 booked : @entity84 , @entity81 manager : @entity0 referee : @entity98 attendance : 49 , 801 @entity99 was replaced early in the second half by @entity0 who sent @entity101 on his place			1
but the @entity103 had one of his better games for @entity3 and covered plenty of ground on the right wing			1
click here for more brilliant stats and heat maps from @entity112			0
his @entity3 , though , the one that he knows , used to bully teams late in games			2
as his old manager sir @entity120 has admitted , @entity3 teams of yore used to practice scoring late goals in training			2
they won games like this by sheer force of will , belief and personality			0
this @entity3 team , on the other hand , the one with @entity131 's uncertain hand on the tiller , stumbles its way in to opportunities			1
somehow it manages to win despite itself			0
if it continues like this for another two months then it may yet find itself in the @entity59 places come the season 's end			2
at the moment , though , it is hard to see it			0
this , in many ways , was the modern @entity3 at their worst			2
facing a home team devoid of purpose , energy and intelligence , @entity3 really should have taken hold of this game , won it comfortably and used it as a platform ahead of tougher challenges to come			1
instead , they saw @entity31 miss two golden opportunities and wasted their own with inept work in front of goal			1
the home team , meanwhile , were somehow denied a clear early penalty by a referee that we can only presume – generously – was unsighted			2
and then there was the winning goal			2
three points handed to @entity3 on a black and white tray			2
there was no late cavalry charge by @entity3 here			2
they had settled for a point			0
the game was drifting towards a conclusion that had seemed inevitable for so long			0
but then @entity39 's run in to the penalty area was halted by @entity66 , the subsequent back pass sold goalkeeper @entity46 short and when the clearance – born of panic and terror – landed at the feet of @entity27 , the goal waited – empty – just ten yards away			1
@entity87 came close to scoring for @entity3 but he was denied by a brilliant stop from @entity46 @entity27 had a chance to convert the rebound but took too long and was also denied by @entity31 's @entity188 goalkeeper @entity99 was replaced early in the second half by @entity86 as @entity3 struggled to break down a stubborn @entity31 side @entity39 has scored more @entity192 goals against @entity31 than any other club , although he failed to add to his tally of 12 on wednesday night			1
it was an astonishing moment			0
this great stadium has witnessed plenty of drama over the years and no little pantomime			0
it has n't witnessed much like this , though			0
in the home dugout , manager @entity79 stood aghast			2
this was some way to lose a football match and it was hard not to feel some sympathy for him			0
his team had been pretty lousy but they did n't deserve to lose			0
his thoughts understandably were still with the early penalty shout , somehow denied him when @entity83 hacked down @entity70 in the eleventh minute			1
' that would have set us up nicely , ' he said			0
had @entity31 scored first then it ’s questionable whether @entity3 would have had it in them to respond			1
as it was , nothing much else happened in the first half , apart from what may have been an unpleasant exchange of saliva between @entity82 and @entity72			1
@entity39 , playing as a lone centre forward , missed two chances around the half hour mark , clipping one wide when face to face with @entity46 and then falling over when a slip by @entity62 presented him with another sight of goal			1
there was not a shot on target from either team , however , until @entity87 ’s header required @entity46 to parry in the 44th minute			1
@entity31 were poor enough to allow @entity3 the majority of the possession but @entity131 ’s team , not unusually , did n’t have the wit to do much with it			1
@entity70 ghosted in at the post but could not force the ball beyond @entity3 's goalkeeper @entity238 @entity239 made himself wide in the @entity3 goal to deny @entity31 the opener at @entity4 @entity242 has words with @entity82 after the pair appeared to spit at each other during a heated exchange in the first half @entity72 wipes his eye after he and @entity82 were later shown to have spat at each other during an unsavoury incident @entity82 appears to spit on @entity72 ( left ) before the @entity31 striker returns the favour ( right ) as tempers flared before half time on the right , @entity99 was having a decent game , relatively speaking			1
his night was ended on the hour , though , when @entity131 replaced him with @entity86			0
it seemed an odd move and @entity85 looked less than chuffed			2
at least by then the game was a little more alive			0
@entity70 brought a save from @entity261 after @entity62 headed down a free - kick while at the other end @entity46 saved brilliantly from a @entity87 half - volley and a @entity27 follow - up that perhaps took a little too long to arrive			1
at last there was an atmosphere inside this great stadium and things improved further when @entity64 entered as a substitute			0
his first appearance since recovering from testicular cancer , it was soon marked by a booking but nobody really cared about			0
it was good to see him			0
soon @entity31 could have had a goal			1
a break from another substitute @entity71 found him and @entity72 two - on - one with @entity82 but the pass from one team - mate to another was criminally over hit and , as such , the chance disappeared			1
perhaps that summed up the night for both teams			0
in sport , though , mistakes often decide contests and so it was here			0
@entity46 won a game all on his own for @entity131 with his penalty shoot - out heroics against @entity293 during last summer ’s @entity294			2
here , he did it again in rather different circumstances			0
@entity64 made an emotional return for @entity31 after recovering from testicular cancer @entity64 is given the captain 's armband by @entity62 after coming on in the second half at @entity4 @entity83 battles with @entity70 for the ball in the first half of @entity3 's narrow win over @entity31 @entity87 throws his arm into @entity61 's face in a clash during the first half			1

@entity27 was on hand to fire home with just minutes remaining after @entity46 's poor pass out
@entity3 had looked *toothless* in front of goal until then with @entity46 denying @entity87
@entity31 also came close through @entity70 but he was denied by @entity261
@entity72 was involved in an unsavoury incident with @entity82 as both men spat at each other
