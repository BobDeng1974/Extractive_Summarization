they tried to blockade the building and threw buckets of water from upstairs windows in a bid to prevent the entry of police into the building			2

warning : @entity4 's prime minister @entity5 said the country would not be able continue financing itself for a long time protest : activists from the ' @entity27 ' ( @entity24 ) social movement throw buckets of water to stop police entering a building during a forced eviction in @entity9 , northern @entity4 referring to policy options already available such as the @entity70 's ( @entity70 ) bond - buying programme and long - term funding tenders ( @entity71 ) , mr @entity5 said : ' i will propose measures to stabilise financial markets , using the instruments at our disposal right now			1
' the most urgent issue is the one of financing			0
' we ca n't keep funding ourselves for a long time at the prices we 're currently funding ourselves			0
' @entity84 : @entity4 riot police restrain a member of the ' @entity27 ' ( @entity24 ) social movement , with one officer using his knee to keep his head down with @entity4 and the rest of the @entity96 's ' big four ' , struggling to narrow their differences over how to tackle the bloc 's worsening debt crisis , mr @entity5 said he would fight to secure aid for the country 's banks directly and without enhanced creditor status from @entity58 's rescue funds			1
speaking in parliament ahead of the two - day meeting of @entity58 leaders starting on thursday in @entity59 , mr @entity5 said @entity4 would not be able continue financing itself at current yields for long			1
@entity109 three - year tenders offered by the @entity70 in december and february released more than one trillion euros into the financial system and were credited with staving off the worst effects of the debt crisis late last year and early in 2012			0
but the @entity70 has given no indications that it is planning to offer further @entity115 or revive the dormant bond - buy programme - instead putting the onus on the region 's governments to come up with a concerted response to the crisis			0
mindful of the need to minimise the political stigma associated with a bailout after agreeing to a bank sector rescue worth up to € 100 billion ( £ 80 billion ) , mr @entity5 said he would keep working for a direct recapitalisation of @entity4 's debt - scarred lenders with @entity58 funds			2
that would cut the vicious circle between indebted sovereign borrowers and weak banks			0
crisis : @entity135 is under intense pressure from nervous debt markets to tame one of the highest funding gaps in the @entity96 mr @entity5 said @entity4 would continue to press to remove the preferred creditor status of @entity58 's permanent rescue fund , the @entity145 , thereby avoiding further increases of the country 's debt pile and reassuring other investors they would not drop down the repayments queue			1
' i will keep working to obtain a direct recapitalisation of banks and to make sure the @entity58 aid does n’t override the rights of other holders of public debt , ' mr @entity5 said			2
on that score , he may win support at the summit from @entity159 , the @entity51 's biggest economy and paymaster , which appears ready to budge on using the rescue funds more flexibly to help banks and reassure investors spooked by the increased risk of facing writedowns on government bonds			2
@entity4 ’s banks were crippled by a 2008 property crash			0
the @entity4 government is under intense pressure from nervous debt markets to tame one of the highest funding gaps in the @entity96 and , to garner support within the bloc for its policy preferences , will be keen to show new austerity measures to @entity58 leaders at the summit			1
summit : ( from left to right ) @entity159 chancellor @entity179 , @entity4 prime minister @entity5 @entity180 president @entity182 and president of the @entity185 @entity184 , at a meeting in @entity187 on june 22 @entity135 said yesterday it was considering raising consumer , energy and property taxes to control a public deficit that may have already exceeded one of its budgeted ceilings for the full year			1
' the most urgent issue is the one of financing			0
we ca n’t keep funding ourselves for a long time at the prices we ’re currently ( paying ) , ' mr @entity5 said today			2
@entity135 ’s short - term borrowing costs nearly tripled from a month ago at an auction yesterday , while demand shrank as investors continue to seek ever higher premiums to hold @entity4 debt			0
it was revealed today that @entity4 ’s 10 - year debt yields are flat at 6.84 per cent , still uncomfortably close to the seven per cent level that triggered full - scale bailouts for @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212 .			0
