if @entity1 leaves the @entity2 at the end of this season — and it is by no means certain — then he will leave behind barely a trace			1
inside @entity7 , the @entity6 has always provided a welcome contrast to the emotional stresses of life epitomised by his predecessor @entity11 but — on the field and across the landscape of @entity16 football — @entity1 has made the shallowest of footprints			1
progress at the @entity20 has in recent years been slight			2
indeed , you could say there has been none , particularly in relation to money spent			0
at @entity7 , however , the fact is that the identity of the manager represents only a small part of the problem			1
@entity1 could be out of a job in the summer , and if he is , he will have left little behind @entity7 captain @entity33 has fallen well short of the standards he set in recent seasons @entity1 leaves the stadium as @entity7 suffered their fifth defeat in seven matches as reported in @entity40 after @entity7 ’s defeat in @entity42 last month , there is no particular desire at the club to sack @entity1			1
more poor results , more points separating his team from champions - elect @entity48 may cause the ground to shift a little further but any decision regarding the manager will be motivated much more by what happens next rather than what happened over the past eight months			0
certainly , this has been a lamentable defence of the title , as bad as when conceding it by 11 points in 2013			0
at the @entity20 there is , however , a recognition that problems are not all down to the manager			0
there are some issues with @entity1			1
some @entity7 players think he is too nice — a soft touch who does not inspire with words or his substitutions and who displays a fondness for a 4 - 4 - 2 formation that they feel leaves them vulnerable			1
@entity1 has not alienated or even polarised his dressing room , however			2
the majority are happy to work and play for him			0
the more significant problem is that @entity7 ’s squad , constructed carefully and expensively , is too old , too foreign and has not been improved by recent transfers			1
@entity82 is one of very few englishmen in a first team squad that is too foreign and too old @entity7 signed defender @entity85 for £ 32million last summer and he has been poor @entity86 was signed in january from @entity87 for £ 28m but has only scored once since arriving @entity7 have had a very good team for quite a while now			1
signing @entity89 and @entity90 in 2010 and @entity91 a year later lifted them to their current level but nothing since the first @entity2 title has hinted at the further progress many presumed would be inevitable			1
recruitment has , on the whole , been poor , thus allowing established players to coast , perhaps subconsciously , without the pressure of in - house competition			0
football director @entity102 has been largely responsible for this and his contribution , at least that which we can see , has been disappointing given the reputation earned at @entity42			0
at all clubs , teams and players must move forward to thrive but too many at @entity7 have stagnated			2
@entity33 , for example , no longer seems capable of looking after his own performances , never mind that of his team			1
for a club captain , his popularity in the @entity7 dressing room is limited			2
elsewhere , players such as @entity118 contributed when @entity7 were playing well but disappeared once things became harder			2
since hacking at @entity122 during the @entity42 defeat , an act that earned him the cheapest of yellow cards , the @entity120 international has played only 13 minutes of two games			0
it is understood that the two things are not unrelated			0
@entity118 is just one who may fret a little about his future this summer			0
@entity102 ( left ) has failed to live up to his reputation , and @entity7 's recruitment has been poor @entity133 , a £ 22m signing from @entity134 , could find himself shipped out as @entity7 try to deal with @entity135 @entity118 gives a thumbs up despite @entity7 's defeat at @entity138 , and the @entity120 's poor form wary of @entity135 restrictions , @entity7 can not spend enormous sums on targets such as @entity144 midfielder @entity143 without first selling			1
others who are vulnerable include @entity133 , @entity147 and even @entity90			0
the @entity90 debate is not new but what should be kept in mind is that the @entity151 will not be going anywhere until someone matches a salary that exceeds £ 1million a month			0
it could be that @entity7 ’s climb back to the very top will be slow			1
they will need to be shrewder in the market and hope investment in their academy pays off			0
better decisions are required from top to bottom			0
as for @entity1 , he would be daft to think he is not vulnerable and a late - season surge would help him			2
odd as it sounds , however , the identity of the manager is currently not @entity7 ’s biggest issue .			1

@entity7 have made little progress since @entity1 arrived
despite last year 's title win , @entity7 have again failed miserably to retain it
@entity33 no longer capable of producing top performances
@entity7 ’s squad , constructed carefully and expensively , is too old , too foreign
