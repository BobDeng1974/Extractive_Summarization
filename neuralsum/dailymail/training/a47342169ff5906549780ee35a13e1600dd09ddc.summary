while the @entity1 has always been a beacon of medical advancement for the world , @entity1 women today are expected to live shorter lives than their mothers			1
two recent studies found that life expectancy for women have decreased the last two decades			1
since these women are more likely to be unemployed or working low - wage jobs , researchers believe the new health care law may combat this backwards slide , but point out that it might not solve the underlying problem			2
' health care is far from the whole story , ' @entity17 , co-author of one of the studies , told the @entity22			0
' more and more people are beginning to realize that the non-health - care factors are at least as important			0
' backwards : life expectancy rates among women have been worsening in about half of all @entity1 counties			1
above , red signifies the counties where the life expectancy rate for women is declining @entity17 was the co-author of a @entity35 study published in march which reported that for the last two decades , the mortality rate for women had increased in half of @entity1 counties , while the male mortality rate only increased in 3 per cent			1
@entity17 said he was so shocked by it 's outcome , that he and his research partner went back and did the numbers again just to double check			0
get the diploma : white , female high - school dropouts are expected to die five years before the previous generation but their initial calculations were right and soon confirmed by a study by the @entity49 which found that female life expectancy either stagnated or declined in 45 per cent of @entity1 counties between 1985 and 2010			1
the studies agreed that women were living shorter lives , but researchers still do n't know what to blame			2
' clearly something is going on , ' @entity17 told the @entity22			0
' it could be cultural , political , or environmental , but the truth is we do n't really know the answer			0
' there is a noticeable connection between where women live and how long they live			0
@entity17 discovered this by coloring each county on a map according to whether female life expectancy had substantial improvement , minimal improvement or was worsening ( colored red )			2
the most troubled area for women seems to be in the @entity76 , where there is the highest density of red - especially in the states of @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			1
the red travels up to the @entity85 states of @entity86 and @entity87 before tapering out in the @entity88			0
the @entity89 and @entity90 are the areas with the least amount of red			2
other researchers have pointed out the role that education plays in female mortality rates			0
according to a @entity101 study published in august 2012 , life expectancy among white high - school dropouts has taken a dive in the last 18 years and now these women are expected to die five years earlier than the previous generation			1
the only similar event in human life expectancy happened right after the fall of the @entity108 among @entity110 men , which has since been attributed to alcohol consumption and a spike in accidental death rates			2
poor , uneducated women may well be facing similar hardships after the recession as @entity119 men			0
only one third of female high - school dropouts are employed , and working low income jobs or being unemployed all together can cause stress which manifests itself in smoking or obesity			1
' life is different for women without a high - school degree than it was a few decades ago , and in most cases it 's a lot worse , ' said demographer @entity131			1
' it 's really just a perfect storm			0

two studies found that life expectancy rates among women have been *steadily* falling in about half of @entity1 counties
according to a map by the @entity35 , the states most *affected* are @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83
the @entity90 and @entity89 are the areas least *impacted* by the trend
the mortality rate is falling among white , high - school dropouts especially who are expected to die five years earlier than the previous generation
