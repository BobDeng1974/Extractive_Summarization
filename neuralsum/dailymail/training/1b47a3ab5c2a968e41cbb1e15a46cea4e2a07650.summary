by @entity0 @entity2 new boy @entity1 is gearing up for a month - long battle with @entity4 for a place in @entity8 's @entity7 team			1
the 27 - year - old @entity9 left @entity10 for the @entity11 last month in the search for regular first - team football			1
however , in order to achieve that this season , he will have to oust @entity17 , the @entity2 ' @entity18 for last season , and that is a battle be believes will be fought out during the remainder of pre-season			1
there 's a long period until we start the @entity7			0
' it 's normal for everyone to work hard , train hard and after that , we 'll see what happens			0
i think everyone wants to be in the first xi. we 'll see			0
' @entity4 is a good guy and a good keeper			2
but whatever happens , it 's important that it helps the team			2
' it 's not just competition for us , it 's everyone in the team			0
at this moment , no - one is in the starting @entity42 ' ends disappointment : the @entity9 was given a run in the side by @entity58 last season but could not keep his place penalty : @entity4 was the shoot - out hero as @entity2 knocked @entity63 out of the @entity64 last season			1

former @entity10 *goalkeeper* has moved to @entity67 this *summer*
@entity1 had spells in @entity10 's first team but *ultimately* lost out to @entity28
@entity2 *manager* @entity8 will *choose* between @entity4 and the @entity9
