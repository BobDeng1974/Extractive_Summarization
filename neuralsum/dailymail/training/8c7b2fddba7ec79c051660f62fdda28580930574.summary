by @entity0 there are fresh calls to raise @entity4 â€™s drinking age from 18 to 21 , with the rate of alcohol - fuelled violence increasing among young @entity4			1
the @entity8 report claims that young people who engage in binge drinking during early adult years are putting themselves at a greater risk of alcohol - induced brain impairment			1
authored by four academics from leading @entity4 universities , the report cites new evidence that increasing the legal purchasing age of alcohol will reduce instances of youth alcohol - related harm			0
cause for concern : the medical journal of australia have released a new report calling for the legal drinking age to be raised to 21 citing an increase in alcohol - attributed hospitalisations and the normalisation of binge drinking among @entity4 youth , the group are calling for the prioritisation of prevention			1
analysing evidence gathered between 1970 and 1975 , when the legal drinking age was dropped to 18 in @entity37 and several @entity4 states , the report claims that car crashes involving 18 to 20 - year - old drivers increased by 10 per cent			1
in some cases , the trickle - down effect also meant higher instances of alcohol - related car crashes among 15 to 17 year olds			2
evidence relating to the trickle - down effect shows that people aged a few years below the legal drinking age can easily obtain alcohol from older siblings or friends			2
angling for action : the increase in alcohol - attributed hospitalisations are a key concern for the four @entity4 researchers calling for the legal drinking age increase meanwhile , the positive impact of a drinking age hike can be seen in data that came out of the @entity62 when the drinking age was raised across all states			1
in 1984 , the @entity62 government passed legislation to raise the drinking age federally by withholding highway funding to states that would not raise the drinking age to 21			2
once the drinking age was raised , evidence from 17 states found an average reduction of underage crash involvement of 16 per cent			0
260 youths aged 17 - 19 surveyed similarly , the flow - on effect of the rise meant less people were drinking in adolescence and consequently , developed less harmful drinking patterns as adults			0
the report cites a 2010 @entity82 experience questionnaire of youth aged 17 to 19 as evidence of the normalisation of binge drinking culture			1
acknowledging that their hard - line approach may not go down too well with politicians and alcohol companies in @entity4 , the researchers also propose alternative policy options			0
less challenging options include increasing the drinking age to 19 or 20 years old , so as to remove the legal purchasing of alcohol from high school students			0
another option proposed is limiting the types and amount of alcohol that can be purchased by young people , as in @entity103 or @entity104 .			0
