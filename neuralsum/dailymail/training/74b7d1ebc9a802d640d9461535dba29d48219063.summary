he hit out during the case of a mother and father who want to void their adoption of two girls from @entity7 in 2008 via major @entity4 adoption agencies @entity76 and @entity77			2
they claim they were victims of a ‘ bait and switch ’ scheme because the children later developed severe mental health problems which they were never told about which got so bad the youngsters threatened to kill them			1

they were not identified in court and were referred to as ‘ @entity93 ’ and ‘ @entity94 ’ whilst the parents were known as ‘ pf ’ and @entity97 ’			2
today judge @entity8 made public a letter sent last month by the consulate general of the @entity7 in @entity12 in which he demanded ‘ detailed information on the case ’			1
the letter , signed by consul general @entity105 , said that he had been contacted by the @entity7 embassy to the @entity4 in @entity107 and that they wanted updates too			2
in his reply letter , which he also made public , judge @entity8 refused to hand over any documents and asked that they come to court like everyone else - a representative of the @entity7 was said to be at the latest hearing although they did not identify themselves			1
team : @entity118 , the lawyer for the siblings , is among the legal representatives in court today in @entity26 venue : @entity26 's surrgate court sat at the county court house in @entity125 , @entity34 , @entity12 today chill to relations : @entity41 and @entity127 appeared to be on better terms when they met in @entity130 this week at a summit for @entity133 leaders but the judge 's comments suggest tensions between the @entity2 and the @entity4 he also told mr @entity105 that he is ‘ fully familiar ’ with international law and points out that he has ‘ served in various capacities in @entity4 embassies in @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 ’			1
furthermore , he adds , he ‘ attended the @entity145 and the @entity146 at @entity147			0

@entity153 first disclosed that @entity41 's children 's commissioner had weighed into the row over the children on 30 october			0
@entity39 called for immediate access to the children and said he had asked @entity7 's diplomats to intervene			2
' they remain two underage citizens of @entity7 , ' he said			2
' they are protected by our laws			0
the @entity7 consul has a right to meet them , to access them			2
this is what must be done right now - to get access to these children			0
' this is what the @entity7 consulate in @entity12 must be occupied with now - to meet and chat with them			1
' there is little chance to bring them back to @entity7			2
the @entity4 will not give them away			0
the children can go back only when they reach the right age and make such a decision			0
' @entity39 also accused the parents of ' covering their inconsistency by blaming the poor children , who have already been placed in a psychiatric clinic			2
he claimed the children have been labelled and are imprisoned in mental institutions			0
' this is deceit , ' he said			0
' they want not merely to surrender the children , they are seeking to cancel adoption , alleging the children 's diagnoses were somehow concealed from them , ' said @entity198			0
' this is utter nonsense , ' he said			0
' the @entity4 couple had a complete dossier on each child and had the right to consult any doctor			0
they could have sought additional medical opinions if they had wished			0
' in a long statement to the court the judge then explained the extent of @entity7 ’s tampering in the case			1
he said : ‘ this court has learned that there have been contacts by a representative of the @entity7 with the petitioners in regard to this matter			2
these contacts have left these adoptive parents in a state of fright			0
‘ conduct by the @entity7 has affected this litigation ...			0
inadvertent or intentional @entity7 conduct will not intimidate this court , judge or litigants to bar public knowledge to the sensitive issues presented in this matter			1
‘ under @entity236 any contact between the @entity7 diplomatic corps and local political institutions is inappropriate			0
any such contacts should be through the @entity238			0
the @entity7 cites @entity236 in their letter to this court and i urge them to follow it ’			2
the parents were not in court but were represented by their attorney @entity244 who said that @entity7 was trying to be an ‘ interloper ’			1
he described the case as an ' entirely tragic situation ' and said the mother and father they were going through ' indescribable pain '			0
mr @entity244 said that the @entity7 adoption agencies , who he called ' agents of the @entity7 ' , were able to identify his clients and get their unlisted telephone number to their total shock			1
he said that as a result their privacy had been ' violated ' and that they were ' subject to intimidation and fear by the breach of confidentiality '			0
referring to his description of his clients as by the @entity7 as of as ' despicable ' , mr @entity244 said : ‘ i would request that the @entity7 minister of state for children be more temperate in his comments '			2
the case has provoked a debate in the @entity4 and strong criticism of the parents by some , but mr @entity244 said this was ' scurrilous ' and ' disrespectful ' with no basis in reality			0
judge @entity8 also praised the parents and said there was ‘ not an iota of proof ’ that they had victimized the girls			0
he passed his law banning internet adoptions in @entity26 because he said he believes the process is so unregulated it amounts to ‘ human trafficking ’			1
his ruling bans any adoptions organised through the @entity288 or via any ‘ unofficial adoption programme ’ that is not affiliated to the state			0
those who disobey it could be fined or thrown in jail for contempt			0
judge @entity8 said : ‘ today marks a court attempt to regulate the rehoming / unofficial adoptive trade in adoptive children			2
correspondence : the official letter from the @entity7 consul - general in @entity12			1
but the country 's agents also contacted the parents in the case on their unlisted telephone number robust reply : the judge 's response to the consul - general			1
he warned @entity7 authorities today that he would not be intimidated @entity314 order : judge @entity8 has forbidden any adoptions via the internet going ahead in @entity26 in this order , published today ‘ this is a first step			1
i urge other state adoption courts as well as state legislators and federal legislators to take suitable actions to regulate this aspect of the adoption process			0
’ judge @entity8 adjourned the case until december when he will decide if he will continue to hear it in open court			0
most adoption cases are held in private			0
he said he feels that the ‘ integrity of the @entity4 adoption agencies ... has been called into question ’ and the allegations of fraud claimed by the parents were so ‘ disturbing ’ they should be heard in public			0
mr @entity244 , @entity118 , the lawyer for the children , the adoption agencies and @entity26 social services all want it held behind closed doors			1
mr @entity118 told the court that earlier in the day he had visited the girls at their facility and that he was ‘ satisfied ’ they were being looked after properly			0
last year @entity7 president @entity41 banned @entity4 from adopting @entity7 children in what was seen as a return of @entity348 style diplomatic tit for tat			1
before that , in the past 30 years some 60,000 children had been adopted by @entity4 from @entity7 as part of an industry worth $ 330 million .			2
