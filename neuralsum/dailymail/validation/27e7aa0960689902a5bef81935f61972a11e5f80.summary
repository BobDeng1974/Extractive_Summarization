@entity1 's biggest pensions firm has come under fire for exploiting savers after dishing out £ 49million in pay and perks to its bosses last year			1
with less than a week before the biggest shake - up in the pensions market for more than a century , insurance giant @entity8 was last night accused of ‘ greed ’ after revealing the extraordinary awards lavished on its senior executives			2
mps and pension experts said the scale of the awards would be particularly galling for millions of savers trapped in poor - value annuities or paying excessive charges			1
@entity23 ( left ) , the @entity8 ’s @entity22 chief executive , was the highest paid board member , but this was dwarfed by the £ 15.4million scooped by fund manager @entity25 ( right ) @entity23 , the @entity8 ’s @entity22 chief executive , was the highest paid board member , with a total package of £ 11.8million last year – a 36 per cent pay rise from the £ 8.7million he received the previous year			1
this takes the total amount he has collected in five years at the helm to more than £ 41million			0
the 52 - year - old announced his resignation earlier this month and will shortly become chief executive of @entity35			1
but his pay was dwarfed by the £ 15.4million scooped by fund manager @entity25 – who runs almost £ 35billion of savers ’ money for the @entity8 ’s investment arm @entity40			1
mr @entity25 runs several funds which are widely held in savers ’ pensions and investment isas			2
these include the @entity47 fund , which runs just under £ 24billion of savers ’ money			2
@entity8 ’s nine board directors shared a total of £ 49million in pay and perks last year			1
@entity53 , the boss of the insurer ’s @entity55 arm and the man expected to take over from mr @entity23 , was paid £ 11.4million			2
last night dr @entity58 , a leading pensions expert and a government adviser for older workers , accused @entity8 of ‘ short - changing ’ savers who took out annuities by offering poor rates			1
@entity23 , the @entity8 ’s @entity22 chief executive , was the highest paid board member , with a total package of £ 11.8million last year she said : ‘ over the last few years @entity8 has been one of the worst culprits , offering poor annuity rates			1
' i would imagine that any saver short - changed in one of its annuities would feel most uncomfortable to know the extra profit this company has made on their retirement fund has helped bump up the pay for its top bosses to a figure they could only dream of earning in a lifetime			1
’ today a 65 - year - old man with a £ 100,000 pensions pot would receive an annual income of just £ 3,899 from a @entity8 annuity			2
this is more than £ 400 less per year than they would get if they shopped around for the best deal			0
earlier this year an investigation by the @entity90 watchdog found the £ 12billion - a - year annuity market is not working well for customers , with millions of people trapped in poor deals			2
@entity95 , a @entity96 member of the treasury select committee , said : ‘ savers and particularly pensioners will be incredibly angry at this greed which comes at their expense			0
the failure in annuities demonstrates why such obscene pay is out of order			0
’ the payouts are bigger than those handed out to @entity1 ’s biggest banks , which have been the primary focus of anger over fat - cat pay			0
@entity114 ’ chief executive @entity113 was comfortably the highest - paid bank boss in the @entity1 last year , scooping £ 11.5million			1
@entity115 of @entity116 was next in the pecking order with £ 7.6million			0
in comparison , highly paid pensions bosses have largely managed to avoid the limelight			0
but the increasingly fierce criticism of the pensions industry – including accusations of excessive charges and poor annuity rates for savers – has contributed to growing criticism over pay			0
last night @entity8 defended the huge payouts			0
it said profits at the company jumped 14 per cent last year to £ 3.2billion , while it paid out £ 945million in dividends to shareholders , a 10 per cent jump on the previous year			0
a spokesman said : ‘ the remuneration of our leadership team is closely linked to the strong long - term performance of the business			0

@entity8 dished out £ 49million in pay and perks to its bosses last year
@entity23 , the @entity8 ’s @entity22 chief executive , received £ 11.8million
but fund manager @entity25 scooped a *massive* £ 15.4million
claimed figures will be galling for savers trapped in poor - value annuities
