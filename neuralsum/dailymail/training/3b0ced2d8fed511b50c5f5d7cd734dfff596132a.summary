no worries : @entity4 looked confident as he weighed in well within the 12st limit at @entity62 inside : @entity0 weighed in just within the limit to ensure the rematch goes ahead on saturday night the @entity53 said to @entity66 as they posed for the eyeball - to - eyeball photographs : ' you look drawn and dehydrated			1

very nervous , if you ask me			0
' @entity4 responded by saying : ' i did the weight comfortably , we wanted to moan about the 4pm weigh - in for the sake of moaning			0

i could n't be more ready			0
' @entity0 needs reassurance but he ca n't find it and for that reason he 's going to struggle			0
