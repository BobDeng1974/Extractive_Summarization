@entity0 never has a problem filling her front row			0
her shows are easily some of the most hotly anticipated over the fashion week period			2
in fact her shows have become so exclusive and well respected that the 42 - year - old @entity7 designer has taken to presenting her collections at @entity9 rather than in her home town of @entity11			1
and yet despite her relocation fans of the brand are still prepared to travel far and wide in order to catch a glimpse of her sought - after @entity17 creations with today 's front row including @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and of course , the illusive @entity25 @entity24 editor @entity23			1
models wore lose - fitting dresses in elegant silks			0
the theme for the collection was clearly oversized as billowing shirts and parachute trousers proved that bigger is better			0
other , more feminine pieces included sheer slips printed with intricate patterns and decorated with structured embroidery giving the dresses body and shape			0
fans of the brand can rejoice as the 42 - year - old designer presented her usual relaxed designs oversized outlines and muted tones were on the menu at the show in @entity56 this morning @entity0 embraced the much appreciated @entity58 trend of flat shoes on her catwalk today the designer has n't completely forgotten her @entity7 style routes as she gave a nod to the bare nipple trend that consumed the catwalks of @entity66			1
naked breasts appeared across the catwalks of @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 during the @entity11 shows and they were seen again today peeping from under the delicate slips and tartan silk dresses			0
as well as following the trend for exposed chests , @entity0 embraced the ( much appreciated ) fashion for flat shoes with models taking to the runway in various leather sandals , fastened with leather thongs snaking up their ankles			0
as well as flat shoes , @entity0 also seemed to give a nod towards the bare breast trend that was seen across the catwalks of @entity66 @entity27 seemed on her best behaviour today ( right ) following last season where she caused quite a stir ( left ) when she led models astray by skipping down the catwalk although the collection seemed to be consistent with her previous collections with her @entity94 line featuring the similar shapes to today 's offerings , there was one element to the show that differed greatly from last season and that was @entity27			1
last season saw the 22 - year - old model causing a stir during @entity0 's catwalk when she skipped down the runway leading other 's astray as she closed the show , however today she appeared to be on her very best behaviour			1
@entity27 appeared on the catwalk looking more serious and sophisticated than ever in palette of black and dark grey as she wore an oversized embellished coat and lace shorts			0
her sleeked back hair and solemn expression provided a complete turn - around from the previous season that saw the usually goofy @entity27 taking centre stage			2
it appears that the 22 - year - old is growing up in the world of fashion and what better place to do it than on the runway of one of the world 's most sophisticated designers			2
the illusive @entity25 @entity125 , @entity23 refused to miss this morning 's catwalk @entity21 was spotted on today 's front row and backstage with @entity0 ( left ) and fashionable friends @entity19 and @entity20 ( right ) were also keen to see what @entity0 had on offer this season the 42 - year - old designer takes a bow after presenting her @entity17 collection this morning in @entity56			1

the @entity0 show is one of the most hotly anticipated over the @entity137
today 's show in @entity56 *attracted* a star - *studded* crowd including @entity21 and @entity23
the 42 - year - old designer presented a collection that was *sympathetic* to her previous designs
@entity27 *regularly* walks for @entity0 however this season she was far more refined
during the @entity94 catwalk @entity27 led other models astray when she skipped down the catwalk
