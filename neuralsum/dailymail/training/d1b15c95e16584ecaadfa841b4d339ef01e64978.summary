elementary , my dear @entity0			1
so the demanding task of winning the @entity4 @entity3 was made to look by the supreme racing craft of the @entity6 chasing his second , life - defining , world title			1
with victory secured in the suffocating heat of the @entity12 track , @entity0 beamed on the podium as he was interviewed , bizarrely enough , by @entity14 , aka actor @entity15			1
but what looked like a piffling one - pipe triumph for a driver of @entity0 ’s brilliance was a massive statement of intent in what , at this early stage of the season at least , is a private championship duel between the two @entity27 ’ men , @entity0 and @entity28			1
my race : @entity0 celebrates after securing victory at the @entity4 @entity3 jump for joy : it was the @entity34 's first points finish of the season after retiring in @entity36 two weeks ago much deserved : @entity37 congratulates @entity0 after he secures first place in @entity4 celebrity guest : sherlock star @entity15 was a surprise interviewer for the drivers after the race ‘ @entity46 to @entity0 , ’ was the verdict of @entity44 , the grid ’s most experienced competitor			1
yes , the @entity47 - @entity28 tally stands at a single race win each , but @entity28 ’s triumph in @entity51 a fortnight ago was achieved after his garage - mate suffered early engine failure			1
the statistic of relevance was the 17.3sec gap between @entity0 and @entity28 in second place			1
that is light years when two men , unimpeded by incident and without any apparent technical faults , are driving identical cars			0
@entity0 , who was on pole , started impressively by moving to block @entity28 , who started from directly behind him in third			1
his advantage established , he merely purred into an ever - increasing lead			2
still , there was the heat , the fuel , the tyres to contend with			0
we heard how this season would serve - up ‘ the hare and the tortoise ’ races			1
would @entity0 ’s hare be caught ? no chance			1
the absence of a safety - car period and no more than the merest sprinkling of fleeting rain added a sense of inevitability as the 56 laps ticked by			2
all too easy : @entity0 comfortably won in @entity4 as @entity27 dominated the race @entity87 : @entity0 and team - mate @entity28 embrace after shutting out the top two places you ca n't catch me : @entity0 started well from pole to avoid any collisions with the chasing pack podium : @entity27 team - mate @entity28 fought off @entity96 's @entity37 to take second place @entity0 shares the @entity99 record for number of pole positions with @entity102 — he has 33 — but he does n’t usually convert them like on sunday			1
he has won just 13 times from pole , including only six victories from his last 21			2
race @entity4 2014 @entity107 : retired @entity99 2013 @entity108 : 3rdbrazilian 2012 finished : @entity109 2012 finished : @entity110 : @entity111 : @entity112 : @entity113 : @entity114 : @entity115 : @entity116 : @entity117 : @entity118 2007 finished : 1st so @entity0 , 17 seconds ? ‘ it ’s massive , ’ he said			1
‘ i ca n’t remember the last time i had a gap like that , particularly with a team - mate driving the same car			2
that ’s definitely a good feeling			0
‘ i learned a few things in practice but it ’s a different thing learning it from applying it , but today i applied it and that ’s why i blew him away			0
’ @entity0 ’s win was the 23rd of his career , passing @entity138 ’s 22			1
that accolade went with his 33rd pole on saturday , which made him the joint @entity99 record holder alongside no less a legend than @entity102			0
his perfect weekend was completed by his setting the fastest lap. it is a delight to watch @entity0 at the wheel in this commanding form			2
he is simply the fastest man on the planet			0
as the paddock was being dismantled — next stop @entity151 on sunday — he summed up his approach to racing			0
he said : ‘ my trainer was saying in the last few years , “ if people could see that you ’re always in bed early			0
nobody sees that , and they say you ’re less focused			0
and they say @entity37 ( @entity37 ) is more focused just because he ’s getting results			2
” ‘ i ’m giving it everything			0
i ’m only thinking about the championship			0
i ’m thinking about winning			0
i ’m living and breathing it , as i do every year			0
‘ in my driving style , i ’m more mature			0
i ’m starting to see the benefits of the mistakes , and the things i ’ve said , or the things i ’ve done , and i even noticed it today			0
i am more calculating in the race			0
’ @entity28 still leads the championship table			2
in fact , he can follow @entity174 home in the next two races and still lead the table			0
no wonder @entity28 seemed reasonably unperturbed afterwards			2
his confidence , apparently at an all - time high prior to the race , is far from being shot			0
it is the contention here that the best seasons are shaped by a straight rivalry between team - mates			0
think @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity174			0
are we in for a repeat treat ? @entity44 ’s thoughts are instructive			2
even he , the most balanced of drivers , had the odd moment of friction with @entity194 ’s side of the garage in his championship year of 2009			0
history : it was @entity0 's 100th points finish in his @entity201 career tight : @entity202 had to be on guard in his @entity204 to hold off @entity206 's @entity205 comfortable : @entity0 crosses the chequered flag down to you : @entity28 and @entity0 celebrate with @entity27 team engineer @entity209 ‘ it matters who the individuals are , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity28 and @entity0 are close as friends but one has won a world championship and the other has n’t , so that might change things a bit between them			1
looking at what @entity0 did today is going to hurt ( @entity28 ) a little bit			1
’ in other news , @entity37 ’s third place was a tribute to @entity96 ’s infinite resource and sagacity			1
it was impossible , though , not to feel some sympathy for @entity37 ’s team - mate @entity228			1
after being disqualified for an alleged fuel - pressure irregularity in @entity36 , he suffered a broken front wing after being released unsafely from the pit box			2
that cost him a 10sec stop - go penalty			2
he retired from the race and will still get a 10 - place grid penalty under the new harsh regulations			1
@entity202 was fourth , showing that @entity204 could yet enter the fray as serious title contenders when the @entity241 season starts in may			1
as for @entity0 , the victor in the first @entity27 one - two since 1955 , he said : ‘ i ’ve already made notes now and will go away the next couple of days			1
there ’s more to come			0
mistake : @entity228 was forced to retire after an early release from the pit - stop , followed by wing damage down and out : @entity248 encountered problems on the first corner , picking up a puncture			1

@entity0 wins the @entity4 @entity3 from pole position
@entity28 finishes second as @entity27 secure top two finish
world champion @entity37 grabs first podium finish this season
@entity202 in fourth , @entity259 's @entity44 sixth
@entity228 to face ten - place grid penalty for unsafe pit release
