the mother condemned to death in @entity2 for marrying a @entity3 is being prevented from fleeing the country by her callous brother - and could face an entirely new trial			1
@entity7 has been hit with a new petition by @entity9 who has publicly vowed to execute her if he gets the chance			1
but lawyers for @entity7 , a 27 - year - old doctor , say that he is just acting out of spite and that he does not have any authority over her			1
@entity14 can also reveal that @entity7 could face an entirely new hearing that could delay her departure by weeks or months			1
she is now facing a possible new hurdle to her freedom she faces forgery charges that relate to the documents she used to try and flee @entity2 - and could be hauled before a judge again			1
the twist represents the latest setback for @entity7 in her attempt to leave @entity2 and fly to the @entity33			1
she was freed on june 30 after spending eight months behind bars in a horrific women 's prison in the @entity37 capital @entity38			0
during her time in the facility she gave birth to @entity24 , one month , in shackles whilst her son @entity22 , 21 months , was by her side during the entire ordeal			0
the day after the sentence was overturned @entity7 and her family tried to fly to @entity2 en route to the @entity33 but she was detained and accused of using false papers in a naked attempt to thrawt her by the @entity37 government			1
now adding to her woes is her half brother @entity9 , a strict muslim who was supposedly furious when he learned she had been let out of jail and vowed vengeance to restore @entity53 honour			0
@entity7 's lawyer @entity58 told @entity14 : ‘ her brother [ @entity59 ] has launched a new petition to the family court to prove that @entity7 is his sister			1
‘ he does not want @entity7 to travel to @entity2			1
' barbaric ' : as well as the death sentence for apostasy ( the crime of abandoning your religion ) @entity68 was also sentenced to 100 lashes for what the court deemed her adultery for marrying a @entity3 ‘ he asked the court to rule that @entity7 is his sister			1
this would give him a legal right over her			0
‘ but he does not have the authority to demand this right – it is only a father or a mother that can demand this legal status			0
' he is doing this to prevent @entity7 from travelling outside of @entity2			1
‘ @entity84 has not been officially informed of this latest move			0
she has not been interviewed and has not appeared in court			0
‘ we [ @entity7 ’s legal team ] are aware of the new legal process but we have not received any documents as yet			1
' @entity7 is married to @entity91 , a naturalized @entity33 citizen , and was sentenced to death and 100 lashes for apostasy and adultery when she married him because the court did not recognize the wedding			1
a judge ruled that because she was born a @entity53 - her father left home when she was six - it did not matter that she was raised a @entity3 and said that she had the renounce her faith or die			0
fight for life : mr @entity91 , an @entity33 citizen , has been fighting for his wife and children 's release but his lawyers believe the help he has received from the @entity33 embassy has been ' shameful ' @entity7 's family history is complicated and it appears @entity9 was part of the second family that her father started after he left her mother			2
she claims never to have met him in her life and his motives for interfering in her life seem somewhat murky			0
@entity58 told @entity14 that @entity7 still has to deal with the forgery allegations before she is free to leave @entity2 and move in with @entity20 , a biochemist who lives in @entity118 , @entity119			2
a hearing is set for thursdsay but what happens after that is unclear			0
he said : ‘ @entity7 wants to leave @entity2 as soon as possible			2
‘ but she is still being investigated by the @entity124 with relation to the allegation that she had obtained a false travel document			2
this is still on - going			0
‘ @entity7 has not been given an @entity33 passport			2
' @entity129 , of religious campaign group @entity130 , said that she did not know what the court would do about the forgery allegations			0
road to freedom : @entity7 holds her baby girl close as she is driven away from the police station in @entity38 on thursday night she said that it was possible @entity7 could have to go through a new trial , but negotiations are said to be ongoing between the @entity37 government and the @entity33 embassy in @entity38 over her release			1
@entity7 's case attracted international attention and the governments of the @entity146 , the @entity33 and the @entity147 all called for her to be freed			2
@entity148 and @entity149 were also among those demanding she be released , as was human rights campaigner @entity151			0

@entity58 told @entity14 that despite all the strain @entity7 and her family are under they are ' all fine '			0
he said : ' @entity7 , @entity20 and the children are in good health			0
