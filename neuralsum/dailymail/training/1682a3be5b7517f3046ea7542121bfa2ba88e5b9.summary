jailed : former @entity8 actor @entity6 , left , was cleared of murdering a nightclub doorman but was jailed for perverting the course of justice			1
he is pictured right as his @entity8 character @entity7 @entity6 , who was on bail for supplying cocaine when the murder took place , was jailed on january 25 for a total of four years and 10 months			1
the facts can now be revealed after mrs justice @entity29 lifted reporting restrictions put in place to avoid prejudicing the trial of another defendant , @entity33 , who was today convicted of the murder			0
@entity13 , known by the nicknames @entity36 and @entity37 , was gunned down in a ' ruthlessly planned and callously carried out execution '			2
prosecutors said it was the result of an argument between criminals			0
those involved in the shooting went to extraordinary lengths to lure mr @entity13 , 44 , to his death on february 24 last year			1
he had gone to the @entity47 public house that night following a series of phone calls he received from a pay - as - you - go mobile phone			2
victim : nightclub doorman @entity13 was shot in the face ' this was a dirty phone obtained for the purpose of luring mr @entity13 to his death and used in a disciplined way that was designed to leave no clue as to the identity of its user , ' prosecutor @entity61 had told the jury			1
@entity6 's unwitting involvement began when he delivered a Â£ 30 bag of cocaine to drug user @entity66			2
the former soap star told the trial he would supply @entity66 , a convicted armed robber , with drugs ' about three or four times a day '			0
that night , ' ( @entity66 ) asked for a lift to go and get money so he could pay for the drugs ' , @entity6 said			1
the pair then drove to @entity75 , around the corner from the pub , and @entity66 left the vehicle as @entity6 snorted a line of cocaine			2
mr @entity13 arrived at the @entity47 in the company of two other men shortly after 6.30pm on the night of his murder			1
they spent about 10 minutes in the pub before they went outside and stood on the pavement			0
a short while later the gunman approached and said to mr @entity13 , ' are you @entity37 ? '			2
mr @entity13 nodded and the killer raised his shotgun and fired it directly into the victim 's face from a distance of three or four feet			2
mr @entity13 fell to the ground in a cloud of smoke and died instantly as @entity66 ran back to the waiting car			2
detective chief inspector @entity97 of @entity99 's major incident team said it was a ' shocking ' crime			0
he added : ' any murder is an appalling event but to me this was striking - it was 6.50pm in a quiet residential area outside a pub during half - time in a @entity109 match			0
' what became apparent during the investigation and from the evidence in the trial is that mr @entity13 had received a telephone call in the evening requesting him to go to the pub for a meeting			2
' that call was from a dirty phone which was used to deliberately lure him to the pub to be shot			0
' mr @entity97 added : ' the defendants have never volunteered any information to suggest what the motive was			0
actor : @entity6 can be seen performing in a play called ' 30 days in @entity124 ' back in 2008 brutal : the murder occurred outside the @entity47 pub in @entity127 , @entity109 , pictured , which is in a quiet residential area ' it would seem likely to me that mr @entity13 thought he was going to meet somebody he knew			1
' it 's entirely possible that was for some sort of illicit meeting but we really do n't know at this stage			0
' following the shooting , detectives launched a murder investigation and began by hunting for the getaway car , a red @entity143 estate , which had been spotted by witnesses and on @entity145			0
the next day , police stop - checked the vehicle in @entity148 and at the wheel was @entity6 alongside girlfriend @entity150			1
@entity6 initially told police he had not been anywhere near the area where the murder took place			1
but @entity150 's witness statement contained significant differences and detectives became suspicious			0
caught : @entity6 drove @entity66 , left , to the pub on the night of the murder			1
@entity33 , right , has been convicted of the murder the couple were arrested that night and @entity6 's efforts to distance himself from the shooting quickly unravelled			1
mr @entity97 said : ' the last thing the police need at the start of an investigation is somebody trying to wrong foot them			0
' that 's clearly what @entity6 's statements were intended to do			0
' fortunately , we were not wrong footed for too long but it is completely unacceptable to mislead the police at any time and certainly at the start of a murder investigation when time is so critical for us			0
' the jury was told that on the way to the police station , @entity6 said : ' i done nothing wrong and i did n't do anything willingly			2
' he also told detectives : ' i want to help you but i 'll be shot			0
' after giving evidence against his co-accused , the court ordered security be stepped up around @entity6 and that security guards sit between him and the rest of the defendants			1
he was also designated a ' vulnerable prisoner ' and placed in the isolation wing of his jail			1
popular : tv show @entity8 - which @entity6 starred in - was set in this residential close in @entity109 prisoner : @entity6 was found not guilty at @entity10 , pictured , over his role in the killing of @entity13 but he was jailed for perverting the course of justice mr @entity97 said the murder had left a ' devastating ' mark on mr @entity13 's family			1
' there is a six - year - old son who is going to grow up without knowing his dad and that is appalling , ' the detective added			1
' it is going to take an awful long time for them to come to terms with what 's happened			0
' @entity217 , the chief crown prosecutor for @entity218 , said : ' this was a ruthlessly planned and callously carried out execution of a 44 - year - old man in a quiet residential street in a suburban part of @entity109			1
' the whole circumstances of the offence are quite shocking			0
' the police and the @entity227 ( @entity227 ) will not spare any effort to investigate , prepare and pursue these cases and together we are absolutely committed to driving all organised crime and gun crime out of @entity218			0
