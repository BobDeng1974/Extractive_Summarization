but these professional beachscapes taken from a helicopter show the familiar scene of the family photo in a completely different light			2
photographer @entity12 took to the skies to achieve these dramatic aerial views of the world 's beaches , which he shot over a period of eighteen months			1
view from above : some of the aerial shots look directly down on the sunbathers from a distance			2
this shot has pulled away from the people and their sun loungers , turning them into dots on a canvas deep blue sea : @entity27 - based @entity12 traveled for 18 months while he worked on the project			1
he said his inspiration came from people playing in a swimming pool @entity33 worshipers : eye - catching patterns and shapes are created by colourful bikinis , towels and parasols against a backdrop of beige sand mr @entity12 took rides in 16 helicopters over six different continents to observe and photograph beach scenes			1
he said he was first inspired by sunbathers at a swimming pool			0
he then expanded the project to take in beachscapes			0
he said : ' i became mesmerised by the spectacle of hundreds of sunbathers and swimmers splashing around in this gigantic pool			0
i took a photo of the scene and it ended up being the creative spark that ignited the series			0
' in an interview with enpundit , mr @entity12 said : ' when i get up in the air and start looking down on those beautiful beaches and pools , i begin to start seeing the world as art. ' each geographic location is made up by the beautiful , vibrant patterns of many things , such as beach towels , surfboards , and umbrellas , all of which create repetition of shape and form			1
summer fun : the depths of the ocean are visible in this picture that shows the sea 's different shades of aquamarine where sand meets the sea : the dramatic contrast of pristine sand a murky sea makes for a memorable image ' as you begin to take a closer look at each candid image and study the interaction of people , you begin to find entertainment in what â€™s going on			0
' this project ' a la plage , a la piscine ' ( at the beach , at the pool ) aims to capture the colours and shapes that appear on the beach and the patterns that are created by sunbathers			0

the @entity27 - based photographer travelled to @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 to photograph some of the world 's most beautiful beaches			1
different way of looking : this rare shot of a deserted beach completes the project 's aim to capture the world 's beaches in different seasons sea of parasols : colour is added to this busy beach by vibrant red parasols			2
