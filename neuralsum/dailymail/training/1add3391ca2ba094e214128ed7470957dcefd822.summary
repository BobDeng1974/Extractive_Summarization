puff : the nation 's second - biggest tobacco company said it will begin selling @entity9 , a cigarette that uses a carbon tip that heats tobacco after being lit the surging e-cigarette or vapor industry has reinvigorated the interest for cigarette alternatives , including products like @entity9 and its predecessor @entity18 that smokers once considered foreign			1
even though the products left no lingering odor and did n't produce ashes , they tasted different than cigarettes and were more difficult to use			0
@entity18 had remained in limited distribution and is one of the top - selling brands in the cafeteria at @entity14 ' headquarters			1
' @entity40 - not - burn technology was 20 years ahead of when consumers were ready for it			0
it needed the mass presence of vapor products to open up an experience - base that smokers understood , ' said @entity49 , head of consumer marketing for the maker of @entity53 and @entity54 cigarettes			2
' the smoker could only compare heat - not - burn to a combustible and it lost every time			0
that 's no longer the case			0
' @entity9 is a ' modern take on the classic cigarette ' that — unlike popular e-cigarettes that use liquid nicotine — contains real tobacco , which could make them more attractive to cigarette smokers , @entity49 said			1
the brand is being launched with a marketing campaign that lets smokers know that it 's different and harder to use than traditional cigarettes but to ' stick with it , because it 's totally worth it , ' @entity49 said			2
@entity9 will cost about the same as a premium pack of regular cigarettes , which varies across the country but averages close to $ 6			2
smoke signals : @entity9 will cost about the same as a premium pack of regular cigarettes , which varies across the country but averages close to $ 6 with the health risks associated with traditional cigarettes and changes in societal expectations , it 's no wonder many of the world 's 1 billion smokers want to quit or try other tobacco alternatives			1
in the @entity93 , nearly half of the nation 's 42 million adult smokers try to quit each year , according to the @entity94			0
in more recent years , much of the attention to quitting has steered away from nicotine gum and patches to electronic cigarettes , which many smokers credit with helping them kick the habit			0
the company 's move follows that of overseas @entity106 maker @entity105 , which launched @entity107 and an accompanying device called @entity109 in a test market in @entity111 , @entity112 , earlier this month			0
the short , cigarette - like sticks are heated to maximum of 660 degrees @entity115 ( about 350 degrees @entity116 ) in the hollow pen - like device to create a tobacco - flavored nicotine vapor			1
@entity0 , based in @entity120 , @entity121 , has plans for another test market in @entity124 , with further expansion plans in 2015			0
it 's one of several so - called ' reduced - risk ' products @entity105 plans to test as the industry diversifies beyond traditional cigarettes amid declining demand			2
@entity105 and former parent company @entity132 , @entity134 - based @entity131 have agreed to share their technology for electronic cigarettes and other new alternatives to traditional cigarettes , so @entity139 could potentially be marketed in the @entity93 eventually .			0

the new cigarette , which will be called @entity9 , is a *rebranded* version of a @entity14 *’* product
that product *flopped* , but it believes @entity9 will appeal to smokers who do n*’*t like e-cigarettes but would like an alternative to traditional smoking
the cigarette comes with a carbon tip that , when lighted , heats the tobacco rather than burning it , so that the cigarette releases a tobacco - flavored vapor and not traditional cigarette smoke
