by @entity0 published : 14:39 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 20:34 est , 31 october 2013 snoring while pregnant raises the chances of having an underweight baby , experts warn			1
a study found that mothers - to - be who snore at least three nights a week are also more likely to need a caesarean section than those who sleep soundly			0
the researchers said treating mothers ’ sleep problems could help babies and cut care costs			0
mothers - to - be who snore are more likely to give birth to a small baby , a study has found previous research has already shown that women who start to snore during pregnancy are at risk of developing high blood pressure and the potentially dangerous pregnancy condition pre-eclampsia			1
more than a third of the 1,673 pregnant women recruited for the new @entity29 study reported habitual snoring			2
scientists found that women who snored in their sleep three or more nights per week had a higher risk of poor delivery outcomes , including smaller babies and @entity38 births			1
chronic snorers , who snored both before and during pregnancy , were two thirds more likely to have a baby whose weight was in the bottom 10 per cent			2
they were also more than twice as likely to need a caesarean delivery			0
dr @entity45 , from the @entity47 ’s @entity46 , said : ‘ there has been great interest in the implications of snoring during pregnancy and how it affects maternal health but there is little data on how it may impact the health of the baby			2
snoring during pregnancy is also linked to higher rates of caesarean delivery ‘ we ’ve found that chronic snoring is associated with both smaller babies and c - sections , even after we accounted for other risk factors			1
‘ this suggests that we have a window of opportunity to screen pregnant women for breathing problems during sleep that may put them at risk of poor delivery outcomes			1
’ snoring is a key sign of obstructive sleep apnoea , which results in the airway becoming partially blocked , said the researchers , whose findings appear in the journal @entity82			0
this can reduce blood oxygen levels during the night and is associated with serious health problems , including high blood pressure and heart attacks			1
sleep apnoea can be treated with @entity89 ( continuous positive airway pressure ) , which involves wearing a machine during sleep to keep the airways open			0
dr @entity45 added : ‘ if we can identify risks during pregnancy that can be treated , such as obstructive sleep apnoea , we can reduce the incidence of small babies , c - sections and possibly @entity102 ( neo-natal intensive care unit ) admission that not only improve long - term health benefits for newborns but also help keep costs down			0

snoring during pregnancy is also linked to higher rates of @entity38
women who snore during pregnancy are also at greater risk of developing high blood pressure and potentially dangerous pre-eclampsia
snoring may be a sign of breathing problems that could *deprive* an *unborn* baby of oxygen
