in the letter sent on mr @entity4 ’s behalf in september 1990 , the late president expressed his concerns as @entity39 employed thousands of people in @entity23 and @entity41			1
@entity45 ’s ( @entity44 ) collapse would hinder the finding of a lasting solution to the @entity41 question as both sides needed economies on a parity with each other , the court heard			0
the @entity23 finance minister @entity53 then wrote 16 days later to then foreign secretary @entity54 asking for more time to examine what support the @entity23 government could provide to @entity44			1

@entity23 wrote to then pm @entity24 , left , for help in securing @entity39 's future , but days later her foreign secretary @entity54 , right , issued an ultimatum demanding £ 100million in financing for the company , the court heard speaking for the first time since he returned to @entity8 in august 2010 to face trial , @entity4 said the decision to place his company in administration was taken as he was flying back to @entity8 from @entity23 before he managed to tell the board about the cash injection			1
he boasted of @entity39 : ' towards the middle of 1990 , it was one of the best - performing companies in the world			1
' @entity4 claimed the firm was not insolvent when it folded , saying : ‘ i think it had a tremendous future and this attitude was shared by the top brokers and investors in this country and worldwide			2
finance was available from @entity23			2
’ following the collapse of the conglomerate in 1990 with debts of £ 550million , @entity4 fled in a private plane as he faced trial for theft			1
he said his health was left ' in tatters ' after his offices were raided , his papers seized and mail tampered with with following the claim that he had tried to bribe a judge in his trial			0
' i was a totally broken man			0
my health was in tatters , my hope of a fair trial was in tatters , i had zero hope of receiving a fair trial			0
' he added : ' it was a frightening situation			0
i still remember the concerns and the fear the lordship [ @entity131 ] had in his face			0
' i had laid all my hopes on getting an independent trial but was very worried i would not			0
the judge 's expression was not one that one wants to see			2
' the corruption charges were later dropped			0
support : @entity4 , 71 , and his 28 - year - old second wife @entity139 , who watched from the back of the court			2
@entity4 was giving evidence five months after the trial began the tycoon spent nearly two decades in his native northern @entity41 after allegedly stealing millions to splash out on @entity146 mansions , country estates , antiques , race horses , fast cars and gifts for his family			2
but yesterday @entity4 insisted that he was ‘ not guilty ’ , suggesting the cash was sent to a subsidiary company in northern @entity41 to get better exchange rates when making new investments abroad			1
he claimed he had been the victim of injustice and said he had ‘ zero chance of a fair trial ’ after being accused of bribing a high court judge who was to oversee his trial back in 1993			0
an inquiry was launched into claims that there had been attempts to bribe mr @entity131 , jurors heard			2
but the @entity167 found there was no credible evidence to support the allegations			0
speaking haltingly , @entity4 was watched closely by his glamorous second wife @entity139 , 28 , yesterday as he told how his health was wrecked after being sued by the administrators of @entity39 , made bankrupt and put on trial			1
‘ i was a totally broken man			0
my health was in tatters , my hope of a fair trial was in tatters , i had zero hope of receiving a fair trial			0
