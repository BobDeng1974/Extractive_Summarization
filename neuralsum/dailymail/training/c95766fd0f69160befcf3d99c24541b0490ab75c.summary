at 24 years old , @entity1 candidate @entity0 is facing an uphill battle to win a seat in @entity4 long held by @entity5 , but his young age and party affiliation are the least of his problems			1
the baby - faced aspiring politician is currently on parole after serving prison time for a series of bizarre , sexually motivated break - ins he had committed in @entity16 - the same area he now seeks to represent in the @entity4			1
@entity0 ' criminal record includes trespassing on private and public property in four cases from april 2010 to january 2011 , when he was sent to prison			2
as part of the break - ins , he damaged vehicles as a way to enable what he told police was a sexual fetish			1
what a difference : @entity0 pictured left before he began serving a one - year term in @entity4 's state prison in october 2011 , and right this past april speaking against an @entity33 nondiscrimination ordinance his highly unusual proclivities had earned @entity0 two misdemeanor charges of unlawful use of a motor vehicle and destruction of property after the @entity16 man broke into a state parking lot , pulled spark plugs and wires out of police cruises and pleasured himself while cranking the engine			1
following his arrest in 2011 , @entity0 told investigators that he picked up the habit online			1
asked by @entity49 what drove him to commit these offenses , the 24 - year - old @entity1 replied : ' i was in a messed - up state of mind mentally and emotionally when i did what i did			2
that 's the only way i can even explain it			0
' @entity0 also reportedly enjoyed gratifying himself sexually inside stolen cop cars , trucks and once in a mosquito control car			2
but the fresh - faced political candidate who seeks to represent the 95th @entity61 insisted that he has turned a new leaf and has gone past the dark phase in his life when he was ' young and stupid			0
' conservative ex-con : @entity0 , 25 , is running as the sole @entity1 for 95th @entity67 seat three years after landing behind bars for breaking into and masturbating inside city police cars and trucks ‘ i feel that , yes , i ’ve made mistakes in my past			1
but i ’m working to correct those things and to try at least to put in my small part and help others in my community and try to make things right , ’ said @entity0			0
on his @entity79 page , @entity0 described himself as a ' pro-life , pro-family and freedom loving @entity83			0
' @entity85 @entity0 ' criminal history dates back to the time when he was arrested for a break - in at age 15 in @entity89			0
he spent the next six years going in and out of correctional facilities for trespassing and larceny			0
looking back on his desolate youth , @entity0 said he was a lonely , angry and bored kid in search of an adrenalin rush who belonged on the ' world 's dumbest criminals ' list			0
after moving to @entity4 in 2009 , @entity0 continued his petty - crime spree , which earned him a slew of misdemeanor charges for breaking into state vehicles , pulling out spark plug wires and masturbating to the sound of the running motor			1
in 2010 , @entity0 was sent to jail for 55 days and one - year probation , but ran afoul of the law just a few months after his release for joyriding and masturbating in police cruises and a city - owned pickup trucks			1
in september 2011 , @entity0 pleaded no contest to multiple counts of breaking and entering , unlawful driving and malicious destruction of property , and was sentenced to one year and eight months in prison			1
comeback kid : @entity0 , pictured here in march putting up signs endorsing @entity123 for attorney general , said he turned a new leaf while serving a year in prison and wants voters to give him a chance in retrospect , the aspiring state house representative has blamed his transgressions on his troubled family situation , having being raised without a father by his mother and grandmother			2
@entity0 said doing time in prison was his ultimate wake - up call – and also a call to action			2
‘ i 've realized that my gift that i have is in government and politics , ’ he said			0
‘ i 've found my niche , my passion			0
’ @entity0 ' parole will run out october 23 - just 11 days before @entity145			1
he hopes that voters will recognize that he has been working hard to correct his mistakes and give him a second chance by electing him into office			0
the 24 - year - old insisted that his life story is representative of real ' true red - blooded @entity83 conservatism ' - not the watered down version where @entity1 candidates emerge as ‘ whitewashed , ' perfect people			2
@entity0 went on to describe his core values as his ' stool of conservatism ' that stands on faith , family and freedom			0
as someone intimately familiar with the criminal justice system , the 24 - year - old said if elected , he plans to propose laws that would help former inmates find employment after release			0
the @entity170 who currently holds the 95th @entity67 seat that @entity0 is seeking is running for state @entity172			1
