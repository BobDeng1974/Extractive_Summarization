by @entity0 it ’s the toughest and most exclusive double in world football – winning the @entity3 and @entity4 in the same year			1
since 1992 when the @entity3 changed to its current format , only two players have achieved it out of thousands who have tried			2
@entity10 ( @entity9 and @entity11 1998 ) and @entity12 ( @entity9 and @entity13 , 2002 ) are the pair who made history , but others will try to take the first step to joining them when @entity9 and @entity21 play in the @entity3 final in @entity23 on may 24			1
path to glory : @entity10 was part of the @entity11 side that beat @entity13 3 - 0 in the @entity28 final heart - breaker : @entity12 takes a free - kick as @entity13 beat @entity31 2 - 1 in the 2002 @entity4 quarter - final four years ago , @entity33 came very close , winning the @entity3 with @entity35 ’s @entity34 before and reaching the @entity4 final , which his @entity38 team lost to @entity39			1
@entity41 ’s hopes of a double were ruined by his suspension for saturday ’s final but there are others who dare to dream			2
the odds on winning the @entity4 and @entity3 11/2 - @entity47 ( @entity9 and @entity13 ) of all the star names still in the running , @entity47 is the only one who can claim to play for both market leaders @entity9 and @entity13			1
his biggest task will be nailing down a place at left - back			0
he faces tough competition from @entity55 with @entity9 , and @entity56 for @entity13			1
in with a shout : @entity58 @entity47 vies for the ball against teammate @entity60 during friday 's training 8/1 - @entity63 @entity62 ( @entity9 and @entity64 ) has come good in the second half of the season to earn a place in the @entity9 side			0
@entity70 manager @entity69 , who is also spoilt for choice , will take him to the @entity4			0
he ’s got the unique joy of setting up chances for @entity75 for his club , and @entity77 for his country			0
coming of age : @entity81 's form has been vital in helping @entity9 reaching the @entity3 final 8/1 - @entity83 ( @entity9 and @entity84 ) missed five months of the season with a knee injury but has timed his return to perfection			1
would be a football fairytale if he emerged from the treatment room to win the two biggest trophies in the game			0
@entity41 ’s suspension gives him a better chance of playing in @entity23 on saturday			2
slice of luck : @entity83 may start in @entity23 after @entity41 was ruled out through suspension 10/1 - @entity100 and @entity101 ( @entity9 and @entity39 ) the pair were all part of @entity39 ’s @entity4 - winning team in 2010 and expect to go to @entity13 this summer			1
@entity100 is out of favour in @entity106 but he ’s the man to turn to for big occasions , @entity39 ’s captain and holder of three @entity3 winners ’ medals			0
@entity112 also plays for @entity9 and @entity39 but is less likely to feature			0
leading man : @entity100 has dropped down the pecking order at @entity9 in the last couple of seasons 11/1 – @entity117 ( @entity21 and @entity64 ) a right - winger whose loan move from @entity120 to @entity21 in january could n’t have worked out any better with a @entity106 title already in the bag and maybe more to follow			2
unlikely hero : @entity117 ( left ) tackles @entity126 's @entity125 as @entity21 pipped @entity126 to the league title 15/1 @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 ( @entity21 and @entity39 ) @entity131 is going to get a hostile reception in his home country of @entity13 having chosen to play international football for his adopted @entity39			1
but he wo n’t care if he arrives as the @entity106 and @entity3 winner with @entity21			2
injury threatens his appearance in @entity23 though			0
on the verge of greatness : striker @entity131 ( far right ) was pivotal in @entity21 's capture of the league title 33/1 - @entity142 and @entity143 ( @entity9 and @entity11 ) being left out of @entity11 ’s 2010 @entity4 squad did n’t do him any harm because the campaign ended in a players ’ ‘ strike ’ and early exit			1
since then he ’s been scoring goals in bucketloads for @entity9			0
@entity152 is rated the best young centre - half in the world			0
new lease : @entity142 had scored 22 goals in all competitions for @entity9 this season 35/1 - @entity75 , @entity55 and @entity158 ( @entity9 and @entity159 ) if @entity75 can pull off the @entity160 and help @entity159 win the @entity4 , he ’ll leapfrog @entity77 as the greatest player of his generation and possibly @entity163 and @entity164 as the greatest of all - time as well			1
@entity158 is among the best defenders in the world			0
unstoppable : @entity75 defies gravity as he controls the ball during @entity9 's match against @entity170 40/1 – @entity171 and @entity172 ( @entity21 and @entity173 ) @entity171 will leave @entity174 embarrassed if he ends up with one major trophy , let alone two , as they have allowed him to stay in @entity39 on loan			1
66/1 - @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 ( @entity21 and @entity180 ) even if they pull off a surprise on saturday , @entity182 ’s injury diminishes their @entity4 prospects			2
250/1 – @entity185 ( @entity9 and @entity186 ) he will pull the strings for @entity9 in the @entity3 final but it ’ll be a miracle if he ’ll emerge triumphant in @entity13 this summer , particularly with @entity186 facing the host nation first			1
old friends : @entity193 and @entity60 were teammates at @entity195 before finding their way to @entity9 ( * odds compiled by @entity198			0
have to play in both finals to count as a dream double			0

only two players have won the @entity3 and @entity4 in the same year
the likes of @entity75 , @entity131 and @entity41 will have the chance to do so this year
@entity9 and @entity21 play in the @entity3 final
the @entity13 @entity4 starts on *thursday* june 12
