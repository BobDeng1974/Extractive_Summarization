the extreme winter weather around the @entity2 will cause @entity3 to completely freeze over , an expert predicts			1
an estimated 91 per cent of its surface was covered in ice on february 6 , the most recent measurement , according to the @entity8			0
but @entity9 , associate professor at the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , believes that the lake , which has a surface area of 31,700 square miles and is the largest freshwater lake in the world , will freeze over before the arrival of spring			1
@entity3 has never had more than 91 per cent ice cover since records began ice one : @entity3 will completely freeze over by the end of the winter , an expert predicts monitoring : the ice cover for the @entity2 stood at 80 per cent as of february 2014 the last total freeze - over was in 1997			1
however there is now more ice on the lake than then , as it is thicker in the areas that have frozen already			0
its current ice cover equals the record set in 1994 , but that is about to be smashed , according to professor @entity9			2
the 40 - year average annual @entity3 ice coverage for february is just 30 per cent			2
prof @entity9 told @entity36 that there ’s a ‘ very high likelihood ’ that the lake will freeze in the imminent future , thanks to the longevity of this year ’s extreme temperatures			0
calm before the storm : @entity3 , the largest of the @entity2 system , is seen here before the winter storms hit according to an analysis by @entity49 's @entity8 , ice covered 78.7 percent of the @entity2 on february 6			2
not since early 1996 has ice been so widespread on the @entity2			0
seen here is @entity3 at 4.22 pm local time on february 7 , 2014 he pointed out that the mercury did n’t rise above zero in @entity11 , which sits on the edge of @entity3 , for 23 days in a row recently , breaking the 1936 record of 22 days			0
@entity58 , who has been tracking @entity2 ice for the @entity60 since 1973 , said this winter has had among the most rapid ice buildups of his tenure			2
@entity3 is the largest freshwater lake in the world with a surface area of 31,700 square miles air temperatures show this is the coldest winter since 1979 , according to @entity68			1
the widespread ice in january and early february this year ' would n't have been anomalous back in the ' 70s or with some of the winters in the mid- ' 90s '			0
' but it certainly has been a while since we 've seen this much ice this early , ' @entity58 said			0
the extent of the freeze comes despite warnings from scientists that climate change was causing the lake to become warmer			1
a study in 2007 suggested that the long - term trend was for higher air temperatures in summer over the lake , and less ice in winter on it .			1

the ice cover on @entity3 currently stands at 91 per cent
*superior* is the largest freshwater lake in the world at 31,700 square miles
an expert from the @entity10 believes it could freeze over
ice is covering 80 per cent of the @entity2 at present
air temperatures show this is the coldest winter since 1979
last total freeze was 1997 - but climate change scientists had said lake was getting warmer
