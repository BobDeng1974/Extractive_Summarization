by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 today publicly slapped down @entity3 for issuing ' threats ' to leave @entity5 if he does not get his way over choosing the @entity8 president			1
mr @entity3 was at a summit in @entity1 trying to drum up support to block @entity11 - an arch pro-european who is the front runner for the top job			1
he fears that the former @entity16 prime minister is not open to reform of the @entity18 , and has suggested appointing him could send @entity19 drifting towards exit door in the in - out referendum he has promised for 2017			1
@entity23 chancellor @entity2 this morning warned @entity3 not to make threats in his bid to overhaul @entity19 's relationship with @entity27 mrs @entity2 insisted she was still backing @entity11 to be president of the @entity8 , but urged other leaders to act in a ' @entity5 spirit ' mrs @entity2 issued the warning at a joint press conference hosted by @entity34 prime minister @entity33 but mrs @entity2 - who has publicly backed mr @entity11 , but is privately said to be sensitive to @entity19 's concerns - rebuked mr @entity3 for being too heavy - handed and not acting in the ‘ @entity5 spirit ’			1
when the prime minister was asked if he had threatened to leave the @entity18 , at a press conference in @entity38 , the @entity34 prime minister 's country residence , mrs @entity2 cut in			2
she said : ' i made myself clear by saying that i am for @entity11			2
but when i made that statement in @entity23 i also made the point that we act in a @entity5 spirit			1
‘ we always do that because otherwise you would never reach a compromise ... threats are not part and parcel of that spirit			0
that is not part of the way in which we usually proceed			0
' it was a snub for mr @entity3 who is understood to have hit out at mr @entity11 's suitability for the role at the leaders dinner on monday night			1
the four leaders agreed that whoever the next commissioner is , a commitment to tackle benefit tourism must be top of their agenda			2
the commissioner 's programme is written in the next few months and they plan to convince the other 24 national leaders that protecting country 's social security systems from the freedom of movement rules must be on it			2
tensions were laid bare during the joint press conference between @entity75 prime minister @entity74 , @entity23 chancellor @entity2 , @entity34 prime minister , @entity33 and @entity19 prime minister @entity3 , at the summer residence , @entity38 , south of @entity78 , @entity1 the four @entity5 leaders posed first on a boat and later at lecterns in the sunshine , keen to present a united front			1
but behind the scenes there remain deep divisions about who will run the @entity8			0
last night they dined on smoked salmon tartare , followed by roast filet of beef with bacon and morel ragu and for dessert , elderflower semifredo strawberry compote with meringue and strawberries			0
the public spat over @entity11 will leave an unpleasant taste in the mouth			0
mr @entity3 attending the mini summit in the @entity34 countryside , with mrs @entity2 , the @entity34 prime minister @entity33 and @entity75 prime minister @entity74 , all @entity18 reformers			1
the foursome enjoyed a scenic boat trip on a balmy monday evening in matching life jackets , then an intimate meal at the residence , where mr @entity3 told them allowing mr @entity11 to have the role would be a ' stitch up ' by the @entity112 and would set a ‘ dangerous precedent ’ for the future			1
the leaders nailed down their priorities for reform and who would best fulfil them			0
a clampdown on benefit tourism is a top priority , along with jobs and growth , cutting red tape for businesses and completing the single market in energy			0
@entity129 sources say there are ‘ high quality ’ alternative candidates mr @entity3 would support			2
they are thought to include the @entity134 prime minister @entity133 , who featured in a selfie with mr @entity3 and @entity136 last year in @entity137			0
@entity138 , the head of the @entity139 has ruled herself out , but would be a popular choice for many , and @entity142 president @entity141 , a free marketer who models herself on @entity146			0
last night the leaders helds talks in a rowing boat , a tradition for all visitors to the rural retreat in @entity38 despite the display of bonhomie , there remain major differences between mrs @entity2 and the other leaders on the future leadership of the @entity8 @entity1 ’s mr @entity33 boosted mr @entity3 ’s hopes yesterday this week by saying he agreed that national leaders , not @entity161 should pick the @entity8 president			1
mr @entity3 said after the summit that he wanted @entity19 to stay in a reformed @entity18 , and would leave the decision to a referendum			1
but he added : ‘ obviously the approach that the @entity18 takes between now and then will be very important			0
if we can achieve reforms , if we can demonstrate openness , competitiveness , flexibility , less interference , reform - if people are capable of taking the @entity18 forward in that direction that will be helpful			2
obviously if the @entity18 does n't go in that direction that would be very unhelpful			0
’ labour leader @entity177 and @entity178 have both backed mr @entity3 ’s bid to block mr @entity11 , and he is thought to have support from other leaders including @entity183 prime minister @entity182			1
mr @entity11 emerged as the front runner because he was picked earlier this year by @entity161 from the @entity186 group - which won the most seats in the @entity112 , but still only took less than a third			0
@entity2 is pushing for arch - federalist @entity11 ( left ) to become the new @entity8 president , but @entity139 chief @entity138 ( second left ) has emerged as a compromise candidate favoured by @entity3			1
other politicians in line for @entity5 's most powerful position include @entity134 pm @entity133 and @entity195 taoiseach @entity194 @entity11 is the favourite to become the new @entity8 president - replacing the outgoing former @entity199 prime minister @entity198			1
the former @entity16 prime minister was chosen as the candidate for the top job by the @entity112 's main conservative group , the @entity186			1
the @entity186 emerged from last week 's elections with the most seats - leaving mr @entity11 in poll position for the @entity18 's most powerful job			1
but the @entity8 president is chosen by @entity5 leaders including @entity3 - and not by the @entity112			1
@entity161 do however have to confirm the leaders ' choice for the job in a vote			0
the other candidates for the top @entity18 job include the @entity139 chief @entity138			2
miss @entity138 was finance minister under former president @entity216 before moving to the @entity139 at the height of the euro zone 's debt crisis in 2011 to replace disgraced @entity221 politician @entity220			0
her term runs until 2016			0
a fluent @entity224 - speaker who headed a major @entity226 law firm before holding ministerial office in @entity221 , she is highly regarded by @entity23 leader @entity2			0
center - left @entity134 prime minister @entity133 is also under consideration			0
the former @entity161 is the daughter - in - law of @entity230 , the ex @entity231 leader and @entity5 commissioner			0
if mrs @entity2 was open to a @entity221 candidate for one of the top jobs , @entity233 might offer @entity237 former prime minister @entity238 - a fluent @entity23 - speaker who was replaced in march but is well regarded in @entity239			1
another candidate for the @entity8 president is the current @entity195 taoiseach @entity194			2
the @entity243 leader became @entity195 's leader in 2011 , so might be open to moving to @entity27 .			2

@entity23 chancellor says threat to walk out ' not in @entity5 spirit '
she *reiterates* support for former @entity16 pm @entity11
@entity11 is the leading candidate to become next @entity8 chief
but @entity3 says @entity5 leaders must choose top jobs in @entity27
row threatens to *undermine* @entity11 's bid to reform @entity19 's relationship with @entity18
