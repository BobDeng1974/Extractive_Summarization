when the worst floods in a generation hit the banks of the @entity4 in january , most people got out their mops and buckets			1
however , @entity7 had a more ambitious idea			1
the 58 - year - old and his family live on an island between the @entity4 and an artificial water channel , which means they are vulnerable to flooding , and they , too , suffered the heartbreak of their home being inundated			1
and so , determined not to go through the agonising misery and financial expense again , the telecoms consultant decided to raise his five - bedroom house 4½ft up in the air — and fill in the resulting gap with breeze blocks			1
now , after three months , the job is almost complete			2
the lifting has been finished , but the front and back doors are still suspended nearly 5ft up in mid-air — accessible only by climbing a pile of teetering breeze blocks			2
and the old ground floor of the house in @entity28 , @entity29 , is a newly created basement			1
today , @entity7 , a dynamo of a man , is busy overseeing every last detail of his grand dream			1
it ’s a family affair as his son @entity54 , a medical student on his summer holiday , carts building materials around the site in a wheelbarrow			2
by the end of next month , the house will be as good as new , except for the insertion of a huge floodable basement on which the house will rest			2
and it will enjoy even more dramatic views across the @entity4 to @entity63 , where @entity64 was signed in 1215			0
not only will the house be safe from future floods , the family will have benefited financially			1
before the flood , which caused £ 125,000 in damage , the house was worth £ 1 million			1
after the flood , though , its value had , understandably , dropped to £ 750,000			2
now , after the @entity75 spent £ 70,000 on the lifting project , it ’s worth between £ 1.5 million and £ 2 million			1
such a turnaround seemed a near impossibility just a few months ago			2
when the flood waters arrived , the family ’s ground floor was wrecked — the hardwood floor , walls and electrics all damaged beyond repair			1
‘ after the flood , we had to think of a way to protect the property , ’ says mr @entity7 , who has lived in the house with his wife and two sons for 15 years			1
being self - employed , he was unable to work after the floods hit			1
‘ it ’s taken months of my life , plus all the cost of renovation , so i made a decision that we could n’t allow it to happen again			2
’ danger : the five - bedroom home is at great risk of flooding due to its position on an island of desirable properties between the @entity4 and a water channel first , he considered sealing the house with a barrier fitted all around with waterproof doors and powerful pumps that would get rid of any ground water and leakage			1
‘ but then i realised that would n’t be enough , ’ he says			0
‘ @entity116 will find its way in through the tiniest crack			0
and all you need is one leak			0
’ mr @entity7 then considered a demolition and rebuild job , but it would have cost £ 500,000			1
and so he devised a radical plan : to lift the house in one great piece above the flood area altogether , for a fraction of the price			2
planning permission was surprisingly easy to get			0
at first , mr @entity7 sought only to raise the house by 3ft — but the @entity131 objected , saying it should be raised by 4½ft to be sure of avoiding flood damage			1
council officials were sympathetic , too			0
as for the neighbours , they have been supportive and full of admiration because they might now follow this example			2
and so specialist builders — more used to lifting 6,000 - ton bridges than family homes — set to work			1
first , a cat ’s cradle of steel beams was created underneath the house			2
this web of metal — 250 beams altogether and weighing 14 tons — would bear the weight of the house when it began to move			2
beams were erected within the building , just under the concrete ground floor ( the carpet and floorboards had been destroyed by water and had already been ripped out )			1
through holes punched in the brick walls , the beams within connected to more beams ringing the house ’s exterior — a design that stabilised the metal framework			2
@entity162 plans : the family has spent three months and £ 70,000 lifting the 80 - ton building away from harm using 28 super-strong jacks , each capable of supporting 50 tons then , 28 super-strong jacks — each capable of supporting 50 tons — were placed underneath the steel cradle			1
a diamond - edged saw then sliced horizontally through all the brick walls below the level of the concrete floors , severing the building from its foundations			2
the idea was that , with the perimeter ring of steel steadying the structure and pressure spread evenly over the jacks , no one part of the building would be exposed to particular stress as it was raised			2
if all went to plan , this would keep it in one piece			0
finally , all the windows and walls were braced with timber beams to help ease any internal strains			0
so now the house was ready to be lifted heavenwards			0
but putting engineering theory into practice was a nerve - racking experience			0
with each click of the hydraulic jacks , the building started to move up by millimetres , as the @entity75 ( who are living in rented accommodation while the project is completed ) looked on			0
the family ’s possessions remained inside the house			1
slowly and silently , their home climbed into the air — but dramatically enough that you could see the tiny little jumps it made with each click of the jacks			0
‘ i was terrified , ’ says mrs @entity212			0
‘ it was n’t just the house we were lifting , but everything we had inside			1
it moved very slowly and quietly — just like the flood			0
’ as the jacks pushed the house higher , they were wrapped in metal reinforcement jackets of increasing height to help to support the weight			0
and as those jacks clicked away — raising the house a few inches every hour — computers tracked how high they were climbing			0
innovation : the new breeze block basement will be wrapped in bricks and partly concealed by decking as it can not be used for residential purposes ‘ it was crucial that all the jacks raised the house at the same rate , ’ says mr @entity7			1
‘ just a 10mm discrepancy between one side of the house and the other would have meant the whole thing would have cracked , causing irreparable structural damage			0
’ once the house had been raised the full 4½ feet , this house on stilts resembled something more likely to be seen in the hurricane vulnerable areas of @entity249 ’s @entity248 , where such solutions are commonplace			1
over the past week , however , the newly formed gap at the bottom of this @entity29 house has been filled with breeze blocks			1
the spaces in the brickwork , where the steel beams poke out , will soon be filled with a dry mix of sand and cement			0
once this has set , the jacks will be removed and the steel cradle will be dismantled and taken away			0
the new breeze block basement will be wrapped in bricks and part concealed by decking on the house ’s riverside front			0
under @entity131 rules , the new basement can not be used for residential purposes			0
mr @entity7 jokes that he will store a @entity271 there but , in fact , it will have to be left empty			1
thinking back to the start of the project , mr @entity7 says : ‘ it was very sad			1
it did n’t feel like a home any more , and it was terrible taking it all apart			0
what was a family home had become a project			1
but it will become a family home again			1
‘ it makes sense , ’ she says			0
‘ it ’s easy to forget how terrible the flooding was			0
my husband was very stressed			0
the flooding was so bad that some of our neighbours never returned to their homes			1
’ taking action : some of their neighbours never returned home after the floods , the worst of which came in january and sent the cost of home insurance sky high building plots nearby have become worthless			1
insurance firms wo n’t cover new houses in the area			0
mr @entity7 received £ 125,000 in compensation for the flood damage very quickly — but could see that he would have difficulty getting a new policy			1
‘ i was very happy with the insurers , ’ he says			0
‘ but they would n’t insure me once my policy runs out , and i can see why			0
at the moment , my insurance is £ 50 or £ 60 a month			0
after the floods , it would be £ 10,000 a year			2
’ and so what will happen to houses on flood plains across the country if , as some are predicting , flooding gets worse in years to come ? some houses will be abandoned by those who ca n’t afford the higher insurance premiums			0
other owners , after the @entity75 ’ example , will surely consider lifting their homes towards the clouds			0
‘ if my idea spreads , then many other houses will be saved , ’ says mr @entity7 , the man who took on the forces of nature — and won .			2

@entity7 and his family live in five - bedroom home on a island between water channels in @entity28 , @entity29
their house was *gutted* by floods , worst of all in january , when many of his neighbours could *n't* return home
in bid to beat the frequent flooding , the family have spent three months and £ 70,000 lifting the house on to stilts
after the work raised the house four and a half feet off ground , experts estimate it *'s* now worth up to £ *2million*
