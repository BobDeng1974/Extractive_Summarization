the couple had n't spent a night apart until a mix - up at the @entity21 care home they were living in ' that 's my girl ' : a picture of @entity16 aged 20 that @entity7 took to war and carried it in his rucksack and the former prisoner of war , aged 26 happily married : @entity8 and @entity7 , who met during the war , on their wedding day in 1945 mrs @entity16 tried to return but her place had been taken			1
it meant the couple , who met during the war , had to live apart			0

mrs @entity16 at @entity23 in @entity21 , seven months ago she discharged herself and was n't able to go back ' @entity7 and i have been through everything together and we had not been parted since the war			1
' i remember conditions at the pow camp were awful , no proper food , clothes and he had lost so much weight that it was like @entity67			0
' when i went to see him he was so thin and wearing an @entity69 uniform that i did n't recognise him			0
' he had to carry a cushion round with him to make him look heavier than he actually was			0
from then on i vowed he would never go hungry again			0
' i got him fit and every night i fed him meat and vegetables			2
since the war we 've been utterly devoted to each other and it was hell when we split up - although we do n't blame the care home			2
we are just so happy to be back together			0
' mr and mrs @entity16 met at a dance in @entity82 in 1942			1
@entity7 who trained paratrooopers was stationed there with the @entity85 and @entity8 worked in the land army			0

he fought in the @entity91 where 100 tanks went out and the @entity93 wiped them all out but seven			0
after that he was sent to @entity94 and trained to jump			0
he himself trained a group of @entity13 airmen to jump over @entity98 in @entity21 and they dropped with him at the @entity99 as dozens of his colleagues were shot down mr @entity7 landed and hid under a dead airman as the @entity93 walked by , then he heard the click , all clear @entity93 gone			1

mr @entity7 kept notes of the great trek and still keeps the two very worn sheets written in pencil with how far they had marched each day			2
they walked with very little food , hardly any clothing and were covered in lice when they arrived			0
on arrival at @entity12 he discovered someone had found his photo and pinned it up on the door of one of the cells			0
mr @entity7 saw it and said ' that 's my girl ' - something he still says today when he sees that picture			2

@entity7 and @entity16 had n't spent night away from each other since 1945
they were living together at a care home in @entity20 , @entity21
but when mrs @entity16 discharged herself there was a *misunderstanding*
she left expecting him to follow , but mr @entity7 was n't in a fit enough state
mrs @entity16 could n't return because her place had been taken
a charity have now raised the money to fund couple elsewhere
at last the pair are back together under the same roof
