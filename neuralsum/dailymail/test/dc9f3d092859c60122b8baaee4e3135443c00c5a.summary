@entity1 manager @entity0 admitted that @entity2 were superior to his side ' in virtually every department ' as he saw his team slump to a 3 - 1 defeat in the first leg of the quarter - final at the @entity9			1
an early strike from @entity11 and second - half brace from @entity13 sealed victory for @entity2 and placed the @entity16 outfit into a commanding position ahead of the return at the @entity19 on tuesday			1
@entity0 admitted his side felt the absence of the suspended @entity21 and @entity22 , while @entity1 were also unable to start with @entity23 and saw @entity24 hobble off in the early stages			1
@entity13 eases past @entity23 en route to scoring his second goal of the @entity29 tie @entity30 leads the celebrations after @entity2 secured a 3 - 1 victory in @entity33 on wednesday night ' i 'm not going to make excuses about us being depleted , ' said @entity0			1
' i 'm not doing that			0
we put a team out there , but we were dominated by @entity2			1
' it 's only six days until the second leg , with a league game in between , so it 's a ' short week ' for people to recover			2
i think @entity2 were fitter than us			2
we had players who were n't at 100 per cent , and also a lot of absentees , but that should have been a motivation for us			0
we never controlled the ball well enough , and @entity2 were better than us in virtually every department			2
' we will have the suspended players back next week , and that is an incentive			0
we 'll try and put on a better show than we did tonight			0
they were better than us tonight and scored three goals			0
we 'll try and show a different @entity1 at @entity2 next week			1
hopefully we will achieve a different result			0
' @entity0 made no excuses for his side as they now face elimination from the @entity29 @entity23 , who started the game from the substitutes ' bench , endured a night to forget in the @entity67 capital in the end , the @entity67 was relieved to escape only 3 - 1 down			1
' it did n't end up as bad as it might have done , but the players are very disappointed with the way it went , ' he said			0
' we gave the impression we gave @entity2 the kind of game they wanted to pay			2
they made life difficult for us on the counter-attack and have players who can be very dangerous			0
' @entity2 manager @entity82 was delighted with his side 's showing and reserved special praise for @entity13			1
' @entity13 is special in his own way , ' @entity82 said , ' look at the goals he scored for @entity88 and @entity89			1
he is very strong and finishes so well			0
but it was n't just about @entity13 tonight			2
we were superb in defence , midfield and attack			0
