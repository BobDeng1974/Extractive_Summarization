by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:40 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 12:54 est , 22 august 2013 they 're called ' super agers ' - men and women who are in their 80s and 90s , but with brains and memories that seem far younger			1
@entity10 researchers are looking at this rare group in the hope that they may find ways to help protect others from memory loss			1
neuroscientists have become excited , as imaging tests have revealed unusually low amounts of age - related plaques along with more brain mass related to attention and memory in these elite seniors			1
92 - year - old @entity24 holds a photo of her father in her studio apartment at a retirement home in @entity29			1
she is one of the ' super agers ' being studied with ' young ' brains and memories to help scientists find ways to help protect others from memory loss ' we 're living long but we 're not necessarily living well in our older years and so we hope that the @entity39 study can find factors that are modifiable and that we 'll be able to use those to help people live long and live well , ' said study leader @entity43 , a neuroscientist at @entity45 's cognitive neurology and @entity47 's disease centre in @entity29			1
the study is still seeking volunteers , but fewer than 10 per cent of would - be participants have met study criteria			1
dr @entity43 said : ' we 've screened over 400 people at this point and only about 35 of them have been eligible for this study , so it really represents a rare portion of the population			1
' they include an octogenarian attorney , a 96 - year - old retired neuroscientist , a 92 - year - old @entity62 survivor and an 81 - year - old pack - a - day smoker who drinks a nightly martini			1
to qualify , would - be participants have to undergo a battery of mental tests			1
once enrolled , they have periodic imaging scans and other medical tests			0
critically , they also must be willing to donate their brains after death			2
neuroscientists have become excited as imaging tests have revealed unusually low amounts of age - related plaques - along with more brain mass related to attention and memory - in elderly people such as ms @entity24 ( pictured ) who works in the gift shop at her retirement home in @entity29 the memory tests include lists of about 15 words and dr @entity43 said ' super agers can remember at least nine of them 30 minutes later , which is really impressive because often older adults in their 80s can only remember just a couple			1
' special mri scans have yielded other remarkable clues , dr @entity43 said			0
they show that in super agers , the brain 's cortex , or outer layer , responsible for many mental functions including memory , is thicker than in typical 80 and 90 - year - olds			1
deep within the brain , a small region called the anterior cingulate , which is important for attention , is bigger than in many 50 and 60 - year - olds			1
the super agers are n't just different on the inside ; they have more energy than most people their age and share a positive , inquisitive outlook , according to the scientists			1
dr @entity43 said the researchers are looking into whether those traits contribute to brain health and other research has linked a positive attitude with overall health			2
dr @entity43 said the project has screened over 400 people willing to participate in the study but only about 35 of them have been eligible for this study , so it really represents a rare portion of the population			1
ms @entity24 , a @entity62 survivor , was chosen			0
she says she finds it easy to recall conversations and feels young some studies have suggested that people who are ' cognitively active and socially engaged ' have a reduced chance of developing alzheimer 's disease , but scientists do not know which comes first - a healthy brain or a great attitude , according to @entity139 , director of medical and scientific operations for the @entity140			1
dr @entity139 said the super ageing study is an important effort that may help provide some answers			2
@entity24 is among the super agers			0
the petite woman looks far younger than her 92 years , and is a vibrant presence at her @entity29 retirement home , where she acts as a sort of room mother , volunteering in the gift shop , helping residents settle in and making sure their needs are met			0
@entity152 lost most of her family in the holocaust and takes her work seriously			0
' what i could n't do for my parents , i try to do for the residents in the home , ' she said , her voice still thick with the accent of her native @entity163			0
@entity152 acknowledges she 's different from most people at the home , even many younger residents			2
' i am young - inside			2
and i think that 's the difference , ' she said			0
' i grasp fast ... if people say something , they do n't have to tell me twice			2
i do n't forget it			0
' the study has shown that super agers like ms @entity24 ( pictured right ) tend to have a larger ' anterior cingulate ' in the brain that is important for attention than many 50 - year - olds			1
they also have more energy than most people their age and share a positive , inquisitive outlook she 's different in other ways , too and said : ' when you get old , people are mainly interested in themselves			1
' they talk about the doctor , what hurts ... you are not so important that you just concentrate on yourself			0
you have to think about other people			2
' study participant @entity191 has a similar mindset			2
the 85 - year - old retired businessman does n't think of himself as a super ager			1
' neither do my children , ' he says , chuckling			0
but mr @entity191 says his memory has been sharp ' from the time i was born			2
my mother used to say , " @entity202 , come sing with me " - not because i had a good voice , but because i always knew the words , ' he said			0
' i think i 'm just lucky , not only with respect to my memory , but i 'm able to get around very well ; i walk a lot and i have a pretty good attitude toward life itself			0
' @entity191 volunteers several hours a week at a food pantry run by the @entity29 church where he is a parishioner			0
ms @entity24 walks through the cafeteria at her retirement home in @entity29 and is participating in the research			0
scientists hope the @entity39 study can find factors that are modifiable and that the findings will help people live long and live well @entity220 , of @entity221 , is another super ager			1
he had ' more than an inkling he might qualify for the study , and his kids encouraged him to enroll			0
' they said , " @entity230 , your brain is the best thing about you , " ' the 81 - year - old retired businessman recalled			1
he 's a golfer and @entity235 musical ' nut ' who created a 300 - plus - page computer database of shows			0
mr @entity220 uses an @entity238 , recently went hot - air ballooning and is trying to learn @entity240			0
he also pours himself a vodka martini every night and is a pack - a - day cigarette smoker , but says he does n't think his habits have made much difference			0
his healthy brain , he says , may be due to heredity and genes , but @entity220 said he hopes the study comes up with more ' scientific insights '			2
' my dad lived into his middle 90s and was pretty sharp right up until the day he died , ' mr @entity220 said			0
his motivation for joining the study was simple : the best man at his wedding died of alzheimer 's disease before age 50			2
' to lose a mind ... is just a terrible way to go , ' he said .			0

@entity10 researchers are studying 80 and 90 - year - olds with exceptional brains and memories to find ways to protect others from memory loss
@entity45 scientists found low amounts of age - related plaques plus more brain mass related to memory in the participants
the neuroscientists have screened over 400 people for the study and only about 35 people have been eligible
