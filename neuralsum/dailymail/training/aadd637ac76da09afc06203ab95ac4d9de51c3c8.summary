by @entity0 published : 05:28 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 07:08 est , 12 april 2013 post-sandwich guilt may become a thing of the past thanks to a baker who has created the @entity6 's lowest calorie bread			1
the @entity10 - based @entity9 banker - turned - baker has launched @entity11 - a unique sandwich delivery business that provides a virtually carb - free , low calorie super-bread ... made from broccoli			1
@entity14 , who was made redundant from his trader job at @entity16 last year , decided to leave the bright lights of the @entity9 behind him once and for all , and turn his hand to baking			1
a dieter 's dream : using all natural produce and broccoli as the main ingredient , @entity14 created the lowest carb bread in the @entity6 banker turned baker : despite having no baking experience , former banker @entity14 taught himself how to make the lowest carb bread in the @entity6 despite having no experience in oven - based work , the 27 - year - old set himself the challenge of creating the world 's healthiest bread			1
he spent hours poring over books in the @entity37 , studying the latest medical research on how food is stored as fat , and meticulously devised more than 150 prototypes before arriving at @entity43 's secret recipe			1
using all natural produce and broccoli as the main ingredient , @entity14 created the lowest carb bread in the @entity6 - as accredited by @entity45 ( @entity45 )			1
@entity43 's special recipe has 50 per cent fewer calories and 94 per cent fewer carbs than other popular breads			1
low carb : after hours of perfection , @entity43 's special recipe has 50 per cent fewer calories and 94 per cent fewer carbs than other popular breads as a comparison , 100g of popular , supermarket - bought seeded loaves have 300 calories and 34g of carbohydrate , while 100g of @entity14 's bread has only 137 calories and just 2g of carbohydrate			1
the bread will appeal to the likes of super health - conscious @entity63 , because it is also gluten - free , soy - free , and almost zero @entity66			2
@entity14 , who is based in central @entity10 , has spent much of the last six months rising at 2am to bake for the day ahead conducting an extensive testing and sampling programme to ensure that his recipe is perfect			1
early riser : @entity14 has spent much of the last six months rising at 2am to bake for the day ahead speaking about his exciting new business venture , @entity14 said : ' in my old job , i always felt guilty eating unhealthy sandwiches at lunchtime			2
' i discovered that my colleagues had cut them out of their diet , with no alternatives available			0
we all thought , surely there must be a better way			0
' that 's really how @entity43 was born - the aim of the venture was always to find a truly healthy alternative to the high street sandwich , where no low carbohydrate option was available			1
' it was n't until i started baking that more and more mates started mentioning that they no longer eat bread			2
' gluten intolerance was also far more prevalent than i had realised			0
zero gluten then became a key idea behind the product as well , and i feel really pleased that the sandwiches will be available to as many people as possible , not excluding anyone			0
' he continued : ' some people thought i was mad , and , to be honest , at times i did feel a little like an alchemist			0
but i was always confident in the science behind the process , and am thrilled to have found a result which people are now enjoying			0
' we have been very encouraged by the initial feedback to the business and product and will be looking to expand our menu and delivery area throughout 2013			0
' @entity43 delivers platters and individual sandwiches to addresses across @entity115 and @entity10 as well as catering for larger corporate events and supplying office canteens			1
each sandwich is priced between £ 3.75 and £ 4.50 and @entity14 plans to open a series of sandwich shops around @entity10 then look to move to outside @entity10 once established			1
he added : ' the plan is also to greatly expand the range of products			0
firstly we are working on a greater line of breads ( red cabbage , courgette and some others are in the test stage at the moment )			2
' then want to move on to other bread like products namely pizzas			0
' if there was one food i had to eat forever it would be bread			0
so when i found out about @entity11 i was more than excited at the prospect of being able to do ' carbs before marbs '			0
but with broccoli as the key ingredient , could this really taste as good as a classic hunk of @entity147 ? after getting over the bread 's slightly green tinge , i tucked in			2
what can only be described as a cross between an omelet and brioche , with more bites , the bread tasted really good			0
and the best part ? the sandwich was crammed full of fresh poached salmon , watercress and a light mayonnaise sauce all for just 219 calories ( a @entity163 's equivalent would see you devour over 800 calories )			2
it may not taste as good as a crisp petite pan with slatherings of butter , but this is the perfect lunchtime fix for dieters who are partial to committing the occasional carbicide .			0
