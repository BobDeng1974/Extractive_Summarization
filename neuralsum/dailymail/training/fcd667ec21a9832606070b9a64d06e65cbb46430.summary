a number of @entity2 countries have already contacted @entity3 about possible training bases for the 2018 @entity5 , despite it being under two months since the 2014 final			1
and this ultra-forward planning comes at a time when @entity10 diplomats are supporting a boycott of the tournament in @entity13 as an effective protest from the @entity15 over @entity17 ’s military stance over @entity18			2
@entity19 is also said to back the recommendations to suspend @entity13 from high profile sporting events , including the @entity5 , in an options paper being circulated around the @entity2 capitals			2
pressure : @entity26 president @entity25 will face tough questions about @entity13 's political stance but @entity26 ’s national teams have no intention of becoming involved in the politics , as shown by @entity32 and @entity34 ’s football federations who are understood to have already started their preparations for the tournament			1
the @entity38 , currently finalising their preferred bases for @entity40 , have yet to turn their attention to @entity13			0
and @entity13 ’s planning for the event , unlike the chaotic build - up to @entity43 2014 and the continuing concern over @entity45 , is already well advanced			2
this includes laying on extra flights to the more remote @entity5 venues			0
the qualifying draw will take place in @entity53 next july			0
@entity19 was part of the @entity38 delegation in @entity56 that attracted just one vote from outside the @entity58 for the 2018 @entity5 to be held in @entity59			1
decision makers : prime minister @entity19 greets @entity3 president @entity61 outside 10 @entity62 in 2010 , as part of @entity59 's bid for the 2018 @entity5 in his @entity67 lecture on thursday night , @entity65 called for the @entity69 urn to be retained by the victorious team , despite the original artefact being far too fragile to leave the @entity72 since going on tour to @entity74 in 2006 - 07			1
@entity65 also revealed pm @entity19 had promised to get back to him over schools sport but had never done so			0
@entity76 : the original @entity69 urn is too fragile to leave the @entity72 in @entity78 @entity80 backers @entity81 came to the rescue of @entity84 club @entity83 , whose players ’ boots were stolen , by providing new footwear			1
but the gesture only serves to highlight the conflict of bookmaker sponsorship in football			0
@entity83 ’s former managing director @entity92 is banned from all football activity for 21 months for multiple breaches of football betting regulations			0
@entity96 will find @entity97 only willing to talk to their cameras when they are contractually obliged to , following the club ’s upset at the network continuing to broadcast sacked head coach @entity103 ’s compensation at £ 10,000 , despite being informed by @entity97 it was n’t correct			1
@entity97 have still to settle with @entity103 but the number is likely to be a lot nearer six figures			2
short stay : @entity103 lasted just six games in charge at @entity97 before being sacked bookies play with fire @entity113 , the most rabid of bookmaker publicists , have added to the growing consternation at the way @entity96 have turned transfer deadline day into an unedifying circus			1
@entity113 ’s charmless contribution was to offer a betting market on fans burning their own club shirts live on @entity96			2
a @entity125 source said : ‘ this is not the sort of thing we want to see encouraged , ’ but a spokesman for the betting firm defended their actions : ‘ it was tongue in cheek and was n’t the most irresponsible thing done on deadline day			0
’ the @entity137 will break from tradition this month by scrapping the closing ceremony and instead holding the trophy presentation on the 18th green			1
this is to minimise the time between the match finishing and the cup being held aloft , especially with the light fading at that time of year			0
it also spares the crowd listening to too many speeches about how proud each captain is , and would have saved the likes of @entity151 putting his foot in it when he infuriated 2010 hosts @entity154 with his remarks in 2008 about cagoules being needed in @entity157 — which they were			0
breaking tradition : the @entity137 will scrap the closing ceremony this month the @entity125 have received plenty of valid criticism about their dysfunctional relationship with the @entity38 being at the heart of the national team ’s problems — especially when compared with world champions @entity32 , where the national association and the @entity170 are joined at the hip			1
the @entity125 ’s front - foot response is that @entity32 ’s national football federation has a majority of representatives on the board from @entity170 clubs			1
@entity178 : the @entity32 national association enjoy a tight - knit relationship with the @entity170 it 's not too late to play @entity182 … there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			0

@entity32 and @entity34 ’s football federations are understood to have already begun preparations for the 2018 @entity5 in @entity13
@entity65 has called for the @entity69 urn to be retained by the victors
@entity96 will find @entity97 only willing to talk to their cameras when contractually obliged to after a fall - out over @entity103 ’s compensation
the @entity137 will scrap the closing ceremony and instead hold the trophy presentation on the 18th green
