by @entity0 , @entity1 editor food watchdogs have been accused of a cover - up after it emerged six in ten supermarket chickens carry a dangerous bug			0
the contamination is driving a food poisoning epidemic that hits at least 280,000 people a year			1
official estimates suggest the bug , campylobacter – which causes stomach upsets , vomiting and diarrhoea – is responsible for more than 100 deaths each year			1
it costs the economy about £ 900million in treating the sick and lost days at work			1
the figures were published yesterday by the @entity32			1
but it refuses to name the stores involved , following lobbying from retailers and @entity36			0
consumer groups and academics say the @entity32 and the government are putting the commercial interests of big business ahead of public health			1
the figures demonstrate that retailers , producers and the @entity32 have failed to deliver on promises to clean up dirty chicken since the last major survey of campylobacter was published in 2009			1
then , the contamination level was 65 per cent of all fresh whole chicken , while the latest tests put the figure at 59 per cent			1
tests were carried out on 853 birds sold between february and april , with 16 per cent – around one in six – found to have the highest level of contamination			1
even the outside of one in 20 packs of raw chicken was contaminated with campylobacter , suggesting that simply picking up a bird to check a price creates a risk			1
official estimates suggest the bug , campylobacter - which causes stomach upsets , vomiting and diarrhoea - is responsible for more than 100 deaths each year until efforts to eradicate the bug are successful , families are being advised to handle chicken carefully and cook it thoroughly			1
@entity75 , executive director of which ? , called for an end to the secrecy			0
‘ the @entity32 ’s survey reveals unacceptably high levels of campylobacter and they must now publish the names of the retailers so consumers are aware of the best and worst performing shops , ’ he said			1
earlier this year , when it revealed plans for a series of surveys , the @entity32 announced that it would publish the names of the stores selling the contaminated chicken			1
it was hoped this would shame the retailers into action			0
however , this was overturned following lobbying from supermarkets and the @entity101 , the organisation which represents them			0
officials in the food and farming department @entity103 , which has close links to farmers and processors , also campaigned to keep the details secret			0
there are even suggestions that the prime minister ’s office wanted to block the release of names			0
the @entity32 decision to keep the names secret went through only on the casting vote of its chairman , @entity118 ( left ) , while @entity121 environment spokesman @entity120 ( right ) said the @entity32 must be transparent and put ' the interests of the consumer first ' the @entity32 decision to keep the names secret went through only on the casting vote of its chairman , @entity118 , a former president of the @entity125			2
@entity126 , professor of science policy at the @entity128 , said the secrecy surrounding the sale of contaminated chicken is ‘ deeply disappointing ’			1
he said : ‘ the @entity32 has failed to keep its promise to the @entity135 public			2
this means that consumers can no longer trust the @entity32 to put the interest of consumers ahead of those of the food industry			2
’ @entity141 , professor of food policy at @entity143 , said the @entity32 had been ‘ captured ’ by industry interests			2
‘ this is a sad day for @entity135 food policy			0
a quarter of a century after the @entity135 learned of the extent of contamination of poultry , we are back again with unacceptable levels of food - borne pathogens			0
then , it was salmonella			0
now , it ’s campylobacter			0
’ @entity121 ’s environment spokesman @entity120 said : ‘ the government must restore confidence in the food sector and ensure that the @entity32 is transparent and puts the interests of the consumer first			2
’ @entity32 chief executive @entity161 said it will publish a full survey with the names of stores , but not until it has more information			1
the @entity101 insisted much of the responsibility for tackling campylobacter should be passed to consumers , who can protect themselves by carefully handling and thoroughly cooking chicken			2
its food director , @entity171 , said : ‘ we ’re working really hard right across our supply chain but sadly there just is n’t a magic bullet that will get rid of campylobacter because it occurs naturally in poultry			0
’ recently , allegations of suspect practices were made about two of the @entity135 ’s biggest chicken suppliers , the @entity182 and @entity183 , which supply supermarkets and restaurant chains			0
industry insiders claimed , for example , that chicken which fell on to the floor at two 2 sisters factories was routinely put back on to the production line			0
the @entity32 investigated and declared the plants involved were operating within acceptable standards			2
a government spokesperson said : ‘ as long as the public continue to follow long standing advice on preparing and cooking chicken , campylobacter poses minimal risk to them			0
our top priority is the safety of the public and we want people to feel reassured the food they buy is safe			0
‘ previous figures have shown around two thirds of poultry to be carrying this bacteria and we continue to work closely with the @entity32 , retailers , processors and farmers to tackle campylobacter in poultry			1
