lucrative business : @entity7 , @entity4 's biggest out of hours care provider , is paying doctors £ 150 an hour for a nine - hour shift because managers are so desperate to cover evenings and weekends the shocking revelation comes a day after the @entity6 told how in one county , @entity7 was using just one advanced nurse practitioner to cover up to 250,000 patients overnight			1
but despite mounting concern about out - of - hours care , the health secretary insisted family doctors should still not be forced to work outside normal office hours			1
in a statement , @entity33 said @entity1 should not ‘ necessarily ’ be on call at evenings and weekends – as they were a decade ago – because ‘ they work hard , they have families and they need a life ’			2
under @entity43 ’s 2004 renegotiation of their contracts , gps were allowed to hand responsibility for out - of - hours care to private firms such as @entity7			1
but many gps refuse to work for @entity7 , which has contracts in @entity51 , the @entity52 , the @entity53 and the @entity54 , because they are unhappy about care standards			1
unless managers offer what are described as ‘ market rates ’ , rotas would not be filled			0
out of hours services : the shocking revelation comes a day after the @entity6 told how in one county , @entity7 was using just one advanced nurse practitioner to cover up to 250,000 patients overnight the documents seen by the @entity6 include an email from a senior manager working for @entity7 which reveals how doctors have been offered bonuses for referring a friend			2
the memo , sent last year , reads : ‘ i would remind you that there remains a £ 1,000 bonus fee for staff who successfully introduce a colleague to the service			1
’ as @entity7 and the other firms are paid by the @entity79 to provide out - of - hours care , this money effectively comes from the taxpayer			1
the documents also include desperate emails sent by managers to gps begging them to work shifts that start in just two hours			0
one , with the subject line ‘ @entity88 [ sic ] today ’ , was sent to doctors at 11.43am asking them to fill two shifts , one of which started at 2pm that day			0
@entity94 , of the @entity95 ’ @entity93 , said : ‘ this is an astonishing amount of money to pay for just one shift			0
‘ not only does this place a huge burden on the @entity79 and taxpayers , excessive pay could encourage staff to work though the night regardless of their circumstances			0
’ there is concern that out - of - hours care is so poor that an extra four million patients are flooding @entity111 units each year because they have nowhere else to go			1
yesterday the @entity6 published a series of allegations from a whistleblower , a gp who has worked for @entity7 in @entity117 , which included claims that terminally ill cancer sufferers were being made to wait eight hours for pain relief			0
he also revealed how the firm was using advanced nurse practitioners to cover districts of up to 150 square miles when @entity1 could not be found			2
referring to doctors ’ hourly pay rates , a spokesman for @entity7 said : ‘ we pay market rates which are appropriate for the day and time of shift being offered			0
’ mr @entity33 , who is overseeing a review of how the system must be improved , said yesterday : ‘ it was a historic mistake to remove responsibility for those services from gps as part of a contract renegotiation in 2004			0
‘ not because family doctors should necessarily go back to being on - call in evenings and weekends ; they work hard , they have families and they need a life too			0
‘ but when responsibility for those services moved outside the gp practice , the personal accountability for 24/7 access to general practice was destroyed			0

@entity1 are *reluctant* to work for out - of - hours care provider @entity151 because they are unhappy about standards
the firm even offers a £ 1,000 bonus to any doctor on their books who successfully refers a friend to work for the service
