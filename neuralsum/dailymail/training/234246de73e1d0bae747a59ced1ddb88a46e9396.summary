@entity0 , addressing the @entity9 's conference in @entity10 today , launched a furious assault on officers ' behaviour and accused them of holding the public in ' contempt ' @entity0 's bombshell attack came as a it emerged another police officer has been sacked following the investigation into the @entity27 ' plebgate ' row			1
@entity38 , a serving pc with the diplomatic protection group - which mans the gates in @entity27 - was dismissed today for gross misconduct			1
the ' plebgate ' row erupted after cabinet minister @entity28 launched into a foul - mouthed outburst when he was denied permission to cycle through the main gate at @entity27 on september 19 , 2012			1
mr @entity28 and the gate officer at the time pc @entity50 gave conflicting accounts of what happened			0
the officer claiming mr @entity28 used the word ' pleb ' , something mr @entity28 has always denied			1
@entity57 said a person ' closely connected ' to @entity59 , who was not on duty at the time of the incident in @entity27 , contacted @entity64 newspaper the day after the incident			1
another officer , pc @entity66 , was sacked at the end of april over leaks to the press linked to the row			1
she was on duty in @entity27 on the day of the confrontation			1
four officers have now been sacked over the scandal			0
@entity57 today confirmed one further gross misconduct case remained			0
mrs may warned the @entity9 , which represents ordinary police officers , that it was time for them to ' face up to reality ' and change their ways			1
the sustained assault left one officer complaining that he had never had ' such an attack and a personal kicking ' in his 21 years in the police			2
mrs may said she was determined to change the way officers behave and announced that she was willing to grant the police watchdog , the @entity87 , more powers to investigate corrupt @entity91 she said : ' it can not be right when officers under investigation by the @entity87 comply with the rules by turning up for interview but then refuse to cooperate and decline to answer questions			0
' the minister said this behaviour ' is often encouraged by the @entity9 '			1
she said this revealed an attitude ' far removed from the principles of public service felt by the majority of police officers '			2
mrs may added : ' it is the same attitude exposed by @entity107 when officers , called to help a woman who had suffered domestic violence , accidentally recorded themselves calling the victim a “ slag ” and a “ bitch ”			0
' it is the same attitude expressed when young black men ask the police why they are being stopped and searched and are told it is “ just routine ” even though according to the law , officers need “ reasonable grounds for suspicion ”			0
' it is an attitude that betrays contempt for the public these officers are supposed to serve – and every police officer in the land , every single police leader , and everybody in the @entity9 should confront it and expunge it from the ranks			1
' she said ' it is not enough to mouth platitudes about a few bad apples ' in the face of a slew of high profile scandals that have hit the police			2
mrs may said a third of the public do not trust officers to tell the truth			2
during questions and answers , one @entity9 representative , who said he had served as an officer for 21 years , told the home secretary : ' i 've never had such an attack and a personal kicking from what you said there			1
' he added : ' we all accept we need to change			0
we want to do that			0
we do not need to be politicised			0
' ' you 're threatening to bully us , ' he said			0
earlier , delegates heard from outgoing chairman of the @entity9 @entity160 , who said the organisation was ' more than stories about plebgate '			1
the chairman , whose successor is expected to be chosen on friday , told the home secretary said that members are ' deeply concerned ' that officer numbers are falling across the country in the face of 20 per cent budget cuts , and claimed that staff levels were falling close to those in the 1980s			2
despite previous claims that he had been bullied out of his role , he received a long round of applause at the end of his final annual address			0
the government has already reduced the @entity9 's funding from £ 320,000 to £ 190,000 a year			1
but in a speech to around 2,000 officers mrs may said : ' i can announce today that this funding will be stopped altogether from august			0
' the @entity9 came under fire earlier this year for having tens of millions of pounds stashed in unregulated accounts			2
there were murmurs through the audience after mrs may told members : ' it is not acceptable that when the @entity9 is sitting on vast reserves worth tens of millions of pounds , it is in receipt of public funds to pay for salaries and expenses of the chairman , general secretary and treasurer			1
' we have already said we would reduce this spending from £ 320,000 to £ 190,000 per year but i can announce today that this funding will be stopped altogether from august			0
' instead , the money will go into a new fund to accelerate the introduction of @entity208 - a new scheme designed to attract the brightest young university graduates into the police			0
' the home secretary also announced that officers will no longer automatically become members of the federation , and instead will have to opt in			0
earlier , the home secretary told police officers who question the need for change to ' face up to reality '			1
@entity7 mp @entity28 was accused of calling @entity27 police officers ' plebs ' but angrily denied the accusation			1
he claims the police conspired to bring him down in a bid to damage the government mrs may listed a string of damning controversies faced by forces across the country including the findings of the @entity234 and the so - called plebgate row			1
she said : ' if there 's anybody in this hall who doubts that our model of policing is at risk , if there is anybody who underestimates the damage recent events and revelations have done to the relationship between the public and the police , if anybody here questions the need for the police to change , i am here to tell you that it 's time to face up to reality			1
' in a forceful speech , mrs may told members if the @entity9 does not change and accept reforms recommended by sir @entity263 , it will be forced to do so			2
she said that she will change the law to allow the @entity266 access to the @entity9 's so - called ' number two ' accounts , many of which are currently inaccessible even to the @entity9 's national leadership			1
mrs may said : ' i do not want to have to impose change on you , because i want you to show the public that you want to change			0
' i want you to show them that you have the best interests of the police and of the public at heart			2
' but mrs may added that she would overhaul the police with or without their support			0
she said : ' make no mistake , if you do not make significant progress towards the implementation of the @entity284 reforms , if the @entity9 does not start to turn itself around , you must not be under the impression that the government will let things remain as they are			2
' @entity289 was created by an @entity290 and it can be reformed by an @entity290			0
if you do not change of your own accord , we will impose change on you			0
' mrs may was greeted with silence from audience members as she finished her speech , and no round of applause			0
the @entity9 , representing 126,000 rank and file officers in @entity301 and @entity302 , has come under sustained attack after being caught up in a series of scandals			2
an independent review earlier this year said it had lost the trust of ordinary police officers following its high profile and controversial campaign against @entity287 cuts			2
the @entity9 had tried to use the 2012 @entity312 row - in which the former chief whip @entity28 was accused of swearing at police officers - to attack the government			1
but it then emerged that a witness to the row was a metropolitan police officer who had lied about what he had seen			1
the officer , pc @entity318 , was jailed for a year in february			0
another two officers have been sacked for misconduct over the scandal			0
the subsequent review into the organisation found it needed change from ' top to bottom ' and revealed the existence of secret accounts worth millions of pounds and lavish expenses claims			0
chairman @entity160 then announced he was standing down after being called a dictator and a traitor for trying to reform federation			0
the scandals surrounding the @entity9 came as the police as a whole faced growing public anger over cover - ups , corruption and racism allegations			1
it emerged last year that officers had tried to smear the family of murdered teenager @entity343			0
a review into the murder also revealed shocking evidence of corruption during the original investigation			0
officers have also been attacked for their role in the @entity351 cover up scandal and for allegedly rigging recorded crime statistics to make their performance look better than it actually is .			2
