the @entity1 third round will be the first set of fixtures of 2016 - avoiding the congestion which disrupted this year ’s competition			2
a full @entity7 programme on @entity8 meant that last weekend ’s third round was played over five days			0
some top - flight teams played twice in 48 hours , while @entity11 versus @entity12 did not take place until tuesday night			1
@entity11 's @entity14 scores to make it 1 - 1 against @entity12 in their match on tuesday @entity17 played @entity7 matches on december 28 and @entity8 , recording a win and a draw , and then beat @entity21 in the @entity1 on january 3 but @entity22 can confirm that there will be no @entity8 league matches next season and that the majority of @entity1 third - round ties will be played on saturday , january 2			1
the @entity7 are keen to avoid a repeat of the congestion which plagued this year ’s festive period and that is one of the reasons why next season ’s league fixtures will kick off on saturday , august 8 , a week earlier than normal			2
this is also because of @entity35 - starting on june 10 - and the @entity37 final , may 28 , which mean the @entity7 campaign must finish earlier than last year			0
@entity39 congratulate midfielder @entity40 ( third right ) after he scored in their 7 - 0 win over @entity43 on january 3 following their 1 - 1 draw with @entity12 on @entity8			0

most @entity1 third - round matches will be played on january 2 in 2016
some top - flight teams played twice in 48 hours over the @entity49
