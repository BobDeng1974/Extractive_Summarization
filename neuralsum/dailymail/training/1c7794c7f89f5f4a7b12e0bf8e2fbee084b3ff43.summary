by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:14 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 04:42 est , 22 may 2013 in a speech today @entity2 will say @entity5 infighting over @entity6 and gay marriage has been an ' unwelcome distraction ' which is undermining public support for the government @entity2 today warned the warring @entity5 to ‘ get back to governing ’ – as he insisted the @entity11 will continue until the bitter end in 2015			1
in a combative speech that will infuriate conservative mps , the deputy prime minister said @entity5 infighting over @entity6 and gay marriage has been an ‘ unwelcome distraction ’ which is undermining public support for the government			1
mr @entity2 warned that key @entity20 announcements on issues such as pensions and long - term care for the elderly , have been obscured by internal ‘ political punch ups ’ in the @entity5			1
@entity5 mps are being ‘ consumed by game - playing over @entity6 and gay marriage – mps disappearing into a parliamentary rabbit warren , obsessing over this new tactic or that new trick : paving legislation , enabling referendums , wrecking amendments ’ , ' he added			1
‘ anyone watching would be forgiven for asking : what are these politicians doing ? so it ’s time to get back to governing – providing the leadership and focus the people of @entity42 deserve in these difficult times			0
’ mr @entity44 hinted at the weekend that he could dissolve the @entity11 and try to continue as a minority government if relations with the @entity47 paralyse his administration			2
the prime minister told @entity50 that despite some ‘ frustrations ’ , the coalition remained the best way to get things done			1
‘ but if that was n't the case then we 'd have to face the new circumstances in whatever way we should , ' he added			0
in a speech today mr @entity2 criticised what he called the ‘ rather creative coverage ’ of those comments			2
‘ he echoed exactly what both of us have always believed : this @entity11 has been remarkably radical ; it still has work to do ; and the best way for us to serve and improve @entity42 is by finishing what we started , ’ he said			0
‘ i am absolutely committed to this coalition lasting until 2015 - as is the prime minister			1
’ claims that it was in either or both parties ' interests to ‘ prematurely pull the plug ’ were wrong			0
voters ‘ will not forgive either party if we call time ahead of the election that has been legislated for in 2015 - destabilising the nation in the vague hope of short - term political gain ’			2
nor would it work for the @entity47 to try to ‘ pull the wool over people 's eyes ’ and win back critics of the coalition deal by quitting six months early			0
‘ and , frankly , that is n't what we want			0
the @entity47 look forward to fighting the next election as a party of government , on our record in government , and with a distinct vision of our own for the next government - having seen this one through until the end			1
an early election would mean ‘ destabilising the nation in the vague hope of short - term political gain ’			0
however the decision to focus on @entity5 woes comes after mr @entity44 has been rocked by rebellions over gay marriage and @entity6 in recent days			2
relations with traditionalists worsened at the weekend after reports that the party 's co-chairman @entity108 said @entity27 were rebelling because of pressure from ' swivel - eyed loons ' in @entity5 associations			1
lord @entity108 denies the claims relations with traditionalists worsened at the weekend after reports that the party ’s co-chairman @entity108 , a close friend of the prime minister , said mps were rebelling because of pressure from ‘ swivel - eyed loons ’ in @entity5 associations			1
lord @entity108 denies the claims , but mr @entity44 offered an olive branch to party members on monday when he emailed them to say he had a ‘ deep and lasting friendship ’ with the grassroots			2
he said he would never employ anyone who ‘ sneered ’ at ordinary members			0
but his message was dismissed as ‘ too little , too late ’ by some activists yesterday			0
@entity128 , constituency chairman in education secretary @entity131 ’s @entity130 seat , said : ‘ unfortunately , a lot of people feel we have been treated with a degree of disdain and contempt			2
’ and last night , former @entity5 chairman @entity138 warned that the party was heading ‘ straight for disaster ’ unless it stopped tearing itself apart			1
‘ if you are divided and you look pretty unpleasant as well then you are not going to win an election , ’ he said			0
the interventions come as @entity44 faces more criticism from grassroots activists over his handling of @entity6 and gay marriage , and allegations that a key ally described party members as ‘ mad , swivel - eyed loons ’ .			0
