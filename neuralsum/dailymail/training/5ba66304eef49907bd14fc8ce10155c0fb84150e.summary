' you used a classic fascist reply of : " you are here taking our jobs and taking our money "			0
' how rich to hear something like that from someone like you			0
‘ this is a society based on tolerance , and that ’s what is its strength			0
you have made no contribution to society , you regularly take from it , are still abusing drugs and assaulting our citizens			0
