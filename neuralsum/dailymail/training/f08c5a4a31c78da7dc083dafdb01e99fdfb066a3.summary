by @entity0 published : 10:26 est , 5 april 2013 updated : 14:40 est , 5 april 2013 high street giant @entity1 does n't like sticking to the rules			0
the store was among the first in @entity5 to introduce plus size mannequins , ban airbrushing from campaign images and use disabled models in their photoshoots			1
and today they took their campaign against body image tyranny one step further by becoming the first high street retailer in the @entity5 to promote its fashion collections with a campaign so rich in diversity			1
the campaign turns its back on the industry norm of young , thin models , instead featuring an amputee , three models over 40 - including one nearing 70 - and a @entity22 athlete			1
non-conventional : debenhams are famous for their groundbreaking campaigns and this is their best yet fashionable diversity : @entity1 has unveiled its amazing new diversity campaign featuring the likes of paralympian amputee @entity36 there is a petite model just over five foot tall , and swimwear shots celebrating curves using a model who is a size 18			1
then there is @entity45 , who hopes to become the first black plus size supermodel , and @entity48 , who is the face of @entity50			2
for the @entity52 look book @entity1 worked with inclusivity campaigner and fashion industry commentator @entity54			1
the aim is to further challenge perceived norms of the fashion industry showing that a broader range of body and beauty ideals is a good thing			1
' our customers are not the same shape or size so our latest look book celebrates this diversity			2
@entity1 ' swimwear shots celebrate curves thanks to their size 18 bikini model ' we would be delighted if others followed our lead			2
hopefully these shots will be a step , albeit a small one , towards more people feeling more comfortable about their bodies , ' said @entity80 , director of pr at @entity1			0
' to showcase the range of sizes and labels at @entity1 this season we chose models to inspire us with their own unique looks and personalities			2
' i loved seeing the way that clothes emboldened each woman and man and i loved being on a shoot where no two models were the same , ' said @entity54			1
no age limit : the campaign features 69 - year - old @entity97 , whose modelling career began in the @entity99 embracing all shapes and sizes : the look book features alternative model , @entity104 , who was born without her left forearm and discovered when she won tv show ' missing @entity108 ' @entity110 range : the aim is to further challenge perceived norms of the fashion industry showing that a broader range of body and beauty ideals is a good thing ' as a commentator on the importance of seeing a broader range of body and beauty ideals in our media , i never underestimate the power of great clothes to bolster self - esteem , or the impact of imagery that celebrates difference , ' she added			1
minister for women and equalities @entity134 said : ' once again @entity1 is showing that beauty comes in all forms – different skin colours , ages , body shapes and sizes			0
' it was one of the first to introduce size 16 mannequins , and continues to send a clear message to the rest of the retail industry that many customers want to see more diverse and realistic images			2
diverse : @entity151 , who 's just 5ft tall features , as well as plus size model @entity48 , who at size 18 was the face of @entity50 ' i have long been concerned that idealised , unrealistic media images play a significant part in lowering self - esteem and reducing women ’s confidence and contribution – at school , at work , and in society			0
' the government works with a range of industries , including retail and fashion , to promote more honest and varied images of women			0
' the models in the look book are truly diverse , each with their own unique style and personality , and i hope they inspire others to feel good about their bodies			0
' personalities : the models in the look book are truly diverse , each with their own unique style and personality @entity1 scoured top model agencies in search of a group of professional models who go further to be representative of diversity , and to convey a message empowering every man and woman to feel able to wear the latest trends , but to make it right for them through style			0
