by @entity0 a @entity2 harpoon whaling ship has rammed a conservationist protestors ' vessel in dramatic scenes in icy seas off @entity7			1
video released by anti-whaling organisation , @entity9 , shows the @entity2 ship the @entity10 2 crashing into the bow of the @entity12 on sunday in the @entity13 off the @entity14			1
@entity9 claims the collision was deliberate and part of a sustained attack by three whaling ships on the protestors			2
known as " the last ocean " , the @entity35 teems with large predatory fish , whales , seals and penguins			0
the @entity9 vessels had sailed to the @entity35 to interfere with a @entity2 whaling fleet comprising the @entity10 , @entity10 2 , @entity10 3 and the world 's only whaling factory ship , the @entity56			2
@entity9 claims the @entity2 ships launched a sustained eight hour attack from around 1am @entity60 @entity59 ( @entity61 ) on sunday			1
@entity9 said its ships had positioned themselves off the @entity56 's slipway to block the harpoon vessels from loading the corpses of whales they had caught onto the factory ship			2
the @entity56 is chartered by @entity2 's @entity69 ( @entity69 ) , which claims to be a nonprofit research organization of whales and dolphins , but which @entity9 and @entity73 say is just a @entity2 government - funded operation for slaughtering whales for profit			1
@entity2 crewman aboard the @entity10 as it harpoons whales in the icy waters off the @entity14 conservationists risked their lives in the icy waters of the @entity35 , off the @entity14 to stop @entity2 crews whales in the earth 's last untouched ocean in sunday 's attack , which continued until 9am , the harpoon vessels overtook the @entity9 ships , crossing their bows and coming within three to five metres in numerous " dangerous manoeuvres " , @entity9 claimed			1
it said the @entity90 struck the @entity12 and quoted the ship 's captain , @entity9 , and @entity93 of the @entity30 saying the two ships on several occasions had to steer out of the harpoon whalers ' paths , narrowly avoiding potential collisions			2
' the whaling vessels also made consecutive attempts to foul the propellers of the @entity9 ships by dragging steel cable across the bow of the conservation ships , ' @entity9 said			0
@entity73 claims the @entity56 has twice rammed its vessel , the @entity106 , although the @entity69 contested @entity73 was to blame			0
@entity69 says on its website @entity73 and @entity9 engage in dangerous ' sabotage ' which endangers life at sea			0
' @entity9 group , one of several @entity73 offshoots , joined the interference against @entity2 's whale research and , imitating @entity73 methods such as illegal boarding and ramming of research vessels , started to use increasingly dangerous and violent sabotage methods which include entangling devices ( propeller foulers ) , throwing and shooting of chemical - containing projectiles , smoke bombs and incendiary devices , ' @entity69 said			1
@entity2 whalers drag a minke whale harpooned in the @entity13 off @entity7 last year a pilot whale is netted off the cove at @entity131 , @entity2 , where a pod of dolphins was slaughtered in october last year an @entity60 conservationist who witnessed @entity2 crewmen herd a pod of dolphins into a cove off @entity131 , @entity2 , heard the ' distressed cries ' of the dolphins as they died ' such dangerous actions by these groups are not peaceful protest but unforgivable acts akin to terrorism that threaten human life at sea			1
' over and over again we have strongly condemned the harassment and sabotage actions by these groups and demand again that they refrain from further spreading violence under pretext of protecting whales			0
' @entity9 's team of volunteers from around the world has photographed the @entity69 's harpooning of whales , and slaughter of dolphins in the @entity2 port of @entity131			1
@entity60 @entity163 told of the scene at @entity131 last year , when the @entity2 team herded a pod of striped dolphins into @entity168 and how she could hear ' the distress cries of the dying pod members '			0
' although the noise and confusion of the killing must have been terrifying for these dolphins , they did not swim to the other end of the @entity168 , as they so wanted to be with their pod members who were in fear and pain and were taking their last breaths , ' @entity163 said			0
' it was incredibly harrowing to witness			0
