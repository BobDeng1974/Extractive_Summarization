by @entity0 published : 02:53 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 07:59 est , 26 july 2012 best of both worlds : the two foot - long creature , known as @entity3 , was a ' transitional snake ' with a lizard 's head and snake 's body a prehistoric reptile , half snake and half lizard , which lived 70 million years ago , has been unveiled by scientists			1
the two foot - long creature , known as @entity3 , was a ‘ transitional snake ’ with a snake ’s body and a lizard ’s head			1
new analysis of its fossilized remains shows snakes evolved their modern skulls on land - reigniting a long running dispute over whether they are marine or terrestrial animals			1
it was discovered over a century ago embedded in rocks in mountainous @entity27 in the west of the @entity29 but palaeontologists took another look at long neglected remains to get new clues to how it looked and lived			2
dr @entity34 , of @entity35 in @entity36 , said : ‘ the snake would have been about two feet long - so it was fairly small			2
it was non-venomous - venomous snakes evolved after the dinosaurs went extinct			1
‘ but it ’s possible it constricted its prey like many primitive snakes do today			0
‘ @entity45 lived alongside a number of familiar dinosaurs - it would have slithered beneath the feet of animals like @entity51 and @entity52			1
‘ however it probably was n’t hunted by dinosaurs			0
it was a burrower and so it would have spent much of its time hidden			0
’ the researchers said the lizard - like head suggests early snakes were burrowers that had long bodies before evolving the highly flexible skull characteristic of modern snakes			1
dr @entity34 said : ‘ snakes are the most diverse group of lizards , but their origins and early evolution remain poorly understood owing to a lack of transitional forms			0
‘ several major issues remain outstanding , such as whether snakes originated in a marine or terrestrial environment and how their unique feeding mechanism evolved			2
’ @entity45 emerged from a period known geologically as the @entity77 and was among the first snakes discovered			0
but until now only an isolated vertebra has been described and it has been overlooked in discussions of snake evolution			0
the researchers , whose findings are published in @entity84 , looked at previously undescribed material from the ancient snake including two upper jaw bones known as the maxilla and the lower jawbone where the teeth formed , along with some additional vertebrae			0
dr @entity34 said : ‘ @entity45 occurs in a continental floodplain environment , consistent with a terrestrial rather than a marine origin ; furthermore , its small size and reduced neural spines indicate fossorial habits , suggesting that snakes evolved from burrowing lizards			2
‘ the skull is intermediate between that of lizards and snakes			0
’ something underfoot ? @entity45 lived alongside a number of familiar dinosaurs - it would have slithered beneath the feet of animals like @entity51 and @entity52 the researchers also provided insight into the evolution of snake feeding			1
considering its small size , hooked teeth and skull structure - unlike modern snakes , @entity45 lacks the ability to swallow large prey whole - they propose it fed on relatively large , soft - bodied prey			1
the upper jaw was firmly united with the skull , indicating a motionless snout			0
dr @entity34 said : ‘ @entity3 therefore represents a transitional snake , combining a snake - like body and a lizard - like head			1
’ evolution of a new method of locomotion , and adaptations that facilitate the ingestion of larger prey were probably a key evolutionary step that promoted the diversification of snakes , added the researchers .			0

find offers hints of how modern snakes evolved
two - foot long reptile had head of lizard and body of snake
would have lived at same time as @entity51
