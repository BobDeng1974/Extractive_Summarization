@entity14 , 70 , from @entity15 in @entity16 , was born color - blind , but his sight was transformed after he fell over and hurt his head			1
scientists were baffled and the music teacher , unsurprisingly , was delighted			2
he told @entity21 : ‘ as a 70 - year - old man i fall quite a lot , as a matter of fact , cause my legs are not strong			2
i 've been color - blind since i was born , and at age 70 i see colors of the rainbow now			1
‘ every march we take a trip to @entity33 , i ca n't wait to get there with my new color sense and watch the flowers ... and the bikinis			2
’ he added : ‘ the old - fashioned @entity39 slogan was “ the world is a carousel of color ”			0
i 'm seeing the world that way			0
’ color - blindness affects one in 12 men and one in 200 women , according to @entity51			0
it ’s normally caused by a genetic pigment defect in the eye , so falling should n’t be able to cure it			0
a doctor told @entity21 that he was unable to explain mr @entity14 ’ new - found colorful sight , but speculated that he may just be perceiving colors differently			1
