it should come as no surprise that @entity2 appears wise beyond his years			1
the 26 - year - old @entity4 scrum - half speaks with the air of a man twice his age after a year of ‘ emotional turmoil ’ following the tragically premature death of his 58 - year - old mother @entity10 , who passed away last january after a six - month battle with skin cancer			1
that @entity14 has come through as a calm and reflective man , and happens to be playing the best rugby of his life , is testament to him and the club			1
‘ last season was tough , ’ @entity14 said			1
‘ it was an emotionally draining year			2
she sacrificed so much for me , driving me all over the country from the age of 10 , to club games and to @entity26 camps			1
some of the locations were far from glamorous and i remember her standing watching in the pouring rain , all wrapped up			2
my family have always been incredibly supportive			0

‘ @entity51 was a brilliant distraction for me , ’ he said			0
‘ the coaches , the owner and every single member of staff were magnificent			0
they let me take as much time off as i wanted after @entity58 died but i did n’t want to take time off			0
i ’m a rugby player			0
it ’s what i do			0
‘ being around the guys , i could temporarily forget things out on the training pitch			0
the support i received will stay with me			0
it meant a lot to me at a time when i was feeling pretty low			0
‘ i ’ve come back feeling fresh and i ’m loving my rugby and being part of the rejuvenation of this club on and off the pitch			2
i ’m over the moon with how things are going for me			0

with huge investment , a move to @entity115 ’s @entity114 and an ambitious recruitment drive under way , @entity14 ’s outstanding form at no 9 is a reflection of the club ’s health			1
‘ the players that ( director of rugby ) @entity122 has brought in have gelled with the existing players and you ’re able to see that in the results , ’ @entity14 added			1
‘ we ’re not the finished product , we still have a way to go , but it ’s a very healthy place to play , train and be part of			0
i ’m playing the best rugby of my career			0
‘ i ’m bossing the matches more effectively without losing that dangerous edge with the ability to snap up tries here and there and utilise my finishing and my pace			0
that ’s something i love to bring to the game because it sets me apart from other no 9s			0
’ on saturday night at @entity142 , @entity14 goes head to head with @entity26 scrum - half @entity75 , the man he replaced in the @entity148 squad after @entity75 suffered a foot injury in the warm - up game against @entity151			1
@entity14 ’s solitary cap in the pool win over @entity154 seems a long time ago			1
@entity4 coach @entity122 has overseen a difficult period for the club following their move to @entity115 it is not inconceivable that his club form could see a return in time for this year ’s @entity148			1
a strong show against @entity75 in a must - win @entity163 game for both clubs would do his chances no harm , four days before @entity168 names his @entity170 squad			1
‘ playing for @entity26 is why you play rugby , ’ said @entity14 , who racked up his 150th game for @entity4 against @entity34 last saturday			1
‘ i ’ve already had the experience of being around the squad for a few years and being in autumn and @entity170 squads			0
i ’ve been capped and been to a @entity148 and that ’s where i want to be			1
there ’s no bigger stage			0
‘ i have n’t spoken to the @entity26 coaches			1
i ’m just trying to keep my head down here and carry on doing what i ’m doing			2
@entity14 ( left ) replaced @entity75 in the @entity148 squad following the @entity76 scrum half 's injury ‘ my all - round game is at a peak and i want to keep improving until my mid- 30s			1
i feel like i can offer something to @entity26 and i ’d love to be given the opportunity			2
it ’s about me maintaining my form and the club maintaining its form			2
‘ i always set my targets as high as possible while trying to stay realistic			0
but my ambition has to be to break into that @entity26 squad			2
i would love to be capped in the @entity148			2
@entity200 and foremost , i ’d love to be part of the @entity148 squad in the summer			2
that would give me a shot and then it would be down to me to take my opportunity			0
’ following the personal tragedy of last season , few would begrudge @entity14 a break .			1
