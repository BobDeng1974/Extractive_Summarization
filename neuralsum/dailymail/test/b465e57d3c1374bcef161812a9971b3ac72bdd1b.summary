@entity0 could n’t let the moment pass			1
@entity2 had just rattled off their 13th home win of the season and the @entity5 wanted to crank up the pressure			1
a comfortable victory over @entity8 , inspired by two goals from the excellent @entity10 and crowned by @entity12 ’s magnificent strike , had seen @entity2 leap above @entity14 in the table for the first time since november 23 , 2013			1
when you think on january 10 this year the gap between the two clubs was 10 points , the turnaround has been remarkable			2
but now , as they head into their latest local squabble , there is mounting confidence around @entity26 that @entity2 will not surrender their position			1
@entity0 has piled pressure on @entity14 ahead of their games against @entity31 and @entity2 @entity2 picked up all three points at the weekend by beating @entity8 3 - 1 at @entity26 @entity33 believes @entity14 's players may struggle to get to grips with being in fourth spot @entity2 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity37 6 ; @entity38 7 , @entity39 7 , @entity40 7 , @entity41 7 : @entity10 8.5 , @entity42 7 , @entity43 6.5 ( @entity44 77mins ) : @entity45 7.5 , @entity12 8 , @entity46 6.5 ( @entity47 70			1
6.5 ) subs not used : @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 scorers : @entity10 43 , 90 , @entity12 79 @entity8 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity55 7 : @entity56 5.5 ( @entity57 46 , 5 ) , @entity58 5.5 , @entity59 5.5 , @entity60 5 : @entity61 5 ( @entity62 61 , 5 ) , @entity63 6 , @entity64 6 , @entity65 5 ( @entity66 77 ) : @entity67 6.5 , @entity68 5 subs not used : given , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 booked : @entity64 scorer : @entity67 80 man of the match : @entity10 referee : @entity77 6 is it feasible for @entity14 to finish fourth ? they face @entity31 on monday evening and @entity33 believes dropping down two positions will creep into the psychology of @entity83 ’s squad			1
even if @entity14 win at @entity85 , how will they handle the furnace that awaits this sunday ? ‘ it plays a part in the spirit of the players — of our opponents but also our players , ’ said @entity33			1
‘ we have more confidence now and when ( if ) they lose a point against @entity31 , then it is also sitting in their minds			0
‘ i do n’t know the individual players of @entity14 so well , so i can not judge them			1
but we have a lot of confidence and we have n’t lost so many times at home			2
the next game is going to be the decisive game			0
’ @entity33 is aware recent history spells doom for @entity2			1
they have lost seven of the last nine @entity111 derbies , including each of the last four			0
remarkably , they have not beaten @entity14 at home since @entity12 scored that breath - taking bicycle kick in february 2011			1
city , few would dispute , have the better squad but , regardless of what happens in south @entity118 , will they be able to hold @entity2 ’s momentum ? can they match their spirit ? big games are bringing the best out of @entity33 ’s men and they are clearly relishing the opportunity that awaits			2
@entity2 have not beaten @entity14 at @entity26 since @entity12 's wonder goal in february 2011 @entity14 striker @entity127 scored in his side 's 1 - 0 win over @entity2 back in november @entity12 likes playing against @entity8 — this was his 13th career goal against them			1
@entity133 ( 12 ) are his second favourite opponents			0
@entity2 lead rivals @entity14 by one point ‘ it was another @entity2 , i believe , ’ said @entity33 , when asked how he reflected on the 1 - 0 defeat he suffered at the @entity137 in november			1
‘ we have developed the team			0
that was more in the start of the process and now we are in the end of the process			0
‘ so i think also the confidence of our players is very high at the moment but also our performances shows that so it ’s not the same @entity2			2
it ’s like the game against @entity152 and the game ( coming up ) against @entity154 — you have to win these kinds of matches			2
’ with @entity152 ’s defeat by @entity160 effectively ending the doubt over which sides will finish in the top four , it now becomes a question of what order @entity154 , @entity160 and the two @entity111 clubs will be after the final games have been played			0
@entity2 ’s run - in is laced with demanding assignments — aside from @entity14 , they must go to @entity170 on april 18 , face a trip to @entity172 the following week and host @entity160 on may 16 — but they have an aura once more			1
@entity2 defender @entity174 saw red during the @entity177 clash at the @entity137 @entity2 vs @entity14 - april 12 @entity154 vs @entity2 - april 18 @entity178 vs @entity2 - april 26 @entity2 vs @entity179 - may 2 @entity31 vs @entity2 - may 9 @entity2 vs @entity160 - may 17 @entity180 vs @entity2 - may 24 @entity31 vs @entity14 - april 6 @entity2 vs @entity14 - april 12 @entity14 vs @entity181 - april 19 @entity14 vs @entity8 - april 25 @entity182 vs @entity14 - may 3 @entity14 vs @entity183 - may 10 @entity184 vs @entity14 - may 17 @entity14 vs @entity185 - may 24 @entity8 , stymied by injury problems that @entity187 described as ‘ crippling ’ , simply could n’t cope once they went conceded in the 43rd minute and the manager , who was noticeably glum afterwards , can at least take solace from the fact @entity183 will not offer the same threat on tuesday			1
‘ we know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown , especially in the last few games , it ’s going to be a great game , ’ said @entity46 , who admitted he was ‘ disappointed ’ to not be selected for the last round of @entity195 games			0
‘ hopefully we will get the three points			0
of course it would be nice but we are just taking each game as it comes			0
’ there was never any hint they would slip up here , bossing the first half and then going through the gears after a slow period after the break to swat @entity8 aside			2
@entity214 , with his slick passing and industry , was terrific			0
@entity12 ’s 14th strike of the campaign , meanwhile , was sensational			0
‘ it 's about momentum , especially when you are going into this vital stage of the season , ’ @entity46 added			0
‘ @entity2 teams always come strong at this stage and we are showing in every game just how strong we can be – and even how we finish the game			2
we will enjoy this but it is all about next week			0
’ @entity46 ( left , pictured with @entity10 ) believes his side are building momentum ahead of the derby			0
