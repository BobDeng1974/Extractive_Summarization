by @entity0 published : 05:12 est , 20 august 2012 updated : 06:07 est , 20 august 2012 a nasal cancer patient has found a novel way of ensuring he does not misplace his prosthetic nose - by sticking it to the side of his fridge			1
@entity10 's nose was removed three years ago when it was found to contain cancerous cells			1
last month the 64 - year - old was fitted with a prosthetic nose - it is held on to his face using magnets			1
novel storage : the prosthetic nose has magnets that attach to magnetic studs implanted in mr @entity10 's face - this also means it easily sticks to the fridge in his kitchen mr @entity10 , from @entity27 , @entity26 said : ' my new nose has given me a new lease of life but i was so worried we would lose it			1
' but after repeatedly buying fridge magnets as souvenirs from his holidays , mr @entity10 came up with a brainwave and now sticks his prosthetic nose alongside the others on the side of the fridge freezer before he goes to bed			1
' i used to wear my nose to bed when i first got it , but one night it fell off and landed in one of my slippers , when i got up in the middle of the night , i stood on my own nose			2
i got the shock of my life			2
keeping it safe : @entity10 wearing his prosthetic nose which was fitted last month ' it was only when i noticed the fridge magnets in our kitchen that i thought i would test out whether my new nose would stick to the side too			1
' now if i ’m cooking dinner , sometimes i ’ll just stick my nose on the fridge next to the magnets because i do n’t know when my nose is running and i would n’t want anything going into the food			1
' or if i ’m at a party with my friends , i ’ll maybe stick it on the fridge just to lighten things up			2
i ca n’t wait for the next time we go on holiday and go through security because i ’ll have to take my nose off - i bet they wo n’t have seen that before			2
' mr @entity10 was diagnosed with nasal cancer in 2009 , after noticing growths on his face			1
he said : ' for a year i had two scabs at the entry of each nostril , which i assumed were cold sores			0
i just used to pick them off - i did n’t think it was anything serious			0
' the sores were swabbed and @entity10 was prescribed antibiotics but in february 2009 , he was transferred to @entity84 for a biopsy where he was diagnosed with cancer			1
mr @entity10 , who lives with his wife @entity87 , 62 , an accounts manager said : ' i felt like i was in a dream , you always know someone with cancer but you never think you ’ll be the one to get it			1
' it was such a blow - i had been made redundant the month before , so it was already a difficult time			2
' mr @entity10 , who has seven grandchildren , was told the operation would be the most effective treatment so he agreed to go for it - even though his face would never be the same			1
replacement : mr @entity10 waited more than three years for his new nose , and it was fitted last month result : ' i burst into tears when i saw it for the first time - it looked so real ' , said mr @entity10 he said : ' i was told it would leave me very disfigured but would be the best option to fight the disease			1
it was life or death - so i did n’t care about losing my nose			1
' i wanted to carry on living and see my grandchildren grow up , that ’s what was important to me			0
i must have sat in the car outside the house for 40 minutes thinking of ways to break the news to my wife			0
' she burst into tears - she was n’t expecting it			0
she phoned our family who came round , it was very emotional			0
they were all so positive and told me they were behind me			0
' mr @entity10 on his 60th birthday before surgery mr @entity10 underwent the operation to remove his nose and most of his upper lip on april 16 , 2009 , before receiving four weeks of radiotherapy in june			1
he said : ' it was all very quick - i was home the next day			0
i was looked after by a fantastic team of nurses who would come to change the dressing - i ca n’t praise them enough			0
' the dressing was removed every day until it healed - but i just could n’t force myself to look at it			0
' although mr @entity10 had the confidence to go out with friends and to the shops within two weeks of his operation , it took him six months to look at himself in a mirror			1
he said : ' i refused to look			0
i thought i looked so ugly the first time i did , my stomach dropped			0
the vain man in me would have likened me to @entity153 - my hero - but i just looked so different			0
' ' i went back for the prognosis , it was the first time i ’d seen the surgeon smile			0
he said it was good news and that i had the all clear			0
it was such a big relief , i just felt brilliant ' , he added			0
up until four weeks ago mr @entity10 wore a triangular - shaped plaster on his face in a bid to improve his appearance - but he added : ' teenagers would actually shout abuse across the street , they would be laughing and pointing at me			1
' adults would avoid me - when they saw me they ’d hurry their kids across the road			0
some people thought i ’d been in a terrible fight and had brought it on myself			0
i felt ignored and was sick of people patronising me			0
' but it did n’t stop me going out , my amazing wife helped me and told me i was better than them - i would n’t let them stop me getting on with his life			2
' family support : @entity10 and @entity183 on their wedding day , 1971			1
he said his ' amazing wife ' helped him dealing with his treatment surgeons operated to improve the appearance of @entity10 ’s top lip last september and he was finally fitted with a silicon nose produced by @entity193 @entity192 last month			1
technicians at the firm spent months designing and producing the prosthetic nose , which was a rare task for them , as they were used to creating eyes , nipples and ears			1
' they looked at photos to create an exact replica of my nose and matched my skin colour perfectly			2
it is so life - like , the detail is incredible - there are even varicose veins			2
' mr @entity10 had waited more than three years for his new nose , which is held on with magnets			1
' i burst into tears when i saw it for the first time - it looked so real ' , he said			0
within the last months , his self - confidence has shot up and he is delighted			0
' when i walked out of the hospital with my new nose , not one person looked at me			2
although i ’ll never look the same , i am so pleased i can get on with my life ' , he said .			2

@entity10 , 64 , had the prosthetic nose fitted last month after nasal cancer treatment
