she has endorsed everything from scented candles to crockery and fashion in various failed bids to impress @entity7 shoppers			1
now the @entity8 is once again attempting to become a commercial success in the @entity7 – this time with an extraordinary film plugging a range of products including the bizarrely named ‘ @entity14 food emulsifier ’			1
called @entity15 , the 28 - minute ‘ infomercial ’ is scheduled to air on @entity7 television early this year			1
a voiceover explains that the @entity8 is ‘ one of the most recognised personalities on the planet ’ before going on to say her ‘ personal struggles and adversity have empowered her to be her best and help others improve their lives ’			1
things are certainly going better for the 55 - year - old @entity8 , who has lost almost 4st and has reportedly restored her relationship with the @entity42			1
now she has teamed up with mail - order specialist @entity43 , which has previously marketed products with @entity47 ’s ex-wife @entity46 and the late comedienne @entity48			2
as well as her involvement in the commercial campaign , the @entity8 has also registered five trademarks , including ‘ @entity52 ’			1
currently , the @entity14 is the only product available to buy in the @entity7 on duchessdiscoveries.com , billed as ‘ the official site of @entity8 ’			1
described as a ‘ powerful micro-emulsification system ’ , the seven - piece machine costing $ 99.99 ( £ 65 ) also comes with the @entity8 ’s meal plan			1
manufacturers claim the processor breaks down food into a ‘ micro-cellular pre-digestive state ’ and ‘ captures all of the essential vitamins , minerals , anti-oxidants and phyto - nutrients ’ to ensure the healthiest smoothies			1
on camera , the @entity8 claims the food processor accelerates weight loss , boosts energy and strengthens the immune system			0
it is understood she has been using the juicer for 14 months to aid her weight loss			0
however , @entity76 , a leading @entity77 dietician and obesity specialist , told @entity26 : ‘ any blender can break down food			2
this one uses several jargon terms to make it sound superior when it probably is n’t			0
‘ breaking food down to a pre-digestive state is the job of your stomach and it does it well			2
you do n’t need anything to help it do its job			0
‘ and no juicer or blender can enhance how much nutrition your body will actually absorb			0
having juices or blended foods can actually make weight loss more difficult as the food does n’t stay in your stomach long enough to make you feel full or satisfied after a meal			0
‘ i ’d advise people to be careful who they put their trust into			0
just because you use a celebrity or a self - endorsed “ expert ” does not mean you are qualified to provide advice on nutrition or weight loss			2
’ @entity111 , from @entity112 , was in the audience when the programme was filmed last july			2
she said : ‘ @entity115 talked about losing 55lb , more through juicing than exercise			0
i got the impression she does n’t like exercise			0
’ after her divorce from prince @entity121 19 years ago , the @entity119 took on a string of endorsements in the @entity7 , including a deal with @entity125			1
however , in 2006 the company set up to capitalise on her image in the @entity7 collapsed with debts of more than £ 1 million			2
unperturbed , @entity8 has recently filed her trademarks , which could enable her to endorse products including heated hair brushes and a line of farm produce			1
friends say she will launch a range of up to 17 speciality teas in the next few weeks			0
a friend said : ‘ @entity8 would never endorse a product unless it worked for her			0
she ’s in a really good place at the moment			0
she keeps saying “ this is me time ” and “ this is my time to blossom ”			0
in @entity147 she will always be the @entity148			0
but in @entity149 or @entity22 she ’s still a @entity150 and the @entity7 love that			1
’ ... and does it explain her very desirable new life in @entity154 ? @entity115 of @entity22 is so confident that her new @entity7 ventures will be successful that friends say she is planning to move out of @entity157 , the @entity158 home she still shares prince @entity121 , 19 years after their divorce – although this has been officially denied			1
the @entity26 has learnt that @entity8 is renting an apartment from a friend in upmarket @entity165 in @entity154 , where @entity166 and @entity167 once lived – and where rents can reach up to £ 10,000 a week			0
however , a source said the @entity8 is paying a ‘ peppercorn amount ’			2
‘ she is using the @entity165 place as her @entity174 base , ’ said one friend			0
‘ she intends to spend much of this year splitting her time between @entity174 and the @entity7 while she launches her businesses and if things take off she may consider getting somewhere more permanent			1
’ upmarket : the @entity165 home the 55 - year - old is using as a @entity174 base			1
