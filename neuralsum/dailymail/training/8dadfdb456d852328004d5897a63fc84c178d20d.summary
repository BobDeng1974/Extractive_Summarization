by @entity1 reporter published : 08:24 est , 22 february 2013 updated : 09:14 est , 22 february 2013 the @entity2 has reversed its prediction for an end to recession this year and is now predicting the eurozone will not return to growth until 2014 , with a lack of bank lending and record joblessness to blame			2
the 17 - nation bloc 's economy , which generates nearly a fifth of global output , will shrink 0.3 per cent in 2013 , the @entity2 said , meaning the euro zone will remain in its second recession since 2009 for a year longer than originally foreseen			1
the @entity2 , the @entity20 executive , late last year forecast 0.1 per cent growth in the euro zone 's economy for 2012 , but now says tight lending conditions for companies and households , job cuts and frozen investment have delayed an expected recovery			1
@entity29 forecasts : @entity31 and monetary affairs commissioner @entity30 said several eurozone countries are likely to miss deficit cutting targets because of a weak economy the @entity2 sees the euro zone economy growing 1.4 per cent in 2014 , with a figure of -0.6 percent for 2012			2
' the improved financial market situation contrasts with the absence of credit growth and the weakness of the near - term outlook for economic activity , ' said @entity43 , the commission 's director - general for economic and monetary affairs			0
' the labour market ... is a serious concern , ' he said , in a preamble to the @entity2 's latest forecasts			0
the @entity52 's promise last year to do what it takes to defend its common currency has removed the risk of a break - up of the euro zone , and member countries ' borrowing costs have come down from unsustainable levels			0
but the damage from the 2008/2009 global financial crisis and the ensuing euro zone debt crisis has been greater than expected on the real economy , with global demand for euro zone exports one of the few saviours in terms of generating growth			0
joblessness in the euro zone is set to peak at 12.2 percent , or more than 19 million people , in 2013 , the @entity2 said , and both private and public consumption will not make any contribution to improving output , instead dragging on the economy			1
recession : the @entity80 bloc - the combined economies of 17 nations - is predicted to shrink 0.3 percent in 2013 the outlook raises the prospect of further interest rate cuts by the @entity52 to jump - start the economy by reducing the cost of lending for companies and families , although with banks reluctant to lend , any impact may be muted			1
consumer inflation is forecast by the @entity2 to be 1.8 percent for 2013 , and with such pressures contained the @entity52 may feel more comfortable cutting rates to below the current 0.75 percent level			2
' a cut in the main refinancing rate is not the most powerful measure the @entity52 could implement , but it is a step in the right direction , " investment bank @entity97 wrote in a note this week			1
the @entity2 's overall view is a touch more pessimistic than that of the @entity107 , which sees a 0.2 percent euro zone contraction this year			0
the @entity52 previously cut its estimate of euro zone gross domestic product ( gdp ) for next year to between a fall of 0.9 percent and growth of just 0.3 percent			1
' a weaker - than - expected final quarter of 2012 is set to shift the inception of the recovery towards mid- 2013 , " the @entity2 said .			0
