@entity1 talisman @entity0 has emerged as the star player at the @entity3 in @entity4 and there is sure to be significant interest from @entity8 ’s leading clubs this summer			1
however , with @entity11 clubs facing stiff competition from @entity13 for his signature , there may be pangs of regret at @entity18 after it emerged that @entity19 have twice turned down the chance to sign the brilliant @entity22 playmaker			1
@entity19 have had an extensive scouting system in place in @entity25 and @entity0 was firmly on the club ’s radar as an 18 - year - old in 2010 when he was starring for @entity30 side @entity29			2
to rub salt into the wounds , @entity19 then bought the unknown £ 7.4m winger @entity46 just over a month later but he has started just three games in four years since signing for the club			1
flops : @entity19 signed @entity41 ( left ) and @entity46 ( right ) when they could have bought @entity0 for £ 5m @entity0 , meanwhile , went on to sign for @entity50 for a fee in the region of £ 4m , where he won three league title and the @entity55 under the management of @entity57 as his development continued apace			1
@entity19 ’s interest was then reignited in 2013 but they were put off by an asking price that approached £ 40m , while there were also complications with third - party ownership that made any deal incredibly difficult to pull off			0
golden boys : @entity0 and @entity67 have been two of the standout performers at the @entity3 @entity69 : the @entity1 attacker has scored five goals so far and leads the race to be top scorer @entity76 club @entity74 made the big money move for @entity0 , who joined the @entity76 club in a joint £ 60m deal for him and @entity50 team - mate @entity81 last summer			1
now , with @entity19 boasting a number of players who operate most effectively in the ‘ number 10 ’ position , including @entity86 , @entity87 and in the long term , @entity89 , it would seem very unlikely that @entity0 will one day surface as a @entity19 player			0
however , @entity74 are braced for for a battle to keep hold of the @entity22 this summer , with @entity95 and @entity13 registering an interest in the 22 - year - old			0
a league apart : @entity0 holds the @entity100 league trophy with @entity81 during their @entity50 days current club : the @entity22 plays for @entity74 in @entity103 but has been linked with a move to @entity105 although the @entity76 side will play in the @entity109 next season , it may not be enough to persuade @entity0 to stay , with his heart seemingly set on a move to @entity105			2
‘ it would be a dream to play in @entity105 , one of the best leagues in the world , ’ he is reported to have told @entity105 radio station @entity113			0
when pressed whether he would prefer @entity118 , @entity119 or @entity13 , he replied : ‘ i like @entity13 more			0
’ world class : @entity0 scored the goal of the tournament so far in the first half against @entity124			0

@entity1 's @entity126 has lit up the @entity3 with some superb *displays*
@entity19 have turned down the chance to sign @entity0 twice
first they bought @entity41 then they *shelled* out £ *7.4million* on @entity46
@entity0 is *angling* for a move to @entity105 with @entity13 his first *choice*
