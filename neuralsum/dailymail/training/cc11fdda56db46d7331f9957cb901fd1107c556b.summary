it 's less than a week since prince @entity1 was last in @entity2 and just under three months since prince @entity3 last visited the @entity4			1
now @entity5 has announced that the @entity3 is to set out on a whirlwind solo tour of the region early next month , with the @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 on the itinerary			1
however , the trip could prove controversial thanks to the presence of @entity15 and @entity2 on the schedule			2
new tour : @entity1 , pictured here arriving in @entity18 last week , is to tour the @entity4 next month regular visitor : prince @entity1 arrives in @entity18 for the funeral of @entity21 last weekend last week , as prince @entity1 flew to the @entity4 for the funeral of @entity21 , protests were sparked by the @entity25 's record on human rights			1
the dynasty has also been criticised for its strict interpretation of the qu'ran which sees women banned from driving and have very few rights			0
critics have also pointed to the @entity2 embrace of the death penalty ; highlighted by a harrowing video that emerged last week of a woman running from an executioner who then took two attempts to behead her			0
@entity15 , meanwhile , has been mired in controversy following allegations of corruption and bribery related to its successful 2022 @entity44 bid			0
the emirate has also been criticised for allegedly funding terrorist organisations , as well as hosting the headquarters of the @entity49 @entity48 in its capital @entity51			0
request : @entity1 , seen here with @entity54 in @entity18 , is travelling at the request of the government return : one country that @entity1 will return to is @entity9 , which he visited with @entity59 last year ( pictured ) culture : last year 's visit to @entity9 also included a visit to the ancient @entity64 ruins at @entity65 @entity1 ' tour , which is at the request of the government , comes less than a year after he last toured the region , on that occasion with the @entity71			1
during the 2014 tour , the couple had an almost identical itinerary with a single exception - @entity75 , which was on last year 's tour , has been swapped for the @entity8 and @entity10			2
a statement released by @entity5 said @entity1 ' early return to the region emphasises the ' importance ' that the government places on having close ties with the @entity4			2
' the @entity3 's return to the region , only one year after his last tour , demonstrates the importance @entity67 places on its association with key partners in the area , ' read the statement			0
entertaining : @entity1 and @entity59 also travelled to @entity75 ( @entity91 pictured ) but wo n't return this year controversial : @entity1 , pictured last year , will also visit @entity15 - a destination likely to prove controversial meeting : @entity59 with queen @entity93 ( left ) and teacher @entity94 at a @entity96 primary school ' these connections are underpinned by the long - standing and respectful relationships which exist between the @entity99 and the ruling families in the @entity101			1
' @entity1 will certainly have time to meet many of those , with each of his stops set to be hosted by the local royal dynasties			0
among them are @entity107 , whose capital @entity109 is the first stop , @entity111 , emir of @entity10 , and @entity15 ruler , @entity116 bin @entity114			0
