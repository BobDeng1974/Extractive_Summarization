during it 's seven - year run , critics praised @entity2 as a show on the cutting edge of comedy			1
now it appears the @entity8 - winning show was also ahead of its time when it came to the news - airing a dark joke painting @entity12 as a rapist all the way back in 2009			2
in a clip from season three ' the bubble ' , recently unearthed by @entity19 , @entity17 's @entity16 executive character @entity15 tries to get actor @entity22 ( played by @entity23 ) to come back to work at fictional television show @entity2 in the middle of contract negotiations by hiring a @entity12 impersonator to speak to the actor over the phone			1
but the plan backfires when @entity22 hears @entity12 's voice , and reveals he has some bad family history with the @entity34 star			1
the joke involved hiring a @entity12 impersonator ( right ) to coax an actor back to work under fire : the comedian used to be known as a moral pillar , an image he crafted through is many years playing an upright dad on @entity34			1
that 's changed now that at least 20 women have come forward to accuse him of rape ' @entity12 , you got a lotta nerve gettin ’ on the phone wit ’ me after what you did to my @entity55 ! ' @entity22 yells down the line			1
' i think you ’re confusing me with someone else , ' the baffled impersonator replies			0
she was a cocktail waitress with the droopy eye ! ' @entity22 responds			0
the impersonator finds himself at a lack of words , saying : ' i ’m the guy … with the pudding … ' ' do n’t try to tell me what to do ! dr. @entity71 , wit ’ yo ’ light - a * * kids ! @entity15 ! why would you make me talk to this man ? ' @entity22 finishes			0
not a @entity12 fan : @entity17 's character 's plan to get @entity22 ( played by @entity23 , right ) back to work backfires when @entity22 reveals an aunt 's traumatizing run - in with @entity12 in 1971 @entity15 : i ’ve arranged for one of @entity22 ’s childhood idols to reach out to him			1
@entity22 : hello ? @entity15 : @entity22 , this is @entity15 , i have someone here who wants to speak with you			0
@entity87 ( impersonator ) : @entity22 , this is @entity12 … @entity90 : [ whispering ] really ? this is your strategy ? @entity15 : [ whispering and smiling ] i heard him do this at a party ! @entity87 : … i want you to come back to the @entity2 for the people who like the jokes and the things			2
@entity22 : @entity12 , you got a lotta nerve gettin ’ on the phone wit ’ me after what you did to my @entity55 ! @entity87 : i think you ’re confusing me with someone else			0
she was a cocktail waitress with the droopy eye ! @entity87 : i ’m the guy … with the pudding … @entity22 : do n’t try to tell me what to do ! dr. @entity71 , wit ’ yo ’ light - ass kids ! @entity15 ! why would you make me talk to this man ? in 2005 , it was a dark joke that most likely went over most viewers ' heads			0
but , it 's unlikely the joke was crafted randomly			0
while accusations against @entity12 go all the way back to 2004 , it was n't until this october when comedian @entity118 gave a highly - public rant about the comedian which caused scores of women to go public with their stories , ruining the image @entity12 forged as a morally upright dad on his television show			1
buress himself spent time as a writer on @entity2 , though he was n't working for the show until after ' @entity131 ' was written			0
however , the fact that @entity118 knew about the allegations , means it was likely known by others in the @entity2 writing room			2
show creator @entity136 is the only person given a writer 's credit for the episode , with @entity140 ( who went on to act on @entity141 and also rap under the name @entity140 ) and @entity143 ( @entity145 ' ex-wife ) serving as executive story producers			1
writer : @entity2 creator and star @entity136 is the only person credited with writing the episode			1
she grew up in @entity150 , @entity151 , not far from @entity152 where a school employee first called out @entity12 for touching her inappropriately in 2004			1
@entity136 pictured above attending an event in @entity155 on october 20 that @entity136 may have known about the allegations against @entity12 is also unsurprising , since she grew up in @entity150 , @entity151 near @entity152			1
it was at @entity152 in 2004 that rape allegations against @entity12 first became public , when a former university employee @entity159 accused the star of fondling her			2
the case was ultimately thrown out a little over a year later , since authorities said they did n't have enough evidence to charge @entity12			0
instead , @entity164 field a civil suit in march of that year , and found 13 other women willing to testify as witnesses showing @entity12 's pattern of disturbing behavior			2
the suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount in november 2006			0
@entity136 has not commented on the scandal			0
@entity140 ( who went on to act on @entity141 and is also a rapper by the name of @entity140 , left ) and @entity143 ( right ) also served as executive story producers on the script			0

joke involved character @entity22 alluding that @entity12 hurt his aunt in 1971
the show 's creator and star @entity136 holds the only writing credit for the episode
@entity136 grew up in @entity150 , @entity151 , not far from @entity152 where @entity12 's alleged *misconduct* was first exposed in 2004
scores of women have been coming forward with stories of rape at the hands of @entity12 in the last few weeks , after former @entity2 writer @entity118 went on a rant about the comedian during a stand - up set
