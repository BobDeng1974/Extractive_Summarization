police have let another home intruder walk free on the grounds he was drunk and high on drugs when he broke in to a disabled man 's house at 3.30am			1
@entity6 was woken by his dog barking and was horrified when he realised a stranger had forced his way into his conservatory			0
the 59 - year - old , who suffers from degenerative disc disease in his spine , chased the younger man out of his semi-detached house and called the police			1
anger : homeowner @entity6 , who is registered disabled , chased the intruder from his home at 3.30am alarmingly , the intruder returned minutes later and tried to get back in but was caught by the police who escorted him off the property in @entity25 , @entity26			1
mr @entity6 said when he called the police the next day he was shocked to learn they were taking no further action against the man because he was drunk and was on drugs at the time			1
it is the second similar case involving an intruder escaping prosecution on the basis that they were intoxicated at the time they entered a stranger 's house			2
mr @entity6 , a computer programme engineer , claims he was told by officers the man had mistaken the house for his own			2
earlier this week we told how police released another drunk intruder who had broken into the home of @entity48 , 53 but it is thought the suspect lives in a village nine miles away , although he is believed to have family living about a mile from mr @entity6 's home in @entity25			1
earlier this week , estate agent @entity48 , 53 , told of his fury after he trapped a suspected burglar inside his home near @entity57 , @entity58 , only for the police to later let the man go because he was drunk			1
on that occasion , @entity58 police had seemingly accepted the man 's explanation that he had drunkenly mistaken mr @entity48 ' house for his own			1
mr @entity6 , who was offered £ 10 compensation following the break in , said he fears there is a worrying trend of people getting away with minor offences on the basis they are drunk			1
he said : ' i think people are getting away with things just because they are have been drinking and taking drugs			0
this is a pattern we are seeing more of			0
' if someone was to swear at a police officer they would be arrested but it now seems to me that if you enter someone 's property , you get a lift home so long as you have been drinking			2
' mr @entity6 lives with his wife @entity87 , their 14 - month old son and a 15 - year - old foster child			1
he said his intruder , who was aged in his 20s , had damaged a wooden fence to climb into his back garden before using a dog flap to enter the property			2
mr @entity6 said : ' i came downstairs at about 3.30am when my dog started growling			0
i was about to go into the kitchen when i saw the man in my conservatory			2
' i went out there and started shouting at him and he ran off , so i chased him but could n't get very far as i 'm registered disabled and ca n't run well			2
' i phoned the police and woke up my wife and as i was talking on the phone he reappeared at the back door and tried to get in again , my wife was terrified			0
mr @entity6 , 59 , who was offered £ 10 compensation , said he was shocked to learn police were taking no further action against the man because he was drunk and was on drugs at the time ' i flew outside and he ran off again and straight into the police			1
' but when i spoke to them the next day i was appalled to find out he was n't going to be charged			0
' they said he was on ketamine and alcohol and that he thought my house was his own and did n't know what he was doing			0
they said it was n't worth charging him			0
' since the incident in february , mr @entity6 has been offered £ 10 in compensation from the intruder via the police as part of a ' community resolution ' scheme			1
mr @entity6 refused the gesture			0
a spokeswoman for @entity26 police said : ' we dealt with this incident as criminal damage as the level of crime met the criteria for community resolution			2
' the level of crime was not of that to be dealt with through the court			0
' mr @entity6 was offered £ 10 in compensation from the man through the police , and the compensation amount is determined on each individual case			1
' an inspector who has dealt with this matter spoke to mr @entity6 very recently and at length			0
' he explained to him why the decision was made for a community resolution to the crime and why it was not appropriate to charge the offender			0
' mr @entity6 was satisfied with the explanation and did not want to pursue any further complaint			0
