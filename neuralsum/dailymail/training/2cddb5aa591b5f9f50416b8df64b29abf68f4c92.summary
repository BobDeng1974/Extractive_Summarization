by @entity0 a unit of museum experts tasked with investigating unexplained phenomenon have been left baffled by a mysterious substance , dubbed ' space slime '			1
carrying out work which would leave even @entity10 's @entity9 and @entity11 stumped , the team at the @entity7 have been tasked with identifying a host of bizarre items discovered by the @entity15 public			2
among the finds examined by the museum 's @entity17 was a mysterious slime discovered in a peaceful nature reserve in @entity21			1
mysterious : the origins of the ' space slime ' , discovered at a nature reserve in @entity21 , is being investigated by experts at the @entity7 's @entity26 , established to probe unexplained objects secrets of the universe : the strange gloop , found at the @entity32 nature reserve , mysteriously appeared around the same time as a meteor crashed to earth in @entity35 , @entity36 the strange gloop , found at the @entity32 nature reserve , mysteriously appeared around the same time as a meteor crashed to earth in @entity35 , @entity36 , and an amateur photographer claimed he had captured a mysterious object whizzing through the sky above the park on camera			1
the object appeared to be a meteor , although this was not confirmed by astronomers			0
nature buffs claimed the slime was merely frogspawn , while others said it was ' star jelly ' , a strange substance said to appear when meteors fall to earth , which has continued to stump scientists			1
the @entity57 - based museum 's @entity55 for @entity58 ( @entity55 ) , which houses the @entity26 and @entity17 , was tasked with investigating the mysterious slime , with the aim of establishing whether it had fallen from space , or if its origins were rather more terrestrial			1
laboratory tests have so far failed to find just what it could be - and where it had come from			0
discovery : the @entity7 's @entity70 says the slime is still a genuine mystery discovery : the @entity7 's @entity55 for @entity58 is tasked with identifying unknown objects , such as this rock which a member of the public mistook for a dinosaur skull agent skull - y : the pelvis bones of sea birds , such as auks and puffins , were thought by their imaginative discoverers to be dragon skulls the tooth is out there : a deer skull was mistaken for that on an ice - age sabre tooth cat because of its long tusks scientists from the unit extracted @entity94 from the jelly and tried to match it against that of birds and frogs , without success			1
dna traces of worms and bacteria were found in the substance , but these were not thought to have been the source of the slime , and had more likely come from organisms which colonised the matter			2
@entity70 , from the @entity55 , has been working on the mysterious substance since it was sent tothe unit by the @entity111 , which runs the nature reserve where it was found in february			1
' the slime is still a genuine mystery , ' ms @entity70 told @entity117			0
' there are stories in folklore that link it with meteor sightings			0
some people think it might be unfertilised frog spawn , others think it is a fungus , or a slime mould or that it is plant related			0
' none of the tests we have done so far have told us anything conclusive , but the samples we got were not in the best condition and highly contaminated			0
' ms @entity70 is set to open up her very own x-files this friday at a museum talk where she will explain how she has been unravelling the mystery , as well as other examples of the @entity55 's most intriguing and puzzling cases			2
revealing : the secrets of the @entity55 will be revealed at a talk at the @entity7 this week mystery : the origins of the ' space slime ' might even have left @entity145 from cult television programme @entity10 stumped the doors at the @entity55 , located inside the museum 's @entity7 , are open daily so that people who find strange objects , including fossils , can get help with identifying them			1
however , some of the mysteries of finds brought to the @entity55 , which was opened in 2010 , by eagle - eyed members of the public have proved easier to solve			0
the haul has included stones they believe to be the remains of a dinosaur and ' meteorites ' that are in fact discarded aluminium foil			0
a skull believed to have belonged to an ice - age sabre tooth cat , its fur still intact , was instead found to be that of a @entity171 , thought to have been mistaken for the ancient predator because of its long tusks which could have been mistaken for the cat 's powerful incisors			2
other animal remains have been mistaken for something even more incredible , such as the pelvis bones of sea birds , such as auks and puffins , which were thought by their imaginative discoverers to be dragon skulls			1
in one case , which initially appeared to be one for agents @entity145 , an ' alien ' in a jar of liquid was brought in , only to be revealed as a science fiction toy			0
every year the museum received around around 10,000 inquiries from the public , who are encouraged to bring their finds to the @entity55 , which is funded by supported by professor @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 .			0
