@entity1 motorists caught speeding in @entity2 face being tracked down and fined , under controversial new @entity4 rules			1
at the moment , drivers caught by a speed camera while in their own car abroad can not be fined because @entity4 police forces do not have the power to trace people abroad			1
but the @entity11 is expected to back new measures giving foreign police forces the power to send fines to @entity1 addresses and pursue motorists through the @entity1 courts if they do not pay			1
motorists caught by speed cameras abroad face being tracked down and forced to pay a fine , under new @entity4 rules motorists can already be traced if they are were driving hire cars or caught by police officers on the side of the road			1
the new rules , which are expected to be easily passed by the @entity11 , will allow motorists to be fined for speeding , ignoring a red light , drink and drug driving and driving while using a mobile phone			2
if a driver commits an offence in another country , the police will be able to use their car 's registration number to track them down			0
they will be given the power to send out a letter in the driver 's own language , demanding payment and threatening court action if they do not pay the fine			0
@entity1 police will also be able to pursue foreign motorists driving in @entity1 for any traffic and speeding fines they have accumulated in the @entity1			1
if approved , the @entity55 will apply to member states from may â€“ but the @entity1 will have two years to enforce the new law			2
the move , which is backed by ministers , has been welcomed by road safety campaigners			0
@entity61 , from the organisation @entity63 , said : ' for a driver who puts lives at risk to escape prosecution because their vehicle is registered in another country is both insulting and incomprehensible for victims			0
illegal driving crosses borders , so enforcement must cross borders too			0
' @entity76 president @entity75 ( right ) criticised new rules allowing @entity1 motorists caught speeding on holiday in @entity80 , @entity81 to be traced the @entity82 added : ' it 's not right that foreign drivers have gone unpunished for speeding offences in the @entity1 , and we are pleased this is set to change			1
' but it must n't be easier for @entity1 drivers to be prosecuted abroad than for foreign drivers to be prosecuted in the @entity1			1
we have made this clear from the outset of the negotiations			0
' @entity93 , a @entity94 mep and the @entity11 's negotiator on the issue , said the move would help cut road deaths by 50 per cent			0
he said : ' citizens are , of course , never thrilled to receive a letter telling them they have been caught committing a traffic offence , but they do welcome the fact that everyone in the @entity4 will be treated equally , no matter where their vehicle is registered			2
' but , @entity75 , the @entity76 president , said : ' in theory , tracking down drivers who break the law driving in other countries might sound like a good idea in terms of road safety but in practice it could be a nightmare			1
' different @entity2 countries have significantly different motoring laws and indeed penalties			0
if @entity1 drivers receive a penalty notice for using a " restricted lane " in @entity94 they may wish to contest it but this would prove impossible in most cases as often photographic evidence is not provided			2
returning to @entity2 for a court case is prohibitive in terms of cost			0

currently , drivers caught by speed cameras abroad can not be traced
but new measures give @entity4 police the power to send fines to @entity1 addresses
foreign police will also be able to pursue @entity1 motorists through the courts
the controversial *proposals* will apply to foreign motorists driving in @entity1
but the @entity76 said the move could be ' a nightmare ' for @entity1 motorists
