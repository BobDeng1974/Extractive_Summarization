on a mission : @entity1 , 21 , has reportedly vowed to bed 100,000 men across the globe a @entity5 woman has reportedly vowed to travel to every city across the world in a bizarre quest to sleep with 100,000 men			1
@entity1 from @entity9 embarked on the unusual mission in her home city last month and has so far added 284 notches to her bedpost , according to the @entity14			1
but while the 21 - year - old 's long term boyfriend is more forgiving than most - he has n't dumped her after all - he 's understandably ' not thrilled ' by the idea			0
miss @entity1 said that he has ' had to come to terms with it '			1
she told the @entity21 : ' i want men from @entity5 , @entity24 and @entity25			0
i love sex , fun and men			0
' in @entity5 the subject of sex is still taboo and anyone who wants to fulfill their sexual fantasies is considered a deviant , a w * * * * or mentally ill. ' miss @entity1 says that she will only look to complete the task at the weekends and has set up a @entity37 page and a website to chart her exploits - pages that her less than enamoured boyfriend might not want to save to his favourites			1
she adds that she hopes to spend at least 20 minutes with each partner			0
but the details of her apparently ambitious aim have cast doubt on its legitimacy , with several reports suggesting that it might be a hoax			0
according to reports , having sex with that many people for 20 minutes at a time would take miss @entity1 3.8 years to complete if she did n't stop for food or sleep			2
seeing as she only plans to partake on saturdays and sundays , the task would take 20 years non-stop			0
assuming she lives to the age of 81 , to hit 100,000 miss @entity1 would have to up her quota to around 16 men on both days of the weekend			2
goal : miss @entity1 's boyfriend is said to be ' not thrilled ' by her plan			1

@entity1 is said to have started her quest in @entity9 last month
she has set up a @entity37 page and a blog to chart her exploits
she reportedly said her boyfriend has ' had to come to terms with it '
