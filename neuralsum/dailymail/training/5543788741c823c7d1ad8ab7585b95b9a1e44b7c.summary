when the @entity1 stood on the brink of nuclear @entity3 during the 1962 @entity4 , president @entity0 sent his wife and children away to stay at the family 's summer farm in @entity9			1
but he pulled his 19 - year - old mistress close , summoning her from her college while he stared down the @entity12			2
later , @entity13 revealed in recently - released interviews that she had begged her husband to keep her , @entity16 and @entity18 close , but instead he turned to @entity19 , the young press intern with whom he conducted an 18 - month affair			1
miss @entity19 revealed this shocking story about the president 's behaviour along with the sordid details of what she says was her ' tender , funny , loving ' relationship with @entity0			1
and despite the shame that she felt for some of the acts she performed and keeping her secret for half a century , she says she would do it all over again			2
the next summer , she claims , he told her to do the same to his baby brother , @entity53			1
but this time , miss @entity19 -- ashamed of what she did with mr @entity51 -- refused			1
the retired @entity57 church administrator says the night before the @entity4 ended , @entity0 sent a limo to @entity59 , where she was studying			1
it picked her up and took her to a hotel near the @entity62 in @entity63			1
' @entity64 knows i did n't belong there , ' @entity67 said			2
but it was surreal and exciting			0
she never saw the president that night			0
it was a waiting game , as she so often played with @entity0			1
at the @entity62 swimming pool , @entity0 asked @entity19 ( pictured ) : ' mind if i join you ? ' she described him as ' remarkably fit - flat stomach , toned arms - for a 45 - year - old man			1
after sliding into the pool , he floated up to me ' in addition to stories of her sex life with the president , she also revealed tender moments she shared with him			2
' he had a collection of little yellow rubber ducks and they were in the bathtub and rubber ducks sort of became part of the game , ' she said in the interview			0
' we had races with rubber ducks in the bathtub			0
' far from being repulsed by his advances , the former church worker also admitted that she found him ‘ unbelievably handsome ’			0
extracts from her memoir have detailed how she was shocked when on her fifth day as a @entity62 press aide he led her away from co-workers who were having cocktails down the hall to his wife ’s bedroom where they had sex for the first time			1
aged 19 at the time , she writes that ‘ short of screaming ’ there was nothing she could do to get mr @entity0 off her			1
taken : @entity19 claims that president @entity0 , seen here with his wife @entity121 , took the young intern to his wife 's room in the @entity62 where she lost her virginity to him but in an interview with @entity42 , miss @entity19 said that she actually meant ‘ overpowered in the sense that he was the president			1
' speaking to today she said : ‘ he was this unbelievably handsome man who was 45 - years - old			2
‘ not overpowered physically as in somebody grabbed me and made me do something that i was n't really willing to do , because i really think i was willing to do it			2
' miss @entity19 added that the first time she met the president the day before at the @entity62 pool , during which time he eyed her up , felt perfectly normal too			1
she said : ‘ it really did n’t feel unnatural because everybody was friendly because everybody went back to work afterwards			0
’ ' even in our most intimate moments , i called him mr president			0
to do otherwise would have seemed inappropriate ' comfortable : miss @entity19 says that her exclusive meetings with the president and his most - trusted staff members felt natural because of how friendly and seemingly open they were miss @entity19 was first ‘ outed ’ in 2003 in a biography of mr @entity0 but she has kept quiet until now			1
asked why she now decided to write her memoirs , she said : ‘ most mornings i thought : ‘ i do n’t want to get up and write this book ’			0
‘ then i thought : ‘ why keep a secret ? why keep silent about something ? you do something because you think it ’s keeping you safe , but in fact it ’s deadly			0
' in the book , ‘ @entity45 : my affair with president @entity0 and its aftermath , ' miss @entity19 writes how she went from being a debutante from a prominent @entity162 family to a @entity62 press aide - and into the president ’s bed			1
handsome : she called him unbelievably handsome helping advance her enthusiasm as a @entity62 press aide to a usual member of his entourage and then , a partner in his bed her lurid claims include allegations that he once made her inhale a sex drug at a debauched party at @entity180 ’s desert ranch			1
' the president asked me if i wanted to try the drug , which stimulated the heart but also purportedly enhanced sex			2
' i said no , but he just went ahead and popped the capsule and held it under my nose			0
he did n’t try it himself			0
this was a new sensation , and it frightened me			0
i panicked and ran crying from the room , ' she writes in her autobiography			0
on another occasion he coerced her into performing a sex act on an aide while he looked on			2
when she thought she was pregnant that same aide arranged for her to see an abortion doctor , even though abortion was illegal at the time			0
encounters : she found the president unbelievably handsome , in her words , and was both happy and comfortable when she met staff for a swim in the @entity62 pool and he showed up , giving her a look up and down it turned out to be a false alarm			1
miss @entity19 , now a 69 - year - old grandmother living in @entity57 , also writes in her autobiography that through their affair she never called mr @entity0 by his first name ‘ @entity216 ’ and always called him ‘ mr president , ' even when they were in bed together			1
miss @entity19 , who ironically went to the same @entity221 's school as @entity0 's wife @entity222 , described @entity0 as ' playful ' , the sex as ' varied and fun ' and said he could be ' seductive and playful '			1
she said they spent a lot of time ' taking baths ' and that if they spent the night together , she would wear his own soft - blue cotton nightshirts			2
but she also revealed complications in the relationship , saying they never kissed , and that she was often subjected to a ' waiting game ' where she was told to stay in her hotel until he called for her			1
personal stories : mr @entity0 reached out to @entity67 following the death of his infant son @entity239 with his wife @entity121 ( pictured ) , whom he shared received letters of remorse with ' best friends ' : @entity51 , pictured with @entity0 in 1963 , and alone in the @entity244 in 1962			1
the new book claims the former president ' dared ' @entity67 to perform sex acts on mr @entity51 while he watched in a different direction for their affairs , miss @entity19 also writes of the president asking her to ' take care ' of his friend , staff member @entity51 , who ' looked a little tense ' in his description while they were swimming in the @entity62 pool			1
published : miss @entity19 's new book , @entity45 : my affair with president @entity0 and its aftermath , provides a never - before told story of life in the @entity62 with the president as his mistress ' it was a dare , but i knew exactly what he meant			1
this was a challenge to give @entity51 oral sex			2
i do n’t think the president thought i ’d do it , but i ’m ashamed to say that i did ... the president silently watched , ' she wrote			2
during the october 1962 @entity4 , where the @entity1 and @entity12 had a nuclear stand - off , he reportedly told her that : ' i ’d rather my children red than dead			1
' in another , more personal moment when her lover reached out to her following the death of his infant son @entity239 , she wrote of their time together seated on a @entity62 balcony while he quietly wept			2
she wrote : ' i had never seen real grief in my relatively short life			0
he invited me upstairs , and we sat outside on the balcony in the soft summer evening air			0
there was a stack of condolence letters on the floor next to his chair , and he picked each one up and read it aloud to me ... occasionally , tears rolling down his cheeks , he would write something on one of the letters , probably notes for a reply			0
but mostly he just read them and cried			0
' miss @entity19 said she saw president @entity0 for the final time at the @entity308 hotel in @entity309 on november 15 , 1963 , just a week before his assassination in @entity311			1
at this point she was due to be married to her college sweetheart , @entity313			0
' he took me in his arms for a long embrace and said , ' i wish you were coming with me to @entity317			0
' and then he added , ' i 'll call you when i get back			0
' i was overcome with sudden sadness			0
' remember , mr president , i ’m getting married			0
' '' i know that , ' he said , and shrugged			0
' but i ’ll call you anyway			0
