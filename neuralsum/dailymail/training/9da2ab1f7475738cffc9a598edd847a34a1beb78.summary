gunfire echoes across the desert plain as a @entity3 army commander , crouched on a dusty ridge , takes his finger off his @entity8 trigger and lifts his binoculars			1
‘ they ’re definitely getting closer , ’ announces @entity10 a few moments later in a theatrical whisper			1
by ‘ they ’ he meant the @entity15 militants fighting @entity3 armed forces , or @entity17 , only a mile and a half away in the village of @entity20			1
thankfully we could only hear their guns , not see them , though that was scant comfort			1
‘ we need your @entity28 warplanes more than ever now , ’ said @entity10 after a long sigh			1
here in northern @entity42 , on the frontline in the battle against @entity47 , @entity28 assistance – any assistance from above , in fact – would indeed be most welcome			1
behind us , at the foot of the @entity54 mountains , the fearful @entity3 town of @entity35 shimmered in the distance			1
its people feel trapped , surrounded – and very scared			1
@entity58 fell to the @entity59 a month ago , only to be reclaimed by the @entity17 a few days later			1
but there are increasing concerns that without the support of coalition jets , it may fall again soon			1
‘ please tell @entity68 that is are all around us , ’ says 22 - year - old @entity65 , who returned home yesterday after fleeing in terror last month with her children , aged two and three			1
her husband stayed to fight with the @entity17			1
there was , she recalls , ‘ a sick feeling of dread in my stomach ’ when the ominous black flags of @entity47 were raised across the town , when its terrorists swept from house to house , pillaging and killing and burning down shops			1
bullet holes scar the walls of buildings , broken glass still carpets the pavements			1
‘ it keeps returning , that feeling			1
i do n’t know how long it will be safe here , ’ says @entity65			2
‘ we all fear them coming back and i am terrified something will happen to my children			2
’ enemy camp : image from an @entity47 video said to show recruits preparing for jihad all over the town , @entity68 ’s name is invoked with an almost strange frequency by both young and old			2
they whooped with joy , they said , when the @entity107 voted in favour of air strikes			1
‘ we keep a close eye on what goes on in @entity28 , ’ explained @entity10 later , a patterned scarf hung around his waist in traditional @entity3 fashion			1
what is decided in your country can make the difference between life and death here			2
’ as if suddenly embarrassed by this melodramatic flourish , he quickly laughed			2
‘ of course , we know the names of @entity125 ’s new signings too			2
’ @entity58 , with a population of around 6,000 , is 30 miles from the city of @entity128 , the oil - rich capital of @entity130 @entity3 , which is has coveted for months			2
buoyed by the capture of @entity133 , @entity42 ’s second largest city , the jihadists managed to reach @entity128 ’s margins in the summer , but were repelled			1
‘ they want to take @entity58 again because it is the last place before @entity128 , ’ said another @entity17 fighter , @entity135			2
‘ it is strategically important to them			2
’ directly opposite the cafe in the centre of the town , where @entity142 sat drinking tea with other @entity17 soldiers yesterday morning , were the burnt remains of an electrical goods store			2
‘ they [ @entity15 ] did this when they were here ; they burnt down a lot of our houses and shops , ’ said @entity142			2
‘ near here they killed a child , a boy , who was fleeing with his mother and father			2
we knew they were coming			2
we could see the black flags flying from their cars			0
we evacuated all the women and children – most went to the mountains – but there was not enough @entity17 to fight back			0
strong holds : the green lines show the increasing hold is has over the region ‘ so we had to retreat and regroup and then we came back after a few days in greater numbers – 600 of us in all from all over the region			0
the @entity59 soon took flight			0
’ it is only now that the women and children are beginning to drift back and many , like @entity65 , already wish they had n’t			0
in their absence the men of the town , ranging in age from 17 to 70 , took up arms			0
few had any military experience			0
they are a volunteer army ready to fight alongside the @entity17			0
three miles away the front line is formed of mounds of earth			0
at the point where @entity10 watched and waited yesterday , there was a cluster of tents , some plastic chairs and the @entity3 flag atop a pole that kept threatening to keel over			0
in all , it is n’t much of a bulwark against marauding terrorists			0
‘ but it ’s the best we ’ve got at the moment ’ , said @entity10			0
alternately peering through his binoculars and aiming his gun , @entity10 said fighting was raging ‘ beyond the clump of trees in the far distance ’			0
he added : ‘ this morning the is took control of @entity208 and another settlement , @entity210 , which is nearby			0
but the @entity17 has now moved in and there is fighting from close quarters			0
it has been going on since nine o’clock this morning			0
’ ' it is vital that @entity28 get involved because it gives legitimacy to our war			1
it means it is not just the @entity219 and a few others , but @entity221 to ' as well as help from above , the soldiers beseech the @entity28 to ‘ send us weapons ’			1
in @entity35 , at least , they possess only archaic rifles and ‘ not enough semi-automatics ’			0
in comparison , the @entity47 terrorists ’ arsenal is sophisticated , much of it the latest hardware from the @entity219			0
at the @entity17 ’s regional hq , a few miles down the dusty desert road to @entity128 , it is this subject that senior commander @entity234 is constantly turning over in his mind			0
‘ air strikes alone are not enough , ’ he said			1
‘ we do n’t need soldiers from @entity28 and @entity219 but we do need some of the marvellous weapons you have in the @entity28			1
‘ the air strikes have helped us a great deal , allowed us to recapture lost land , towns and villages			1
we need more , though , to strengthen our positions around @entity35 and push them [ @entity47 ] further back			0
‘ it is vital that @entity28 gets involved because it gives legitimacy to our war			1
it means it is not just the @entity219 and a few others , but @entity221 too			0
‘ but more sophisticated weapons , are essential if we are to win this war			1
i do not wish to be ungrateful , i was delighted to hear the news about your @entity256 ’s vote			0
’ elsewhere in the hq , which was occupied briefly by @entity47 , a less senior soldier boasted about recent successes			0
‘ we have killed 47 is militants in villages around here in the past week , ‘ he said as he flourished his mobile phone , full of pictures of dead bodies			0
back at the front line , @entity266 had tilted his binoculars upwards and was scanning the skies			0
there was still no news about @entity28 ’s @entity272 – which did not , in fact , strike at is targets yesterday			1
‘ they may be further north around @entity133 , ’ he said			0
perhaps next time for us			0

in @entity42 they ' whooped with joy ' that the @entity107 backed air strikes
and said @entity28 involvement gives ' legitimacy to our war '
but locals also wanted to be supplied with the @entity28 *'s* ' marvellous weapons '
as is
