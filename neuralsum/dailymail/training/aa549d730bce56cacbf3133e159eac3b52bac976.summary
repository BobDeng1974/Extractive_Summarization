‘ she was spreading scare stories about cannabis which are wholly unacceptable , ’ he said			2
‘ there are only small risks with cannabis – it is nowhere near as bad as alcohol			2
‘ she made the right decision to resign and she has been brought to her senses because she was in an impossible position – she could not dispense justice fairly with such strong views against cannabis			2

mr @entity13 , a divorced former advertising executive , has even encouraged his own children , now 26 and 24 , to use cannabis			1
in his letter of complaint , he wrote : ‘ it is clear that you [ mrs @entity1 ] have suffered a family tragedy and it is possible your brother was one of the tiny minority of people who react badly to cannabis			1
‘ however , the scientific evidence is that cannabis is very , very safe – much safer than alcohol , tobacco , all prescription drugs , most over-the - counter medicines and even peanuts			2
’ drugs lobbyist : @entity13 has claimed that cannabis is ' as safe as peanuts ' in the letter , which went to the @entity58 , the 55 - year - old told mrs @entity1 to come to ‘ her senses ’ and stop being ‘ biased ’			1
he wrote : ‘ your conduct in expressing your opinions which diverge so clearly from the facts and evidence is irresponsible , dangerous and entirely unforgiveable			0
please issue a public apology and resign			0
’ mr @entity13 , who became leader of the pro-cannabis group @entity96 in 2011 , has repeatedly lobbied for users to be able to buy the drug in licensed premises			1
‘ the harmful aspects of cannabis are vastly exaggerated , especially by people like mrs @entity1 , and it is only right that we should put these people right			1
' @entity13 he says he has ‘ always been outraged by the law interfering in his life ’ and claims legalisation would cut crime			1
he said : ‘ the harmful aspects of cannabis are vastly exaggerated , especially by people like mrs @entity1 , and it is only right that we should put these people right			2

experience : the 65 - year - old chairman of the bench had cited the ' living hell ' her family went through after losing her brother @entity136 , pictured following the hearing – and mrs @entity1 ’s interviews in local and national media – the @entity58 launched an investigation into the way she had expressed her personal views on the case			1
this was triggered by four complaints including three from retired magistrates – former bench chairman @entity156 and his two former deputies @entity157 and @entity159			0
the retired magistrates used mr @entity13 ’s pro-cannabis arguments when they stated their case against mrs @entity1			1
all the complainants asked for mrs @entity1 to be removed from her position immediately			2
she was suspended but , following a ten - month investigation , the @entity58 opted only to reprimand her			0

as far as i am aware , cannabis is still very much illegal in @entity185 , ’ she added			0
mrs @entity1 , who lives with her husband @entity186 , 65 , in @entity187 , @entity188 , said she ensured justice had prevailed in all her cases			2
