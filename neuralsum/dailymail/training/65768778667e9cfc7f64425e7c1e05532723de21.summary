statins should be given to all over- 50s , regardless of their health history , because they dramatically cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes in later life , one of the @entity9 's leading experts has said			2
currently statins are given only to high - risk patients , around eight million people , who have high cholesterol or have a risk of heart disease			1
but there is ' clear evidence ' that healthy people can also benefit based on their age alone , says professor sir @entity20			1
statins are taken each day by eight million adults in the @entity9 but there is ' clear evidence ' that healthy people can also benefit , it is claimed ( posed by model ) he led the world 's largest study to investigate statins in the prevention of cardiovascular disease which proved that cutting levels of ' bad ' ldl cholesterol in the blood saved lives			1
the risk of having a major vascular event such as a heart attack is cut by one - fifth for each @entity38 ( millimoles per litre ) fall in @entity40 , whether in high or low risk patients			1
but current guidelines on their use - and misguided safety fears about muscle pain and memory loss - are restricting the range of people who can take them , he said			0
' at 50 you should be considering it and whether you should be taking them at an earlier age is an open question ' he said			0
' if you start treatment earlier and continue for longer the benefits will be much greater , you 're not trying to unfur the arteries , you 're preventing them from furring in the first place ' he said			0
prof @entity20 , who was giving a keynote lecture at the @entity61 in @entity62 , said evidence from 130,000 patients taking statins in trials show they are safe			1
professor sir @entity20 says statins should be given to all over- 50s , regardless of their health history yet drug safety watchdogs here and in the @entity72 have insisted on flagging up relatively minor side effects which are putting patients off the drugs , he said			1
these include memory loss , depression , sexual difficulties and depression , while recent research suggests cataracts and diabetes may be more common in patients taking statins			1
trial data shows only one significant side effect , myopathy or muscle pain , which affects one in 10,000 patients , said prof @entity20			2
he said : ' we need to look properly at the safety of statins			0
the reality is that these drugs are remarkably safe , but the problem is that high risk patients are getting the message that these drugs have side effects			1
' prof @entity20 , 57 , went to his gp a fortnight ago to ask about taking statins despite a relatively low cholesterol level , and was dismayed to learn she could not get high risk patients to take them because of fears about side effects			1
research earlier this year co-ordinated by the @entity109 @entity108 , where prof @entity20 is co-director , reviewed findings from 27 statin trials involving 175,000 people , some of whom were at low risk of heart problems			2
the drugs cut the risk of heart attacks , strokes and operations to unblock arteries by one third or more			0
the benefits were gained no matter what level of cholesterol patients started out with			0
healthier people who were given statins also had lower overall death rates than those who were given a placebo			0
it concluded the positives greatly exceeded any side - effects from taking the drugs			0
more than eight million adults are already taking statins , but it is estimated that routine use by the over 50s would lead to 10,000 fewer heart attacks and strokes a year , including 2,000 fewer deaths in the @entity9			1
the small cost of the drugs - as low as Â£ 16 a year - would be outweighed by @entity144 savings due to the reduced number of heart attacks and strokes			0
at present , statins are restricted to those with at least a 20 per cent risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next five years			0
but , said prof @entity20 , trial data shows very low risk groups can benefit where individuals have just a five to 10 per cent chance of heart disease , and even lower			1
he said there did not appear to be a threshold at which the drugs did n't work and the longer they were taken , the greater the benefit			0
' we need to review the guidelines and the current thresholds should go , ' said prof @entity20 , who claimed medical tests such as liver function were also unnecessary			0
professor @entity168 , medical director of the @entity169 , said : ' the issue is where do you set the threshold between low , normal and high risk			2
' the current arbitrary threshold was decided by cost but now statins are off patent ( and much cheaper ) it may be appropriate to see if there are benefits for more people - the threshold is a bit too high , ' he added .			2

currently statins only given to around eight million high - risk patients
but professor sir @entity20 says healthy people can also benefit
he said evidence from 130,000 patients taking statins shows they 're safe
