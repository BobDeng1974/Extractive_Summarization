@entity0 was picking up her youngest child from nursery when the sudden violent explosion shook the @entity5 street			1
when the dust cleared , they would find the 33 - year - old 's body shielding her beloved three - year - old daughter			1
@entity11 - called @entity12 by friends and family - was dead , killed by a rocket launched 80 miles away by a @entity17 rebel			1
in the @entity5 - just a four hour flight away from the safety of the @entity20 - carrying on everyday tasks can prove fatal , and even hiding in your home will not shield you from the rockets the two sides are firing at each other			1
devastated : @entity27 says goodbye to his wife @entity28 , who was killed by a rebel rocket tragedy : the body of @entity32 lies in the street next to the biscuits he had bought from the shop			1
his wife @entity37 was killed seconds later in a separate attack , which saw a missile hit the couple 's balcony since fighting broke out between the @entity5 government and the @entity46 - backed separatists almost a year ago , nearly 6,000 people have been killed			1
the fierce fighting has driven an estimated 1million people from their homes			2
a ceasefire agreed in @entity51 last week , which should have seen both sides start to withdraw from a ' buffer zone ' around the front line from sunday , has had little effect			2
indeed , rebels said they had no intention of observing the ceasefire at @entity59 , where they have been advancing since january and now have a @entity5 unit all but encircled			1
meanwhile , one rebel commander claimed the @entity5 army had broken the ceasefire 27 times in the just 24 hours			1
images of the conflict circulating in western media show tanks , soldiers and the occasional bursts of rockets being launched			2
what they rarely show are the people still trapped between the two warring factions , desperately trying to carry on with their everyday lives - just like millions across @entity78			2
broken : the ceasefire agreed between the two sides is not being stuck to by either the government or rebels clean up : residents who have not fled the battle zones are left to deal with the consequences of the war one million : it is estimated up to a million people have left since the war started almost a year ago destroyed : @entity91 shows of the damage to his flat after last tuesday 's assault on @entity95 so it is easy to forget the countless stories of loss , and the suffering @entity78 has not experienced since the genocidal bloodletting that engulfed the @entity100 in the 1990s			1
on february 10 , @entity28 became another of those countless stories			2
she had left her home in @entity104 , a city to the north of @entity107 , to pick up her daughter from nursery			1
she was in a rush : her seven - year - old son was at home , ill with the flu , and she wanted to get back to him as quickly as possible			2
but she never returned home			2
instead , she was killed by a @entity116 rocket – one of the most sophisticated weapons in @entity46 ’s arsenal - when she was a couple of steps from the entrance to her building			1
several other shells had landed around her , tearing massive holes into the sides of buildings , shattering windows and destroying cars			2
bereaved : nearly 6,000 people have died - including innocent civilians like mother - of - two @entity11 mourning : the graves of fighters without names marked with numbers in the cemetery of @entity138 her neighbours said she ’d thrown herself on top of her daughter to protect her from the explosions			1
shrapnel from the rocket tore into the child ’s arm and killed @entity28 instantly			1
‘ my neighbour told me to call her after we heard the explosions			2
i never thought anything might happen , ’ recalled @entity28 ’s aunt , @entity151 , in her flat saturday			2
‘ she had n’t phoned all day and i knew her son had been ill for a couple of days			1
' normally , her going to the day care earlier than usual would n’t have warranted a phone call , ’ she added			2
her aunt attempted to reach her via mobile phone at least half a dozen times			0
‘ i kept calling and calling … there was no answer			0
i tried again , then again			0
the mobile provider kept giving me a message that she was n’t available			0
' finally i got through and a very hesitant man ’s voice was on the other end , ‘ said @entity151			0
‘ where is my @entity12 ? ’ ‘ she ’s dead			1
a shell exploded and killed her			1
i ’m sorry , ’ said the voice before hanging up			0
i just did n’t know what to do , ' @entity151 said			0
' my neighbour got me together and insisted we go to her flat			0
when we arrived the neighbours told us the emergency teams had taken her to a nearby hospital with all those who ’d been wounded			0
' we rushed there hoping that maybe the man on the phone had been wrong ; maybe she was just hurt and still alive			0
' when we got to the emergency room the doctors told us she was dead on arrival and that they may have to amputate her daughter ’s arm			1
' at @entity28 ’s funeral , relatives and friends as well as her distraught husband decried the on going violence , blaming all involved for waging war on the local population			0
her son has yet to be told of his mother ’s death			0
‘ i wanted to take him to the coffin and let him kiss mummy goodbye			0
i just could n’t do it			0
he keeps asking for her			0
i have no idea what to do , ’ said her husband @entity196 , who works in @entity46			0
‘ the little one in the hospital does n’t speak expect for when asleep , calling out for mum			0
we ’re just happy the doctors did n’t have to amputate , ’ said @entity151			0
‘ we still need to tell her 93 - year - old grandmother			0
she ’s been asking about her for days , wondering why , “ my @entity12 has n’t come to visit			0
” we still do n’t know how to tell her what happened			0
’ on a different part of the city , another family is coming to terms with its own horrendous tragedy - a tragedy which serves to show arbitrary cruelty of this civil war			1
@entity32 , a 62 - year - old former engineer and director at the city ’s @entity219 machine factory , was returning home after buying biscuits a rocket exploded less than five feet away			1
the blast threw him against the wall of the building behind him , nearly blowing off his face in the process			0
killing : people have died on both sides of the conflict			1
here , girls are pictured at a separatist fighter 's funeral waste : it was hoped the ceasefire would bring an end to the deaths of civilians and fighters like this one picking up the pieces : all the people left behind can do is try to continue to live their lives splayed out on the frozen pavement , his newly bought biscuits lay just a few inches from the hand that was carrying them home			1
seconds later , his wife @entity252 - who was awaiting his return home for their midday meal - was killed as a second rocket ripped through the couple ’s balcony			1
all three - @entity28 , @entity32 and @entity37 - were killed in the same spate of attacks last tuesday			1
on saturday , @entity32 ’s former colleagues participated in a citywide vigil for those killed in last tuesday ’s attack			2
far from being unique , it was one of hundreds which have rained down on countless towns in eastern @entity5			1
caught between the combatants , the civilians that are forced to endure the horror of indiscriminate shelling			1
nearly 14,000 people have been wounded since fighting between @entity5 armed forces and @entity278 rebels , backed by regular @entity280 army units , began last april			1
shattered : windows in @entity104 have been blown in by the blasts - letting freezing air into homes destruction : despite the chaos around them , people remain hopeful things might change for the better			1
' it was a lovely flat once , ' @entity91 told @entity290			0
' once all of this is over and @entity294 leaves us alone , it will be again ' as has been the case on dozens of occasions in @entity107 , @entity299 , @entity300 and @entity301 , @entity104 ’s emergency room surgeons had to work frantically to care for the dozens of wounded flooding in the door , while nurses and orderlies were charged with trying to console family members that had packed into the dark hospital corridors			1
‘ my husband is in surgery			0
they wo n’t tell me anything other than to wait			0
he was just at work like any other day , ’ a distraught young woman named @entity310 said in the city ’s main hospital , shortly after last week ’s attack			2
those who survive are left to pick up the pieces ; comforting distraught relatives and cleaning up their shattered homes			0
@entity323 , whose flat is around the corner from where @entity32 and his wife were killed , is one of those people			2
‘ i was sitting here in my bedroom – my husband had just decided to go downstairs to the shop when i heard heavy concussion explosions , ' she told @entity290			0
' luckily , i had just walked into the next room when a shell exploded right outside our balcony			0
' @entity323 and her husband @entity91 , a couple in the mid- 50s , have spent most of their life savings from their meagre earnings as engineers to refurbish their flat in an old stalin - era building in the city centre			1
amid the shattered glass , pock marked walls are the couple ’s charming collection bric - a - brac from their trips to @entity351 , @entity352 and @entity353			2
‘ well , it was a lovely flat once			0
once all of this is over and @entity294 leaves us alone , it will be again , ’ said @entity91 .			0
