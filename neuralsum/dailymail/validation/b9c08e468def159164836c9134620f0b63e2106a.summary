they stood alongside each other , peering anxiously towards @entity2			2
as a sea of red and white jerseys jostled and pointed fingers , sir @entity3 and sir @entity4 never blinked			1
then , as referee @entity8 restored order , @entity3 cracked			1
turning to see who was on the row behind him in @entity14 ’s @entity13 , @entity3 could not help himself			1
suddenly he was beaming , his smile born of elation and contentment : victory had been confirmed			2
winning at @entity14 mattered more to @entity3 than anything else when he shaped @entity21 ’s destiny and retirement has n’t dulled the desire			1
that smile and subsequent tap on @entity4 ’s shoulder , told you everything about how he was feeling			2
sir @entity3 looked delighted by @entity21 's victory over @entity30 at @entity14 on sunday sir @entity3 acknowledges @entity21 supporters upon his arrival for the game against @entity30 sir @entity4 ( centre ) and @entity35 ( left ) were also at @entity14 to see @entity21 win @entity3 takes his seat at @entity14 before @entity21 's game against @entity30 in the @entity39 mind you , he was n’t alone			1
crammed into the @entity14 end , 3,000 @entity21 fans were exultant , noisily acclaiming the finest performance of the @entity45 era : their team had not played with such panache and arrogance here since the mid- 1990s			1
they were going to enjoy this			2
‘ we played them off the pitch in the first half , i think , ’ @entity45 mused afterwards			1
‘ it was the best 45 minutes ( of the season )			0
we scored a fantastic goal , we gave nothing away			0
it really was a superb first half			0
in the dressing room , i gave the players all my compliments			0
’ @entity45 might have been less than impressed by what he in the second half but do not doubt how much satisfaction this win provided			1
as he walked out of @entity14 later to catch the team bus , he stopped and took look around the famous old stadium			1
his contentment was beyond question			0
as well it might have been			0
this was the afternoon when the @entity45 masterplan started to come together			1
for all the @entity30 had shortcomings , the simple truth was that they could n’t get near @entity21 and were lucky that only one goal separated them at the break			1
all over the pitch , @entity21 players stood out like beacons			1
@entity81 , for starters , was terrific in the centre of defence , keeping @entity84 under wraps for much of the game ; @entity87 personified diligence at right back			0
it was in midfield , however , were @entity21 stamped their class			1
@entity92 dominated , setting an aggressive tone ; @entity94 was impressively solid while @entity95 passed the ball with purpose and precision , most devastatingly when he set @entity99 free for the opening goal			0
@entity99 ( left ) acrobatically scores @entity21 's second goal against @entity30 on sunday @entity99 ( right ) slots past @entity30 goalkeeper @entity103 to give @entity21 the lead in the first half @entity99 ( left ) applauds the @entity21 supporters at @entity14 after securing the three points over @entity30 @entity108 provided a sublime assist for @entity99 's opener for @entity21 in the 14th minute at @entity14 ah , @entity99			1
for large parts of the 15 months he has been at @entity114 , you have wondered why they spent £ 37million on him – then you see how he played here , like when scoring that glorious second , and can understand why @entity121 called @entity122 ”			0
@entity35 , for one , was certainly impressed after he had exchanged passes with @entity124 and capped the move with a bicycle kick that arrowed past @entity103			0
‘ what a goal ! ’ @entity35 exclaimed , as he gave @entity128 a hug			0
@entity99 , by contrast , was slightly more circumspect			0
‘ in the last few months i ’ve not had the best moments but i am the same player that i was when i came to @entity133 , ’ he said			0
‘ i have the same passion , the same illusion , but it is the manager who decides			0
but obviously i ’m happy because we played well in a very difficult game			0
’ much has been spoken about @entity21 this year , largely about how they are a pale shadow compared to what has gone before			2
in some respects that is absolutely right : how many of this starting line - up would have got into the treble winning side of 1999 ? probably only @entity145			0
but time moves on and the 2014 - 15 squad are beginning to move in the right direction and what has been most impressive is the reaction they have produced since that chastening night against @entity152 two weeks ago when they were bounced out of the @entity154			0
a 3 - 0 demolition of @entity156 followed by a win against their most bitter rivals has made fourth place @entity21 ’s to lose and that will ensure @entity45 has achieved the objective that he was set by @entity35 when arriving last summer			1
‘ we are coming back and we beat @entity30 again , ’ said @entity163			2
‘ we beat them with their own weapons and pressure on the ball			0
now the gap is five points ahead of @entity30 and six ahead of @entity156 and @entity171 so the moment to win is one of the most important in my career			1
’ @entity21 manager @entity45 ( centre ) described the win as one of the most important of his career @entity21 's players applaud their supporters after their 2 - 1 win against arch rivals @entity30 when he talks about points gaps , maybe @entity45 should really be looking forward than studying what lurks behind			1
after all , they are only eight points behind league leaders @entity187 and there are still eight matches to play			2
@entity21 to be league champions ? perhaps not this year			2
but why ca n’t they finish runners - up ? should @entity45 ’s play as they did at @entity14 on the run to the line , nobody will enjoy to facing them			1
and that , more than anything , will give @entity3 reason to smile again .			2

@entity21 moved five points above @entity30 with @entity14 win
sir @entity3 was *visibly* delighted with the victory on sunday
@entity45 described the win as one of the best of his career
