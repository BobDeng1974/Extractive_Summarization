@entity0 will ask the @entity1 to reopen a landmark case against @entity3 over the use of alleged torture in @entity6			1
on the back of new evidence , @entity7 and other human rights organisations pressed @entity11 to relaunch proceedings in the so - called ' @entity14 ' case			1
they were 14 @entity17 men interned - detained indefinitely without trial - in 1971 who claimed they were subjected to a number of torture methods			1
nine of the @entity23 '			0
( from left - right ) back row : @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 ; middle row : @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 ; front row : @entity34 , @entity35 , and standing side - on @entity37 , the executive director of @entity0 these included five techniques , hooding , stress positions , white noise , sleep deprivation and deprivation of food and water , along with beatings and death threats			1
the men were hooded and flown by helicopter to a secret location , later revealed as a @entity3 army camp at @entity53 , outside @entity54			1
a documentary on @entity59 broadcaster @entity57 in june disclosed fresh evidence that the @entity61 authorised the ' deep interrogation ' tactics at the highest levels			1
confirming @entity0 's approach to @entity67 , foreign affairs minister @entity65 said the fresh evidence was taken very seriously by @entity11 and legal advice was also sought			1
' on the basis of the new material uncovered , it will be contended that the ill - treatment suffered by the @entity73 should be recognised as torture , ' he said			2
the men say they were forced to stand in ' stress positions ' , as demonstrated by these @entity7 campaigners in this file picture , for long periods of time by their @entity3 captors ' the government 's decision was not taken lightly			1
' as @entity85 partners , @entity3 and @entity6 have worked together to promote human rights in many forms and during the original case , the @entity3 did not contest before the @entity1 that a breach of @entity90 of the @entity91 took place			2
' the @entity3 and @entity59 governments have both worked hard to build stronger more trusting relations in recent years and i believe that this relationship will now stand to us as we work through the serious matters raised by these cases which have come to light in recent months			2
' the @entity59 government first took a human rights case against @entity3 over the alleged torture in 1971			1
the @entity105 ruled that the mistreatment of the men was torture , but in 1978 the @entity1 held that the men suffered inhumane and degrading treatment that was not torture			0
the @entity3 did not dispute the finding			2
the men were taken to a @entity3 army camp at @entity53 , outside @entity54 the new evidence , uncovered from national archives in @entity117 by the human rights outfit the @entity118 , throws doubt over the ruling by the @entity1			2
it includes a letter dated 1977 from then - home secretary @entity123 to then - prime minister @entity124 in which he states his view that the decision to use ' methods of torture in @entity6 in 1971/72 was taken by ministers - in particular @entity132 , then secretary of state for defence '			0
mr @entity123 added that ' a political decision was taken '			0
the @entity59 government had until december 4 - six months after the new evidence came to light - to inform @entity67 if it wanted the case reopened			0
a @entity137 case was launched in @entity11 seeking to compel the @entity138 into acting			0
@entity7 said the reopening of the case would help the surviving ' hooded men ' and the families of those who have died to their right to truth and justice ' the @entity3 withheld from the @entity1 what it knew about the terrible suffering deliberately inflicted on them and its being sanctioned at the highest levels of the @entity61 , ' said spokesman @entity37			0
' @entity0 's decision today bravely flies the flag for human rights and the universal and unconditional prohibition of torture			0
' @entity35 , one of the 14 men , said they were absolutely delighted			0
' we 've waited 43 years and we want to thank everyone involved , our legal team and all the researchers who turned up the relevant information in order that we could make a case and we 'd particularly like to thank @entity7 for their assistance , ' he added			0
@entity166 , of the @entity118 , said three successive @entity3 governments had deliberately deceived the @entity67 court over the case , which has since been used to justify techniques in @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173			0
' the recently discovered documents show the @entity3 government withheld vital medical , legal and policy documents from both the @entity1 and the @entity59 government in respect of the case taken by the @entity59 state on torture , ' he added .			1

' @entity73 ' were 14 *catholics* who claimed they were tortured
they said they subjected to beatings , *starvation* and sleep deprivation
it is claimed @entity3 government authorised the ' deep interrogation ' tactics
@entity11 has now approached @entity196 over the allegations
