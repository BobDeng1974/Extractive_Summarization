' the gas chambers were a detail of the war , unless we admit that the war was a detail of the gas chambers ! ' during an interview on @entity37 in @entity38 , mr @entity1 said ' the truth ' should ' not shock anyone ' , and that historical reality should not be used to portray him as anti-jewish			1
' this case was manipulated against me by introducing a hint of anti-semitism , ' said mr @entity1			2
' i challenge anyone to name an anti-semitic phrase in my political life			0
' repeatedly questioned about the @entity49 , mr @entity1 said : ' war is horrible , you know , a piece of shrapnel that tears your stomach , a bomb that decapitates you , a room in which you are asphyxiated , it 's all pretty disgusting , it 's true			2
' @entity60 : reigniting old tensions , mr @entity1 , who is the founding father of the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) and still an @entity24 , said : ' the gas chambers were a detail of the war ' mr @entity1 's daughter , @entity1 , is now the leader of the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) and has tried to steer it away from its anti-semitic and racist roots			1
