file the following under the category of you simply would not have believed it possible if you had not witnessed it with your own eyes			2
at the @entity5 in the shadow of the @entity7 , @entity4 followed up four putting from four feet at the 12th on saturday with another four putt from inside 20 feet on the same hole on sunday			1
‘ i actually holed a decent length putt as well to avoid the second five putt of my life , ’ said @entity4 afterwards			1
how on earth does this happen two days in a row , to the world no 1 of all people ? was the green perched on the side of a rocky mountain ? mood : @entity4 's putting was not up to scratch for the second day in a row , leaving him in a foul mood in fact , it was just more evidence that no sport likes embarrassing its star performers quite like this one			1
as the @entity30 put it , succinctly : ‘ it goes to show we are capable of doing the same things club golfers do every weekend			0
’ @entity4 had been playing beautifully as well			1
he was living up to the promise of a tweet he had dispatched earlier to seize the day and he certainly did that during a wonderfully played front nine of 30 strokes			2
all the momentum was with him , as he holed a 60 yard approach at the par four 7th for an eagle two			0
then came the fateful 12th			0
after a good tee shot to 19 feet , his first putt drifted five feet past the hole , and he pulled that one to leave himself a slippery three footer			0
when that one missed he leaned against his putter for the longest time			0
@entity5 : @entity4 and plenty of others were jockeying for position for the finale to the @entity52 play - offs like the rest of us , he clearly could n’t believe it was happening again			1
when he finally looked in the direction of his ball , he must have been horrified to see if further away from the hole than his previous two putts			0
thankfully he knocked in the six footer , or he might still be there now			0
two pars on that hole instead of a six and a five would have left @entity4 one shot off the lead , rather than playing out the last few holes for pride			1
he did that well enough , birdieing the 16th and 17th for a 66			0
’ there was no point dwelling on it , ’ he said			0
‘ you ca n’t beat yourself up			0
we all know these things happen occasionally			0
’ the good news was that in the context of his season what happened at the 12th is meaningless , and it ’s that way too concerning the @entity52 finale which begins in @entity81 on thursday			0
put : @entity4 followed up four putting at the 12th on saturday with another four putt on the same hole attitude : @entity4 was philosophical when talking about his putting form on social media of the 30 competitors , he will start in third place and in control of his own destiny in the race for the $ 10million bonus			1
as for the @entity5 , @entity94 @entity93 held off a spirited challenge from @entity96 champion @entity96 and @entity97 , who came to grief with a calamitous triple bogey eight at the 17th			1
there was also plenty of high drama in the @entity104 , where little - known @entity94 @entity105 prevailed at the first hole of a play - off against @entity109 @entity108 in the @entity110			1
@entity112 masters : @entity108 enjoyed his best day since 2007 at european masters , coming second what a week this was for 36 - year - old storm			1
he went to @entity116 following a wretched season without a single redeeming top 20 finish , and in grave danger of losing his tour card			2
on saturday he won a £ 100,000 car for a hole - in - one that was more than he had earned all year			2
then on sunday he showed considerable composure to hole a stomach - churning six footer to make the play - off			1
a poor drive cost him , alas , but the runner ’s up prize of £ 178,480 still completed his best week since winning the 2007 @entity130 .			2

@entity4 's putting *woe* *continued* at @entity5
but @entity108 enjoyed his best day since 2007 at @entity112 masters
storm finished second , losing play - off to @entity105
