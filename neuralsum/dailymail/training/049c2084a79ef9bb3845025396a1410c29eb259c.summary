by @entity0 gripping new reality tv show @entity1 wrapped its first season last monday with a shocking baby bombshell , and millions of its eager viewers are waiting with baited breath for tonight 's reunion episode , hoping some important questions will be answered			1
in a surprise twist at the end of last week 's finale , it was revealed that @entity12 , 51 , and his 22 - year - old girlfriend @entity13 - who the last we knew had broken up - had actually welcomed their first child together , baby @entity17			1
in the last nine months since the cameras stopped rolling , a reconciliation clearly occurred between the troubled pair after they learned they were expecting , and they now appear to be thriving in a state of parental bliss , with @entity12 posting gushing photos of his new daughter @entity27 to his @entity29 account			1
doting dad : @entity12 , 51 , ( left ) , star of new reality tv show @entity1 , proudly introduces his first child , baby @entity33 , ( right ) on @entity29 with the caption ' i 'm raising a future captain of industry ! ' since the cameras packed up and left , the couple began shacking up in @entity41 , @entity42 after spending last summer in the @entity43			1
last week 's finale introduced baby @entity33 to its shocked viewers in the last minute of the episode , following straight after footage of @entity12 dumping his philanderess girlfriend after she admitted to sleeping with his friend , @entity48			1
the last scene of the finale , however , was tranquil and the parents looked entirely content			0
normally lithe @entity13 's baby weight added to the feeling that things settled down for the duo as they entered into parenthood			1
cute as a button : @entity58 , now five weeks old , was born on march 24th , seen here in the first photo her father @entity12 shared of her on @entity29 surprise ! @entity13 , 22 , ( right ) , the new mother and much younger girlfriend of @entity12 , swaps gleeful expressions with baby @entity33 ( left ) southern mini-belle : @entity33 ( pictured ) 's arrival was a shock to viewers , who last saw her parents @entity12 and @entity13 break up at the end of the first season 's finale but missing from the footage is any indication of what happened between the breakup and birth			1
things did n't look good for young @entity13 when the finale opened with foppish @entity48 finally confessing to @entity12 that he had slept with his friend 's then 21 - year - old flame - haired girlfriend			1
@entity12 forgave his chum but wanted @entity13 to come clean without his prodding			2
hands on father : @entity12 , who had previously experienced a false pregnancy alarm with @entity13 during an earlier episode , realized he wanted a baby ' for real ' - and happily , he got his wish soon after vocal : ' @entity33 is starting to make her needs known - i need ear plugs ! ' @entity12 exclaimed during a recent interview missing mom : bundle of joy : @entity13 shared this photo of her ' sweet pea ' over the weekend during a flyby visit to @entity104 with @entity12 ' we never had anything serious , ' @entity13 said as she and @entity12 got ready for @entity48 's long anticipated july 4th soiree			1
the rest of the gang managed to get through the party without scrapping with outsider @entity13 , but it was when she and @entity12 returned home that tempers truly flared			2
after a heated argument , she admits to @entity12 : ' i hooked up with @entity48			0
' @entity104 moment : @entity12 ( front left ) shared this snap of the cast of @entity1 at a hip meatpacking restaurant last week new life : in last week 's finale , the couple ( pictured ) appeared happy and relaxed as they settled into their new roles as parents darling : the adorable baby girl has one of her mother 's family names , @entity131 , as a middle name in honor of ancestor @entity131 , the seventh vice president devoted : one scene showed @entity12 cradling his baby girl , with a monogrammed spit up cloth tossed over his shoulder the secret was out and the couple broke up shortly after a july 4th party at @entity48 's new apartment			1
baby weight : @entity13 showed off a fuller figure following the birth of her first baby but the show 's vixen was harboring another secret that leaked a week before the finale aired , and was finally shown to the world last monday			1
while the credits rolled , viewers were introduced to the baby girl they welcomed march 24th			1
judging from what was shown , @entity13 did not know she was pregnant when @entity12 dumped her , citing their 29 year age gap through his tears			2
she fled his @entity159 home barefoot , clutching a few possessions and her laptop as her much older boyfriend chased her down for a last hug			0
prior to the break - up , @entity12 and @entity13 , made headlines for a previous pregnancy false alarm , which became a major story arc in the first season			1
@entity13 's pregnancy scare was all the more dramatic when it remained unclear if it was @entity12 who was the potential father or another of her conquests , fellow star and self - proclaimed rascally raconteur , @entity174			1
lucky for everyone , except perhaps the show 's rabid fans , @entity13 did not end up being pregnant that time			2
while @entity12 seemed extremely relieved when his gal pal 's test came back negative , he told @entity181 's @entity180 that he felt the opposite when he met his bouncing baby girl in march			1
' i hooked up with @entity48 ' : tempers had flared earlier in the finale episode when @entity12 ( left ) finally got a tearful @entity13 ( right ) to admit she had slept with @entity48 , leading to a dramatic break up scene drama : she fled his house and ran to her @entity191 barefoot , clutching her laptop , after he delivered what seemed to be a final blow to their pairing ' it 's really a blessing , ' he said			1
' it 's one of the greatest creations one could ever hope to be a part of ! ' in fact , it was the scare itself that showed @entity12 just how much having a baby with @entity13 would mean to him			1
' i 'm getting on in my age and i wanted a child , ' he said			0
' and after we had wrapped up shooting in @entity159 , we had both decided we wanted to have a baby for real			0
we both love each other and care about each other			0
' tears : @entity12 came back inside , kept sobbing , and sat in a chair and the credits rolled			0
it seemed their relationship with done for good , as well as season one of @entity1 the new mom is doing well , too , @entity12 said			2
' she has tremendous motherly instincts , ' he said			0
' she 's been constantly reading books about babies and doing her homework			0
she is all over her new responsibilities			0
' she has the energy and the mindset to make sure the baby is well taken care of			0
i 've really grown to respect and admire her			0
' fertile for ground for drama : @entity13 and @entity12 in an earlier episode which showed the couple in a doctor 's office as they anxiously awaited @entity13 's pregnancy test results - which turned out to be negative so will the happy couple be getting married any time soon ? ' we 've been talking about it , ' he said			1
' eventually i 'd like to get married			0
all i can say is stay tuned			0
' for now , they 're just focused on learning to be parents			0
' @entity33 is starting to make her needs known - i need ear plugs , ' he said			0
' but everyone 's healthy and happy and we 're just blessed			0
' arrests : @entity12 once served months in prison on felony cocaine charges and recently pleaded guilty to a dui			2
and this 2012 mugshot of @entity13 was snapped after she was hauled in for underage alcohol possession despite not initially being a main cast member , @entity13 's presence on the show is fertile ground for cultivating the canniest of drama , intrigue and southern seduction			2
when the local celebutante , political scion and model was hauled into @entity271 jail for underage drinking and disorderly conduct in 2012 , authorities snapped the sexy mugshot of the century			0
for fans wondering how @entity13 got to join the soapy series ' main cast members in their drunken antics : the 5ft 11in redhead turned 21 by the time she showed up to heighten the show 's already impossibly high drama			2
earlier times : @entity13 ( right ) caused a stir when she first made an appearance on the show as a minor character , and proceeded to turn @entity12 ' ( right ) life upside down and @entity13 may just be the perfect match for millionaire former real estate developer turned felon @entity12 , even with the 30 - year age gap			2
like @entity13 , @entity12 also has a history of booze - fueled lawbreaking			2
he pleaded guilty just last march to driving drunk while summering in @entity294 , @entity104 last july			0
the former @entity296 presidential campaign chairman had his license suspended for six months and was fined $ 1,400 , according to the @entity298			0
