by @entity1 reporter they were the sort of holiday postcards that cried out : ‘ wish you were here ! ’ to the folks back home			2
children playing in the sun with their buckets and spades and charabancs disgorging their hordes of happy passengers at resorts as far afield as @entity16 and @entity17			2
hole in one : players in floral skirts and bright jackets make a breezy day at @entity22 beach and crazy golf course in @entity24 look better than any exotic holiday picture perfect : no one has sand in their sandwiches in this wholesome image of the sunny seaside at @entity34 harbour , near @entity17 in @entity35 roll up , roll up : from a helter skelter to a carousel , visitors are guaranteed to have a good time at @entity41 fun fair in @entity42			2
lines of bunting and colourful rides create a sense of nostalgia inspiring : this tranquil river scene , where swans bob on the glassy water and willows hang overhead in @entity52 , could feature in a @entity54 sonnet @entity55 : the distinctive architecture of the @entity57 comes to the fore in this image of the @entity60 in @entity61 anyone for a spot of fishing ? the tall masts of fishing boats at @entity67 complete the perfect snap of a seaside promenade these are the iconic , idyllic summertime scenes from the @entity57 created by @entity72 - born photographer @entity71 , whose encapsulation of happy holidays are currently featured in @entity75 , an exhibition at @entity78 ’ gallery			1
it is no coincidence that each one appears to have come straight from a glossy brochure , because @entity71 , who used the ground floor of his house as studio and production department , was meticulous in making sure every scene looked just right — even down to removing or covering up eyesores			1
‘ we were given instructions to get the best shot possible , no matter how long it might take ’ said @entity89 , one of the small team of photographers recruited to @entity71 ’s burgeoning business			1
splash of colour : a swathe of identical beach huts in pastel colours , painted two - by - two at @entity102 in @entity35 look artificial against the backdrop of craggy cliffs and waves not - so - natural : the artificial - looking grass in the foreground of this photograph gives @entity110 's @entity109 an otherworldly feel taking the plunge : the azure blue of @entity16 's popular outdoor bathing pool draws the eye in contrast to the muted colour of the sea behind revving up : a crowd gather to watch motor racing at @entity121			2
the scene , bursting with detail and energy , shows the style of the era off , both in fashion and motors ‘ and it often took several weeks to capture a single postcard snap			0
’ @entity71 also wanted people in his postcards — ‘ they gave the picture life , a point of interest and more importantly a blob of colour ’ — and was not averse to getting his @entity140 editors to remove unsightly telegraph poles or make dull colours more vibrant			1
born in @entity143 , @entity72 , @entity71 was the great - grandson of @entity144 , founder of the town ’s @entity145			1
he worked as a war photographer capturing @entity148 , then in 1949 he briefly put down his camera to work as a pr manager for @entity152 and @entity153 circuses where he met his wife , @entity154 , a trapeze artist			0
on the river : the historic @entity156 to @entity158 ferry in @entity35 takes off with just four cars on board			0
two boys watch on in amazement as the ferry sets off on its journey the perfect way to spend a day : the photographs of outdoor activites and nature at its finest would encourage the laziest of viewer to get out of the house and embrace the great outdoors psychedelic : a rare nighttime photograph highlights the neon colours of a the funfair in great @entity61 , giving the photograph a dynamic feel but he went back to photography and founded @entity71 in @entity181			1
over the next decade he produced idealistic and nostalgic images of @entity183 for postcards which still sell in their millions today			0
he was also responsible for a series of photographs of @entity188 holiday camps which made him proprietor of one of the biggest postcard companies in the world			1
in 1972 he sold the company to pursue a love of painting which took his family to @entity198 , where he died aged 81 in 1997			0
postcards , an exhibition from @entity201 is on show at @entity203 , 16 to 18 @entity204 , @entity205 until october 6			0
plain sailing : the sere - looking boating lake in @entity209 , @entity207 is a haven for young rowers , who can paddle around safely as their parents watch on paddling perfection : happy children at play in a lido @entity217 , @entity218			1
the pastoral background of a church spire , chimney tops and lush trees adds a tranquil element to the dynamic image @entity226 view : caravans form a regular pattern as they are parked side - by - side in neat rows at @entity231 , @entity35			0
their owners could n't get much closer to their sea view - they 're almost on the sand full of life : from the shoppers storlling along the pavement to the queue outside the ice cream van , the promenade at @entity242 , @entity236 is bursting with action ship ahoy ! two boys approach an anchored ship in @entity247			0
from the fluffy clouds to perfect blue sky and lighthouse , it 's a perfect @entity252 's day do you dare ? the winding roller coasters at the famous pleasure beach in @entity256 may not look up to today 's health and safety standards , but they look like a lot of fun			0

the *remarkable* photographs were taken by @entity71 , @entity262 and @entity89
photographers ' quest for perfection involved removing unsightly *objects* or eyesores from the scenes
