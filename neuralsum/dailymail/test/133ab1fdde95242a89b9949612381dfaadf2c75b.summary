she 's a professional equestrienne and was happy to have a go at wheelchair rugby , a sport nicknamed ' murder ball ' , during last september 's @entity5			2
now @entity6 , 33 , has turned her hand to barrel - pulling - and laughingly pretended to pull her 16st 6ft rugby player husband @entity8 along while striking a pose for the cameras			2
the moment came during a charity event to mark the end of personal trainer @entity15 's marathon barrel - roll from @entity16 to @entity17			1
taking the strain : @entity6 straps herself into mr @entity15 's barrel - pulling harness pull ! @entity6 pretends to move off while husband @entity20 from his perch on the barrel @entity15 , who set off nine days and 517 miles ago , rolled the whisky barrel for 12 hours a day , only stopping to sleep and take part in comedy gigs at pubs along the way			1
the @entity29 trek also saw @entity15 , who was the personal trainer on @entity31 's @entity15 , joined by comedians including @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			1
actress @entity36 launched the challenge at the @entity38 last week , while @entity6 was at the finish line at the @entity41 recovery centre			1

' it was good , ' said the 36 - year - old afterwards			0
' i would like to say that i did all the hard work but i just got the glory run in with him			0
all smiles : @entity6 , who gave mr @entity15 a hug as he arrived ( right ) , certainly appeared to enjoy the experience good effort : mr @entity15 , centre , rolled the barrel 517 miles from @entity16 to @entity17 joking around : @entity6 , who is working towards 2016 's @entity57 , struck a series of poses in the harness support : @entity6 had turned out to watch mr @entity15 and husband @entity62 the finish line ' i think the most impressive thing about him is that he is just a bit of a joker and he was telling stories about putting deep heat on people 's hats to make their eyes water			1
' he was talking about keeping his mind entertained and having a laugh			0
the one thing you see with people who have been around the military is that when they are in adversity or a tough place they always know how to have a laugh and how to make time pass			0
