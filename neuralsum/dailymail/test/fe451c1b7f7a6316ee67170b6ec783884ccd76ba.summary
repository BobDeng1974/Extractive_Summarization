@entity0 , 62 , was found with a hoard of explosive ingredients and recipes for bombs in his flats a former @entity8 doctor has been jailed after police discovered a hoard of explosive ingredients and bomb - making instructions at his home			1
@entity0 had dozens of chemicals , poisonous materials , bolts and handwritten notes on how to make a bomb , a court heard			1
the equipment was found purely by chance in april last year after a fire at a block of flats in the @entity27 area of @entity28			1
firefighters , who were responding to a 999 call over a fire within a rubbish chute on the 11th floor , had forced entry to a flat registered to @entity0 and found jars containing various powders			1
castor beans , which can be used to make ricin , were also found			1
the building was evacuated while the police and army @entity42 ( @entity43 ) experts were called in to test the substances - some of which were years old			1
@entity0 also had a small amount of a highly volatile explosive lead picrate which was so dangerous that the @entity49 refused to take delivery of it and it was destroyed			0
a search was carried out at a further block where the 62 - year - old lived with his wife in @entity56 and a further haul of material was recovered			1
both blocks of flats were evacuated and the areas around them sealed off			2
@entity0 said the materials were used for cleaning and as fertiliser but in february he pleaded guilty to a breach of the 1883 @entity67			1
police seized bomb - making instructions and equipment including a bag containing an electrical circuit ( pictured ) from the properties two @entity76 's @entity75 jars were found being used to store a small amount of a highly volatile explosive , lead picrate sentencing him to three years and four months in prison , judge @entity79 said : ' you assembled large quantities without lawful purpose and some were stored in a high rise flat in a densely populated area			1
' the number and nature of the explosive substances and the places you chose to store them lead me to conclude there is no alternative to a custodial sentence			0
' the court heard that much of the bomb - making equipment , which also included electrical circuits , had been ordered from online retailers			1
defence qc @entity101 said : ' what seems to be clear from the narrative and material is that it has been directly ordered from legitimate companies , mainly through @entity106			0
' the material has always been delivered to domestic addresses and paid for by genuine credit cards registered to mr @entity110			0
' it has always been done in the open and over a period of time			0
many of the items have never been opened			0
@entity0 pleaded guilty to a breach of the 1883 @entity67 after officers seized dozens of explosive ingredients ' it is difficult to understand the hoarding of this material but it does appear that he is someone who has some kind of academic interest in the materials			1
' it seems he has accumulated materials with some kind of peculiar interest in the subject without ever intending to do anything or make anything			0
' detective superintendent @entity133 , who led the investigation , said : ' this was a significant and complex inquiry for @entity137 , to safely deal with these volatile items and seek to establish @entity0 's motives for storing them			0
' a thorough investigation by the @entity142 and @entity143 and @entity144 found no known links to terrorist offences and we believe @entity148 was acting independently			1
however , he showed utter disregard for the occupants of both buildings			0
' thanks to the swift actions of our partners in the @entity155 and armed forces , we were able to quickly assess the contents of the flats and make them safe by removing a number of items for forensic examination or controlled explosion			2
the items from the flats in @entity28 were discovered by chance during a fire within the rubbish chute which was then evacuated whilst the items were recovered ' i am also grateful to the @entity171 for their work to re-house vulnerable residents whilst we carried out our searches			1
' public safety was at the forefront of our response to this incident and all agencies worked together to minimise any risk to the public			0
' @entity184 's activities went unnoticed for many years , demonstrating the importance of community vigilance in our efforts to keep @entity188 safe			2
' counter terrorism is one of @entity137 's highest priorities , and whilst @entity0 has no such known links we will always treat all information received with the utmost importance where any risk to the public is identified			0
' @entity0 , who was born in @entity197 and raised in a @entity199 family , trained as a doctor in @entity201 but has never practised medicine in @entity203 after arriving here in 1984			0
he was the full - time carer for his wife , who suffers from schizophrenia , and has had @entity203 citizenship since 1998			2
police and army @entity42 ( @entity43 ) experts had to be called in to remove the explosive materials @entity211 , the @entity144 's @entity212 and counter-terrorism , added : ' the conviction of @entity0 is a good example of agencies working closely together to protect the public			2
' @entity0 possessed a significant number and volume of explosive substances across two properties in @entity28 as well as recipes for explosives			2
' we worked closely with @entity137 and other agencies to prepare the case to ensure that @entity0 was brought to justice			0
