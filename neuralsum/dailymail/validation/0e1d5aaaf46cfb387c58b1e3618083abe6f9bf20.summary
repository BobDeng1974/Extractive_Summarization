a good sex life wo n’t just improve your mood , it could also boost your brainpower			1
a study found that the more satisfied a person was with their love life in their 60s and 70s , the sharper their mind and the better their memory			2
one possibility is that an active sex life keeps the brain young			1
the finding follows a recent @entity18 study which revealed that age is no barrier to an active love life			0
@entity23 researchers found that people in their 70s having sex were better able to use their memory , file photo the @entity30 study found , more than half of men and almost a third of women aged 70 - plus are still sexually active			1
and one third of these have sex at least twice a month			0
the latest study involved quizzing more than 1,700 @entity23 men and women about their sex life and their need for intimacy			1
the volunteers , who ranged in age from 58 to 98 , were also put through a battery of mental tests , designed to assess everything from memory to the ability to think abstractly			2
two - thirds of the men and women had a partner and a similar number said that they still felt the need for intimacy			0
those who were satisfied with their sex life and said that sexuality was important did better on the tests			2
the link was particularly strong in women , the @entity61 of @entity62 reports			0
the researchers , from the @entity66 mental health centre , ca n’t be sure if staying sexually active was keeping the brain or if interest in sex dwindles as the mind fails			1
however , previous research has credited having sex with the growth of new brain cells , in rats at least			0
it has also been suggested that doing a crossword is better for the brain than an orgasm – because it gives the whole brain a workout , rather than just one area of it			0
researchers have found that rats can boost their brain power by having more sex than normal the @entity23 researchers said it is important not to assume that sex is just for the young			1
they wrote : ‘ many beliefs about sexual behaviour in older populations are based on personal and stereotyped views of ageing and sexuality			0
‘ older persons are generally expected to no longer be capable of or to be lacking interest in sex when , in reality , many elderly persons require sexuality to be important and wish to remain sexually active as they age			1
‘ age itself is no adequate predictor of sexuality ; the reality of ageing is that most people continue to have sexual feelings of some sort			0

*university* researchers found that sex in later life helps boost memory
more than half of men and a third of women over 70 are sexually active
one third of the old people surveyed *admitted* having sex twice a month
@entity23 researchers quizzed people aged between 58 and 98
they also *subjected* them to a battery
