by @entity0 last updated at 8:46 am on 18th november 2011 there may be 15 years between them but it seems that age is nothing but a number to @entity7 and @entity8			1
the @entity10 singer has shared a passionate kiss with the 32 - year - old star and now it seems the pair enjoyed dinner together on tuesday night			0
@entity8 , 17 , believes he 's found ' the one ' according to his fellow band mate , @entity15 , but his fans are less fond of her as the star has apparently been receiving death threats			1
scroll down to watch a video of @entity8 talking about @entity7 out together : @entity7 and @entity8 were spotted enjoying an intimate dinner together at the @entity22 hotel on november 15 @entity7 took to her @entity24 page this morning to deny the rumours saying : ' @entity27 fans ! to clarify			1
i 'm close friends with harry			0
. he 's one of the nicest people i know ... i do n't deserve death threats			0
: ) x. ' hardcore fans of the boy band , and @entity8 in particular , have been out in force on the social networking site over the past 24 hours			1
many have been making humorous comments and digs at the news , whilst others have been supporting @entity7 - insisting that those who post death threats are giving them a bad name			2
speaking out : @entity7 decided to squash the rumours by taking to her @entity24 page early this morning one fan was obviously so fed up of hearing the rumours that they write : ' i do n't even care anymore			2
if @entity8 wants to date an oldie let him be			2
' other fans joked about the age gap by saying : ' it 's okay , i 'm close friends with the toddler down my road too			0
' but others decided to stick up for the tv star with matty1dir tweeting : ' if you love harry ... you wont give @ carolineflack1 any of this ! she said they are friends : ) thats it ! @entity68 wouldnt want you being nasty ! ' @entity69 up : hardcore fans of the boy band member have been tweeting about the rumours of him dating an older woman the rumours were fueled when @entity76 revealed that @entity7 and @entity8 were seen sharing desserts at a restaurant in @entity79 in @entity80 and were being very open about being out together			1
' they were clearly enjoying being together and did n't seem to care who saw them , ' said a source			0
' two other friends joined them while they were eating , but it was clear they only had eyes for each other			0
' however their night did n't end there , as @entity8 and @entity7 were seen getting into the same taxi and leaving together - something else they were n't bothered about hiding			1
bit of an age gap : the tv presenter is 15 years older than 17 - year - old @entity8 the @entity99 host was first linked to the boy band member last month after it emerged that they had kissed whilst on a night out			1
but it seemed it was more than just a kiss to @entity106 as he took to his @entity24 page to write : ' sometimes things happen and you suddenly get a whole new outlook on life			0
' things seemed a bit awkward between the pair on last weekend 's show as @entity7 and her co-host , @entity117 , interviewed @entity10			2
' close friends ' : @entity7 was pictured hugging @entity10 's @entity119 after the band 's appearance in @entity122 but she stayed away from @entity8 and @entity8 hinted at his love for older women when he was asked which of the current female contestants on the show was his favourite			1
' they 're all a bit young for me , ' he replied , even though they are all the same age of older than the boy bander			0
unfortunately though his comments have angered the group 's hardcore fans and has forced @entity7 to deny their close relationship			0
this is not the first time @entity7 has been linked to a @entity8 as she was reported to have had a brief relationship with prince @entity8 two years ago , but he is believed to have called time on their romance after he revealed he was still in love with his heiress ex @entity145			1
more than just a record deal : @entity8 may have enjoyed success with @entity10 following the @entity122 but it seems he may have found ' the one ' too			0
