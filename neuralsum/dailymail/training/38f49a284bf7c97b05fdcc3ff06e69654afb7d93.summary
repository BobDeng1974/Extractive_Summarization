@entity1 officials today said they are ready to provide an anti-flu drug as a potential treatment to fight the rapidly expanding ebola outbreak			1
chief cabinet secretary @entity5 said @entity1 may respond to emergency individual requests for the favipiravir tablet , before any official decision by the @entity9			1
the drug , developed by a subsidiary of @entity12 to treat novel and re-emerging influenza viruses , was approved by the @entity1 health ministry in march			1
it is available at any time , at the request of @entity9 , officials said today			1
male nurse @entity19 , 29 , was airlifted back to @entity20 after contracting the deadly virus while trying to save lives in @entity23 a @entity1 firm , a subsidiary of @entity12 , said it has 20,000 doses of the flu drug favipiravir available to treat ebola victims , after the drug proved effective treating mice infected with the deadly virus , pictured it comes as a the first @entity33 victim of the outbreak , nurse @entity19 , 29 , was airlifted back to @entity20 after contracting the deadly virus while trying to save lives in @entity23			1
despite the grave dangers , he had selflessly volunteered to serve in a makeshift clinic where other nurses had died from ebola or were too scared to come into work			0
mr @entity19 last night arrived back to @entity20 in an isolation sack for treatment at the @entity43 in north @entity20			1
last night the @entity44 started a global hunt for remaining supplies of the only treatment thought to combat the virus			1
@entity49 , an untested drug only ever used on a handful of patients , has shown promising results , apparently aiding the recovery of two @entity56 missionaries who contracted the virus			1
but @entity57 , the @entity56 company behind it , says stocks are exhausted			1
a source at the @entity61 said : ' we are working with our international partners to source remaining doses for the patient			1
' the @entity9 said earlier this month that it is ethical to use untested drugs on ebola patients given the magnitude of the outbreak			1
@entity12 spokesman @entity71 said ebola and influenza viruses are the same type and theoretically similar effects can be expected on @entity77			0
the @entity33 man infected with the ebola virus is loaded into an @entity81 ambulance after being flown home on a @entity84 plane from @entity23 , at @entity86 air base outside @entity20 he said the drug has also proved effective in lab experiments on mice			1
@entity90 said it has favipiravir stock for more than 20,000 patients			0
the company is also in talks with the @entity96 on clinical testing of the drug in treating @entity77			0
@entity99 is one of only a few drugs that may work on ebola			0
several drugs are being developed for ebola treatment			2
but they are still in early stages and there is no proven treatment or vaccine for the highly fatal disease , and @entity12 's drug is one of only a few new drugs that may work on ebola			2
@entity99 inhibits viral gene replication within infected cells to prevent propagation , while conventional ones are designed to inhibit the release of new viral particles to prevent the spread of infection , the company said			0
recently , two @entity56 , dr @entity122 and aid worker @entity123 , have been treated with another experimental drug called @entity49 , developed by @entity125 @entity57			1
the drug had never been tested on humans , although an early version had been found to work in some ebola - infected monkeys			0
it is aimed at boosting the immune system 's efforts to fight the disease			0
mr @entity19 is the only @entity134 to be have ever been infected by ebola outside the laboratory			1
the only other @entity33 case was in 1976 , when scientist @entity138 pricked himself with a needle contaminated with the virus			2
health officials last night said mr @entity19 was ' not seriously unwell ' â€“ a factor which will significantly boost his chance of survival			1
most patients die of ebola because of dehydration , when their blood vessels break down and their major organs fail			0
but fit , young patients who are given quick treatment have a vastly improved chance of survival			0
if they are hydrated and the bleeding controlled , their immune systems can in some cases kick in , and defeat the virus			0
pictures have emerged of the moment a @entity33 charity worker was evacuated back to the @entity33 on board a @entity81 jet the patient was flown into an airport near @entity20 , then driven across the capital @entity33 charity worker , mr @entity19 , from @entity167 in @entity168 , was diagnosed with ebola and airlifted out of @entity23 and taken to the @entity170 at the @entity43 in @entity20 ( pictured ) experimental serum @entity49 was created from a combination of antibodies in january			1
until the drug was given to the @entity56 ebola sufferers , it had only been tested on monkeys			2
it is unclear exactly how it works but both dr @entity122 and @entity123 recovered from @entity77 after receiving the serum			1
it is only available in limited supplies as larger scale human testing is needed to prove it safe and effective			0
the companies behind the drug , @entity49 and @entity187 are currently working to have the product approved and the production accelerated			2
the companies said in a statement : ' it is important to note that the emergency use of an experimental medicine is a highly unusual situation			0
' as a consequence global high - level discussions concerning the policy , ethical , and medical implications of this exceptional situation have been initiated			0
' the @entity9 has put the number of people infected with the deadly ebola virus at 2,615			2
some 1,427 have died since the disease was identified in @entity204 in march , before spreading to @entity23 , @entity205 and @entity206			2
rigorous quarantine measures are used to stop the spread of ebola , as well as high standards of hygiene for anyone who might come into contact with sufferers			0
symptoms of the virus appear as a sudden onset of fever , intense weakness , muscle pain , headache and sore throat			0
this is followed by vomiting , diarrhoea , rash , impaired kidney and liver function and , in some cases , both internal and external bleeding			0
the effects of the disease normally appear between two and 21 days after infection			0
it is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through person - to - person transmission			0
the @entity9 said the disease can be passed between people by direct contact - through broken skin or mucous membranes - with the blood , secretions , organs or other bodily fluids of infected people , and indirect contact with environments contaminated with such fluids			2
treatment : the hospital is the only centre in the @entity33 equipped to treat ebola and prevent the disease from spreading @entity56 doctor @entity122 is pictured saying goodbye to the team that saved him at @entity255 in @entity256 , @entity257 after he was successfully treated for ebola using the experimental drug @entity258 aid worker @entity123 , pictured with her husband @entity260 , was also treated at the @entity256 hospital using @entity262			1
manufacturers of the drug say stocks of the drug are exhausted the @entity267 ( @entity267 ) issued updated travel advice last week which urged people to carefully assess their need to travel to @entity23 , @entity204 and @entity205			1
' general medical facilities throughout @entity23 are currently under severe strain due to the @entity77 outbreak , and unable to provide the same standard of healthcare as in the @entity33			1
' dedicated healthcare facilities for @entity77 are overwhelmed , ' the @entity267 warned			0
the @entity23 parliament has voted to pass a new law which means anyone caught hiding an @entity77 patient can receive prison terms of up to two years			2
some 910 cases have been recorded in the country - and 392 deaths - but the @entity9 believes the magnitude of the outbreak has been underestimated because people are hiding infected friends and family in their homes			2
the @entity9 reported that corpses are being buried in rural villages without notifying health officials and with no investigation of the cause of death			2
in some instances epidemiologists have travelled to villages and counted the number of fresh graves as a rough estimate of suspected cases .			0
