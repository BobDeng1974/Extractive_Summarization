by @entity0 published : 19:43 est , 26 august 2012 updated : 03:32 est , 27 august 2012 a mobile dna testing facility ensconced in an jury - rigged @entity2 has been cruising @entity4 of late , picking up street hails as if it were a taxi and offering on - the - spot dna testing			1
the owner of the @entity8 - or as he calls it , a mobile medical facility - says he caters to family cases like long - lost sisters			1
but @entity13 does n't really make any bones about who it 's really pitching , cheekily emblazoning the question , ' @entity17 on the vehicle 's side			2
scroll down for @entity20 @entity17 : mobile facility is ensconced in a jury - rigged , blue - and - brown @entity2 that is cheekily emblazoned with the question , ' @entity17 ' on its side the clinic started in 2010 but was revamped two months ago			1
the facility , owned by @entity13 , which was founded by @entity26 ( pictured ) , caters to a variety of clients , including returning soldiers who want to confirm the paternity of newly - born babies indeed , the 28 - foot brown - and - blue @entity8 looks more like a mobile home than a medical facility , but the interior does provide the service it promises , starting at $ 299			1
' it 's just such a serious , fundamental question ... who are your children ? who are your parents ? ' @entity26 , the founder of @entity13 , told @entity41			0
@entity26 also drives the @entity8 , stopping much like a taxi cab for passersby who hail it on the street for impromptu paternity tests			2
one @entity4 , who declined to give his name discovered he was the dad of a long - lost daughter he had fathered with a woman he had dated some 20 years ago			1
the 44 - year - old married father of two - make that now three - confirmed the paternity in july			1
' this issue is still raw and very sensitive , ' he said			0
' i will get to know my daughter ... this is something i 'm taking one day at a time			0
' inside the facility , technicians take dna samples , which are then packaged and shipped off to an @entity62 laboratory			2
results are returned three to five business days later			0
mandatory prescriptions from a physician can be faxed via the internet to waiting techs			0
experts say there has been a steady increase in demand for such tests in the @entity74 , reaching close to 500,000 a year - in part to the uptick in births to unmarried women			2
@entity26 's mobile dna - testing facility is ensconced in a brown - and - blue improvised @entity2 that makes no bones about its mission cruisin ' : much like a taxi , the mobile dna - testing unit will stop for street hails from passersby who want an on - the - spot dna test to confirm paternity and whatnot in 2010 , at least 382,199 so - called ' relationship tests ' were conducted in the @entity74 , although the total is likely much higher because some labs do n't submit data , according to the @entity93 , , which accredits ' relationship testing ' facilities			1
state child - support agencies make up the bulk of this demand , but experts said the number of people simply seeking answers has dramatically increased			1
' it 's just such a serious , fundamental question ... who are your children ? who are your parents ? ' ' the bigger question is what do we do with this information			0
why are we looking for it and what do we think it means ? ' said @entity115 , a lawyer who teaches at @entity116 and specializes in reproductive technology			0
' the underlying issues are obviously the quality of testing , ' @entity115 said			0
typical @entity13 customers include engaged men who want to confirm offspring from a past relationship , returning soldiers seeking reassurance they fathered newly - born children , and women inquiring about the paternity of their children			1
so far , @entity26 said , two women learned they were half - sisters , and a man whose suspicion that he might be the father of a friend 's daughter was confirmed			1
inside the facility , technicians take dna samples , which are then packaged and shipped off to an @entity62 laboratory			2
results are returned three to five business days later however , the door is open to heartbreak , especially when men discover that somebody else fathered their children			0
' if you 're really happy with the children in your life , do n't go near these things , ' @entity145 said @entity145 , a professor at @entity151			0
@entity26 's experiment is by no means groundbreaking - it 's fairly common , said experts , for dna testing labs to offer mobile collection services			1
however , his mobile facility may be the first to splash the phrase , ' @entity160 ' in bold red lettering on its side			0
health experts advise customers to only use labs accredited by @entity93 or distributors who use those labs , but there are no regulations on the outfits themselves			0
it is also not illegal to run a dna testing laboratory that is not @entity93 - certified			1
@entity174 : experts say there has been a steady increase in demand for such tests in the @entity74 , reaching close to 500,000 a year - in part to the uptick in births to unmarried women			2

facility is ensconced in a jury - rigged , blue - and - brown @entity2 that , like a taxi , caters to street hails from people who want on - the - spot dna testing
customers include engaged men , returning soldiers , and women inquiring about the paternity of their child
two women learn they are half - sisters , and a man who *suspected* he might have fathered a friend 's daughter confirms he 's the father
married father of two - make that now three - learns he fathered a child some 20 years ago with an old *flame*
rise in *popularity* of such testing facilities *attributed* by experts to uptick in number of women giving birth outside of marriage
