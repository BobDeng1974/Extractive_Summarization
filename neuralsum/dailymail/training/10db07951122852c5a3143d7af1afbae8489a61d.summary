when the talent - spotters descended on @entity2 over the weekend they were not making their way to the music festival headlined by local synth pop favourites @entity7 and the former @entity8 frontman @entity6			2
the main attraction in this small city is @entity11 , a 15 - year - old sparkling in midfield for champions @entity14 , fresh out of school and poised to break a 110 - year - old record this week as the youngest footballer to represent @entity18 at senior level			1
his team were beaten on saturday but it is easy to understand the excitement			2
@entity11 has the quick feet and technical class more readily associated with @entity25 footballers			1
video : scroll down to watch footage of @entity18 's teenage sensation in action future star : @entity11 has been called up to @entity18 's senior squad for their friendly against the @entity33 debut : the talented teen made his first appearance for @entity14 's senior team in june 2012 congratulations : the midfielder 's @entity14 team - mates applaud him during that game against @entity41 the ball sticks to him , the fans adore him , team - mates trust him and his boss @entity46 likens him to @entity47			1
‘ he has something really special , ’ purrs @entity18 manager per - @entity49 , who has called the teenager into a squad containing only home - based players for a friendly against the @entity33 on wednesday			1
if he handles this well , he will either stay in the squad for next week ’s friendly against @entity58 at @entity59 , or play for the @entity60 in a competitive game against @entity62			1
everyone agrees @entity65 football has never known anything quite like it			1
maturing : @entity11 has bulked up in the two years since making his bow for the @entity65 champions there is known interest from more than 20 big - name @entity73 clubs who have requested tickets for games at @entity14 ’s compact @entity78			1
only the best need apply			2
@entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 lead the hunt			1
@entity11 has been to @entity58 to train with @entity84 and has spent time in @entity86 with @entity80 , @entity87 and @entity88			1
@entity89 have been in touch , aware that @entity11 and his father @entity91 are lifelong fans			1
on the scoresheet : the teenager nets the winner from just inside the penalty area against @entity97 in june fast - tracked : @entity11 could make his international debut when @entity18 face @entity33 @entity99 gave @entity11 his debut before leaving @entity2 to become @entity102 manager			1
and @entity103 at @entity105 ’s academy should be in the loop because his brother @entity107 is the director of football at @entity14			1
‘ he ’s a quality player , mature in the head and does n’t get affected by all the hoopla that ’s going on around him , ’ said @entity46			2
‘ the call - up is a good thing			2
it ’s another experience for him , to go and get to know the coach there			2
he will be a future player for @entity18			1
there ’s no reason to wait			2
‘ you see these technical players involved at the big clubs and he ’s going to be one of them			2
you can pick @entity47 or you can pick @entity124			1
he is a rare talent and we ’re glad to have him			0
’ @entity11 ’s tender years are obvious when you meet him			1
he smiles , he is polite and quietly spoken , a little sheepish about the erupting clamour			0
he says he wants to focus on the ‘ small things ’ and does n’t expect to play for @entity18 when so many good and more experienced players are available			1
watch from the stands , though , and it ’s hard to tell a 15 - year - old is on the pitch			1
his shoulders are broad and his beautiful balance and awareness keep him clear of rough stuff			0
more than that , it ’s his confidence and body language			0
‘ at the beginning it was not so easy , ’ said @entity46			0
‘ he was playing on his own , but he ’s become a team player ; he ’s producing goals and scoring chances			2
he is 15 ... playing 90 minutes every week			1
’ team - mates are quick to pass to him			2
they look to him for inspiration			0
he has quick feet and tricks but does n’t showboat			0
he takes set - pieces with his left foot but @entity46 lets him play in peace			2
there is no over-protection from the boss although he did react angrily and burst on to the pitch during saturday ’s 3 - 2 home defeat by @entity159 when @entity11 was brutally body - checked			1
he glides with the ball , with traces of a young @entity162 , thanks to long practice sessions with dad @entity91 , who played more than 200 times for @entity14 as an industrious midfielder and is now assistant manager of @entity41 in the second tier			1
bhoy wonder : @entity102 boss @entity99 encourages @entity11 while in charge of @entity14 last season @entity91 designed coaching drills to improve his son ’s vision and worked with him each day from the age of five , often in the gym during the dark and cold @entity65 winter			1
‘ you can see he has a good first touch and good vision , so he never gets caught by the speed of the game , ’ said @entity91			0
‘ that ’s what ’s good about him			0
you can put him up through the levels and he can adapt			0
‘ his strength is not good but he deals with it because he does n’t get caught , he has such vision			0
i had a plan , since he was five , to train him , always with the ball , to train his vision and technique			0
it is one thing to see , but another to understand and react			0
’ world at his feet : @entity11 keeps the ball from @entity200 , a @entity65 player who was tipped for a bright future as a youngster in the late nineties while playing for @entity204 @entity11 first trained with the @entity14 seniors at 13 and appeared in a first - team training game against @entity41 at the same age			1
‘ he has not come through quickly at all , because he ’s been this good since he ’s been six , ’ said @entity46			0
‘ there are no overnight stars			0
they always work hard somewhere and he ’s worked really hard			0
‘ this is probably the 15 - year - old in the world who has trained the hardest and put in the most hours			1
he is an exceptional training talent , it ’s just unbelievable			2
everything he does is quality			0
he trains at a different level to any other player i ’ve ever seen			2
’ @entity46 himself made his top - flight debut in @entity224 for @entity225 at 16 and was the subject of interest from @entity80			1
despite a long career it did not quite unfold as planned			2
form an orderly queue : some of @entity232 's top clubs have been to @entity18 to watch @entity11 in action he had spells in @entity58 at @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237 before struggling with a gambling addiction , and is well placed to offer advice , not that he thinks it will be needed			1
‘ that ’s why we ’re all so calm , ’ said @entity46			0
‘ we do n’t stress about the media hype because we see how he is reacting			0
you have to be careful but he ’s shown we ’ve been right to play him			0
he ’s a part of the team			0
he ’s not a 15 - year - old but a player in my squad			1
‘ you never know what ’s going to happen down the road , but this player has got the talent and he is going to make it big - time			1
he wants this and he has no distractions around him			0
of course , there are always things that can happen , but we do n’t think about that			0
we just need to guide him here and there			0
’ @entity46 believes the best development programme would involve at least another season in @entity18 before @entity91 and his wife @entity262 make a family decision			1
@entity11 has a brother , @entity264 ( 17 ) , and sisters @entity265 ( 10 ) and @entity266 ( six )			1
grounded : the 15 - year - old could feature against @entity58 at @entity59 when @entity18 visit on september 3 ‘ my phone has been hot , ’ said @entity91			1
‘ since the end of may , there was just one day in july when there were no calls			0
the first one came last autumn			0
since then it ’s increased and by the time he was picked for the national team , every club knew him			1
‘ the big danger for every young kid is that they are satisfied too quickly			0
they need a hunger to im - prove			2
since he was five , he has always been focused to improve			0
at some point he has to move on to improve more , but when that will happen i do n’t know			0
‘ we have to see			0
we have feet on the ground but we know everything has taken off and there ’s so much attention on him			0
i ’ve said to all the agents and the clubs that he is too young to go alone			2
‘ i do n’t think it ’s good for any 15 - year - old boy to move abroad to a different country with a different language , different culture , to be alone sitting in a flat , coming in late on february nights , hungry			1
‘ you need a family to feel secure			0
so if that ’s going to happen soon , we move with him			0
and that ’s not easy because i have a job , working for my father - in - law ’s textile shops , and we have a family			2
