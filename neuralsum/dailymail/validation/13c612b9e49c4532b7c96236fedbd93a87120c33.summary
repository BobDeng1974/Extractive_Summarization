fans of the @entity2 boozer are concerned that pubs could become a thing of the past as thousands close each year due to spiralling production costs			1
but a new machine could help landlords feeling the pinch , because it can produce pints that cost just 35 pence ( 53 cents ) each			2
the @entity12 can make 280 pints of beer in just two hours at the touch of a button			1
@entity16 ? the @entity12 ( pictured ) may look unassuming , but it could save ailing pubs and bars by making 280 pints of beer in just two hours , costing just 35 pence ( 53 cents ) each a similar size to an industrial oven , the machine is intended for business use and will cost around £ 25,000 ( $ 38,000 )			1
the machine allows landlords to brew their own beer for a quarter of the price of buying it in from a brewery			1
the @entity29 refused to comment on how much it typically costs larger breweries to brew a pint ' for competition reasons			2
' but @entity33 , the founder of @entity34 in @entity35 told @entity36 in 2011 that it cost 90p to make a pint of beer , including 3p for malt , 2p for hops , 20p for labour and 20p for duty and 12p for transport			2
cheap and unique : the machine allows people to brew their own beer for a fraction of the price of buying it in and they can create their own unique brews to impress friends and attract customers a serious business : a similar size to an industrial oven , the machine ( pictured ) is not intended to be stored in the kitchen and costs around £ 25,000 ( $ 38,000 ) regularly drinking beer could help slow dementia , research suggests			1
scientists have discovered an ingredient in hops which they think could slow the progression of degenerative diseases such as @entity65 's and @entity66 's			2
in laboratory experiments they found that the chemical , called xanthohumol or @entity70 , could help protect brain cells from oxidative damage associated with dementia			0
the research , published in december in the @entity74 , suggested that people who regularly drink beer might be better able to ward off the progression of neurological diseases			2
taking inflation into account - but not any increases in duties - this means that a pint costs just over £ 1 to make			1
pubs brewing their own beer was an age - old tradition until the mid- 1800 ’s when the introduction of duty killed it off , but now that tradition is being revived with bars launching their own microbreweries			1
beer industry experts @entity94 and @entity96 have spent the last 10 years developing the @entity12			1
the machine is filled it with water , and then ingredients including hops are placed inside			0
it 's then switched on for two hours			0
the machine is self - cleaning and the beer is ready to drink seven days later			1
after fermentation , it can be put into casks or bottles and sold directly from a pub , which the company says guarantees its freshness and wipes out transportation costs			1
while it costs a considerable amount , the new machine is estimated to cost a quarter of price of setting up a regular £ 100,000 ( $ 152,000 ) microbrewery			1
some drinkers may be worried that beer brewed on site is not as uniform as that made at huge breweries , but @entity94 , director of @entity122 , told @entity123 that the beer is controlled by computer software			0
' for the novice brewer we supply ready made ingredients to enable them to ensure repeatability			0
' unlike large scale breweries the measurements are far more accurate , both for ingredients and for the quantity of water			0
' the system is sealed and so is free from risk of infection			0
brews are fresh and so no additives , colouring agents or preservatives are required			0
beer industry experts @entity94 and @entity96 have spent the last 10 years developing the @entity143 have to fill it with water , add ingredients including hops and switch it on for two hours			0
instructions and readings such as the temperature are shown on an attached tablet ( pictured ) inventor mr @entity94 , 67 , from @entity153 , @entity154 , said : ‘ @entity156 ale is the story of the moment and major brands are being shunned by consumers who now seek interesting and really good beers with local provenance			0
‘ pubs can benefit enormously from this by brewing their own beer and that ’s where @entity12 comes in			1
’ landlords can create unique beers to attract customers			0
‘ and because they brew the beer onsite , pubs can guarantee it is fresh and there is no need for chemicals or preservatives or other additives that the public have no idea about , ’ mr @entity94 said			2
the machine has just gone on general sale in the @entity2 and will launch in the @entity182 in ' the next couple of months ' .			0

@entity12 is **designed** for bars and pubs , not the home
machine costs £ 25,000 ( $ 38,000 ) and makes beer at the touch of a button
it 's **designed** to save *struggling* bar and pub owners time and money
machine cleans itself when it 's finished and the beer is ready in seven days
