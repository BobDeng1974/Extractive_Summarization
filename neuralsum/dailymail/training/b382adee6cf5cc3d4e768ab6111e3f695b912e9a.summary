by @entity0 @entity2 's first taste of @entity4 football ought to serve as a blow to the solar plexus of anyone who doubts his capacity to make the quantum leap from tiny @entity10 to @entity11			1
the autumn of 2011 paired the @entity14 minnows with no less a side than @entity16 in the third qualifying round of the @entity18			1
for those observers unaware of the near miracle he was overseeing in the small city of @entity24 , the tie had the whiff of a turkey shoot about it			2
a squad boasting the likes of @entity30 and @entity31 would surely get the job done with something to spare			2
@entity34 went the theory anyway			2
a 2 - 1 win the first step , it transpired , on a road that would see them lift the trophy the following spring			2
@entity49 succumbed in the end by the same score on home soil a week later but both they and their young manager had more than made their mark			2
so much for the @entity56 eating them up and spitting them out			2
@entity2 ’s men played on the front foot from the off in @entity42 , leaving the @entity63 giants wondering exactly what had his them			1
for their young manager , it was a night when an appetite for such jousts became insatiable			2
‘ that was my biggest moment in football ever , ’ @entity2 recalled on monday			1
‘ we played a fantastic game			2
i have played in @entity72 , but for me that international stage against a good team when we played well gave me a very good feeling			2
‘ it was 59 per cent to 41 per cent ( possession for @entity16 )			1
it was possible because we did it			2
we played well and had a big chance to make it 2 - 2			2
at home we had them under pressure – but the difference is how effective you are			2
all smiles : @entity2 and his assistant manager @entity87 ( right ) are preparing for their first season at @entity37 ‘ they had @entity31 in their side and although he did n’t want to play after the @entity93 , they needed him because they did not want to miss out			1
‘ you see the skills they have when taking chances – that ’s the difference between teams at that level			2
‘ i hope that i will get many feelings like that at @entity37 – that ’s why i came here			1
‘ i looked at the @entity106 game and , although @entity37 did n’t win , the atmosphere was unbelievable			1
that ’s why you are in football			0
‘ you want to win trophies , but the moments at matches when you experience good things with fans and players is also special			0
’ @entity2 ’s raison d’etre is currently to give himself and his new club as much chance of tasting such occasions this season as is humanly possible			1
commendably , the @entity14 did n’t try to paint @entity122 as something they were n’t @entity126 ’s inaugural opponents in this year ’s quest for the group stage will be more than competent			1
@entity2 would expect nothing less from a side sitting fourth in their league after nine matches			1
the reigning @entity134 champions will be match fit , too , and given their country ’s progression to the @entity139 play - offs last year , unlikely to be gripped by an inferiority complex , either			1
so close : @entity2 came close to knocking @entity42 side @entity16 out of the @entity18 while at @entity141 nonetheless , while not a gentle trip to the @entity145 valleys , it ’s hardly a tie to have the @entity148 champions hiding under the bed			1
‘ that ’s true – @entity37 is expected to win , ’ @entity2 added			1
‘ @entity134 football has improved a lot in the last few years			1
it is unbelievable what @entity134 has achieved in football – and handball , as well			1
‘ that ’s the two sports they are good at			0
almost everyone gets involved at an early age			0
‘ i think in many ways @entity134 football is ahead of many other countries			1
‘ but i think their league is much lower quality than the national team because so many players go abroad			0
the most successful club in @entity134 football			1
they won the last of their 13 titles last year			0
they ’ve been managed by former @entity134 international @entity176 since 2010			1
where do they play ? the kr - vollur			1
with a capacity of 2,781 , it ’s not one of @entity184 ’s more intimidating arenas			1
it also boasts a grass park , which is one less thing for @entity37 to worry about			1
what can @entity37 expect ? an uncompromising and athletic outfit			1
given that @entity134 football adheres to a summer season , they ’ll also be match fit			1
after nine games , they sit fourth in the table — three points off the pace			0
anyone we would know ? @entity199 was on @entity37 ’s books between 2005 and 2008 , although he did n’t play a game			1
former @entity203 man @entity202 plays up front for them			0
@entity207 ’s @entity206 recent european history ? this will be their sixth successive campaign			0
last year , in the @entity18 they saw off @entity213 ’s @entity212 3 - 0 , before losing 6 - 2 on aggregate to @entity215			1
a decent draw then ? could be better , could be worse			0
the dream trip to @entity145 or @entity213 to face @entity218 or @entity219 did n’t materialise			0
but neither did the horrific prospect of facing @entity221			1
‘ they are hard - working players with a good team spirit			0
they will be well organised , too			0
we should be a better team than them over two matches			0
now it ’s all about doing everything right in pre-season to get the squad as best physically and mentally prepared for these games			0
‘ we will try to do everything right in @entity232 to build up the physical shape of the players as quickly as possible and in the best way , without getting injuries			0
then we will be very focused on this game			0
’ @entity37 fly to @entity232 for a two - week training camp this sunday but , if his schedule allows , @entity2 intends to watch the @entity134 side in action			1
while familiarising himself with the @entity39 players is top of his agenda , their coach @entity176 needs no introduction from his time playing in @entity14			2
‘ i played against him many times , he was a very good player , ’ @entity2 added			1
‘ i do n’t remember much about the games against him but he was a good player			0
he was a central midfielder and went on to @entity252 afterwards			0
i know he was a big star with @entity253			0
’ @entity2 has spent the past week growing accustomed to his new surroundings but the relative peace he ’s enjoyed will this morning be shattered by the return of the bulk of his squad for pre-season training			1
he intends it to be a convivial and informative affair			0
‘ it ’s important to get settled and tell players how things are going to be , ’ he said			0
‘ that ’s what we will do first and then we can start working			0
‘ then the exercises will not be high intensity because we have been away a long time			0
we will get to know each other and take it from there			0
‘ i do n’t think we will change much – but some things will be different			0
maybe we will meet up a little bit earlier so we can plan things before training			0
settling in : @entity2 has been getting used to his new surroundings in @entity278 since being named @entity37 boss ‘ we will talk about what the training will consist of so we all have an idea of what we will focus on on the pitch			1
‘ everything is about training			0
you train as you play			2
if you have good preparations then the players will develop			0
the staff will work hard to make it as short and simple as possible so players can use energy on the pitch			0
‘ the players have to feel that i can trust them and they must also have fun			0
if they do that then things will happen – i know it			0

@entity37 will play @entity134 side @entity122 in the @entity40 second qualifying round
@entity2 came close to knocking @entity16 out of the @entity18 while at @entity141
the recently appointed @entity303 boss is relishing the prospect of playing in @entity184 's elite club *competition*
