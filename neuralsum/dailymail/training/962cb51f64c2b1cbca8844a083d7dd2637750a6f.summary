by @entity0 published : 08:00 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 19:23 est , 19 september 2012 there is usually just one party that benefits from divorce proceedings : the lawyer			0
but , it seems , they do n’t always learn from the bad experiences of others			0
in an extraordinary case , two wealthy solicitors spent five years and virtually all their money battling over the terms of their acrimonious split			0
battle : @entity15 ( left ) and @entity16 were left with just over £ 90,000 between them , after years of acrimonious legal disputes over money and their three children @entity21 : the luxury £ 3.2 million mansion the pair used to share in @entity25 ( pictured )			1
mrs @entity16 was awarded two thirds of the funds raised from its sale in a previous hearing despite both being practising lawyers , @entity16 , 47 , and her ex-husband @entity15 , 52 , ‘ spent almost all their assets in litigation ’ during the lengthy court battle			2
a judge who had previously presided over their case criticised them for ‘ wrecking the ship of their marriage , then turning their attention to the lifeboats ’			1
and yesterday , as they returned to the courts yet again , a different judge said they had ‘ tragically ’ squandered their fortune and had little more than £ 90,000 left between them			2
the @entity53 , who have three children together and were married for ten years , lived in a £ 3.2million seven - bedroom home set in half - an - acre in @entity56 until their split in 2008			1
following the divorce , they spent almost £ 900,000 in a court battle to determine maintenance payments and the division of their assets			1
mrs @entity16 was awarded two thirds of the funds raised by the sale of the matrimonial home in @entity25 - upon - @entity66 , and her husband a third by a judge in 2008			1
but the proceeds of the multi-million pound sale – after it is believed a hefty mortgage was repaid – were so depleted by a ‘ debt of costs ’ and other factors , that mrs @entity16 received just £ 94,500			2
despite mr @entity15 earning more than £ 485,000 a year as a partner in a law firm specialising in aerospace litigation and insurance , he was left with ‘ net debts ’ following the court hearings			1
yesterday , the couple returned to court before top family judge , @entity85 , to contest the level of maintenance payments mr @entity15 was ordered to pay to his ex-wife			1
the judge , sitting at @entity56 ’s @entity89 , said that the couple ’s expenditure was a ‘ tragedy ’ for the family ’s finances			2
he added that judge @entity96 , who had previously presided over the case in the @entity98 ’s @entity98 , had criticised the couple in his judgment last year			2
criticised : the judge criticised the pair for ' wrecking the ship of their marriage ' with their expensive legal battle			1
the pair lost almost all of their assets and sold their former home , ( pictured ) during their fight in the courts he said that the judge had told them : ‘ they wrecked the ship then turned their attention to the lifeboats			1
‘ by 2008 they had spent over £ 879,000 on legal costs and contested proceedings			0
@entity122 proceedings had cost about £ 545,000			0
the financial proceedings cost over £ 303,000 and @entity127 applications cost another £ 32,000			0
the disputes and costs have gone on			0
‘ the ship of marriage may founder , but this couple have driven theirs full - tilt on to the rocks			2
’ mrs @entity16 ’s barrister , @entity136 , argued that mrs @entity16 should receive more maintenance because her husband ’s pay rises since 2008 had been ‘ double the average annual wage of a man living in the @entity142 ’			0
mrs @entity16 , who receives £ 48,000 - a - year , should have the yearly payments increased to between £ 66,000 and £ 88,000 as she had put her career on hold to raise the couple ’s children , he said			1
rejecting the plea , @entity85 said the impact of the costs in the case were ‘ a catastrophe for this family ’			0
he said mr @entity15 was already responsible for paying the school fees for the couple ’s three children who are all being privately educated at a cost of £ 36,000 - a - year			1
‘ there is no prospect of an appeal succeeding were the matter to be given permission , ’ the judge concluded			0
both parties attended the hearing , although mr @entity15 was not represented			0
mrs @entity16 declined to comment afterwards .			0
