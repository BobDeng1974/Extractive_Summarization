by @entity0 published : 04:49 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 05:11 est , 2 december 2013 she has a crippling condition that is weakening her heart , causing her muscles to seize up and has very recently confined her to a wheelchair			1
but through her love of music - and with little help from her friends - @entity10 is determined not to let her progressively debilitating illness stop her playing in her beloved marching band			1
the 14 - year - old flute player , who goes to @entity14 in @entity15 , has a dreadful birth gene that was eventually diagnosed as @entity17			1
it 's muscular dystrophy , scoliosis , heart weakness , circulation problems , diabetes and more rolled into one tragic syndrome			1
brave : wheelchair - bound flute player @entity10 ( centre ) takes part in a performance with her high school marching band despite suffering a crippling illness that causes heart problems and her muscles to seize up helping hands : @entity10 is pushed around by the band director 's daughter @entity34 who has learned the entire routine to ensure everything goes smoothly during the performance when she reached high school this year , @entity10 and her band director @entity39 vowed not to let @entity41 's stop her from joining the band			1
with the rapid and intricate movements of a high school marching band - from twisting tubas to dipping drums to majorettes - it 's no place for a wheelchair to be rolling around			1
but for @entity34 , @entity10 's spot in the 184 - member band started long before he ever met her			1
several years ago , he watched a news program about a college marching band			1
in it , was a wheelchair - bound student whose father learned the march routine so he could push his son on the field			1
' i choked up when i saw it , ' said @entity34			2
' i put myself in that position and wondered " how would i do it ? " ' i thought : i would like to make that happen some day			2
' against the odds : the 14 - year - old has @entity17 which causes muscular dystrophy , scoliosis , heart weakness and diabetes , but is determined to continue doing the things she loves having fun : @entity10 ( right ) with fellow band member @entity74 during a football game in @entity76 , @entity15 that ' some day ' came last spring			1
@entity10 has been in a school band since fifth grade and she had dreams of being in the @entity14 band			1
walking has always been a challenge with her disease , but halfway through eighth grade last year , the curvature in her spine had progressed that she needed rods inserted in her back to straighten her			1
it made her walking even more unstable and a wheelchair safer			1
@entity10 's father , @entity91 , said : ' mr @entity39 already knew of @entity10 and her interest in band			1
he got a surprise with the wheelchair , though			1
' @entity10 's mother , @entity96 , did not want @entity10 's feelings hurt			1
' she really wanted to be part of band , but i did n't want to get her hopes up , ' @entity96 said			1
' the last thing i wanted to do was have her sign up and learn that she had to sit on sidelines			0
' @entity34 did n't want that either			0
' we have the same expectations for all our kids , ' @entity34 said			0
' never are all kids at the same level of music or marching			0
we work with all of them			0
' for @entity10 to play her flute in the @entity76 band , an adult would need to learn all the drills and push @entity10 around the field at every event			1
@entity91 's and @entity96 's work schedules would not permit them			1
@entity34 needed someone to volunteer - but he got two			0
@entity120 , band booster club president and mother to band members @entity123 , a senior , and @entity125 , a freshman , said : ' it brought back memories of my band life at @entity132 , ' this summer , she added the role of @entity10 's away game partner			1
@entity10 's home games were handled by @entity34 's daughter , @entity136 , who came home from @entity138 to help out			1
it was an easy fit for @entity120 and @entity136 as they were set to be at the critical band camp anyway to assist @entity34			1
the three of them got started together at august camp in @entity145 , @entity146 , and @entity147 tested them from the start			0
progressive illness : @entity10 ( pictured with school friends ) developed a curvature in her spine halfway through eighth grade last year which meant she needed rods inserted in her back to straighten her rain - soaked fields , mud , slogging - it was a tough introduction to their new partnership			1
' we started with the worst conditions , so it could only get better , ' @entity136 said			0
@entity10 laughs at those first days			0
' i almost fell out of my chair twice , ' said the 14 - year - old who , with her brother @entity167 , 12 , splits living time between her parents ' @entity76 homes			0
@entity120 recalls one tipping moment			0
' i turned too fast and was not used to the chair yet and i hear " mrs @entity120 - i 'm tipping " , ' @entity120 said with a laugh			0
both @entity120 and @entity136 said if you think their job was tough , try being @entity10 and playing the flute while all this was going on			1
friend @entity178 ' she did the best to play flute while we bumped around , ' said @entity136			0
' it was just nice to see her happy and enjoying the band			1
' already solved for the @entity76 band next year is who will handle @entity10			1
@entity120 and @entity136 are already set to go			0
and @entity10 no doubt expects to be there			0
@entity10 had a normal kid life - doing ballet and playing baseball			1
he parents later noticed small things , but they were dismissible			0
@entity41 's itself is often not diagnosed until teen years or later , said @entity96			2
that all changed in the summer before fifth grade as the disease took control			0
' it affects everyone differently , ' said @entity91			0
the impact of the diagnosis came to the family in stages			0
' first they told us the ataxia part -- a tightening of the muscles , and i thought , ' oh well , no biggie - therapy and stretching , ' said @entity96			2
' @entity41 's is a whole different ball game			2
' of all the harsh realities of @entity41 's , one reality strikes just a bit harder - it is genetic			1
@entity10 's brother @entity167 has it as well			2
' i was in @entity217 for work , ' said @entity96 when she got the news			0
she and @entity91 ended their marriage long before @entity41 's entered their lives			2
' i was away from the kids , so they could not see me break down			0
it was so hard to grasp			0
i did not function for days			0
' @entity10 talks with @entity14 band director @entity39 who was inspired to help her after hearing about a wheelchair - bound student whose father learned the march routine so he could push his son @entity96 struggled with guilt			1
' it 's a horrible feeling knowing it 's a genetic disease			1
as a parent - i know that it came from me , ' she said			0
although it affects 1 in 50,000 @entity238 , how it happens seems almost a tragic fluke			0
the gene can exist and be defective in any one person and there are no problems			0
that 's @entity91 and @entity96			2
when those two people who have that defective gene have children , there 's a 25 per cent chance their offspring will have the disease			2
that 's @entity10 and @entity167			2
@entity17 is a genetic condition that around 1 in 50,000 people in the @entity238			1
the illness affects everyone differently , but symptoms range from loss of co-ordination in the arms and legs , fatigue , muscle loss and heart disease			2
it can also cause aggressive scoliosis - a curvature of the spine - and diabetes			1
the defective gene can exist in any one person and there are no problems			0
but when two people who have that defective gene have children , there 's a 25 per cent chance their offspring will have the disease			2
there is currently no cure , but some of the symptoms can be managed			0
@entity167 's determined that he wo n't be in a wheelchair , said @entity91			1
and they notice that physical effects on him are less than @entity285 's			2
but @entity167 required glasses at an earlier age - the disease affected his eye muscles			2
around @entity10 is a core of friends who 've she 's known since kindergarten : @entity293 , @entity294 and @entity295			2
they form a tight ring around her - aiding with all her needs as needed at the dorm , on the bus and more			0
' her friends are so welcoming to her			0
they 're the most loving people , ' @entity136 said			0
and occasionally in life , you bump into new folks like @entity34 , @entity136 and @entity120 , willing to figure out new things			0
' i was floored at how much they 've invested in her , ' said @entity96 , who was watching video posts throughout the week of band camp			2
' this was a huge deal for @entity10			0
' @entity136 was nervous , she admits			0
she asked her father what if this does n't work			0
' he said " we 're just going to make it work " , ' she said			0
' i love that he 's not afraid to take risks that others would push away			1
' @entity34 said being in band is about adjustments and acceptance , and this was just the same - even though that tv segment was his only evidence of seeing it work in his 25 years			2
' none of us looked at it as " it 's a great thing we 're doing			2
" ' it was simply : this is what the band needs - let 's do it			1
