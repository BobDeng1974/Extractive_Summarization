' i feel that has been taken away from me			2
' his lawyer @entity28 said mr @entity6 's case has ' significant ramifications for the @entity33 community and is a wake - up call to employers in terms of employment practices			1
' @entity20 would not comment but referred questions to his lawyer , @entity39 mr @entity39 said he could not discuss details of the case since it was in litigation but said mr @entity6 's contract was terminated legally			1
' we deny all the allegations , ' he said			0
mr @entity6 says he started being treated like a pariah after a parent became suspicious of his long hair and fancy nails and went to school bosses with her concerns in august last year former students of @entity54 have launched an online petition that describes mr @entity6 as a beloved and well - respected teacher and urges the school to apologise			1
@entity59 , who started the petition on @entity61 , said mr @entity6 always had a ' feminine edge , ' though it was nothing shocking			1

' it just did n't seem to matter , and it never affected his teaching style or his opinions			0
he never imposed anything on us			0
' @entity7 in @entity72 , @entity8 ,			0
where the teacher worked for 32 years she told @entity26 mr @entity6 's sex education class called @entity76 and @entity77 was one of her favorites during her four years at @entity54			1

i feel that has been taken away from me			0
' mr @entity6 ' i still laugh to this day when i remember it			2

the teacher wanted to remain at the school and said he would ' tone down ' his appearance by removing his earrings and @entity118 manicure			2
