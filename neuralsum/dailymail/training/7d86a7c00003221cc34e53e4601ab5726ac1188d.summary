by @entity0 published : 13:29 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 15:23 est , 7 march 2013 @entity2 has unveiled a major redesign of its @entity4 - and says it wants it to look more like a personalised magazine or newspaper			1
@entity7 said the radical overhaul reflects the huge amount of pictures being shared on the social networking site - which he revealed is now over 50 % of the items shared			1
however , it was also revealed that along with bigger pictures , the advertisments @entity2 's billion users will see will get bigger			1
' @entity4 is one of the most important services we build , and we want to to give people around the world the best personalised news			0
' @entity7 had singled out the feature as in need of a makeover as recently as january , when the company introduced ' graph search ' to address inadequacies in allowing users to trawl for information across the world 's largest social network			1
@entity63 , the designer of the new newsfeed , admitted that as pictures got bigger for users , so would ads. ' integrating ads is n't something we really thought about , ' he claimed			2
' this redesign is about letting the content shine - whether that 's from a musician , sponsored or from friends			1
' the adverts will be bigger and richer , along with everything else			0
' @entity78 , @entity2 's director of design , said the firm was ' putting these pictures front and centre - they are more immersive			1
' she said the new designed was similar to a magazine table of contents			2
' the new newsfeed is richer , simpler more beautiful newsfeed or desktop and mobile , ' she said			0
the firm also revealed the new look will make the mobile phone and tablet apps look more like the desktop site			1
the changes are @entity2 's also attempt to learn more about its users and keep people coming back so the company can sell more advertising			1
@entity63 , the designer of the new newsfeed , told @entity99 he has been working on the project for a year			0
' when we began we were n't sure what we would be doing , ' he admitted			0
' one early study used cut up paper to get people to rearrange their newsfeed			0
' we found people really want to be able to see just posts from friends , and see photos ' we decided if we 're going to be showing photos , we need to have a design that gave them centre stage			0
' the new look was inspired by the firm 's mobile apps			0
' it starts to feel like mobile and desktop are made of the same material , we do n't want people to have to learn things twice			0
' @entity124 also said the firm still treated @entity2 as a third party app - even thought the firm owns the retro picture service			1
' @entity130 remain an independent app - even thought they are in house it 's been really interesting to have them here , to make sure third party apps look good - they are guinea pigs in many ways			2
the team behind the redesign was tiny - with @entity124 and one other designer working with engineers			0
' the design team was small - me and one other designer , in fact			0
' it 's been a big undertaking , it 's a high profile page - and we 've had a lot of help			1
' we 've been bunkered down in a room working closely with engineers - 15 of us in a conference room turned war room			0
' ' @entity158 was the mascot - black and white like a newspaper , so somewhere along the way we adopted it - we all call each other pandas			0
' new music pages for bands were also revealed , with this one showing the new design for @entity168 @entity2 's new album page shows more photos than the current version @entity2 boss @entity7 unveiled the new look at the firm 's @entity174 hq the event comes a month after a @entity178 study reported that many @entity2 users take a break from the site for weeks at a time			1
the report , from the @entity178 's internet and @entity185 , found that some 61 percent of @entity2 users had taken a hiatus for reasons that range from boredom to too much irrelevant information to @entity191			1
overall , though , @entity2 's user base is growing , especially on mobile devices			1
at last count it had 1.06 billion active monthly accounts			0
@entity7 said the redesign was triggered by a huge increase in pictures being shared on the service , with 50 % of items now being shared photos @entity2 's new design will also make the site look the same on both desktop and mobile computers the number of people who access @entity2 daily is also on the rise			1
that said , even the company has acknowledged that some of its users , especially the younger ones , are migrating to substitutes , but so far this has not meant an overall decline in user numbers			0
the world 's largest social network is moving to regain @entity221 's confidence after a botched ipo last year , addressing concerns about its long - term prospects - many of which center on an industry - wide shift toward the use of mobile devices			2
@entity2 shares , which are still more than a quarter off their ipo price of $ 38 , were up 2 percent at $ 27.99 on thursday afternoon on the @entity234			2
@entity2 and @entity235 , which both got their start on desktop computers , are now managing a transition of their products onto smartphones and tablets , which typically yield less revenue than on @entity244 the two internet mainstays are also waging a war for revenue in mobile advertising - a market that is still small compared with the traditional desktop but that is growing exponentially			2
in terms of overall mobile advertising , @entity235 commanded a 53.5 percent share in 2012 , aided by its dominance in search - based ads. @entity2 had just 8.4 percent , a distant runner - up , according to estimates from research house @entity257			2
' for example , we believe that some of our users have reduced their engagement with @entity2 in favor of increased engagement with other products and services such as @entity130 , ' the company said last month in the " risk factors " of its annual report			2
' in the event that our users increasingly engage with other products and services , we may experience a decline in user engagement and our business could be harmed			0
' @entity2 's old design ( left ) compared to the new look revealed today ( right ) new music pages will allow people to see which of their friends like the same artist , while a a feed will show posts about the music you listen to			1
