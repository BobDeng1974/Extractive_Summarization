@entity0 should n't expect to be recognized by many people during his trip to @entity3 this week - apart from those who love his movies			1
after the vice president 's visit shut down roads in the city on monday , late night show host @entity6 asked 11 people on @entity13 who he was - and none guessed correctly			1
a few even suggested he was a movie star , while another guessed he was in a terror group			0
only the 12th person was vaguely close , calling @entity0 ' the assistant president '			0
' i mean , i know he 's the vice president but i wonder how many people even care if he 's here ... we asked @entity35 a very simple question : who is @entity0 ? ' one girl gave a wise guess that he might be ' a man ' , while a couple of people were sure they 'd seen him in movies that they could n't name			1
one man , who was wearing a cloth on his head decorated with marijuana leaves , admitted he was under the influence and struggling to recall who @entity0 was - before suddenly remembering he was ' that old dude ' from @entity50 - a movie about a weed dealer			0
confused : two passersby struggle to remember who @entity0 is as he arrives in @entity3 on monday no idea : some people guessed that he was the governor - or perhaps a movie star or a terror group not sure : this man told @entity61 's camera crew that @entity0 was a @entity63 set to run for president fan : when presented with a picture of @entity0 , one man says he 's ' that old dude ' from @entity50 another passerby guessed ' a terror group ' while another assumed he was a @entity63 , and yet more thought he was the governor - with one suggesting he was a @entity70			1
@entity0 arrived in @entity3 on monday afternoon to attend two @entity72 fundraisers - one for @entity74 candidate @entity73 and another for the @entity75			2
on tuesday , he is expected to attend a roundtable discussion on minimum wage with @entity3 mayor @entity78			2
his trip comes three days before president @entity80 is scheduled to visit the city to attend a fundraiser hosted by @entity83			0
not happy : @entity0 , pictured in @entity84 on monday , was in town to attend @entity75 fundraisers			0
