' ( @entity17 ) brought in reinforcements ... and attacked hard , ' @entity51 said			2
' but thanks to air strikes and ( the @entity26 fighters ' ) response , they did not make any progress			1

but commanders have repeatedly said that the main priority remains the battle against @entity17 in neighbouring @entity5 , where the jihadists swept through much of the @entity112 and west of @entity114 in june			2
the minority community 's grievances against the @entity118 led - government were a major factor in the lightning advance and @entity18 has been piling pressure on @entity114 to form an inclusive government capable of mounting a fightback			0
commanders have repeatedly said that the main priority remains the battle against @entity17 in neighbouring @entity5 - not @entity2 , where @entity2 soldiers are seen above - where the jihadists swept through much of the @entity129 @entity128 heartland north and west of @entity114 in june yesterday , the remaining posts in a new government line - up were finally approved by parliament , including a @entity129 as defence minister and a @entity118 as interior minister			2

@entity18 has acknowledged that @entity145 has an important role to play in the battle against @entity17 , although it has kept the main @entity118 power out of the coalition it has forged against the jihadists for fear of alienating @entity129			0
@entity143 's talks in @entity157 are part of his bid ' to unite the efforts of the region and the world to help @entity5 in its war against the terrorist group , ' his office said			0
although it has not been part of the @entity8 - led coalition , @entity145 has been a key backer of @entity143 's government in its efforts to hold back the jihadist advance			1
according to a senior @entity5 @entity26 official , it has deployed troops on the @entity5 side of the border in the @entity176 area northeast of @entity114			0
