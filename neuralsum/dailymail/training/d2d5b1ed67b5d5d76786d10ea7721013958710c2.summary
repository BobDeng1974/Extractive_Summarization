by @entity1 reporter published : 23:37 est , 19 october 2013 updated : 23:40 est , 19 october 2013 a second giant rare serpentine oarfish has washed up on a @entity5 beach just days after the first creature surfaced from the depths			2
the silvery deep - sea monster washed ashore along the coast of @entity10 on friday afternoon measuring 13 and - a - half feet long			1
the discovery came just days after an 18 - foot dead oarfish was found in the waters off @entity14			1
speculation is rife over whether the sightings prelude an earthquake close - up : the head of the 18 - foot - long oarfish that was found in the waters of @entity26 on @entity14 , @entity5 on october 13 ‘ it ’s not the typical fish you see on shore , ’ said @entity10 police officer @entity27 , adding the oarfish weighed over 200 pounds			1
@entity10 police contacted @entity34 , the @entity35 and the @entity36			0
@entity37 of @entity38 came and measured the fish before she took possession of it for research , @entity27 told @entity43			2
last week , on october 13 , @entity44 , a science instructor for the @entity45 , @entity45 , was snorkeling off @entity26 when she discovered the body of the creature on a seabed			0
the fish was far too big for @entity50 to carry alone ; it took 15 people to bring the beast to shore			2
incredible : an 18 - foot - long oarfish found dead in the water off @entity14 near @entity58 , @entity5 ' we 've never seen a fish this big , ' said @entity61 , senior captain of the @entity62 , @entity64 's sail training ship			1
' the last oarfish we saw was three feet long			1
' but these two massive fish are puny by oarfish standards , according to the @entity36			0
the oarfish is the largest bony fish in the sea and can grow over 50 feet in length			1
because oarfish dive more than 3,000 feet deep , sightings of the creatures are rare and they are largely unstudied , according to @entity64			0
the obscure fish apparently died of natural causes			0
tissue samples and video footage were sent to be studied by biologists at the @entity79 , @entity79			0
science instructor @entity50 spotted something shimmering about 30 feet deep while snorkeling during a staff trip in @entity26 , about two dozen miles from the mainland			0
a mystery : oarfish dive more than 3,000 feet deep , sightings of the creatures are rare and they are largely unstudied an illustration of @entity88 's @entity85 , circa 1850 , the giant fish that inspired tales of sea serpents			1
the 18 - foot oarfish found off @entity5 took 16 people to haul ashore ' she was snorkeling and sees this giant fish at the bottom of the ocean , ' @entity61 told @entity97			1
' she swims down and grabs it by the tail and swims it to the beach			0
there were people sprinting to go and see this fish			0
' @entity61 said @entity50 dragged the fish ashore because she said , ' nobody will believe me '			2
after she pulled the carcass by the tail for more than 75 feet , staffers waded in and helped her bring it to shore			1
the carcass was on display tuesday for 5th , 6th , and 7th grade students studying at @entity64			0
the oarfish , which can grow to more than 50 feet , is a deep - water pelagic fish — the longest bony fish in the world , according to @entity64			1
they are likely responsible for the supposed sea serpent legends throughout history			2
the giant oarfish was first discovered in 1772 by @entity126 biologist @entity125			0
its formal scientific title is @entity129 , but the fish is also known as king of the herring , @entity134 oarfish , streamer fish and ribbon - fish			2
the longest recorded specimen clocked in at 26 feet , however , the species is believed to grow as long as 50 feet and weigh as much as 600 pounds			1
like the equally mysterious giant squid , the oarfish would go on to enchant fisherman and sailors and inspire stories of sea monsters			2
the fish lives at extreme ocean depths , between 656 feet ( 0.2 kilometers ) and 3,280 feet ( 1 kilometer ) deep			0
in 1996 , a group of @entity148 found a 23 - foot long oarfish off @entity150 , near @entity34 , @entity5			1
in 1996 , @entity148 pulled ashore this 23 - foot oarfish that was found off the coast near @entity34 , @entity5 the @entity14 fish is currently on ice while the fate of the carcass is decided			1
' i am pushing to bury it and wait for it to be naturally cleaned so that we can then take the skeleton and articulate it and have it on display , ' said @entity61			0
' that is what i hope will happen .			0

the huge oarfish was found on friday and measured almost 14 feet
it comes a week after an 18 - foot specimen was found in waters off @entity14 near @entity58
it needed 16 people to drag it ashore
*female* snorkeler dragged giant carcass by the tail for more than 75 feet to prove to *co-workers* she had seen legendary fish floating *underwater*
the *ancient* ' sea serpent ' legend can grow to 50 feet long and weigh 600 pounds
