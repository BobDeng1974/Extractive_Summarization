offered an improbable second chance in the @entity2 , @entity0 are on the verge of taking it			1
a composed , tactically astute performance against the champions of @entity7 in the @entity8 leaves @entity10 's team 90 minutes from the group stages for a third successive year			1
short of signing @entity13 it 's hard to recall a greater act of naked escapology than this			2
the @entity19 champions are not through yet			0
neither should they expect a good luck postcard from @entity23 in the coming days			0
yet , on a night when they dominated a very ordinary @entity25 team for long spells they could – should – have emerged with a first leg victory			2
subs : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62			0
@entity0 : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity43 , @entity68 , @entity32 , @entity69 , @entity44 , @entity70 ( @entity71 81 )			1

referee : @entity80 ( @entity81 ) such was the contrast with the 4 - 1 defeat to @entity85 which left @entity10 's team staring down the barrel of fiscal gun , however , there were few of a mind to quibble on wednesday night			1
there were some similarities with the @entity85 game			0
once again @entity0 made a terrific start			1
once again , they conceded a quick equaliser			0
but this time there was no collapse			0
@entity0 have good reason to believe they will finish the job at @entity99 before a large crowd now			1
for the third successive away game in @entity102 @entity32 , the 20 - year - old who spent last season on loan at @entity105 , scored an invaluable goal			1
like @entity43 , @entity63 and a raft of others in @entity0 colours he had a fine game and is making a habit of it , showing excellent composure and decision making in key areas			1
it took him eight minutes to score the goal which ultimately proved crucial to @entity0 in @entity23			1
here it took just five			0
@entity43 , who had an industrious night in @entity0 's midfield , sprung the @entity25 back line with a lofted pass to an onside and in space @entity44			1
the @entity124 had work to do yet			0
he rode the first challenge then steered an angled shot towards goal			0
home keeper @entity37 blocked with his legs , but @entity32 is showing a pleasing habit of being the right man in the right place			1
the youngster slotted the ball into the net for 1 - 0			2
the gnashing of teeth on the streets of @entity23 was almost audible above the silence of the home supporters			0
there was no sign of panic from @entity0			1
the possession stats were overwhelming in their favour			0
@entity25 generously stood off the team in green and white and allowed them to play			0
all square : @entity25 's @entity54 ( second from right ) tucks the ball beyond @entity0 goalkeeper @entity63 to get his side back on level terms get in ! @entity25 midfielder @entity54 gestures to the home fans after scoring in the 14th minute at the @entity8 yet cold hard experience has already shown this season that nothing is simple for @entity157 's champions			1
after shipping a leveller in three minutes in @entity160 they lasted a whole eight here			2
yet the goal they lost – once again – was pitiful			0
@entity10 started 19 - year - old on loan @entity163 defender @entity65 beside @entity165 and threw @entity69 in beside @entity68 as a second holding midfielder			2
last season 's top scorer @entity76 was sacrificed to make @entity0 stiffer and sterner in defence and that decision was justified by a return to form from @entity69			1
the @entity171 was solid here			0
yet in 14 minutes the home team simply passed the ball through a porous backline			2
@entity65 's inexperience showed as he was caught wrong side of his man , while @entity64 might also have done better			1
whoever cops the blame eventually , left winger @entity181 slotted the through ball calmly past @entity63 for 1 - 1			2
it was @entity25 's first chance			2
it was natural , then , to fear for @entity0			1
there was a déjà vu to much of this			0
mercifully , it was misplaced			0
in contrast with warsaw @entity10 's team did n't panic			2
they made it to half - time at 1 - 1 quite comfortably and were desperately unlucky not to be 2 - 1 – maybe even 3 - 1 ahead			2
oddly willing to stand off and allow their visitors to play , @entity25 conceded a raft of first half corners			0
one of them , in 20 minutes , almost ended in a goal when @entity43 's deep , probing effort to the back post was headed back across goal by captain @entity68			1
@entity204 headed off the line			0
there was an astonishing let - off for @entity25 just after the half hour mark			2
another @entity0 corner , this time from @entity70 on the other side picked out @entity165 in front of goal and his header could hardly have been any better			1
it was bulleting into the net until , freakishly , it struck @entity0 teammate @entity43 on the goalline and stayed out			1
under pressure : @entity0 defender @entity218 ( back ) tussles with @entity25 striker @entity56 ( front ) as he prepares to receive a pass so close : @entity0 almost take the lead but @entity165 can @entity66 's ( right ) header hits his team - mate @entity43 and bounces back into play battle : @entity225 ( left ) and @entity32 ( right ) both attempt to get control of the ball during the opening period still there was no reason for @entity0 to despair			1
they passed the ball sharply , @entity102 statistics showing the @entity19 had 64 % possession in the first half			0
with a striker able to hold the ball up and bring others into the play and yet the worry here was clear			0
@entity0 had shown they could score			1
could they defend ? @entity25 stung the palms of @entity63 twice with long - range efforts			1
a @entity45 piledriver was pushed wide by @entity63 as @entity66 stood off			0
the former @entity157 keeper , making his first @entity245 start for @entity0 , was called into action again after @entity25 's creative danger man , @entity247 made space to thump a 25 yard left foot drive at goal			1
@entity63 pushed it out and @entity49 failed to bring the ball down to guide the rebound on target			0
for all the criticism of @entity0 's transfer dealings – or lack of – over the summer , @entity63 may yet prove to be a superb piece of business			1
in a rare lapse of defensive concentration in 59 minutes @entity67 gave the ball away in his own half			1
working the ball wide to the left flank @entity25 full - back @entity48 whipped in a cross for @entity247 to direct a downward header towards the bottom right hand corner			2
@entity63 dived full length to push the ball away in a manner which suggested , if he stays fit , that @entity272 's departure may prove less than catastrophic			2
it was a fleeting moment of concern for @entity0 's number one			1
of the two goalkeepers @entity37 , at the other end , was by far the busier keeper			0
how @entity0 left here without a second goal , indeed , remains an enduring mystery			1
looking on : @entity282 manager @entity10 plots his next move while watching his players in action before the break sliding in : @entity0 midfielder @entity44 ( right ) evades a strong tackle from @entity25 's @entity49 ( left ) challenge : @entity0 defender @entity67 ( right ) has the ball stolen off him by @entity291 near the touchline they controlled the play and crafted a series of chances			1
the first in 61 minutes saw @entity70 claim a handball from @entity46 as he headed a fine cross from @entity32 towards goal			1
@entity70 had a mixed night here , in truth			0
his best moment came when he controlled the ball with his back to goal , spinning and dragging a low effort from 20 yards wide of goal			0
that came during an excellent spell for the @entity19 champions			0
they should have scored a second in 72 minutes when @entity43 embarked on an endless solo run which almost carried him through for a brilliant individual goal			2
@entity70 was screaming for the ball in the centre and would have had a tap in had the @entity124 squared			0
instead he stumbled at the crucial moment , allowing @entity37 to deal with the danger			0
the @entity25 keeper was at it again seconds later , another charging solo run from @entity165 this time - anding in the @entity323 thudding a 30 yard shot towards the top corner , @entity37 tipping the ball over the bar at the last second			2
a second goal was desirable for @entity0			1
the key was keeping composure in defence until the end			0
the arrival of @entity74 at right back offered no guarantee of that , but when @entity63 produced another excellent save by leaping to push a 30 yard drive from substitute @entity53 over the bar they were edging closer to a very decent first leg outcome .			0

@entity32 gave @entity0 the lead with a close - range finish after six minutes
the @entity7 side equalised just eight minutes later through @entity345
the result leaves next week 's second leg at @entity99 finely *poised*
the winners of the tie will qualify for the @entity2 group stage
