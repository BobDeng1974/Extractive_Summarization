you wo n’t hear @entity1 , @entity2 ’s new education spokesman , trotting out @entity2 ’s jibe that @entity4 is a ‘ posh boy who does n’t know the cost of a pint of milk ’			1
because the urbane and artfully tousled @entity1 , 39 , is every bit as posh as the prime minister			0
fees at his alma mater , @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , are nearly £ 18,000 a year			0
it is a member of the ‘ @entity16 ’ of elite private schools and to get in you have to pass a gruelling exam			1
ambition : @entity1 , @entity2 's new shadow secretary of state for education , interacts with pupils during a visit to a children 's breakfast club at @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity14 @entity1 went to @entity27 , @entity28 , the same college as his father , @entity30 , a @entity2 peer and @entity32			1
it was thanks to his dad ’s @entity36 connections that @entity1 was able to marry wife @entity38 at @entity39 , where @entity40 and @entity41 walked down the aisle			0
add a commanding height of 6ft 3in , languid good looks that made him a tv success as the ‘ @entity47 ’ , and @entity48 as a @entity49 ’ , and it is not surprising he oozes charm and confidence			2
yet , sitting in his cramped commons study , @entity1 begins the interview , his first since being appointed @entity55 in @entity57 ’s reshuffle , with a public apology			2
when @entity59 launched his free schools revolution after the 2010 election , allowing parents to set up new schools and breaking the stranglehold of teachers ’ unions and town hall chiefs , @entity2 claimed it was a wicked plot to let middle - class parents set up elitist state schools where their pampered children studied @entity72 while council estate kids were condemned to ‘ bog - standard comprehensives ’			1
days after becoming the newly elected mp for @entity76 , excitable new boy @entity1 called free schools a ‘ vanity project for yummy mummies ’			1
partner : mr @entity1 's wife @entity81 , who owns a successful homeware company could be a @entity2 ' @entity83 ' in the making now he wants to eat his words			2
‘ i regret those comments because i think any parents , be they yummy mummies or			2
’ he searches for the male equivalent , ‘			2
or faddy daddies , involved in the education of their children is great			0
’ instead of mocking @entity59 , @entity1 now wants to mirror him , by promising @entity2 ’s own ‘ parent power ’ revolution in schools			1
he wants to bury the idea that @entity2 is in the pockets of teachers ’ unions and @entity101 town hall chiefs after the party ’s pollsters discovered @entity59 ’s policy is a vote winner			1
@entity2 ’s schools will be called ‘ parent - led academies ’ ( @entity107 ) – not free schools			1
but it ’s a case of spot the difference			0
it is a highly significant moment			0
@entity57 ’s party conference speech , in which he vowed to freeze energy prices , was seen as a lurch to the @entity114 , as was his decision last week to demote three @entity117 members of his @entity118			0
yet the appointment of @entity117 young gun @entity1 , and ending attacks on ‘ yummy mummies ’ who set up their own schools , suggests ‘ @entity57 ’ is willing to steal the @entity126 ’ clothing if he thinks it will win him votes			1
like free schools , @entity107 will be set up by local parents and teachers and will be able to set their own curriculum , decide teachers ’ pay and have their own ‘ ethos ’			1
however , unlike free schools , @entity107 will only be allowed where there is a shortage of school places ; town halls will still be able to step in – though only in a crisis – and there will be curbs on ‘ untrained ’ teachers			1
@entity1 says the checks will stop scandals such as the closure of the @entity151 @entity150 free school in @entity152 following claims of discrimination against female staff and pupils			0
but make no mistake , plas are meant to be seen as ‘ @entity2 ’s free schools ’			1
‘ there are lots of parents out there who want to set up schools , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ what i am saying is if you want to do that when we are in government we will be on your side			0
there has been this perception that we would not be , and i want people to be absolutely clear that we are			0
i am putting rocket boosters on getting behind parents and social entrepreneurs			0
‘ we are not going to go back to the old days of the local authority running all the schools – they will not be in charge			2
’ taunt : mr @entity1 has accused his opposite number @entity59 of acting like @entity183 when it comes to education policy in @entity186 far from shutting down @entity59 ’s ‘ yummy mummy schools ’ if @entity2 wins , @entity1 wants more of them			1
‘ we will keep those free schools going			2
we are n’t in the business of taking them down			0
we have to clear up this question which has dogged @entity2 education policy since we entered opposition and since @entity59 began his reforms , as to what we ’d do			1
we just want to say , “ you are setting up these schools , we are behind you			0
” ’ @entity1 has praised the successful free school set up in @entity201 by his friend , @entity202 , @entity203 ’s former no 10 aide			2
would he let @entity202 set up a primary school feeder to his existing secondary free school ? ‘ yes			2
’ even if it is a free school ? he interjects : ‘ we would be calling them parent - led academies			1
’ will @entity107 offer everything free schools have got ? ‘ yes , but in an area of need , absolutely , ’ @entity1 enthuses			2
‘ the innovation , creativity , community engagement you see in the best free schools – great , let ’s have more			2
’ controversy : the new shadow education secretary once referred to @entity221 as a ' gossip columnist ' historian , prompting the academic to say mr @entity1 was more eye candy than iq to ram home the point , @entity1 says he would happily send his three young children to a free school			1
@entity59 will argue that by giving town halls even a small role , @entity2 ’s plas are not truly free but still enslaved to the left - wing educational establishment he despises			1
@entity1 counters by claiming that by running free schools from @entity186 , @entity59 is acting ‘ like ‘ @entity183 ’			1
‘ when things go wrong at a free school it has to go straight to the minister down the road like a @entity183 telling these kids what to do , ’ he scoffs			2
@entity59 , the state - educated , adopted son of an @entity245 fishmonger , loves to taunt ‘ privately educated ’ @entity1 in private			1
‘ i get under @entity59 ’s skin , ’ he says			1
in return , he has called @entity59 ‘ @entity203 ’s bastard acolyte ’ for claiming free schools are a continuation of @entity203 ’s academies			1
@entity1 once got under tv rival @entity221 ’s skin , cheekily calling him a ‘ gossip columnist ’ historian , prompting @entity221 to suggest @entity1 was more eye candy than @entity226			2
teasing @entity126 for following @entity203 is a bit rich considering @entity1 ’s undying devotion			0
‘ @entity203 was a great prime minister , ’ he says			2
so is he the true heir to @entity203 , a future leader , as @entity2 admirers claim ? ‘ no , partly for psychological reasons , ’ he reflects			1
‘ @entity203 had a messianic quality , a driven quality – not in that he was the @entity261 ! ’ @entity1 erupts with laughter , ‘ but a driven , absolute inner eye			0
am i the new @entity203 ? i do n’t think that would be true			0
’ he would have you believe he is too cerebral for the ruthlessness of leadership			0
or does the soft - spoken , self - deprecating demeanour mask the deadly ambition of other well - mannered public schoolboy politicians such as @entity203 and @entity4 ? @entity1 ’s @entity272 qualities extends to his own ‘ yummy mummy ’ wife , @entity81 , a @entity83 ’ in the making			1
even more blonde and willowy than her husband , she co-owns the trendy @entity278 homeware company whose first success was a designer handbag , just like mrs @entity281 , who designs handbags for her own upmarket label @entity284			0
@entity285 it is not : @entity81 & @entity288 wallpaper sells for £ 70 a roll and silk cushions for £ 55			0
proud husband @entity1 declares : ‘ she is a very hard - working , successful small businesswoman worried about cash flow and big companies not paying their bills within 60 days – while raising three kids			0
i ’m full of admiration for her			0
’ @entity298 says the same about @entity299			0
as a rather grand commentator on constitutional affairs , @entity1 has frequently doled out advice to the @entity303			0
indeed , if he did so to a camera lens outside @entity305 he is more likely to be mistaken for prince @entity40 than @entity57			0
he laughs when i suggest he is probably one of the few who knows as much about @entity308 as @entity57 ’s father , @entity310 academic @entity309 , did			0
@entity1 wrote a highly acclaimed book about his hero , @entity313 , who co-founded @entity315 with @entity316			0
while planting the seeds of a worldwide workers ’ revolt from @entity321 , @entity317 - born @entity313 simultaneously indulged his passion for riding to hounds			0
does @entity321 gent @entity1 share @entity313 ’s love of fox - hunting ? envisaging an embarrassing fall at his first fence , novice political chaser @entity1 mumbles something vague about fox - hunting being ‘ part of @entity321 culture ’			1
it ’s not a ‘ yes ’ , though it might sound like it to a traditional @entity126 supporter tempted to vote @entity2			1
on the other hand , an anti-bloodsports @entity2 voter might interpret it as ‘ no ’			1
which is how @entity203 won three elections for @entity2 .			0
