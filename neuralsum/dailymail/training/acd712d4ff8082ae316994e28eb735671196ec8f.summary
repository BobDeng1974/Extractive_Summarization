by @entity0 we 've all been there - you ’re so keen on a new lover you ’re practically frothing at the mouth if you ’re apart for two days , but there ’s no way you ’re letting them know that until you ’re damn sure they feel the same			1
so instead of asking ( too humiliating ) , you set up little ‘ tests ’ to see how they perform			1
@entity0 says we should n't test our partners by doing things like getting them to choose between us and their own social plans they go something like this : ' i went round to see @entity21 last night , ’ you say casually to your boyfriend , ‘ and a guy called @entity24 was there			1
’ if he instantly launches into , ‘ who ’s he ? did you fancy him ? what did he look like ? did you talk to him all night ? ’ you get the info you ’re digging for : he likes me as much as i like him			2
never mind that @entity24 was @entity21 ’s six - year - old nephew			2
or if you ’re not sure what priority you are in his life , you ’ll invite him to a romantic dinner for two on a planned boys ’ night			2
he ’s forced to choose between you or them , and @entity37 help him if he chooses the boys			2
@entity0 says we should save our plotting and scheming creativity for our sex lives we all test our partners to a point , but there ’s a huge risk in deliberately setting up scenarios like these			1
why ? because the person who ’s doing the testing is usually the one who ’s more committed to the relationship			1
if that ’s the case , your partner will probably fail every test you set them and you could walk out on what could have been a great relationship			1
people do n’t always fall in love at exactly the same rate			2
some people fall fast and hard , others take time			0
he might not be in the slightest bit interested in who @entity24 is because he ’s not as into you as you are him right now			0
six months down the track might be a different story			0
and while most of us think our tests are a foolproof way to work out where their heart is , we forget about other circumstances			1
he might choose the boys ’ night out simply because his friends are giving him grief for not being so available since he ’s met you			0
most partners fail the secret test without knowing they were being examined			0
when you test , the basic line is , ' if you loved me , then you ’d …			0
you ’re playing a guessing game with your partner forced to try to predict what will make you happy			1
but the more specific you are about what you do and do n’t want in a relationship , the more likely you are to get it - and the happier your partner generally is			1
we all like to know what ’s expected of us - it ’s not only simpler , it makes it relatively easy to side - step potential pitfalls and rows			0
' most partners fail the secret test without knowing they were being examined			0
you ’re playing a guessing game with your partner forced to try to predict what will make you happy			1
' tests are nearly always manipulative			1
driven by insecurity and a craving for some type of love declaration , they inevitably end up achieving the opposite			0
they create even more insecurity because it ’s hit or miss whether your partner knows the ‘ correct ’ response			0
the best way to avoid testing is to be honest with yourself about why you ’re doing it			0
if it ’s a need to know where you stand with your partner or want reassurance , ask them			0
if you ’re angry about something they did , tell them			0
if everything is going swimmingly well and you ’re tempted to test , see a therapist to work out why you ’re sabotaging a good relationship and perhaps struggling with intimacy issues			2
