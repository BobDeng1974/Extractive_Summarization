a watchdog found the language and presentation in the hacked off advert implied the proposals had been endorsed by @entity5 an advert by @entity7 , which is campaigning for tougher regulation of the @entity9 , has been banned on the grounds it is misleading			1
the ruling by watchdogs will embarrass the lobby group , which has been found guilty of failing to live up to the high standards of fairness and accuracy it demands of the @entity9			1
the group hoped the power of celebrity would help it to victory in its cause and crafted an advert designed to win support			1
it featured the names of more than 200 public figures it said backed its campaign , which appeared under the headline : ‘ the @entity32 ’			0
the language and presentation implied the proposals had been endorsed by the judge who led the inquiry into press standards			1
in fact , there was no such endorsement from @entity5 in the advert , which ran in the @entity43 and some other publications			0
in a ruling today , the @entity45 said the language used by @entity7 was ‘ confusing ’ , ‘ ambiguous ’ and ‘ misleading ’			1
the decision may disappoint the many famous names recruited to support the declaration , who ranged from actor @entity52 to former archbishop of canterbury @entity53			0
the @entity45 said : ‘ a national press ad featured a number of names and the claim “ what do all these people have in common ? the @entity32 ”			0
’ it went on to state that leading figures were joining people who had suffered abuse at the hands of the media to support the establishment of a new press regulator as set down in a @entity68 agreed by mps in 2013			0
the press and this new body would be overseen by a @entity72 set up by @entity68 , which critics argue is the first step towards state regulation of a free press			1
the watchdog 's decision may disappoint the many famous names recruited to support the declaration , who ranged from actor @entity52 ( pictured left ) to former archbishop of canterbury @entity53 ( right ) the @entity45 said the group was wrong to use the name @entity84 without any clear qualification as it would lead the public to believe it was ‘ one of the direct outcomes of the @entity5 inquiry , rather than a response to it ’			2
hacked @entity92 said it would appeal and insisted it had only ever used the @entity5 name to distinguish its proposals from others that were being put forward			2
it even suggested the ruling was a political decision to please the @entity9			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we believe that the advert promoting the @entity68 was very clear in what it was aiming to achieve and was not misleading			2
