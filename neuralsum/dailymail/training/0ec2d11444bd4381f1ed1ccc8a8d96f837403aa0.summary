the @entity1 cash cow is set to produce a record £ 4billion deal when the television broadcast rights for 2016 - 19 are sold on tuesday			2
but @entity5 can reveal the staggering extent to which the @entity1 already dwarfs @entity8 's other big leagues in terms of tv cash earnings , even before the new deal			0
@entity13 's top flight rakes in so much money that @entity15 earned over three times more than @entity22 champions @entity21 last season - and even @entity17 , who finished bottom of the league and were relegated , took home double that of the @entity26 giants			1
the combined tv earnings from @entity8 's top leagues last season - led by the @entity1 @entity21 won the @entity26 but earned less from tv than every one of the 20 @entity1 clubs @entity17 were relegated from the @entity1 last season but earned twice as much tv money as @entity21 the @entity34 ' limp fight against the drop earned them £ 62.1million while @entity37 's juggernaught were awarded £ 27.34m			1
just as remarkably , @entity17 also raked in around double the amount of @entity39 , last year 's @entity41 champions			1
@entity43 's side were just the fourth - top earners in @entity45 , behind @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , with £ 31.12m			1
@entity15 , despite finishing outside of the @entity1 's top four , also easily outstripped @entity21			1
the embarrassment of falling from champions to flops under @entity52 did n't prevent £ 89.2m from flooding into the coffers at @entity54			2
perhaps even more staggering is that @entity15 and @entity55 both earned more from the @entity1 than the combined total awarded by the @entity26 to the three teams other than @entity21 who qualified for the @entity59			1
@entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 took home a combined £ 75.88m , while the @entity55 pocketed £ 85m			0
@entity64 , who finished second , earned far more than @entity15 who struggled under @entity52 @entity46 earned more than £ 100million , the same as @entity47 , but three times as much as rivals @entity39 @entity39 won the @entity41 title despite their earnings being dwarfed by rivals @entity46 and @entity47 @entity64 ( £ 97.5m ) earned the most tv money of any @entity1 club last season , despite being pipped by @entity74 ( £ 96.6m ) to the title			1
@entity75 were third - top earners with £ 94.6m			0
and all three @entity13 giants earned more than the three top - earning clubs in @entity80 's @entity79 combined			0
those @entity80 ' minnows ' are @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			0
the money awarded to @entity13 clubs is , strictly speaking , derived from @entity1 central funds			0
the vast majority of this is tv money , but each club is also awarded £ 4,270,850 from central commercial income			0
that includes revenue from the likes of @entity97 ' sponsorship of the league and @entity99 , who sponsor the matchballs			0
@entity21 have long been @entity22 's dominant club but earn only slightly more than @entity60 earnings of close to £ 30m have not prevented @entity60 facing a relegation battle this season the huge sums handed down to even the most underachieving @entity1 clubs make for staggering reading , but so too does the vast inequality between the haves and have - nots in @entity45			1
simply , that means @entity46 and @entity47 on one side and every other club on the other			2
real and @entity47 both trousered a whopping £ 103.74m last season , which makes them @entity8 's chief beneficiaries from domestic tv broadcast rights			0
the five lowest earners in @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 - all took home just £ 13.34m last term			0
that means @entity46 and @entity47 scooped almost eight times more than the @entity45 strugglers			2
by contrast , although each @entity1 club is awash with cash , the differential from top to bottom is much fairer			2
@entity64 were handed 1.6 times more money than @entity17 last season			1
@entity135 continued their domination of @entity137 last season , and also earned £ 10m more than @entity138 @entity45 daily as are reporting that the @entity140 , the body in charge of @entity41 and the @entity45 second division , want to address the huge gulf between top and bottom by selling their tv rights centrally , rather than letting @entity46 and @entity47 negotiate their own separate deals			1
the aim is for the lowest - earning @entity41 club to take home no less than £ 29.7m per season			2
that would be more than third - placed @entity48 were given last season , and more than @entity21 and @entity82 reaped in winning their domestic leagues			1
but with @entity156 and @entity157 set to up their bids for @entity1 tv broadcast rights amid competition from @entity162 and @entity163 sport , even that figure will look paltry compared with the embarrassment of riches in @entity13			0
@entity82 topped @entity79 's tv money chart and also topped the table last season			0

@entity64 earned £ 97.5m last season , the most in the @entity1
@entity15 earned £ 89.2m , three times that of @entity21
@entity21 won the @entity26 while @entity15 were *seventh* in @entity1
relegated @entity17 earned twice as much as @entity21 and @entity82
despite winning @entity41 , @entity39 rank only fourth in @entity45
the club earned £ 31.1m , compared with £ 103.7m earned by @entity46
