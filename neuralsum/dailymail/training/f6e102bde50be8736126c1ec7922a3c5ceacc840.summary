by @entity0 sending a manned mission to @entity4 is ' necessary if the human race is to survive ' , @entity2 chiefs have said			0
it comes as they announced ambitious plans to land on the planet by 2030			1
speaking at the humans to @entity4 summit in @entity11 , head of the @entity14 space programme @entity15 , said : ' if this species is to survive indefinitely we need to become a multi-planet species , we need to go to @entity4 , and @entity4 is a stepping stone to other solar systems			1
astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock will hitch a ride on the next - generation @entity33 , which will also be used for trips to the @entity35 and @entity4			0
up to four people can be shuttled to the asteroid , compared to the maximum three in @entity38 , in a trip that utilises both solar power and the moon ’s gravitational pull to power the spacecraft , according to the video			2
once the @entity33 docks with the remote - operated asteroid capture device , the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from , the video shows			0
once in orbit , astronauts will be able to visit the space rock using the @entity33 spacecraft by as early as 2021			2
mr @entity15 revealed plans for the series of ' stepping stones ' to the red planet , which included ' lassoing ' an asteroid , the @entity61 reports			1
it also included growing plants in space , and using 3d printers for onboard repairs			0
@entity2 plans to capture an asteroid by 2015 and take it into the moon 's orbit , send a spaceship to it and collect samples before returning home in less than a month round trip			1
in an effort to attain a better understanding of asteroids , meteors and other near - space objects , the space exploration arm of the @entity14 government plans to capture an asteroid , fly a crew to it in a next - generation spacecraft , take samples and return home to a splashdown in the ocean			1
@entity2 is developing the capabilities needed to capture an asteroid by 2015 and send humans to @entity4 by 2030 sending a manned mission to @entity4 is ' necessary ' if the human race is to survive , @entity2 chiefs have said funding for the project is included in the space agency ’s upcoming budget , and details of the asteroid mission were outlined in a video released by @entity2 last year			1
it revealed that astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock will hitch a ride on the next - generation @entity33 , which will also be used for trips to the @entity35 and @entity4			0
up to four people can be shuttled to the asteroid , compared to the maximum three in @entity38 , in a trip that utilises both solar power and the moon ’s gravitational pull to power the spacecraft , according to the video			0
once the @entity33 docks with the remote - operated asteroid capture device , the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from , the video shows			0
using a combination of solar power and gravity - aided thrust , the @entity33 will make the 10 day trip to the asteroid though it bares a resemblance to the earlier @entity38 , @entity33 can hold more crew and is far - more advanced once in orbit , astronauts will be able to visit the space rock using the @entity33 spacecraft by as early as 2021			1
once the mission is complete , @entity33 returns to @entity144 on the same path it journeyed out on , loop around the moon included , and splashes down in an ocean – likely the @entity149 – 10 days later , as seen in the video			0
announced in the aftermath of the asteroid that exploded over @entity154 last year , injuring well over 1,000 people , @entity2 plans to dedicate $ 100 million ( £ 60 million ) to this project in the coming year , the agency said .			2
