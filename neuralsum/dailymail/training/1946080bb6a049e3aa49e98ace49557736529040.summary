@entity0 , abducted on her way home from school in 1998 , released a book called 3,096 days - based on her time in captivity a rogue policeman who attempted to obtain a dna sample from a young girl to prove that she was the daughter of kidnap victim @entity0 has been jailed for ten months			1
the @entity10 officer was carrying out an illegal investigation in an attempt to expose a theory behind the notorious @entity15 abduction - that there was more than one abuser involved			2
in 2011 and 2012 , he went into a primary school in @entity19 , @entity20 , to try to get the dna sample			0
he wanted to prove not only that the young girl was the daughter of ms @entity0 , but that she had been sexually abused by accomplices of ms @entity0 's abductor , @entity23			1
after being found guilty of an abuse of office , the suspended 63 - year - old police officer must now serve a ten - month prison sentence , the local reports			1
his case is closely connected to the retired president of @entity20 â€™s @entity31 , @entity32 , who last year was part of a commission charged with investigating official negligence in the @entity0 case			0
mr @entity32 said that he found 27 inconsistencies and omissions in the case and claimed that police ignored several vital pieces of evidence			0
it is alleged that the influential former judge is the one who first persuaded the jailed police officer to look into the case - asking him to find proof that @entity23 had not acted alone			1
@entity23 ( left ) abducted and abused @entity0 ( pictured right after her escape in 2006 ) @entity0 was 10 years old when she was taken by @entity23 while on her way home from school in 1998			1
@entity23 carved a secret , sound - proof cellar beneath his home in a suburb of @entity10 in which to keep her captive for eight years			1
long considered the victim of a paedophile who had murdered her , miss @entity0 finally escaped in august 2006			0
when @entity23 realised she had got out of the house , he killed himself by lying down in front of an oncoming train			0
since then , the case has been shrouded in mystery			0
in 2010 , a leading policeman , @entity65 , was assigned to investigate the possibility that @entity23 did not act alone			2
pictured above - the sound - proof room that @entity0 was kept in during her eight years in captivity six months after the probe ended , and after concluding that it was unlikely @entity23 did act alone , he was found shot dead on the terrace of his home in @entity75			2
at first his death was labelled as suicide , but last year @entity15 authorities suggested he may have been murdered			0
the controversy sparked an independent investigation into the death and the original handling of the @entity0 case - led by @entity32 - the man said to have hired the rogue policeman just jailed .			2

policeman wanted to prove abductor , @entity23 , had help
the 63 - year - old was jailed after his action was *deemed* an abuse of office
said to have acted after being persuaded to find out truth by former judge
the notorious kidnap , which lasted from 1998 - 2006 , is shrouded in mystery
