by @entity0 published : 16:10 est , 20 july 2013 updated : 06:14 est , 21 july 2013 victim : @entity2 from @entity3 , pictured with her son @entity4 thousands of fraud victims have had their cases ignored due to the failure of a new crime hotline			1
@entity9 is writing to apologise to nearly 2,500 people whose crime reports went missing over the past eight months because of an ‘ it fault ’			1
the blunder will put further pressure on ministers to improve the nationwide system introduced this year , which means people can no longer report fraud by calling 999 or visiting a police station			2
instead , they must give details online or ring a call centre run by a company handed £ 2 million of public cash in the past year			1
police and @entity26 ( @entity27 ) have urged the home secretary to carry out a review amid concerns that @entity9 is not giving victims support , refusing to update them on progress and failing to pass on more than half of cases to police			1
the computer problems will also heighten concerns that statistics showing a fall in crime do not fully take into account soaring levels of online scams , most of which are never reported , investigated or solved			0
@entity47 pcc @entity46 demanded action from @entity49 after constituent @entity50 , 64 , lost her £ 68,000 life savings in a bank scam , saying : ‘ the system is flawed because it ’s not focused on victims			1
’ but @entity9 failed to pass the grandmother ’s case on to police , despite the large sum involved , and did not inform her of the decision			2
it was only after she went to her local radio station and her @entity27 got involved that an investigation was launched			0
failure : @entity9 is supposed to provide a central point of contact for fraud victims but has been heavily criticised she said : ‘ i feel police action is vital or the criminals will come to understand that @entity9 is toothless and they can continue to rob at will			1
’ victims told @entity71 they felt let down after making reports to @entity9			1
in most cases their banks had already said they would not get their money back because they had voluntarily – if unwittingly – transferred it to fraudsters			0
@entity2 , a 24 - year - old hairdresser from @entity78 , @entity3 , rang the hotline after giving a £ 2,000 deposit on a flat to a ‘ landlord ’ who turned out to be a fraudster			1
concern : @entity47 pcc @entity46 has demanded action after constituent @entity50 , 64 , lost £ 68,000 in a bank scam ‘ @entity9 were n’t as helpful as i thought they would be , ’ she said			1
‘ i was constantly ringing them to find out what was happening and they would n’t tell me anything			0
’ she also asked to be put in touch with the charity @entity93 , but they only contacted her six weeks later			0
@entity95 , a 43 - year - old nurse from @entity96 , paid more than £ 3,000 for flights to the @entity98 to visit her dying father , only to discover the ‘ travel agent ’ was bogus			2
she says @entity9 told her to go to the small claims court and when she tried to explain her situation , a call centre operator hung up on her			1
‘ it was really rude , ’ she said			0
‘ we just kept going round and round , she was saying it was n’t a fraud			0
’ online fraud is one of the fastest - growing categories of crime , with official figures last week showing that thousands of people are falling victim to dating scams , in which conmen befriend them over the internet then convince them to hand over cash			0
millions of @entity120 are also being tricked into giving away bank details and passwords by fake emails , or paying for goods online that never arrive			0
@entity9 was set up in 2009 to gather information on new scams and take reports instead of police , who often lack resources or expertise to solve online scams			2
the quango ’s budget now stands at £ 5 million a year , much of which is paid to the firm @entity136 to run a call centre in @entity138			1
@entity136 started off managing telethons such as @entity140 for the @entity141 , and also operates a ticket line for the @entity143			0
complaints : home office minister @entity145 said : ' @entity9 has taken immediate action to process the affected reports ' @entity9 received 302,526 reports in 2012 - 13 but only 40 per cent were passed on to police to investigate			2
most reports are included in crime statistics , says the @entity152			0
on friday , home office minister @entity145 admitted that since november last year , 2,490 online reports ‘ were not processed correctly due to a fault in the it system ’			0
he said : ‘ @entity9 has taken immediate action to process the affected reports and will be writing to apologise to everyone and to make it clear that their report is now being dealt with			2
’ the @entity152 said @entity9 received 30 complaints between january and march this year , adding that @entity136 would have to pay to repair the it system and contact victims following the technical fault			1
a @entity152 spokesman added : ‘ we are constantly looking at ways of improving our effectiveness and we welcome feedback from @entity169 and the public			0

new hotline @entity9 has lost nearly 2,500 crime reports
budget is £ 5 m a year , much of which paid to firm @entity136 to run a call centre
fraud victims complain call centre staff are ' really rude ' and *unhelpful*
