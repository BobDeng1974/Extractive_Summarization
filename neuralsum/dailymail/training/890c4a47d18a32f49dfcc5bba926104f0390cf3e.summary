if @entity0 blowing key @entity2 rivals out of the summer transfer water was n’t patently obvious already , it is now			1
the leaders — and their £ 32million striker — look unstoppable			2
@entity8 ’s hat - trick against @entity9 on saturday was alluring in its simplicity and illustrated just what @entity12 , by his own admission , had been missing : a fine , unadulterated finisher			1
the manager is insistent that refusing to dive headfirst into an overpriced market last summer has proved correct , instead biding his time for the right man			1
@entity8 has been hugely impressive for @entity0 since joining from @entity19 in the summer @entity8 will be looking to fill his boots against a @entity22 side who lost 4 - 1 to @entity24 on saturday			1
last season ’s third - placed team have yet to record a win this campaign and sit second from bottom in the @entity31 table with a goal difference of minus four			2
as speculation increases about @entity36 ’s tenure at the club , the manager said : ‘ we ’ve just got to remain calm			2
we must n’t do anything rash			2
’ he ’s got him all right			2
that ’s seven in his opening four games			2
the former @entity19 bruiser , who joked that he is yet to win a header in @entity46 , is making a mockery of similar money lavished elsewhere			1
for all the talk about his prowess in front of goal , there is a message @entity12 wants to get across			2
@entity0 have bought more than just a poacher capable of nudging home a @entity58 assist from six yards			1
they managed to squeeze £ 28m out of @entity59 for @entity60 while doing homework on @entity8 properly , bringing in someone who has instantly become a leader at @entity64			1
perhaps not an individual to overtly coerce performances from others , but whose battling spirit makes them follow			0
@entity12 waited to sign @entity8 instead of entering and inflated transfer market last summer @entity8 is a superb centre - forward who plays like an old - fashioned @entity46 target man			1
he is no lightweight soft foreigner and was incorrectly cautioned in his first game for diving at @entity74			0
there was evidence of the more robust nature of his play when he strongly pushed away @entity9 ’s @entity79 after he was being held in the area			0
perhaps he could have been cautioned had referee @entity81 been slavish to the law , but there was nothing i saw to suggest he should have been sent off			0
the fact he was not even booked perhaps levelled things up after his yellow card at @entity89			0
@entity12 would n’t have a prayer of persuading @entity8 to have a rest without serious cause			1
last week ’s hamstring complaint did n’t keep him out at the weekend and it will take something special for the 25 - year - old not to be in wednesday ’s starting xi against @entity22 in the @entity97			1
‘ the most important thing of a player ’s character is what affects his performance , ’ @entity12 said			0
‘ he was a risk and a doubt before @entity59 , a risk and a doubt before the @entity108 game ( against @entity109 ) , a risk and a doubt before this game and he played all three			1
‘ he is a risk and a doubt again for next wednesday because of an accumulation of matches but nobody can stop him			0
’ @entity12 has tried to have a word but it falls on deaf ears			0
‘ if the injury is a clear injury of course , yes , but when the doubt is there and he has not the best feelings but he feels he can , he goes ( on )			0
he knows exactly what the team needs and is ready to give , ’ said the @entity0 manager			1
the @entity131 born @entity130 striker has now scored seven goals in four games for @entity0 ‘ it is not about the modern player , it is about the modern society			1
the education they get , the people they have sometimes behind them , make them be a little bit more selfish in the sense of you first and the team second			0
‘ when you get guys with this mentality they become special and they can be an influence to the people around them			0
’ like @entity152 ? ‘ yeah , yeah			0
’ @entity8 asserts that he is ‘ adapting very well ’ to life in @entity46 football			1
so well , in fact , that he sounded just like his skipper			0
@entity12 said of @entity8 : ‘ when you get guys with this mentality they become special ' ‘ the key is the group we have , ’ he said			1
‘ it is like a family ... we are working together and the truth is that things are going very well for all of us			0
’ @entity0 seem to have the whole package here and even one who appears to know who @entity172 striker @entity171 is			1
‘ i am very happy to have this record			0
a striker has to score and i am happy that i have a little place in history , ’ he said			0
the only blot is that @entity8 has not yet been out in @entity180 to immerse himself in the capital			1
that will come , but for now he ’s the man who can do no wrong			2
super stat : @entity8 is the first @entity0 player to score in his first four games for the club since @entity187 in 1928			1
he also beat @entity171 and @entity189 ’s record of six goals in their first four @entity2 games			2
@entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity192 7 ; @entity193 6.5 , @entity194 6 , @entity152 5.5 , @entity195 6.5 ; matic 6.5 , @entity58 8 ( @entity196 82 , 6 ) ; @entity197 6 ( @entity198 46 , 7 ) , @entity199 7 , @entity200 7.5 ; costa 9.5 ( @entity201 72 , 7 )			1
