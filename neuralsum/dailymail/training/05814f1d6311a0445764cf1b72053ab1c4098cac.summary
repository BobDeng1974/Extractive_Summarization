by @entity0 the @entity1 may not have come out on top in the team free skating competition on sunday but you would n't be able to tell that from the look on skater @entity8 's face			1
after nailing all 11 jumps in her long program , the 18 - year - old scored 129.36 - a personal best and enough to put her in second place on the individual level			1
her score also helped carry the @entity1 to third place overall in the first year a team event has been included in the @entity19			1
after the successful routine , @entity20 pumped her fist in victory and broke out in smiles			2
she nailed it ! @entity8 hit every one of her 11 jumps in the team competition over the weekend in @entity28 @entity1 : @entity20 's stellar performance was enough to carry the @entity1 team to third place overall relief : gold breathes out after her impressive long program			1
she scored only second to @entity38 phenom @entity37 look out : while the @entity1 team may have come up short in earning a gold medal in the team competition , @entity20 's performance was a good omen for what 's to come in the individual competition golden girl : this was the first year there has been a team skating event at the @entity19 medal - winners : the @entity1 team placed third overall in the team skating competition			1
@entity38 took the gold and @entity53 the silver gearing up : @entity20 will return to @entity55 with her coach to prepare for the individual competition set to start in nine days @entity20 's earnest elation marked quite a contrast to teammate @entity62 's reaction to her short - program score yesterday			1
@entity64 came off the rink smiling as well , certain that she had just placed at the very top of the competition			0
but when the scores were read out , she placed fourth and was n't impressed			0
her smile turned to a frown of disgust and she turned to someone near her and said ' b * * * * * * '			0
all smiles : @entity62 of the @entity1 celebrates in the ' kiss and cry ' area during the @entity78 at the @entity79 shock : @entity64 reacts to her score after competing in the @entity83 during day one of the @entity79 at @entity84 on february 8 ' i know roughly when i skate a good program where the score should end up ... so yeah to score that low was very disappointing for me , ' she said afterwards			1

@entity96 ( 8 ) @entity64 may feel that she 's got something to prove after her selection over @entity100 sparked a backlash on social media			0
@entity100 finished third at the @entity103 in @entity104 last month while @entity64 finished in fourth place , yet it was she who was selected to the @entity108 team			2
' it was on my mind with the media frenzy over the last couple of weeks that i needed to prove to myself and everybody else that has even doubted my belonging here that i am here to compete , to be competitive , ' she told @entity117			0
her score , however , was enough to advance the @entity1 team from seventh to third place , meaning they will be one of the top five teams to advance through to the finals on sunday night			1
it was the @entity38 team with star 15 - year - old @entity37 and veteran men 's skater @entity127 that were the undisputed winners of the competition			1
@entity37 pulled off such an impressive long program that she scored 12 points more than second - place gold			1
that performance helped the @entity38 win their first gold medal of the @entity19 , and it made @entity37 the youngest figure skater in 78 years to win the top prize			1
@entity37 's performance was so monumental that even @entity20 could hold back praise			1
together : the @entity38 won the first gold medal of the games in the team skating competition @entity143 - dropping : 15 - year - old @entity38 @entity37 wowed the audience and judges with her stellar long program , which put her 12 points above gold he 's still got it : despite being older than most of the figure skating competition , 31 - year - old @entity127 pulled off a solid performance , contributing to the @entity38 victory questions : however , there are rumors that @entity127 will pull out of his individual competitions because of a hurt back ' she 's dynamite , guys , ' @entity8 said			1
' she 's completely unfazed			0
she has no spine , but she has iron in her bones			0
she goes " @entity162 , ding , ding			0
" ' also pivotal to the @entity38 team 's success was the aging @entity127 whom many thought did n't have it in him to be a competitor in his fourth @entity19			2
despite largely not competing since the @entity169 , @entity127 pulled off a solid performance , scoring 162.20			0
' it is amazing the longevity that he has had ... to do what he does here at that age after so many years coming back without much competition experience this season , i have a lot of respect for him , ' said @entity182 , the @entity53 skater who came in second place to @entity127			2
overall , there were good feelings between the fiercely competitive @entity1 and @entity38 teams			2
after the @entity38 win on sunday , president @entity187 walked up to the @entity1 skaters to congratulate them on their performance			1
good @entity191 : @entity38 president @entity187 shakes the hand of @entity1 skater @entity194 following the @entity1 bronze victory in the team competition			1

@entity8 led the @entity1 team to a respectable third - place finish in the free - skating competition sunday
@entity38 placed first in the competition , securing their first gold medal of the games
on an individual level , @entity20 placed second overall to @entity38 sensation @entity37
@entity20 's humble was quite a contrast to teammate @entity62 who *gasped* in disgust after getting a low score in the short program yesterday
