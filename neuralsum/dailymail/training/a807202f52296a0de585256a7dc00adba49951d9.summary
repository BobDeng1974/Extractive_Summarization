by @entity1 medical correspondent published : 19:50 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 19:52 est , 30 september 2013 the figures reveal exercise has a direct correlation with the risk of high blood pressure little more than half an hour of exercise every day could cut your risk of high blood pressure by almost a fifth , say researchers			1
doing just four hours a week of physical activity during leisure time could make the difference between a healthy blood pressure and having to take drugs for life			1
new findings from the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) suggest the more recreational physical activity you get , the more you are protected from developing high blood pressure			1
researchers pooled results from 13 studies on the effects of physical activity on blood pressure in a report in the journal @entity30			1
the studies involved 136,846 people in the @entity33 , @entity34 or @entity35 who initially had healthy blood pressure			2
more than 15,600 later developed high blood pressure during follow - up periods ranging from two to 45 years			2
people who exercised more than four hours per week in their leisure time had a 19 per cent lower risk of high blood pressure than those who exercised less than one hour per week			1
people who had one to three hours per week of leisure exercise had an 11 per cent lower risk than those with under an hour of activity			1
an estimated 16 million people in the @entity48 have high blood pressure , including the third who do not know they have it			1
it is a major risk factor for heart disease , stroke , and kidney failure			0
every day there are 350 preventable strokes or heart attacks in the @entity48 due to high blood pressure			1
a high blood pressure reading is one that exceeds 140/90 millimetres of mercury ( mm hg )			2
the first figure , the systolic pressure , corresponds to the ‘ surge ’ that occurs with each heart beat			0
the condition typically has no symptoms , so it goes undetected or untreated in many people			0
in developed countries like the @entity48 , the lifetime risk of developing high blood pressure is now 90 per cent and six million @entity48 take drugs to control it - usually for life			1
people with hypertension - the medical term - are routinely advised to change their lifestyle and eat less salt , lose weight , drink less alcohol , eat more fruit and vegetables and exercise more			0
16 million people in the @entity48 have high blood pressure , including the third who do not know they have it difference : people who exercised four hours a week noticed almost 20 per cent lower risk in the experiment but the latest research show the benefits in preventing blood pressure from rising are much bigger than expected			1
dr @entity98 , study co-author and associate professor at the @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity102 , said ‘ hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular and kidney disease -- thus , it is important to prevent and control hypertension			0
‘ to try to lower your risk of high blood pressure , you should exercise more in your leisure time			1
’ researchers did n’t find a solid link between physical exertion at work and risk of high blood pressure			1
dr @entity118 , research co-author and lecturer at the @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity102 , said health guidelines advising more exercise do n’t distinguish between activity at work and for leisure , but ‘ given the new findings , perhaps they should			0
’ experts said the findings do not confirm the link but show that ' ten minutes here or there will count ' physical activity on the job , such as farm or industrial work , can involve exertion like heavy lifting , prolonged standing and repetitive tasks			2
the researchers said recreational exercise may affect several factors tied to high blood pressure -- helping people keep off extra pounds , improving poor insulin sensitivity or reducing the blood vessels ’ resistance to blood flow			2
however , the findings do n’t prove that taking exercise can prevent hypertension because people who exercise for fun may have healthier lifestyles , warned dr @entity153 in the @entity48 people are advised to do 150 minutes of moderate activity such as gardening , dancing or brisk walking , or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise including playing sport , running or aerobics every week			2
three out of four @entity48 fail to achieve this			0
@entity162 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity164 , said : ‘ the benefits of physical activity on heart health are already well known and this study goes a long way to reinforcing that evidence			0
‘ current guidelines recommend that adults do at least two and a half hours of moderate intensity activity each week			0
' you could aim for a minimum of 30 minutes on five days a week , but even ten minutes here or there will count			0
‘ keeping active does n’t necessarily have to mean joining a gym either			0
a brisk lunchtime walk with a friend or getting off the bus a few stops earlier can make a difference , too			0

new report shows the more physical activity , the more you are protected
people who exercise more than four hours a week had 19 per cent lower risk
just three hours a week cut high blood pressure risk by just 11 per cent
an estimated *16million* people in the @entity48 have high blood pressures
