the paramedics were all very nice but my daughter and i were so upset and stressed by what happened			2
' my daughter says she just ca n’t shake off the image of my wife - her own mother - lying there and us getting so distressed trying to save her			1
' dignified : mr @entity7 says he does n't blame the apologetic paramedic for the position she found herself in he added : ' i have to be strong for my family but i still suffer flashbacks of me fighting to keep her alive on the living room floor			1
' we should not have had to do that			0
they should have had enough staff to take over			0
when you call 999 that is what you expect			0
' mrs @entity10 , 64 , had suffered breathing problems at the couple ’s home in @entity72 , @entity73			1
her husband dialled 999 immediately , but was shocked when a female responder arrived in an ambulance alone			0
he said : ' when the paramedic first arrived , she wanted to move my wife into the ambulance to get some fluids into her			2
but just as we tried to move her from the hallway my wife collapsed and i knew it was serious			2
' we could n’t get her to the ambulance so we moved her in the living room so there was space for all the portable ambulance equipment			2

' mr @entity7 had been married to his childhood sweetheart for 44 years after the pair met for the first time aged 15			1

childhood sweethearts : mr and mrs @entity10 when they were first going out in the 1960s			1
they had been married for 44 years the father - of - four and grandfather - of - ten added : ' i ’m not saying that if they had sent two people the first time the outcome would have been different but at least they both would have been able to work on her			0
' i ’ve no qualms with the @entity88 as @entity10 has been brought back from the dead twice by amazing work from doctors and nurses			1
it ’s just upsetting to know my last memories of my wife are so traumatic			2
' a spokesperson for the @entity148 said : ' it is normal practice for all ambulance services to dispatch highly skilled solo responders if they are closest to assess the patient and get immediate life support to them more quickly while another crew is sent for hospital transport and support			0
' it is absolutely not true that a clinician can not administer cpr on their own			0
the very reason why they are dispatched on their own is in order to administer cpr and other basic life - support to the patient in the quickest possible time as using solo responders means getting a trained clinician with full equipment by a patient 's side quicker			0
' there may however be times when it is in the patient 's best interests for a paramedic to utilise those on scene to help with basic life support under their instruction while , for example , they are unpacking equipment or calling for assistance			2
although this reason may not have been communicated to mr @entity7			1
' this of course does not mean they are not capable of carrying out all these tasks , simply that it makes sense to use support under careful instruction and guidance if it is available , although our staff would always respect someone ’s decision not to get involved			0
' ' our thoughts are with mr @entity7 and his family			1
we would be happy to discuss this further with him if he would like to contact us			0
' no - one was available at the service today to explain why the paramedic was unable to give cpr on her own			0
