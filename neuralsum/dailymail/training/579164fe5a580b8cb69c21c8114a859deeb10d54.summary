after more than a year during which he claimed to be shut out by the military bureaucracy , army specialist @entity0 was reunited with the bomb - sniffing dog injured with him in @entity4			1
thanks to a @entity7 - era law , @entity0 , 23 , was supposed to be the first in line to adopt @entity10 , his bomb - sniffing @entity14 shepherd @entity12 unit , when they both returned from @entity4 in 2013			1
instead he spent 16 months fighting cold shoulders from the military and its contractors and searching for a dog that had all but disappeared			1
long - lost : specialist @entity0 was reunited friday with @entity10 , the @entity14 shepherd he served with as a bomb - detecting technician in @entity4 the @entity21 reports that the soldier and his parents drove from @entity24 , @entity25 , where @entity0 is stationed , to @entity26 , after he was told he could take custody of @entity10			1
@entity0 stopped 25 feet from the cage where @entity10 was and hesitated			2
' i was a little worried he forgot me , ' he later said			0
but when he called the dog 's name and the kennel door was opened , there was no mistaking that @entity10 remembered his war buddy			0
' he jumped all over me , ' said @entity0			0
' i could n’t have asked for a better response			0
i knew then that he remembered me , and truly wanted to be with me			0
' @entity0 had to sign a non-disclosure agreement not to reveal the names of those who were taking care of @entity10 in @entity26 in order to get him back , the final twist in their strange separation			2
the two had been together since basic training , and during their deployment to @entity4 , where they worked to detect explosives , were caught by a roadside bomb blast			2
@entity0 suffered traumatic brain injury , hearing loss and spinal - cord injury , resulting in surgery that has not quite alleviated the chronic pain and @entity57			0
still , @entity0 had @entity10 by his side to rely on during the remainder of his tour			2
when he flew back to the @entity61 , he slept on top of @entity10 's crate			0
long - lost : @entity0 says that he and @entity10 had been separated for 16 months with no word from the @entity65 , leading him to worry someone else had adopted him when they arrived back in the @entity61 , they were separated in accordance with standard @entity65 procedures			1
thanks to a law from 2000 known as @entity73 , which allows a returning handler to adopt his animal if they were injured together during service , @entity0 knew he only had to wait to adopt @entity10			1
but after filling out paperwork with @entity78 , a contractor charged with setting the @entity65 up with service dogs , @entity0 kept waiting while worrying someone else had adopted @entity10			1
' it ’s like someone stole your kid in front of you , ' @entity0 said before @entity10 's return , ' and there ’s nothing you can do about it			0
' the family began calling around military bases handling @entity12 units , but found no response to where @entity0 's partner had been taken			0
after a call to @entity96 in @entity97 , a civilian tipped the family off to the person they needed to contact : @entity101 , then a lieutenant colonel in charge of dog adoptions			2
' i adopted the dog out legally , so there ’s nothing you can do about it , ' @entity101 reportedly told @entity0 's father @entity110 when he phoned			1
@entity0 says that when he himself tried to contact @entity101 , they had a 30 - second conversation during which @entity101 said there was nothing he could do and told him not to call again			1
it 's not clear what finally allowed @entity0 and @entity10 to be reunited , but the dog 's return to his former handler has allowed the soldier to try and heal from his mental and physical wounds			1
' it ’s very hard to be upset around him , ' @entity0 said			0
' he brings a lot of light into everything			0
