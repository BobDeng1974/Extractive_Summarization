low fat food sold as good for you is often anything but because it contains more sugar , a study suggests			1
it found manufacturers are making their ‘ healthy ’ options more palatable by replacing fat with sugar			1
@entity10 , professor of cardiovascular medicine at the @entity12 , said people need to reduce their consumption of both			0
investigation : dispatches found that one of @entity20 ’s own - brand low - fat vinaigrette ( right ) had ten times the sugar content of the standard version ( left ) - 15.6g compared to 1.58g claim : @entity23 allegedly puts almost three times as much sugar into its ‘ 25 per cent less fat ’ peanut butter ( right ) than in its ordinary spread ( left ) - 15.2g compared to 5.5g ‘ the problem is , not only are we developing vascular disease but we ’re getting obese and getting diabetes , and that ’s due to too many calories , ’ he added			1
‘ @entity35 is a major source of calories but so is sugar , and added sugar is an unnecessary part of our diet			2
it is a dangerous substance that ’s making us obese			2
’ the study , conducted for a @entity45 dispatches investigation to be broadcast tonight , found that a ‘ skinny ’ lemon and poppyseed muffin from @entity48 had 44.3g of sugar , or just over 11 teaspoons			1
that is much more than the 35g in a can of @entity53 and the same as in a triple @entity56 choc @entity55 mud muffin from the same chain			0
the @entity48 ‘ skinny ’ blueberry muffin contains 34.7g of sugar – 8.6 teaspoons – which is more than the 28.1g in the ‘ classic ’ version of the same product			1
last week , the @entity64 closed a consultation on guidance recommending that no more than 10 per cent of our daily calories should come from ‘ free sugar ’ added by manufacturers or naturally occurring in food			1
this is the equivalent of 12 teaspoons			0
however , even supposedly healthy fruit juices and smoothies can contain much more than this			0
a supersize massimo version of @entity79 ’s ‘ red berry cooler ’ , for example , contains 97.1g of sugar , equivalent to around 24 teaspoons			1
comparison : @entity85 frozen chicken tikka masala ( top ) meal contains 7.4g of sugar - less than half what is in the @entity89 chicken tikka masala meal ( bottom ) of 16.3g fruit - based drinks from @entity92 , @entity48 , @entity93 and @entity94 were also heavy on sugar , containing the equivalent of more than 12 spoons			1
there is growing concern about the issue and health experts , including the government ’s chief medical officer , dame @entity102 , have suggested a ‘ sugar tax ’ may be necessary to cut consumption			1
the @entity107 study found a 400g pack of @entity89 low - fat chicken tikka masala and pilau rice contains 16.3g of sugar , compared with 7.4g in its standard frozen equivalent			1
a similar trend was seen in low - fat yoghurt			2
for example , a 150g pot of @entity20 black cherry low - fat yoghurt has 26.3g of sugar – 6.5 teaspoons – compared with 21.2g in its ‘ lavish creamy ’ equivalent			1
lower - fat biscuits are another culprit			2
for example , @entity127 ’s ‘ 35 % less fat ’ lighter ginger snaps have 4.2g of sugar per biscuit , or just over a teaspoon			0
that compares with 3.4g for its standard ginger snap			0
the study also found people eat more when food is promoted and labelled as low fat			2
‘ people take it as a green light , ’ said dietician @entity139			0
’ she added : ‘ low - fat foods can be good for you , but that is not always the case			0
some might be giving you a lot more sugar than you think			0
’ food companies are doing nothing illegal by having higher sugar levels in products described as low fat or light , as long as the details are included in nutrition panels			1
statistics show that 32.3million @entity160 – 61 per cent of the population – are overweight			2
of these , 13.25million are clinically obese			0
@entity163 , of the @entity164 , said : ‘ as an industry , we are committed to providing consumer choice , including lower - fat versions , and responding to demand for healthier choices			0
‘ products have very clear calorie labelling to allow individuals to compare and choose the right product for them			0

experts label some of sugar levels found in a probe as dangerous
eating ' skinny ' version of certain products could lead to health risk
