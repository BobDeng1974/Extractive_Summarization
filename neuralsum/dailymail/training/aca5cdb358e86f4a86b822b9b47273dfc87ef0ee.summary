@entity0 has accused world cycling chief @entity1 of showing too much leniency in the sport ’s ongoing battle against drugs			1
@entity1 , the former head of @entity7 cycling , has left himself open to such accusations after the @entity9 allowed @entity10 to retain their @entity12 licence despite five of their riders testing positive for banned substances			1
and @entity0 even cited the @entity9 ’s decision to ‘ rush ’ through @entity17 's request for @entity18 to get emergency steroid treatment for asthma			0
@entity0 has blasted world cycling chief @entity1 role in the sport 's fight against drugs @entity0 believes @entity1 ( pictured ) has been too lenient and has lamented him for certain decisions @entity1 's predeccesor @entity27 ( pictured ) would have been ' lynched ' for decisions , says @entity0 speaking in his latest interview , this time with the @entity30 , @entity0 said @entity1 ’s predecessor – @entity34 – would have been ‘ lynched ’ had it happened on his watch			1
‘ if @entity34 had made the same decisions @entity1 has made in his first year , he would have been lynched , ’ said the man stripped of his seven @entity37 titles for drug use			1
do we like what we have got so far ? ’ @entity0 rode for @entity10 after a four - year break from the sport in 2009 , but the team that is run by convicted drug cheat @entity45 have seen five of their riders caught by testers in the last year			1
it is also the team that boasts the winner of last year ’s tour , @entity55			0
@entity0 said ‘ everybody thinks ’ @entity10 should have been kicked off the @entity12 , while he also criticised @entity1 for failing to get team managers like @entity45 and @entity59 's @entity58 ( another former doper ) to cooperate with the panel set up by the @entity9 to investigate cycling ’s drug culture			1
@entity0 was banned from the sport and stripped of his seven @entity37 titles in 2012 the @entity66 has talked to the @entity67 twice and is now waiting to see if his efforts will be rewarded with a recommendation that his lifetime ban from sport should be reduced when @entity67 delivers its report next month			2
but he is disappointed there has not been more pressure on @entity45 and @entity58 – successful riders from the @entity0 era – to also give evidence			2
@entity0 certainly has a point			0
‘ if i 'm @entity1 , i would make it a deal point that you have to come in and talk , ’ he said			2
‘ so if @entity58 does n't talk to you , or @entity45 does n't , there should be consequences			0
i do n't know those to be examples , but i can imagine			0
‘ if you do n't come in to talk , you do n't just get passed			0
