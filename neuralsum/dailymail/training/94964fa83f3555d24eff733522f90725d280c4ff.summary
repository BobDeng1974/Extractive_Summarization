by @entity0 the world has never before seen the moment a polar bear cub opens its eyes for the first time and sees its mother			1
a video taken at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , shows polar bear @entity11 tenderly cradling her two snow - white cubs in her paws , breathing on them gently to keep them warm			1
as @entity11 's breath slowly wakes the month - old infants they open their eyes for what keepers believe is the first time , gazing up at her			2
one of the cubs even stretches out his tiny paw to pat @entity11 on the nose			2
@entity27 , wake up : a tiny polar bear cub reaches out to pat its mother on the nose in this unique footage taken at @entity8 in @entity9 which shows the infants opening their eyes for the very first time yesterday @entity33 : this still from @entity36 's footage clearly shows one of the cubs opening its eyes for the first time the video comes after another video first at @entity8 in december , when keepers successfully filmed @entity11 giving birth to her two babies			1
they were the only polar bear cubs to be born in captivity in @entity48 last year and , incredibly , their mother positioned herself in the direct view of @entity52 cameras set up to record the moment			1
now the baby cubs ' first tentative blink has been recorded on day 33 of their lives , and the footage released by @entity36 's zoologists			2
in the heartwarming video , the twins are seen sleeping in their mother 's protective embrace when one begins to stir and stretch its forelegs			2
the movements wakes its sibling , who bursts from beneath their sleeping mother 's clasp , the commotion in turn waking @entity11 , who delicately nuzzles and sniffs the nearest cub			0
it is then that the nearest cub reaches out and brushes its mother on the nose , before both open their eyes just a crack to take their first look at the world around them			0
cute : a still from an earlier video shows the infant polar bears slumbering in their mother 's embrace inseparable : the defenceless cubs huddle together beneath their mother 's foreleg in this picture proud parent : @entity11 nuzzles one of her babies - the only polar bear cubs born in captivity in @entity48 last year zoo director @entity98 said : ' polar bear cubs are always blind and it takes several weeks before they can start to use their eyes			1
' this time round the first view was of their mother which is exactly how it should be			0
it 's great that we manage to capture this moment on camera			0
' the zoo said that both the babies , the first polar bear babies born there for 20 years , were putting on weight quickly and being fed milk by their mother			1
mother 's love : seven - year - old polar bear mother @entity11 snuggles up with her twin cubs after they were born at @entity122 in @entity9 , @entity10 , on monday , the first time such a birth has been filmed in colour rare moment : the tiny twins are the only polar bear cubs to be born in captivity in @entity48 this year and , incredibly , their mother positioned herself in the direct view of @entity52 cameras set up to record the moment @entity11 gave birth to her cubs on december 9 , with the first emerging at 8.39am following a short labour			1
minutes earlier she had been biting her front paw to counteract the pain of contractions , before the eight - inch - long cub slid out			0
the infant cub was hairless , smeared in blood , blind and deaf			0
less than a quarter of an hour later , following another contraction that spurred @entity11 to shake and push her back legs forcefully against the wall , a thin arm , small head and then another arm of another cub came into view			0
however , @entity11 was so busy with her first born that she did n't immediately realise that she 'd even given birth to a second baby for another 20 minutes			2
out it comes : @entity11 gave birth to the first of the pair at 8.39am on monday following a short labour			0

' @entity122 is now bracing itself for a surge in visitors			1
when @entity179 the polar bear was born in @entity180 at the end of 2006 the capital 's animal park was flooded by visitors keen to catch a glimpse of the cub			1
that @entity11 has managed to keep her youngsters alive this long is already an impressive achievement			0
