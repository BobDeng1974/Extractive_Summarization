as one of the world 's most successful female designers , @entity0 was unlikely to turn up at the @entity5 marathon in trainers			1
despite it being an off - duty day , the 41 year old wore a pair of skyscraper heels to cheer on her son @entity11 , 12 , in the children 's marathon earlier today			1
she accessorised her skinny jeans , leather jacket and ' @entity17 ' t - shirt with a pair of @entity19 , which retail at approximately £ 1,500			1
we 're so used to seeing her in midi skirts and dresses from her own collection that seeing her in a sleeveless wrap top and jeans takes a bit of getting used to			2
but when it comes to basics , like the rest of us , she has her favorites			0
she actually has worn these super skinny jeans countless times before , and it 's easy to see why			0
they 're by @entity45 , a label loved by a-listers like @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 and they fit like a dream			0
when paired with platform ankle boots , @entity53 's legs look like they go on forever ! this season , the biggest denim trend has been jeans that are ripped to shreds			0
but we love this much more subtle approach - look closely and you 've notice that these dark wash jeans feature distressed detailing all over			0

@entity0 is a devotee of huge heels - in her early years of fame she was never seen without a pair on and once said of flat shoes : ' i just ca n’t get my head around the footwear			1
