@entity1 emails leaked on friday reveal the tumultuous relationship between @entity1 chair @entity3 and writer @entity4			1
in fact , after one tense exchange between the two over what screenplay he would work on next for the studio , @entity9 emails a few of her fellow executives saying that @entity4 is ' broke ' and implies he is ' sleeping with ' the author of a new book he wants to adapt into a screenplay			1
the emails , obtained by @entity60 , show that @entity38 wants @entity4 to adapt the @entity62 book @entity40 : a @entity63 for the studio , while he would rather work on @entity29			1
@entity4 's major problems with @entity40 , according to his emails , are that there is little plot and the main character is @entity70 and ' there are n't any @entity70 movie stars			2
' making matters worse is that the @entity55 film , for which he wrote the screenplay , was falling apart at the same time , with director @entity76 dropping out and @entity23 and @entity77 refusing to star			0
@entity4 , as revealed in previously leaked emails , was also upset that @entity80 had been given the title role			1
what angers @entity38 is when @entity4 's agent , @entity87 , emails to say the writer will be passing on @entity40 in favor of adapting @entity29 - and shopping it to other studios			1
that email came on november 13 , one day after @entity89 broke news of the story			0
this after @entity4 was apparently paid for @entity40 , and the studio gave him millions for his @entity55 screenplay			2
that is when @entity38 emailed @entity95 , president of @entity97 and @entity98 , as well as @entity99 and @entity100 , the co-presidents of production at @entity97			0
she wrote ; ' he is broke … he wants to get paid … we paid him his insane fee on flashboys … when the poker movie came around we did n’t want to not be in @entity4 business so we wanted that too … i do n’t care if @entity4 is sleeping with the girl or not … i do n’t care if it becomes a beat seller … they are treating us like sh * t. ' the way they were : @entity4 and @entity38 are close as he has written numerous screenplays for the studio , including @entity52 and @entity53 the timing of this email release could not be worse for @entity38 , as @entity4 just voiced his support for the studio head			1
' @entity3 knows more than a lot of people what it 's like to battle stereotypes			0
she 's a woman at a large corporation who worked her way from assistant to the chairman 's office , ' @entity4 told @entity135			2
' no one in the world feels worse than she does right now , and the thing about @entity3 's character is that it 's not because she was caught , it 's because she did it			0
' @entity3 would rather cut off her own hand than intentionally hurt someone			0
' @entity38 has yet to comment on this latest leak .			0
