by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 20:58 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 06:00 est , 14 november 2012 imposing boardroom quotas for women would be ' patronising ' and wrong , women 's minister @entity3 said yesterday			1
in a major speech on women 's role in the economy yesterday , mrs @entity3 dismissed a drive by the @entity9 to impose a minimum 40 per cent quota for women on company boards			1
she said more still needed to be done on both equal opportunities and pay , but insisted policy would not be driven by ' political correctness '			2
removing barriers : women 's minister @entity3 has called for greater support in helping women reach their goals rather than imposing quotas ' it makes no sense to stifle the achievement and aspiration of 50 per cent of our society			1
' it is absolutely essential that we maximise the contribution that women can make to our economy			0
' not because of political correctness , but because of economic reality			1
now more than ever , we need to remove barriers to the workplace			0
' the way to do this is not through special treatment or regulation like the @entity9 's quotas idea , which patronises women and undermines the business case			2
' it is about removing the barriers to achieving their goals , and so that women are supported all the way from the shop floor to the boardroom			0
' sources in @entity48 last night said the @entity49 was poised to abandon its controversial quota plans because of opposition from @entity52 and other countries			2
mrs @entity3 also unveiled a £ 2 million scheme to boost childcare and help more women find a job			1
grants of up to £ 500 will be available from next april for people setting up a nursery or childminding business			0
the money will help cover legal and insurance costs , health and safety training and equipment , while advice and mentoring will also be offered			0
mrs @entity3 hopes £ 2million scheme will boost female entrepreneurs mrs @entity3 said the scheme would create jobs and help reverse a decline in the number of childminders , which has been identified as a barrier for women wanting to return to work			1
she said : ' the childcare industry is already a major employer of women , and this scheme will provide huge opportunities for female entrepreneurs to start up and run their own businesses			2
' this is an injection of cash designed to stimulate the sector in tough times , the new scheme will provide more childcare places but will also help get up to 6,000 new childcare businesses off the ground			0
