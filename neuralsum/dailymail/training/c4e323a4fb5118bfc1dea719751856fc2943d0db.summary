the chancellor said there was an increasing risk that the stand - off between @entity2 and the rest of the @entity10 would end with a ' very bad ' outcome for everyone			1
he said ' a miscalculation or a misstep ' on either side would hit the @entity16 and wider global economy			1
chancellor @entity0 said there was an increasing risk that the stand - off between @entity2 and the rest of the @entity10 would end with a ' very bad ' outcome the chancellor was speaking after prime minister @entity22 met officials from the @entity24 and @entity25 for a meeting at @entity27 to discuss measures to protect @entity16 from the consequences of a possible @entity2 debt default or exit from the euro			1
speaking at a meeting of @entity35 finance ministers in @entity36 which has been dominated by the situation in @entity2 , mr @entity0 acknowledged that a crisis in the eurozone would spill over to affect the @entity16 and warned of the dangers of a ' chaotic and disorderly exit '			1
' there 's no doubt that the @entity16 economy would be affected by a crisis in the eurozone			1
we know that from recent experience , ' he told @entity50			0
' he added : ' that 's why we need to take steps to protect ourselves at home			0
and that why it 's right that we step up our contingency planning			0
it 's why i see it is vital that we go on working through our economic plan so that we are taking steps to secure and strengthen our economy			2
' @entity2 's new prime minister , @entity63 ( left ) - elected last month on an anti-austerity platform - is facing a showdown with the @entity67 chancellor @entity66 over writing off @entity2 's debts @entity2 troops march to the front in 1941 following the @entity72 invasion that year @entity67 has rejected @entity2 's demands for £ 120bn in reparations for @entity76 damages – adding there is ‘ zero ’ chance they will pay			1
new @entity2 prime minister @entity63 , in his first major speech to parliament , said his country had a ' moral obligation ' to claim repayment for a forced wartime loan and other reparations			2
mr @entity63 's anti-austerity @entity89 party claims @entity67 owes it around £ 120bn , or around half the country 's public debt , which stands at over £ 235bn			0
@entity2 had ' a moral obligation to our people , to history , to all @entity97 peoples who fought and gave their blood against @entity99 , ' mr @entity63 said to parliament			2
but @entity67 's economy minister rejected the call , insisting the matter was concluded with a signed treaty 25 years ago			0
' but the idea that @entity16 or indeed the rest of the world is entirely insulated from what happens in the eurozone is sadly not true			2
' @entity2 's new prime minister , @entity63 - elected last month on an anti-austerity platform - insisted last night that he was confident of reaching a deal on the £ 240 billion national debts which his @entity89 party blames for six years of deep recession			2
following talks with @entity118 chancellor @entity117 in @entity119 as part of his whirlwind tour of eurozone capitals , mr @entity63 said that only ' political reasons ' could block a deal with @entity2 's creditors , adding : ' i think that would be a decision to torpedo our common @entity97 future			1
and i think nobody harbours such intentions			0
' but @entity2 has suffered a ratings downgrade , tumbling share prices and hikes in bond interest since @entity89 came to power , while the @entity138 has said it will no longer accept its bonds as collateral for credit			2
it remains unclear whether compromise can be reached at an emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers in @entity145 tomorrow			0
@entity67 chancellor @entity66 has said she is waiting to see whether @entity146 puts ' a sustainable proposal ' on the table			0
mr @entity0 said : ' it 's clear to the world economy that this stand - off with the eurozone and @entity2 is growing each day and i think the risks of a miscalculation or a misstep leading to a very bad outcome is growing as well			1
' and so , here at the @entity35 , we are urging all parties to this dispute to try and find some common solutions and we are also at home stepping up our preparations for whatever the outcome may be			0
' we have to make sure that the @entity16 people are best protected from whatever develops in this crisis , because i am clear that the @entity2 exit from the euro would be very difficult for the world economy and potentially very damaging for the @entity97 economy			1
' we have to be prepared for that outcome			0
so we have to make sure that we choose a path of competence and stability over potentially a chaotic and disorderly exit			0

chancellor said there was an increasing risk the stand - off will end badly
he said ' a misstep ' on either side would hit the @entity16 and global economy
comes after the @entity188 held crisis talks over a possible @entity2 debt default
