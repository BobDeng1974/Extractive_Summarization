the civilian police worker was sorting through bundles of evidence when she mistakenly read that the officer involved was @entity6 - when in actual fact it was the scene of the crime , the computer store @entity6			2
the cash had been seized after a raid at @entity6 in @entity15 earlier this year and had been placed in a police safe ahead of criminal proceedings			1
@entity6 , the computer store , not to be confused with ' @entity3 ' as the police worker was sorting through evidence , however , she did n’t put two and two together and put out a search for a constable world to contact her about the cash			1
