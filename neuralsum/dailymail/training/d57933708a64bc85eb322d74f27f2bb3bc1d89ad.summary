@entity0 and @entity1 have rejoined @entity3 ’s injury list and are ruled out of friday ’s @entity5 fourth round trip to @entity6			1
@entity0 limped out of last weekend ’s win at @entity8 while @entity1 is understood to have picked up an injury in training			1
however , manager @entity11 expects to have @entity12 and @entity13 available again for a tie he warns could produce an upset if @entity6 do not respect their @entity17 opponents			1
@entity1 will miss @entity3 's trip to @entity6 in the @entity5 fourth round @entity0 ( right ) is also injured and will not feature for @entity3 in the @entity5 fourth - round tie @entity11 confirmed that @entity1 and @entity0 will miss the tie during his pre-match press conference @entity23 ( left ) celebrates scoring with @entity24 during @entity3 's 2 - 0 win over @entity8 @entity11 looks on from the touchline during @entity3 's victory against @entity8 ‘ it ’s always tough to play against teams who are weaker in the players ’ minds , ’ he said			1
‘ for example , on wednesday @entity34 , the @entity32 in the @entity33 lost against the @entity36 of the second division ( @entity38 )			2
it shall happen also in the @entity5			1
there are always surprises and i hope that we are not the surprise			2
‘ we prepare the same way and of course it ’s maybe in another way because in our minds you believe that we are playing a weaker opponent but it ’s not like that			0
it ’s another opponent with another playing style , and if you lose the game you are out			0
‘ for me it ’s not a change or an exception because we prepare our matches the same way as @entity58 matches or friendly games			1
it ’s very good that we have a process and the players have adapted to that process already in six months			0
’ @entity12 is back in the squad and is available for @entity3 's tie on friday night @entity66 enjoys a chuckle as he speaks to the media during his pre-match press conference on thursday left back @entity13 has also returned to the fold following injury and @entity66 could call upon him @entity72 ( right ) slots the ball past @entity74 to ensure @entity3 leave @entity75 with a victory @entity6 won away at another @entity17 side , @entity77 , in the last round but @entity66 expects a more direct , aerial approach from @entity80 - comparing the challenge with last week ’s win at @entity8			1
‘ when you see @entity80 and analyse them , they play very direct with long balls , ’ he added			0
‘ they have five or six players above 1m 90cm , so for us it is difficult to defend			0
that ’s why you have to prepare yourself very well			0
it is not so easy to beat @entity6			1
@entity8 in the last match is also how @entity80 play			0
‘ the @entity5 is different more in the atmosphere i think			2
here it is very important for the fans and people and players , that ’s the difference			0
ok in @entity102 it is fantastic when you win the cup but not so like here			0
also the attendances are much higher here than in @entity102 or @entity109			0
the @entity110 , where @entity6 will take on @entity111 in the @entity5 fourth round @entity80 show their upcoming fixtures , including against @entity3 , on their club board at @entity110 @entity66 says @entity80 plays lots of ' long balls ' and he hopes his side do not fall to a ' surprise ' result @entity120 ( left ) scores for @entity3 during the 2 - 0 victory over @entity77 in the @entity5 third round the @entity80 players train ahead of their @entity5 clash with the @entity58 giants ' of course when you play @entity129 or @entity130 there is always a full crowd but there are not many matches in @entity102 and @entity109 like that			1
’ @entity66 refused to confirm if @entity135 will make his @entity6 debut in goal after signing an 18 - month deal at @entity139 , or whether @entity140 will be sold amid interest from @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144			1
‘ he is a @entity3 player , that is the update			2
@entity140 is the only player who has already won the @entity5 in my selection			2
he is also my captain , one of the three			0
that is what i can give			0
i ’m not sure because it is the transfer month			2
’ @entity135 could make his first start for @entity3 since signing on a free transfer @entity66 would not be drawn on whether or not @entity140 ( left ) will be sold this transfer window @entity23 ( second left ) runs to the bench to celebrate with fellow @entity157 @entity156 ( fourth right ) @entity159 ( right ) endured a frustrating afternoon at @entity75 , missing a number of chances the @entity163 forward ( right ) turns around and starts to try to get to his feet after missing a chance @entity166 ( centre ) prepares to spread a ball to the side side during @entity3 's win at @entity75 @entity66 looks on sternly from the dugout at @entity75 during the trip to @entity173 last monday			1
