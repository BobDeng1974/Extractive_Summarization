as she stepped off the royal train at @entity4 yesterday , a succession of flunkies could be seen ferrying the @entity6 's wardrobe from the locomotive to a waiting van			1
piles of garment bags and stacks of hat boxes could all be seen peeking out - and all this just for one weekend away			0
but as royal watchers know , the monarch , 88 , has a reputation for never travelling light and has a team of dressers to ensure that no matter what happens , the @entity6 will always look pristine			2
experienced traveller : the @entity6 and the @entity22 arrived in @entity4 by @entity23 yesterday in total , the @entity6 's wardrobe department includes 12 people whose job it is to make sure she looks great on big occasions such as yesterday 's visit to @entity31			2
for that , she wore a chic lavender coat by designer @entity34 and a matching hat by dresser @entity36 , all accessorised with one of her trademark @entity41 handbags			2
@entity36 , who has been working with the @entity6 since 1994 , is the head of the wardrobe team , which also includes three dressmakers , a milliner and four dressers , who , as their job title suggests , help the @entity6 get dressed as well as keeping unworn garments in pristine condition			1
during busy periods , such as 2012 's @entity53 celebrations , the team drafts in extra staff , with an additional two needed for the spate of events that accompanied the jubilee celebrations			0
doubling up : @entity36 , her personal assistant and curator of the royal wardrobe , ensures that a duplicate for every outfit is close to hand in case of spillage or a similar fashion disaster cosmetic carriers : within her beauty bags is specially made foundation , hat - pins and lavender - scented cloth outfits are chosen by the @entity6 , with miss @entity36 , @entity36 makes notes of the @entity6 ’s wishes and ideas for alterations before producing a final technical drawing from which the pattern is cut			1
to stop her feeling uncomfortable or getting too warm when she is on official business , the @entity6 insists on loose clothing			2
all of her clothes are made of natural fibres : 100 per cent pure cotton or wool , no linen ( it creases too easily ) and certainly no polyester			2
when she travels , @entity36 , her personal assistant and curator of the royal wardrobe , ensures that a duplicate for every outfit is close to hand so that if something is spilled on her clothes or there is any other mishap , @entity6 can discreetly change into a new set without anyone knowing - which perhaps explains the two garment bags in the back of the van			1
if disaster does strike , the ensemble wo n't be sent to a dry cleaner - all clothes are hand - washed , steamed and pressed by one of her three dressers to avoid any unpleasant chemical smells			0
tagged : each of the bags bore a large yellow label marked : the queen anniversary : the @entity6 and prince @entity22 spent their 67th wedding anniversary at @entity31 as for cosmetics , @entity36 uses a special , secret formula for the @entity6 ’s foundation , which prevents too much shine on her face			1
another royal beauty secret is a gel that keeps her hair firmly in place ( even in gale - force winds ) and is mischievously known among royal staff as ‘ liquid concrete ’			0
her majesty ’s hairdresser also keeps a couple of huge hat - pins handy , just in case the ones already in place do n't prove equal to the task			0
incidentally , you will never see @entity6 removing her headgear in public ; she always waits until she is safely back indoors			0
and it is n't it just clothes and make - up in the @entity6 's cases			1
when she is travelling , the monarch is never without several cases of @entity145 water - always still , never sparkling			0
she is jokingly said to suffer withdrawal symptoms when deprived of her bottle of @entity149 there ’s a plentiful supply of @entity151 , her favourite , which is made especially for her by @entity153			0
she favours a blend of @entity155 and @entity156 , ‘ delicately scented with oil of bergamot ’ , and drinks it with a special sweetener , which she carries herself			0
arm candy : the @entity6 with one of her favourite @entity164 baggs - the brand say she takes a selection on trips staying hydrated : her majesty always travels with @entity151 , left , and several cases of @entity145 water coffee is supplied by the @entity173 coffee department and is much favoured by the @entity22			1
though she carries her own bag ( which contains just a handkerchief , lipstick , a tiny mirror and a copy of the day ’s programme ) , one of her ladies - in - waiting always has what is known as the ‘ @entity183 ’			0
this holds all the essentials she might need in an emergency : spare pairs of tights , gloves , sweeteners and a moist , lavender - scented cloth in case of extreme heat			0
she also carries a hook to hang her bag on from the table , her reading glasses , mint lozenges and a collection of good luck charms given to her by her children , including miniature dogs , horses and saddles			1
one item the @entity6 does not pack is her own lavatory seat - unlike prince @entity206 , who it is said takes a white leather one on every official trip			1
outfits ( and duplicates ) hand steamer special , secret formula foundation hat pins still @entity145 water @entity218 tea her own sweetener coffee supplied by the @entity173 spare pairs of tights gloves a moist , lavender - scented cloth in case of extreme heat lipstick ( rumoured to be by @entity229 ) @entity230 glasses mint lozenges good luck charms			1
