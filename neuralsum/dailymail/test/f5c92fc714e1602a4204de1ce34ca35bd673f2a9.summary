not a day goes by that 14 - year - old @entity0 does n't scream in pain			1
born with @entity2 - or ' butterfly skin ' - his body is covered with deep blistering wounds that will never heal			1
holding cutlery to eat is incredibly difficult			0
his skin is as fragile as a butterfly 's wing team work : @entity0 , 14 , said he could not get through life without his mother @entity17 who carries and feeds him ' you never know exactly what @entity2 is unless you have it ... just the feel of it , the pain that you live in every day , ' the bandaged teenager remarks in an interview with the @entity24			1
' even when i 'm sleeping , when i 'm dreaming , i still am sort of conscious because i feel that pain			2
' unless a cure is found , @entity0 will likely only live to 25			1
but in a tone well beyond his years , @entity28 - based @entity0 says frankly : ' i just have to get on with it			1
' one in every 17,000 people suffer from the genetic condition			0
healthy skin is made up of three layers , but @entity0 is missing the middle layer which holds the inner and outer layers together			1
dreams : he had to stop playing sports so has turned his focus to sportscasting - and the experts are impressed with his maturity and knowledge			2
he is pictured here with a @entity46 junior ice hockey player difficulties : both @entity17 and @entity0 say they try not to think about the fact that he has a life expectancy of 25 inspiring : he says he can even feel pain when he is asleep but is trying his best to ' live in the moment ' sufferers are dubbed the ' butterfly children ' due to the fragility of their skin : as breakable as a butterfly wing			1
the condition has outlined @entity0 from many childhood activities			1
a sports fanatic , he played hockey and loved gym class until his condition meant he could not compete with the other children			1
@entity2 ( @entity2 ) is a general term used to describe a group of rare inherited skin disorders that cause the skin to become very fragile			2
any trauma or friction to the skin can cause painful blisters			0
@entity72 has the rarest form of @entity2 where blistering occurs at the junction between the epidermis and the dermis			1
in most cases , the symptoms of @entity2 are obvious from birth			2
it is caused by faulty genes inherited from one or both parents			0
there are many cases when both parents are carriers of the faulty gene without realising it			0
just one in every 17,000 children has it			0
there are thought to be 5,000 people living with @entity2 in the @entity94			2
there is no cure for @entity2 so the treatment aims at preventing blisters becoming infected			2
moving forward , he is channeling his fascination into other aspects of sports			0
he has appeared as a sportscaster on @entity105 tv shows , and guest commentated football games for @entity108			0
' it 's unfortunate but you 've just got to go with the flow , there 's nothing i can do about it , ' he told the @entity24			0
' i just studied different options - if i ca n't do this i 'll think of other options			1
so that 's why i came into sportscasting and scouting and coaching , that 's where it all started			0
' i ca n't play sports but there 's much more to sports than players			1
' professionals are astounded , remarking on his knowledge , his confidence and his maturity			0
@entity0 credits these attributes to his condition : ' because i ca n't play sports , i stay with the adults			1
so i guess i had to kind of grow up faster			0
' he admits there is a ' nagging ' feeling at the back of his mind every day that ' i only have 10 years left			2
' but for now , he 's trying to ' live in the moment			0
' ' great things do not come easily , ' he told an audience at @entity145 last week			0
' but they do come when you try with your full heart , when you 're willing and open to embrace life , when you take things one day at a time and use what you 've got			2
' his mother , @entity17 , said it is a struggle every day as she bathes him , knowing he is in pain			1
however , she cherishes the silver lining : ' i see him every day waking up with a smile			0
