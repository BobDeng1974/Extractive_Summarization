by @entity0 published : 03:51 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 12:31 est , 11 september 2013 a man who was shocked to learn the beautiful woman beside him as he came out of surgery was his wife today revealed he can not remember any of the hilarious conversation caught on camera			1
@entity7 and his wife @entity8 appeared on the today show on wednesday morning after the cell phone video - in which he calls her ' eye candy ' and ' the prettiest woman i 've ever seen ' as his anesthesia wore off - became an internet sensation			1
but the @entity17 couple was also forced to deny the video was a fake after it emerged mr @entity7 had a profile on an auditions website where his occupation was listed as ' actor / model '			1
' i can understand the skepticism , ' he said , but added that he had given permission to his surgeon to tell the media that he had indeed undergone a procedure before the video was filmed			1
' i 'm glad she had the sense to pull out her camera			0
' his wife added : ' he had been acting like that for about 20 minutes before i pulled out my phone			2
i thought , " i need to record this so he can see how he acts "			0
' he genuinely did n't remember a thing about that when i told him			0
' in the clip a bleary - eyed @entity7 lays on a hospital gurney eating a cracker and moaning in pain before looking over at his wife			1
he asks : ' did the doctor send you ? man you are eye candy ! woah			2
you 're the prettiest woman i 've ever seen			1
are you a model ? who are you ? what 's your name ? ' giggling from behind the lens @entity8 replies : ' i 'm your wife			0
' visit @entity73 for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy ' i hit the jackpot ! ' : the video taken after @entity7 underwent anesthesia for a hernia operation captures his shock at learning the beautiful woman beside him is actually his wife out of it : @entity7 calls his wife @entity8 ' eye candy ' and the ' prettiest woman i 've ever seen ' in the video apparently dumbfounded , @entity7 murmurs : ' you 're my wife ? ! @entity91 s * * * ! @entity92			1
how long ? man , i hit the jackpot ! ' mr @entity7 said he was undergoing surgery for a hernia repair to fix residual tears from a previous surgery			1
' this was my fifth surgery within our six years of marriage and she 's been by my side through all of it , ' he said			0
' in a previous surgery i suffered a severe complication and we did n't know if i 'd ever function the same again			0
she is the love of my life			0
' but claims that the video was faked were circulating last night after an old profile of @entity7 was found on an auditions website where his occupation is listed as ' actor / model '			1
describing himself as ' very ambitious ' and listing a range of sports including soccer , baseball and motorcross among his special skills , the aspiring actor says his objectives are movies , tv shows and commercials			2
another development saw dr. @entity130 , a memory loss specialist at the @entity132 , also cast doubt on the clip which now has millions of @entity136 hits			0
' @entity137 ' : @entity7 and @entity8 married six years ago and he has had five surgeries during that time speaking to @entity140 dr @entity130 said that the type of amnesia which would cause somebody to forget parts of their life is a psychiatric condition and is not associated with surgery			2
amnesia caused by a lack of oxygen in surgery usually stops people from making new memories rather than forgetting old ones and is more similar to @entity156 's , he explained			0
dr. @entity130 added that while a lack of oxygen could cause a patient to forget some things , it would n't wipe out six years of marriage			0
but the @entity163 ' denial that the video is no fake will no doubt please the legion of commenters who were quick to praise him as ' husband of the year '			2
one user had lamented : ' why ca n't i find a guy like this ! ' another added : ' i ca n't decide who is the genius of this operation			0
@entity7 , for saying this on camera or his wife for making sure it was documented ! '			1

in the clip , which became an internet sensation , @entity7 is filmed in bed in hospital as he expresses his shock the beautiful woman is his wife
' man , i hit the jackpot ! ' he says . ' you 're the prettiest woman i 've ever seen '
the couple appeared on the today show on wednesday and dismissed claims the hilarious video was a hoax
denial comes after *online* profiles emerged listing @entity7 as an actor
