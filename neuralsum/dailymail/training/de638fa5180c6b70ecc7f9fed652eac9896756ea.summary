by @entity0 how often have you been frustrated by a rotating fan that , after blasting you with a burst of cold air , continues turning to point towards an empty room ? thankfully , one company has a solution			1
@entity10 manufacturer @entity9 has designed a fan with an built - in infrared sensor			1
it detects when a person is in range , to begin blowing them with air - and will turn itself off if the person leaves the room			1
@entity10 manufacturer @entity9 has released its new automated fan that can track humans with an infrared sensor			1
it is able to turn up to 85 ° and blast people with air , rather than other fans that turn and blow into an empty room			1
if it detects no - one within range for about a minute , it will shut down and stop blowing air the device is known as the ‘ human - sensing @entity31 ’ , model number @entity34 - @entity33			1
the oscillating fan , pictured , detects a person 's presence with its infrared sensor bar			2
the product is on sale in @entity10 it retails in @entity10 for 18,000 yen ( $ 176 ; £ 105 ) but there are no plans to bring it to other countries just yet			1
the company claim they expect to sell about 25,000 of the fans by april of next year			0
the device works by having an infrared sensor bar below the fan			2
this can sense the heat signature of the area around it			0
when a human is detected the fan can turn , up to a range of 85 ° , to blast the person continuously with air			1
the sensitivity of the sensor can be set at three different levels , to make sure it tracks the right things			0
it can also track multiple people ; if it sees more than one person , it will take turns in pointing towards each of them			2
if it detects no - one within range for about a minute , it will shut down and stop blowing air			2
thus the device is not only handy , especially for hot countries , but it should help cut down on energy usage when it is not being used			0
back in @entity79 experts launched a new bladeless fan that is 75 per cent quieter and eliminates the tone that equates to the irritating mosquito hum than its previous bladeless fan			0
however the sound of silence does not come cheaply - the designer fan ranges in price from £ 219.99 to £ 299.99 ( $ 370 to $ 500 ) depending on the size and style			0
the company has spent some £ 40 million ( $ 67 million ) on developing its @entity92 bladeless fans , which come from laboratories that employ 1,500 scientists and engineers			0
the design for @entity98 fans includes an innovation called a @entity101 cavity , which effectively dissipates some of the soundwaves caused by the fan			0
the engineers identified which tone was the most irritating to the human ear , which is equivalent to a mosquito ’s beating wind , and have managed to quieten it .			0

@entity10 manufacturer @entity9 has made a fan that tracks movement
the ' human - sensing @entity31 ' uses infrared to point towards people
it is able to detect a person in a range of up to 85 degrees in a room
this ensures it blows air only towards people , and not empty space
the device is now on sale in @entity10 but there are no plans yet for @entity133 or @entity134
