@entity0 was sold same year out of bankruptcy court by @entity2 published : 11:20 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 11:30 est , 20 february 2013 @entity5 's newest casino - which opened less than a year ago - is filing for bankruptcy , it was announced today			1
@entity7 , the casino that many people had hoped would turn around the @entity11 's flagging fortunes , said it will file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in march			1
the $ 2.4billion enterprise never caught on as much as expected , and it languished near the bottom of @entity5 's 12 casinos in terms of revenue			1
@entity7 , the casino that many people had hoped would turn around @entity5 's flagging fortunes , said it will file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in march @entity21 , ceo of @entity7 , and his wife , @entity23 , greet employees moments before the new $ 2.4billion casino resort opened in @entity11 last february the voluntary , prepackaged bankruptcy envisioned for late march will wipe away about two - thirds of its $ 1.5billion in debt by converting more than $ 1billion of it into equity for lenders			1
@entity21 , @entity7 's ceo , said the restructuring will give the casino resort more flexibility to operate			1
' today 's announcement is a positive step for @entity7 , ' he said			2
' the agreement we have reached with our lenders will ensure that the hundreds of thousands of guests who visit @entity7 every year will continue to enjoy a signature @entity7 experience in our world - class facility			1
' existing management will remain in place , no layoffs are planned , and employees and vendors will be paid as usual , according to the company			2
the downfall of @entity7 is just the latest in a series of recent bankruptcies involving @entity5 casinos			1
@entity54 emerged in 2010 from the third chapter 11 bankruptcy that it or its corporate predecessors had filed			1
and the @entity0 was sold that same year out of bankruptcy court to billionaire @entity58			1
the restructuring should be completed by early summer , it added			2
@entity7 had to line up two rounds of additional financing since august to keep operating			2
in january , it posted its second - worst month , winning less than $ 8million from gamblers			2
during the second and third quarters of last year , it reported gross operating losses of $ 35million and $ 37million			1
@entity7 's work force is largely non-union - a fact that earned it the undying enmity of local 54 of the @entity75 union , representing most of the city 's casino workers			1
' over three years ago , local 54 began expressing to every elected official in the city , the state and the governor 's office that this project was doomed to failure , ' said @entity85 , the union 's president			1
' had they listened to us three years ago , we would not have this catastrophe on our hands now			2
' @entity91 , governor @entity92 's press secretary , expressed confidence in @entity7			2
he said : ' we are committed to the resurgence of @entity5 , the tourism district , and the many efforts currently under way to bring world - class attractions and entertainment to the city , ' he said			1
' a rejuvenated @entity7 will remain an integral part of that landscape , as it continues full operations as a premiere hotel , gaming and top - flight entertainment hub for the city , in addition to employing more than 2,000 people			1
an @entity5 worker vacuums the @entity110 near the @entity7 - but the entertainment group has failed to hoover up profits ' most importantly , none of those things that make @entity7 among @entity5 's highest - profile attractions will change , as @entity7 uses this new financial flexibility and the continued backing of its investors to grow the business and be part of @entity5 's expansion			2
' @entity122 , director of the state @entity123 , said the @entity126 filing needs to happen			0
' the agreement between @entity7 and its lenders will allow for a necessary financial restructuring and improve the property 's financial condition going forward , ' he said			0
' we see this as a positive step that will allow @entity7 to comprehensively address its financial needs while continuing normal business operations			0
' @entity7 officials have been reviewing their options in recent months as the @entity5 market continued to decline and its own revenues remained stuck in neutral			1
@entity21 said the company and its lenders decided that a prepackaged @entity126 would be the best way to improve its balance sheet by eliminating substantial debt and increasing the changes for growth			0
as part of the restructuring , some of @entity7 's lenders will provide approximately $ 250million in debtor - in - possession financing , about $ 45million of which constitutes new money commitments and approximately $ 205million of which is pre-petition debt			0
no taxpayer funds will be used to finance the restructuring , the casino said			0
the company did n't identify which lenders will be part of the filing ; it said only that ' a majority ' of its lenders have agreed			0
@entity7 opened in april as a potential game - changer - the first new casino built in @entity5 since the @entity164 opened in 2003			0
@entity7 was designed as a destination resort , an ambitious , risky project in a declining market			0
it saw itself not as a casino resort but as a resort that happened to have a casino			0
but the distinction seemed to have been lost on many customers , who found its restaurants and hotel rooms pricey			0
the project had to overcome numerous obstacles before its opening			0
three key executives working on the project died in a @entity182 plane crash in july 2008 ; a worker pouring concrete was struck by lightning and killed in 2011			0
the project ran out of money during the recession and had to stop construction halfway through			0
@entity189 pulled out , taking a $ 1.2billion loss on the project			0
it only got completed with the help of state tax incentives that were approved in february 2011 .			0

it is third recent *casualty* in the @entity11 city
@entity54 emerged in 2010 from chapter 11 bankruptcy
@entity0 was sold same year out of bankruptcy court
