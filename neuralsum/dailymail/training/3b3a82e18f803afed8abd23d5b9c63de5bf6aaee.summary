@entity12 was forced to cut a tv interview with @entity2 short as she justified giving her teenage daughter @entity5 injections			1
' i would prefer to oversee my daughter 's @entity5 than have her going underground finding a voodoo witchdoctor or getting it off the internet and administrating it herself , ' she said defiantly			0
but appalled by her behaviour , @entity12 shook his head in disbelief stating : ' i try and to be really polite to all my guests			1
' i just think you 're dreadful and i honestly do n’t want to talk to you anymore , so i ’m just going to stop			2
' the 51 - year - old , self - confessed plastic surgery addict recently relocated to the @entity11 to launch her eight - year - old @entity28 as a child beauty pageant star , believing she could give the stars of the controversial show @entity34 a run for their money			1
however her insistence on teaching her young daughters to pole dance , giving them vouchers to spend on plastic surgery and throwing them @entity5 parties is proving unpopular on both sides of the @entity45			2
following the show @entity12 added : ' i regret having here on in the first place			1
' i think encouraging her little daughter to pole dance and giving her plastic surgery vouchers and then telling the media about it ... ' i wish her the best , i certainly do n’t want to be rude to anybody			2
' miss @entity2 , who has spent more than £ 500,000 on her own surgical enhancements , first made headlines in 2010 when she confessed to teaching her then six - year - old daughter to pole dance			1
and she has since been in the spotlight numerous times - for all the wrong reasons			2
last year miss @entity2 , who then resided in a £ 500,000 four - bedroom home in @entity64 , @entity65 , boasted that she gave a £ 6,000 breast enlargement voucher to her daughter			1
she said in an interview with closer magazine at the time : ' @entity28 begged me for a boob job , so i gave her the voucher so she can have it after she 's 16 , when it 's legal			2
if she develops naturally big boobs , she can have something else done with it			0
' the voucher was part of a £ 12,000 ' exotic pamper party ' that she organised to mark her daughter 's birthday			0
poppy and seven friends had manicures , pedicures and makeovers			0
they dressed up with fake tattoos , drank pretend champagne in the back of a pink pamper bus and ate a designer cake costing £ 250			0
' i honestly do n't want to talk to you anymore so i 'm just going to stop , ' @entity12 told miss @entity2 @entity28 wore a £ 300 dress for the party , adding nail varnish , eyeshadow and hair extensions			1
miss @entity2 said : ' @entity28 is n't interested in bouncy castles or pass the parcel , so i splashed out on something a little more grown - up			1
' the girls got lots of attention from our neighbours			0
they love having all eyes on them and were posing and pouting for photos , ' she said			0
as well as the breast enlargement voucher , miss @entity2 bought her daughter thousands of pounds worth of gifts , including a £ 250 computer , a £ 450 pink @entity116 crystal ring and necklace set and the promise of a £ 4,000 spa break			1
the main event though , was the breast enlargement voucher			0
@entity28 said : ' i wanted a new computer , a holiday and a voucher for surgery			0
when i got it all , it was a dream come true			0
all my friends were jealous			0
' i ca n't wait to be like mummy with big boobs			0
' @entity12 also asked @entity2 to explain the photos of her eight - year - old daughter ( who was seven at the time ) on a stripper pole , and points out , ' it does n't just happen to wind up in the paper , you contact the @entity141 tabloids , you contact the papers and let them know about this stuff			1
' @entity2 responded : ' i let people know that it 's good , it 's good exercise and in fact , more people should actually try it than stuffing their faces with burgers			2
' controversial : @entity2 gave daughter @entity151 injections when she was just a teenager coming to @entity11 : human barbie @entity2 thinks daughter @entity28 will take the pageant scene by storm @entity28 is already well - accustomed to having her hair , make - up and nails done at the tender age of eight			1
