by @entity0 published : 06:58 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 03:00 est , 7 march 2013 this is a cat who has certainly used up one its nine lives - after it survived a 3,400 journey from @entity6 to the @entity7 when she was accidentally packed in her owner 's suitcase			1
@entity11 only realised her mistake when she was called by relatives in @entity14 as she sat in a taxi in @entity16 - on - @entity17 , @entity18 , on her way to visit her sister			1
she was so convinced her beloved pet @entity23 , a seven - year - old @entity21 would be dead that she had to get the taxi driver to check her luggage			1
vets said it was a ' miracle ' the animal survived after its long journey in the cargo hold of a plane			2
but @entity32 has not yet been able to return home as he has been put in quarantine for six months			1
ms @entity11 , 42 , believes she unwittingly zipped her pet inside the case after @entity32 crawled in for a nap			1
the cat somehow managed to go unnoticed through security at @entity56 and was stacked into the hold of the plane with hundreds of other bags			2
she was called by relatives , who realised the cat was missing , as ms @entity11 travelled from @entity62 along the @entity63 to her sister 's home			1
her sister @entity66 , 40 , said : ' when she realised what had happened she said she was trembling			2
she thought she would be dead			2
@entity68 , owner of @entity69 in @entity70 , says it 's a miracle that @entity32 survived the plane journey ' how could she survive ? at the airport the cases could have been thrown and banged about			1
' @entity11 , 42 , returned to @entity6 after spending a few weeks staying at a flat in @entity76 , @entity77 , and visiting her sister			1
but she had to leave @entity23 in quarantine at a kennels in @entity81 , where she is still waiting for the all - clear to be shipped safely back to @entity6 in the summer			1
@entity68 , owner of the centre , described the cat ’s adventure as a ' miracle '			2
he said : ' she ’s a healthy , happy , laid - back @entity21 who likes sitting outside in the sunshine			2
' i ’ve never heard anything quite like it before			2
apparently she was fine and when the bag was opened was like " well this is comfortable , if a bit different "			0
' air miles moggy : @entity32 slipped through security at @entity14 unspotted and was stacked into the hold of the plane with hundreds of other bags for the six - hour flight he added : ' i spent 21 years working for @entity101 before i did this and in holds you get the same air as you get upstairs but it ’s not circulated or heated			1
' but if you think about it she would have been well insulated with all the other bags around her and she ’s very furry with a massive coat			0
' in my experience cats and dogs have got into holds and its just luck whether or not they survive			0
' ms @entity11 was in a cab on the @entity63 en route to her sister @entity66 ’s home in @entity18 when a relative in @entity14 called on her mobile to say it was thought she had accidentally packed her own pet			1
@entity66 , 40 , said : ' they stopped the cab and the taxi driver offered to look as she was so upset			0
he said " do n’t look " as he opened the bag for her			0
' but @entity32 was alive			0
my sister just had her in her lap in the taxi the rest of the way to @entity77			0
the @entity21 cat is more used to @entity14 than @entity18 - and will soon be allowed to return home ' when she got into the flat in @entity76 where my sister was staying she was scared because it was a strange place and hid under the bed			1
' ' we just could n’t believe it			0
our family had looked everywhere and they realised she must have got into the suitcase			0
' after @entity11 took her cat to the vet for a check - up following her ordeal on december 28 , @entity32 was put into quarantine at @entity70 , where she is still waiting for the all - clear to be shipped safely back to @entity6 in the summer			1
@entity150 ’s @entity149 arranged for @entity23 to be kept in quarantine after they were contacted by the vet which @entity11 had taken her to			1
animal importation issues fall under the remit of trading standards			0
@entity149 manager @entity158 said : ' it is a very unusual situation as we have dealt with cats coming into the @entity7 in cargo containers - but never a suitcase ! it was @entity165 when we got the call ; we just did n’t believe it			0
i ’m amazed it survived			0
' it is illegal to bring a pet into the @entity7 without the right travel documents , which from @entity6 include proof of rabies vaccinations , which @entity66 said @entity32 had had done			0
@entity149 said they took no further action in @entity32 ’s case as they were satisfied she had been brought in by mistake .			0
