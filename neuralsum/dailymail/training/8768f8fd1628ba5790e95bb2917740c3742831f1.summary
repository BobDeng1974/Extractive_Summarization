@entity7 ’s squad moved across town this week in to their new £ 200m training base opposite the @entity10			1
now it has emerged that the first team will effectively use the ‘ @entity18 ’ as a hotel the night before home games , eating and sleeping there before making their way across the road to the stadium			1
city have always used the @entity50 on @entity52 ’s @entity51 but their players will now effectively have their own bedrooms at the training ground			1
@entity7 will also expect his players to head back there after afternoon games for a meal and recuperation			2
it is understood that the players will not use the centre on friday night ahead of saturday ’s game against @entity19 as only a third of the new training ground is fully operational			2
this means they could well use it for the first time ahead of the @entity52 derby on november 2			0
