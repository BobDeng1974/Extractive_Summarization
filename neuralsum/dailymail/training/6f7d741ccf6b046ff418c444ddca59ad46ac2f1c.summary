@entity43 - 6 @entity47 , though the odd miskick and aberration still makes you worry			0

needs to work on end product			0

@entity137 - 5 @entity2 's solid start was ruined when he somehow allowed @entity4 to drift in front of him and head home			1
@entity141 - 6.5 lost the possession badly to present @entity0 with a first half counter attack - but they failed to capitalise			2
otherwise did well in midfield			0

@entity153 - 6.5 his first half strike which flew over @entity26 's goal was a wasted opportunity which blighted an otherwise effective performance			2
@entity23 - 7 characteristically energetic performance causing @entity0 a few problems in the first half - but had little support to speak of			2
@entity23 lacked support from his team - mates in a characteristically energetic performance @entity34 -6 got little change out of @entity31 and so one of @entity2 's most potent weapons was neutered			2
@entity167 - 5.5 worked hard holding the ball up and running channels but ultimately to little			0
substitutes @entity171 ( @entity97 ) - 6 had barely taken the pitch before he was picking the ball from the net			0
