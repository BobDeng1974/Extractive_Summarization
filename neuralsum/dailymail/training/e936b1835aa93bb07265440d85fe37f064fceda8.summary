by @entity0 for @entity1 a @entity4 footballer who is fighting testicular cancer learned he had the disease from a scan following an on - pitch challenge that left him in pain , it was revealed today			1
@entity13 's @entity12 midfielder @entity11 underwent surgery and chemotherapy following the discovery of a tumour last year			1
speaking about his battle with the disease for the first time this week , the 31 - year - old told how he was given the heart - breaking diagnosis after being tackled by former @entity24 player @entity23 in a match in 2013			1
@entity13 footballer @entity11 has spoken about his battle with testicular cancer for the first time despite being diagnosed in 2013 , the player only revealed on tuesday that he had been diagnosed with cancer the player had kept news of the illness to his family and close friends - even telling people he had shaved his head for a bet when they questioned where his trademark long black locks and facial hair had gone			1
but he says he has now decided to speak publicly about his battle to help show other sufferers that the disease can be confronted and beaten			1
talking to @entity45 's @entity44 , he said : ' i had a very hard collision with @entity23 in the area of the pubic bone and the genitals			1
from then i had a lot of pain that would n’t go away			0
' i spoke with the doctor straight after [ the game ] and he said : " if it does n’t hurt then do n’t worry i do n’t think it is anything [ to worry about ] "			0
then it was holiday time and i felt the pain more in the testicle			1
' we started the pre-season , the season started and in september , october i noticed that the testicle started to become inflamed			2
' i felt a pain when i put my underpants on ; it was uncomfortable			0
i went back to the doctor and they told me to have an ultrasound scan and they detected a tumour and told me i needed an operation			1
@entity73 - diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1997			1
@entity75 - diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1999			1
@entity77 - diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2009 , which later spread to his brain			1
@entity81 - diagonosed with acute leukaemia in 2012			0
' i could n’t understand why they were using the word tumour and not cancer so i asked them : " ‘ is it cancer ? " and they confirmed that it was			2
i left the clinic crying			0
' the challenge by @entity24 's @entity23 was not malicious and there is no blame attached to the other player over the incident			1
@entity11 , who is currently single , flew back to his native @entity45 for treatment and doctors in @entity99 removed his left testicle in october 2013			1
after it was confirmed the disease had not spread to other parts of his body ; the player was given the all - clear but told to return for a check - up in five - months			2
in that first check - up doctors found traces of the cancer and prescribed a course of chemotherapy , which @entity11 is now on the point of completing			1
he has since started down the difficult path of telling fellow players and fans about what he went through			0
he said : ' no one really knew about it at first			0
gradually you start telling people			0
some people saw me without hair and if they were not close friends or family i would say i had done it for a promise			0
' what are you going to tell them without telling them everything			0
' @entity11 , pictured in 2010 , said he was left ' crying in the clinic ' after he discovered he had the disease the collision between @entity23 and @entity11 came when @entity13 hosted @entity24 in may 2013 @entity11 was left writhing around on the floor in agony after the challenge and later had a scan he added : ' sometimes you think about things and then when a problem , like the one i have to go through at the moment , comes along it makes you realise that all the other problems are insignificant			1
' obviously this is the most difficult game i have had to play but like all games it will have an end to it and the end is closer now			0
' despite fears over fertility , he is certain he will be able to have children in the future			2
he said : ' when you have this problem they send you to the sperm bank and you leave various samples of sperm in case the other testicle in case the other one does n’t work			2
' but i have every confidence that the other one will work			0
we have full confidence for the moment			0
' he said he was speaking about his battle with the disease publicly in order to help others fight it			2
he added : ' it removes some of the pressure talking about it and i also think it can help a lot of people who are passing through a similar situation to be strong and to fight and to see that these are situations that you can overcome and emerge stronger from			0
' @entity11 , pictured in 2012 , is the latest player to battle the cancer , following @entity73 and @entity77 the @entity13 winger said doctors uncovered a tumour after a tackle by @entity23 ( pictured , right ) testicular cancer is most common in men aged 15 - 44 and around 2,300 are diagnosed in the @entity192 each year			1
the most common symptom is a lump or swelling in part of one testicle , but 20 per cent of patients also experience pain in their testicles or lower abdomen			2
a feeling of ' heaviness ' in the scrotum is another symptom			0
a microscopic image of a human cancer cell people with an undescended testicle have a greater risk of testicular cancer as do people with a family history of the disease			1
it is five times more common in white men than in black men and is also more common in tall men			0
it is , however , one of the most treatable cancers			0
ninety - seven per cent of patients survive for more than five years after diagnosis and 96 per cent survive for more than ten years			0
once someone has been free of the disease for five years they are considered to be effectively cured - and can go on to live a normal life			2
the increase in survival - which was less than 70 per cent in the 1970s - is down to the development of the chemotherapy drug cisplatin			0
although chemotherapy is the biggest risk to fertility , about 70 per cent of men are still able to father children			2
@entity239 , head of the @entity240 team said : it ’s not inevitable that testicular cancer patients will lose their fertility and even if they do it can come back			1
' it is also good to talk to the doctor about the possibility of sperm banking before treatment starts			0
