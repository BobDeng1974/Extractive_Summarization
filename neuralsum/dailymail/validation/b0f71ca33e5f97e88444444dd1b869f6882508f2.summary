a teething baby can be hard work			0
so spare a thought for @entity4 ’s gorilla troop , whose latest addition is already showing off her first gnashers			1
three - month - old @entity8 smiled for just long enough to let onlookers – including her mother @entity10 , 15 – catch a glimpse of two bottom teeth poking through			2
zookeeper @entity14 said : ‘ until the last few days , @entity15 has been cradling @entity8 in her arms and carrying her everywhere , but we ’ve now spotted her carefully placing @entity18 on her back , so that she can move around more freely			0
the animal was born in december say cheese : @entity8 reclines in her mother 's arm as she smiles for the camera			1
she is the only baby in the enclosure ‘ this , along with @entity8 getting her first teeth , is an exciting milestone for us , as it signals that she will soon be crawling and taking her first steps			1
’ @entity8 was born in december after spending eight and a half months in mother @entity10 's womb			1
the female gorilla mated with @entity39 ’s upon his arrival in 2013			0
their baby - whose name means ' most beautiful ' - is @entity39 's first offspring and a special addition to the zoo 's gorilla enclosure			2
baby gorillas typically spend around two months on their mother 's body before they begin to move around on their own and eat solid food			1
@entity8 will be reliant on her mother for around three years before feeling confident enough to act on her own			0
feeding time : mother @entity15 cradles the baby in the gorilla enclosure at @entity4			1
@entity8 will spend a few months breastfeeding before being able to eat solid food snoozing : the new mother and her baby take a nap together with the rest of the gorillas out of sight keeping baby close by : @entity15 roams around the enclosure with baby @entity8 tucked under her arm look at me : in a picture taken last month baby @entity8 , with her hair still growing , looks lovingly at her mother first - time father @entity39 has , according to keepers , taken a back - seat approach to parenting , leaving most of the hard work to @entity15			1
' @entity15 is a very attentive mother			0
throughout the day she 'll be looking at her hands , her feet , she 'll be cleaning them , she 'll be licking them			0
so she 's incredibly attentive , ' said @entity78 , gorilla keeper			0
' she 'll move her around depending on where she is on her body to be more comfortable			0
' whenever mum has something to eat you can see @entity8 looking at it , she does the classic baby thing where she puts her fingers in her mouth and she 'll even try to go out and grab it			2
' the next steps will probably be where @entity91 actually moves away , she 's able to grab some food if mum lets her and she 's able to eat some solid foods so maybe she 'll just come off of mum and starts moving around on her own			2

@entity8 the baby *silverback* gorilla was born at @entity4 in december
