the fossil of an ancient animal covered with spines that resembles a ' squashed bird 's nest ' , could shed new light on life in @entity8 ’s ancient seas			1
@entity9 lived 520 million years ago and belonged to a group of bizarre , balloon - shaped animals called chancelloriids , which had an outer skeleton of defensive spines			1
its fossilised remains were unearthed in @entity17 , in southern @entity18 , and is nmow offering a glimpse into how early life functioned			0
the ‘ @entity26 ’ lived 520 million years ago and it its fossil resembles a squashed birds nest , according to experts			1
this imahe shows the whole creature , which measures three - and - a - half inches ( 9cm ) long the animal was flattened during the fossilisation process , giving it a squashed appearance			1
the rocks where it was found yielded a diverse array of fossils preserved with traces of their soft anatomy , including their legs , eyes , guts and even brains			0
most of the fossils are animals that can be related to modern forms , including distant relatives of arthropods such as crabs and lobsters and a wide variety of worms			2
but among them are several enigmatic fossils that do n’t seem to fit in with anything living today , including chancelloriids			0
the ancient creature belonged to a group of bizarre , balloon - shaped animals called chancelloriids , which had an outer skeleton of defensive spines			1
this image shows individual spines , which are a few millimetres long the ancient creature lived around 520 million years ago in ancient oceans			1
it belonged to a group of balloon - shaped animals called chancelloriids			2
chancelloriids had bag - like bodied with an orifice on top and show no signs of having had internal organs			0
different species come in different shapes and sizes , ranging from cone - shaped creatures to disk - like and cylindrical specimens			0
they probably lived on muddy sea floors - some with the help of ' anchors ' - and are often found attached to other organisms or shells			0
they were probably filter feeders			0
@entity26 was discovered in @entity17 in southern @entity18			2
the animal was flattened during the fossilisation process , giving it a squashed appearance			0
it bears no resemblance to living marine animals , unlike some of the other fossils found			2
dr @entity99 from the @entity100 said : ‘ there is only one fossil of this enigmatic animal after 30 years of collecting by our @entity18 colleagues at @entity17			1
‘ it is exceptionally rare , but it shows us just how strange and varied the shapes of early animals could be			0
@entity112 , a phd student from @entity100 ’s @entity113 who is working on the skeletons of @entity116 fossils , said : ‘ we usually only get the broken - up remains of ancient animal skeletons			1
‘ with this specimen we can see how all the different parts of the skeleton stuck together			0
‘ it tells us much about how early animals functioned , how they might have interacted with other animals , and how they might have protected themselves from predators			0
’ the creature was unearthed by professor @entity126 from the @entity127 at @entity128 in @entity18 , in collaboration with the universities of @entity100 and @entity131			2
it was described in the journal @entity134			0
the fossil has been named in honour of @entity100 palaeontologist professor @entity137 who was a world leader in @entity17 fossil research and passed away earlier this year			1
the name of the fossil is derived from the @entity142 , meaning ‘ bird ’s nest ’ or ‘ fancied resemblance to ’ and adelric , which comes from from the @entity146 personal name ‘ @entity147 ’ - ‘ adel ’ meaning ‘ noble ’ and ‘ ric ’ meaning ‘ a ruler ’ - which is a source for the name @entity137			1
the fossil has been named in honour of @entity100 palaeontologist professor @entity137 ( pictured ) who was a world leader in @entity17 fossil research and passed away earlier this year			1

the @entity26 fossil dates to half a billion years ago
it *teaches* us about the diversity of life in @entity8 's ancient seas
in life the animal was a ‘ balloon ’ shape and was also covered in spines
but the fossil resembles a bird ’s nest because it was squashed
the creature bears no resemblance to modern animals on @entity8
it ’s named in honour of @entity137 , from the @entity100
