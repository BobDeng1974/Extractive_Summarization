footage of what appears to be a great white shark in the sea off @entity4 has ignited fears that a real - life @entity6 is roaming @entity9 's coastline			1
fisherman @entity10 , 44 , was on his boat 20 miles off @entity12 when he spotted it on the port side of his boat and pulled out his mobile phone to film it			1
shark experts who have viewed his footage said it was certainly not native to @entity9 waters and that it was ' probably a great white '			1
fisherman @entity10 filmed this shark , said by some experts to resemble a great white , off @entity12 man - eater in @entity4 ? the footage shows a 14ft creature lurking alongside mr @entity10 's boat , @entity28 mr @entity10 , who runs fishing and boat trips with his @entity32 business , was fishing when he spotted the enormous creature , which he estimated at more than 12ft long , circling his boat			1
he said : ' i was fishing on the starboard side and went to the port side to get the deck hose when i saw it			0
' mr @entity10 said he did n't want to suggest what he thought , but common consensus on his @entity42 , where he posted the footage , was that it was either a great white or an oceanic great			1
@entity45 , a shark specialist and author of @entity47 , said : ' if the fish was was 14ft long , it probably was a great white - it would n't be the first off @entity12			1
' he said a similar sized shark was seen off @entity12 last year , and said it was most likely swimming around looking for food			0
shark aficionado @entity54 wrote : ' looks like a small great white ' , before adding : ' the more i look at it , the more it looks like a great white			2
' other shark watchers suggested it might be an even more deadly oceanic whitetip , a species described by oceanographer @entity63 as ' the most dangerous of all sharks '			1
four years ago an oceanic whitetip terrorised guests at the popular @entity68 resort of @entity69 , killing one woman and attacking four others			2
a source at @entity12 coastguard told @entity74 they had n't had any reported sightings of a great white ' we do get sharks of various types off the coast of @entity4 , it 's not unusual , but they 're primarily the large basking sharks			1
' terrifying man - eater : the great white shark has rows of serrated teeth and can smell blood a mile away experts said it was a basking shark because of its shape and its fins , and also ruled out other species such as mako , porbeagle , bull shark or thresher			1
great whites , made famous by the 1975 film @entity6 , weigh 2,000lbs and are feared as man - eaters			1
they have razor - sharp serrated teeth and can smell a single drop of blood from a mile away			0
they usually prefer warmer waters than those around @entity9 , but scientists have warned they may be tempted to the southern @entity9 coastline as sea temperatures rise , particularly after a hot summer			2
earlier this year a great white named @entity110 was spotted 1,000 miles off the south west , having swum 19,000 miles across the @entity112 from @entity113			2
marine biologists said it appeared to be heading for @entity9 , where the mild weather had left the sea teeming with smaller fish to eat			2
this afternoon the @entity9 - based @entity119 played down fears of a killer circling our shores , saying it was most likely a young basking shark			0
@entity125 , director of conservation , said : ' we â€™re yet to have a verified sighting of a white sharks in our waters			0
we do have an environment that is suitable			0
' warm blooded great white sharks live in coastal temperate waters around the world , preferring areas that have lots of seals for them to eat			1
they have been found in water as shallow as 300metres deep , and waters going down 1,200metres , in locations including @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity113 's west and east coasts , @entity146 , @entity113 , and off @entity147 and @entity148			0
great whites have also been spotted in the @entity150			0
they do n't like water that is too warm , so are rarely spotted in tropical waters , and they either swim right at the bottom near the sea bed or up at the top			0
where the sharks roam : great whites live in coastal temperate waters around the world ( marked in red ) all attempts to keep a great white in captivity have failed because marine biologists have failed to work out the ideal conditions to keep them in			2
one great white in @entity142 had to be released because it kept banging its head against the aquarium wall			0
as a result , those who wish to see great whites close up have to go diving in shark cages			0
last week @entity9 expat @entity173 , 50 , was mauled to death by a great white in @entity142 's @entity176			1
the businessman was doing his regular one - kilometre swim when the shark bit into his leg , leaving him to bleed to death in the water .			0
