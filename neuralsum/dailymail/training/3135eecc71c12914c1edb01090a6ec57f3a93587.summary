explorer : @entity1 claimed to have found an @entity2 in @entity3 in 1911 explorers are restarting an extraordinary hunt for an @entity6 @entity2 that a gold - seeker first claimed to have found in 1911 - after using @entity8 to plot where they believe it stands			1
the men from @entity13 , @entity14 , have made five trips to an area near the border of @entity3 and the @entity18 , where it was first claimed that a gold reef was found			1
@entity1 said in 1929 that 18 years ago he had discovered a reef buried under sand hills in the remote @entity23 - and received backing from @entity25 financiers to find it again			1
he was deserted by his companions and camels during the mission and eventually died of exhaustion and malnutrition - but still found the reef , according to his diary which was later found			1
it was discovered in a cave in the @entity35 , south - west of @entity36 , and a series of expeditions in the next few years failed in their attempts to find the gold , reported @entity42			2
but eight decades later there are still faint hopes that the treasure could still be located - by a team involving friends @entity47 and @entity49 , who have wanted to find it since they were children			1
they have been through mr @entity1 's diary , which includes sketches and accounts of his last journey , and traced this by matching landmarks with features on the @entity8 maps software			1

@entity78 often suggests that gold is present - and he has since made five trips to the area , convinced he has found the reef			2
