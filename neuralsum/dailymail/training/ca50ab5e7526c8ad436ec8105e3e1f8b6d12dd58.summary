by @entity0 published : 09:47 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 17:55 est , 25 june 2013 revolutionary : the soft robotic exoskeleton suit being developed at @entity5 's @entity4 for the @entity7 @entity6 a robotic exoskeleton that is so light and comfortable it can be slipped on like a pair of trousers is being developed by @entity5 scientists for a @entity7 @entity12			1
the contraption , called the exosuit and comprising of a harness with tubing that wraps around the wearer ’s legs , helps people lift heavier loads than they are naturally capable of			1
experts hope to eventually merge the prototype exosuit with real clothing so it will become a second skin and benefit athletes , soldiers and those who can not walk because of muscle injuries			1
‘ you can imagine something like a spider web that 's integrated into tightly fitting pants , ’ @entity30 , a robotics researcher at @entity5 's @entity4 and leader of the team that designed and built the exosuit , told @entity34			1
the suit is not the first robotic exoskeleton to have been trialled , although it is probably the most comfortable			0
hard metal and plastic outfits like those are already beginning to give paralysed people the ability to free themselves of wheelchairs but they are heavy , cumbersome units of machinery			2
the exosuit is more of an enhancer than an assistant			0
it is much lighter than the hard prosthetic exoskeletons , weighing just 7.5 kilograms ( not including the air supply that drives the artificial ‘ muscles ’ )			0
also , the suit relies on the existing movement of the legs as a person walks - its talent is adding extra power or force at the just right moment			1
the suit 's performance was tested by five healthy males after they trained to use it for about three days			2
@entity70 said that the suit is confusing to react to at first , but once a person adjusts to the extra ' body part ' , they feel the the subtle benefits			1
the exosuit is more of an enhancer than an assistant , helping a person pick up heavier loads than they might naturally be able to			2
it is hoped the protoype will be developed into a suit that can help athletes and soldiers he said : ' when you wear it , you feel like you 're getting a bit of a boost			1
after you stop wearing it , you notice that you do n't have that extra assist any more			0
’ though applications and large - scale manufacture are years away , @entity70 says the suit will see development in three main areas			0
in the military , it is hoped it will help soldiers walk farther and carry heavier loads			2
for athletes it could form the basis for performance enhancing prostheses			0
experts say the exosuit would need to be custom - fit to a person 's frame and gait much liked a bicycle must have its handlebars adjusted to the user and in rehabilitation medicine it could be a breakthrough treatment for people who can no longer walk because their muscles are damaged			1
the suit would need to be custom - fit to a person 's frame and gait , but that 's a one - time thing , @entity70 says , ' if you buy a bicycle you have to adjust the handlebars and then it 's set			0
' after that , he explained , ' every time they want to wear it , they [ can ] pull it on like a piece of clothing			0

the ' exosuit ' is being developed by @entity5 experts for the @entity7 military
the suit uses *technology* to enhance the body 's natural movements , making heavy loads lighter and movement *smoother* with no extra effort
experts hope the suit will one day help athletes , soldiers and injured people *undergoing* rehabilitation
