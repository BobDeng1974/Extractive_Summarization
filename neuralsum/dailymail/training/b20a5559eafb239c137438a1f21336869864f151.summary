by @entity0 published : 15:57 est , 7 january 2013 updated : 11:15 est , 8 january 2013 a hardworking immigrant who won $ 1 million on the @entity2 last summer died of a lethal dose of cyanide poisoning the day after receiving the check for his winnings			1
he bought this $ 1million scratch - off winner just before his death fateful purchase : @entity7 spent $ 60 in june on two @entity28 state lottery tickets			1
the second one of which proved to be a winning ticket @entity7 had apparently forsworn lotto after a trip to the @entity34 in 2010 , but broke down to buy the tickets at this @entity12 7 - 11 last june days later , with his wife and daughter at his side at the same convenience store , @entity7 gleefully - and fatefully - accepted an oversized , mock check from lottery officials			1
at the time , he said he was going to utilize the money to pay bills , donate to @entity44 and grow his dry - cleaning business			0
after taxes , the prize money amounted to $ 425,000 and @entity7 received his check a month after his win on july 19			1
@entity7 went to work as normal the next day , but that night he woke up screaming in excruciating pain			1
his frantic widow , @entity52 , and daughter rushed to his side			0
the stricken @entity7 was taken to @entity54 in @entity55 , where doctors pronounced him dead			2
@entity7 's death was initially attributed to natural causes and his body was laid to rest at @entity60			1
entrepreneur : @entity7 emigrated to the @entity19 during the 1980s , and had saved enough to open three dry cleaning shops ( pictured ) on @entity12 's @entity64 side but within a week of @entity7 's death an unidentified relative phoned the @entity67 ’s office and asked investigators to take another look			1
‘ they had concerns that it was deemed a natural cause of death and wanted us to look harder , ’ medical examiner dr. @entity70 told @entity71			0
when his investigators conducted comprehensive toxicology tests , they found lethal levels of cyanide			1
' it is a very lethal drug , ' @entity82 said			2
' it ’s a chemical poison			0
it basically asphyxiates you at the biochemical level , so a little goes a long way			0
' the @entity89 is now treating @entity7 's death as a homicide and is considering exhuming his body			1
@entity7 emigrated to the @entity19 during the 1980s , and through hard work and discipline , saved sufficiently to open first one and eventually three dry cleaning shops in @entity12			1
the day after receiving a check for his winnings , @entity7 awoke screaming in pain in his bed at his @entity12 home ( pictured ) no signs of foul play : an initial autopsy on @entity7 performed by the @entity105 found nothing awry he opened the first of his stores in 2004 on a stretch of roadway known for its @entity20 and @entity112 restaurants , bakeries and bazaars			1
the hardworking @entity7 personally oversaw the day - to - day operations at all three shops , which counted 10 employees			1
if a worker called in sick , @entity7 reportedly often handled cleaning and delivery duties in the employee 's stead			1
' by @entity125 's grace , he was a workaholic , ' his widow @entity52 told the @entity127			2
' day or night ... he picks up the phone 24/7			2
' he made the clients happy by doing his job			0
he could not be everywhere , but he had to be everywhere			0
' the very fact that he bought the winning lottery ticket represents an ironic - and fateful - misfortune			0
the @entity127 reports that after a 2010 @entity135 pilgrimage to the @entity34 , @entity7 forswore his foible for playing the lotto			2
but he apparently momentarily lost his will when he purchased the two scratch tickets during the summer			0
a good man : the cashier at the 7 - 11 where @entity7 bought his fateful lotto tickets said @entity7 was a ' gentle ' man and a ' nice person ' who cared for his family ' it 's sad			2
but i guess it 's true when they say that money is the root of all evil , ' a cashier at the 7 - 11 told @entity155			2
' he was very nice			0
i would never think that anybody , especially around him and in the family , would hurt him , ' the cashier added			0
' he was a nice person , very helpful , very gentle , a hardworking person			0
i mean , in a short time , he came and managed to have three businesses			0
that tells you what kind of person he was for his family			0
' @entity7 's widow , for her part , refused to be interviewed by @entity168 about her husband 's homicide , other than to say she had cooperated with authorities			1
@entity52 , 32 , to whom @entity7 was married for 12 years , told the paper , though that he was , ' extraordinary , nice , kind and lovable			2
' he was , she said , ' the best husband on the entire planet			0

@entity7 of @entity12 's @entity176 won the prize in june and received his winnings a month later
the very next day @entity7 awoke in his bed , screaming in pain
initial autopsy found no signs of foul play
further testing by @entity188 *reveal* @entity7 died of a lethal dose of cyanide
@entity12 *police* have *re-opened* the case as a homicide
