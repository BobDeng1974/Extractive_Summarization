by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:18 est , 7 september 2012 updated : 06:16 est , 8 september 2012 the head of @entity4 special operations has concluded that the claims made by former @entity8 seal @entity6 about @entity10 's last moments are incorrect and do not convey an accurate assessment of the @entity13 chiefs killing			1
the chief of @entity4 special forces has re-examined the claims of @entity6 , who wrote ' @entity6 ' and recounts a different version of events of the death of @entity10 admiral @entity21 took the personal step of contacting members of the @entity24 that stormed the @entity25 , @entity26 compound of @entity10 , to rebut claims made by @entity28 that contradicted the official account of the may 2011 raid			1
in his book on the raid , ' no easy day ' , @entity28 said that @entity10 was on the floor having already been shot when he and other seals entered his room , having been fired upon by another seal when he craned his head into the hall as the team approached			1
@entity28 's book claims that when he entered the room @entity10 's body was already lying at the foot of the bed , twitching and convulsing and that the @entity34 , including @entity28 shot him in the chest until he was motionless			1
because this version of events differs from the account that the @entity52 and other @entity4 officials have given , adm. @entity45 , the head of @entity4 @entity48 personally went back to the head of @entity24 to examine the contradicting claims			1
following this , senior @entity57 officials told @entity59 that the conclusions they reached were that @entity28 was wrong in his version of events			2
they re-confirmed that the @entity13 leader was standing in his room when the @entity34 entered and they shot him then , as he was able to access weapons that were already in the room			2
despite the fact that @entity10 was unarmed , the @entity34 had come under heavy fire as they made their way through the house to reach him and @entity10 showed no signs of surrendering			1
even though the @entity57 's and @entity28 's versions diverge at the point of encountering @entity10 , the officials who spoke with @entity59 said it was possible that the former seal simply never saw @entity10 standing because he was a few seconds behind the lead team members			1
it still has not been made clear if the initial shots fired by the leading seal member hit @entity10 when he looked out of his room			2
the officials told @entity59 that they believe the shots missed			0
however , whatever the truth of the @entity10 raid , @entity28 's decision to publicly come forward and tell his story has reportedly led to him being ostracised by his former special forces comrades			1
adm. @entity21 took the claims of @entity28 , ( seen in this photo talking to tv show 60 minutes ) so seriously that he went straight to the lead seal of @entity24 to lead another debriefing on the mission having broken ranks , @entity28 will be struck from invitations to annual events for retired and active @entity34 , who act as a secretive and closely knit band of brothers			1
' the guys who run their mouths are typically not invited back to these things , ' a retired senior @entity8 officer familiar with the @entity34 culture told the @entity100			2
' these guys are not really welcomed in many places in the ‘ spec ’ war community			0
the entire @entity34 community has made these guys unwelcomed at their gatherings			2
' another anonymous officer who maintains contacts with serving seals said that ' no easy day ' violated the basic @entity34 creed			1
' they ’re not going to buy the book			0
most of the guys are pissed off [ by ] the fact that he would disclose the operation			0
he claimed to be out to tell the truth on the raid that killed @entity10			0
however , it has also been claimed that @entity28 could actually have been motivated by revenge - on his own comrades			0
a rival book alleges that @entity6 , who wrote ‘ no @entity6 ’ , had ‘ bad blood ’ between his former colleagues and commanders because he was kicked out of the unit			2
‘ no @entity128 ’ claims that the soldier was ‘ ostracised ’ when he inquired about leaving the @entity8 to start a business and was sent home suddenly before quitting			0
the @entity24 member who used the pseudonym @entity134 to write no @entity6 feeling scorned @entity28 could have penned his novel as a way of getting back at the military in which he served for 14 years with distinction			1
no @entity6 , which is in book stores , is the first account of the @entity10 operation from a member of the squad who was there			1
but it has proved controversial because @entity28 , writing under the pseudonym @entity134 , did not seek approval from the authorities before he wrote it			0
it also disagrees with the official @entity52 version of events which was put out at the time and has caused the @entity151 administration consternation			0
according to the @entity153 , the book says that @entity28 was ‘ repaid for his honesty and 14 years of service ’ with nothing but rejection			0
it claims he was ‘ ostracized from his unit with no notice and handed a plane ticket back to @entity162 from a training operation ’ , before eventually leaving			0
the book says : ‘ in the infantry - bred world of @entity168 special operations , no one wants to hear braggarts telling tall tales of their heroics , ’ no @entity128 has been written by @entity172 , a web site for former @entity175 team members			1
@entity176 , a former @entity34 sniper who founded the site , said that the book was the product of conversations he and others had with serving members of the @entity10 team , although none of them are identified			2
talking to the @entity153 , mr @entity176 refused to say whether @entity28 was involved in @entity186 , even though he has spoken to him in the past			0
watching : in this undated image from video seized from @entity10 's compound , the @entity13 chief watches a tv programme showing an image of president @entity151 mission : the @entity13 leader was killed at this compound in @entity25 by @entity197 - and @entity198 claims that if @entity24 had never made it there they were to explain that they were searching for an unmanned drone to their @entity26 allies tension : the raid of @entity10 's @entity25 compound was watched by president @entity151 and his closest advisers in the @entity208 of the @entity52 in a statement , @entity209 , one of the co-authors of @entity6 said : ‘ after spending several very intense months working with @entity134 on this book , i know that he wrote this book solely to share a story about the incredible men and women defending @entity4 all over the world			1
‘ any suggestion otherwise is as ill informed as it is inaccurate			0
‘ what ’s more , @entity134 has an unshakable respect for the @entity4 military , in particular the men he served with			0
‘ that ’s why not one negative word was written about anyone he served with			0
’ this undated file photo shows @entity13 leader @entity10 , in @entity228			0
a firsthand account of the @entity34 raid that killed @entity10 contradicts previous accounts , raising questions as to whether the terror mastermind presented a clear threat when @entity34 first fired upon him			1
