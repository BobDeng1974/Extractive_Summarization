as any expectant mother will tell you , when you 've got to go , you 've got to go			0
fortunately for six months pregnant @entity2 , when nature called she was in a fast food restaurant			1
so while her partner and their friends queued to order and pay for their food , she nipped to the loo			1
but that was when disaster struck			0
for miss @entity2 found herself barred from the @entity15 toilets – because she did n't have a receipt for a meal			1
@entity2 , who is six months pregnant , with partner @entity18 , was barred from a @entity15 toilet she tried pleading with staff , explaining that she was heavily pregnant , but they remained unmoved			1
eventually , with the situation becoming pressing , she had to leave the restaurant and head somewhere else			0
last night miss @entity2 said she had found the whole situation embarrassing and accused @entity15 of ' disgraceful behaviour '			1
the company has now apologised			0
the incident took place at the same @entity15 branch in @entity30 , @entity31 , where in march last year another pregnant woman left in tears after being told she would have to pay £ 1 to use the toilets			1
in miss @entity2 's case , her partner @entity18 and their friends were queuing to order while she rushed to the washrooms			1
but a member of staff said she would not be allowed in until she could show a proof of payment from the tills			0
miss @entity2 was refused entry to the @entity15 toilet in @entity50 , @entity31 ( pictured ) the 31 - year - old said the decision to prevent her using the toilet was ' absolutely disgraceful behaviour ' miss @entity2 said : ' i was furious			1
i pointed out that my friends were in the queue and that i was clearly heavily pregnant , asking for a little leniency , but again i was refused			2
' it 's quite obvious i 'm pregnant and i specifically pointed it out to them			2
but she just said , ' sorry , that 's our policy '			0
as i was unable to use the toilet we had to leave before my partner ordered our lunch			2
' i was left feeling extremely embarrassed at being turned away from using the toilet			0
i found this to be absolutely disgraceful behaviour			1
' i tried to speak to the member of staff serving my friend and they still said there was nothing they could do			0
the whole thing just felt so silly			0
they could see we were waiting			0
while i understand people do come in to use facilities only , my partner could clearly be seen ordering			2
' a @entity15 spokesman said : ' i would like to assure you that all pregnant women , whether they are customers or not , are allowed to use our washrooms at all times			1
' it appears that one of the temporary @entity92 staff was not informed about the policy			1
i have phoned the restaurant manager and discussed this unacceptable situation with him			0
he has assured me he will speak to all his staff to reiterate the company policy on this matter			0
' she said : ' it 's quite obvious i 'm pregnant ' but was denied entry to the toilet because it was company policy			2
