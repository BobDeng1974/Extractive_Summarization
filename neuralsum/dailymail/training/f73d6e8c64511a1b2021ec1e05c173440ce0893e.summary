last month science illustrator @entity0 brought us stunning graphics showing how animals fly			1
and now she ’s at it again with amazing illustrations showing how different animals breathe			2
the fascinating animations show the direction oxygen and carbon dioxide travel in different animals to supply their body with oxygen			1
a @entity14 - based designer has created animations for animals breathing			1
they show how oxygen and carbon dioxide are transported			1
the animations reveal how humans have a two - way system for air			1
but birds have a one - way system ( shown ) , which lets them get ' fresher ' oxygen			1
credit : @entity0 according to the @entity14 - based designer the graphics contain ‘ actual science ’ in showing how animals breathe			1
‘ i picked three species that i thought were particularly awesome , ’ ms @entity0 writes on her website			2
‘ the topic really lends itself to a short looped @entity34 so that was an added plus			0
’ in the animations she revealed that animals have three different ways of breathing			1
the first example uses the example of human lungs to explain how all mammals breathe			0
it shows that humans inhale by moving their diaphragm to			2
this lowers the air pressure in their chest and pulls air into the lungs			0
the process of breathing draws oxygen into the respiratory system through the mouth and nose			1
air sacs in birds allow air to flow in just one direction through their lungs , known as ‘ unidirectional ’			1
this means that air coming through the lungs is mostly fresh and has a high oxygen content			1
in mammals air flow is ‘ bidirectional , ’ which means it moves back and forth into and out of the lungs			0
this means air in a mammal ’s lungs is mixed with ‘ old air ’ , which has less oxygen			2
for this reason , birds are able to fly at a higher altitude than mammals as they can get more oxygen from the thin air			1
source : @entity84 inhaled oxygen passes into the alveoli in the lungs and ultimately diffuses into our blood , which allows cells to produce energy			0
for carbon dioxide the opposite process occurs , with it being pumped out by our lungs			1
in birds , the process of attaining oxygen is somewhat different , as illustrated in the graphic below showing a chicken as an example			2
rather than using a diaphragm , air is moved in and out using pressure changes in air sacs			0
these air sacs are used to store and pump air through the stationary lungs			0
muscles in the chest changes the pressure in the sacs , allowing them to draw air in and out			0
but in birds , air only flows in one direction , so they take in oxygen even when exhaling			2
in simple terms , birds basically breathe in and out at the same time , to make breathing during long flights require minimal effort			0
this structure also means they can breathe at much higher altitudes than humans			0

credit : @entity0 the final animal ms @entity0 looks at is the grasshopper , which transports air around its using tracheal tubes			2
here the grasshopper is used as a representation of all insects			0
they do not have lungs , and instead pump their abdomens to change the volume of their air sacs			0
however saying insets ‘ breathe ’ is a bit of a misnomer as without lungs oxygen is not transported around their circulatory system			1
instead , they use the tracheal system of tubes to move gas around their body			0
when air reaches a small tube called the tracheole , the oxygen dissolves into the tracheole liquid			0
through diffusion it then enters cells , with carbon dioxide moving the other way			1
using muscle contractions , insects can then control their respiration to a limited degree			0
air sacs in birds ( stock image shown ) allow air to flow in just one direction through their lungs , known as ‘ unidirectional ’			2
this means that air coming through the lungs is mostly fresh and has a high oxygen content last month ms @entity0 created animations to show different flight techniques in animals			1
each is composed of 15 frames based on traced body positions of the animals from slow - motion videos			2
specific points on the wings were then marked at each of the 15 frames and connected using imaginary curves			0
this creates the sweeping arcs of colour seen , which track the motion and direction of the wings as they move			0
they reveal how different animals fly with a different profile , and also how wings cope with animals of different sizes			1
ms @entity0 explains that she used a programme called @entity212 to create the animations , based on previous work she performed with larvae			1
last month ms @entity0 created animations to show different flight techniques in animals , shown above			1
each is composed of 15 frames based on traced body positions of the animals from slow - motion videos			2
specific points on the wings were then marked at each of the 15 frames and connected using imaginary curves			0

@entity14 - based designer has created animations for animals breathing
they show how oxygen and carbon dioxide are transported
the animations reveal how humans have a two - way system for air
but birds have a one - way system , which lets them get ' fresher ' oxygen
and designer @entity0 also shows how insects do *n't* have lungs
last month she created animations showing how animals can fly
