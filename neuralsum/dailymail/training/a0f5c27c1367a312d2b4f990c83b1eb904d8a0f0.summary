@entity0 will consider reviving interest in @entity4 left - back @entity2 if they fail to agree a deal for @entity6			1
the @entity8 star has been a long - time target for @entity11 boss @entity10 , but a move to @entity13 appears to have hit the rocks			2
back in the frame : @entity0 could revisit their interest in @entity4 defender @entity2 up for the cup : @entity2 is playing for @entity18 in @entity19 @entity0 thought they had thrashed out terms with the @entity22 side , who have upped their asking price and are now demanding around £ 20million for the 21 - year - old			1
that means @entity10 could turn his attention to @entity28 instead			0
the @entity11 were linked with the 21 - year - old in january , but could reignite their interest if a deal for @entity6 falls through			0
in doubt : @entity0 's move for @entity34 ( right ) has hit the skids			0

@entity11 could move for @entity2 after growing *frustrated* in @entity6 pursuit
@entity8 now demanding around £ 20million for @entity39 star @entity6
@entity10 could revive interest in @entity4 defender @entity2
