@entity0 struck a superb century as @entity1 fought back from the brink to beat @entity3 by three wickets in @entity5 and in the process clinch the one - day international series 3 - 1			1
@entity3 had looked well on course to set up a winner - takes - all decider in @entity11 this weekend when , after making 267 for eight , they reduced @entity1 to 98 for five in the 25th over			0
however , @entity0 had other ideas and his 104 off 112 balls - his second odi hundred - turned the match on its head and took @entity1 to within touching distance of victory			1
@entity1 's @entity0 hit a second century of the series to complete a comeback victory @entity1 players congratulate @entity23 after his single run secured a 3 - 1 odi series win over @entity26 @entity28 batsmen @entity29 ( @entity30 ) and @entity23 celebrate the victory on home soil @entity0 was unable to see the job through , bowled by @entity34 in the penultimate over with the scores level , but new batsman @entity23 got the single @entity1 needed to claim the match - and series - off the next ball , although not without more drama			1
@entity3 thought they had claimed two wickets in two balls when @entity44 appeared to take a stunning one - handed catch off @entity34 to snare @entity23			2
but , after checking replays , it was confirmed the ball had not carried on the full and @entity23 and @entity29 were able to celebrate victory , with the pair having crossed			0
@entity29 's 34 not out off 19 balls was another significant reason for @entity1 's recovery , as was the 52 from @entity54 - the wicketkeeper putting on 121 for the sixth wicket with @entity0			2
that came after @entity3 's bowlers had ripped out half of @entity1 's side for less than 100 as the visitors looked certain to level up the series at 2 - 2			0
@entity0 ( @entity30 ) was bowled out in the penultimate over after hitting 104 runs from 112 balls for @entity1 @entity44 ( @entity30 ) is comforted by @entity65 after his catch off @entity23 was ruled out to concede defeat earlier , captain @entity68 had come close to a 20th odi century to give @entity3 a commanding lead earlier , it was another fine batting display from @entity68 that guided @entity3 to a challenging total after winning the toss			1
the @entity76 skipper made it to within nine runs of a 20th odi ton when he was caught by @entity0 looking to hit a @entity23 slower ball			0
aside from @entity81 , @entity44 contributed 45 and @entity82 28 , with @entity3 's total ultimately proving just not enough thanks to @entity0 's determined century .			0
