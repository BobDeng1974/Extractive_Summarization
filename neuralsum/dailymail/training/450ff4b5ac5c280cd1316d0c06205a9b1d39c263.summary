by @entity0 published : 05:22 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 05:28 est , 6 january 2014 as ice storms battered @entity4 before @entity5 , hundreds of thousands of homeowners were left without power			0
but one man beat the blackout after siphoning off electricity from his car in order to power his home			0
retired @entity14 engineer @entity13 used the battery in his @entity16 to heat his house , power his television and keep his lights on for a whole day on december 21			1
ice storms left hundreds of thousands without power for days in @entity4 , except for one man who managed to power his home using electricity from his car using his three decades of experience as a mechanic working on aircraft and cars he ran a cable from an outlet he fitted to his fireplace , through his basement and into the window of the @entity16			1
speaking to the @entity33 , he said : ' when the furnace comes on , and the house gets up to temperature , i go to the thermostat and shut the furnace off			0
' now i can plug something else in : the tv , the fridge or the floor lamp			0
' he added that by powering just the lights and tv , the traction battery should run for a long time			2
out of the nine hours he used the @entity16 the car 's fuel gauge , measured in bars , went down by less than one bar â€” or roughly four litres ' worth of petrol			1
however he does n't recommend that anyone else try the trick , as it can be incredibly dangerous for someone without his training			2
the @entity16 is a hybrid car with two separate engines - one petrol , and one electric - and uses both a conventional fuel tank and a battery to power itself according to his daughter @entity63 , @entity13 has always been handy with cars , and in the 1960s while stationed in @entity66 he invented his own automatic car starter to stop the cold damaging the engine			1
the motor would run for ten minutes every hour in order to keep the car warm so the engine would n't make a grinding noise as it started			0
however , @entity63 added that she had no idea of her father 's plans during the storm			0
@entity13 says he plans to keep the car on a full charge in case the power goes out again			2
the father added that he had driven a diesel @entity83 for over a decade and only switched to a @entity16 a few years ago in the hope of getting better mileage .			1

retired engineer @entity13 powered his house for nine hours
wired @entity16 battery up to an outlet he fitted to his fireplace
then switched between heating , lights and television to save *energy*
however he has warned others not to try the trick as it can be dangerous
