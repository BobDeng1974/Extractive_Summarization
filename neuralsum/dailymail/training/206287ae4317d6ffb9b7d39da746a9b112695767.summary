the @entity1 ' will be proud ' to be the head of state for an independent @entity3 , @entity0 claimed today			1
the first minister said he had an audience at @entity6 two weeks ago but would not reveal what was discussed			1
speaking in @entity8 today he dismissed press reports that the @entity1 is ‘ concerned ’ about the prospect of @entity3 independence , adding : ‘ i want the @entity1 as head of state , as @entity1 of @entity3 of an independent @entity3 as her ancestors were			1
‘ i think @entity14 , who has seen so many events in the course of her long reign , will be proud to be @entity1 of @entity3 , and indeed we would be proud to have her as monarch of this land			1
’ it came after prince @entity22 urged voters to concentrate on important ' domestic news ' following yesterday 's revelation that his wife , the @entity26 , was pregnant			2
senior mps from all parties have said that the prime minister should consider asking the @entity1 to speak out against breaking up the union			1
she has until now maintained an absolute silence on the issue of independence			0
the nearest she has come to passing comment was in her 1977 @entity49 speech , delivered as @entity3 and @entity50 were voting on devolved national assemblies			1
in the address she reminded subjects of the ' benefits which union has conferred , at home and in our international dealings , on the inhabitants of all parts of the @entity61			2
' mr @entity0 said he had an audience with the @entity1 at @entity6 two weeks ago and praised the @entity64 's neutrality			1
he said : ‘ and i think the statement from the @entity64 about the @entity1 's neutrality in this matter is a perfectly satisfactory and perfectly sensible one			2
‘ and , of course , one thing that the polls showed at the weekend , in addition to the substantial move to the @entity34 campaign , is the enthusiasm of the people of @entity3 to have @entity14 as our queen of @entity3			0
’ @entity3 first minister @entity0 today insisted the @entity1 would be ' proud ' to be the head of state for an independent @entity3 a senior @entity80 mp told @entity81 : ' now would be a great moment for the @entity1 to say again and underline those inspiring words that she gave in 1977 at her @entity49			1
the referendum looks extremely close and her intervention could make all the difference			0
' although the @entity1 is assumed to back the union , under her constitutional role she must stay politically neutral and such an intervention would be highly unlikely and constitutionally unthinkable , according to palace sources			1
in the speech she said : ‘ i number kings and queens of @entity94 and of @entity3 , and princes of @entity50 among my ancestors and so i can readily understand these aspirations			2
‘ but i can not forget that i was crowned @entity98 of @entity99 and @entity100			0
‘ perhaps this jubilee is a time to remind ourselves of the benefits which union has conferred , at home and in our international dealings , on the inhabitants of all parts of this @entity61			0
’ the @entity1 is the most @entity3 sovereign in the history of the @entity61 , directly descended from @entity1 , while the late queen mother - daughter of the @entity112 - was twice descended from @entity113			1
senior mps from all parties have said that the prime minister should consider asking the @entity1 to speak out against breaking up the union her love of @entity3 is also widely documented			1
she spent much of her childhood there , her late sister @entity121 was born there , and those close to the @entity1 note that she is ' never happier than when at @entity6 '			2
@entity124 , a former policy adviser to the queen and now a @entity80 mp , said it was the place where the royals had time to switch off from their official duties			0
' it is where they relax , it goes back to their childhood			0
' her only official comment on the referendum came in may in a message to the @entity139			0
' in this important year of referendum , we pray that whatever the outcome , people of faith and people of good will , will work together for the social good of @entity3 , ' she said			0
she is , however , said to be privately concerned at the surge in support for @entity3 independence and is said to have asked aides for daily updates on the progress of the campaign			1
a senior royal source claimed : ‘ the queen is a unionist ... there is now a great deal of concern			0
’ the source added : ‘ if there is a ‘ yes ’ vote , that puts us into uncharted territory constitutionally			0
her being @entity1 of @entity3 is not a given			2
’ senior palace aides are increasingly concerned that the @entity1 will be thrown into the centre of a constitutional crisis in the event of a ‘ yes ’ vote on september 18			1
although the queen is assumed to back the union , under her constitutional role she must stay politically neutral and palace sources say that a speech similar to that delivered in 1977 would be constitutionally unthinkable today experts have suggested she may be forced to appoint an @entity180 - style ‘ governor general ’ to rule in her name			1
@entity182 leader @entity0 has insisted that the @entity1 will remain head of state in an independent @entity3			1
but his party is split on the issue			0
the @entity187 ’s @entity186 has called for a referendum to replace the monarch as head of state in @entity3 after the @entity1 steps down or dies			1
he said : ‘ the present queen is very popular , but the mood of society may change when she leaves the throne			0
’ @entity3 justice secretary @entity195 has also raised the prospect this year of a referendum on the @entity198			0
he said it was ‘ for the people of @entity3 to decide ’ on the @entity1 ’s role			2
prime minister @entity28 is currently with the @entity1 in @entity6 , @entity202 , and is expected to hold talks over the crisis			2
mr @entity28 has travelled alone without his wife @entity205			0
as news broke yesterday that the @entity26 is expecting again , prince @entity22 suggested the growing threat of @entity3 independence was more important than the news of his wife 's pregnancy			1
the @entity212 said @entity26 , who is suffering acute morning sickness , was ‘ feeling okay ’ after a ‘ tricky few days ’			0
but in a move that could be seen as a direct @entity216 intervention on the independence debate , he added : ‘ it ’s important that we all focus on the big news and the big international and domestic things that are going on at the moment			0
that ’s what my thoughts are at the moment			0

@entity0 insists @entity1 would be ' proud ' to be @entity3 's head of state

but she used 1977 @entity49 speech to praise the benefits of the union
@entity242 said to be privately concerned at support for @entity3 independence
she is directly descended from @entity1 and @entity113
