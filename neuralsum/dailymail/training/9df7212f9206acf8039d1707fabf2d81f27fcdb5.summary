@entity0 featured @entity1 on its frontispiece after a letter from her fiance @entity4 @entity0 's legendary ' girls in @entity6 ' are often the daughters of the aristocracy			1
so this month 's frontispiece , personal trainer @entity1 – and especially the manner in which she was chosen for the slot – makes a refreshing change for the 117 - year - old magazine			1
the former @entity14 officer , 29 , was picked when her fiancé – a squadron leader – contacted the magazine 's editor after being wounded by a bullet during a tour of @entity20			1
in a heartfelt letter , @entity4 , 32 , explained what it would mean to have his fiancée in the quintessentially @entity27 magazine 's pages and an unlikely plot was hatched by its editor			1
secret arrangements were made for a three - day photoshoot in rural @entity32 and miss @entity1 was whisked away and given a makeover			2
she told the @entity35 : ' it was a bit of a shock when i ﬁrst found out what he had done but i am always up for trying these things			0
' it was amazing , all a bit overwhelming but really good fun			0
they were really nice people and the weather from the ﬁrst day was really nice so it was great to be involved – and @entity4 loves it , which is the most important thing			2
' @entity50 said : ' the mere sight of @entity1 takes me back to those timeless frontispiece girls in pearls			2
@entity1 and i stand for , our love for the country , the countryside , to keep this country protected and great for future generations seem to be embodied in @entity0			1
' mr @entity4 added that he had ordered the magazine for his unit – 27 squadron @entity14 – during its tour of duty in the wartorn country because it ' gave us all a tangible link with home – no mean feat given we were in a war zone 4,000 miles away '			1
already a devoted reader , he said he found it especially comforting during the months he spent recovering from a @entity73 bullet that hit him above the eye			0
the @entity76 pilot was injured while ﬂying wounded soldiers back to @entity78 in 2010 and won the @entity79 for his bravery as a result			0
flight lieutenant @entity4 was presented with the @entity79 by the @entity82 after he was injured while flying wounded soldiers back to @entity78 , @entity20 in 2010 @entity83 , the magazine 's editor , said mr @entity4 's letter was so moving that he immediately made arrangements to feature miss @entity1			1
he said : ' when i got that letter from @entity4 it just melted my heart			2
here was a guy who had been injured in @entity20 and the first thing his team bought him in hospital were his pyjamas and a copy of @entity0			0
' we send a lot of issues to @entity20 and at one point they were using it as a way to teach the interpreters @entity27			0
' it is heartening to know that image of the green and pleasant land which is captured by the magazine still strikes a chord with our servicemen and women abroad			0
' famously known as the ' girls in @entity6 ' page because many of its early debutante models wore pearls , it aims to show upper class @entity119 rural life in its most ideal light			0
the pair , who live near @entity123 , @entity124 , will marry later this month in @entity32			0
flight lieutenant @entity50 ( left ) said he and @entity126 ( right ) share a love of the magazine , which was one of the first things given to him by his comrades as he recovered from his injury			1
