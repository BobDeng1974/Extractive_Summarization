by @entity1 reporter published : 15:59 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 16:08 est , 10 may 2013 investigators have gathered ' mounting evidence ' that suggest the @entity6 bomber brothers could have been involved in a grisly unsolved triple murder in 2011 , it has emerged			1
officials told @entity9 that forensic evidence could tie @entity11 and @entity12 to the killings of @entity14 , @entity14 and @entity14 , who were found with their throats slit and marijuana dumped over their dead bodies in a @entity21 , @entity20 house			1
the @entity22 knew the men as @entity11 trained in boxing and martial arts with @entity26 however , officials said more dna testing is required before bringing an indictment against the surviving brother , @entity30 , who is recovering from a self - inflicted gun wound in a prison infirmary			1
involved ? @entity34 , left , and @entity12 , right , could have been involved in a 2011 triple murder , investigators have said			1
forensic evidence and cell phone records reportedly tie them to the scene following the april 15 bombings and the suspected involvement of the @entity12 brothers , investigators began to look into the link between @entity43			1
authorities have now told @entity9 that forensic evidence from the crime scene in 2011 matches the @entity12 brothers			1
their cell phones were also in the area at the time of the killings , records show			1
victim : @entity11 's best friend , @entity14 , had his throat slit in an attack in september 2011 the three men had ordered food from an @entity59 restaurant on the september 11 , 2011 , but when a delivery woman came to leave the food , no one answered the door			1
the next morning , one of the victim 's girlfriends found their bodies			2
their throats had been slit , they have been covered with marijuana and there was also $ 5,000 cash in the home			0
initially police said two other people had been there on the day and they were looking to question them , although no one has ever been charged			0
@entity78 said there had been no forced entry , so police believe the killer was known the victim and was let into the apartment			0
investigators at the time said the murders were ' targeted and not a random act of violence			2
' @entity91 district attorney @entity90 issued a statement soon after the murders saying , ' based on the present state of the investigation , it is believed that the victims knew the assailant or assailants , and the attacks were not random			0
' neighbors described mess and his two roommates as quiet , nice people who were a welcome change of pace from previous residents who often had loud parties late into the evening			0
murdered : @entity14 ( left with a friend ) and @entity14 ( right ) were also killed in the home scene : investigators said there was no sign of forced entry so it is likely the men knew their murderers after the deaths , friends said that @entity11 acted oddly - failing to attend his close friend 's funeral and dropping out of the martial arts school where they had both trained			1
one man who knew @entity11 through the gym where they trained said some of their social circle ' without even speaking about it beforehand have all been thinking ' he could be involved			2
the friend , who gave his name only as @entity78 , told @entity134 : ' at the time , none of us would have thought it was @entity138			0
it was just so emotional and we thought we had someone else who had done it			0
' but since @entity11 was identified as the suspect in the @entity144 bombings that killed three and injured 180 , @entity78 believes his sudden disappearance after @entity14 's death may be a clue			1
@entity148 : @entity149 , fifth from left , top row , poses with his team at 2010 @entity153 in @entity154 , @entity20 he boxed with @entity14 before the murders quiet guy : @entity11 's ( left ) former coach described him as a subdued , nice young man who kept to himself ' @entity138 was n't there at the memorial service , he was n't at the funeral , he was n't around at all , ' @entity78 said			1
' and he was really close with @entity14			2
that 's why it 's so weird			0
' @entity11 was killed following a gunbattle with police , a day after the @entity166 released images of him and his younger brother at the @entity144			2
they allegedly dumped two pressure cooker bombs crammed with shrapnel and detonated them near the finish line , killing three people , including an eight - year - old boy , and injuring 180 more			0
