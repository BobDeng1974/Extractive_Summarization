@entity0 said some pupils were ' a little more than obsessed ' with computer games a primary school headteacher - fed up with sleepy pupils - has written an open letter to parents warning of the dangers of online gaming and allowing late night television in bedrooms after children in her school were ' ready for bed ' by midday			1
@entity0 , headteacher at @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , wrote a letter on the school website addressed to ' parents , carers and children '			1
in the letter she claims some pupils were ' a little more than obsessed ' with computer games and admitted to playing them ' late into the night '			0
the letter goes on : ' this lack of sleep becomes cumulative and it is very difficult for staff to inspire learning from children who by 12 o'clock are ready to go to sleep			1
' she adds that the teachers are greeted with ' tired looks ' in the morning			0
mrs @entity0 also highlights the problem with allowing children having televisions in their rooms : ' as more children have televisions in their rooms , we are finding that some are also watching tv until late			1
' she also writes to parents directly : ' obviously , we can only talk to children about good habits and about the need for a definitive amount of sleep at their age			2
' we need cooperation of parents and carers to ensure that all our children arrive at school in the best possible frame of mind for learning			1
' @entity61 from @entity17 and @entity63 @entity62 said parents needed to take action			2
she said : ' there is a huge danger with online games			0
' there are all sorts of things online especially if these children are accessing it in their bedrooms			0
' and in the virtual reality world they lose out on interacting with others			0
if there is no discipline in the home how will they get on in later life ? in her letter to parents she warned of the dangers of online gaming and allowing late night television in bedrooms after children at @entity16 , @entity91 , were ' ready to go to sleep ' by midday mrs @entity0 urged parents to ' shut down computers and television at a reasonable time ' ' everyone needs to hear ' no ' at some point			1
' the news comes after another primary school in @entity102 issues a warning to parents about children playing in violent video games			2
@entity107 in @entity108 said last month that children as young as seven or eight were acting out on - screen violence in the playground			0
primary school children range from age 4 to 11			2
it has come to my attention that some of our older pupils are a little more than obsessed with various computer games			0
some are admitting to playing these late into the night , especially the ' live ' versions on line , hence the extremely tired looks we are greeted with in the mornings			0
this lack of sleep becomes cumulative and it is very difficult for staff to inspire learning from children who by 12 o'clock are ready to go to sleep			1
as more children have televisions in their rooms , we are finding that some are also watching tv until late			0
it is also affecting punctuality for a few pupils who are simply not waking up early enough to get here on time			0
they have n't realised the need for a time gap between playing a game or watching tv , and settling to sleep			2
obviously , we can only talk to children about good habits and about the need for a definitive amount of sleep at their age			2
we need cooperation of parents and carers to ensure that all our children arrive at school in the best possible frame of mind for learning			1
we therefore ask that you monitor use of tv and games and ensure that they are shutting them down at a reasonable time			1
this is particularly important for year 6 from now on as they need to be fully focused during the day			0
i empathise with parents and carers , having gone through many battles of wills with my own children - they wo n't thank you for it at the time , but they will later .			1
