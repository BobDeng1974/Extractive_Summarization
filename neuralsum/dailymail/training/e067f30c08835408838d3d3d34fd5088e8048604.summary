@entity0 was just 21 when he announced himself to his new @entity2 team - mates by taking @entity4 's usual seat on the @entity6 team coach and refusing to budge when the club 's greatest - ever player told him to at @entity9			1
when it comes to rubbing up people the wrong way , @entity10 is world - class			2
but when he performs like he has done in @entity17 's last three games , it is a price managers consider worth paying			1
@entity10 , now 27 , would say he 's maturing			1
with high - profile fall - outs in the past with sir @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity2 fans and @entity26 media , you 'd hope so			2
@entity10 scored a stunning opener for @entity17 in their @entity29 win against @entity30 @entity10 ( passing to @entity31 ) refused to get out of @entity4 's ( right ) seat on the @entity6 team bus @entity10 ( next to @entity4 and @entity34 ) has a confrontational style which wo n't change @entity37 's less confrontational style appears to suit @entity10 just fine though			1
as @entity17 have been forced to cope without their fab four @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity10 is one of those who has thrived on the extra responsibility and a major reason the club have qualified for the knockout stages of the @entity29 and on @entity48 's shoulder at the top of the @entity50			1
after a poor start to the season , @entity10 stepped up a gear in the 4 - 1 win at @entity55 , playing a central no 10 role with such creativity , @entity40 was n't missed			2
he followed up with a man - of - the - match performance at the weekend when @entity17 beat @entity59 1 - 0 and saved his best until wednesday night when his wonder - strike opened the scoring in a 2 - 0 win in @entity30 which confirmed @entity17 's place among @entity66 's top 16 clubs			1
@entity10 compared the goal , his first of the season			2
in importance with his @entity71 final winner against @entity55 last season			0
if @entity17 go on to achieve anything in @entity66 , it will be far more significant than that having looked down - and - out in the group stages after taking only two points from their opening four matches			2
' it was a great strike , i should try it more , ' smiled the @entity26			2
' in the past few weeks we have been back to our best and shown we are team			0
when @entity39 , @entity83 and @entity41 are not there , i do n't think any other team could do it			0
we have shown the world we are a big team			0
' ' it is always the way with @entity17 , we like to do it the hard way			0
' the outspoken @entity10 and girlfriend @entity92 ( pictured at a @entity17 charity event ) both polarise opinion @entity10 ( pictured on wednesday ) has started to consistently perform for the @entity50 champions doing it the hard way has always been @entity10 's personal experience , too			1
born and raised in the tough southern @entity26 city of @entity100 , he says and does what he thinks			0
@entity4 found that out when @entity10 joined @entity2			0
so did @entity103 when @entity10 decided to leave the club , so did @entity22 who was convinced @entity10 would sign for @entity106 until they were gazumped by @entity17			1
a return of 23 goals in 144 games for @entity17 is not a high enough return for someone of the @entity26 's talent			1
the @entity26 's slipped ball through to @entity41 at @entity55 showed his immense vision on the ball @entity17 manager @entity37 's cool attitude has helped @entity10 rediscover his form but the way he has stepped in for @entity40 has been stunning , to the extent that @entity37 ca n't leave him out now			1
his slide - rule pass for @entity41 's second goal against @entity55 underlined his vision			0
his performance as a second striker behind @entity41 against @entity59 showed his versatility			0
and his goal in @entity127 proves he can hit a ball when he wants to			0
his rising shot from an angle could n't have been better placed as it crashed in via the inside of the post			0
you 'll never be able to take the controversy away from @entity10 , whether it 's swearing at the @entity26 media in a mixed zone at @entity138 or telling @entity2 fans they are ' stupid ' to boo him because players do n't feel the same loyalty to clubs as supporters			1
only this week , @entity10 – who signed a five - year contract in the summer – warned he would n't stick around at @entity17 if the club did n't see him as an important part of their plans			1
given his recent form , there 's not much chance of that .			0

@entity10 scored in @entity17 's win against @entity30 on wednesday
the @entity26 is beginning to turn in consistent performances
@entity10 is known for being a *problem* player but has *unquestioned* talent
