when it comes to four - wheel grand prix racing , @entity1 ’s future looks in good hands			1
@entity6 is the formula one world champion , and judging by the form he showed to win the @entity11 @entity10 , he looks in good shape to become the first ever @entity1 driver to retain his title			1
but glance towards two - wheel grand prix racing and you will find @entity1 is still dining off championships and even race wins from the late great @entity19			1
@entity1 's @entity20 will be riding for the @entity22 team during the 2015 @entity10 season @entity20 hopes to hit the front of the @entity10 grid with @entity22 after a disappointing year with @entity26 @entity10 has arrived in @entity27 to kick off the 2015 season on sunday , and while @entity1 is looking for its first premier class victory since @entity19 triumphed in @entity30 in 1981 – its future also looks intriguingly bright			1
year 2014 2013 2012 2011 team @entity26 @entity33 @entity33 @entity33 placing 13th ( 74 pts ) 5th ( 188 pts ) 7th ( 151 pts ) 12th ( 70 pts ) in fact , the talent coming through is arguably showing greater promise than that seen in @entity38 right now			1
@entity39 , 24 , and @entity40 , 22 , impressed during 2014 and will be targeting podium finishes as a realistic possibility this season			1
for @entity20 , he ’s been there before – often narrowly missing out on the top step of the podium in 2013			1
but following a terrible season at @entity26 last year , the @entity47 born star once again looks in a position where he could sneak on an opportunity to end @entity1 ’s 34 - year wait for a premier class race win			1
in 2015 , @entity20 will be on a @entity22 bike not too far off the specification ridden by double world champion @entity56 , who dominated the 2014 campaign after winning the opening 10 races on his factory @entity22			1
@entity20 tests his @entity22 around @entity62 's @entity61 during a pre-season test for his new team the @entity65 has also been testing at @entity27 's @entity68 circuit - posting impressive lap times riding for the satellite @entity22 outfit , race wins are not expected but they certainly wo n’t be ruled out			1
it ’s very much the same scenario that @entity20 was in at @entity74 ’s @entity33 team in 2012 and 2013 and one the 29 - year - old is aiming to return to			1
‘ so many guys could get on the podium			2
‘ there are 15 guys that are all so close at the moment			2
‘ i ’d like to say my chances of getting on the podium are more than they were last year			0
if i could get back to where i was in 2013 and 2012 , i ’d be quite happy because we were competitive enough there when i finished fifth and seventh in the championship			0
there ’s a positive tone to his voice and a calmness to him which suggests he is much happier now than when i spoke to him at @entity95 last august , shortly after his @entity26 departure following just one season was confirmed			1
@entity26 was always going to be a tough monster to tame			2
even the great @entity99 gave up on the bike following two highly uncompetitive years			0
@entity20 reflects that while he has no resentment towards the team , he was constantly on the back foot following a big crash in just his second race on the @entity106			2
' the @entity108 crash wrecked the season for me , ' @entity20 added			1
' from that point on it was a downward spiral because i was riding injured for a long time but up until @entity114 i was riding good and was really confident			0
@entity20 rides his @entity26 around @entity115 during practice for last year 's grand prix @entity20 would on to clinch third behind @entity118 ( left ) and race winner @entity119 during the @entity10 at @entity115 late in the season which would prove to be his only podium with @entity26 ‘ when i crashed at @entity114 , it was through no fault of my own			1
it was of the biggest crashes that i ’ve ever had when i really hurt my hand but i came back too soon			0
the other two @entity26 riders were riding really well at the time and it was like a double whammy			2
‘ we came back towards the end of the season and we started to ride very strongly , but i enjoyed my time at @entity26 and they look to be doing a great job this year			1
’ @entity20 referred to the testing times that saw @entity136 top the time sheets in a pre-season @entity27 test , but it ’s not just the @entity142 outfit that are on resurgence			1
having ridden much of 2014 injured , @entity20 states that he is going into the new season with no problems and that includes on his unfamiliar @entity22 where he aims to get more potential out of a bike which has already produced encouraging testing times in @entity62			1
‘ i feel good , i feel strong and my physical condition is no problem			0
but racing a motorcycle is one of the most physically demanding sports in the world and people do n’t really realise that			0
‘ it ’s more than twisting the throttle and braking			0
we have average heart rates of 192 - @entity162 over 45 minutes			0
‘ when i was at @entity74 it was different [ learning a new bike ]			0
i was coming from @entity165 and the bike was completely different to anything i knew at all			0
the second and third years were quite similar to where i am now			0
@entity20 has previously mixed with the top guns in @entity10 , finishing second behind @entity56 ( centre ) and @entity99 ( right ) in the @entity170 at the @entity171 while with @entity74 crutchlow claimed four podium finishes with @entity74 in 2013 including a second place at @entity175 @entity20 lifts the front wheel of his @entity74 during a 2013 pre-season test at @entity178 ‘ last year was a little tougher for me to get used to the @entity26 , but i was still quite confident even then			1
‘ i ‘ ve been happy enough with my testing times , but i have n’t taken advantage enough of the new tyre which i thought i would take			0
but that ’s just the way it is			0
the @entity22 you do n’t take advantage as much as you would with the other bikes			2
‘ but learning to ride the bike is more important			2
it ’s been encouraging , the long run i did in @entity62 was ok , and of course i did n’t do the long run in @entity27 because of the rain			2
’ the subject of the @entity1 @entity10 comes up			1
considering @entity95 is a venue where @entity20 ’s crashes see him visit the medical centre more than the podium in recent times , even he can admit that the circuit stepping in for the next two years to cover for the lagging @entity203 project is a good thing			2
@entity95 is the familiar home of the @entity1 @entity10 in @entity38 , but the circuit has also stepped in to replace @entity206 and the @entity207 to host @entity10 for the next two years ‘ it ’s good			1
it should never have left us - not when there is not a circuit to go to			0
@entity95 have put is so much time and effort to get us there in the first place and they really listened to the riders			0
‘ then they said it was going to @entity206 because the @entity207 was not built and i did n’t think that was right			0
they might as well have kept it at @entity95 so it ’s good to be back there			0
' so with a @entity1 @entity10 in place ( where an impressive 138,000 fans attended over the 2014 weekend ) and talent clearly coming through the system – why has @entity1 struggled so badly to find a premier class winner ? with a hint of frustration , @entity20 states that the money being poured into @entity10 over in @entity142 and @entity233 is harming the opportunity for @entity235 to land top rides			1
‘ we do n’t get the opportunity			0
there ’s been no @entity1 riders on factory bikes			2
the year i was in a factory team , the bike was n’t capable of winning , we saw that			0
there ’s not been a chance to get on a factory @entity22 or @entity74 when it ’s winning and that ’s down to the system i feel			2
‘ there ’s not enough money going to the riders like there is in @entity142 and @entity233 , and it ’s just endless			0
’ the 2015 @entity10 season gets underway on 29th march in @entity27 , you can watch this race and all the other action throughout the year exclusively live only on @entity257			1
