our most common male ancestor , ‘ @entity0 ’ , has finally got his original birthdate – and its 9,000 years earlier than scientists believed			1
@entity6 researchers claim that ‘ @entity0 ’ walked the earth 209,000 years ago , contradicting a recent study that suggested the y chromosome predated humanity			1
their findings puts ' @entity0 ' within the timeframe of his other half ' eve ' , the genetic maternal ancestor of mankind			1
our most common male ancestor walked the earth 209,000 years ago - earlier than scientists commonly thought - according to new research from the @entity20 the study , conducted by dr @entity22 from the @entity20 and dr @entity23 from the @entity24 , claims to put ‘ @entity0 ’ in his rightful place in evolutionary history			1
the team dated ‘ @entity0 ’ using existing genetic data			1
to calculate the age of the y chromosome they multiplied data on the average age that fathers have their first child with the number of mutations of they uncovered			1
the team dated ' @entity0 ' using conventional biological models to identify private , derived gene mutations on this lineage results of a separate study announced in august last year suggest that @entity0 lived in @entity45 at the same time - but probably never met			1
it was previously believed that ‘ @entity48 ’ and ‘ @entity49 ’ - the most recent common ancestors to males and females - lived at completely different times			0
but a study of 69 men from around the world found ‘ @entity48 ’ walked the @entity56 between 120,000 and 156,000 years ago , much earlier than previously believed			2
it places him nearer to eve who was around 99,000 to 148,000 years ago the analysis found			0
the researchers at @entity62 , @entity63 , say it is ‘ extremely unlikely ’ they were exact contemporaries			0
initial estimates for the male @entity66 ranged from between 50,000 to 115,000 years ago			0
geneticist professor @entity67 , of @entity62 , @entity63 , said : ' previous research has indicated the male most recent common ancestor ( @entity66 ) lived much more recently than the female @entity66			0
but now our research shows there is no discrepancy			0
' they then divided this figure by the mutation rate of the y chromosome – or how many years it took on average for the mutation to appear			1
‘ of course , we can manipulate each one of these variables to make a finding look younger or older , ’ dr @entity22 told @entity83			0
‘ in our paper , we showed the previous study manipulated all these variable to predate the y chromosome			2
’ ‘ we can say with some certainty that modern humans emerged in @entity45 a little over 200,000 years ago , ’ he added			0
‘ it is obvious that modern humans did not interbreed with hominins living over 500,000 years ago			0
it is also clear that there was no single “ @entity0 ” and “ eve ” but rather groups of “ @entity99 ” and “ @entity100 ” living side by side and wandering together in our world			1
’ a study at @entity106 claimed the human y chromosome originated in a different species through interbreeding which dates ' @entity0 ' to be twice as old a study at @entity106 claimed the human y chromosome originated from a different species through interbreeding which dates ' @entity0 ' to be twice as old			1
dr @entity22 added : ‘ we have shown that the @entity106 study lacks any scientific merit			2
‘ in fact , their hypothesis creates a sort of “ space - time paradox ” whereby the most ancient individual belonging to @entity123 species has not yet been born			2
‘ if we take the numerical results from previous studies seriously we can conclude that the past may be altered by the mother of “ @entity0 ” deciding not to conceive him in the future , thus , bringing a retroactive end to our species			2
‘ think of the movie @entity133 , when @entity134 was worried that his parents would not meet and as a result he would n't be born - it 's the same idea			0
‘ the question to what extend did our humans forbearers interbreed with their closest relatives is one of the hottest questions in anthropology that remains open			0

to calculate age of the y chromosome , researchers multiplied data on age fathers have their first child with the number of mutations they uncovered
they then divided this figure by the mutation rate of the y chromosome
their findings suggest that ' @entity0 ' lived in the same time frame as ' eve '
earlier study at @entity106 claimed y chromosome originated in a different species through interbreeding and dated ' @entity0 ' to be twice as old
