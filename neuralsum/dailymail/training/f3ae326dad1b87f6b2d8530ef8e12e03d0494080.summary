exhausted , covered in mud and desperately hungry , a team of @entity3 athletes sat down for a meal as they prepared to take on a dangerous 20 - mile trek through the @entity7 rainforest			1
as they opened their canned meat , a tired @entity8 noticed a scruffy , miserable stray dog staring at him out of the corner of his eye			1
feeling sorry for him , he fed the dog a meatball and thought nothing of it , but as the team stood up to continue their race the animal started to follow them - and he did n't stop			1
as the group of four navigated the final two stages of the 430 - mile @entity24 , the dog befriended them and was eventually given the name @entity26			1
every grueling task the team face , @entity26 would do the same			2
he swam alongside them while they kayaked down rivers , dragged himself up hills during hikes and pulled through knee - deep mud during treks			0

he followed the group of four during the grueling race all terrains : despite numerous attempts by the team to get rid of the dog , primarily for his own safety , he refused to go			1
it meant when he got stuck in the knee - deep mud they helped get him out and when he was exhausted , they stopped to take a break encounter : @entity8 first noticed the scruffy dog when he was sitting down to eat canned meatballs			2
he fed @entity26 one thinking nothing on it , but ended up creating a bond with the dog this meant when he was tired they stopped for a break and when he got stuck in the mud they pulled him out			2

but @entity26 swam alongside the boat and ended up being pulled in by @entity76 grueling : the race takes teams of four around ten days , and involves continuous hiking , trekking , mountain biking and kayaking resting : when the team slept @entity26 would also curl up and take a nap alongside them @entity125 ' i thought he was hungry and gave him a meatball			2
then i thought no more of it			0
he added : ' at one stage we had to take a break and the dog was totally wrecked			0
we opened two cans of food and let him eat , because he could find no food at all in the jungle			0
' before one of the segments of the race - a 36 mile kayak around the coast - organizers warned the team that taking @entity26 along posed a risk to his and their safety			1
they tried to set off without him , but as they left he jumped into the water beside them and started desperately paddling			0
@entity76 , heartbroken by the site of @entity26 struggling in the water , picked him up , put him in the kayak and let him stay for the rest of the journey			2
the gesture prompted a standing ovation and cheers from spectators watching from the banks			0

' support : at one point the dog was not able to find any food in the jungle , so the team stopped and gave him some of their canned food challenge : as the team neared the finished the tasks began to take their toll on @entity26 and he ended up with some injuries health checks : when the team finished the race , they took @entity26 to @entity7 to see a vet in order to prepare him for the trip back to @entity3 donations : @entity43 set up a @entity201 account while they were still in @entity75 to garner funds for @entity26 's care spotlight : team member @entity205 takes @entity26 for a walk outside the clinic			1
their story had already grabbed the attention of the media greeting : @entity26 offers out his paw to one of the vets as the team wait in the clinic for him to be checked over aftermath : after the procedures were complete he was forced to wear a cone on his head			0
