@entity11 wants to decorate the fuselage and use it as a seating area for customers to wait in while their food is prepared			2
the young businessman bought the jet as a gift for his aircraft - loving father and to grab the attention of staff at the nearby @entity42 factory			1
tight squeeze : @entity11 , 18 , bought the unusual £ 5,000 shop display to impress his father @entity45 , 28 , who is a big fan of planes @entity47 removed : the window of the restaurant in @entity19 is taken out to get the fuselage inside he said : ' @entity42 employs thousands of staff nearby and many of them have to pass my takeaway each day so i thought attract more business			1
' i did n’t do the measurements but i was confident it would fit , now we will have to get it in - i hope everything will be sorted over the next month			0
' the idea is for people to sit inside the fuselage and admire it while they wait for their food			2
