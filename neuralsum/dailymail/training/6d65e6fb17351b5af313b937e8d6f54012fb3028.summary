miracle baby : @entity2 , pictured with her 18 - week - old baby @entity17 who she did n't know she was pregnant with , after suffering a miscarriage and taking abortion pills kisses ! when @entity2 went in for an operation on her uterus , doctors found a heartbeat			1
@entity25 was born in february weighing just under 6lbs and is now thriving at 18 weeks old but as doctors prepared to perform this final procedure , a scan picked up a tiny heartbeat			1
the astonished medical team told mrs @entity2 that her baby had managed to survive both the miscarriage and the abortion pills – and she could continue with the pregnancy			1
they said she had been pregnant with twins , and while one baby died , the other had clung on to life			1
the blood clots could have created shadows on the scan images , obscuring the surviving foetus from view , doctors said			2
in february mrs @entity2 , 31 , and her husband @entity46 , 33 , welcomed their ‘ miracle ’ daughter @entity17 into the family			1
weighing a healthy six pounds , she has continued to thrive at home with her sister @entity51 , four , and brother @entity52 , two			2
the family have since been told that @entity17 ’s story is so extraordinary that it has been written up in medical journals			0
mrs @entity2 said : ‘ the miscarriage and abortion were absolutely horrific			1
the ten days between the miscarriage and going back to the hospital were just a blur			2
‘ but then i saw this little heartbeat			2
i thought it could n’t be right			0
after all we had been through , i did n’t want to get my hopes up			0
the doctor went out and came back in with a more senior doctor and he did the scan again and he said , “ you are not going to believe it , we ’ve got a heartbeat ”			1
it was the best feeling ever			0
‘ now @entity17 is fine			0
she is just a big healthy pudding of a baby			2
the doctors said it was a blessing			0
they have never heard of anything like it			0
someone had been looking over us			0
’ she was six weeks pregnant when she began bleeding as she walked to work , and feared she was suffering a miscarriage			1
she went to hospital where two different doctors had carried out five scans before concluding she had lost her baby			2
she was given two abortion drugs – known as a medical abortion because it does not involve surgery – to prompt her womb to expel the dead foetus to prevent any infection			0
further tests showed there were blood clots in her womb so doctors prepared to perform a surgical procedure to remove them – until a scan showed @entity17 ’s heartbeat			1
bundle of joy : ' she is fine , she is healthy and she is just a big healthy pudding of a baby , ' says @entity2 of her 18 - week old baby @entity17 , pictured here beautiful baby : @entity25 , 18 weeks old , is known as a miracle baby after her twin died in a miscarriage but she survived although the case is rare , medical abortions have a higher failure rate than surgical terminations – up to 14 in every 1,000 , although some studies suggest it could be as high as 4 per cent			1
and in one in 100 cases , the womb is not entirely cleared and further medical intervention is necessary			0
mrs @entity2 , of @entity116 , @entity117 , told the @entity118 she was angry that doctors at the @entity120 in @entity121 had failed to spot the surviving foetus before they prescribed the abortion drugs , which carry an increased risk of birth defects to any surviving baby			1
she said : ‘ as happy as i was , i was angry they had missed her on the scans			0
they said with all the blood and clots it must have created shadows so they could n’t see her			0
’ @entity135 , a spokesman from the @entity136 , which campaigns for improved maternity care in the @entity138 , said it was an ‘ extraordinary case ’			0
she said : ‘ i have very , very occasionally heard of rare cases of a miscarriage of one baby , and then seeing another on the scan			1
‘ but i have never heard of this happening			0
i ca n’t think of a medical reason for it to happen – it is just luck			0
