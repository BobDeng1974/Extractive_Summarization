nothing can stir the quiet reserve of a monk			0
brother @entity4 , in @entity6 , @entity7 , offered to help brother @entity8 rearrange a flight home from @entity11			1
and so began a saga of monumental proportions that led an exasperated @entity14 to exclaim down the phone : ' thank you for speaking			2
i will pray for you			0
but you have not been helpful			0
' dispute : @entity3 told @entity7 monk brother @entity14 he could n't buy a new return flight for his colleague because they suspected the ticket was bought fraudulently			1
it sparked a terse row it started , according to the @entity27 , in late november			0
@entity8 had bought a $ 2,489 return flight to his native @entity11 to visit his sick mother			1
as time went on it became clear he would have to stay longer , so he contacted the @entity33 monastery			1
brother @entity14 said he would take care of it			1
little did he know what imbroglio lay ahead			0
' he was told that the company never received payment for the ticket , ' the @entity27 reported			0
baffled , the monk explained his colleague had already used the first leg of the ticket			2
@entity3 accepted that but said they suspected it was fraudulently purchased so he was not allowed to use @entity8 's credit to purchase a new flight			1
the @entity3 representative concluded the conversation by saying @entity50 , the monastery leader , should drive three hours to @entity52 airport to discuss the discrepancy			1
' it was my tone of voice ' : @entity14 said he instantly regretted his outburst but the situation was later resolved that 's when brother @entity14 lost it			1
' my monastic life is about staying peaceful in all circumstances			0
i failed during this call , ' he told the @entity27			0
' it was my tone of voice			0
i knew that it manifested anger			0
' thankfully for @entity14 , it was not in vain			2
@entity3 eventually conceded after the monastery posted an open letter on their website and made a few more phone calls expressing their discontent			1
@entity8 was finally given his rescheduled ticket , $ 350 credit , and an apology .			2
