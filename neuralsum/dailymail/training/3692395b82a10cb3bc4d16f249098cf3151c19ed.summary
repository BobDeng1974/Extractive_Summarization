the collapse of a 210 - year - old building in the heart of the @entity3 is raising warning flags about decay and a lack of rigorous inspections in one of @entity10 's oldest and most fragile neighborhoods			1
no one was injured when the three - story , brick - and - cypress building collapsed in late october , but the episode has thrown into focus an array of problems throughout the nearly 300 - year - old quarter			1
among them : structural decay , voracious termites at work on aged wood beams , @entity20 's humid climate , absentee landlords and the stresses of modern life as heavy trucks rattle streets and balconied buildings standing shoulder to shoulder			1
perhaps the biggest problem , though , is that no one is charged with making sure the @entity3 's 3,000 old buildings are stable			1
and the city has no in - depth inspection policy tailored to the distinct qualities of its first neighborhood			2
citations are routine for gaudy signs and @entity57 — violations of historical standards — or letting a facade decay			0
owners ca n't be cited for letting a floor sag or allowing mortar to deteriorate to dust on the interiors of their buildings			2
there are city building and fire inspectors , but they do not do random inspections of old structures			2
the commission 's check - ups amount to ' a visual inspection that occurs from the streets , corners , and any aerial views that we are readily afforded , ' said commission chairman @entity80			1
' we do not have the ability to enter a piece of property , or a courtyard , or a rear of a building			2
it could have been crucial in this particular instance			0
' even based on superficial assessments , he 's concerned about the condition of some structures : ' we do have a series of buildings that are highly suspect , should we say			1
' though many residents and preservationists deem the collapse a wake - up call , longtime quarter real estate agent @entity96 thinks the steady rise of wealthier owners ensures most properties are being looked after			2
property values have increased by as much as 30 percent in recent years			0
accident : the collapse near the heart of the @entity3 came at lunchtime on a tuesday on a block of @entity110 lined with high - end art galleries , boutiques , jewelry stores and restaurants scene : renters in the fallen building , one of the earliest three - story structures in the @entity3 , were not at home when it caved in ' there 's a lot of incentive — financial and otherwise — to maintain these properties , ' @entity96 said			1
' it 's a very wealthy area			2
' for now , @entity80 said , the commission hopes property owners will take the initiative and ask inspectors to come in and take a look around			0
it 's not as though there are no interior inspections			0
fire department and city inspectors routinely examine commercial properties — the myriad of crowded bars and restaurants that make the @entity3 so appealing to the 9.2million tourists who visited @entity47 last year			1
building inspectors weigh in whenever major renovations are done to commercial or residential property			0
and banks require a building to be inspected before backing a purchase			0
when it comes to inspections and enforcing good maintenance , @entity47 ' rules do n't differ much from most historic cities and towns , said @entity154 , a regional vice president for the @entity155			0
regulations in @entity158 and @entity159 , for instance , largely match those in @entity47			0
ultimately , that means most of the older structures are n't undergoing regular reviews			0

citation : the owners of the building were cited in 2011 for allowing the facade to decay , but the @entity49 has said no single problem caused the collapse			1
a rear wall of the home following the collapse is seen here precarious : in this october 22 photo , a roof hangs from the three - story , brick - and - cypress building that collapsed in the historic @entity3 ' incredibly , no one got killed , ' said @entity191 , an architect who regularly works in the @entity3 and who believes the neighborhood needs a stronger inspection protocol			1
the owners of the building were cited in 2011 for allowing the facade to decay , but the @entity49 has said no single problem caused the collapse			1
in the past year alone , 302 warnings were issued to owners whose structures were considered , at least on the exterior , to be in dangerously bad condition , according to figures provided by the city			0
the elderly lady who owned the building operated a small shop where she cut keys and made second - line umbrellas , the decorative parasols common in jazz processions , until about two years ago , said @entity213 , an amateur neighborhood historian and a well - known figure around the @entity3 for his decades as the captain of the @entity217 steamboat			1
' i watched them pull out the old timbers , ' he said , standing somberly in front of a pile of bricks where the facade once stood			0
' they were badly damaged by termites			0
' behind the stuccoed walls of the @entity3 's old buildings , bricks made hundreds of years ago from @entity231 mud are crumbling			1
add to the stress load hurricanes , heavy tourist traffic , and a constant rumbling of multi-ton trucks carrying beer , food , garbage and heavy equipment			0
' these buildings were built for horse and buggies , ' @entity213 said			0
' i lie in bed and i feel my house ( in the @entity3 ) go up and down			2
the pictures on my walls bounce up and down when the big trucks go by outside			0
