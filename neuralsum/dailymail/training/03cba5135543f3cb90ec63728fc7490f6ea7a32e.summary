by @entity1 reporter published : 10:01 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 13:49 est , 24 october 2013 @entity3 are up in arms over president @entity6 's proposal to create unisex hats that some have branded too ' girly ' for males - while others have lambasted its steep cost as unnecessary			0
one estimate is that the divisive new hats , which are thinner and smaller than those in the current uniforms , could cost as much as $ 8 million			2
' what 's wrong with the current uniform ? ' one @entity3 posted on a story about the proposed hats			1
' nothing ! read the news ... @entity3 getting relieved , budgets and structure being cut , and we have time / desire to evaluate a new cover [ hat ]			0
you got ta to be kidding ! ' new design : proposed new hats for the @entity3 are smaller and thinner - and will cost $ 8 million the hats , which have been designed to be used in male and female uniforms , are called the ' @entity34 ' hat after a @entity36 sergeant who earned the @entity37 twice			1
he famously led his tired , outnumbered @entity3 at @entity38 in june 1918 during @entity39 , yelling : ' come on , you sons of b * * * * es , do you want to live forever ! ' but some @entity3 are complaining about the switch from the old hats , which have been part of the uniform since 1922 , while others have complained about its look			1
' the @entity34 cap looks too @entity51 , and the last people we want to associate our @entity3 with would be the @entity51 military , ' one wrote on the @entity3			2
old design : the current hats are much wider - but the @entity3 wants uniforms to be unisex another quipped : ' why not just put them all in pink camo ? ' name sake : the hats are named after ' @entity34 ' a @entity39 sergeant who earned the @entity37 one senior @entity3 source added to the @entity67 : ' we do n't even have enough funding to buy bullets , and the @entity71 is pushing to spend $ 8 million on covers that look like women 's hats ! ' the @entity3 deserve better			1
it makes them look ridiculous			0
' so far the hats are just a proposed design , and a second part of the proposal suggests women simply wearing the current male hats with slight modifications - instead of the @entity34 hat			1
@entity3 head gen. @entity84 will make the final decision , and officials have until the end of this week to allow or reject the proposed design			0
the move to make female uniforms more like those worn by men comes as the @entity71 starts to open more combat unit roles to women			1
an informal survey of the @entity3 uniform advisory board already found : ' the group members did not like the appearance of the @entity34 cap on the male @entity3			2
' but the @entity56 reported how , over the years , the @entity99 has made recommendations against the opinions expressed by the @entity3 in surveys			0
one example was the decision to wear uniform sleeves rolled down , even in the summer .			0

the hats , called ' @entity34 ' hats after @entity39 sergeant , are part of a proposed uniform change to make female uniforms more like those worn by men
move comes as the @entity71 starts to open more combat unit roles to women
