by @entity0 these cramped flats expose the extreme lengths @entity3 will go to for a room of one 's own			1
all of the boltholes were advertised in the last fortnight in the capital , which is caught in the centre of an explosion in the housing market - with some of the studios pictured costing more than £ 1,000 a month			1
last week a @entity14 council banned a landlord from letting out a studio flat so small that its bed blocked a kitchen cupboard , despite a tenant agreeing to rent it for £ 737 a month in less than 16 hours			1
room with a stew : there was an outcry after this flat - so small the bed blocks a kitchen cupboard - was let for £ 737 a month			1
but it is not the only ' shoebox ' in @entity14 fancy breakfast in bed ? the tenant of this flat in @entity33 , west @entity14 , would only have to take two steps to the hob - for the princely sum of £ 563 a month cosy : this flat is £ 542 a month in @entity39 , north west @entity14			1
new build @entity42 homes are the smallest in western @entity43 , the @entity40 says council officers investigated after the listing in @entity46 , north @entity14 , was plastered over social media and attracted the attention of the press , and found it could not be rented in its current state			2
cllr @entity52 , the council 's executive member for housing , said : ' this place is a shoebox , not a flat , so we 're serving a prohibition order to stop it being rented out again			0
' but the flat was not the only one with an ultra-quick route to breakfast in bed			2
thousands of studio flats are advertised in the capital , many of them costing more than entire homes in the north of @entity69			1
often grand @entity71 or @entity72 townhouses are split into several shoebox dwellings on each floor , each with a tiny kitchen and shower			2
the huge furore on social media over the @entity46 flat has not put off potential landlords			0
since then , another studio has come on the market a few streets away for £ 1,083 per month			2
it boasts a sleek , modern design - but the kitchen sink is also reachable from the end of the bed			1
sleek : this north @entity14 flat 's modern design will make it far more appealing , but it comes at a cost - £ 1,083 per month - and the kitchen is still shaped around the bed convenient : the shower of this £ 542 - a - month flat in @entity33 , west @entity14 , is inside the bedroom , though the toilet ( shared with one other person ) is mercifully not @entity101 : this flat costs £ 780 a month in the exclusive west @entity14 enclave of @entity104			1
location is everything , as it has two hobs and the kitchen and bed almost touch elsewhere a flat is advertised for £ 780 a month in the exclusive west @entity14 enclave of @entity104 - but its occupant should n't have too exclusive a taste in cooking , as it has two electric hobs squeezed onto a kitchen counter which ends about 1ft from the bed			1
one of the biggest problems is storage space			0
one flat in @entity119 , north @entity14 , solves that by having its occupant climb a ladder to reach their mattress			0
but its price - at £ 607 a month , comparatively low for the capital - is still more than an average three - bedroom flat in @entity126			1
@entity42 now has the smallest new flats in western @entity43 , according to the @entity40			2
it launched a campaign last year calling for an end to ' rabbit hutch @entity42 ' and saying the average new one - bedroom flat is now smaller than a @entity134 carriage			1
but as a carriage on the jubilee line is a princely 495 square feet , most of those pictured in this article are likely to be far smaller than that			0
and that size is still 100 square feet larger than the minimum size of a one - bed flat recommended by the @entity144			1
@entity146 presenter @entity145 fronted the campaign , saying : ' this is n't rocket science			0
we all instinctively respond to the opportunity for a view , a connection with the outdoors , fresh air , light and space			0
' a return to minimum space standards is crucial for the health and wellbeing of the people who will be living in new build homes			0
' lofty : numbering at least six steps - or one giant leap - the occupant of this £ 607 - a - month flat in @entity119 , north @entity14 , would face a long walk to the fridge space : a £ 628 - a - month studio in @entity173 's @entity172 , west @entity14			1
house prices in the capital are now almost 25 per cent more than in their pre-recession peak this flat in @entity179 , west @entity14 , will set you back an eye - watering £ 1,257 a month - despite being just big enough to sleep , eat and cook with few feet to spare but mr @entity145 's comments , almost a year ago , came before yet another surge in @entity14 house prices			1
last week it was revealed homes in the capital are selling for almost 25 per cent more than in their peak before the recession - and more than double the average in the rest of the country			2
the @entity194 said a typical home in the capital is worth £ 459,000 , 24.8 per cent more than in january 2008			2
' @entity14 ’s renters are getting a raw deal with flats that are costly , cramped and claustrophobic ' - @entity199 , shelter it is not only flats that are up for grabs			0
in april a ramshackle building next to an industrial estate in south @entity14 , whose most prominent use was to park the mayor of @entity210 's car , sold at auction for £ 550,000 after a bidding war - three times its estimate			0
parking spaces have also boomed in price , with a single space offered in a car park under the @entity218 in @entity219 , west @entity14 , for £ 400,000			0
the huge increases have sparked fears of a bubble limited entirely to the capital			0
prices across the rest of the @entity42 are still 2.4 per cent lower than they were before the financial crisis , at £ 195,000			2
@entity199 , campaigns director for the homeless charity shelter , told @entity228 : ' this is further proof that @entity14 ’s renters are getting a raw deal with flats that are costly , cramped and claustrophobic			0
' the huge cost of private rents in the capital and tough competition for homes means that many renters have no choice but to take the first place they can afford , whether they are in poor condition or far too small for them and their families			0
' the mayor needs to get serious about building the affordable homes we desperately need , or times will keep getting tougher for generation rent			0

there was an outcry after a flat was let for £ 737 a month - despite the bed blocking one of the kitchen cupboards
but it is not the only tiny flat in the capital , with some one - room boltholes advertised for more than £ 1,000 a month
even *cheapest* outstrip three - bedroom flats in @entity126 as leading *architects* warn of ' rabbit hutch @entity42 '
