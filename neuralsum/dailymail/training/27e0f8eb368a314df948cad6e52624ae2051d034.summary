she is part of the house of @entity2 and @entity3 of the @entity4 clearly finds her married name inspiring			2
the @entity8 - born @entity4 royal , 43 , cut a patriotic figure in her orange top as she visited the @entity11 in @entity12 with husband @entity13 yesterday			1
@entity3 , who became @entity14 of the @entity4 in 2013 , teamed her tangerine and grey @entity17 dress with matching orange suede court shoes and her favourite chunky jewellery			1
glamorous : @entity3 cut a patriotic figure in a tangerine and grey @entity17 dress during a visit to @entity12 the royal couple stopped to chat to well - wishers as they arrived at the museum , with @entity3 handed a bouquet of equally patriotic tulips			1
joined by @entity12 mayor , @entity31 , the pair were shown around the exhibits , which combined , tell the story of the nearby @entity35 peat district			0
one of the key early drivers of industry in the area , the @entity35 peat moors are more than 5,000 years old and helped to fuel trade between the @entity4 and its neigbours , as well as the @entity42			0
more pertinently for the museum , the peat also helped to preserve the thousands of artefacts dropped into it over the years , including , most impressively , the remains of a wagon wheel dating from 2,500 bc. @entity3 , who was shown several paintings of the peat villages that once dotted the surrounding countryside , certainly appeared to enjoy her tour and asked questions of the curators as she went			0
enjoying herself : @entity3 teamed her dress with a charcoal hat and orange earrings for the visit helping out : @entity3 met farmers and volunteers from the @entity35 area after touring the museum floral tribute : the @entity4 royal was handed a bunch of equally patriotic tulips by well - wishers in the crowd the @entity4 royals were also shown into a nearby cultural centre , where they met local farmers and museum volunteers , some of whom were helping unpack boxes of maps			2
all eyes , however , were on @entity3 who was on vibrant form as she strode through the crowds in her striking colour - block dress , which was on its second outing			0
as with much of her wardrobe , the dress was by @entity17 , a @entity86 label that began life in a small @entity89 atelier in 1930			1
after almost half a century of making very little headway , the brand was taken over by @entity92 who transformed it into a fashion force to be reckoned with			0
the label , which created the dress worn by @entity86 's @entity97 for her 2001 wedding , was also behind the gown worn by @entity3 for her engagement portrait in 2002			1
11 years later , the royal wore a nude silk gown by the same label for her inaugural balcony appearance after becoming @entity14 of the @entity4			0
what 's that ? @entity3 , who was escorted by mayor @entity31 ( left ) , grimaced at something in the crowd matching : @entity3 ensured that all parts of her ensemble were either bright orange or grey @entity115 to meet you : @entity13 stopped to shake the hand of a young disabled girl stylish : @entity3 shows off her bold jewellery and broad - brimmed charcoal grey felt hat			2

@entity3 , 43 , was visiting the @entity11 in @entity12
