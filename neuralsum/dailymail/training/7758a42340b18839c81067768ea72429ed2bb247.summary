a tiny typographical error may have been what led to a plutonium waste barrel packed at @entity3 to explode , leak through the ground and contaminate 22 workers early this year , says a new report			1
an order to use the wrong type of kitty litter in the barrels is the likely culprit and thousands of other barrels were packed with it			1
the @entity14 reported last week the unbelievable bumbling that made a minor mixup into a massive problem at @entity19 's only permanent nuclear waste dump			2
oops : the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 was the site of a radiation leak that contaminated 22 employees -- all thanks to typo that led to @entity3 to pack thousands of nuclear waste barrels with the wrong kitty litter an investigation into the weeks and months leading up to the february 14 rupture outside @entity14 revealed a man in charge of ensuring the waste at @entity36 ( @entity21 ) is safe chalked the whole thing up to two little letters			1
' general consensus is that the " organic " designation was a typo that was nâ€™t caught , ' @entity39 wrote to his chief nuclear engineer @entity43 back in may			2
however , those letters meant that up to 5,565 barrels would be mistakenly packed with a wheat - based kitty litter instead of a clay - based one			1
according to the @entity14 : ' @entity3 has never publicly acknowledged the reason why it switched from clay - based litter to the organic variety ... ' that 's a lot of barrels : up to 5,565 barrels were packed with the wrong kitty litter and sent to the dump a half - mile underground at the @entity36 ( pictured ) previous findings by government regulators suggest the waste drum -- along with 15 others -- contained a volatile mix of nitrate salts and organic matter that ruptured the barrel after it was placed in a vault half a mile underground at the plant			1
such a mix was shown to be ' inherently hazardous ' in a 2000 study by the @entity19 @entity69			0
but flawed procedures at @entity3 fostered a culture ' that permitted the introduction of potentially incompatible materials ' in waste drums there , according to the report by the @entity78 's @entity77			2
the lab 's ' waste processing and safety - related control procedures should have prevented the addition of these potentially incompatible materials			0
however , the process failed in this matter , " federal inspectors said in the report			0
at the @entity36 , officials are working on a plan to decontaminate the mine and seal off the rooms with the suspect waste			0
@entity92 has said it could take up to three years to reopen the multi-billion - dollar site			0
officials at the @entity3 ( pictured ) have not said what led to the dangerous mistake			0
sixteen of the barrels are believed to contain the chemical elements that led to the explosion at @entity21 in february			1

the @entity23 *facility* switched from a clay - based to a plant - based litter , which caused a drum to leak in february
a report from the @entity14 out last week *details* the bumbling -- *including* an order for the wrong litter -- *predating* the leak
the barrels containing the organic litter are also *mislabled* and say they contain *inorganic* litter
sixteen of the barrels are believed to contain the other chemical elements that led @entity121 to basically become a bomb
