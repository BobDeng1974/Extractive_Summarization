published : 12:45 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 12:45 est , 16 august 2013 for men , growing their facial hair throughout the month of november has become a brilliant , if itchy , way to make money for charity			1
dubbed @entity6 , the winter month sees chaps of all ages , occupations and facial fur levels get sponsored to grow impressive moustaches in a bid to raise awareness and funds for prostate cancer			2
last year , an enterprising group of feminists were inspired by the movement to start their own hair - growing charity enterprise and @entity21 was born			1
@entity21 is a charity event encouraging women to grow their armpit hair for august to raise money for @entity27 charity @entity26			1
one of the organisers @entity29 appeared on this morning to encourage women to throw away their razors the idea is simple , throughout the month of august women are encouraged to let their armpit hair grow , asking friends and family to sponsor them to raise money for @entity26 , the charity for people with @entity27 ( @entity27 )			1
@entity27 affects up to 10 % of women and a common symptom can be excessive hair growth , so by growing their hair the group say that they are ' working towards having pride in our body hair , not shame '			1
as well as raising money and awareness for the @entity27 charity the group hope that the action , if picked up by enough women , will be successful in changing attitudes about body hair and femininity			1
currently the idea of growing body hair , especially armpit hair , is alien to most western women			1
but why does the subject cause such controversy , and can @entity62 succeed in making body hair on women norm rather than niche ? one of the organisers of event @entity29 , 25,appeared on this morning today to discuss the charity event and encourage women to throw away the razor			1
the feminist campaigner , who has n't shaved any part of her body for four years , proudly showed off her full armpit hair as she debated the issue with hosts @entity76 and @entity78			1
she said : ' i stopped shaving because i was working as a nanny and thought that the children wo n't care , then i realised that i actually really liked it so decide to stop completely			0
the @entity21 website has full information on the initiative and upcoming events for part or full - time hairies @entity6 encourages men to grow moustaches to raise money for prostate cancer and the girls can get involved with moustache merchandise ' the reactions are n't as bad as you think			1
sometimes people stare , especially on the tube , but i just stare back			0
' originally i was really embarrassed because i was n't really comfortable with it and i had never seen my own body hair			1
i worried that people were staring at me and worried what they might think , but after a while i realised " it 's totally fine , it 's just a part of my body "			2
' i think my body hair looks really nice			1
i take pride in my appearance and i do n't see why that should include shaving			0
' as part of the @entity21 campaigning group @entity113 , who fondly calls her hairy armpits her ' pit kittens ' , is often demonstrating with other women who refuse to shave , and while most people are sympathetic to their cause , some women have been overtly hostile			1
she said : ' when we were doing activity for @entity21 and there were a lot of us with hairy armpits one women walked past and started retching , and one woman walked past and said she would rather have cancer then hairy armpits , which is obviously really insensitive			2
' the subject proved a hot topic on @entity132 following the tv debate with hundreds tweeting in support of letting female body hair do its own thing			1
one feminist blogger said : ' " my bf wouldnt go near me if i had # hairypits " says one @entity132			2
um , change your boyfriend then , not your pits			0
# saynotobodypolicing ' another tweeted : ' i think of my body hair as a d ! ckhead repellent			1
' it 's not to late for women to get involved and the group is organising a @entity152 in @entity153 at the end of august for people to show off their newly - grown pits with pride			2
see armpits4august.org for more details polycystic ovary syndrome ( @entity27 ) is a condition that affects how a woman ’s ovaries work			1
@entity27 affects millions of women in the @entity164			0
there are three features which lead to a woman being diagnosed with @entity27			0
even if only two of them are present , this is enough to confirm the diagnosis			0
the features of @entity27 include : these can lead to the following symptoms : what are polycystic ovaries ? @entity178 ovaries contain a large number of harmless cysts that are no bigger than 8mm each			0
normal ovaries have only about half this number of cysts			0
the cysts are under - developed follicles which contain eggs that have n’t developed properly			0
often in @entity27 , these follicles are unable to release an egg , meaning ovulation does n’t take place			0
many women have polycystic ovaries without having the syndrome ( without the symptoms )			2
some women have the syndrome , but have normal - looking ovaries on ultrasound			2
causes of polycystic ovary syndromethe exact cause of @entity27 is unknown , but it often runs in families			0
women who are overweight are more at risk of developing @entity27			0
many women with @entity27 have a family history of diabetes and high cholesterol			0
it ’s also believed that insulin may play a role			0
insulin is a hormone that controls sugar levels in the body			0
many women with @entity27 have too much insulin in their body , which contributes to the increased production and activity of male hormones			2
being overweight increases the amount of insulin that your body produces			0
