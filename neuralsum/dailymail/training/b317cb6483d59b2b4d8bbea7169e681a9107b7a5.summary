by @entity1 reporter published : 14:55 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 15:11 est , 7 november 2013 the @entity2 is paying @entity3 more than $ 10million a year to provide phone records for overseas counter-terrorism investigations adding another agency to the list of government offices tapping into citizen 's phone logs			1
the @entity11 quoted government officials confirming that the second - biggest @entity14 mobile service provider is cooperating under a voluntary contract			0
that means that this partnership is a financial one , and @entity3 is not under subpoenas or court orders compelling the company to participate			0
paying customers : the @entity2 pays @entity3 $ 10million to hand over information about potential terrorists , and the financial deal proves that the partnership between the phone company and the agency is not forced @entity3 did not confirm or deny the report but said payments from governments were routine for lawful data			1
the report comes amid widespread political uproar after former @entity37 contractor @entity35 leaked documents describing how the @entity14 government collects far more internet and telephone data than previously known			1
under the @entity3 arrangement , the @entity2 supplies phone numbers of overseas terrorism suspects and @entity3 searches its database to provide call records that may help identify foreign associates , the paper said			1
most of the call logs provided by @entity3 involve foreign - to - foreign calls , the paper said			0
@entity3 does not disclose the identity of the @entity14 calling from the @entity14 , and masks their phone numbers when it produces the records , the paper said , quoting the officials			1
that does little to block the @entity2 from finding out the @entity14 involved , however , as it just means that they have to jump through some bureaucratic hoops first			2
another agency : previous phone tapping revelations concerned the @entity37 , and now this proves that the @entity2 ( pictured ) is involved in very similar operations with the help of the @entity68 the @entity2 is tasked with handling security threats abroad and does not have the rights to obtain certain information about domestic citizens - which is left for the @entity68			1
to get the information that @entity3 obstructs , the @entity11 says that the @entity2 asks the @entity68 to order an administrative subpoena to @entity3 , forcing the company to hand over the personal data of the phone number in question			2
the @entity68 then shares that information with the @entity2			0
@entity3 said all government data requests were handled in a lawful and proper manner			0
' we ensure that we maintain customer information in compliance with the laws of the @entity14 and other countries where information may be maintained , ' @entity3 spokesman @entity82 said in an emailed statement			2
' like all telecom providers , we routinely charge governments for producing the information provided			0

new reports shows @entity3 *profited* from *turning* records over
@entity2 *focuses* on *global* security , so were interested in @entity14 making international calls to possible terror suspects abroad
government *sources* confirmed the financial *relationship*
@entity3 would *n't* comment but said that they *continue* to help in public *safety* operations at the request of the government
comes after leaked documents proved the @entity37 was gathering information on phone and internet records of @entity14 citizens
