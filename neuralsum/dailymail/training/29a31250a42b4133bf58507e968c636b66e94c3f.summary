@entity0 : @entity1 has huge potential and talent , but the @entity5 midfielder risks seeing his career go up in smoke @entity1 appeared to hit back at his critics after becoming embroiled in another smoking controversy			1
photos of the midfielder holding a shisha pipe at a nightclub were posted on social media and quickly made national headlines			1
on thursday evening , @entity1 posted on @entity16 a video of himself in training as he recovers from ankle surgery along with the message : ' worry about your character not your reputation , because your character is who you are and your reputation is only what people who do n't know you think about you ! ' @entity1 shared a video on @entity16 of one of his workout sessions the @entity5 midfielder is closing in on a return to full fitness after having surgery on his ankle @entity1 has been out of action since november after suffering ankle ligament damage @entity1 ( right ) appeared to be holding a shisha pipe during a night out in @entity39 the @entity40 are to seek clarification from @entity1 over the circumstances of the incident , which is understood to have happened during a night out with friends in central @entity39 last week			1
a picture of @entity1 was uploaded to @entity16 , before being removed and replaced with an edited version where only the face of the @entity5 player was visible in the background			1
however , the original image , where the @entity51 international held the shisha pipe , was then subsequently reposted on @entity54 , sparking much debate across social media over the player 's behaviour ahead of saturday 's north @entity39 derby at @entity60			1
@entity1 is passed a cigarette while on a friend 's stag do in @entity64 the @entity51 footballer spotted chatting up a mystery woman and smoking outside @entity68 in @entity39 @entity5 take a dim view on players smoking			1
in january , goalkeeper @entity71 was hit with a £ 25,000 fine after it emerged he lit up in the showers following the 2 - 0 defeat at @entity75 on @entity76 , since when the @entity77 has not started a @entity79 match			0
speaking in july after a previous incident , @entity1 said : ' the smoking ? of course i regret it			2
i have been seen before doing it			0
i said then i made a mistake and i have made a mistake again			0
@entity1 has once again made the headlines for the wrong reasons			2
when is he going to realise his place in the @entity5 team is under serious threat and start acting like a professional ? @entity95 , @entity96 surely it 's time to start educating @entity1 and have somebody explain to him how to behave			1
if he was smoking that pipe , even if it does n't do him any serious damage as a player i would n't put myself in that position			2
the goalkeeper has already lost his place over a smoking issue so you would never dream of being seen with anything – cigarette , shisha , lager , anything			2
being in the team means so much to you and is such a reward for your efforts that it 's not worth that risk			0
he is obviously going out and thinks he is in a private situation but you never are as a footballer , there is always somebody on the lookout			0
you have to be squeaky clean and if you are serious about your football that 's how you should want to live anyway			0
@entity126 @entity1 grimaces in pain following a challenge during the game against @entity130 at @entity131 the @entity51 international is treated on the pitch before being replaced at @entity131 in november news of @entity1 's smoking is bound to infuriate manager @entity136 yet again @entity137 or hooka pipes are a way of smoking tobacco , usually mixed with fruit or molasses sugar , through a bowl and hose or tube ' i am young and i will learn from it			2
i realise the consequences it has and the effect on kids growing up			0
' i have kids myself and i do n't want them growing up to think their dad smokes and it is okay for a footballer to smoke , because it 's not			0
' it is unacceptable and i will accept the consequences and i will move on			0
