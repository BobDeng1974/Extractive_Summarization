a teenager who was devoted to jeans and t - shirts has swapped her tomboy style in favour of dressing like a real - life doll			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity7 used to opt for a more masculine style but her outfits have seen a complete turnaround as she has added petticoats , bonnets and multicoloured wigs to her everyday wardrobe			1
the 19 - year - old 's ensembles are not saved purely for fancy dress , wearing her brightly coloured outfits everywhere from bus stops to the supermarket - with some costing as much as £ 300			0
at the age of only 17 , @entity33 became instantly hooked , and started to save every penny she could to fund her new found hobby			1
within just two years , @entity33 has spent over a staggering £ 2,000 on perfecting her unique appearance , but she says the expense has been worth it and she finally feels complete			1
' i love wearing my outfits , i would n't be me if i did n't wear them			0
' i adore every single dress and all the accessories , i would n't be seen in anything else			0
i appreciate that it 's different but it really is special to me , i feel happy when i wear them			0
' @entity33 admits that her new style is a dramatic change from her previous choice in clothes but she much prefers her feminine outfits			1
@entity33 has recently dyed her hair pink to match her pastel coloured ensembles before she dedicated her wardrobe to frills and petticoats @entity33 's style was very masculine @entity33 has spent over £ 2,000 on outfits , this green dress is her favourite and set her back £ 300 ' when i was younger i liked @entity67 and stuff guys liked			1
i used to just wear jeans and a t - shirt - but i always felt like something was missing			0
' @entity33 added that at first not everyone was as fond of her new dress sense but they have since accepted her new style			1
' it was a bold and unusual kind of fashion to be wearing but i loved it			2
' ' my parents were a bit confused at first as it was such a drastic change , my dad would insist i was just playing dress up			0
' but it was n't long until they both came around to my new style of clothes			2
' at the time , school girl @entity33 lived in her school uniform , and her doll clothes were only worn on special occasions			2
but a year and a half later , @entity33 bagged herself a job as a cleaner in a hotel and saved her wages until she was able to afford the wardrobe of her dreams			1
@entity33 says that her look is so unusual she is often approached by tourists in the street for photos the 19 - year - old says that she often faces abuse from strangers on the street because of her unique choice in clothes @entity33 's style is not one that she saves for dressing up and is happy to go about her day to day activities in her @entity26 outfits ' i 've now ditched the jeans and choose to opt for corsets almost every day of the week			1
' my favourite outfit to date is a mint green dress , it has a row of printed toys along the bottom of the skirt , it 's really cute			0
' this particular outfit set @entity33 back by a whopping £ 300			2
after recently dying her hair pink to compliment her wardrobe @entity33 has seen onlookers take an interest in her and has even had tourists approach her for pictures			2
@entity26 style clothes are few and far between in @entity131 so many of @entity33 's clothes are shipped in from @entity27 ' lots of people ask for a picture with me , but i 'm not a tourist attraction ! ' ' having pink hair gets you lots of attention , especially when the rest of your outfit matches your hair			1
@entity26 is hard to find in the @entity131 , so @entity33 has to look elsewhere for her fill of frills			1
her favourite store , @entity147 , is based in @entity27 and is the biggest and most popular for @entity26 fanatics			2
@entity33 says that her obscure taste in fashion has led her to discover a whole community of women who share her enthusiasm			2
@entity33 has been called ' @entity155 ' and ' @entity156 ' by strangers in the street despite having to cope with some negative comments @entity33 says that she feels at her happiest dressed like in her candy coloured ensembles ' i 'm not alone , there 's a small community of @entity26 fashionistas based in @entity7			1
we all often meet up at local coffee shops and museums			0
' we cause quite a stir in the capital but it 's nice to meet up and have something in common - my friends do n't understand the latest @entity26			0
' despite some negativity , @entity33 has many supportive comments from those around her , with many wishing they had her confidence			0
being branded as ' @entity182 ' and ' @entity156 ' in the streets may cause upset for some , but @entity33 remains unfazed and confident in her appearance			0
' a few people will shout across the street - but i just ignore them			0
' i can dress how i like , it makes me feel happy - so let me wear it ! '			0
