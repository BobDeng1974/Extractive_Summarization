by @entity0 published : 06:06 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 08:41 est , 11 july 2013 if you 've ever wondered what goes on inside the @entity3 , with its gold vaults and piles of cash , you can finally find out			0
the famous building has thrown its doors to the world today , with the launch of its @entity12 app that gives users a tour of the mysterious institution			1
available to download free of charge via the @entity20 and @entity19 marketplace , the app takes visitors on a virtual tour of the central bank ’s historic building , with 360 ° panoramic views			1
the original design was by sir @entity41 and dates from 1774 but the room was moved in the 1930s the @entity3 ( pictured ) is throwing open its doors to its gold and cash vaults with the launch of its first app the app allows users to find information about the workings of the bank			1
here , a picture of a stash of banknotes is annotated with facts such as that there are around two billion banknotes in circulation the highlight of the tour is arguably the bank 's staggering gold vaults - one of the largest in the world - that houses over 400,000 bars of the precious metal			1
while gold plays no role in the @entity3 ’s policy decisions today , it remains a mark of stability and value			0
the bank keeps the valuable bars safe for the @entity31 government , other central banks around the world and members of the @entity81 but actually only owns two standard size bars and two @entity84 bars itself			1
it is hard to imagine how much the room is worth in total as the value of a gold bar in june was around £ 350,000			0
amazingly no gold has ever been stolen from the bank apart from in films and an episode of @entity94			2
the tour also visits the cash vault where the @entity3 holds a portion of its vast stock of banknotes , of which there are approximately two billion in circulation			2
this is an image of the @entity3 's staggering supply of bank notes			1
there are £ 50 billion worth of banknotes in circulation			0
the bank issues approximatly one billion new notes a year the @entity111 staircase was completed during the @entity113 re-building of the @entity115 premises between 1935 and 1939			0
it is located in the front hall of the bank and was among the longest in @entity118			0
it overlooks an original @entity84 mosaic the app shows virtual visitors treasures such as this mosaic			2
it was created by @entity125 , a @entity126 whose work can also be seen in @entity128 and the @entity129 the bank has been issuing notes for over 300 years , although early banknotes were simply receipts for gold deposited at the bank			1
there are over £ 50 billion worth of banknotes in circulation and the bank issues around one billion new ones every year as well as destroying the old ones			2
app users can also learn about the security features on each of the @entity3 ’s notes in the app 's ‘ know your banknotes ’ feature			1
virtual visitors can explore the @entity150 , a surprising garden feature at the heart of the building that is planted with mulberry trees , which were used to make the first paper money issued in 10th century @entity156			2
the bank also shares the gruesome tale of the ' bank giant ' with the public in its first app. a former clerk at the bank who was two metres tall was buried in the garden in 1798 to protect it from grave snatchers			0
less surprisingly , the @entity3 ’s monetary policy and financial stability roles are also illustrated in the tour , with a visit to the room where the @entity171 meets to set interest rates every month			0
doors to the committee room , where interest rates are decided , were originally designed to prevent eavesdropping			0
this is the elegant @entity178 where the bank 's @entity171 meets to decide the official interest rate the secret @entity150 at the @entity3			1
it has its origins in the churchyard of @entity183 , which was demolished in 1782 to make way for the expansion of the @entity3			0
one of the conditions of the @entity187 permitting the demolition of the church was that the graveyard remain undisturbed - and so it was until the re-building of the @entity3 in the 1920s and 1930s when it was centralised behind the new @entity115 entrance to the bank the @entity199 of the @entity3 houses a mini model of its inner buildings , some of which the general public will be able to explore for the first time using the bank 's first app symbols reflecting money and finance are everywhere inside the bank and you can spot plenty of lions and eagles , which represent the relationship between the pound and the dollar			1
the mosaics featured in the app tour are based upon coin designs from @entity218 until the 1920s			0
the mosaic seen at the base the bank 's impressive staircase is actually one of three uncovered by excavations during the building of the bank and is believed to be from a 2nd century roman villa that once stood on this site			1
most of the @entity115 building is , of course , a working space devoted to monetary and financial stability			0
but it is also a recognisable landmark to many people , and the app provides a unique glimpse of some of the bank ’s more significant locations behind its familiar facade			2
the @entity3 's first virtual tour app is available for @entity245 and @entity246 devices and can also be accessed on computers the app also includes a ' know your banknote ' feature that shows different marks of authenticity - handy for spotting if you have a fake			1

new app gives the public a virtual tour of the @entity31 central bank 's building , including its staggering reserves of gold and banknotes with amazing 360 ° images
it is available in the @entity267 and @entity19 store , but *individuals* can also take the tour on their computer
