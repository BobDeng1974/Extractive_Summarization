@entity0 always wondered why she suffered from terrible cramps and heavy periods during puberty			1
but it was n't until she turned 18 that she was given her astonishing diagnosis - she had two vaginas			2
the blonde 27 - year - old from @entity8 has the million - in - one condition uterus didelphys , which means she has two separate uteruses and cervixes as well			1
' once i found out what it was i told everybody , ' she told tv hosts @entity25 and @entity26			0
' i thought it was amazing and it 's definitely an ice - breaker at parties ' she added : ' if women want to have a look , i 'm quite happy to show them , it 's not something i 'm embarrassed by			2
' @entity0 went to the doctor after her long - term boyfriend told her she was ' different ' in the genital area			1
@entity0 has two wombs ( uteruses ) , two cervixes ( neck of the womb ) and a dividing wall between two vaginas sitting next to @entity0 , doctor @entity44 explained : ' when developing in the womb girls start with two tubes			1
these fuse and the septum breaks down and forms one uterus			2
' in around one in 3,000 cases the septum stays within the uterus but to actually have two separate uteruses is much rarer			2
' @entity0 said previously she had found sex very uncomfortable , but now she did n't suffer any adverse effects			1
she turned down surgery as it could have left significant scar tissue			0
@entity0 , pictured at school , had no idea she had the rare condition until she turned 18 she revealed : ' when i was younger i thought i was having cystitis and urine infections from a young age when i was tearing the middle septum			1
' she added that she once asked a school friend which ' hole ' she should use for a tampon , but became too embarrassed to continue the conversation after her friend thought she meant she put it up her bottom			0
she added : ' i used to suffer from horrendous cramps and my periods could be very heavy			0
i now know that my periods were worse because i have two wombs			0
' so if i get pregnant i have to be very aware not to get pregnant on the other side			0
' dr @entity44 added that @entity0 was more likely to have a breached birth as her uteruses were smaller and she was more likely to need a caesarean section			1
she must also have double smear tests when checking for cervical cancer			0
but @entity0 is unphased by the prospect			1
' i have a great sex life , ' she said .			0

uterus didelphys is a million - to - one condition
