by @entity0 @entity3 was beaten up , left with a broken ankle and robbed of his @entity6 sunglasses after he tried to push girls off a ledge for not talking to him at a party , his manifesto has revealed			1
the 141 - page document , which the 22 - year - old virgin emailed to his parents and friends before he killed six people on friday , gives terrifying insight into @entity3 's hatred towards women for failing to pay him attention			1
in one excerpt from last year , he wrote about heading out to party in @entity22 just days before his 22nd birthday in one ' last ditch effort ' to lose his virginity			1
' that was the only thing that could have saved me , ' he wrote in the memoir			1
' i was giving the female gender one last chance to provide me with the pleasures i deserved from them			2
at the party , he quickly became irritated that no one was talking to him , especially girls who were chatting with ' obnoxious slobs ' instead , he wrote			1
so he went outside - but there he saw guys walking with ' hot blonde girls on their arm ' , which ' fueled me with rage ' , he said , explaining that he felt that these girls should have been giving him attention			1
he climbed onto a ledge and - after miming as if he was shooting them - some of the crowd joined him , including ' rowdy boys whom i 've always despised ' and some girls			2
while up there , he became annoyed that none of the girls were talking to him , so he began insulting them , he said			1
' a dark , hate - fueled rage overcame my entire being , and i tried to push as many of them as i could from the 10 - foot ledge , ' he wrote			2
' my main target was the girls			2
i wanted to punish them for talking to the obnoxious boys instead of me			1
' but the group fought back and eventually , he was pushed to the ground			2
when he fell , he heard a ' snap ' in his ankle , breaking it , he said			2
agitated : @entity3 , pictured , said he would speak to his friend , @entity77 , for hours about his troubles as he limped away , he realized that his @entity6 sunglasses were missing and went to get them back , but was so drunk , he could n't remember where the party was			1
instead , he went to a nearby house and demanded to know where his glasses were			0
a group of ' brutes ' started calling him names before dragging him out to the driveway and hitting him , he said			0
@entity3 ' i had never been beaten and humiliated that badly , ' he said			1
' everyone in @entity22 saw what happened , and it was truly horrific			0
' the worst part of this whole ordeal was ... the fact that no one showed any concern ... if girls had been attracted to me , they would have offered to walk me to my room and take care of me			2
they would have even offered to sleep with me to make me feel better			0
' the next morning , he awoke to pain and his father took him to the hospital , where police interviewed him			0
fearful that he could get in trouble , he told them he had acted ' cocky ' towards a group of boys , so they had pushed him from the ledge			0
the police did n't pursue any charges , he said			0
victims : @entity3 's first victims included his roommates @entity119 , left , and @entity120 , right gunned down : @entity121 , left , was also found stabbed to death in their home - although he did not live at the house - while @entity126 gunned down @entity127 , right , when he opened fire at a deli murdered : @entity130 , left , and @entity131 , right , were shot outside a sorority house during his spree as he recovered from his broken ankle , @entity3 's self pity grew and he focused on his ' @entity136 , ' deciding to enact his ' revenge ' in the spring of 2014			1
on friday , @entity3 , the son of @entity139 assistant director @entity138 , acted upon his threats , killing six people before shooting himself dead			1
@entity3 weihan @entity119 , 20 , of @entity142 , and @entity120 , 20 , of @entity143 , were both stabbed to death by @entity3 on friday at the apartment they had shared with him			1
investigators are looking into whether he killed the pair in their sleep			0
the body of another @entity152 student , @entity121 , 19 , of @entity143 , was also found at the apartment , but he did not live there			0
@entity3 then climbed into his suv and drove towards the @entity156 sorority house , where he shot dead @entity157 , 22 , and @entity131 , 19			1
he then got back into his car and drove to a nearby deli , where he opened fire			0
there , he killed student @entity127 , 20 , in an attack that was captured on surveillance footage			0
remembered : students write messages at a tribute to the victims at one of the crime scenes on monday the gunman then climbed back into his car and continued to shoot at passersby as he drove , hitting three pedestrians before he police officers returned fire and shot him in the hip			0
he tried to escape and knocked down a cyclist , before he eventually shot himself in the head and smashed into parked cars			0
when police found his body , he was surrounded by three semi-automatic handguns and nearly 400 rounds of ammunition , which had all been purchased legally .			0

in his rambling memoir , @entity3 *detailed* going out to a party last year in one last ditch attempt to lose his virginity
