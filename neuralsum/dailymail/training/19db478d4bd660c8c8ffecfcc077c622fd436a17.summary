@entity0 fanned suggestions that a late - night rumpus with @entity3 may have contributed to @entity5 ’s late withdrawal from the @entity6 on sunday night			1
the world no 2 disappointed more than 17,000 fans at the @entity9 by pulling out of the final against @entity11 , citing a back injury sustained in his evening semi-final against @entity3			1
but @entity0 also said a post-match spat between the two players , stemming from something @entity3 said to his opponent ’s support bench , would not have helped matters			1
according to courtside photographers his words were directed either at @entity5 ’s wife @entity23 , his father @entity24 , or perhaps both			2
@entity5 and @entity3 ( right ) argued during and after their semi-final match on saturday a weary @entity5 is congratulated by compatriot @entity3 on saturday but they argued later on @entity28 reported that it had picked up @entity3 saying : ‘ she did the same thing at @entity31			1
’ @entity0 told viewers on @entity33 : ‘ afterwards something went on in the locker room , there was a long talk between the players that went on well into the night and the stress of that - i ca n’t confirm all of this - i do n’t think that helped the situation			1
’ when asked about what happened during the apparent altercation in an unusually feisty third set , @entity3 replied : ‘ not much , nothing special			2
tense match , it ’s never easy			0
’ @entity5 takes to the court to explain why he could n't take on @entity11 in the @entity51 final @entity53 executive chairman and president @entity52 ( right ) with @entity5 as the bad news was delivered @entity57 manager @entity56 was part of the crowd at the ) 2 @entity9 on sunday @entity5 declined to speak to the media on sunday night after his withdrawal , but apologised to the crowd in person			1
on monday @entity5 and @entity3 are due to travel to @entity64 where , starting on friday , they will make up the @entity67 team that tackles @entity68 in the @entity69			1
that is the only major prize in tennis that the @entity67 master has not won , and that will incentivise him to quickly smooth things over with his compatriot			2
@entity3 ’s team were eager to write the tiff off as just one of those things that happen in the heat of battle , while sources in the @entity5 camp were emphasising that he pulled out of sunday ’s final purely due to the parlous state of his back			1
@entity5 looks at his shoes as @entity3 ( right ) walks past and off the court on saturday night it can only be speculation how much the stress of saturday ’s unexpectedly fractious semi-final contributed to the situation			1
he and the famously genial @entity3 have always got on well , although the dynamic in their relationship has changed somewhat this year through the latter ’s surge into the elite			2
he even rated at @entity97 1 for a time this year before @entity5 ’s excellent run of results			0
the 17 - time @entity101 winner told the @entity51 crowd that something pulled in his back during the decisive tiebreak			0
‘ i have tried treatment on it , medication , tried to turn it round as quickly as possible but i did n’t really feel that much of an improvement , ’ said @entity5 , who does not know how it will affect his chances next weekend			2
‘ i ca n’t compete at this level with @entity11 , it would be too risky at my age to do this right now			0
’ it was typical @entity5 class to front up before the disappointed crowd , and in his whole career it is only the third time he has pulled out of a match			1
@entity11 holds his @entity122 after a presentation before his exhibition match @entity125 surprised by @entity5 withdrawal to hand him title he only gave up the struggle an hour before the final , and by then @entity52 , the @entity53 ’s executive chairman , had gone into crisis management mode			1
he called @entity132 at his @entity134 home at 2pm to ask him to play a replacement exhibition singles against @entity11 , and a lighthearted doubles with @entity137 , @entity0 and @entity138			2
‘ he instantly offered to help , he did n’t ask for a fee and was n’t offered one , ’ revealed @entity52 , adding that the others had also volunteered to entertain the crowd , which included the likes of @entity56 and @entity143 , for free			0
given that the doubles final ( won by the @entity147 ) took place along with the exhibitions , @entity52 said there would be a partial refund and priority booking next year for ticket holders , who had paid up to £ 110 for their seats			0
as this event makes around £ 10million profit , it is only right			0
@entity5 won a taxing semi-final against @entity3 in a tie - break after two hours and 48 minutes overall a good job was done in managing @entity5 ’s non-appearance , although @entity132 , who lost 6 - 0 , 6 - 1 to the @entity67 earlier in the week , could see the funny side			1
‘ i have to apologise because clearly i pushed @entity5 so hard on thursday , ’ the @entity164 quipped			0
however , questions might again be asked about how fair it is for one semi-final to be played on saturday afternoon and another on saturday night , which happens at many @entity53 events			0
it all capped what has been an unfortunate week , which saw so many one - sided matches - not a vintage year			0
at the end of it all @entity11 was left champion for the third year running , and is very much the man to beat next season			0
@entity180 duo @entity147 celebrate a point on their way to victory in the doubles final at the @entity51			0
