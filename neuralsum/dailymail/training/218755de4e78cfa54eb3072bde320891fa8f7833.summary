seeing just one waterspout is thought by many to be a once - in - a - lifetime event , but one lucky boat passenger managed to capture four in these amazing pictures			1
@entity6 @entity5 managed to take the pictures while sailing off the @entity7 of @entity8 , in the @entity9 , when a huge storm blew up over night			1
the morning light then revealed this stunning scene of the four waterspouts , which develop in a similar way to tornadoes but are usually far weaker			0
waterspouts : @entity5 captured these pictures while sailing off the @entity7 of @entity8 , in the @entity9 the pictures were taken in 1999 but have only come to light after they appeared on a @entity21 website			1
mr @entity5 , who now lives in @entity23 , @entity24 , said : ' we were about a mile away from the nearest one , i asked the captain if they were dangerous as we were heading towards them			1
' he looked at me and made a gesture , but he seemed to be hopeful			0
' i observed this sight over the @entity32 on a boat trip to @entity34 , @entity6			1
as we departed , the weather was very summer - like with some humidity , hot and sunny			1
@entity37 - inspiring : the pictures were taken in 1999 but have only come to light after they appeared on a @entity21 website ' @entity43 clouds developed during our excursion , but the weather did n't appear threatening			1
in fact , the atmospheric pressure was stable at 1,024 millibars			0
photographer : @entity5 said the boat he was on actually passed through the funnels as it continued on its journey ' suddenly , we saw a line of funnel clouds straight in front of our boat			1
the photo shows the most recently formed waterspout in the foreground ; the oldest spout , in the background , would disappear in a few seconds			2
' mr @entity5 however said these were not the only waterspouts he saw while on the boat			1
he said : ' i could count at least 10 on the starboard and some on the port side and they lasted for about four minutes each			0
' the photo shows actually the first waterspout as being the youngest and the latter very thin and the oldest , ready to disappear			2
' our boat actually passed through the scary funnels			0
the spouts were spaced about a third of a nautical mile from each other			0
' this is obviously an old picture and is not even digital but i have been asked recently if it is a fake , which it is not , it has now been used on the website @entity81 , part of @entity21 's @entity83			1
' waterspouts form at focused points over the warmer sea - water where condensation builds between the water and cloud , which contains cool , moist air			2
the spouts do not pull water into the sky , they remain just above the sea forming clouds which form into twisting coils			0
@entity21 's @entity97 said he believed the photograph was real			1
he said : ' waterspouts having multiple funnels , while not often photographed , occur more often than do tornadoes that have multiple funnels			0
' it seems that the convective cloud systems that lead to waterspout formation , which have relatively weak circulation fields compared to tornadoes , can support more but much smaller funnels			2
' waterspouts form in a similar way to tornadoes but are often weaker than their land counterparts			0
the spouts do not suck up water but instead remain just above the sea forming clouds which form into twisting coils			0
the water comes from condensation building up between the warm sea - water and the cloud which contains cool , moist air			2
stronger versions can occur from mesocyclones - which are a vortex of air within a convective storm			0
while waterspouts often form in the tropics they have been spotted in other areas including @entity130 , @entity131 , the @entity132 and @entity133 .			0

@entity6 @entity5 captured images while sailing off @entity7 *island*
taken in 1999 but have only been unveiled after appearing on @entity21 website
