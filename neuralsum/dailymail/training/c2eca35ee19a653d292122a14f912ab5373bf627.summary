by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 11:26 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 13:56 est , 14 november 2012 former @entity4 speaker @entity3 said today that she will run to keep her job , and appeared combative as a reporter asked a question in regard to the 72 - year - old 's age			1
while the mood in the room was predominantly light , tensions rose when the question was posed by @entity16 reporter @entity15			2
@entity15 asked @entity3 about the impact of her decision on a younger @entity19 hoping to rise up the ranks and energize the party			1
' what 's your response ? ' at first , @entity3 shrugged off the question as her supporters blasted the question as ' age discrimination			2
' provocative : @entity3 said a question from @entity16 reporter @entity15 about her age was ' offensive ' but then @entity15 asked again : ' no , excuse me			1
you , mr @entity45 , mr @entity46 , you 're all over 70			0
is your decision to stay on prohibiting younger members for moving forward ? ' @entity3 pushed back , saying : ' let 's for a moment honor it as a legitimate question , although it 's quite offensive			2
you do n't realize that , i guess			0
' eventually , however , @entity3 got the final word with an answer to the question : ' no. ' @entity15 is the son of longtime @entity57 host @entity56 , who died suddenly of a heart attack in 2008			1
@entity3 said she would remain as @entity60 leader in the @entity4 after a pair of elections that kept the party in the minority there even as @entity66 gained seats in the @entity68 and a second term for president @entity70			1
' my colleagues made it very clear : " do n't even think of leaving , " ' she recalled at a news conference , surrounded by female lawmakers			0
' i have made a decision to submit my name to my colleagues to once again serve as the @entity59			0
' republicans reacted to news of her decision to remain with scorn			0
' there is no better person to preside over the most liberal @entity84 in history than the woman who is solely responsible for relegating it to a prolonged minority status , ' said @entity89 , spokesman for the @entity90			0
' this decision signals that @entity4 @entity66 have absolutely no interest in regaining the trust and confidence of the @entity96 people who took the speaker 's gavel away from @entity3 in the first place , ' he said			1
@entity3 has represented a @entity102 area district in the @entity4 , and was first woman in history to serve as speaker			1
the tea party - fueled political wave of 2010 forced the gavel from her hand to rep @entity110 , an @entity112 @entity111			2
a little help from my friends : @entity66 applaud as @entity3 announces she will remain in the @entity4 speaker : @entity3 was succeeded as @entity4 speaker by @entity111 @entity110 of @entity112 holding a news conference wednesday morning , @entity3 said ' we 're very , very proud ' of how large a role women played in the november 6 election			1
' we do n't have the gavel ' of majority status in the @entity4 , she said , ' but we have unity			2
i think our caucus this morning demonstrated that very clearly			0
' ' we must have the further empowerment of women , ' said @entity3 , who noted that when she came to @entity24 there were 23 women in the @entity4 compared to over 60 of the seats in the @entity4			2
we want more , ' she said			0
influence : @entity3 was a major force behind the passage of @entity70 's health care overhaul and the @entity136 @entity3 was a major force behind the passage of @entity70 's health care overhaul and the @entity136			1
even after the 2010 elections , when her party lost 63 seats , @entity3 was reelected @entity60 leader by her caucus			1
@entity3 's colleagues had said for days that the top leadership post was hers if she wanted it in the next @entity24 that begins in january			2
she refused to reveal her plans for a week after the november 6 elections failed to give @entity66 gain they wanted			0
it was a disappointing , but not unexpected result of a bitter year of elections that focused on the tight contests for president and control of the @entity68			0
throughout , @entity3 raised millions of dollars for @entity60 @entity4 candidates and insisted that the 25 seat gain was within reach			1
but in the end , @entity66 will gain at most eight seats and @entity111 will keep their majority			0
waiting in the wings of @entity60 ranks was @entity3 's deputy , @entity60 rep @entity45 of @entity164 , the party whip , whom she has known since they were congressional interns , and @entity168 democrat @entity46 , assistant to the @entity60 leader			1
@entity3 is the daughter and sister of former @entity171 mayors			0
her father , @entity172 , served as mayor of @entity171 for 12 years after representing the city for five terms in @entity24			0
her brother , @entity176 , also served as mayor			0
if @entity3 , 72 , had n't sought the @entity60 leadership post again , it probably would have gone to either rep. @entity45 of @entity164 or rep. @entity46 of @entity168			1
she said she did n't want to lose her place at the negotiating table with @entity70 , vice president @entity182 and @entity110			2
she said ' he thought of four men at that table ' would n't exactly square with her longtime goal to ' empower women in the workplace			0
' making history : @entity3 , of @entity102 , was the first female @entity4 speaker , a position she held between 2007 and 2011			1
