@entity16 , a one - time policy guru for mr @entity1 , warned the party lacks ‘ a sense of direction ’ and urged his leader to ‘ take a couple of novels rather than think - tank reports as his summer reading ’			1
@entity1 will today use another speech to declare that his ‘ central mission ’ is to ‘ rebuild faith in business and politics ’ a shadow minister said there had been too many ‘ wonkish ’ economic announcements that would not connect with real people – such as the devolution of business rates and plans for a new infrastructure commission			1
‘ voters just expect governments to do this stuff [ on the economy ] – they ’re not interested in all the wiring of how it works , ’ he said			1
bemoaning a string of presentational blunders , the mp added : ‘ we ’ve got people being paid an awful lot of money to get these things right , and they ’re not			0
