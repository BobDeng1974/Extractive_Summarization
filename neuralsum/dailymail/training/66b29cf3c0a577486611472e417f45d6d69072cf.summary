by @entity0 published : 22:56 est , 22 august 2012 updated : 23:58 est , 22 august 2012 @entity1 , the former @entity2 president who stepped down as a result of the @entity5 child - sex abuse scandal has denied that he ignored any warning signs during his tenure			1
citing his own child abuse at the hands of his father , the 64 - year - old former family therapist has come out fighting to restore his reputation after an independent report accused him of failing to prevent a ' child predator harming children for over a decade			1
' claiming that he does not know , ' anyone who had a higher level of awareness ' than himself , @entity1 spoke of the terrible injuries that he received at the hands of his father , which resulted in him having four surgeries as an adult to correct the damage to his nose			1
scroll down for @entity26 @entity1 spoke to @entity28 's @entity27 to explain that he did not cover - up @entity5 's sexual abuse while he was president of @entity2 ' it resulted in , of course , some emotional scarring , but also some substantial physical damage , ' said @entity1 to @entity27			1
rejecting out of hand the findings of july 's damning @entity37 , @entity1 calls its conclusions ' wrong ' and denied outright that ' he conspired to conceal a known child predator '			1
the former professor said that he was only told that @entity5 had engaged in ' horseplay ' with a boy in the team showers in 2001 and that his mind did not automatically think of sexual abuse			2
the @entity37 , which was commissioned by @entity2 openly questioned why @entity1 failed to begin any investigation into @entity5 's behaviour			1
@entity1 explained that he was very sensitive to any child abuse allegations after suffering physical abuse for years at the hands of his father as a young boy ' never in my time as president of @entity2 did i ever receive a report or even a hint that @entity5 was engaged in child abuse , a sexual act , criminal activity or anything resembling that with any child , ' said @entity1			1
' had i known that , or even suspected it , i would have forcefully intervened			0
but i never heard a report like that			0
' furthermore , @entity1 told @entity28 's @entity27 that he met @entity5 once only and was not fully involved with a police investigation into another earlier incident of child abuse conducted by @entity5 in 1998			1
' i do not get involved in police matters			0
i always had a very hands - off attitude and issues pertaining to people were dealt with by the police , by human resources , or by supervisors in various areas of the university , ' said @entity1 of the 1998 incident which at the time led to no charges against the former defensive coach			2
however , during the second 2001 incident , @entity1 received an email from athletic director @entity85 and retired vice president @entity86 that spoke of letting @entity5 off with a warning after he was caught with a boy in the showers			1
@entity1 agreed to this , but noted in an email that by failing to report it to the police , they would be ' vulnerable for not having reported it			2
' speaking to @entity27 , @entity1 said that his choice of words was unfortunate and that he had ' no recollection of being concerned ' that the school might be leaving itself open to be legally liable			0
' i never , ever heard anything about child abuse or sexual abuse or my antennae raised up enough to even suspect that			2
so i know that â€™s been taken out of context , and i suspect that whoever leaked those e-mails wanted them to be taken out of context , ' said @entity1 to the @entity112			0
@entity1 told @entity28 's @entity27 that he had little to no recollection of this meeting with @entity5 and only has one clear memory of ever speaking with him @entity2 president @entity1 and his lawyers also attacked the @entity119 report on the @entity120 on wednesday , calling it a ' blundering and indefensible indictment ' as they fired a pre-emptive strike while waiting to hear if he 'll be charged in the case			1
lawyer @entity125 called @entity119 , the former @entity126 director and federal judge behind the report , a ' biased investigator ' who piled speculation on top of innuendo to accuse @entity1 in a cover - up of early abuse complaints			1
' the @entity119 report , as it pertains to dr. @entity1 , is a myth			1
and that myth ... ends today , ' @entity125 said at a downtown @entity139 news conference			0
but he told media outlets in stories published hours later that he never understood the early complaints about @entity5 , who this year was convicted of molesting 10 boys , to be sexual			2
guilty : @entity1 's once pristine reputation has been ruined after a damning report accused him of conspiring to protect defensive coordinator @entity5 , who was convicted in june of multiple pedophilia charges ' i 'm very stunned by @entity119 's conclusion that - i do n't think he used the word ` cover - up ' ; but he uses the word ` concealed , '' @entity1 told @entity112 magazine			1
' why on earth would anybody cover up for a known child predator ? adverse publicity ? for heaven 's sake ! every day i had to make some decision that got adverse publicity			2
' @entity1 told @entity28 that he was told only that @entity5 had been seen engaging in ' horseplay ' in a campus shower with a boy and he took that to mean ' throwing water around , snapping towels			2
' ' i wish in hindsight that i would have known more about @entity5 and his terrible , terrible hidden past so that i could have intervened because it would have been my instinct to do so , ' he said			0
the @entity112 interview was published online after @entity170 began promoting its own interview with @entity1 , set to air in parts on several of its networks wednesday and thursday			0
sick : @entity5 ( left , seen here in 1990 ) was involved in a local charity which he went on to use as a way to find the boys that he would ' groom ' to be his victims at the news conference , @entity125 , also a former federal judge , complained that @entity119 never interviewed key witnesses , ignored inconvenient facts and manipulated the truth			1
for instance , he said , the report assumes former graduate assistant @entity188 told coach @entity189 in 2001 that he saw something sexual in a locker room shower and that @entity189 echoed that to athletic director @entity85 and vice president @entity192			0
@entity119 likewise , he said , assumes that they in turn told @entity1 the same thing			2
' @entity85 and @entity196 have denied that they ever told dr. @entity1 anything of the sort , ' @entity125 said			2
' ` @entity200 ' was referred to over and over again , but never with any sexual connotation or suggestion of abuse			0
but judge @entity119 paid no attention to that			0
' the @entity119 group said wednesday that it stands by its report			0
its investigation uncovered documents that suggest @entity1 had deeper knowledge of the early @entity5 complaints , including an email in which the president appeared to agree with @entity85 's decision to keep a 2001 assault from child - welfare authorities and instead work directly with @entity5 and @entity218 's charity for at - risk youths			1
@entity125 , defense lawyer for former @entity2 president @entity1 , speaks during a news conference wednesday , aug. 22 , 2012 , in @entity139 the ' @entity37 ' also pointed a finger at legendary football coach @entity189 who is accused of being complicit with @entity1 in ignoring @entity5 's actions ' the only downside for us is if the message is n't ` heard ' and acted upon , and we then become vulnerable for not having reported it , ' said @entity1 's email , dated feb. 27 , 2001			1
' the approach you outline is humane and a reasonable way to proceed			0
' @entity1 's four high - profile lawyers , who are being paid by @entity2 , argue that @entity119 took the email out of context			1
as for a 1998 report that @entity5 had showered with a boy - a complaint that led to a campus police investigation referred to county prosecutors - they note that prosecutors declined to charge @entity5			2
' there was thus nothing to conceal , ' the lawyers wrote in a rebuttal to the report released wednesday			0
@entity1 and @entity189 were ousted in november , days after @entity5 was charged			2
@entity5 , who maintains his innocence , awaits sentencing			0
@entity249 : much of @entity2 's growth and success over the past 50 years has derived from its stellar performances on the football field gone : the site outside @entity249 where @entity189 's statue once stood has been stripped of all monuments after workers uprooted the statue honouring the late coach @entity85 and @entity196 are charged with perjury and failing to report suspected child abuse ; they maintain their innocence , and their attorneys issued statements after wednesday 's broadcast also blasting the @entity119 report			1
@entity1 's lawyers said they do n't know whether he will be charged			0
' that 's out of our control , ' lawyer @entity269 said			0
a spokesman in the attorney general 's office has declined to comment on possible charges , while calling the @entity5 probe ' ongoing and active			0
' former @entity2 athletic director @entity85 ( left ) and retired vice president @entity86 are facing charges relating to perjury as a result of what they knew regarding @entity5 's abuse university trustee @entity284 , who attended the law firm news conference , said the board has never adopted @entity119 's report , unlike current university president @entity288			1
' i 'd love for us to come out with a statement that says , we 've never accepted this report , ' @entity284 said			0
with @entity288 's approval , the university has agreed to pay $ 60 million in @entity296 fines over the scandal			0
@entity1 , who remains a tenured faculty member at @entity2 , has told trustees he would never cover up abuse because he himself had been physically abused as a boy by his father , as a form of discipline			1
' someday i hope to have my name completely cleared when it becomes evident that this was unfair and untrue , ' @entity1 told @entity112 .			0

denied outright that ' he conspired to conceal a known child predator '
