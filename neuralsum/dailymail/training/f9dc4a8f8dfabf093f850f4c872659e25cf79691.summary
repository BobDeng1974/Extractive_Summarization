you might think cold sores are unsightly			2
but they could also increase the risk of @entity4 's , a new study suggests			0
@entity7 researchers found an infection of the herpes simplex virus 1 - which causes cold sores - doubles the risk of developing alzheimer 's disease			1
the body carries the virus forever after the first infection , and it can reactivate now and then , causing the crusty blisters known as cold sores			1
crusty : an infection of the herpes virus - which causes cold sores in as many as nine out of ten @entity20 at some point in their lives - doubles the risk of developing @entity4 's , according to a study while up to 90 per cent of adults have herpes simplex virus 1 lurking in their systems , only around a quarter of them will experience frequent outbreaks			1
the researchers say the virus could increase the risk of @entity4 's because elderly people have weakened immune systems , which creates opportunities for the virus to spread to the brain			1
in the brain , the virus can start the process which results in alzheimer 's disease			2
plaques are formed in the brain which result in the death of brain cells and the breakdown of the connections between them			0
this causes memory loss and the decline in the ability to think , which are the characteristic symptoms of @entity4 's			0
previous research suggests that people who do not get @entity4 ’s produce less amyloid - the substance which forms brain plaques - or are better at clearing it			0
professor @entity58 , from @entity59 in @entity7 , said the study findings could be used to develop treatment for the disease			0
he said : ' our results clearly show that there is a link between infections of herpes simplex virus and the risk of developing alzheimer 's disease			1
' this also means that we have new opportunities to develop treatment forms to stop the disease			0
' he added : ' something which makes this hypothesis very interesting is that now herpes infection can , in principle , be treated with antiviral agents			0
experts said the cold sore virus could increase the risk of @entity4 's as elderly people have weakened immune systems which allow the virus to spread to the brain more easily , where it can start the process of plaques forming in the brain which kill brain cells ' within a few years we hope to be able to start treating patients to prevent the development of alzheimer 's disease			1
' professor @entity58 and his team carried out two studies to prove the link between an infection with the herpes virus and @entity4 's			1
in the first study , 3,432 participants were followed for 11.3 years on average			0
they found that a reactivated herpes infection doubled the risk of developing alzheimer 's disease			2
in the second study , samples donated to @entity59 's @entity107 were analysed from 360 people with @entity4 's disease taken on average 9.6 years before they were diagnosed			2
the same number of samples from people who had not developed dementia were also analysed			0
researchers found a doubled risk of developing @entity4 's disease if the person was a carrier of the herpes virus .			1

cold sores are caused by an infection of the herpes simplex virus 1
after the first infection , the virus lives in the body forever
it is sometimes reactivated , causing the crusty blisters known as cold sores
*scientists* found a link between herpes virus and @entity4 's disease
could be because elderly people have a weakened immune system
this creates opportunities for the virus to spread to the brain
in the brain , virus can start the process which results in @entity4 's
