a mother says she must quit her job after her daughter was refused a place at a junior school 150 yards from their front door - and sent to one more than two miles away instead			1
seven - year - old @entity6 was told she can not attend @entity7 in @entity8 even though she can see it from her bedroom window			2
her mother @entity10 , 49 , who has two other children , claims taking her daughter to school and back every day would require four hours of travelling on the bus and force her to quit her job			1
unhappy : @entity6 , seven , was refused a place at a school 150 yards from her home and offered one two miles away , so her mother @entity10 , pictured together , must quit her job to ensure she gets there and back decision : the schoolgirl leaves across the street from her preferred school but instead will have to head to @entity22 , which is around two miles away mrs @entity6 had believed @entity23 in @entity8 , where @entity24 is a student , was a feeder school to @entity27 , so only put one school on @entity24 's admission form			1
the mother - who works in it for @entity32 and is married to financial planner @entity33 , 55 , - also believed the short distance from her home to the school would also be a deciding factor			1
but the council said the school @entity24 attends has never been a feeder school and advised parents to always submit three preferences when applying			1
@entity24 is in the catchment area but the school is oversubscribed , so children who also live in the area but go to the correct feeder school were given a place above her			1
mrs @entity6 is now planning to appeal the decision made by the authority after @entity24 was given a spot at @entity22 - more than two miles away			1
she said : ' i know that lots of parents are in similar positions but what is different here is that not only are we in catchment , we live about as close to the school as possible			0
rejected : @entity6 was refused a place at @entity7 ( above ) in @entity8 , even though she can see it from her bedroom window ' parents park outside our house when dropping their children off at @entity69			2
' the council uses an " as the crow flies " criteria for working out who lives nearer in the event of over subscription within catchment and if i look out of my landing window , all that stands between us and the school are the @entity83 flats and a couple of houses			0
' i 've been told @entity87 is no longer a feeder school and all the places have been allocated at other infant schools			2
' i have looked at bus timetables			0
i would n't be able to drop @entity24 off at school and get into town for work			2
it would take an hour and five minutes each way twice a day			0
i simply would n't be able to do it			0
' @entity98 , the council 's executive director of children , young people and families said : ' we do understand that it is difficult if a child can not be offered a place at their preferred school			2
' we always encourage parents to submit three preferences in case their first preference can not be accommodated			0
alternative : the seven - year - old was instead offered a place at @entity22 - more than two miles away ' @entity116 is not and has never been a linked feeder school to @entity7 and a member of the @entity119 attended @entity87 in october 2014 to offer help and advice to parents before applying			1
' if only one preference is submitted and can not be accommodated , a place may have to be offered at the nearest school with available places			2
this may be a school outside the catchment area , if no other preferences were requested			1
' if a family has specific reasons for seeking a place at an oversubscribed school they can submit an appeal to the independent appeals panel , which will convene in june and july			0
' mrs @entity6 said she has contacted her local prospective parliamentary candidates in deputy prime minister @entity140 's constituency of @entity141 - but has yet to receive a reply			1
she added : ‘ the school she has been allocated is down into one valley and down the other side			0
if we were to go by bus it would be a bus into town and then another one out			0
‘ it would take an hour and five minutes to get to school			0
we are appealing the decision but we wo n't find out until july what the outcome is , which is very late for us to plan and buy uniforms			0

@entity160 only applied for one school because it is only 150 yards away
but her daughter @entity24 has instead been offered place two miles away
her mother says she must leave job because she faces four hours on bus
@entity32 says mrs @entity6 *wrongly* assumed child was in a ' feeder school '
as a result , despite being in catchment area , @entity24 was refused place
