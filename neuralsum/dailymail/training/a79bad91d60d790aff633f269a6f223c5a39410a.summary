a virus that has killed nearly 800 dolphins has now shown up in four whales , which washed ashore off the @entity3 of @entity4			1
government marine experts are working to determine whether the virus - cetacean morbillivirus - was responsible for the deaths			1
if proven , the development would be of major concern to the global whale population , judging by the amount of dolphins the virus continues to kill			0
three humpback whales - which are listed as an endangered species - and one pygmy sperm whale have stranded since july 1			1
they were found on shores between @entity19 and @entity20 , according to the @entity21			0
troubling : three humpback whales - like this one - and one pygmy sperm whale have washed ashore infected with crustacean morbillivirus , a virus responsilbe for the death of close to 800 dolphins			1
experts are now trying to determine whether the virus was the cause of death for the whales just this year , there have been 14 whale strandings , which is double the six - year average of seven			1
this whale was found near @entity35 , @entity36 , on june 13 , 2013 @entity3 : the four infected whales washed ashore on the @entity3 of the @entity4 between @entity19 and @entity20 there have been 14 humpback strandings - when dead or dying animals wash ashore - along the @entity3 this year , which is double the six - year average of seven			1
however only four of the whales have been proven carriers of morbillivirus			2
while morbillivirus is known to infect whales , the @entity47 have never reported a death from it			2
the dolphin epidemic , however , continues to move at an unprecedented rate			0
between july 1 and sunday , 782 have been confirmed dead			2
that already surpasses the last major morbillivirus outbreak in 1987 , when 740 were confirmed dead			0
third of the day : @entity56 members @entity57 ( left ) and @entity58 ( right ) record their third deceased dolphin in @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity62 on aug. 1 , 2013 @entity63 from the @entity56 prepares for a necropsy on a dolphin that died from morbillivirus the virus causes death by suppressing the dolphin 's immune system , leaving them vulnerable to infections such as pneumonia			0
despite a similarity to the measles virus , it poses no threat to humans			2
sadly officials have said there is nothing they can do to protect dolphins in the wild			0
another round of dolphins have recently washed ashore in @entity84 , as they migrate south to warmer weather			1
however they have not been included in the virus tally because proper tests have not been conducted			0
@entity89 , a staffer at the @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity92 , photographs a dead dolphin that washed ashore on aug. 21 , 2013 , in @entity94			1
this dolphin was the 63rd to die on @entity92 's shores since july @entity97 , director of the marine mammal heath and stranding response program for the @entity47 's fisheries service , said it is too early to say whether whales are able to be infected			2
' there are too many unknowns right now , ' she told the @entity21			0
' we would be concerned if indeed there is an outbreak of this virus in humpback whales causing clinical disease and mortality			0

a strand of the morbillivirus - which causes measles in humans - is responsible for *wiping* out 782 since july , with the number *expected* to rise
four whales have now washed ashore off the @entity3 of the @entity4 infected with the virus
experts are *scrambling* to determine whether the virus killed them or if they were just carriers
@entity90 officials say nothing can be done to protect the animals from the virus
