the human eye is optimised to have good colour vision at day and high sensitivity at night			1
but until recently it seemed as if the cells in the retina were wired the wrong way round , with light travelling through a mass of neurons before it reaches the light - detecting rod and cone cells			1
new research presented at a meeting of the @entity14 has uncovered a remarkable vision - enhancing function for this puzzling structure			1
@entity19 researchers studied human retinas ( image of an eye interior shown )			1
they looked at why cells in our retinas are wired the wrong way round			1
light travels through a mass of neurons before it reaches the ' back '			1
the research suggests the structure appears to enhance our vision about a century ago , the fine structure of the retina was discovered			1
the retina is the light - sensitive part of the eye , lining the inside of the eyeball			2
the back of the retina contains cones to sense the colours red , green and blue			2
spread among the cones are rods , which are much more light - sensitive than cones , but which are colour - blind			0
before arriving at the cones and rods , light must traverse the full thickness of the retina , with its layers of neurons and cell nuclei			1
these neurons process the image information and transmit it to the brain , but until recently it has not been clear why these cells lie in front of the cones and rods , not behind them			1
the human eye can see more that we thought , researchers said in december			1
it had previously been believed the human eye can not see infrared light , in the same way we ca n't see x-rays and radio waves			1
however , researchers have revealed that under certain conditions , the retina can sense infrared light after all			2
an international team of researchers co-led by scientists at @entity77 in @entity78 used cells from the retinas of mice and people			1
by firing powerful lasers that emit pulses of infrared light , the researchers found that when laser light pulses rapidly , light - sensing cells in the retina sometimes get a double hit of infrared energy			1
when that happens , the eye is able to detect light that falls outside the visible spectrum			0
this is a long - standing puzzle , even more so since the same structure , of neurons before light detectors , exists in all vertebrates , showing evolutionary stability			1
researchers in @entity103 found that glial cells , which also span the retinal depth and connect to the cones , have an interesting attribute			2
these cells are essential for metabolism , but they are also denser than other cells in the retina			0
in the transparent retina , this higher density ( and corresponding refractive index ) means that glial cells can guide light , just like fibre - optic cables			2
in view of this , my colleague @entity117 and i built a model of the retina , and showed that the directional of glial cells helps increase the clarity of human vision.but we also noticed something rather curious : the colours that best passed through the glial cells were green to red , which the eye needs most for daytime vision			1
the eye usually receives too much blue - and thus has fewer blue - sensitive cones			0
further computer simulations showed that green and red are concentrated five to ten times more by the glial cells , and into their respective cones , than blue light			2
instead , excess blue light gets scattered to the surrounding rods			0
this surprising result of the simulation now needed an experimental proof			0
with colleagues at the @entity150 , we tested how light crosses guinea pig retinas			2
the back of the retina contains cones to sense the colours red , green and blue			0
spread among the cones are rods , which are much more light - sensitive than cones , but which are colour - blind			0
before arriving at the cones and rods , light must traverse the full thickness of the retina , with its layers of neurons and cell nuclei like humans , these animals are active during the day and their retinal structure has been well - characterised , which allowed us to simulate their eyes just as we had done for humans			1
then we passed light through their retinas and , at the same time , scanned them with a microscope in three dimensions			2
this we did for 27 colours in the visible spectrum			0
the result was easy to notice : in each layer of the retina we saw that the light was not scattered evenly , but concentrated in a few spots			0
these spots were continued from layer to layer , thus creating elongated columns of light leading from the entrance of the retina down to the cones at the detection layer			0
light was concentrated in these columns up to ten times , compared to the average intensity			0
even more interesting was the fact that the colours that were best guided by the glial cells matched nicely with the colours of the cones			0
the cones are not as sensitive as the rods , so this additional light allowed them to function better â€“ even under lower light levels			0
meanwhile , the bluer light , that was not well - captured in the glial cells , was scattered onto the rods in its vicinity			2
these results mean that the retina of the eye has been optimised so that the sizes and densities of glial cells match the colours to which the eye is sensitive ( which is in itself an optimisation process suited to our needs )			0
this optimisation is such that colour vision during the day is enhanced , while night - time vision suffers very little			0
the effect also works best when the pupils are contracted at high illumination , further adding to the clarity of our colour vision .			0
