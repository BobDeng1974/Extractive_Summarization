by @entity0 published : 18:02 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 13:03 est , 29 march 2013 on the attack : veteran broadcaster baroness @entity3 it 's hardly a surprise these days when two female tv stars are involved in a public @entity7 , that is , they have a combined age of 157			1
the warring pair are presenter @entity3 , 79 , and cake - maker supreme @entity10 , 78 - year - old hostess of the @entity12			1
and the issue in question is women ’s rights			2
despite their closeness in age , their opinions are deeply different			0
@entity20 has launched a stinging attack on miss @entity10 ’s lifestyle , saying she belongs in ‘ a completely different world ’			1
renowned for her liberal attitudes towards sex and for an illicit affair with playwright @entity27 , the @entity29 peeress once known as the ‘ thinking man ’s crumpet ’ contrasted her own ‘ whizzy ’ life with miss @entity10 ’s ‘ stable and unchanging ’ world view			1
she was responding to comments the cookery writer made in january			0
dismissing feminism as a ‘ dirty word ’ , miss @entity10 insisted she did not want women ’s rights and said she loves it when men offer to carry her coat			1
‘ when i read that , i felt that @entity10 belonged in a completely different world , ’ fumed @entity20			1
‘ what she said sounded very lovely and cosy and rural , and very stable and unchanging			1
i thought that was fine for her			0
‘ but perhaps i have lived a bit more of a whizzy life out and about , and my life has been a little bit more rackety			1
of course feminism has mattered a great deal to me and matters still			1
‘ i think @entity10 would expect to be paid a decent wage for the job she does and she would probably expect to be paid as much as a man			1
so to that extent she is a feminist without realising it			1
’ recipe for success : cake expert @entity10 @entity3 rose to fame in 1965 as the presenter of @entity63 ’s @entity62 , which became renowned for its open discussions of taboo subjects including sex , abortion , divorce and homosexuality			1
it was later revealed she had a seven - year affair with playwright @entity27 while they were both married			1
twice divorced , she now lives alone in @entity73 , north @entity74			0
miss @entity10 ’s career and personal life , on the other hand , has followed a much more traditional trajectory			1
in 1966 , she published the @entity79 and wed @entity80			0
they have three children and are still married			0
miss @entity10 , whose work includes a celebrated recipe for @entity85 , said she loves it when men offer to fetch her coat or give up their seat on the bus , adding : ‘ i ’m thrilled to bits			1
i ’m not a feminist			1
’ the claws are out : @entity3 , right , said that @entity10 , left , ' belonged in a completely different world ' when @entity95 said that feminist is a ' dirty word ' but @entity20 insisted such gestures should be ‘ common decency ’ for both sexes			1
she said : ‘ men do n’t offer to open the door for me any more			1
but the opening of doors and things is really a matter of courtesy , and i am really rather in favour of courtesy			0
i think you have to be polite to each other whatever your gender			0
it is just common decency and manners between individuals			0
‘ i always share the bill at restaurants , though i am perhaps somewhat old for what you might call a date			2
i go out for meals with male friends			0
sometimes the very rich ones pay			0
very different women : a young @entity10 , left , has always followed a traditional lifestyle , whereas the life of @entity3 , right , has been ' rackety ' as @entity3 describes it ' some of them are inclined to be particularly chivalrous			1
but chivalry is a little bit out of date because it suggests all these superior , protective roles for men			0
‘ i think good manners between grown - ups and indeed between children is desirable			1
if there is a gender - free way of defining it then that suits me better			2
you can call it chivalry if you like			0
’ this summer , @entity20 will present a programme called @entity147			2
family values : @entity10 with her children @entity149 , @entity151 and @entity152 alongside comedian @entity153 she will hunt for the @entity155 ’s best portrait artist in an open competition held at art fairs across the nation			1

@entity20 said she was surprised to be offered the work , adding : ‘ there are no television programmes for old people			2
you tend to be shunted across to radio as you get older			0
