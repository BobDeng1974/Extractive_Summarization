dr @entity0 says she is seeing more and more childless women being taken advantage of by their friends with children not a week goes by these days without a story about fertility			1
we know that many women choose to have children later in life these days and of course that many others simply decide that motherhood is not for them			1
but , have you ever noticed just how many mums will call upon their childless friends and relatives to look after their children - often thinking it 's okay to ask them to do so at the drop of a hat ? i have			1
i 'm really quite staggered by some of the mothers i 've met who downright take advantage of the childless women in their lives to babysit for them - repeatedly and at a moment 's notice - and to play auntie to their children			1
take a 40 - something entrepreneur i met recently at a conference			2
impeccably dressed and obviously a successful businesswoman we got talking about juggling careers with children			0
she described how she ’d never had to worry about hiring a nanny seeing as her business is operated online from her home - based office			0
plus she had an old friend who ’d never had children and has always stepped in for babysitting duties			0
nothing remarkable in that you might think , but then she then spouted on about how this friend had never seemed to realise that she was a bit taken advantage of			2
in fact this mother enthused about how there could be nothing better than a practically built - in babysitter you could absolutely trust			0
she said her friend had never met ‘ the one ’ to have children and evidently craved a sense of being loved by children			0
apparently she ’d drop any plans just to have some of that precious feeling that @entity61 ’s children needed her			0
i did n’t press her on any guilty feelings she might have over this situation because clearly she had none			0
and increasingly i 've been struck by the number of times i 've come across this rather sad state of affairs perhaps because i ’m coming across more childless women - and the mothers all too willing to take advantage			1
with women postponing having children until much later , fertility issues have been an unfortunate and heart - breaking side - effect for many			2
dr @entity0 says that many mothers are aware of the fact that they are taking advantage of their friends when they ask them to baby sit yes , of course many childless women – who wanted children - come to terms with this and lead completely fulfilled lives but there are those who are quite desperate to be part of their friends ’ children 's lives			1
some want to feel the children they volunteer to look after will love them back			0
thus fulfilling some sense of maternal - child love by proxy			0
you might argue it does n't matter because both women are getting something from these arrangements			2
however i do think it matters when a mother knows full well what she 's doing when taking advantage of a childless friend			1
and if said friend knew the mother cared less about their friendship and more about having a babysitter on - tap ( that is free and trustworthy ) the childless friend would probably feel deeply hurt			1
take one client , i ’ll call @entity116 , who told me how a childless friend was a " soft touch " ( her words )			2
since @entity116 's divorce she 's left her two children with this friend for entire weekends so she could spend them with her new boyfriend			0
@entity116 did n't seem to have many scruples about taking advantage in this way			2
because i was coaching her on better communication in relationships i pressed @entity116 on the dynamics of this relationship			0
did her friend realise she was incredibly convenient for @entity116 , did @entity116 feel she received more from this babysitting arrangement than her friend , and so on			0
dr @entity0 's book gives advice on how to deal with unhappy relationships our conversation struck a nerve and @entity116 seemed to wake up to the fact her friend was important to her and she ’d be a little more selective about asking for favours and more respectful of their relationship			1
other women have in passing recounted tales of their childless friends who will do anything to spend time with their children			1
it can at times seem utterly selfish and a one - way street			0
no one would want to feel they were being used in this way , especially a woman who has already experienced a great sense of loss over being childless			2
in my own experience one of my closest friends chose to remain childless as her career involves lots of travel			1
career always came first for her and she ’s been a wonderful presence in my children 's lives			0
but i would never have considered taking advantage of her good will			2
and , as i said , it was @entity176 ’s choice not to have children so she 's hardly what you 'd call ' desperate to look after children '			0
i know there are other mothers who would never take advantage in this way , but i ’m not concerned with them here			1
ultimately these relationships should be a level playing field , the ground rules should be fair			0
no childless woman should ever be taken advantage of in this way			1
my advice to childless women is do n’t feel you have to drag yourself from pillar to post to be an on - tap , unpaid babysitter			1
yes , absolutely enjoy the time you have with your friends ’ children but make sure it ’s an equitable , fair relationship			2
to the mothers who might put a guilty conscience on hold just to get that free babysitting i say how would you feel being taken advantage of in this way ? can you treat your friend with more respect ? what can you do for them in return ? and consider how you ’d feel if you lost their friendship if they caught on to the fact you have little respect for their needs			1
happy , balanced relationships benefit all concerned			0
