@entity1 staff have been ordered to take down ‘ inappropriate ’ @entity3 bunting and scolded for breaking health and safety rules by ‘ standing on tables and chairs ’ to put it up			1
in an extraordinary leaked email , workers in the @entity10 and the @entity11 are told that it is ‘ clearly not sensible ’ to have put up jubilee decorations			1
they are also warned that it is ‘ potentially embarrassing ’ for the government if office walls are revealed to be ‘ strewn with non-work - related posters and notices ’ – and further reprimanded for using colour printers to make the decorations in breach of eco-friendly workplace rules			1
still flying the flag : @entity25 remains at the @entity11 despite the stern edict against bunting staff are told bunting must be removed – though they are warned that they ‘ should n’t attempt to take it down themselves ’ and advised to call a helpdesk			1
one member of staff said the message had initially been assumed to be a joke but had caused widespread anger when it was established that it was genuine			2
the government has launched a concerted effort to rein in @entity41 ’s health and safety culture , making the message leaked to the @entity43 from the heart of @entity1 still more embarrassing			1
last night , after the @entity43 brought the warning to the attention of chancellor @entity48 , the edict was overruled			0
he told staff that they should ignore the instructions and encouraged them to ‘ cover the building ’ with jubilee bunting			2
staff were warned that non-work - related posters should be removed from offices to avoid potential embarrassment for the government a policeman stands guard in front of the bunting - adorned @entity65 front door despite the banning of bunting elsewhere in @entity1 , @entity66 displayed its colours with pride at the start of the @entity3 celebrations this weekend an aide to mr @entity48 said : ‘ as loyal servants to @entity74 , the chancellor was delighted to hear officials have got into the @entity77 in such a way			1
the bunting is still up and is staying up			0
' employment minister @entity80 , who is responsible for health and safety law , said : ‘ no one anywhere in the country should feel that they ca n’t have bunting and decorations up to celebrate the jubilee			1
health and safety law is all about protecting people in high - risk workplaces			1
it is not about ruining the fun of the jubilee			0
’ @entity96 mp @entity95 said : ‘ this is typical of the killjoys and jobsworths that pervade parts of @entity1 and the civil service			0
’ the email was sent on thursday by @entity103 , head of ‘ supplier management ’ at an organisation named @entity106 , a division of the @entity11			2
@entity108 the @entity66 cat appears to do his best to comply with the @entity1 edict to remove ' inappropriate bunting ' addressing staff on a shared floor of the @entity10 and the @entity11 , she wrote : ‘ i note that some of the teams have decorated the area with bunting that has been strung from the ceiling and light fittings			1
i assume this was put up by standing on tables and chairs – clearly not sensible from a @entity124 aspect and not something we want to encourage			2
‘ it ’s also not appropriate to tie anything to the light fittings			0
as well as the @entity124 concerns , the appearance of this is n’t appropriate to a professional workplace – particularly a multi-occupancy building like this			0
the bunting needs to be removed and i ’d be grateful if you could speak to whoever is responsible			0
however staff should n’t attempt to take it down themselves – please ensure that they call the helpdesk instead			0
’ mrs @entity103 expressed further concern that some of the @entity145 appeared to have been made from ‘ @entity146 coloured printed pages which i assume have been produced on the @entity148 ’			0
she added : ‘ if this is the case , then could you also please remind your colleagues that that ’s not an appropriate use of these fairly expensive resources … colour printing needs to be used sparingly and only for work purposes			0

email appears to fly in the face of the government *'s* attempts to clamp down on health and safety culture
