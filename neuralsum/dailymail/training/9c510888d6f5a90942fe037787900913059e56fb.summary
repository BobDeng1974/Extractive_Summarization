@entity1 travel to @entity2 in the @entity4 last - 16 first leg at @entity5 on tuesday night knowing that the biggest threat to their progress is talismanic striker @entity9			1
the @entity10 international is no stranger to the extraordinary and his career - spanning 16 years and seven clubs , including spells at @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 - is littered with ridiculous and sublime goals			1
here , @entity19 reminds you of ten of @entity9 's best strikes			1
@entity9 jumps for joy after scoring arguably his best goal against @entity25 at @entity26 the @entity10 international has enjoyed huge success at a number of top clubs , including @entity30 @entity31 vs @entity32 , 2004 - 05 @entity9 made a name for himself as a scorer of great goals during his three - year spell with @entity37 giants @entity31 , and they do n't get much better than this			1
the striker showed his power and skill in equal measure as he danced through the @entity32 backline embarrassing several defenders and the goalkeeper on his way to slotting home			0
@entity49 vs @entity17 , 2005 - 06 @entity9 's exploits at @entity31 soon led to @entity52 's elite casting their eye on the unpredictable striker , who made a big - money move to @entity57 heavyweights @entity17			1
in his first season at the club @entity9 scored 16 league goals including this beauty against @entity49			1
the striker produced a brilliant improvised flick before bullying the defender with brute strength and firing past the keeper with the outside of his boot			0
@entity69 vs @entity17 , 2005 - 06 during the same season @entity9 scored this absolute worldy against @entity69 in the @entity4 when he latched on to nothing more than a hopeful punt up field			1
the forward out - muscles his opponent before spinning in behind and unleashing a ferocious volley from 25 yards with his , supposedly , weaker left foot that ends with both the ball and the keeper in the back of the net			0
@entity30 vs @entity81 , 2008 - 09 after two successful seasons at @entity17 the club were relegated to @entity85 following the uncovering of the @entity88 scandal and while several big - name players remained at the , the @entity57 second tier was n't for @entity9			1
he moved to @entity30 and continued where he left off adding this wonderful near - post back heel volley to his burgeoning collection of stunning goals			2
@entity30 vs @entity95 , 2008 - 09 @entity9 again turned to the unorthodox method of using the back of his foot as he scored the winner in a seven - goal thriller against @entity95			2
the chance appeared to be gone but as @entity9 stumbled under the challenge of a defender , with his back to goal , he swung his heel back and stunned the goalkeeper , who remained rooted to the spot			0
@entity30 vs @entity109 , 2008 - 09 @entity9 has scored a number of brilliant free kicks during his career , but this one makes the selection for its sheer power and accuracy			2
the striker placed the ball a full 40 yards from goal and struck it with such power that it was past the keeper in a heartbeat			0
the bend on the ball and the fact it cannoned in off the crossbar only add to the spectacle			0
@entity129 vs @entity15 2010 - 11 not too dissimilar to his earlier goal against @entity69 for @entity17 , the then @entity15 striker created a stunning goal out of absolutely nothing			0
@entity9 raced on to a clearance , bursting past one defender with great pace , before barging another out the way and finally sending a controlled lobbed volley over the goalkeeper , who was no more than three yards off his line			2
@entity10 vs @entity142 , 2012 during the 2012 @entity143 scored another technically brilliant goal as @entity10 beat @entity142 2 - 0 , and even helped @entity25 top @entity145 a hopeful cross from the @entity10 right arrived to @entity9 just inside the penalty area and the striker acrobatically connected with a flying volley that flew past @entity151			2
@entity25 vs @entity10 , 2012 - 13 arguably @entity9 's best goal came against @entity25 at @entity26			1
it may have only been a friendly but the @entity10 international won the 2013 @entity155 with this over-head kick from the best part of 35 yards			0
granted , he had a little help from @entity159 , who rushed out of his area only to head the ball about 10 yards clear , but take nothing away from the finish as @entity9 instinctively reacted by acrobatically sending it back towards the goal with a flying propeller kick			0
@entity167 vs @entity2 , 2012 - 13 finally , it 's another one from @entity9 's collection of unorthodox volleys , this time for current club @entity2 during a @entity172 clash against @entity167			1
a corner is swung into the box and @entity9 holds off the defender and shows remarkable control to flick the ball past the keeper with an incredible amount of power and accuracy .			0
