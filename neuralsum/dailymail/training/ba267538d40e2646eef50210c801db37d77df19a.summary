by @entity0 published : 01:15 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 02:20 est , 7 november 2013 the remains of a new super-predator dinosaur that roamed the @entity3 80 million years ago has been discovered by scientists in @entity5			1
paleontologists believe the dinosaur , which had been named the ' king of gore ' , was the largest living predator of its time with a big skull and huge teeth			2
bones of the 24 - foot - long dinosaur were unveiled at the @entity16 in @entity17 yesterday			1
it is believed to have lived 10 million years before its slightly larger relative , the @entity21			1
super-predator : an artist 's rendering of the newly - discovered dinosaur , @entity25 argestes , whose fossils have been found in southern @entity5 new discovery : the fossilized skeleton of a newly - discovered dinosaur , @entity25 argestes , on the display at the @entity33 of @entity5 scientists hope the find will help them better understand the ecosystem where the predator roamed			2
discovered by workers for the @entity39 in eastern @entity5 in 2009 , scientists named the animal @entity25 , or ' king of gore , ' for its large teeth and apparent dominance as a predator			1
' discovering the @entity25 pushes back the evolution of the group that gives rise to @entity21 , which is something we did n't understand before , ' said @entity51 , a geologist at the @entity52 , who led the dig for the new dinosaur			2
' @entity25 is like the great - uncle of @entity21			2
' paleontologists have thought that members of the group with characteristics like @entity21 - large bodies , tiny arms , thick skulls and forward facing eyes - dated as far back as 70 million years , but the @entity25 shows signs of being at least 80 million years old			1
' great uncle ' : the newly - discovered dinosaur is believed to predate the @entity21 by 10 million years deadly : the skull of the dinosaur can be seen with the original bones in the foreground with a model of what scientists believe the new species of tyrannosaur looked like like its relative , the @entity25 is believed to have been the top predator of its time , roaming a stretch of land from @entity81 to @entity82 , including parts of @entity5 , during the @entity85 stage of the @entity86			1
' the really cool thing is that this shows that the origins of the last known tyrannosaurs were in the southern part of @entity91 as opposed to @entity92 or far @entity91 , ' as previously thought , said @entity93 , curator at the @entity94 in @entity95 , @entity96			0
photos of the fossil remains of the newly discovered species were sent to @entity51 and his team soon after they were discovered at the southern end of the @entity102 , on the @entity5 - @entity104 border			0
the group spent the following two years retrieving , preserving and assembling the bones			0
then , they traveled to locations where other bones from the tyrannosaur group were being studied , including @entity111 ; @entity112 , @entity113 ; @entity114 ; and @entity115			0
the 24 - foot - long dinosaur is believed to have been the top predator of its time around 80 million years ago the @entity25 bones were set between layers of volcanic ash , which allowed scientists to determine the age of the dinosaur by studying the decomposition of the ash crystals that surrounded them			1
' this sort of discovery is very interesting and exciting because it 's not just another animal from that era but a large predator from that era , ' said paleontologist @entity133 , who studies the ecology of dinosaur periods for the @entity136			0
@entity133 said being able to learn about the @entity25 will reveal more about the ecosystem at the time of its reign			0
' this is going to change our understanding of this older ecosystem , ' @entity133 said			0
