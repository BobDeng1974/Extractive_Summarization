@entity0 sparked confusion after she was spotted carrying a rather dated looking flip phone last week , but it appears she has traded it in for something more modern			2
at @entity9 's @entity8 presentation on monday , the @entity6 editor was pictured sitting in the front row clutching a @entity12 cup in one hand and an iphone in the other			1
the 64 - year - old fashion maven attended the show in a feminine floral dress and her favorite nude slingbacks , keeping warm with a yellow cardigan draped over her back			1
she peered out from her signature dark sunglasses to look more closely at the tiny screen on the phone , which looked to be a $ 15 pay - as - you go phone from @entity46			2
signature style : the 64 - year - old attended the show in a feminine floral dress and her favorite nude slingbacks but judging by the photos of her today using a much more up - to - date gadget , it appears she may have a whole collection of phones to pick and choose from			1
perhaps she was saving the photo space on her @entity14 for snapping pictures at @entity8			1
the flip phone model she was using , an @entity60 , has a small two - inch display screen and offers texting and calling but no apps			2
old - fashioned : in between cheering on players at the @entity38 last thursday , @entity6 editor - in - chief @entity0 was pictured glancing at her cell phone - a rather dated looking flip phone odd choice : her decision to use such an old - fashioned phone is something of a surprise considering ms @entity0 presumably has the most cutting - edge products at her fingertips retro : the 64 - year - old was seen peering out from her signature dark sunglasses to look more closely at the tiny screen on the phone , which appears to be a $ 15 pay - as - you go phone from @entity46 ( pictured ) her decision to use such a simple and inexpensive was something of a surprise considering ms @entity0 presumably has the most cutting - edge products at her fingertips			1
by @entity83 @entity0 is believed to be using the @entity60 , a retro - styled ' flip ' handset available on @entity46 's pay as you go ' @entity60 ' service for just $ 14.99			1
it offers texting and access to some email accounts - but no apps			2
it 's unlikely @entity0 is able to take a decent snap either - the handset only has a vga camera with a resolution of less than a megapixel - far less than those found in modern phones			1
@entity46 boasts it will ' bring a nice balance of features and design to your fingertips			2
' perhaps the editor , who is known to be a creature of habit , simply likes to stick with what she knows best			1
indeed , back in 2004 she was seen using a similar flip phone while watching a @entity110 runway show , although that particular model looked even more retro with an antenna			1
by 2007 , she graduated to a somewhat sleeker model - the @entity114 , which she brandished proudly at yet another fashion show			1
from 2009 to 2012 , ms @entity0 was pictured multiple times using a @entity117 , and it seemed she had finally found a modern phone she liked			2
and just last year , she was seen carrying around both a @entity117 and an @entity14 , a symbol of her busy business life			0
so it 's a mystery as to why she would have downgraded back to a flip phone to watch the tennis this year			1
still stylish : sitting next to @entity126 at the match , she looked typically chic in a floral patterned dress and maroon cardigan , her hair styled in her usual sleek bob sitting next to @entity126 at the match , ms @entity0 looked typically chic in a floral patterned dress and maroon cardigan , her hair styled in her usual sleek bob			0
the usually steely mother - of - two let her guard down to cheer excitedly for the tennis players , throwing her fists in the air and smiling at each exciting moment of the match			0
the lively experience was likely a welcome break for ms @entity0 , who had been busy preparing for @entity8 , which officially began on thursday			1
as arguably the most respected editor in the fashion industry , she has been observing many of the big shows from the front row			1
though it may be easy to mock ms @entity0 's low - tech choice of phone , she may actually be on the money			1
a recent trend observed by @entity152 has seen classic 1990s models by @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 commanding four - figure sums on @entity158 and other resale sites			0
while they may lack features , these retro phones are simple to use , have batteries that last the week and are practically indestructible compared to their smartphone equivalents			0
‘ some people do n't blink at the prices , we have models at more than € 1,000 ( £ 810 or $ 1,360 ) , ’ said @entity165 , who started the site vintagemobile.fr in 2009			0
‘ the high prices are due to the difficulty in finding those models , which were limited editions in their time			0
’ @entity177 online shop @entity175 , which sells a range of vintage , revamped mobile phones , claims simplicity is the way forward			0
‘ too many online social networks and an excess of email and applications , have made us slaves to technology in our everyday life , ’ it said on its website			0
‘ we have two types of profiles : the 25 to 35 year - olds attracted by the retro and offbeat side of a telephone that is a little different , and those who are nostalgic for the phone that they used when they were younger , ’ said @entity194 , who founded @entity175 in 2010			0
‘ some use it to complement their smartphone , but others are going for the vintage , tired of the technology race between the phone makers			0
’ here are some of the retro phones making a comeback : @entity214 130 : a model launched in 1998 - and repainted bright orange was recently offered for € 180 ( £ 145 or $ 245 )			0
ironically , the trend is just starting as the telecommunications industry throws such handsets into the recycling bins , hailing smartphones as the way ahead			0
@entity214 130 , $ 245 @entity154 8210 : has a tiny monochrome screen and plastic buttons , at € 59.99 ( £ 48 or $ 80 )			0
@entity225 firm @entity154 , the biggest mobile phone company before the advent of @entity227 's @entity14 or @entity229 's @entity228 , offloaded its handset division to @entity231 this year after failing to catch the smartphone wave @entity233 , $ 80 @entity154 : currently listed for € 1,000 ( £ 810 or $ 1,360 ) , while a @entity234 could be purchased for € 250 ( £ 200 or $ 337 )			2
