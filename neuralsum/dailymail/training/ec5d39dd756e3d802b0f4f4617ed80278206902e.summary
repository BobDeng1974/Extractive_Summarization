by @entity0 published : 14:27 est , 5 february 2014 @entity2 : 16:04 est , 5 february 2014 he learned about aeroplanes on the internet , then built one in his yard out of scrap metal			1
but despite five years ' work and a lot of chutzpah , @entity9 it consultant @entity8 has been thwarted yet again in his bid to fly a homemade craft - complete with wings , propeller , a cockpit and even go - faster stripes			1
dozens of friends helped push the married father - of - two 's contraption through the dusty @entity9 countryside until its landing gear collapsed and it spluttered to a halt , to the sound of laughing children			1
he has made more than 10 scrap metal planes in his front yard but none have ever flown it 's working ! the plane , complete with go - faster stripes , picked up speed and left the neighbours behind failure : just as the flight looked like a success , the plane 's landing gear began to buckle under its weight back to the drawing board : one onlooker jumped over the tail as the planed collapsed the part - time entrepreneur has already made more than 10 planes but has never managed to get any of them off the ground , @entity9 news website @entity56 reported			1
many of his prototypes have been deemed too heavy , while another crashed on two concrete poles and broke a propeller			0
yet despite the latest setback , he insists he will keep trying to get himself airborne			2
he told @entity9 news channel @entity63 : ' i will go back to the drawing board and design the landing gear better , and also study a little bit more about landing gear			1
' the it consultant , whose firm @entity70 is based in the @entity9 capital @entity72 , found scrap aluminium bars , hollow tubes , bolts and plastic sheeting to make his planes - sticking it all together with some gum			1
he has spent more than a million @entity9 shillings ( Â £ 7,100 ) on his hobby and learned almost everything he knows on the internet			2
must try harder : mr @entity8 told an interviewer he would go back and study how landing gear worked hobbyist : gabriel with one of his earlier prototypes , complete with a wooden propeller efforts : the entrepreneur has made more than 10 scrap metal planes , but many have been too heavy to fly he said in an earlier interview : ' my boyhood interest was in aviation so maybe it was a missed career that i 'm trying to recreate '			1
his plane is powered by an engine which was once used to mill animal feed			0
if and when @entity87 finally succeeds in his mission he could be named as the first @entity9 ever to successfully fly a homemade aeroplane			2
a hardcore set of young , male hobbyists in @entity106 are busy trying to beat him to the title			0
farmhand @entity109 , from the @entity72 district of @entity112 , managed to build a 25kg helicopter from scrap material which he flew a foot off the ground - but was fired when his boss said the media attention was distracting him from his work			1
the enthusiasts often hope their prowess will gain them attention from engineering firms in wealthier parts of @entity125 which could fund a new life			0
success story : @entity128 , 24 , won a scholarship to study aircraft maintenance in the @entity131 after he made this bright yellow helicopter using a @entity134 engine in @entity135 , @entity136 , in 2007 dedicated : young men in @entity136 try to make their own aircraft , but few gain success or international attention one success story is of 24 - year - old @entity136 physics student @entity142 , who spent nearly a year building a 39ft long helicopter out of spare parts sourced from old cars , motorcycles , and even a crashed @entity147			2
he used money he saved from repairing cell phones and computers			0
his bright yellow contraption - with a salvaged @entity134 engine - was completed in 2007 and could reach heights of 7ft			0
it helped secure him a scholarship to study aircraft maintenance in the @entity131			0
the men 's trial - and - error approach is reminiscent of early experiments by the @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163			0
the @entity165 inventors made more than 1,000 test flights using gliders before they first managed to get a self - propelled plane off the ground on december 17 , 1903 .			0

married father - of - two @entity8 builds scrap metal planes in his yard
despite five years ' work his latest invention *flopped* near @entity72 , @entity9
he *refused* to be beaten , saying he will do some more studying on the web
