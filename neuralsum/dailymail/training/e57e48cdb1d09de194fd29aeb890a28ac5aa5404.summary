@entity0 will name his first @entity2 squad since the @entity3 a week on thursday			1
@entity4 should be in it			1
even if he is only there for the ride , to train in an environment with established internationals , this outstanding young talent needs to get a feel of what is to come			0
he does n’t need to play and there is no pressure to cap him , but training with @entity2 ’s elite can only benefit him			1
@entity17 has , quite rightly , formed a human shield around @entity20 ’s young central defender			1
this was another special night			0
at the age of 19 , the £ 16m recruit from @entity44 has been @entity20 ’s best player in their opening two matches			1
think about that for a moment			0
in a team laced with talent , from the former @entity52 forward @entity53 to @entity54 to the match - winning midfielder @entity55 ( sent off last night ) , @entity30 has topped the lot			2
he shows remarkable composure , reading the game like an old pro during a tasty and sometimes fiery battle with @entity63 in the @entity64			0
the former @entity66 striker thought he could pick on him , seeking him out in the opening minutes of this @entity25 qualifier			1
@entity30 was more than ready for him			0
it comes to something when @entity30 was pushing his more experienced team - mate @entity32 around , talking him into position when @entity26 broke forward			1
raising the @entity63 : the @entity20 youngster competes in the air with former @entity66 striker @entity63 protest : @entity30 ( left ) talks to @entity79 referee @entity78 as @entity63 ( right ) looks on there were shades of @entity82 about his block tackle on the edge of the area 35 minutes in , waiting for the right moment to stop @entity63 bulldozing his way into the box			1
his positioning is first class , always alert as he makes his first steps at the very highest level			0
they are anything but tentative			0
this was n’t a faultless performance , but that would be asking too much of a player who has spent his entire career at @entity44 playing at right back			1
still , he learns fast			0
there will be mild frustration with his failure to clear properly , exposed at the back when @entity63 was breathing down his neck on the stroke of half - time			2
experience will tell him to clear the decks , but he miscued and allowed @entity63 to make his way into the penalty area			0
he will learn to never go to ground , but the @entity26 forward fired wide			2
kid 's play : @entity117 defender @entity116 won the @entity25 last season aged 21 at 19 , @entity30 is thriving in the environment at @entity20 and learning , quickly , to accept the challenges of being a player at the top level			1
at @entity117 , the young @entity124 central defender @entity116 won his first @entity126 title two years ago and played a full game in the @entity25 victory against @entity129 at the age of 21			2
@entity116 already has 11 caps for @entity124 and he is being used carefully and considerately by his club manager @entity132			2
@entity17 has , quite rightly , promised to throw a protective cloak around @entity30 and he will be due a rest when @entity135 is fully fit after returning from the @entity3			0
take a bow : @entity30 was arguably man of the match on his league debut against @entity140 teenage kicks : the 19 - year - old has impressed his @entity20 teammates with his ability remember the days leading up to @entity145 , when the former @entity2 coach @entity146 called @entity147 , then 18 , into his squad to acclimatise him to a long and distinguished international career			1
@entity30 is already an established under - 19 international , but his progress is so dramatic , so rapid , that he should leapfrog @entity153 ’s under - 21 team			2
we are witnessing the future of @entity157 football , someone to get excited about after the pain and despair of those three depressing group games in @entity162			0
@entity30 already has given us reason to hope			0
if you are good enough , you are old enough and all that			0

the 19 - year - old *deserves* a call - up by @entity2 manager @entity0
