@entity0 loves a ' rabona ' goal			2
in fact , the @entity3 midfielder has been doing it for years			2
long before the 22 - year - old moved to @entity7 for a club - record £ 30million , @entity0 was using his go - to trick in @entity9 for the youth team of @entity11			1
if it works , you 're a @entity14			0
if it does n't , you 're a fool			0
but @entity0 appears to have the art of the ' rabona ' down after his audacious outside - of - the - box strike against @entity19 on thursday			1
his ' rabona ' against @entity19 , however , will take some beating as it glided into the far corner beyond goalkeeper @entity48 from more than 18 yards out			0
the man nicknamed ' @entity0 ' may not have total confidence in his right foot but , when capable of that with the left , little can be done to criticise the @entity55 international			0
@entity0 wraps his left foot around his right to score an outrageous ' rabona ' goal on thursday night @entity0 's incredible strike doubled @entity3 's lead against the visitors as they went on to win 5 - 1 it prompted @entity3 manager @entity63 to say afterwards : ' was it the best goal scored by one of my teams in my career ? probably , yes			1
' he practises it every day in training			0
it ’s a goal only a player with his skill can score			0
' @entity0 's incredible strike on thursday night was part of his brace and a 5 - 1 win in the @entity80 for @entity63 's side with @entity82 adding a hat - trick			1
@entity85 's @entity84 and @entity87 's @entity86 have tried it ... but how do they compare to @entity0 's ' rabona ' for @entity3 and @entity11 ?			1

@entity0 scored an incredible ' rabona ' goal for @entity3 on thursday
@entity3 midfielder did it for @entity11 's youth team earlier in his career
the record - breaking £ 30million *signing* scored two in 5 - 1 win over @entity19
@entity3 boss @entity63 : ' he practises it every day in training '
was @entity0 's @entity3 or @entity11 ' rabona ' goal better ? you *decide* ...
