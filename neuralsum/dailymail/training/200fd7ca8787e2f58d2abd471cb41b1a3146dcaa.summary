rarely have you seen a sadder sporting sight			2
as the buggy pulled into the car park here yesterday it revealed the greatest golfer of his generation and the greatest golfing athlete of all time with a face creased with pain			2
when @entity16 tried to stand up , the sense of shock among the few eyewitnesses was palpable			1
it was like watching an 80 - year - old man crippled by arthritis			1
for one awful moment , it looked like he would n’t be able to make it			2
eventually he did so but the effort was such he had to put both hands on the roof of his courtesy vehicle , a grey @entity27 , for a minute or so to recover			2
it was as much as he could do to raise his right leg the inches it took to enable him to kick off his shoe , and he clutched his lower back			1
the man who did more than any other to make the game an athletic pursuit had come to this			0
my mind wandered back to an interview earlier in the year with @entity63 @entity62 , who had an operation for a herniated disc similar to the one that @entity16 had in march			1
he thought he was fine too , only for his back to go as he tried to play a shot from thick rough			1
it was a year before he felt right — and he was 28 at the time , not 38			0
seeing woods in such distress , the idea that he could be part of the field for the @entity75 this week was untenable , while @entity80 @entity79 captain @entity78 can forget about him			1
you ca n’t take a man whose back might go at any minute			1
what a week @entity78 has had			0
he ’s probably only just come to terms with the @entity87 saga and now he ’s got this on his plate			0
pain game : @entity16 clutches his knee after his tee - shot on the ninth hole down and out : @entity16 hangs his head after pulling out through injury discomfort : @entity16 was immediately escorted off the course in a buggy blow : @entity16 's season may be over after his latest injury still , all his thoughts will be with the stricken @entity76 , as he contemplates what will surely prove another lengthy time away from the game			1
where it all went wrong was on the second hole			1
ironically , @entity16 had begun with a birdie but yet another stray drive left him in an awkward spot with his ball perched on top of a bunker			1
even at the time , it seemed a reckless play to try to propel the ball a good distance forward , for by necessity it meant he would tumble back into the bunker			1
but he took it on , and duly retreated into the sand at a jarring angle			0
during his prime athletic years , of course , there would have been no repercussions			0
but @entity16 felt a sickening pain that began just above his right buttock that would n’t go away			1
‘ i do n’t know what happened , i just jarred it and it has been in spasm ever since , ’ he said			0
at the par - three fifth he hit a tee shot so badly it finished 68 yards short of the flag			1
at the sixth , he was so wayward his ball finished in a hot dog stand			0
at the par - four ninth , he had one more swing with his driver and then he was done			1
he collapsed onto his haunches and the world knew what would happen next			0
will we see him again this year ? it seems highly unlikely			0
golf will go on very nicely without him , for a new generation led by @entity149 is leaving its mark			0
but it ’s hard not to have enormous sympathy for the man who made us all dream at one point that he could achieve the unthinkable and chase down @entity158 ’s total of 18 majors			0
the golfing world will gather at @entity161 this week , the place where @entity16 won a playoff for the @entity75 in 2000			1
it was his third major win in a row on his way to 14 , and he looked omnipotent			0
at 38 and no age for a golfer , the story should all have been about his return to past glories and his hopes of pulling off another triumph			1
instead he ’s where he was before back surgery in march , a scary world of uncertainty where the professionals are of the medical variety rather than his peers			1
you wish him the best but fear the worst			0
dec 2002 : has surgery on his left knee to remove fluid inside and outside the anterior cruciate ligament and remove benign cysts			2
aug 2007 : ruptures the acl in his left knee while running on a golf course after the @entity189			0
jun 2008 : has surgery to repair the acl in his left knee by using a tendon from his right thigh			2
does not return until the @entity193 at the end of february 2009			0
nov 2009 : hospitalised with a sore neck and a cut lip that required five stitches when the suv he was driving ran over a fire hydrant and into a tree			0
april 2011 : injures his left @entity202 hitting from an awkward stance below @entity205 on the 17th at @entity207			0
may 2011 : diagnosed with a sprain in his left knee and in his left @entity202			0
misses the next two months , including two majors			2
june 2013 : misses two tournaments due to a strain in his left elbow			0
aug 2013 : two weeks after the @entity225 , he only chips and putts on the back nine of the pro-am at @entity219 , dropping to his knees after one shot because of back spasms			1
mar 2014 : has back surgery in @entity227 for a pinched nerve			1
announces he will miss the masters for the first time in his career and not return to golf until late summer			2
