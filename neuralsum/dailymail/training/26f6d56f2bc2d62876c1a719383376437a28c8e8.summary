@entity0 , the president of the @entity1 , said @entity3 leaders had agreed to ‘ re-evaluate ’ its agenda after voters ‘ sent a strong message ’ at the weekend the @entity3 sparked fury by demanding an extra £ 500million from @entity10 taxpayers – just hours after claiming it would take heed of damning election results			1
the @entity13 was accused of ‘ living on a different planet ’ after asking member countries for a £ 3.8billion cash increase to its budget			1
around an eighth of this will come from @entity10 pockets , with the cash going on projects to help drive down @entity24 's chronic youth unemployment - as well as £ 200million for crisis - hit @entity25 including £ 60million from @entity10 taxpayers			1
the astonishing demand came just hours after @entity0 , the president of the @entity1 , said @entity3 leaders had agreed to ‘ re-evaluate ’ its agenda after voters ‘ sent a strong message ’ at the weekend			1
he announced a round of consultations with the leaders of the 28 @entity3 members on future policies such as reducing the amount of regulation			0
the apparent climb down came a day after @entity37 demanded change – saying the @entity3 had become ‘ too big , too bossy and too interfering ’			0
he travelled to @entity39 on tuesday to demand the union be dramatically scaled back , and to warn fellow leaders not to ‘ shrug off ’ the view of the @entity24 people that @entity39 should hand back power to national governments			2
at a dinner in the @entity48 capital that night , he won the first skirmish in his battle to prevent arch - federalist @entity51 taking the @entity13 ’s top job when it falls vacant in the autumn			2
@entity10 's net contribution to the @entity3 more than doubled between 2007 and last year - when taxpayers handed over more than £ 9billion to @entity39 but , despite the apparent successes , the @entity13 returned to form just hours later – by demanding its £ 110billion budget go up by £ 3.8billion to pay for youth employment projects and regional policy and extra help for @entity25			1
@entity10 is one of the largest contributors to the union , meaning that around £ 500million would come from the @entity10			0
the request comes just days after @entity24 election results in which millions voted for parties opposed to ever closer union or the entire concept of the @entity3			0
@entity70 came top of the poll in @entity10 , while there were successes for such parties in @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			0
@entity81 was all smiles during a meeting of leaders of @entity86 's political groups in @entity39 yesterday the claim for more cash from @entity10 comes after @entity37 told officials @entity39 had become too big and too bossy one @entity24 diplomat expressed incredulity at the @entity13 ’s cash demands , saying : ‘ what a smart way to react to the concerns of @entity24 ’s voters : let ’s ask them for more money			1
‘ the @entity13 must live on another planet if they think that @entity24 can reconnect with people by raiding their wallets , ' the diplomat told the @entity104			1
a spokesman for the @entity10 government said : ‘ at a time when countries across @entity24 continue to take difficult decisions to deal with deficits , the @entity13 should not be asking @entity24 's taxpayers for yet more money			2
’ the amount that @entity10 pours into the @entity3 has more than tripled over the last decade , up from £ 2.9billion in 2002 to £ 9.5billion in 2012			0
@entity24 leaders – urged on by @entity10 – reacted to this by cutting @entity3 spending between 2014 and 2020			0
but the small print means national governments can push spending up during the course of the year by claiming there is not enough money in the coffers to pay for previously agreed projects			0
a spokesman for the @entity13 said : ‘ member states agreed to frontload youth employment and science from 2015 to 2014 , which means more resources are needed			1
‘ member states agreed to help @entity25 , which means more resources are needed			2
member states sent far bigger bills for their cohesion ( regional ) policy projects than they told us they would , which means more resources needed			0

@entity13 accused of ' living on another planet ' with demand
comes after @entity0 said voters ' sent a strong message '
extra cash would help @entity25 and fund youth unemployment projects
