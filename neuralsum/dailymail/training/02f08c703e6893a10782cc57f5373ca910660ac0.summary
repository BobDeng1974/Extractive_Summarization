but three low - emission taxis introduced in @entity8 for the @entity9 had to be transported on a 130 - mile round trip to @entity11 to refuel			2
the black cabs run on hydrogen , but a fuelling station at @entity15 near the @entity16 has been closed for security reasons			1
long journey : low emission taxis like the one above were taken on a 130 - mile round trip from @entity8 to @entity11 to be refuelled a new fuelling station opened near @entity22 today , according to the consortium behind the scheme , the @entity25 for @entity27 project ( @entity28 )			1
until then , however , the taxis had to be loaded on to a transporter to be taken to the nearest station - at car manufacturer @entity33 's @entity11 plant			2
@entity28 co-ordinator @entity34 said : ' the fuelling at @entity11 was a one - off			2
' the new fuelling station at @entity22 is now operational and the taxis have today been fuelled and driven into central @entity8 to pick up the @entity38 , as part of a three - year project to develop hydrogen technology			1
' the government - run @entity42 said the scheme was aimed at demonstrating that hydrogen - fuelled low - emission vehicles could be used more widely in future			1
@entity47 , the lead technologist looking at transport and energy for the board , said the fuelling difficulties were ' short term '			0
' the benefits for those taxis - apart from showing off some great @entity55 technology to the rest of the world - is actually that they produce water out of their tail pipes , ' he added			0
out of the way : the taxis were refuelled at the nearest available station , based at car manufacturer @entity33 's @entity11 plant ( pictured ) ' so the particulates and air quality - it 's a big difference for @entity8 even if there 's a small carbon problem with having to ship them up to @entity11 to pick up hydrogen at the moment			1
' at the taxi scheme 's launch last month , @entity8 's deputy mayor @entity72 said : ' @entity8 â€™s hydrogen economy is bounding ahead			0
' the @entity28 project has been a terrific success , and it provides great lessons for others to get ahead in the most exciting new industry of the 21st century			0
' the station at the @entity83 plant in @entity11 is operated by industrial gases group @entity84 .			0
