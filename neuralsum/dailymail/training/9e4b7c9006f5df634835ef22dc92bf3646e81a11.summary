by @entity1 reporter published : 10:11 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 10:45 est , 11 september 2013 for $ 349 , your dog can learn to fly			2
security checks and bumpy air are all in a day 's training at a @entity8 film studio to prepare your dog for a safe and calm flight			1
the @entity8 class is billed as the first in a real fuselage on a sound stage with a simulator that mimics takeoff , turbulence and landing			1
@entity8 extras create crowds and chaos that come with terminals , luggage carts and the blare announcing arrivals , delays and departures			0
dogs on a plane : @entity29 , @entity30 , sitting left , front row , with dog @entity32 , far right , and other puppies from the @entity35 who are learning to fly the idea was the brainchild of @entity39 , president and ceo of @entity8 , the world 's largest aviation - themed film studio , who noticed a dog owner having a rough go getting a pooch through airport security			1
' the owner was stressed out and the dog was freaking out , ' @entity39 said			0
' i figured , ' why do n't i train those people ? ' he hired his friend and former actress , @entity29 , to write a program and teach the class with three other instructors and her dog @entity32			0
an animal trainer and lifestyle coach , @entity60 also has a psychology degree from @entity64			0
with more dogs racking up air miles these days , it makes sense to take obedience school to a new level , said @entity71 , who directs volunteers , including airport therapy dogs , at @entity74			2
@entity8 studio : members and volunteers from @entity78 , @entity78 , take a @entity80 flight class , as they wait in line at a mock @entity83 screening at the @entity80 flight school there are no numbers on how many pets are taking to the skies , but they have become essential parts of a growing number of families and traveling with them for work and play is becoming more common , said @entity95 , a spokesman for the @entity96 and @entity97 in @entity98			1
it will vary by airline , but there 's always a fee for cabin pets â€“ those under 20 pounds that have to stay in carriers under the seat during a flight			1
workings dogs or trained service animals ( most airlines also allow psychiatric and emotional support animals , too ) fly free , but owners must give the airline documentation and advance notice			2
the animals sit at their owner 's feet during flights			2
the class does n't address cargo pets			0
the class is using the same studio where parts of bridesmaids , @entity123 and 500 other movies were made			1
television scenes from @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 have also been filmed there			1
last year , @entity132 conducted a test class with 60 puppies from @entity78			1
' some of the handlers were more nervous than the dogs because they do n't like to fly , ' said @entity137 , who oversees puppy - training in @entity139			1
' it was amazing how realistic it was			0
' learning to fly : the classes take place in @entity8 , the world 's largest aviation - themed film studio two things are deliberately absent in the simulated airport : the smell of jet fuel and a change in cabin pressure that makes your ears pop. @entity39 opened his studio about six months before sept. 11			1
on sept. 12 , the phone started ringing because airports were locked down and movie and television studios could n't shoot scenes they needed			2
the studio has grown to include everything from a private jet to a 747 , as well as props and supplies			2
a guide dog takes longer and costs more than any other dog to train because they must be the eyes of their companion			0
so it was n't surprising ' that they all went through with flying colors , ' @entity60 said			0
going through security , none of the dogs balked or barked at the security wands or pat - downs , even if the wands set off alarms because of their leashes			2
famous studio : the 2011 movie bridesmaids used the same @entity185 studio to film airport its scenes ( actors from film pictured ) the dogs sat at their handlers ' feet in the cabin during the simulated flight , which came with engine sounds , the captain speaking , cabin lights being dimmed , overhead bins being shut and warm - up vibrations , @entity137 said			1
if there was any nervousness , it was during the simulated takeoff , landing or turbulence			1
when a dog gets nervous , it might clamp its jaw , lick its lips or get wide - eyed , @entity60 said			0
with the dogs in the test class , petting was enough to reassure them , she said			0
the staff was very knowledgeable about dog behavior and gave good advice , @entity137 said			0
' if a dog gets nervous , do n't coddle them			0
' that 's the same thing we use to raise confident , well - balanced dogs , ' @entity137 said			1
the studio is taking reservations for its first paid daylong class on oct. 19			0
classes will be held every month or two and will be open to well - behaved dogs of any @entity228 and @entity60 's collaboration is n't the first time they 've worked together on a sound stage			1
