@entity0 , 34 , says she no longer takes daughter @entity1 to @entity3 centre , @entity4 , after she was told to take her buggy outside council bosses have come under fire after barring parents from bringing their prams into a mother and baby centre for ' health and safety reasons ' , telling them to use an outside buggy park instead			1
the angry parents say staff at the @entity3 centre in @entity4 are forcing them to leave expensive prams chained up in freezing weather , and fear they could become a target for thieves			1
it is thought the buggy park has been in place for around three weeks , despite previous government advice saying there is no need for a ' blanket ban ' on prams inside children 's centres			1
mother @entity0 , 34 , says the ban means she no longer fells comfortable taking her four - month - old daughter @entity1 to the centre			2
she said : ' it 's health and safety gone mad			0
my baby has underdeveloped eyesight and doctors told me to use the sensory room there but i ca n't now as i ca n't take her pram in			2
' there is no way i 'm going to leave the pram chained up outside , i could n't afford to replace it if it was stolen and i do n't want to put my baby into a freezing cold buggy when we come back out			1
' if word gets out that we are leaving our prams outside then we could be targeted			1
' the staff have been abrupt and say it 's health and safety but that never stopped us before - i 've been going there for three months , the prams were n't causing problems or blocking corridors			2
' i was there one friday with no problem at all and by the same monday we were turned away at the door			0
there was no warning given at all			0
' after refusing to leave her pram unattended , @entity64 , 28 , claims she was told to take her baby to another centre to be weighed			1
she said : ' i went to the centre twice a week until they told me to leave my pram outside			2
' i 'm not putting my baby into a freezing cold pram - it needs sorting , i ca n't get my baby weighed			1
' they say it 's health and safety but that 's rubbish , it 's supposed to be a centre for babies and children and they could get sick as a result of this nonsense			0
' @entity83 said the ban on taking prams inside the centre ( pictured ) was made after staff carried out a risk assessment and found they were blocking walkways and fire exits @entity92 , who is mum to four - month - old @entity93 , added : ' it was about three weeks ago when i first encountered the ban			2
i could n't believe what i was hearing i thought it was a joke			0
' @entity93 has not been very well since birth so when i was asked to leave his pram outside in the sleet and rain i was really upset			0
' i needed to take him in to be weighed so i agreed but when i came back out and put him in the buggy he was freezing and developed a cold as a result			1
' i understand that the ban wo n't be such a big deal in summer and i went back last week and explained that i could n't leave my buggy inside again			1
' they let me bring the pram inside that day because it was a quiet time but it 's not really good enough			0
' a spokesman for @entity113 said that the ban was put in place after staff carried out a risk assessment and found the prams were blocking walkways and fire exits			2
she added that the centre has recently become busier as a result of new courses being put on , and was struggling to fit the extra pushchairs inside			0
the government 's @entity125 responded to similar cases by saying : ' there is no health and safety reason for a blanket ban on buggies and prams in a children 's centre			1
ms @entity0 , who takes her daughter to use the sensory room at the centre after she was born with underdeveloped eyesight , says she fears the pram park could become a target for thieves ' seeking a solution that works for everyone would be infinitely preferable to hiding behind quoting " health and safety " as a blanket excuse			2
' @entity4 's mp @entity146 said : ' only a crazy person would insist parents wake their sleeping children before they 're ready			1
' i 'm sure there were sound practical reasons for suggesting the rule but we need to make sure nothing puts parents off accessing services			0
' @entity157 , a councillor responsbile for children , families and learning , added : ' we have n't banned people from bringing prams and buggies into the centre but it is a question of safety for everyone who uses it			0
' we 've asked people to use their judgement , particularly at busy times , and park their prams and buggies in the covered , on - site buggy park			1
' we will provide locks and help people get in and out of the centre if they need help			0
' councillor @entity179 added : ' our priority is on speaking with these families to find workable solutions to the problems they have raised			0
' we know the success of our @entity186 depends on our ability to make it as user friendly as possible			0
