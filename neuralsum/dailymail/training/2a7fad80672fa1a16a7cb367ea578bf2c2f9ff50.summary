crumbling , barricaded and strewn with rubbish , these sporting venues cut a sorry sight just two years on from the @entity3 in @entity4			1
once the focus of the world 's attention , the sites now lie desolate - a stark reminder that hopes of a lasting legacy from international events can lie in tatters			1
the @entity14 , which lit up the @entity15 with spectacular opening and closing ceremonies , has since been left decaying with overgrown plants , skeleton guard booths , growing wasteland , peeling paint and broken furniture			2
eyesore : @entity4 's @entity14 , which lit up the @entity24 with spectacular opening and closing ceremonies , is now surrounded by rubbish uninviting : these gates and the unkempt land behind them do n't give the appearance of a stadium well used wasted opportunity ? the stadium usually seats 60,000 and is the third - largest multipurpose stadium in @entity34 no - go area : the entrance to the @entity3 village is now blocked by barriers and adorned with broken signs from the 2010 event rubbish ! the @entity41 , which was renovated especially for the @entity3 at a cost of over £ 20million , looks more like a tip painful viewing : the @entity41 can seat 25,000 and is named after former prime minister of india @entity45 littered : an area outside the @entity48 , which hosted the hockey at the @entity3 the stadium usually seats 60,000 people and is the third - largest multipurpose stadium in @entity34			1
but given the deluge of fiascos that hit the @entity3 at the time , it perhaps is n't so surprising that it has n't stood the test of time			2
embarrassing pictures leaked to the media in the run - up to the event showed filth and squalor at the athletes ' village			1
a snake was later found in a @entity70 competitor 's room			0
stray dogs and monkeys became a menace and many top athletes pulled out over concerns about their safety			0
many were also left alarmed when a key pedestrian bridge close to the main stadium collapsed , while a giant scoreboard at the rugby sevens stadium also fell down			0
better days : fireworks go off in a spectacular display at the end of the opening ceremony of the @entity24 inside the @entity14 pastures new : an @entity34 gardener waters a flowerbead near the @entity14 ahead of the 2010 games another photograph of the venues today shows the main road into the @entity94 broken and unattractive			0
meanwhile , the @entity41 was renovated especially for the @entity3 in 2010 at a cost of over £ 20 million , but now it lays dirty , unkempt and crumbling			0
the images may fuel fears for the future use of @entity101 's @entity100 in @entity102 after the @entity103			1
the subsequent use of the @entity105 has been dogged with controversy and legal wrangles amid battles for ownership after the @entity3			0
same fate ? critics of the @entity112 fear the money pumped into the @entity100 in @entity102 ( above ) will not provide the legacy organisers have promised a lot at stake : in 2005 , the predicted cost of @entity112 was £ 2.37billion , but it 's currently set to come in over budget at £ 12billion or even £ 24billion last year , it emerged taxpayers face a bill running into tens of millions of pounds after a proposed deal to sell the venue to @entity124 collapsed			1
critics are yet to be convinced that the money injected into the area will go on to provide a legacy for @entity101 as promised			1
the predicted cost of the games when @entity101 won the bid in 2005 was £ 2.37billion , but it ’s currently predicted to come in over budget at £ 12billion or even £ 24billion			0
earlier this week , @entity134 president @entity133 expressed his belief that the @entity112 would leave a lasting impression			1
' i am confident these @entity3 will capture the spirit of this great cosmopolitan city , ' he said			0
' i am confident these @entity3 will leave a lasting positive legacy for @entity101			2
' when the @entity141 of @entity34 was contacted for a comment on the state of the @entity4 venues , no - one would take responsibility for the upkeep of these stadiums .			2

stadiums deserted two years after taking centre stage at international event
will fuel fears that promised legacy from @entity112 may also fail to deliver
