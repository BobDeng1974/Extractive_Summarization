big seller : @entity1 has had nine million pre-orders for the @entity3 - but you may be waiting for the blue model in the history of gadgets , none has picked up such an army of fans before launch			1
the @entity3 has already received nine million pre-orders before launch - even with few people getting to play on @entity16 's latest smartphone until it arrives in the @entity18 on may 29			1
when the phone arrives , it will instantly become the fastest selling gadget in history , beating out the @entity24 's four million units sold in three days			1
it also tops the first @entity27 's two million tablets in two months , and the @entity29 system - which allows you to wave at your television via the @entity33 games console - which shifted 2.5 million units in 25 days			0
@entity1 has reportedly hired 75,000 workers to keep up with the demand , with the company confident of meeting all pre-orders			0
the company is said to have the capacity to churn out five million phones per month - or 66 phones per worker per month			0
most of the orders will have come through network carriers across the world , based on customer pre-orders , upgrades and anticipated demand			0
the carriers will have pre-allocated the majority of this stock to customers , with a surplus to act as a ' buffer ' in case demand exceeds their supply			0
in the @entity18 , @entity59 has confirmed that the @entity3 is the most popular phone of the year so far , with thousands of customers lined up to pick up their phone a week from today			1
spokesman @entity63 said : ' pre-order demand for the new @entity3 has surpassed expectations since the handset was first unveiled two weeks ago			2
' the first 24 hours alone saw thousands placing their pre-order at @entity59			0
' the @entity3 's predecessor - the @entity70 - took about six months to sell 10million phones , and 11 months to sell 20million			2
the release of the phone is likely to swell the number of @entity16 users - although with the plethora of devices on the operating system , the increase may end up just causing a small spike			1
there are now in the region of 350million @entity16 users in the world - with an estimated 900,000 to one million people picking up a new @entity16 device each day			1
the software could be on one billion screens by the end of 2013 , according to some estimates			1
@entity91 have not released recent figures for @entity93 - both iphones and @entity27 - but in early 2011 the total was believed to be about 110million			2
@entity96 is notoriously quiet on the number of sales of @entity99 , but it is believed to have shipped about 10 million phones since the operating system launched two years ago , giving them just a fraction - 1.3 per cent - of the market			1
although , to be fair to @entity96 , they might not even need a phone version of @entity105 - due to patent and licensing agreements , @entity96 makes between $ 5 and $ 15 on most sales of @entity16 phones , compared to the estimated $ 3 which goes into @entity111 's pockets per handset through advertising revenue each year			2
competition : the @entity24 is @entity91 's current model , while @entity115 is trying hard with the @entity117 phone however @entity115 is relying on @entity99 , having invested heavily in the operating system as it begins to phase out the ' @entity119 ' os which has powered much of the manufacturer 's range of phones			1
@entity91 and @entity1 between them account for 49.3 per cent of all smartphone sales worldwide - an increase on the 29 per cent the two had in early 2011			2
the @entity3 is @entity1 's latest flagship phone			2
despite the record pre-orders it will face substantial competition from @entity131 's one series of phones , and the always strong - selling @entity24 range			0
the @entity1 's most innovative feature is built - in face - tracking and voice control - allowing , @entity1 claims , for a more ' natural ' control system			0
it will also pay tribute to @entity1 's expertise in screens , with a large 4.8 - inch @entity141 screen running a resolution of 1280 x 720p - far bigger than @entity91 ’s @entity24 , and close in size to the smaller end of the tablet market			1
other innovations include what @entity1 claims is a ' more intelligent ' lock system , that keeps the screen ' awake ' when the phone ’s camera senses eyes watching it , rather than turning it off			0
the next @entity24 is not due before the @entity152 , traditionally launching around october			0
it is rumoured to come with a four - inch screen , and may be joined by a new addition to the @entity155 - an @entity156 .			0

@entity3 will be fastest selling gadget in history
*analysts* predict @entity16 usage will swell from an estimated 350million users today to one billion by end of 2013
@entity99 continues to sit at bottom of smartphone market as users stick with @entity91 and @entity16
