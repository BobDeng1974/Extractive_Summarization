@entity1 's sparring championship protagonists @entity2 and @entity3 again proved there is little to separate them			1
in - form @entity2 emerged top dog from @entity3 at the end of friday 's two practice sessions for the @entity9 @entity8 by a hair 's breadth , just three thousandths of a second			1
championship leader @entity2 maintained his focus despite a hydraulic problem on friday @entity2 had topped @entity16 at the @entity17 by a clear 0.293secs from @entity3 , with @entity20 's @entity19 their closest challenger			1
but in switching from the medium - compound tyres used in @entity23 to the soft @entity25 rubber given an outing in @entity27 , @entity3 managed to reel in his @entity29 team - mate			1
@entity2 's day also ended under a slight cloud as his car encountered a hydraulic problem with 20 minutes remaining , bringing an early end to his day 's running			2
it underlined the fact that despite winning the last four grands prix to open up a 17 - point cushion to @entity3 , @entity2 's hopes of claiming a second title rest as much on the reliability of his car over the final three races as his own talent			1
@entity45 's @entity44 prepares for practice session at the @entity17 , in @entity47 , @entity48 @entity50 's seventeen - year - old test driver @entity49 from speaks to his team in the pits with @entity2 on a roll , the @entity53 holds a 17 - point cushion going into one of his favourite races of the year in the @entity9 on sunday			1
with nine victories already this season - only @entity58 and @entity44 have won more in a single campaign - @entity60 is confident of keeping the momentum going			2
' i do n't see why not , ' said @entity2			2
' @entity3 's obviously going to be strong this weekend , and he 's going to be pushing , but the tables could always turn			2
' @entity3 has shown that this year , every race he bounces back , but i 've been strong here in the past , and i 'm hoping to be very strong here this weekend			0
' the last few races i 've really felt great , amazing			0
it was almost like there was a wall in front of me and i was trying to climb it but i could n't quite get over it			0
' but i 've got over it now and hopefully the remaining races are more like hurdles rather than big tall walls			0
' @entity2 poses in front of a fans ' banner in the pit lane in @entity47 on friday @entity2 and @entity3 were head and shoulders above any of their rivals , with @entity86 's @entity85 the best of the rest , and not for the first time this season			1
@entity85 finished a staggering 1.104secs adrift of @entity2 , such is the performance advantage of the @entity29 at this track			0
@entity45 's @entity93 , who only completed five laps in @entity16 due to his car encountering an @entity97 ( energy recovery system ) problem , was back on track in @entity27			2
@entity93 rattled off 29 laps to finish fourth quickest , whilst in contrast team - mate @entity44 propped up the timesheet			1
it was confirmed in between the two sessions the team had installed a complete power unit , and with it being the sixth of the season , the outgoing four - times champion serves a penalty that will see him start from the pit lane			2
however , @entity44 almost immediately encountered problems with the new system as he managed only 19 laps , finishing nearly five seconds off the pace			0

with both teams and out of this event , it means the field for this weekend 's race will be the lowest since the 2005 @entity131			0
behind the leading quartet was @entity134 ' @entity133 , followed by @entity135 in his @entity86 and @entity50 's @entity136			0

significantly , in the dying stages of the second session the @entity146 tested their new virtual safety car ( @entity151 ) system			0
the device has been introduced in the wake of @entity155 's life - threatening crash in the @entity156 @entity8 nearly four weeks ago			0
@entity155 went off the @entity157 under double - waved yellow - flag conditions , forcing the @entity146 to experiment with the @entity151 - which forces a driver to slow significantly via a signal sent to the cockpit of his car .			0
