by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter a flying saucer flew high over the @entity4 off @entity5 on saturday as @entity6 tested a new vehicle that could one day be used to transport people to @entity9			1
the test drive of the @entity11 , which was carried 120,000ft ( 23 miles ) into the sky by a helium balloon , was considered a success despite the parachute not fully working			1
cheers in the control room as the vehicle launched from the island of @entity20 quickly died down however , when it became clear that the new inflatable braking system had failed to property unfurl			0
the low - density supersonic decelerator could one day be used to take astronauts to @entity9 flying saucer : the spaceship - shaped test vehicle is lifted by a helium balloon in @entity5 @entity6 officials were still pleased with the flight for the $ 150 million experiment , and said it was a pretty good test of technology that might one day be used to deliver heavy spacecraft - and eventually astronauts - to @entity9			1
the space agency also hopes that the new craft could one day replace the same parachute design in use since the twin @entity41 spacecraft landed on the red planet in 1976			0
saturday 's launch over @entity5 was the first successful attempt after previous flights were marred by strong winds that could have blown the craft into no - fly zones			1
technology needs to advance , or else humanity wo n't be able to fly beyond the @entity50 in low - @entity52 orbit , according to @entity53 , head of space technology , at @entity6 headquarters			0
' technology development ' is the surest path to @entity9 , ' @entity53 said at a june briefing			0
the device is hoisted on to a launch tower which is used to attach it to the balloon to infinity and beyond : the $ 150 million flying saucer shaped vehicle is put through its paces the test vehicle is seen drifting into the distance on saturday viewers around the world followed portions of the mission in real time over the internet thanks to cameras on board the vehicle that beamed back low - resolution footage as it ascended over the @entity81 island of @entity20			2
after taking off at 11.40am from the @entity83 , the balloon boosted the disc - shaped vehicle over the @entity4			0
its rocket motor ignited , carrying the vehicle at supersonic speeds to an altitude of 34 miles above the surface			2
the environment this high up is similar to the thin @entity9 atmosphere , where @entity6 still uses 1970s technology to bring rovers and other devices onto the @entity9 surface			1
a graphic shows the proposed flight path and touch down for the flying saucer ' we want to test them here where it 's cheaper before we send it to @entity9 to make sure that it 's going to work there , ' project manager @entity102 of the @entity103 said during a pre-launch news conference in @entity20 in early june			2
when it prepared to drop back the @entity52 , a tube around the vehicle was supposed to have expanded like a @entity81 puffer fish , creating atmospheric drag to dramatically slow it down from @entity117 , or four times the speed of sound			0
in flight : the saucer - shaped vehicle hovering saturday over @entity20 , @entity5 , during an experimental flight high in @entity52 's atmosphere saturday 's test : this image shows the launch of the high - altitude balloon carrying a saucer - shaped vehicle for @entity6 the parachute , which on this occasion failed to fully unfurl , is used to guide the vehicle to a safe ocean splashdown			1
at 110ft in diameter , the parachute is twice as big as the one that carried the 1 - ton curiosity rover through the @entity9 atmosphere in 2011			2
engineers planned to analyze the data and conduct several more flights next year before deciding whether to fly the vehicle and parachute on a future @entity9 mission .			0

the saturday launch over @entity5 took the spacecraft 23 miles above the surface and into the @entity52 's atmosphere
conditions at that altitude are similar to those on @entity9
the saucer could one day transport humans and heavier *payloads* to the ' @entity9 '
