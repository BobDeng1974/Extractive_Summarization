by @entity0 he 's the master of molecular gastronomy — famed for exotic combinations such as snail porridge and bacon - and - egg ice cream			0
so what happened when @entity7 decided to cope with the age - old problem of baked beans exploding in a microwave oven ? describing it as ‘ his least favourite problem of all microwave cooking ’ , @entity7 ’s solution was to come up with his own £ 279.95 ‘ intelligent ’ microwave			1
his oven is like other microwaves in that the food heats up from the inside while the oven stays cool			1
but @entity7 points out : ‘ foods differ enormously in their water content			1
vegetables , for example , are made up of between 85 and 95 per cent water			0
meats are about 70 per cent , butter is less than 20 , while most cooking chocolate is only 3 per cent water			1
’ @entity7 ’s microwave — which has just seven buttons and an lcd panel — uses sensors to detect the moisture in each dish , then monitors humidity as it cooks , testing temperature constantly and altering the cycle and heat according to how each dish is reacting			1
so does it live up to the hype ? @entity55 puts it through its paces			0
@entity7 claims the microwaves sensors scan the food and alter cooking times accordingly , delivering perfection every time cooking time : three minutes for 120g , at a low temperature			1
i tell the microwave i ’m cooking baked beans , and it sets a low temperature and chooses the cooking time			1
all i do is press start			0
@entity71 : i can cook dishes for exquisite dinner parties in my @entity74 — but i ’ve always failed to properly heat baked beans in a microwave			1
they either dry out or explode			0
apparently , this is because they ’re a tricky combination of high - water - content sauce and lower - water - content bean.i open the door and find a bowl of heated beans that are perfectly , evenly cooked			0
no coagulation , no split beans and best of all , no exploding baked bean sauce all over the microwave			1
score : 5/5 the cooking process required by @entity7 's microwave is a bit too much of a faff , explains @entity0 cooking time : four minutes for 50g , at a high then low temperature			1
ease : for one portion i weigh the oats , measure 250ml of water ( one - part - oats to five - parts - water ) and place in a microwave - safe dish with a kitchen towel over it			1
i select ‘ cook oats ’ , and press start			0
it cooks for two minutes then , halfway through , it beeps and a message flashes telling me to ‘ stir / turn food ’			1
i stir away , then press start again and wait until it finishes , before leaving to stand for three minutes before serving			0
@entity71 : my results are ok , but i have n’t been exact enough with my measuring — the porridge is a little dry			0
it ’s my mistake , but the whole process is a bit of a faff when compared to my usual method of just adding boiling water to oats and stirring on a hob			0
score : 2/5 cooking time : six minutes , 40 seconds for 250g , at a medium temperature			2
ease : @entity7 advises me to cook chicken in a shallow , round , microwave - safe dish , with larger and thicker pieces around the outside			1
i select chicken , plug in the weight and press start			0
halfway through , the oven beeps and the ‘ stir / turn food ’ light comes on			2
i turn the chicken , put the microwave - safe plastic wrap back on it , and press start again			2
@entity71 : any attempt i ’ve ever made to cook meat in a microwave before has always ended badly			2
the cooking time of chicken in @entity7 ’s microwave is calculated to allow for the fact that meat continues to cook for up to five minutes after it comes out of the microwave			1
and , hey presto ! a dish full of moist and succulent chicken pieces — which could have come from my @entity74 — emerges from the microwave			2
score : 4/5 @entity7 's microwave delivered a jacket potato that @entity0 said was the best she ever had cooking time : four minutes , ten seconds for 250g , at high temperature			1
ease : pop the potato in the microwave and select ‘ cook ’ , ‘ potato ’ and the weight			2
even i ca n’t muck this up ! @entity71 : when the buzzer goes , i wrench the door open with @entity7 - style enthusiasm and find a soft - skinned potato inside			1
is this a fail from @entity7 ? i plunge in a fork expecting to be disappointed — and find perfect , fluffy white flesh			1
i ’ve never ever tasted a jacket potato so good			0
the flesh inside is so meltingly delicious i can overlook the fact the skin is n’t crunchy			0
score : 5/5 cooking time : 45 seconds for 100g , at a low temperature			2
ease : for me , softening butter in a microwave has always ended up with a lake of butter			2
i put the butter in whole , press the ‘ soften butter ’ button in the door on the shortcuts panel , turn the dial to select weight , and press start			0
@entity71 : perfectly soft , spreadable butter in less than a minute			0
i ’ve avoided a meltdown ! score : 5/5 the first microwave oven was launched in 1947 - it was the size of a fridge and weighed nearly 750lb cooking time : seven minutes , 30 seconds for 350g , at a medium temperature			1
ease : i arrange white fish fillets in a shallow dish , fold over the thin fish tails as per @entity7 ’s instructions ( to stop them becoming dry ) and cover with microwave - safe wrap			1
halfway through cooking , the oven tells me to turn the fish			2
it ’s a little fiddly , but i pop it back in the oven			0
once cooked , a message on the screen tells me to leave the fish to stand for five minutes , as it continues to cook outside the oven			0
@entity71 : cooking fish in a microwave usually ends with a curled - up fillet or an unappealing lump of disintegrated fish			1
this time , one fillet tail has flipped out , and cooked dry as a result			0
but on the main fillets , the flesh flakes off in delicious pieces			0
my first happy fishy ending since i saw @entity219			0
score : 4/5 cooking time : seven minutes , 30 seconds for 500g , at a medium - high temperature			2
ease : i put the mince into a microwave - safe container , cover with kitchen towel and select ‘ cook ’ and ‘ meat ’ , plugging in the weight			2
halfway through , the ‘ stir / turn food ’ button flashes and beeps , and i have to stir it to break up the lumps , before finishing cooking			1
@entity71 : usually , my microwave transforms expensive mince into grey goo			2
but no — this is broken up , moist and tasty			0
a first for me ! score : 5/5 cooking broccoli in the microwave is a winner - as long as you follow @entity7 's rules cooking time : three minutes for 250g , at high temperature			1
ease : i cut it into florets , add a tablespoon of water per 100g , cover with kitchen towel , select ‘ cook ’ , ‘ soft vegetable ’ , the weight and hit start			0
halfway through , the ‘ stir / turn food ’ alarm buzzes , and i give it a stir			0
easier than a saucepan boiling over			0
@entity71 : i ’ve broken @entity7 ’s cardinal rule — always chop veg into even slices			1
some are mushy , others too crunchy			0
sorry @entity7 , i ’ll try harder next time ! score : 3/5 to order : www.lakeland.co.uk or by phone 01539488100			1
