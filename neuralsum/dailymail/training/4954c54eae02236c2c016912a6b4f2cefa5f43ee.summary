perhaps the fish you are eating was related to those swimming above your head at @entity4 , @entity5			2
and it 's a good idea not to go over the top on the wine if you 're at the @entity14 restaurant restaurant - on - the - rocks outside @entity12 , @entity13			0
this selection of eateries is a real collection of the weird and wonderful - yet each to itself has the undeniable wow factor			1
can i have a fishy , on a little dishy ? @entity23 , which means mother - of - pearl in @entity25 , is the very first undersea restaurant in the world floating oasis : the @entity29 , @entity30 in @entity31 gives the look of the ideal postcard , and is certainly right out of the ordinary @entity23 , which means mother - of - pearl in @entity25 , the under - sea restaurant off the @entity5 is arguably the most impressive - as swarms of fish skim the roof over your head , concentration on what delicacy to select may well wander			1
the world 's first undersea restaurant is five metres below sea level at the @entity47 in @entity48 in the @entity5			1
the acrylic structure has a capacity of 14 people and a transparent roof with a 270 ° panoramic underwater view so you can stare at marine life all you want			0
@entity13 's @entity56 , located on a promontory 24 metres above sea level , offers diners the chance to hear the waves crashing against the rock that actually houses the restaurant			2
and the grand waterfall adjacent to the appropriately - named @entity64 in @entity65 , the @entity62 can help soothe the diner into a warm experience			0
these restaurants will offer fine food , as well as an atmosphere and memories you will never forget - just do n't forget your camera			0
impressive : the @entity75 , @entity74 will offer unrivalled views of the city @entity78 culture : the @entity14 restaurant is embedded into the cliffs of @entity82 , 30 kilometres from @entity83 in @entity13 misty in roots : @entity87 's central highlands are blessed with long - reaching views of paddies , trees and valleys , and @entity92 in @entity93 offers a split level dining experience with the majestic sights of the surrounding countryside high dining : stylish decor and city views combine with the @entity101 in @entity102 , the showpiece restaurant of the @entity104 , @entity102 , a hotel thirty - five stories up in the @entity107			1
a window seat is obviously best , but diners report that on a sunny day , when the dining room is saturated with light , any table is a joy that falling feeling : at the @entity64 in @entity65 , the @entity62 , lunch is served inches from the cascading water of an impressive set of falls eating barefoot : the @entity14 restaurant , in @entity121 in @entity122 , @entity123 , inside an ancient limestone cliff on the edge of @entity126			2
the cave , with a floor of fine - powdered sand , opens on the beach			0
shoes are optional , presumably underground haven : @entity133 's @entity78 , converted 30 years ago , is 30km south of @entity134 in @entity135 , and compromises a series of interlinking chambers at depths of up to 10m below ground level			0
the natural holes in the roof crust are open to the sky , and candles complete the romantic vibe of this rather magical grotto @entity147 supper : a simple wooden deck looks out onto one of the most stunning ocean views in @entity151			0
the @entity152 occupies an enviable position above @entity154 at the southwestern tip of @entity151 snow pretty : a beautiful mountain chalet in @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 has to be one of the best places to bask in the view of @entity162			0
situated on the summit of @entity165 and easily accessible even for pedestrians using a gondola and cable car , the restaurant is taking advance bookings right around now vertigo nights : in @entity175 , 12 km north of the city of @entity173 , @entity174 , you can experience fine - dining on the side of a cliff ... which is fine if you 're not afraid of heights			1
if you are , the 30 - metre - long narrow concrete bridge hanging on the side of a vertical cliff overlooking the @entity182 might just be your worse nightmare			1
luckily , there 's a metal railing you can grab on to while you crawl your way to the restaurant carved into the cliff - side red red skies : the @entity190 is located in @entity31 on the edge of the world famous @entity192 of the @entity190			1
surrounding the lodge , the @entity194 stretches from the @entity196 to the @entity197 inside out : @entity198 in @entity199 will give you a very ' @entity202 ' feeling panoramic views : the @entity205 restaurant in @entity206 , completes one turn every hour and a half ; so guests can admire both the @entity210 north face and @entity162 from their seat			2

the world 's most **spectacular** - and *bizarre* - restaurants *include* dining on the side of a cliff over the @entity182 or underwater in the @entity5
dine on the edge of the @entity190 , take in the views at a @entity206 restaurant which turns full circle every hour , or among paddy fields in @entity87
from crashing waves to **spectacular** *skylines* , they all have the wow factor
