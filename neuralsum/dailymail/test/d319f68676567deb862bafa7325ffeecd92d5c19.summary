incredible footage has emerged of a mysterious pair of white lights seen hovering perilously close to to the @entity4 volcano eruption			1
@entity5 , which has laid dormant for more than 40 years , suddenly erupted on wednesday causing a thick plume of ash to cloud the sky while thousands of people living in its shadow were forced to flee the ' apocalypse - like ' event			1
hundreds filmed the eruption , near the southern port city of @entity16 , @entity4 , and its deadly ash cloud which caused all nearby flights to be grounded for safety			1
but one amateur cameraman was surprised to see what appeared to be white lights close to the enormous plume of ash and smoke rising from the mouth of the volcano			1
tens of thousands of people have speculated on what the @entity51 could be , suggesting everything from police or emergence services helicopters , to a kind of optical illusion or even an alien craft			2
one @entity60 user , @entity59 , believed it was time travelers			0
he wrote : ' most ufos are not aliens like a lot of people think			0
they are in fact time machines from the future			0
the reason you see so many ufos at historic events is because people from the future want to come back in time and witness history			0
a lot of these ufos are filled with students and are just going on a futuristic version of a field trip			0

' while @entity95 : ' it 's a airplane , come on ! up in smoke : @entity5 , in southern @entity4 , has erupted forcing 1,500 residents from @entity98 , about 10 miles away , to flee their homes ( pictured , a view of the eruption from @entity16 , a small city around 20 miles from the volcano ) smoke and lava can be seen spewing from the @entity31 in this picture taken from the shores of @entity106 in @entity107 an electrical storm lights up the night sky as a huge column of ash and lava shoots out of the volcano			1
the eruption sparked a red alert in the port city of @entity16 @entity5 , believed to be among the three most dangerous of @entity4 's 90 active volcanoes , had erupted for the first time at 6pm local time on wednesday			1
an estimated 1,500 people were forced to flee the nearby town of @entity98 after the eruption , while several smaller townships were also cleared			1
experts said the main risk was now now of a pyroclastic flow - a superheated current of gas and rock that can destroy nearly everything in its path and travel at speeds upwards of 200 to 300 kilometers per hour			2
@entity133 , a vulcanologist with @entity4 ’s geological and mining service , said : “ in this situation , with the eruption column so high , the main risk is that it collapses , falls due to gravity because of its own weight and causes a pyroclastic flow , ”			1
locals described an apocalyptic scene as ash clouds were shot six miles into the air creating an incredible display of lightning and lava against the night 's sky			2
another unexpected eruption in the @entity150 yesterday heightened fears of local waters becoming contaminated , residents developing severe breathing problems and more flights being grounded			1
the ash covered cars and houses in cities as far as 18 miles away from the source of the eruption as another massive evacuation effort gets underway			1
previous and equally violent eruptions at @entity31 have continued for up to a week , according to a volcanologist from @entity165 who told @entity166 it is impossible to predict what will happen next			1
the volcano is located near the tourist town of @entity107 and the city of @entity16 , a little more than 620 miles south of @entity4 's capital , @entity173			1
the @entity174 issued a high alert , setting up an exclusion zone of 12.5miles around the volcano , barring access to the area			0
@entity180 , who lives in @entity98 , some six miles from the volcano , said the eruption happened without warning			2
@entity5 's last major eruption happened in 1961 , with a weak eruption following in 1972			2
he said : ' it sounded like a big tractor trailer passing by the road , rattling and shaking , guttural rumbling ... we left everything there , grabbed my kid , my dog , got in the car with my wife			0
mr @entity180 , who was originally born in @entity199 , said he was now driving his family to @entity107			0
he added : ' all the neighbors were outside , a lot of young people crying			0
' dusted : a car covered in ash at the @entity98 locality , on the outskirts of @entity31 volcano ghost town : most people have abandoned the @entity98 locality in @entity107 ( pictured ) which has been caked in ash despite being over 18 miles away from the massive eruption at @entity31 volcano boats dusted with volcanic ash deposited from the eruptions of the looming @entity31 volcano , background , sit parked in front of a home television pictures showed a spectacular mushroom - shaped column billowing into the sky with occasional lighting bolts shooting through it			1
the eruption was seen up to 100 miles away in neighbouring @entity229			2
@entity230 , a resident of @entity107 , said : ' there are a lot of people out in the streets , many heading to the gas stations to fill up on gas			0
a friend told me to fill everything we have with water			0
' @entity4 , on the @entity242 ' , has the second largest chain of volcanoes in the world after @entity246 , including around 500 that are potentially active			2
in march , volcano @entity248 , also in southern @entity4 , erupted in spectacular fashion , sending a plume of ash and lava high into the sky , but quickly subsided			1
volcanoes occur at the edges of tectonic plates which make up the earth 's crust , either where these plates are moving toward or away from one another			0
eruptions occur when magma from the @entity265 's core forces its way to the surface , exploding through weak points in the crust			0
unexpected : the volcano last erupted in 1972 , and while it is widely believed to be among @entity4 's most dangerous , it was not under observation before it erupted today ( the eruption pictured from @entity107 ) explosion : residents in nearby @entity107 go about their business while in the background the ash cloud from @entity5 is seen @entity279 : the scene looked calm away from the fall out from the ash , but southern @entity4 remains on alert			1

@entity31 in southern @entity4 - which has been dormant for 40 years - erupted without warning on wednesday
a second *terrifying* eruption yesterday has now forced over *4,000* to flee in *aftermath* of the ' apocalypse - like ' event
footage of the eruption has revealed a strange pair of white lights floating perilously close to the ash cloud
