by @entity0 for @entity1 a 15 - year - old girl was sent home on the first day of high school last week because her red hair was too ' distracting ' to other students			1
however , @entity8 sophomore @entity7 says she 's been dying her head bright red for the past three years and no one at the school has complained before			1
' i have never had anybody come up to me and say , " maybe you should n't have this color , " or , " do you think that 's a bad color , " ' @entity7 told @entity18			2
now , @entity7 and her parents are threatening to sue the school unless they excuse her absence and let her dye her hair back			1
she has since stripped the color ( right ) so as not to miss more class time turned around : @entity7 's mom @entity29 had to pick her up from @entity8 less than 30 minutes after dropping her off for the first day @entity7 's mother @entity29 said she got a call less than 30 minutes after dropping her daughter off on the first day of school - before @entity7 even made it to homeroom			1
administrators allegedly sent multiple students home that day for distracting hair colors , which is violates a student handbook rule against ' distracting ' or ' disruptive ' hair styles			1
@entity40 says she knows about the rule , but did n't think her daughter was in violation since she 's never been sent home for her red hair before			1
' i told the principal , i said , ' " you were her assistant principal last year			0
how come you never sent her home last year ? " it 's the same color as always , ' @entity40 told @entity50			2
@entity7 says she 's been dying her hair for three years now , and never received a complaint about it at school before while the principal has not offered an explanation for @entity7 's dismissal , schools superintendent @entity55 told @entity50 that he stands by the decision			1
' the principal is just following the policy			0
several girls were sent home for hair color , ' @entity62 said			0
' most everyone complied and came back and are back in class			0
' ' the policy was put in place years ago , ' @entity68 said , adding that it ' very rarely ever comes up as an issue ' and was created to ' provide a safe environment conducive to learning			0
' @entity7 complied with the school 's policy and has since stripped the color out of her hair			2
she was allowed back in school the following day , but her parents intend to fight the absence and petition the school 's administration to let their daughter re-dye her hair			1
' she 's been a little down , ' @entity40 said			0
' she misses her hair color			0
i 'm upset for her			0
i just felt very angered that my child - a good student , no problems ever - is having her feet knocked out from under her on the first day of school			0
' if the school does not agree to the family 's terms , they intent to file a federal lawsuit .			2

@entity7 was sent home on the first day of school because administrators found her hair violated a rule against ' disruptive ' hair styles
the 15 - year - old says she 's been dying her hair for three years and never received a complaint before
family are now considering lawsuit against school if they do n't excuse absence and allow daughter to *change* her hair back
