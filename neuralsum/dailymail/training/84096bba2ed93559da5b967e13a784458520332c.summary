imagine watching a film with a friend on the same screen where you watch it through the eyes of the villain , but they have the hero ’s perspective			0
that ’s just one of the many uses for @entity14 glasses , a product developed by @entity16 based in @entity17 , @entity18			1
the ‘ smart glasses ’ have an additional layer of lenses that can flip up and down , giving viewers two different experiences - or even entirely different films - when staring at a cinema screen			1
when the lenses are flipped up and down they switch between two image streams , something that is commonly seen in 3d movies the company are currently seeking funding for their design on @entity37			1
the patent - pending eyewear uses filters to separate streams of @entity42 images			2
dual perspectives – watch a scene through one of two views , such as through the eyes of the hero or the villain			2
reveal and conceal – flipping the glasses could show and hide subtitles in multiple languages			0
adult content – the company says the glasses could let a parent and child , for example , switch between a @entity59 and 18 - rated version of a scene			2
hidden scenes – additional content could be hidden within a scene using the glasses			2
video games – the glasses could be used to hide objects and easter eggs in video game worlds			0
changed vision – @entity14 glasses could also be used to enhance gameplay , such as giving the player night - vision			1
by interspersing content within rapidly alternating frames of a movie , the technology could allow for some novel applications			0
these range from giving dual perspectives during a movie to providing subtitles for only those that want to see them			0
‘ when viewing content with @entity14 , the user simply moves the additional lenses in front to reveal hidden content , ’ the company writes on @entity37			1
‘ moving the additional lenses back restores the original content			0
’ the glasses make use of the fact that @entity42 movies work when two image streams are displayed simultaneously , but they are slightly offset			1
‘ in 3d entertainment , our brains then combine the two nearly - identical images , and thus depth is created , ’ says the company			0
using the two image streams separately , the illusion of two completely different scenes is created			1
in addition , having one side of the glasses up and the other down will produce a standard 3d effect			0
later this year the company is planning to show off the technology in a movie they created with actors @entity117 and @entity119			0
and backers of the project on @entity37 will be given early access to the premiere			0
one of the touted uses for the technology is the ability to watch hidden scenes from a movie by flipping up or down the lenses			1
here , for example , only viewers with the glasses flipped in one direction will see the ' monster ' sneaking up on actor @entity117			1

@entity18 firm @entity16 has unveiled their @entity14 glasses
they say the product can provide new experiences for movie - *goers*
for example , two viewers could watch different scenes at the same time
the tech works by using the two image streams employed in 3d movies
the lenses in the glasses can be flipped up and down for different views
