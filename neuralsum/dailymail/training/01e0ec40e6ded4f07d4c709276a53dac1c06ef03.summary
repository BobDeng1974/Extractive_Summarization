former referee and @entity2 columnist @entity0 believes refereeing is at the worst level he can remember referees chiefs have hit back at stinging criticism from the former head of @entity8 and insist standards have never been better			1
@entity10 has called for his successor @entity11 to be removed from his position with @entity8 and labelled the current crop of officials as the ' worst that we have seen ' , citing ' over 20 major errors ' during the @entity18 period			1
@entity8 would not respond directly but released statistics showing standards had improved in every available measure in the five years since @entity10 left the organisation			1
these include accuracy on major decisions , up to 95 per cent from 94.1 per cent , on decisions in the penalty box ( 98 per cent ) and offsides , 99 per cent compared to 92 per cent five years ago when @entity11 took over			2
referees ' chief @entity11 ( pictured ) should be removed from his position , said former boss @entity10 @entity10 watches a game at @entity32 ( left ) and during his days as a top - flight referee ( right ) @entity34 , pictured with @entity36 's @entity35 , is one of four officials @entity10 wants stood down @entity38 discusses a decision with @entity41 boss @entity40 at @entity42 's @entity38 awarded @entity43 two controversial penalties for handball - both of which were scored - against @entity48 at @entity49			1

@entity10 's attack was made on his website , which also sells refereeing kits and equipment and offers training courses			2
the @entity8 is standing firm , however , confident it has taken the right path since @entity10 's departure and that it is backed up by all the statistics			2
there are usually periods in every season where a series of controversial decisions puts the spotlight on to officials , and has led to football 's lawmakers to begin to consider video replays			2
that will be debated at the @entity92 at its next meeting in @entity94 on february 28 , though any final decision is likely to be a couple of years away with trials being needed first			0
@entity8 's latest figures show referees ' fitness has improved , especially in terms of sprints			0

' i share the view of one former top referee [ @entity0 ] that the current group of professional referees is the worst that we have seen			1
' the latest big game decision error was the stupid dismissal of @entity129 of @entity112 who himself was on the receiving end of a reckless challenge			0
