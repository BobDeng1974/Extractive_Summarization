@entity0 : @entity2 prime minister @entity1 has announced a ban on all boat refugees settling in the country @entity2 prime minister @entity1 has banned all illegal boat refugees from ever settling in the country			1
mr @entity1 announced on friday that all new unauthorised asylum - seekers will be sent to @entity9 under a regional resettlement deal , declaring future boat refugees will have ' no chance ' of staying in @entity2 as refugees			1
the tough move is designed to prevent people smugglers exploiting refugees and taking vast sums of money putting them on leaky wooden boats with false promises that they will be able to make @entity2 their home			1
in a blunt message to the people traffickers , mr @entity1 said : ' your business model is over			1
' these are nothing but false hopes , ' said mr @entity1 , who added that @entity2 would continue to take ' large numbers ' of genuine asylum - seekers through its refugee resettlement programme			1
the prime minister said he would impose the changes as soon as possible as he signed the agreement with the promise that there be no cap on the number of asylum - seekers being sent to @entity9 's @entity41 detention centre			1
' from now on , any asylum - seeker who arrives in @entity2 by boat will have no chance of being settled in @entity2 as refugees , ' mr @entity1 said in @entity46 at a press conference with @entity9 prime minister @entity48			1
' asylum - seekers taken to @entity50 will be sent to @entity41 and elsewhere in @entity9 for assessment of their refugee status			0
' if they are found to be genuine refugees they will be resettled in @entity9 - an emerging economy with a strong future , a robust democracy which is also a signatory to the @entity61 refugees convention			2
' if they are found not to be genuine refugees they may be repatriated to their country of origin or be sent to a safe third country other than @entity2			1
' mr @entity1 said the agreement did not specify an absolute limit to the number of refugees who could be resettled			1
crackdown : the tough move is designed to prevent people smugglers exploiting refugees and taking vast sums of money putting them on leaky wooden boats such as the one pictured , with false promises that they will be able to make @entity2 their home ' some will say it 's too hard - line , others will say it 's inadequate , ' mr @entity1 said of his plan , as he sought to present it as a ' balanced ' approach that lay between the opposing camps on border protection policy			1
with a federal election looming , mr @entity1 has been under fire from the @entity92 for doing nothing to stop the boats			1
he said : ' our responsibility as a government is to ensure that we have a robust system of border security and orderly migration , on the one hand , as well as fulfilling our legal and compassionate obligations under the refugees convention on the other			2
‚Äù immigration minister @entity105 said the new regime applied immediately - starting with those asylum seekers on board a vessel intercepted earlier yesterday			0
he said : ' people who are currently within the detention network - within @entity2 on @entity41 or on @entity112 - do not have these rules apply to them			1
' but from now , on vessels that are intercepted will have the new rules apply to them and it will be a couple of weeks because of the health checks ... before the first transfers take place			0
' mr @entity1 said the arrangement would apply for the next 12 months , and be subject to annual review			1
dangerous : there have been several examples of refugee - laden boats running into trouble including this one off @entity50 in 2010 when at least 27 asylum seekers died he said : ' our expectation ... is as this regional resettlement arrangement is implemented , and the message is sent loud and clear back up the pipeline , the number of boats will decline over time as asylum - seekers then make recourse to other , more normal @entity139 processes to have their claims assessed			0
' he acknowledged that the change would be subject to a court challenge and would add to budget outlays			0
the prime minister unveiled today 's agreement in the hope it will undermine the selling points used by people - smugglers , who have sent more than 15,000 asylum - seekers to @entity2 so far this year			1
while the @entity151 has dismissed mr @entity1 's ability to put his tough talk into action , mr @entity1 is using the new plan to try to address a major political vulnerability ahead of the federal election			2
@entity158 immediately welcomed the initiative as a ' very promising development '			0
' but it will never work with mr @entity1 in charge , ' the @entity151 leader said			2
he said it was @entity166 's fifth go at dealing with asylum - seekers and today 's agreement remained about processing ' not stopping the boats '			0
alternative : boat refugees will be sent to @entity9 instead ( file picture ) neither mr @entity1 nor mr @entity48 would say how many asylum - seekers would be sent to @entity9 , despite speculation earlier today that the arrangement would be capped at about 3000 people			1
mr @entity48 said : ' we will take as much as we can with the capacities that we have on the ground			0
' as you know we are building more capacity to take more refugees and asylum - seekers			0
' you ca n't simply estimate a number given you do n't know how many people are seeking such refugee status in the boats that are arriving			0
' we are hoping that the boats will stop and there will be nobody coming to @entity41 , and that is the objective of this arrangement			0
' mr @entity1 said @entity2 and @entity9 would deliver the message ' loud and clear ' to people - smuggling networks and criminal elements within @entity2 helping them			1
discussions : mr @entity1 hoped those @entity112 arrangements would be built on in the future			2
he said he had spoken with @entity61 secretary - general @entity200 ( pictured ) about the plan the hopes they offer their customers for the future are nothing but false hopes , ' he said			0
he acknowledged the implementation of the new regional approach would not be smooth			0
he added : ' we are bound to run into many unanticipated problems			0
we will tackle them one by one			0
' @entity2 will continue its cooperative offshore processing arrangements with @entity112			2
mr @entity1 hoped those @entity112 arrangements would be built on in the future			2
he said he had spoken with @entity61 secretary - general ban ki - moon about the plan			0
@entity2 also plans to convene an international conference of transit and destination countries to consider how to improve global arrangements for refugees			1
the conference would consider the adequacy of processing arrangements and how @entity2 , the @entity225 , @entity226 and other countries could deal better with the resettlement issues			2
mr @entity1 said @entity2 would also seek to develop more regional arrangements at a similar conference due to be hosted by @entity231			1
he said : we will also be working with regional partners on visa arrangements for certain countries around the world that have become source countries for irregular people movements			0
' the new policy increases federal spending on border protection to support an agreement with @entity9 that will see the detention centre on @entity41 expanded from the previous plan to lift its capacity to 600			0
in exchange for @entity9 's agreement , @entity2 will fund further aid initiatives			2
these include redeveloping a major referral hospital in @entity251 , @entity9 's second largest city , and assisting with its long - term management			0
@entity2 will also supply half the funding to reform @entity9 's university sector and in 2014 implement the recommendations of an @entity2 - @entity9 education review .			2
