by @entity0 last updated at 1:38 am on 27th october 2011 women will have the right to check if a current or potential boyfriend has a history of violence under a new scheme being considered in @entity7			1
the plans have been dubbed ‘ @entity17 ’ , after the horrific killing of 36 - year - old mother @entity10 by @entity11 a man she met on @entity13 who had a long record of violent behaviour against women			1
@entity17 is modelled on @entity18 ’ - the successful campaign to give parents the right to check on paedophiles in their area after the murder of schoolgirl @entity24			1
tragedy : @entity10 , 36 , was brutally murdered in 2009 by @entity11 , a man she had met on @entity13 who had a history of violence against women the @entity29 reported in july that former labour cabinet minister @entity30 was leading a campaign to introduce changes to current legislation			1
yesterday home secretary @entity34 launched a 12 - week consultation period to discuss how such a scheme would work and to decide whether it should go ahead			2
she said : ' i have been clear that ending violence against women and girls is a personal priority for me and this government			1
' domestic violence is a particularly dreadful form of abuse and i want us to constantly look at new ways of protecting victims and preventing tragic incidents from happening			2
' pledge : home secretary @entity49 said ending violence against women is a priority for the government with more and more women meeting men , who they know little about , on the internet many believe such a law is necessary to protect their safety			1
however , critics say the well - intentioned plan could jeopardise civil liberties			2
ms @entity10 was initially charmed by @entity62 ’s persona after meeting him online , but his violent side soon surfaced and he subjected her to a string of sexual assaults			2
after they split he strangled her and set on fire in @entity68 in february 2009			2
when he went on the run he was quickly dubbed the ‘ @entity70 ’			1
six days after ms @entity10 ’s body was found , @entity62 was discovered hanged in a derelict pub. ms @entity10 had first called police in october 2008 after he damaged her front door , threatened her with an iron and threatened to kill her			2
the @entity77 later ruled she had been badly let down by police			2
friends and family were shocked to discover that the killer had a history of violence against women , including repeated harassment , threats and the kidnapping at knifepoint of one of his other ex-girlfriends			1
after the inquest into ms @entity10 ’s death , coroner @entity92 wrote to the @entity95 to recommend a system of checks which has become the basis of @entity17			1
there are currently two options being discussed			0
a ' right to know ' scheme would give police the power to proactively disclose information about violent men to women or even alert the family members of vulnerable women			1
a second ' right to ask ' scheme would give women the right to ask police is a man had a history of violent behaviour			1
under the current law police can disclose previous convictions or charges to the public if they believe there is a pressing need to do so to prevent future crime			0
mrs may added : ' this scheme would be based on recognised and consistent processes that could enable new partners of previously violent suspects to know more about their partner 's history of abuse			0
' they could then make informed choices about how and whether they take that relationship forward			0

' ms @entity10 ’s father , @entity151 said he was ' absolutely delighted ' with the announcement			0
he told the @entity153 : ' anyone who 's being threatened by their partner should be able to find out if he 's done anything similar in the past			0
' my daughter did n't know and i do n't want any other family to go through what we 've had to			0
' it should make a big difference to those ladies who are in a vulnerable position - it 'll mean they can make informed decisions about what to do next			0
' in a previous interview with the @entity29 he said : ' my daughter was n’t stupid			0
if she had known about that man ’s past , she would have taken herself out of there in a heartbeat			1
’ however @entity177 mp @entity176 , a member of the @entity178 , warned any such scheme would need to be carefully controlled to avoid abuse			0
he said : ‘ we ’re all in favour of curbing violence against women but we have to be certain this will not lead to fishing expeditions by women demanding confidential information about potential boyfriends without proper justification			1
‘ you can not have a carte blanche system where people can simply turn up at a police station , give the name of a boyfriend or potential boyfriend , and expect the police to open up all the files on him			0
' there will have to be strict controls on any proposal of this nature			0
