if only the second half of @entity3 games counted , it would be @entity4 and not @entity5 sitting top of the table			1
@entity8 are currently second in the division , six points behind @entity12 's league leaders after three consecutive victories			0
but @entity15 's men have a superior record in the second half of games and would actually be two points clear of the @entity19 outfit if only final 45 minutes mattered			2
@entity20 ( centre ) and his @entity4 team - mates would be top if only the second half counted @entity3 leaders @entity5 would still be top of the division if games finished after 45 minutes the reigning champions have effectively earned 30 points in the second half of games this season - two more than rivals @entity5 , who have drawn seven of their 14 second periods			1
the west @entity32 side would still be top of the league if games finished at half - time , although they would have some unfamiliar names attempting to chase them down			2
@entity36 , who are currently seventh , would be in second place on 24 points , while 11th placed @entity40 would be third on goal difference			0
@entity4 would be down in fourth if only the first half of games counted , another indicator of their impressive second - half displays this term			0
@entity46 ( left ) and his @entity36 team - mates would be second in the league if only the first - half counted @entity50 's @entity40 are 11th at present but they would be up in third if games finished at half - time football analysts @entity53 believe @entity4 are strong favourites to beat @entity40 this weekend @entity54 are ninth in the @entity3 and chasing a @entity56 spot but @entity58 's men would be bottom of the table if matches were only 45 minutes long			1
the @entity62 have earned just nine points with their first half performances , leaving them below @entity65 and @entity66 ( both 12 points ) in the relegation zone			0
@entity69 currently occupy the fourth @entity56 spot but @entity72 's side would be fifth if games finished at half - time and sixth if only the second period counted			1
@entity58 has see his @entity54 side improve sigificantly in the second - half of matches this season @entity79 ( centre ) and his @entity69 team - mates are outside the top four on both tables @entity83 shot up to 12th with victory at @entity85 earlier this week but @entity87 's men would be rock bottom if only the second - half mattered , having earned the equivalent of just eight points with some lacklustre displays after the break			1
it 's the reverse for @entity95 , whose performances after @entity99 's half - time team talks have led to an improvement in form			0
the @entity102 would be down in 13th if referees blew the full - time whistle after the first - half but fourth if only the second period counted towards their points total			2
@entity95 's players celebrate after @entity108 ( second from right ) sealed a late win against @entity111			0

@entity4 would be two points clear of @entity5 if games finished at half - time rather than after *90* minutes
@entity54 would be bottom if only the opening period counted
@entity12 's men would still be top based on their first - half displays
@entity40 and @entity36 have been much better before the break this season
