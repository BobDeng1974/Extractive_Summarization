last month @entity0 landed herself in hot water among @entity4 's middle class mums when she mocked an email sent to fellow parents asking for cash donations for a child 's present			1
amid the fall - out - compounded by her own sarcastic response on social media - the 36 - year - old was confronted at the school gates by mothers who felt betrayed , and was even ticked off in a round robin email from the £ 5,000 - a - year school 's headteacher			1
but in a new interview with fabulous magazine , the designer and @entity22 presenter said : ' this is why i keep getting myself in trouble			2
i ca n't keep my mouth shut			0
but that 's who i am			2
' @entity0 in 2011 with her daughter @entity29 , now seven , says she ' ca n't keep her mouth shut ' opening up about her decision to post two emails from mothers of her seven - year - old daughter @entity29 's classmates , @entity0 said : ' i want my children to receive yo - yos and give yo - yos , not @entity39			1
being happy is not about stuff			0
' i know it does n't make me popular but this is what i stand for			0
i was n't raised like that			0
' the designer , who has a line of @entity48 clothes , considered the potential backlash and reaction to posting the emails last month - which it has now emerged could be a year old - but went ahead anyway			2
she shared two emails from her fellow mums which were sent out to help organise a group present for their daughters , with her 459,200 followers on @entity59 and 75,000 on @entity60			1
the messages , which @entity0 posted under the hashtag # bonkers , soon went viral			1
the first email read : ‘ @entity64 and @entity65 would prefer a class birthday gift for their daughters this year			2
@entity68 would like a kindle and @entity70 a desk ( very studious choices ! ) so if you would like to join in , please can i collect a suggested £ 10 from you before the party on february 9			0
‘ if you prefer to send £ via an envelope in your daughters [ sic ] school bag , marked for @entity64 / me that works too			0
i will pass on a voucher and card to each at the party			0
@entity84 [ sic ] and no obligation of course			0
’ @entity0 looked unworried by the furore at @entity89 premiere last week a second email from another parent who offers to collect the cash reiterates that £ 10 would be a ‘ popular amount ’ to contribute – meaning that the total value of the gifts would be at least £ 200 – but adds : ‘ feel free to give what you like or indeed , to give your own gift			1
’ @entity0 then posted her own response with the sarcastic heading , ' let 's put the fun back into birthdays ' saying she was going to collect money to buy @entity29 a unicorn and that she 'd ' like a @entity106 and @entity107 , so by all means , do feel obligated to contribute to this too			1
’ and making it clear she thought the original request was bad manners , she ended her retort by saying the money could be donated to a fictitious site – www.getwhatyoure-givenandendthismadness.com			0
but the designer , who has her own @entity48 brand of clothes , underwear , hair and beauty products , says she 's undaunted by controversy , describing herself as ' fearless '			0
@entity0 caused a backlash from mothers around the country when she posted fellow school mums ' emails about collecting cash contributions for their daughter 's presents @entity0 caused further outrage with her sarcastic response titled , ' let 's put the fun back into @entity136 ! ' she further explained her rationale in an article in the @entity139 , explaining she was ' amazed ' by the emails when she first received them and posted - what she thought was - a ' humourous response '			1
@entity0 wrote : ' one mum did explain that she feels 26 presents is an awful lot for any child to get , and a lot of it is plastic rubbish			1
' she saw the email as problem - solving , and i understand what she meant , but the joy of getting a gift of some felt - tips and a yo - yo when you ’re a kid ca n’t be diminished			1
surely that ’s what you ’d rather have for your seventh birthday , not a @entity165 or a desk			2
' @entity0 , whose career was rebooted by starring on i 'm a celebrity and notably featured her showering in a white bikini , also opened up to fabulous about the end of her marriage to celebrity minder @entity173 , the father of her two daughters and husband of six months			2
she said that for the first year after their split , she was ' reeling from the heartache '			0
but she believes in ' the sanctity of marriage ' , adding , ' you 're either in or you 're out , you ca n't just be half in it and because i believe in those things so strongly , when those beliefs are rocked you question so much			0
' @entity186 , @entity187 and presenter @entity0 is a single mother to @entity29 , seven , and hero , three ,			1

@entity0 , 36 , explains why she shared a fellow mum 's email
