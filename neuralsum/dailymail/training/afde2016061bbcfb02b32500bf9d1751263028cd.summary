by @entity0 published : 11:23 est , 24 august 2012 updated : 11:23 est , 24 august 2012 the number of cases of measles has almost doubled in the past year following two major outbreaks , health officials have revealed			1
in @entity7 and @entity8 there were 497 cases in the first six months of 2011			1
but this year that figured has soared to 964 over the equivalent period , the @entity10 revealed			2
a spokesman said the cases have been associated with ongoing outbreaks in @entity16 and @entity17 , and a small number of cases have occurred in @entity7 's travelling communities			1
hives : the skin of a person suffering from measles it is thought the rise is due to continued low vaccine uptake in some parts of the country			2
in 1998 dr @entity30 linked the jab to cases of autism and bowel disorders but the research was later discredited and he was struck off the medical register - but fearsstill linger			1
the number of cases of rubella - also known as @entity42 measles - have also increased			1
the @entity10 said 57 cases of the viral infection were reported between january and june - exceeding the annual totals for the previous nine years			1
most cases are linked to travel to other @entity48 @entity47 is usually a mild infection			1
but if a woman becomes infected in early pregnancy , it can cause birth defects			2
officials said parents should ensure that their children have received the @entity58 jab - the combined vaccine that protects against measles , mumps and rubella - before going back to school			2
disappearing disease : cases had dramatically fallen in the past half century in 1998 a paper in the medical journal @entity68 by @entity30 presented apparent evidence that autism spectrum disorders could be caused by the @entity58 - an immunisation against measles , mumps and rubella			1
but an investigation by @entity76 journalist @entity75 revealed that mr @entity30 had multiple undeclared conflicts of interest , had manipulated evidence , and had broken other ethical codes			2
the published paper was partially retracted in 2004 and fully retracted in 2010 , and @entity30 was found guilty by the @entity81 of serious professional misconduct in may 2010 and was struck off			0
the following year the research was declared fraudulent by the @entity84			0
the scientific consensus is that no evidence links the vaccine to the development of autism and that the vaccine 's benefits greatly outweigh its risks			0
latest data on immunisations across @entity7 shows uptake rates of 93 per cent for the first @entity58 jab and 87 per cent for the second			0
in @entity8 , the figures are 92 per cent and 87 per cent			0
the first dose of the @entity58 vaccine should ideally be given to children between 12 to 13 months of age			0
they are given the second dose before they start school , usually between three and five years of age , although it can be given three months after the first			0
dr @entity108 , head of immunisation at the @entity10 , said : ' it 's extremely concerning that measles cases are continuing to rise			1
' measles can be very serious and parents should understand the risks associated with the infection , which in severe cases can result in death			1
' it 's vital that children receive both doses of the @entity58 vaccination and ahead of returning to school after the holidays , we are urging parents to ensure their children have received the two doses , which will provide the best protection against the risks associated with measles , mumps and rubella			0
' if you are unsure if your child has had two doses of the vaccination , speak to your gp who will have a record of which vaccinations your child has received			0
' @entity141 , professor of paediatrics at the @entity143 , said : ' measles is an entirely preventable disease so it is very sad to see that the numbers of cases are going up			1
' it 's a thoroughly unpleasant illness and , from time to time , unpredictably , can turn very serious or even fatal			0
' you ca n't get too many doses of vaccine , only too few - anything less than two - so if you are in doubt about yourself or your child , find out and , if necessary , get the @entity58 vaccine which will protect you against mumps and rubella as well			0
you can be immunised safely and effectively at any age			0
