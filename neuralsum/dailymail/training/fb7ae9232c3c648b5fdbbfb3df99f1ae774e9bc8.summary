most scuba divers want to stay as far away from the gaping jaws of crocodiles as possible , but a pair of @entity5 photographers got close enough to one beast 's teeth to be its dentists			1
@entity9 , 62 , and his wife @entity10 , 41 , took close - up pictures of @entity12 the crocodile in december 2014 at @entity14 , @entity15			1
taken just inches from the jaws of the reptile , the photographs show the stunning beauty of the three - metre deadly predator , whose name means little boy in @entity23			0
the @entity28 crocodile then swam out of the trees to see them - allowing the @entity48 to capture the extraordinary pictures			1
@entity51 ' guides have been working with @entity12 since he was very small , so he is now quite used to photographers getting close			2

the husband and wife team , who have been working together for 12 years as dive instructors and underwater photographers , said that the shallow water proved a challenging environment			0

mr @entity9 said : ' we got into the water with the croc and got so close his teeth were almost touching our camera housings			0
though @entity12 is used to attention , the @entity5 snappers were wary of being snapped at suddenly by the scaly swimmer			0
' it is a wild animal , so you have to be very careful , moving slowly and smoothly in the water so as not to startle or scare the croc			0
' the @entity48 were worried that the sediment in the shallow water would make their pictures murky and limit the detail of the croc guide @entity39 helped lure the crocodile over to the photographers in scuba gear so that they could capture the amazing images of @entity12 ' whilst we never felt in danger , as the croc was moving in a very easy going way , it is still an amazing , adrenalin - filled experience , ' mr @entity9 said			1
only 700 divers are permitted to go each year to @entity14 , a national park that is a seven - hour bus ride and additional six - hour boat ride from @entity88			1
mr @entity9 , who has also photographed fish , sharks and manatees , called the experience was ' well worth it ' because of the ' pristine reefs and amazing animal encounters			0
