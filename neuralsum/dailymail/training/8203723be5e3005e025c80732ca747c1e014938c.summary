by @entity1 reporter the @entity2 has found a unique way to keep its mammoth @entity5 elephants in line when a human being ca n't do the job , and that 's a pair of 25 - pound @entity11 cattle dogs			1
@entity12 and @entity13 are the zoo 's secret weapon , giving staff an important safety buffer when dealing with the giant animals			1
' it was a safety issue initially around some dangerous animals and the dogs just kind of fit right into there , ' @entity19 , the elephant manager at the @entity2 , told reporters			1
' they were an extra piece to the puzzle and helped out immensely			0
' at the @entity2 , dogs @entity12 and @entity13 have made a name for themselves by becoming great elephant herders keeping the mammoth @entity5 elephants can be dangerous business without a safety zone like the one the dog 's provide , said zoo officials as the dogs are bred to move livestock , herding the elephants comes naturally to them			1
' if you are dealing with say a dangerous animal , it kind of gives you that added advantage ( to know ) , ' the elephant 's not so focused on me , '' @entity19 told @entity46			0
' now , the elephants have to watch that dog to see what they are going to do , so that they are going to become actually more responsive to me			0
' so respected are the brave canines that the elephants will perk up if they even hear a handler call one of their names			2
with the dogs in the enclosure , elephants wo n't come within 25 yards of their keeper they also become alerted upon hearing the dog 's licenses jingle as they run around a corner			1
yet @entity19 said the dogs are much more than simply a pair of aggressive guards , meeting children visiting the zoo with warm and loving welcomes			1
' these dogs are actually love dogs			2
they would be would be great family dogs because when they are not working , they will go out , interact with the public			0
they love just being petted , and i mean , they are in heaven , ' he said			0
when they are n't herding elephants , the dogs love playing with children visiting the zoo the practice of using dogs to herd zoo animals remains so rare @entity2 is the only facility in the @entity90 to use them			1
' other than the institute in @entity93 , i think we are one of the very few zoos that actually use them around the elephants , ' @entity19 said			0
but @entity12 and @entity13 have been so successful other zoos are now visiting just to watch them work			1
the dogs provide important safety			0
in 2002 , keeper @entity101 was killed by a female elephant at the @entity2 zoo			1
without the dogs present , @entity46 cameras captured the elephants walking over to @entity19 to nuzzle him with their trunks			2
besides providing security , the dogs help the elephants exercise			2
a baby elephant even rolled onto her back on the ground alongside him			0
without safety precautions elephants commonly attack people and killed on man at the @entity2 in 2002 but when he walked in with the dogs , the elephants would give him a distance of at least 25 to 30 yards			1
unless @entity123 commanded the dogs to stay and walked away from them , he could not walk up close to the elephants			2
' it 's kind of like having a second set of eyes , ' he said			0
' again , by watching the elephants , you can see they ( the elephants ) are more keyed on the dogs than they are on us			0

@entity12 and @entity13 keep the elephants at a safe distance when their keeper visits
the *sweet* canines love playing with children visiting the zoo
the @entity2 is the only zoo in the @entity90 to use dogs this way
