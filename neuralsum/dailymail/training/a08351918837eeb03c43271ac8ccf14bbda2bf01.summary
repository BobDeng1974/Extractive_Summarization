victory : @entity1 was one of three killers to appeal to the @entity3 against their whole life terms victims ’ families reacted with fury last night after @entity9 judges ruled serial killers must be given the right to seek parole			1
in a hugely provocative decision , @entity13 said murderers and rapists condemned to die behind bars must now be given a chance of freedom			1
the families said the idea of the killers walking @entity23 ’s streets again was a ‘ horrendous prospect ’ and ‘ life must mean life ’			1
the whole - life tariff applies to 48 men and one woman – @entity30 – whose crimes courts regard as so heinous they must never be let out			0
but three of them – @entity1 , @entity33 and @entity34 – appealed to @entity9 , saying their sentences ‘ undermined human dignity and destroyed the human spirit ’			1
@entity33 and @entity1 even claimed their time in jail had left them ‘ depressed and in despair ’			1
yesterday the highest body of the @entity3 , the @entity3 , agreed with them			1
it said refusing the 49 any prospect of release amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment in a breach of @entity51 of the @entity52			0
all the killers must now be allowed a review – with the prospect of release if they have been ‘ rehabilitated ’ and are deemed harmless			0
victims : @entity1 was convicted of murdering his adoptive sister @entity58 , left , and parents @entity59 and june , right			1
with a rifle in 1985 battle : @entity1 with girlfriend @entity63 at the funeral of three of his family members			2
he was later convicted of murdering them @entity69 @entity68 said the ruling was an attack on democracy that exposed the court ’s ‘ warped moral compass ’			2
justice secretary @entity75 spoke of ‘ a terrible day for @entity23 justice ’			1
ministers are already in a stand - off with the court over its demand to lift the ban on prisoners voting and are furious over its decisions in favour of terrorists and criminals			0
writing in today ’s @entity88 , mr @entity75 threatened to withdraw from the court ’s control after the next election , and accused the judges of being ‘ misguided ’ and trying to act like a ‘ @entity93 of @entity9 ’			2
@entity94 , whose father @entity95 was @entity34 ’s third victim , said she was ‘ extremely upset ’ the killer could be released			2
the 45 - year - old mother of three , from @entity98 in @entity99 , said : ‘ this man took away multiple lives in a horrific and premeditated way – why should he have the rights that he denied my father and his other victims ? horrors : @entity30 , left , who helped her husband @entity107 kill ten young women at their house in @entity110 including their daughter @entity111 , right given hope : @entity113 and accomplice @entity114 were convicted of murdering three children and burying them in the 1960s ‘ for the last 16 years , our family have derived comfort from the knowledge that @entity34 would never be allowed to walk the streets again because of what he did			1
now we urgently want to know if this means he can apply for parole , which would be a horrendous prospect			0
’ @entity34 , known as the ‘ @entity125 ’ , killed four men in less than four months in 1995 , stabbing them with a combat knife for ‘ fun ’			2
@entity129 , 53 , whose brother @entity131 , 28 , was @entity34 ’s second victim , said : ‘ he ’s less than human – why should he have rights ? did he consider @entity136 ’s human rights when he decapitated him and did other unspeakable , twisted things to his body ? ‘ there is no way he can get parole , he must die in prison			1
life should mean life , he does not deserve a second chance			0
’ the court indicated the lifers should first be given a review after 25 years inside and then every few years afterwards if their appeal fails			0
if ministers were to bow to the court ’s demands , it would mean six lifers would instantly be entitled to demand their freedom			0
they include @entity1 , @entity157 , who killed 16 men in @entity159 in the late 70s and early 80s , and @entity160 , who murdered six people including one child in the mid- 70s			2
the court heard that a whole - life sentence had repeatedly been ruled lawful by the @entity23 courts , including as recently as last year			1
in 2003 , the @entity166 said there was no reason why a crime or crimes should n’t merit it just for ‘ pure punishment ’			0
bleak : volunteers search for victims of @entity175 lord @entity176 observed that ‘ there are cases where the crimes are so wicked that even if the prisoner is detained until he or she dies it will not exhaust the requirements of retribution and deterrence ’			0
but , by a margin of 16 to one , the judges , including those from @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 , ruled in favour of the killers			0
they said the authorities should review such sentences to see if the inmate has made ‘ progress towards rehabilitation ’ and keeping them behind bars was no longer justified			0
the judgment can not be appealed			0
appeal : convicted killers @entity34 , left , and @entity33 , right , said their whole life sentences ' undermined human dignity and destroyed the human spirit ' award : the killers took their case to the @entity3 in @entity13 former labour lord chancellor , @entity211 , criticised the ruling which he said could mean the courts could never pass a sentence of longer than 25 years – because anyone reaching that point would automatically be entitled to a parole hearing			1
justice secretary @entity75 described the ruling as ' a terrible day for @entity23 justice ' ministers are expected to resist implementing the ruling , but in time this could lead to compensation claims from the prisoners who are denied a review			1
@entity226 was said to be ‘ very , very , very , very disappointed ’ with the decision			0
home secretary @entity228 , a staunch critic of the court , told the @entity230 the public would be dismayed			0
@entity69 ex-justice minister @entity232 said : ‘ this is one more dreadful judgement from this discredited court , after trying to give prisoners the vote and obstructing the deportation of terrorist suspects			2
‘ once again they have put us in the intolerable position where our own @entity242 and courts no longer have the final say on justice			0
the time has come to withdraw from the @entity3 and decide these matters for ourselves			2
’ @entity69 mp for @entity249 and @entity250 , @entity251 , said : ‘ it shows the warped moral compass of the @entity3 that it allows three brutal murderers to sue @entity23 for inhuman treatment for jailing them for life to protect the public			1
’ @entity1 ’s lawyer , @entity259 , praised the ruling as ‘ progressive and humane ’ .			1
