@entity0 transformed himself to take on his latest role as the deadliest shot in @entity4 military history in ' @entity5 '			1
he ate 5,000 calories a day to pack on 40 pounds - from 185 to 225 - to play real life hero @entity7 , who was credited with 160 kills while fighting in @entity9			1
the handsome actor is almost unrecognizable from his previous role as a party boy in ' @entity13 ' or dashing red carpet style as he sports a bushy beard and a thick @entity17 drawl to add to the dramatic change			0
but before he could slip into the role of the one - man killing machine in @entity23 's film , @entity0 had to learn how to shoot a sniper rifle			1
and for that expertise he turned to one of @entity7 's close friends , former @entity28 sniper @entity26 who served two tours of duty			1
despite having never fired a rifle before , @entity0 proved a natural , @entity26 tells @entity32			1
' the first time i saw @entity35 hardly recognized him , ' said @entity26 who left the @entity28 to train as a physician 's assistant			1
' i knew what he looked like from @entity13 and @entity39 , but he just took my breath away			0
' when he was kitted out in the full combat gear he could easily have passed for @entity7			2
' it was just amazing to watch him transform into the character			0
real - life @entity28 @entity26 trained @entity0 and starred in the film quick study : @entity0 learned his lessons well from @entity26 , who was a @entity28 teammate of @entity7 , @entity26 was hired to play the role of himself after originally coming on as the technical advisor for the film @entity0 has to gain about 40 pounds - from 185 to 225 - to be convincing as the @entity4 sniper @entity7 @entity26 said @entity0 was so good at shooting that he could easily train as a sniper with the military			1
' i was surprised at just how good @entity0 was with a sniper rifle and live rounds , ' said @entity26			1
' we went out to a shooting range and @entity0 just took to it straight away			2
' he quickly picked up that you have to use your whole body when looking down a sniper 's scope			2
every muscle has to be relaxed , except the trigger finger			0
' so much of what snipers do is in the @entity79 have to have the right mind set as you are looking directly at the person you are going to kill			0
it 's not like you are in a plane firing a missile but looking at the person who is going to die			0
' @entity26 , , 33 , said 40 - year - old @entity0 was hungry to learn about the techniques of being a deadly shot which led to the man he plays in the film being known by his @entity28 comrades as ' @entity91			1
' ' @entity0 soon became very accurate and comfortable handling the weapon , ' said @entity93			2
' he also wanted to learn about other combat techniques , how to clear a house and close - armed combat			2
he continually sent me questions to find out as much as he could about @entity9			2
' he immersed himself in the role so much i was so impressed			0
' during filming in @entity100 - which doubled for the city of @entity102 during the 2006 insurgency in @entity9 - @entity0 lay on a rooftop and took aim at a figure in the distance			1
around him were burnt out buildings , spent bullet casings and the sound of grenades exploding			0
after pulling the trigger on a replica gun , a stuntman in the distance fell down as veteran director @entity23 captured the scene			0
' @entity0 was looking down the scope , pulled the trigger and saw the body fall			2
' afterwards he just said " wow "			0
he understood then the power of the sniper and what they can do			0
' until then he had been shooting on a range , but now it was driven home to him the sort of work that @entity7 and i did in @entity9			1
' ' when @entity0 was kitted out in the full combat gear , ' says @entity26 , he could easily have passed for @entity7			1
it was just amazing to watch him transform into the character ' @entity26 trained @entity0 on how to hold and shoot the various weapons that @entity7 utilized			1
@entity0 never equaled the shot from 2,100 yards @entity7 once made in @entity9 , but he was able to hit targets from 600 yards			1
@entity26 responded the way @entity28 often respond to superb performance : he said nothing @entity26 says when he saw @entity0 kitted out in the full combat gear he could easily have passed for @entity7			1
' it was just amazing to watch him transform into the character ' besides being the film 's technical director , @entity26 , who joined the seals in response to the terror attack on 9/11 , was also asked to appear as himself			1
' while i was teaching @entity0 how to handle the weapons he suggested to @entity23 that i should play myself , ' he said			2
' i was a bit surprised , but @entity0 said why should they get an actor when i could play the part myself			2
' @entity26 made a short audition tape and it was approved by @entity23			2
the dad of two spent three weeks filming in @entity100 and later in @entity155			0
being around the sights and sounds of battle brought back the memories of his deployment to @entity9 with @entity161 3 , one of the elite units that make up the @entity4 military special forces			2
' it did bring back certain memories , not all of them pleasant			0
war is a terrible and seeing how the set designers had recreated some of the places made me think			0
' @entity26 was born and raised in @entity172 , @entity173			2
he had planned to become a doctor but after a friend 's dad was killed in the 9/11 terror attack he enrolled in the military			2
. after leaving the @entity28 he trained as a physician assistant and now lives on @entity181 's @entity180			1
@entity7 had already served two tours in @entity9 when he met @entity93			1
such was @entity7 's skill as a sniper he was credited by @entity4 military chiefs with 160 confirmed kills			1
one of his most spectacular shots was killing a man armed with a rocket launcher from a distance of 2,100 yards			1
he became known as the ' @entity191 ' by insurgents who put a bounty on his head because he was causing so many casualties			0
while @entity7 was a one - man killing machine in 2006 , his first ever sniper kill was a woman who was carrying a bomb in @entity201 in 2003 as she approached a platoon of @entity203			1
the majority of those he killed were insurgents fighting the @entity4 forces in the years after the 2003 @entity9 invasion			0
in his best selling autobiography , on which the film is based , @entity7 claims to have killed a further 100 insurgents in combat			2
he would take up a position overlooking a town that was being searched for insurgents and pick them off with his high powered .338 @entity217 rifle			0
during his four tours of duty he also suffered multiple injuries from grenade shrapnel and being blown up by roadside bombs			0
while @entity7 reveled in being a @entity28 the film also explores his troubled home life with wife @entity225 , played by @entity226			1
' while i was teaching @entity0 how to handle the weapons he suggested to @entity23 that i should play myself , ' @entity26 said			1
he made a short audition tape and it was approved by @entity23			0
' so much of what snipers do is in the mind , ' says @entity26			0
' you have to have the right mind set as you are looking directly at the person you are going to kill			0
@entity0 got that ' unlike many @entity237 films ' @entity5 ' does not have a happy ending			0
almost two years ago @entity7 was murdered on a shooting range by a @entity203 who was said to be suffering from @entity241			0
@entity7 , 33,had taken @entity243 shooting in a bid to help the 26 - year - old adjust to civilian life			2
when he arrived at the range near @entity248 , @entity243 grabbed a gun and shot @entity7 and his friend @entity250 dead			1
@entity243 , who goes on trial next month , will claim through his lawyers that he was suffering from ptsd and mentally unstable when he killed @entity254			0
so many people wanted to attend @entity7 's funeral to pay their tribute to a war hero it was held inside the @entity261 's stadium to accommodate the mourners			1
@entity263 said @entity7 's death came just a day after the script for the film was completed			1
@entity0 and @entity23 later traveled to @entity17 to meet @entity7 's father @entity267 to talk him about the film			1
they both vowed to honor the memory of his son and promised the family would not be disappointed with the finished result			0
@entity0 went on a 5,000 a day diet to bulk up his weight so he was the same size as @entity7			1
he never met @entity7 in person but spoke to him on the phone			0
' i know @entity0 wanted to do the @entity272 proud and he has certainly done that , says @entity26			1
' @entity7 was a special person with a big heart who loved his family and loved his country			0
' @entity7 's widow @entity225 also gave her approval to the film			1
she flew to @entity287 before production began to meet with 84 - year - old @entity23 , @entity0 and @entity226 who plays her in the film			2
like @entity7 's family she was worried the film would somehow dishonor her husband 's memory			1
but after seeing ' @entity5 ' she was thrilled with the result and said @entity0 kept a promise to her that he would not do anything to ruin the honor of husband or her marriage			0
' i left feeling like a weight had been lifted			0
they really pulled it off			0
it 's an authentic , genuine look at two people who love each other and what our veterans go through and what they carry , ' she said			0
' so many of @entity7 's friends who have seen the movie have said they did n't feel like they were even watching an actor			1
it 's been that way without fail			0
' everyone who knows him and loves him has said that			0
