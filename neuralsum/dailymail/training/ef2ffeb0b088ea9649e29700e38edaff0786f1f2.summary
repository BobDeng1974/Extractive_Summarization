@entity0 ’s will start giving customers the choice of a salad , fruit or vegetable as a substitute for french fries in its value meals in a bid to target consumers wanting healthier options			1
@entity13 will roll out the change early next year in the @entity15 , where people will be able to pick a salad instead of fries at no extra cost			1
@entity0 ’s says it already lets customers make such swaps in some countries , such as @entity24			1
healthy options : @entity0 's will start letting customers swap fries for salads in the new year for no extra cost in value meals but now it says it now work to make the options available in 20 of its biggest markets around the world , which represent 85 percent of sales			1
@entity0 ’s , which has more than 34,000 locations around the world , said the change will be in place in 30 to 50 percent of the areas within the next three years and 100 percent the regions by 2020			2
the world ’s biggest hamburger chain made the announcement at the @entity47 in @entity48 , where ceo @entity49 made an appearance on stage with former president @entity52			1
in an interview before the announcement , @entity49 said @entity0 ’s is looking at developing other healthy sides that will appeal to customers			1
he noted that the company could also take the fruits and vegetables it offers in other parts of the world , such as cups of corn and kiwi on a stick , and make them more widely available			0
' what is it that customers will choose , and what will they eat ? ' @entity49 said			1
' what we do n’t want to do is just put something on the menu and say , hey , we did it			0
' value pack : the humble hamburger is usually accompanied by fries in @entity0 's value meals , but soon vegetables and fruit will be an option @entity0 ’s also announced that it would use its packaging to make healthier options more appealing to kids			1
for example , a side of carrots might come in a more colorfully designed bag			0
parents will still be able to order soda with @entity93 , but @entity0 ’s says it will only promote milk , juice and water on menu boards and in advertising			2
all advertising to kids will include a ' fun nutrition or children ’s well - being ' message , the company said			0
@entity106 , director of nutrition policy at the health advocacy group @entity107 , said taking soda off the menu as an option for @entity93 was a big step that other fast - food chains should follow			0
but she said the push to include positive nutrition messages in ads to kids could serve to give @entity0 ’s a ' health halo ' that it does n’t necessarily deserve			2
' the changes @entity0 ’s are making make the food somewhat healthier			2
but i do n’t think a hamburger , some applies and fries is something i ’d call healthy , ' she said			0
@entity0 's is also trying to encourage consumers to drink low fat milk drinks instead of sodas the announcement comes as @entity0 ’s faces criticism from health advocates who say it promotes bad eating habits			1
after years of outperforming its rivals , @entity0 ’s is also struggling to shake its fast - food image and keep up with shifting tastes			2
late last year , the company reported its first monthly sales decline in nearly a decade and sales performance around the world has been choppy ever since			0
to better reflect the way people are eating , @entity0 ’s recently started giving customers the choice to substitute egg whites in all its breakfast sandwiches			1
it also rolled out chicken wraps , which are partly intended to go after people who want foods they feel are fresher or healthier			0
earlier in the week , rival @entity154 rolled out lower - calorie french fries , reflecting the growing demand for better - for - you options			0
@entity0 ’s marketing to children is also an ongoing issue			2
a recent study by the @entity164 , for example , found that the chain ’s ads targeting children often emphasize toy giveaways and movie tie - ins , rather than food			0
and at its latest annual shareholders meeting , a 9 - year - old girl made headlines after she stood to ask @entity49 to stop ' tricking ' kids into eating the company ’s food			1
the girl was with her mother , who was affiliated with @entity179 , which has pressured @entity0 ’s to changes its marketing practices to kids			0
the criticism is clearly a sensitive topic for @entity49 , who noted that the @entity185 for a @entity186 was among the first organizations that approached the company to use its “ marketing might ” to help kids			1
the group , which is working with @entity0 ’s on its new health goals , was founded by the @entity47 and the @entity193			1
“ others have said , ‘ @entity13 , do n’t advertise to kids , ’ ” @entity49 said			0
“ we ’ve always felt like , wow , if we had the impact that you think we have , why do n’t we leverage it to do something great for kids ? ” @entity200 , ceo of @entity185 for a healthier generation , said the commitments made by @entity13 were worked out over the course of more than a year			0
he said the final agreement could help change the way people eat over time , given @entity0 ’s enormous reach .			0
