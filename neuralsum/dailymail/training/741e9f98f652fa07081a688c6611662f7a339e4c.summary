‘ the thing about the @entity5 is that the best sights are underwater , ’ said my taxi driver as he drove along the dusty road from the airport			0
‘ there ’s just not a great deal above sea level			1
’ after a week exploring the trio of @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity14 islands which make up the @entity5 , i had to disagree			0
while the @entity5 ( the name comes from the word for crocodile , although they were originally named @entity5 by @entity19 due to all the turtles he saw swimming there ) lack the ‘ bling ’ factor of their @entity24 neighbours such as @entity25 and @entity26 or the flamboyant night - life of @entity28 or @entity29 , it is certainly not just a diving - only destination			1
the diving in the @entity5 is spectacular but there 's plenty for non-divers to see too with spectacular beaches plus luxury hotels , a vibrant restaurant scene including a ‘ @entity40 ’ on @entity11 where you can visit four or five different restaurants in a night , sampling the menu of each and the deliciously warm @entity24 climate , there is certainly more than enough to keep landlubbers happy			1
however diving is what the @entity5 are best known for and the main reason for my trip			0
as a complete novice at scuba - diving i had to start from scratch			2
before i left the @entity55 i spent two evenings submerged in a swimming pool in central @entity58 being taught the basics of scuba - diving , including how to get to grips with the breathing apparatus and ways of communicating underwater			1
the clear blue water and warm climate make @entity11 a perfect place for swimming and sailing between lessons , i completed the theory part of the course online , which covered the technical aspects such as the effects of depth and pressure , so my precious hours out in the @entity24 would n’t be spent in a classroom			1
eight hours of late night studying later i had passed all the modules and was ready to go			0
the 11 - hour flight included a refuelling stop in @entity81 , @entity82 and i was soon being driven to my hotel , the @entity84			2
like other international hotel brands such as the next - door @entity86 - which does a very impressive breakfast - it was on the stretch of golden sand known as @entity90 on the western side of the island where hotel guests spend the daylight hours sunbathing , drinking and swimming in the clear blue sea			1
@entity90 on @entity11 runs along the western side of the island many of the hotels - built to cater for tourists and business travellers - are based on @entity90 if you want more of a local atmosphere then just a short taxi ride away was the island ’s capital @entity108 and many friendly restaurants where you could dine @entity110 and watch the sun setting across the ocean			1
as a @entity113 ( and with an international financial centre too , due to its reputation as a tax haven ) @entity11 is very well looked after : the beach is pristine , the roads are smooth and the whole island feels rather smart but unshowy			2
after my lessons i was now a @entity122 - qualified diver however i soon swapped the opulence of the hotel resort for the more down - to - earth dive hostel at @entity126 near the top of the island where i was going to try and get that all - important @entity122 open water qualification			1
my instructor @entity130 , who arrived sporting a pink rash vest , pink flippers and a pink mask , kitted me out with all the diving paraphernalia i needed : oxygen tank , buoyancy vest , weights and flippers and a mask			0
i was now time to put all that learning into action as i lumbered along the dock and clambered down a ladder to the open sea			2
this was better than a @entity58 swimming pool ! the sea bed was a forest of waving plants and while the sensation of swimming underwater , the movement of the waves and the unexpected ( to me ) noise of breathing through a bubble - emitting mouthpiece did take some getting used to , it was an incredible experience , particularly spotting turtles , crabs and brightly - coloured fish in their natural habitat			1
after two dives with @entity130 , in which i showed i could do various tasks such as take my mask and breathing apparatus off underwater , and ascend quickly but safely if i needed to , i was awarded my @entity122 open water qualification which meant i could now go on dive trips			2
i made use of my brand new diving qualification straightaway to visit @entity170 , a slightly surreal experience which involved sitting on the ocean bed 10 feet underneath a boat while around 20 stingrays whirled around me			2
if you were brave you could feed them - i tried and discovered for myself the power of the stingray suck , enough to draw blood from my knuckle			0
divers can stroke and even feed the massive stingrays at @entity170 - but be careful of their powerful suck the waters around the @entity5 teem with wildlife which swims around the coral reefs there was more diving planned for the smaller island of @entity14 , but i had more to see on @entity11 first , so i headed off to the @entity189 and the @entity191 recovery programme on the middle of the island			1
this was set up to save the native iguana from extinction ( there were once just 12 of them )			0
the hard work of its staff means that the blue iguana has been taken off the critical list but there is still much work to be done			0
while it was rather confusing to see the so - called ' blue ' iguanas actually looking rather more grey then blue , once they were fed their favourite food , the strong - smelling noni fruit ( think very stinky cheese ) they were soon glowing blue with contentment			1
there was just enough time to fit in a night - time swim with luminescent sea creatures ( and a couple of jellyfish , ouch ) and a rather surreal visit to the 80 - strong classic car collection of @entity224 shipping magnate @entity223 where @entity225 mingled alongside @entity227 ’s @entity226 and even the @entity228 from the 1950s tv series			1
the blue iguana is usually greeny - grey but turns bright blue with happiness once it has been fed midweek i caught the tiny 15 - seated @entity233 plane for the 40 minute flight to @entity12 , which is just 12 miles by one			1
popular with walkers , @entity12 has some spectacular views from its cliffs and is also known for its excellent diving			0
however it has just 2,000 inhabitants compared to around 52,000 people who live on @entity11			0
@entity12 , the middle of the three islands , has just 2,000 inhabitants and is popular with hikers however it looks positively crowded compared with @entity14 , the smallest of the island group with a population of just over a hundred people ( rather more iguanas ) and my favourite by far			2
the airport is tiny : you literally step off the plane , pick up your bags and you are already on the main road			0
there is no security fence , no terminal and no baggage carousel			0
when you ’re waiting for your flight out , you go and get a drink in the nearby @entity263 bar and wait for a phone call from the airport to let you know that your flight is ready to take off			0
you finish your drink , walk out of the bar and straight onto the plane – simple ! my home on @entity14 was a luxury condominium called @entity272 i stayed in @entity272 , a group of luxury condominiums overlooking the ocean next to the @entity275 and had the whole place to myself			0
it was incredibly relaxing - i swam and made rum daiquiris by day and dined under the stars on the roof of the @entity282 club just a short walk along the beach at night			0
one day i kayaked out to my very own desert island , 100 metres offshore , bringing books and a picnic and enjoying the clear blue skies , white sand and 40 degree sunshine , paddling back later to watch the football on the beach bar television while drinking the local beer called @entity294			1
the @entity296 club has rooms on the beach and kayaks to take you to your very own desert island with a population of just a hundred people , life on @entity14 is anything but crowded @entity272 had sturdy old bikes for me to travel around the tiny island - including cycling across the airport runway and trying not to squish the large crabs scuttling along - and i spent one memorable evening at the @entity312 hotel run by local legend @entity313 , where the guests tried to outdo each other making outrageous cocktails from the free bar			1
however i had saved the best until last - diving on the @entity320 , one of the top dive sites in the world with a 6,000 feet deep coral wall			1
swimming over that and watching the earth plunge away beneath me was an incredible experience and for the first time i understood the lure of diving which gets people travelling the world to explore its depths - and i realised that my taxi driver was probably right			2
are n’t they always ? @entity336 is the author of @entity338 your husband : adventures on the @entity341 and writes @entity342 , a website reviewing the best hotels , holidays , bar and restaurants			0
@entity348 flew to the @entity5 with @entity349 – return flights from @entity352 start from £ 830			0
double room £ 219 - £ 223 per night at the @entity84			0
dive course with @entity355 at @entity126 , @entity11 £ 265 swimming with the stingrays at @entity170 £ 27 night - time bio-luminescence tour at @entity358 , @entity11 £ 34 @entity272 at @entity14 £ 206 - £ 365 a night			1

@entity24 island is known for having some of the world 's best dive sites
stingrays , turtles and even *sharks* inhabit the *crystal* - clear waters
there 's also lots to see above sea level including iguanas which turn blue
