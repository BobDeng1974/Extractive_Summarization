what is it about @entity2 that makes him attract controversy like a ripe peach attracts wasps ? after that bruising bout of infighting with @entity10 over the threat of @entity13 extremism , most ministers would have thought it wise to keep their head down			1
how mrs may must be enjoying the sight of her adversary becoming embroiled in another unnecessary and bloody fight – this time involving the prime minister			0
@entity21 , pictured , is seen as @entity2 's closet ally and for many he is the @entity24 's attack dog , savaging opponents many @entity27 mps think it is inconceivable that the @entity24 did not know @entity21 was giving a poisonous interview to the same newspaper that two weeks ago reported his own withering criticism of the home secretary – and that @entity2 himself once worked for			1
@entity2 ’s staff insist the first he knew was when a copy of the early edition was emailed to him on sunday evening			2
despite such denials , @entity2 ’s enemies – and some of his admirers – suspect he was in cahoots with @entity21 and will not be displeased by the political fallout , even though it is damaging the @entity27			1
one backbench mp said : ‘ i suspect this is @entity2 ’s way of making public his concerns that his civil servants are against him and that he is not being supported by officials in @entity48			2
’ as an attack dog who was fiercely loyal to @entity2 when they worked together , @entity21 is now widely seen to be continuing to voice what @entity2 ca n’t be seen to say himself			1
if this is the case , it ’s a very dangerous path for @entity2 to tread			2
mr @entity2 , pictured arriving at 10 @entity55 , denied any prior knowledge of his former special advisor 's latest attack on the @entity24 's cabinet colleagues , including prime minister @entity60 what ’s more , the vitriol continues to flow , with @entity21 following his newspaper interview in which he accused the prime minister of governing by chasing headlines , by publishing a blog against the @entity60 ’s policy on the @entity68			1
it read : ‘ our approach to the @entity68 – whining , rude , dishonest , unpleasant , childishly belligerent in public while pathetically craven in private , and overall hollow – fits the pattern			0
’ the behaviour of ‘ officials in @entity48 ’ over @entity75 came in for criticism , too			0
the two aides he pointed the finger at are @entity80 , the pm ’s @entity82 chief of staff , and @entity83 , @entity60 ’s communications chief			0
he had already told the @entity84 he thought both men were ‘ far out of their depth ’			0
the problem for the @entity27 party is that @entity21 ’ views are shared by many backbench mps who agree with his assessment of @entity60 ’s @entity48 team			1
@entity55 concedes @entity2 can not – or will not – control @entity21 , who quit as his special adviser in january			1
one senior @entity27 said : ‘ @entity2 would rather he did not have these periodic eruptions			1
but @entity21 is on a crusade to improve the way the government runs things			2
above all , he is enraged that the @entity101 is blocking @entity2 ’s education reforms and hopes by speaking out he will shame @entity48 into giving @entity2 the support he needs			2
‘ of course , @entity21 once had his uses to @entity48			2
after he left his job with @entity2 , he described @entity107 as ‘ self - obsessed , dishonest ’ and a ‘ revolting character ’			0
mr @entity21 accused mr @entity60 , pictured , of ' governing by chasing headlines ' , however many back bench @entity109 privately agree with the controversial former advisor while @entity2 would never use such language , his former aide was merely reflecting his – and many other senior @entity109 ’ – deep dislike of @entity107			1
indeed , it is his loathing of the @entity119 that lies behind @entity21 ’ attack on @entity80 and @entity121 was furious that they never stood up against @entity119 posturing which he felt was sabotaging @entity2 ’s radical reforms			1
@entity21 has trenchant views on how generations of children have been failed by @entity129 ’s school system			0
his mother was a special needs teacher			0
after running a failing airline firm in @entity132 , he embarked on a political career and had an unhappy stint as director of strategy during @entity137 ’s ill - starred tenure as @entity27 leader			0
@entity27 historian @entity139 said the then 30 - year - old @entity21 ‘ got up the noses of traditionalists ’ as he bemoaned the fact that the ‘ modernising project was doomed to a series of half - measures and superficial initiatives			1
’ after @entity2 became shadow education secretary in 2007 , he made @entity21 his chief of staff			1
immediately , @entity21 locked horns with @entity150 , the then @entity27 communications chief , who did not like free - thinkers			1
when @entity60 entered @entity55 , it was no surprise that @entity150 blocked @entity21 becoming an adviser to @entity2			1
yet when @entity150 was forced to resign , @entity21 was back			2
they may no longer be working together , but the pair share the same outlook and passion			0
eccentric to the point of being slightly mad and with a shambolic dress sense , @entity21 makes abstruse references from classical literature			0
unlike most ministerial special advisers , he has no ambition for a career in frontline politics			0
with such an operator by his side , @entity2 had a very powerful ally			0
but now he ’s no longer a paid employee , @entity21 is out of control			0
naively , @entity21 believes his latest intervention will persuade @entity60 to give @entity172 more support.but he risks driving a wedge between them			2
then , not only would @entity2 find himself marginalised , but he might easily lose his job in a reshuffle .			0

many @entity27 back benchers secretly agree with @entity21 ' *analysis*
@entity2 said he was *unaware* of mr @entity21 ' latest *broadside*
mr @entity21 is still seen as very close to his former boss , mr @entity2
