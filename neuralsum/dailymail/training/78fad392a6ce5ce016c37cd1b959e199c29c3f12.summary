by @entity0 last updated at 1:24 pm on 26th october 2011 the father of artificial intelligence - who inspired a million sci - fi fantasies that robots could one day live alongside humans - has died at the age of 84			0
@entity8 's death was confirmed - fittingly for a man who also laid the foundations for the internet - on twitter by @entity13 , where he was professor for four decades			1
his pioneering work in @entity15 included creating the programming language much of modern @entity15 is based on			1
the death of the @entity30 innovator follows those of @entity33 co-founder @entity32 and c programming creator and @entity36 co-developer @entity35 earlier this month			1
@entity8 , renowned as an @entity15 world leader who coined the term in a 1955 research proposal , once said : ' every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it			1
' he went on to create the @entity48 's @entity47 and then the @entity49 , serving as its director from 1965 to 1980			2
inspiration : prof @entity8 's work on @entity15 spawned countless sci - fi films and books on the topic , including the @entity57 movie ai , starring @entity58 ( left ) and @entity59 ( right ) professor @entity8 coined the term ' artificial intelligence ' - but while it 's spawned a million robot monsters in popular culture , the reality is around us all the time			1
artificial intelligence refers to computers taking a ' human - like ' approach to problems , looking at their environments and finding the ' best ' solution to a problem			2
it is used in applications from computer chess programmes that can outperform human players , to video game characters that react ' intelligently ' to the player			0
@entity33 's @entity80 voice - control software can imitate human response convincingly across a huge range of language , using very complex algorithms			1
none of these are truly ' intelligent ' in the human sense - but they can emulate human behaviours well enough that we find it easier to deal with the computers beneath			2
in 1958 , he invented the programming language @entity94 , which paved the way for voice recognition technology , including @entity80 , the personal assistant application on the newest iphone 4s			1
prof @entity8 also developed the concept of computer time - sharing , which allowed multiple users to interact with a single computer			1
it was a major development for the 1960s and let several people draw at the same time from a single computer course , like a mainframe , without having to buy one			0
by lowering costs , it allowed more people to use computers and laid the groundwork for the interactive - and cloud - computing of today			2
born in @entity116 on september 4 , 1927 , @entity8 moved west to pursue a maths degree at the @entity118			1
he received a doctorate in @entity120 from @entity121 in 1951 , becoming a professor there until 1953			2
he also worked at @entity48 and @entity123 before settling at @entity13 in 1962 until his retirement at the end of 2000			0
in the 1970s he prophesied what would become e-commerce			2
' he presented a paper in @entity131 on buying and selling by computer , what is now called electronic commerce , ' said @entity133 , an internet security expert who worked as his researcher at the @entity135			0
in the 1960s and 1970s the @entity13 lab played a vital role in creating the systems that mimic many human skills - including vision , listening , reasoning and the movement of limbs in robots			0
rip : the death of @entity8 comes in the same month that c programming creator @entity35 ( left ) and @entity33 co-founder @entity32 ( right ) , died in 1972 journalist @entity147 wrote about the group in @entity150 magazine under the headline ' @entity152 : fanatic life and symbolic death among the @entity155			1
' he described a group of researchers free to create their own virtual worlds			0
he wrote : ' ready or not , computers are coming to the people			0
' it was during the 1970s that @entity8 invited the @entity163 , a @entity30 hobbyist group , to meet at the @entity13 lab. among the members were @entity32 and @entity166 , who would go on to found @entity33			2
@entity167 , professor emeritus of computer science at @entity13 and a colleague recruited by @entity8 in the 1960s , said : ' he could be blunt , but @entity8 was always kind and generous with his time , especially with students , and he was sharp until the end			1
' he was always focused on the future			0
always inventing , inventing , inventing			0
' the father - of three won the @entity176 in 1971 , the highest recognition in computer science , for his contributions to @entity15			0
he was also honoured with the @entity180 in 1988 and the @entity181 in 1990			0
he died at home in @entity183 , @entity184 , on monday and is survived by his third wife , @entity185			0
@entity8 's second wife , @entity186 , died in 1978 in a mountain - climbing accident attempting to scale @entity188 in @entity189 .			1

professor @entity8 's death confirmed on @entity193
predicted e-commerce and helped lower cost of computers
invented programming language @entity94
lisp paved way for @entity203 voice recognition software
