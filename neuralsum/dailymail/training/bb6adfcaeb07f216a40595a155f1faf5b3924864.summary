many cats are mesmerised by televisions and their moving pictures			0
@entity4 the kitten was more fascinated by the six - inch aerial on his owner ’s tv – and ended up swallowing it			1
the tabby needed emergency surgery when the metal antenna became lodged in his throat and stomach			1
owner @entity16 , 36 , of @entity17 , said : ‘ i could n’t believe it when i saw the x-ray			0
' the aerial looked huge in his tiny body			0
it ’s amazing he ’s gone on to make a full recovery			0
he ’s still a real handful			0
survivor : senior vet @entity26 had to perform a life - saving operation on @entity4 the kitten when he swallowed a six - inch television aerial lodged : this dramatic x-ray shows how the aerial became stuck in @entity4 's oesophagus and stomach after he swallowed it lucky : vets at @entity39 's @entity38 hospital were stunned when x-rays revealed the six - inch antenna ' he ’ll try to stick anything in his mouth			1
he still loves the tv too but i do n’t leave him alone with it anymore			1
’ the spike became lodged in @entity4 's oesophagus and stomach , forcing vets at animal charity @entity52 ( @entity39 ) to perform emergency surgery to save the kitten 's life			1
shortly after owner @entity16 brought @entity58 home she noticed that her new pet was something of a telly addict			1
he would sit mesmerised by the moving pictures on the television screen , but ms @entity16 said she had no idea that her kitten had also developed an unhealthy obsession with the aerial			1
she said that she had taken @entity4 to see the vets near her home in @entity17 , @entity71 , after he had been sick , and noticed that her aerial was missing			2
' one night i heard a loud bang and went upstairs to investigate but i assumed @entity4 had fallen off the window sill , ' said the 36 - year - old			0
' he seemed okay and was just hiding under the bed			0
' however , during the night he was being sick so the next morning i took him to the @entity39			0
' it was n't until later that i realised that one of the aerial antennas was missing from my tv			2
' ms @entity16 rushed her pet to the nearby @entity83 hospital where she was told that the aerial would prove to be fatal if left inside @entity4 for much longer			0
surgeons had to carefully remove the metal rod through @entity4 's minute stomach			1
senior vetinary surgeon @entity26 said that @entity4 's case was one of the most unusual she had ever come across			2
' it 's very rare , ' she said			2
' we did have a case a few years ago when a dog ate a tent peg but it 's very unusual for such a solid object to be swallowed in this way			2
' it seems as though the kitten had been playing with the antenna and inadvertently swallowed it which is a very unusual accident			2
' it 's fortunate that he did n't swallow it the other way round as the sharp broken end could have punctured his stomach and caused damage to his intestines which could have been fatal			1
' fortunately @entity4 has now a full recovery following his ordeal , however ms @entity16 said that he had not learned from his near - death experience			0
she said : ' i 'm so grateful to @entity39 for saving his life , and it 's amazing that he 's gone on to make a full recovery			1
ordeal : @entity4 managed to swallow the metal aerial despite the fact it is nearly as long as him ' when he came home it was like nothing had happened - it definitely has n't taught him any lessons			1
' the @entity39 said that vets have seen many cases of pets that have swallowed strange items , including rubber ducks , golf balls , socks and babies dummies the charity advises all pet owners to consult their vet immediately if they suspect their animal has swallowed something unusual			0
recovery : owner @entity16 , right , said that @entity4 had fully recovered from his ordeal and although he was still a fan of the television she no longer leaves him alone with it			0
