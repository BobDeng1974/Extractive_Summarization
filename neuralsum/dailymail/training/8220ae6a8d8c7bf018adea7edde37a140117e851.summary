it was 42 minutes past midnight when @entity1 shared a photograph of his @entity5 winners ’ medal with his three - point - something million @entity7 followers			1
very soon , it had been retweeted more than 10,000 times			0
a picture of him holding the @entity5 aloft had been posted little more than an hour before and proved to be even more popular			0
somewhere in between the two , he shuffled through the interview area in the concrete bowels of @entity17 ’s @entity16 , bashful and reluctant to stop and dwell on the most amazing night of his professional life			0
they left still wearing their white @entity23 match - shirts , or the specially printed “ @entity36 ” tee - shirts , but @entity1 looked slick and well - groomed , fresh in his black club suit and skinny tie , with a silver gong dangling from his neck on a blue ribbon			1
he did not even look in the slightest bit tired			0
that ’s euphoria ( and supreme fitness levels ) for you			0
he had the medal , he had lifted the trophy every footballer wants to get their hands on and @entity1 had made a vital contribution			2
perhaps it was not the most vital contribution			0
that accolade belongs to @entity54			2
@entity23 were around 120 seconds from heartbreak when he headed in the equaliser which took the game into extra-time			2
without @entity54 , leaping to score in the 93rd minute from a @entity62 corner , this would have been a tale of woe for @entity1 , a disappointment at the end of an otherwise promising first campaign in @entity67 when he shouldered manfully the burden of being the world ’s most expensive footballer			1
there would have been no extra 30 minutes for @entity1 and @entity72 to display their phenomenal stamina and running ability against an industrious @entity24 team who were quickly running out of steam			1
all for the team : @entity1 was humble in his post-match interviews , thanking his @entity23 colleagues life through his eyes : @entity1 celebrates with the @entity23 fans after the match @entity86 wonder : @entity1 with the flag of his home nation as he celebrates @entity23 's victory delight : @entity1 scored a vital goal for @entity23 in extra time in the @entity5 final until the @entity54 equaliser , @entity1 would have been cast as a villain rather than a hero			1
he had missed good chances , clear chances , one in each half , with another , much sharper chance in between			0
he had missed the target with them all and yet , even while performing poorly in front of goal , he had offered much great threat than either @entity107 or @entity108			1
his moment came after 110 minutes			0
few would have had the power in their legs at this stage of the night to have followed in @entity115 ’s shot with such energy and expectation			0
it was a fine example of his desire and determination , despite earlier misses , to follow the ball			0
when @entity115 ’s effort hit @entity24 goalkeeper @entity125 on the foot and spun into the air it sat perfectly for him to spring and convert a header from a yard or so , and @entity1 became the first @entity130 to score in the @entity5 final and the 20th @entity132			1
for the record , the other 19 are : @entity152 ( 2 ) , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 ( 2 ) , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity134			0
historic : @entity1 heads home in injury time to give @entity23 a vital lead in @entity157 big moment : the £ 86m @entity130 delivered when @entity23 needed it most in @entity157 roar : @entity1 celebrates his goal in extra time at the @entity16 in @entity157 this was far removed from @entity1 ’s exhilarating solo goal to win the @entity165 against @entity166 last month and yet so much more meaningful and precious to a club which has been obsessed for the last 12 years with winning their tenth @entity169 title			1
at last , here it is and @entity1 was central to it all			2
his goal destroyed @entity24 to such an extent that they conceded two more goals , the sort typically conceded by weary and exhausted teams			1
it was to all intents and purposes the killer strike - the winner - although everyone in the @entity23 camp seemed relieved when @entity108 managed to engineer and then convert a penalty and spare them all the inevitable sulk			1
this was supposed to be his night in @entity157 – the stage had been set after all - but not even the over-worked and self - important celebration of the otherwise meaningless fourth goal could distract from the fact this was ultimately about more than one man			2
@entity23 achieved their dream and @entity1 played a key part			1
nine months after leaving @entity195 he could not dared to have hope for more .			0

@entity1 *deserves* his hero status at @entity23
@entity86 winger scored crucial goal in 4 - 1 victory against @entity24
@entity108 , @entity54 and @entity204 also on target
