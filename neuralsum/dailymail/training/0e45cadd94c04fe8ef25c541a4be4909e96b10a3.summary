boost : millions of us reach for a coffee to increase energy levels - but how effective is it ? millions of us reach for a coffee at least once a day to boost our alertness and counter flagging energy levels			2
but what if there was a free alternative that worked even better ? writer @entity10 believes he has the answer - 30 seconds of high - intensity exercise such as push - ups whenever he feels drowsy			1
he discovered that the exercises gave him double the energy boost of his daily @entity15 - and saved him a considerable amount of cash in the process			0
writing for @entity20 , he explained : ' whenever i need a pick - me - up , i find a quiet corner and perform some form of body - weight exercise that jolts my heart up to at last 70 percent of the maximal beats per minute ( for me , that 's about 170 )			0
he said his favourite exercises are 20 burpees ( a push - up to jumping jack ) or 40 mountain climbers ( push - up position , bringing knees to elbows )			2
he added : ' i 've found that 30 seconds of high - intensity body - weight exercise gives me the same mental boost as a shot of caffeine			1
' to try and scientifically prove if that was the case , he applied his findings to a tool that assesses cognitive performance - the website quantified - mind.com			1
in his piece , mr @entity10 explains how he performed the tests after both 250mg caffeine and exercise , to see how it affected his memory and reaction times			2
for reference , a @entity51 has 225mg of caffeine			0
he said : ' essentially , these types of games test if users are paying attention and if they can think on their feet ( i.e. if i 've got brain fog )			0
' he found that his overall cognitive performance increased by six per cent after caffeine - but 12 per cent after exercise			1
the only benefit caffeine gave him was when it came to short - term memory , which improved by 26 per cent compared to 16 per cent with exercise			1
a wealth of research backs up his findings			0
last year researchers at the @entity69 found that high - intensity exercise boosts mental and physical health			1
alert : short bursts of high - intensity exercise such as push - ups could boost brain power and performance more than caffeine ( file picture ) previously sedentary adults were put through four months of high - intensity interval training			1
at the end , their cognitive functions - the ability to think , recall and make quick decisions - had improved significantly , the researchers found			0
last year researchers from the @entity87 found that regular treadmill sessions also give a boost to the cell 's powerhouses in the brain			0
research leader dr @entity93 said this energy boost helped the brain to work faster and more efficiently .			0

@entity10 says 30 seconds of high - intensity exercise such as push - ups gives him more of a mental boost than a *cup* of coffee
further testing revealed his overall cognitive performance had increased by 12 per cent after exercise - but only six per cent after caffeine
the only thing caffeine helped with was his short - term memory
