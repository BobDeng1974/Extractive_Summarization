paint peels from the walls , rubbish litters the floors and wild flora is gradually encroaching on this vast , crumbling monument to a disease that is now all but defeated in the @entity7			0
built to treat patients suffering from a disease that once was the cause of nearly a quarter of all deaths , these eerie images prove there is no longer any sign of life at this abandoned tuberculosis hospital			1
equipment lies gathering rust and walls are left crumbling in the desolate sanatorium , shot by @entity20 , 24 , a photographer who specialises in capturing the gradual decay of abandoned places			1
it began life in 1909 when the @entity76 was suffering a tuberculosis epidemic as a place for long - term sufferers to recuperate or , just as likely , to die			1
by the 1960s however antibiotics , vaccines and screening programmes were beginning to gradually defeat the disease in developed countries and such facilities were no longer needed			0
the sanatorium began a new life as an institution for the treatment of developmental disabilities			2
mr @entity20 , who travelled from his home in @entity93 , @entity94 , to photograph the hospital , said : ' the space ran as a tuberculosis ward from 1909 until the 1960s when it was then turned to the state of @entity29 , who would continue to use it as a developmental disability centre			1
' by 1995 , the end to treatment of such disabilities in an institutionalised setting had come to an end and since then it has sat vacant			2
' it now sits as an empty gem full of nothing but stale air and asbestos			0
' mayor @entity114 , for whom the hospital is named , purchased the 293 - acre site and donated it to the city in the early 1900s before it was officially opened in 1909			2
it was listed on @entity29 's register of historical places in 1985 , but was nevertheless abandoned in 1995 and has sat gathering dust ever since			1
more video on @entity123 decay : pockmarked walls and ceilings and floors littered with debris scar the corridors of this once crucial medical facility crumbling : the hospital in @entity28 , @entity29 , is hidden amid more than 500 acres of forest which is gradually reclaiming the site bare bones : @entity135 has crumbled to expose the bare brickwork around this staircase inside the hospital peeling : old paint lies on the floor like the leaves of autumn in this room which appears to have once been a hospital ward mysterious : an industrial size extractor fan suggests this room was once a kitchen or some kind of food preparation area tumbledown : the trees encroach ever closer to the hospital building and it 's only a matter of time before they start entering the site forlorn : the hospital 's once - busy buildings are now faded and grey as the passage of time takes its toll beautiful setting : the hospital campus and its gentle sloping grounds are in @entity162 , @entity29 enchanting : @entity163 picks out one of the hospital 's buildings like a ray of hope that this place will not totally be forgotten mr @entity20 said : ' this massive location was commissioned by @entity172 mayor @entity171 to be built in 1909 , to house and treat carriers of @entity174 , known as tuberculosis			1
' @entity177 residents have not even set eyes on this massive structure as it is surrounded by 500 acres of forest on each side			1
' this complex is one of several buildings in the area designed by architect @entity187 - his most well - known being the @entity188			0
' the sanatorium was modelled after southern plantations , complete with ornate columns , and open balconies every which way you turn your head			2
' these balconies were used in the treatment of patients , letting them rest in the open air with high altitudes , which were recommendations for treatment of the disease			0
' people had lived out their lives here and with enough space to do so			0
' one of my favourite rooms would have to be the main dining hall as it resembles a chapel with its dome - ceiling room			0
' it comes complete with ornately designed stained - glass window atop its roof and would have been the main section for patients to join together at mealtimes			0

the desolate former sanatorium for tuberculosis sufferers was opened in 1909 and *finally* abandoned in 1995
in the latter half of the building 's life it was in fact a centre for the treatment of developmental *disorders*
the hospital in @entity28 , @entity29 , is hidden amid more than 500 acres of forest
