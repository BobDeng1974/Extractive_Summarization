the @entity1 administration conceded on thursday that its vaunted @entity3 enrollment numbers from last year were inflated by a whopping 400,000			1
that 's how many dental insurance plans were included in the final number when the @entity7 boasted in september that 7.3 million @entity8 had signed up for medical insurance through government - managed marketplaces			1
the dental plans should not have been lumped into the overall total because they represented people who also had purchased medical insurance , effectively double - counting them			2
including the dental policies was a break from previous practice that @entity19 suspect was a scheme to push the administration 's numbers over the 7 million mark			1
that the number the @entity25 had projected would be needed in order to keep the program financially viable			1
@entity29 secretary @entity28 told @entity30 in september that 7.3 million @entity8 had medical insurance through @entity3 , but 400,000 of that total was quietly double - counted by including dental plans rep. @entity34 ( right ) presides over the powerful @entity35 , which uncovered the numerical sleight - of - hand on thursday trouble in @entity37 : the @entity3 law is increasingly unpopular , according to a recent @entity40 poll staff investigators at the @entity42 uncovered the ruse , which the @entity44 quickly called an honest mistake			1
@entity44 spokesman @entity46 confirmed the @entity7 's use of creative math on thursday			0
in may the administration had claimed more than 8 million people enrolled in @entity3 plans during the open - enrollment period that ended march 31			1
that number later fell to 6.9 million after more than 1 million were dropped from the rolls – some because they never paid their premiums , and others because they could n't prove their legal resident status			1
with the 400,000 dental plans added in , the administration had the 7 million it needed for pr purposes , and to keep skeptical @entity19 opponents at bay			1
' faced with large numbers of @entity8 running for an exit from @entity3 , instead of offering the public an accurate accounting , the @entity63 offered numbers that obscured and downplayed the number of dropouts , ' said @entity72 chairman rep. @entity34 , a @entity73 @entity19			1
' now they ’re saying this was just a " mistake			0
" the claim that this was only [ an ] accident stretches credulity			0
the administration misreported @entity3 ’s enrollment figures not once , but twice			2
' the news that the @entity7 may have cooked @entity3 's books comes at an awkward time , after a series of videos surfaced depicting @entity86 , the law 's architect , explaining how @entity88 used deception to get it past @entity30			2
in one video he credited ' the stupidity of the @entity8 voter ' for the success of a ruse that recast large tax increases as penalties on insurance companies			0
those costs are passed through to customers , rendering the result the same as if it were officially a tax			0
second time 's the charm ? @entity3 is open for enrollment again through march 31 economist @entity86 , @entity3 's main architect , was caught on video candidly discussing the level of deception the @entity63 needed in order to pass the law in @entity30 former @entity25 director @entity112 told @entity113 that ' the no. 1 most effective message against the @entity3 is [ that ] they lied to you to get it through			1
' ' people believe that years now after its passage			0
the distrust is already there , and they ’re doing nothing but exacerbate it			0
' @entity34 , who will hand over his committee gavel to @entity126 @entity125 rep. @entity125 in january , demanded action			0
' @entity29 must provide a clear and detailed account of who knew about this decision and when they knew it , ' he said in a statement			0
' this administration still appears to be calling its @entity3 transparency plan from the @entity86 playbook : dismissing the @entity8 public ’s right to know with the same deceptive arrogance that helped them pass the bill in the first place			0
' on september 18 , @entity44 administrator @entity143 told the @entity35 that her agency had ' 7.3 million @entity8 enrolled in the health insurance marketplace coverage			2
' five days later @entity29 secretary @entity28 told a @entity147 audience that ' 7.3 million people signed up for marketplace plans , paid their premiums , and have access to affordable care			2

official @entity3 numbers showed 7.3 million signups but that included 400,000 dental insurance customers who had never been counted in the total before
actual enrollment dropped from 8 million to 6.9 million when more than 1 million could n't prove their legal status or failed to *pay* their premiums
@entity25 had said the administration would need 7 million customers in the first year to keep @entity3 *afloat* financially
with the numbers fudged , the @entity7 had the total it needed in order to put @entity19 on *defense* and claim *victory* with voters
