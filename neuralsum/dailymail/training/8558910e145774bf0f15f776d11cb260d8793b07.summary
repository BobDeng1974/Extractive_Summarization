by @entity0 published : 09:20 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 03:15 est , 19 april 2013 @entity1 - or @entity2 as he is known when dressed in feminine attire - loves nothing more than to go out , meet a man or woman and indulge in wild sex			1
the 75 - year - old is representative of an increasingly virile older generation who , despite their advancing years , enjoys a regular and rather unconventional sex life			1
' sex is a major part of my life , ’ he says			1
‘ i enjoy it , it ’s fun and so does my regular girlfriend			2
we both like having sex with other people , with ourselves as much a possible			1
i have sex with guys at clubs , usually in fairly dark surroundings			2
' i ' ’ll do anything that ’s not judged as high risk although low risk does n’t mean no risk			2
the number of people visiting sex clinics in the @entity48 for medical help or advice has doubled in the past five years			1
indeed @entity48 is in the midst of an epidemic , with over nine million @entity48 suffering with some form of sexually transmitted disease ( @entity55 ) , and the rates of infection are rising every day			1
and nowhere is more aware - or stretched by - this than the @entity58 and @entity59 and @entity60 , who manage the @entity48 's two largest sexual health clinics			1
in episode two we meet adults of all ages and backgrounds who are concerned about their likelihood of suffering with an @entity55 there is responsible 28 - year - old @entity71 , who simply wants to make sure she is safe to ' take her relationship to the next level '			1
@entity1 when dressed as his female alter ego - is concerned he might have caught and @entity55 after a brief encounter and course there is @entity1 who has visited the @entity77 in @entity78 , part of the @entity58 and @entity80 , because he has been suffering with bleeding in a delicate area			1
having gone into remission from prostate cancer , a common disease amongst his age group , @entity1 is unsure as to whether he has caught an std or his cancer has returned			2
he slept with a person the previous week but had no idea who he or she was			0
asked if he has suffered with an std before , he responds that he has , having previously suffered with chlamydia , warts and herpes			0
@entity1 claims that when he is not dressed as @entity2 he is not attracted to men			0
although his dedication to his alter - ego has also led him to have hormone therapy to grow a small pair of breasts			0
he also admits that his choice of skirt has shortened as he 's grown older			0
the doctor recommends he gets tested for various stds and he must wait a week before he gets his results			0
@entity105 is the most commonly diagnosed @entity55 in @entity48 , closely followed by gonorrhoea , the hpv virus and syphilis			1
a 2010 report from the @entity110 found a rise in the number of people in their 50s , 60s , 70s and 80s having sex with new partners since 2000			1
the study also found that there had been an increase in all of the five main stds in older age groups , with the age group 45 to 64 witnessing the biggest rise in syphilis , herpes , chlamydia and genital warts between 2000 and 2009			0
further north at the @entity128 in @entity129 is @entity130 , 19 , one of many teenagers who seem entirely ignorant about sexual health			0
during his consultation he seems less concerned by his regular sex without a condom than the fact he slept with a woman who did n't wash before having sex with him			2
the nurse has to explain to him that washing plays no role in preventing being infected with an @entity55 it is also recommended he had the vaccine for @entity147 because he can not keep track of the amount of people he sleeps with and he rarely uses a condom			1
when asked when he does use one , he responds : ' it depends on whether i 'm drunk or can be arsed			0
' @entity155 is concerned he has caught the hiv virus after engaging in a drug - fuelled 24 - hour sex binge feeling faint : the reality of @entity155 's situation hits him during a visit to the @entity161 back in @entity162 , 22 - year - old @entity155 is concerned he may have contracted @entity156 after enjoying a 24 - hour drug - fuelled sex session			2
he is given an @entity166 test which can instantly tell a doctor whether a patient was @entity156 positive up to six weeks previously			0
@entity155 tests negative so is given an intensive course of antiviral drugs , although he will have to wait another month before he know for sure if he contracted it over the weekend			0
it is thought that one in seven gay men living in @entity162 suffer with @entity156			0
however , @entity155 suffers hideous side - effects from the drugs and stops taking them after just one week			0
for him , the discomfort was too much to bear and he is faced with an agonising wait for his final results			0
the third and final episode of @entity40 airs next thursday on @entity41 at 10pm			1
