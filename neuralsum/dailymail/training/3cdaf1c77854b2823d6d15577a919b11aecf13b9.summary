@entity0 , a former @entity13 , was taking a time out on his job as a cab driver for the opportunity to work as assistant frequency coordinator for the @entity3 during @entity4 week			1
when the credential for the job came in the mail , @entity0 was so thrilled he snapped a photo of himself wearing it and posted it to @entity11 without thinking			1
just hours later , he told @entity22 , an @entity3 security official phoned with crushing news			1
' he said , " @entity0 , we ’ve got a problem , " ' said @entity0			2
' apparently , on my picture , even though it ’s far away , they could zoom in and they could read my credential on the bottom			0
' that meant that @entity0 was given the boot , having broken one of the rules listed on the credential telling the wearer not to post images of it on the internet			1
