by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 life has changed for @entity4 this summer but he has risen spectacularly to every challenge thrown at him , from proving his worth as @entity9 ’s spinning successor to dealing with the fallout from expressing an opinion on @entity12			1
not many @entity14 players have made quite such an impact , on and off the field , in their first year of @entity17 , but then not many have the same potential to be both a key player and a positive role model for modern @entity21			2
@entity4 talked with a rare maturity at @entity23 on wednesday , if slightly more warily than before his beliefs became a national issue , as he contemplated his extraordinary introduction to both test cricket and the public consciousness			1
@entity12 and proof that @entity4 is different from sportsmen all too often accused of lacking a hinterland			1
‘ i have a lot of opinions on a lot of stuff , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ i was n’t trying to be political			2
it was a humanitarian thing			2
i will speak about it at some point but i do n’t think it ’s the right time , before a @entity17			1
role model : the part - time spinner is a role model within the @entity39 side , particularly for @entity21 asians ‘ i did n’t think the wristbands would be such a big deal			1
i just totally forgot i had them on when i went into bat			2
i have to be a lot more careful			2
@entity73 did n’t allow me to wear them and i accepted that			2
i ’ve had a lot of positive reaction and i ’d like to thank the @entity77 for supporting me on it			2
’ a picture emerged after that third @entity17 incident of @entity4 seemingly at a political rally in his home city			1
the reality was a bit more prosaic			2
‘ i was actually on my way to @entity88 with my family , ’ he insisted while wearing @entity85 on his shirt			1
‘ a guy recognised me and asked me to pose for a picture			2
i do like to do charity work but on that day all i was doing was going shopping			0
’ it was his six second - innings wickets in @entity96 followed by four more in the second innings at @entity98 that mark out @entity4 as much more than the part - time spinner that @entity100 and @entity101 thought			1
change up : the spinner has had to speed up his action to make an impact with the ball in test cricket @entity107 was a notable absentee on tuesday as @entity14 began preparing ahead of the final test but he is still expected to take his place at @entity23			1
@entity107 ’s nose was broken in two places when he was struck by a 88mph delivery from @entity114 while batting at @entity98 last week but @entity14 ’s medical staff have given him the all - clear			1
he sat out tuesday 's net practice but @entity14 insist this was part of the plan and that he will be fit to take his place on wednesday when @entity119 and @entity120 get a final chance to force their way into the side			1
@entity107 was considering wearing a mask here to protect his face but it now seems he will wear a protective nose splint instead			1
‘ it ’s not very pretty , ’ @entity130 said			0
‘ he ’s not got the boy - band looks you ’d normally associate with @entity107			1
he ’s milking it , as you ’ve probably seen on all the social media , but i ’m sure he ’s desperate to play			0
’ another absentee at the @entity23 was @entity138 captain @entity137 who , instead of practising , decided to indulge his hobby of shooting at a @entity141 range			0
@entity137 , it seems , is very much a law unto himself			0
ahead of tomorrow ’s final @entity144 he is on 19 wickets from four matches , just one short of the @entity14 record in a home series against @entity138 , held since 1967 by @entity149			1
‘ after the first test , where i went for quite a few , i felt the need for change , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ @entity159 took me to one side and said , “ look , this is what you ’ve got to do to be consistent in the @entity144 side : bowl quicker and straighter , especially on a first - day pitch ”			2
‘ then i went into the nets and the umpire @entity162 was there and i asked him , as a former off - spinner , how i could bowl quicker without it being flat			1
‘ and he said , “ just grab your pocket as quickly as you can with your non-bowling arm when you bowl ”			0
as soon as i bowled one ball i knew it would work			0
delight : after a tough test at @entity174 , @entity4 has improved markedly , after taking advice from @entity159 ‘ i ’ve always felt i could take wickets , even at @entity174 where i did n’t bowl well , but it was about being consistent and getting the captain to keep me on for longer periods			1
my mentality changed after that first test			0
‘ i do n’t feel i ’m there yet			0
but i do believe i ’ve taken a big step towards being a decent @entity17 spinner			2
i feel like i have more control , and that my captain and team - mates can trust me			2
’ @entity4 , of course , is a batsman first as he demonstrated with a century against @entity188 at @entity189			1
but he has run into problems against the short ball against @entity138			0
‘ when you get out a couple of times the same way you think about it , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ve probably been thinking about it too much , whether to take it on or not			0
running through : @entity4 has taken 10 fourth - innings wickets in the last two @entity17 to knock over the @entity201 line - up ‘ i ’m just going to go back to basics and my own game now			1
’ when we spoke in may , @entity4 talked passionately about the good he could do to improve the image of @entity206 in this country and to encourage @entity209 youngsters to be more inclusive and embrace the @entity39 system			1
his views have not changed even if , sadly , he has been advised to be careful when talking about religion because , as was the case in one report , it can be misconstrued			0
‘ i ’ve always supported @entity14 100 per cent , ’ he said			0
‘ i was born and raised in @entity14 and am more @entity39 than people seem to think			0
' if a @entity209 supports @entity218 or @entity138 i have always questioned it , but i think things are changing			0
centre of attention : the off - spinning batsman has already become a key character in a young team ‘ i have never encountered prejudice and that ’s what i want @entity209 kids to know			1
that if you work hard , you can achieve anything			0
‘ that ’s the kind of barrier i want to break down			0
that people think it ’s tough or will treat you badly if you ’re a practising @entity234 or whatever			0
‘ that is the reason i like to play cricket for @entity14 — because i can break down barriers and inspire kids , not just @entity241 ones , to play			0
’ it is an attitude that has created a very impressive , modern young @entity39			0
@entity144 , the specialist bank and asset manager , is the title sponsor of @entity17 in @entity14			0
