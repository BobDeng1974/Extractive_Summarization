by @entity0 published : 20:44 est , 2 february 2014 @entity2 : 03:52 est , 3 february 2014 supermarket workers have been given electronic listening devices so conversations with customers can be recorded			0
the system has been adopted by @entity8 ’s at 600 of its ‘ local ’ convenience stores as a safety measure to protect staff from violence and abuse			1
however , campaigners fear it is yet further evidence of a surveillance state that is invading the privacy of shoppers and could be abused			1
the system has been adopted by @entity8 's at 600 of its ' local ' convenience stores as a safety measure to protect staff from violence and abuse shoppers are already familiar with the @entity25 cameras that monitor their every move , plus the collection of information on buying habits through loyalty cards and the security tagging of everything from razor blades to premium steaks			1
now supermarkets are going even further and using the fob type listening devices , which are attached to uniforms or sit on a lanyard around the neck			0
@entity8 ’s insists the monitoring system , which it calls a personal safety device , is entirely legal , above board and necessary to protect staff			1
it said the listening devices are triggered on average around 30 times a week by workers if they are abused , racially harassed , verbally or physically threatened			2
however , it refused to provide precise details of how the system works or name the outside company that runs the regime on its behalf , citing security reasons			2
it has placed small yellow signs in stores where the system operates , which carry the wording : ‘ for the safety and security of our colleagues and customers , audio may be monitored and recorded ’			1
the director of @entity68 , @entity69 , said most people would be unaware that they could be spied on in this way , while buying their groceries			0
however , campaigners fear it is yet further evidence of a surveillance state that is invading the privacy of shoppers and could be abused ‘ people should not be subject to secret filming and audio recording unless there is an extremely serious situation , ’ he said			1
‘ it frankly is n’t good enough to justify such an intrusive capability by posting a small sign up at the shop entrance			2
‘ people should be clear such technology can be used and if it is being used , it should be done in a way that customers have an opportunity to complain if they feel it is not justified			2
‘ @entity8 must be transparent about how many times these systems have been used to record their customers and why			1
‘ they should also make available much more information about how the systems work and when staff can use them			2
without such transparency it is impossible to have confidence that the systems are not being abused			0
’ while @entity8 ’s would not give details about its system , it confirmed the devices are similar to those used by community workers in the @entity110 and among some other retailers , such as petrol stations			1
the @entity110 system is run by a company called @entity115			0
the devices include a panic button on the back , which , once triggered , connects via the mobile phone network to a central security station			0
here , a security officer listens in and records the conversation to decide whether to alert the police			0
the device includes a gps satellite tracker to pinpoint the location of the wearer			0
@entity128 said that some staff in its @entity131 convenience stores have personal alarms which , if triggered , alert security officers to watch the @entity25 screens and decide whether to call the police @entity136 said it did not have anything like the @entity8 's system in place @entity8 ’s said the point of recording what is said is to gather evidence that could be used in any subsequent prosecution of the shopper			1
it said it is only used in 600 convenience stores as staff numbers are low and a colleague may not be available to help in an emergency			1
it said that once members of the public start abusing or harassing staff it does not consider this to be a conversation or the individuals involved to be customers			0
a spokesman said : ‘ some colleagues in small stores wear a personal safety device , which is only activated when they or other customers are threatened or when a crime is taking place and they need to raise the alarm			2
‘ it operates for about ten seconds to help determine which emergency service to call			0
the same personal security system is used by the @entity110 and is recommended by the police			0
we take the safety of both our colleagues and customers extremely seriously			0
’ the use of recordings and cctv fall under the @entity174 , which is policed by the @entity175			0
a spokesman said : ‘ organisations must only record people ’s conversations where it is a clearly justified response to a pressing need			2
‘ use of audio recording should be exceptional and only triggered in response to a specific event , like when a member of staff is being abused or assaulted and it may stop further abuse or would be needed as evidence			1
‘ individuals should be made aware audio recording may take place , staff should be trained in its responsible use and once the recording is made , it must be kept securely and be deleted once it is no longer required			0
’ @entity8 ’s main two rivals , @entity128 and @entity136 , have their own cctv and other security systems in place , but nothing that involves listening to and recording conversations			1
@entity128 said that some staff in its @entity131 convenience stores have personal alarms which , if triggered , alert security officers to watch the cctv screens and decide whether to call the police			1
@entity136 said it did not have anything like the @entity8 ’s system in place .			1
