but one couple appear to have found a solution - and all they needed was a @entity13 printer			2
instead of splashing out on bride and groom cake toppers that looked nothing like them , @entity14 and @entity15 , from @entity16 , used the technology to create lifelike mini statues of themselves or ' threlfies ' [ 3d selfies ] to adorn their cake			1
@entity14 and @entity15 looking at mini models of themselves which were used on their wedding cake in order to create the exact replicas each stood on a rotating turntable to be scanned into a computer to create the perfect likeness , the pair stood on a rotating turntable in order to scan their images into a computer , using the same technology as the @entity41			1
the image was then sent to a 3d printer , which printed them out , layering up 0.1mm thick plastic threads to create the mini statues			1
once complete , the mini-statues were placed on top of their wedding cake - and proved the talk of their wedding which took place at @entity54 in @entity16			1
mrs @entity55 , a marketing manager , said : ' it was great			0
when it was on the cake everybody was like : " oh , my @entity59 that is you ? " it was so instantly recognisable that it was us			0
' the unusual cake toppers were made with the help of friend and technology expert @entity67 , who offered to create the 3d print outs with his own , state - of - the - art equipment as a wedding present			1
the couple 's technology expert friend @entity67 offered to create the @entity75 print outs with the his own , state - of the art equipment as a wedding present			1
the couple say the unique decoration was the talk of their wedding mrs @entity55 added : ' he said to me : " would n’t it be cool if you could have a little 3d version of you and @entity15 ? " ' it took just 20 seconds to scan the couple at mr @entity67 ’s house and two hours to print their miniature doppelgangers in plastic			1
talking about his creations , mr @entity67 said : ' i have n’t seen anywhere in the @entity95 doing cake toppers like this one			2
' it caused quite a stir			0
i guess it is something a lot of people have n’t seen before			0
' he added : ' i did it for fun			0
