not for the first time @entity0 has crossed a line that leaves him in extremely dangerous territory			1
if he offended the fair - minded majority in his first autobiography with the admission that it was his intention to severely injure @entity10 in 2001 , his reflections in his latest book , @entity6 , will spark yet more controversy			1
@entity0 ( left ) has released his new autobiography , @entity6 , and it has some explosive content @entity0 revisits a lot of the things he talks about in his first autobiography but he also deals with new incidents i would n't have missed a drug test like @entity20 how i headbutted @entity21 and gave him a black eye i do n't regret the tackle on @entity24 he did n't even own the bloody thing - @entity25 on the @entity28 dispute i knew @entity29 would rule the world on @entity32 ’s heart attack he admits to an ‘ evil thought ’ about the former @entity35 player , whose career was cut short by a heart attack when he was on loan at @entity39 in 2007			1
he admits to using news of @entity32 ’s sudden illness to deflect the attention away from the 3 - 0 defeat his @entity35 side had just suffered against @entity46			2
‘ i said that football results did n’t really matter , ’ he writes			2
‘ and i had the evil thought , “ i ’m glad he had it tonight , ” because it would deflect from our woeful performance			2
’ he also concedes that , having once joked that he was surprised ‘ they ’d found a heart ’ , he ‘ sometimes forgot ’ he ‘ was n’t the only person with parents and children ’			2
the darkness of @entity0 ’s thoughts are no less shocking however well we already thought we knew the volatile former @entity62 captain			1
talented and intelligent @entity0 undoubtedly is			1
but this second book , skilfully ghosted by @entity64 , offers the kind of insight that will disturb as much as it fascinates			2
some might say he is simply being honest , but here is yet another example of nobody being there to save @entity0 from himself			1
the @entity24 passage was apparently missed by his advisers all those years ago and here , now , is the result of @entity0 handling all aspects of the latest book himself			1
this follows his split from @entity79 , a lawyer he once said he trusted with his life			2
@entity32 suffered a heart attack while on loan at @entity39 against @entity83 in 2007 @entity0 was managing @entity35 at the time and they were humbled 3 - 0 at @entity46 on the same night revisiting that @entity10 tackle the @entity24 episode was every bit as shocking ; not least because of @entity0 ’s warped sense of justice			1
he said he was still angry with @entity10 for accusing him of play - acting when he was writhing in agony - with what was actually a cruciate injury - after kicking out at the then @entity94 midfielder in 1997			1
so four years later , with @entity10 playing for @entity95 , @entity0 plants his studs on @entity10 ’s knee			1
‘ i ’d waited long enough , ’ wrote @entity0 in that first book			1
‘ i f * * * * * * hit him hard			2
the ball was there ( i think )			2
take that you c * * *			2
and do n’t ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries			2
’ the @entity104 responded by banning @entity0 for five matches and fining him £ 150,000			1
in the latest book he insists he is not the least bit sorry			2
@entity62 midfielder @entity0 ( right ) lunges towards @entity95 's @entity107 ( left ) @entity0 's right boot smashes into the knee of @entity24 during the @entity111 derby in 2001 @entity0 stands over @entity24 and shouts at him following his thigh - high lunge on the defender ‘ there are things i regret in my life and he ’s not one of them , ’ writes @entity0 , and how depressing an attitude that is			1
he might have the ability to inspire , and we might sometimes admire him for his fearlessness			0
for instance , @entity0 was still the @entity62 captain when he used a newspaper column to suggest his employers had treated @entity128 like a ‘ piece of meat ’ when the defender was sold to @entity132			1
@entity0 suffered a cruciate injury against @entity24 's @entity94 in 1997 and the defender accused him of play - acting @entity0 's first book ( left ) was controversial but his second has gone even further but it is the thought processes that are as alarming as they are intriguing			1
take this one , for instance , on the club car he returned when he left @entity144			0
‘ i ’d given back the ( club ) car , ’ he writes			0
‘ i drove some f * * * * * * miles in that car			0
every little victory is vital			0
’ anyone who has had an acrimonious split with an employer will relate to that			0
they will probably find it funny , too			0
but coming from @entity0 it just offers us further evidence of how angry and aggressive an individual he can be			1
he offers strong opinions on anyone of note he has encountered			0
the class of 2014 now here is a group who do n’t impress @entity0			1
‘ i wonder about the current @entity62 dressing room , ’ he writes			1
‘ i look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better			0
‘ not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best			0
looking at what happened to @entity173 , i can only conclude that he did n’t have a strong dressing room			0
he had a weak dressing room			0
the current crop of @entity62 players ' should be doing a lot better ' than they are in @entity0 's opinion @entity21 scrap the @entity182 goalkeeper was significantly bigger than @entity0 but that did not stop the @entity184 leaving his colleague with a black eye after headbutting him during a drink - fuelled clash on tour			1
‘ @entity21 had grabbed me , i ’d headbutted him - we ’d been fighting for ages , ’ @entity0 reveals , nevertheless saying that he ‘ admired ’ the goalkeeper			1
he explains : ‘ i had a bust - up with @entity21 when we were on a pre-season tour of @entity195			0
the manager had a go at us as we were getting on the bus , and people were going on about a fight in the hotel the night before			0
it started coming back to me - the fight between me and @entity21			0
’ @entity0 ( right ) , pictured here arguing with his team - mate @entity21 ( third from right ) in 1995 , has admitted leaving the goalkeeper with a black eye after a fight during a pre-season tour to @entity195 the midfielder , pictured being restrained by @entity212 , says he headbutted @entity21 during the fight @entity215 tunnel clash he admires the former @entity217 captain too , and admits the towering @entity219 ‘ would have killed me in a fight ’ when they clashed in that infamous tunnel incident at @entity222 in 2005			1
angered by the sight of @entity215 apparently ‘ trying to bully ’ @entity224 , @entity0 exploded with rage			1
‘ i just thought : “ the f * * * * * * ”			0
they were trying to bully him			0
they were a big team and , in the tunnel , they were even bigger			0
so i said to myself “ alright , let ’s go ”			0
’ @entity0 had an infamous tunnel bust - up with then @entity217 captain @entity215 at @entity222 in 2005 @entity215 ( right ) is someone who @entity0 admits he does respect though , and he thought he would get beaten up @entity237 ’s missed drugs test as a player @entity0 rated @entity237			1
but he was less impressed with the then @entity62 centre half when he received an eight - month ban and a £ 50,000 fine for missing a drug test at the club ’s training ground in 2003			1
‘ he suffered for it and so did the team , ’ recalls @entity0 on @entity237			1
‘ if it had been me , and the doctor had said i had to do a drugs test , i ’d have gone and done it			0
it was n’t something i ’d have forgotten			0
‘ it would n’t have been like collecting a letter at the office , or remembering your boots			0
when a doctor says you ’ve got to do a drugs test , it ’s not an everyday thing			0
’ @entity0 also says he cried in the car when he drove away from @entity62 one last time			1
but he has kind words for some too : @entity237 ( right ) congratulates @entity0 after his goal against @entity94 at @entity264 in 2003 @entity237 pictured in 2004 after failing in his appeal against an eight - month ban for a missed drugs test @entity29 the grafter he recalls with some amusement how @entity62 ’s first encounter with a then 17 - year - old @entity29 in a friendly against @entity272 left @entity273 needing medical attention for ‘ dizzy spells ’			1
‘ we always joked with @entity278 he had actually sealed the deal by playing like a f * * * * * * clown , ’ writes @entity0 of @entity29 , who was signed after the game			1
but he admired @entity29 enormously			1
‘ i liked @entity29 straight away , ’ he writes			2
‘ he was 17 but he was immediately one of the hardest working players at @entity62			2
he was good looking and he knew it			0
looking at some of the other players in front of the mirror i would think : “ you f * * * * * * nugget ”			0
but @entity29 had an innocence to him			2
’ @entity29 caused @entity293 to have ' dizzy spells ' when @entity272 faced @entity62 in a friendly , claims @entity0 in his autobiography ' @entity6 ' @entity0 ( centre ) and @entity29 ( right ) became team - mates after @entity62 signed @entity29 @entity299 ’s such an easy gig @entity0 once said he did not have the phone numbers of his @entity62 team - mates			1
he also said he was not comfortable having visitors at his house , that view having been expressed after a surprise visit from then @entity307 manager @entity306			0
but @entity0 says he enjoyed the company of @entity309 and @entity310 when he was working for television			2
not that he considers such work terribly challenging			0
‘ it ’s an easy gig , ’ he writes			0
‘ i do n’t like easy gigs			0
when i heard : “ i liked your commentary last night ” , i knew i was only talking bull * * * * like the rest of them			0
hopefully my bull * * * * was a bit better			0
’ his latest offering will certainly have an impact			0
@entity0 says tv punditry is an ' easy gig ' but that he enjoys working with @entity309 ( left ) and @entity310 ( right ) @entity0 : @entity6 , published by @entity327 , £ 20			1
