by @entity0 published : 10:42 est , 6 october 2012 updated : 13:24 est , 6 october 2012 these incredible pictures of paintings in the desert have actually been created with a simple optical illusion - by clamping a mirror in an easel to reflect the stunning landscape			0
photographer @entity8 placed a square mirror clamped in an easel in key locations around the 429,690 acre @entity12 in southern @entity13			1
he then angled the mirror so it would capture the beautiful horizon of the desert in sharp contrast to the landscape directly behind the easel			2
optical illusion : photographer @entity8 captured stunning images by taking pictures of a mirror in the desert fine art : the mirror clamped in an easel gives the impression of being an actual painting beauty spot : the images were taken in the 429,690 acre @entity12 in southern @entity13 light to dark : by placing the mirror at different angles , mr @entity8 was able to achieve contrasting light between the background and the reflection mr @entity8 , who also has a background in biology and anthropology , was awarded an artist 's residency by the @entity42 at the @entity12			1
and he used his unique position to capture an incredible array of photos , entitled @entity46 , that show the variety of scenery to be found in the desert			0
he said : ' while staying in the @entity12 , i spent much of my time visiting the borderlands of the park and the areas where the low @entity55 desert meets the high @entity57 desert			2
' while hiking and driving , i caught glimpses of the border space created by the meeting of distinct ecosystems in juxtaposition , referred to as the @entity65 in the ecological sciences			0
the sky at night : the clear night sky with numerous glimmering stars above the desert in @entity13 under the @entity71 : the sun setting behind the rocky hills of the desert which was declared a national park in 1994 camouflaged : straddling the @entity78 border , the park includes parts of two deserts , the @entity57 and @entity81 rocking it : the mirror reflection of a clear blue sky surrounded by rocky mounds ' to document this unique confluence of terrains , i hiked out a large mirror and painter â€™s easel into the wilderness and captured opposing elements within the environment			1
' using a single visual plane , this series of images unifies the play of temporal phenomena , contrasts of color and texture , and natural interactions of the environment itself			0
' the resulting images create the bizarre illusion of looking at a paintings in the middle of the desert			0
mr @entity8 has worked on numerous photography projects on various subjects that can be viewed on his website - including pieces on zoos , global warming and fairgrounds			2
pictured beneath a falling star : in this image , the background is the star of the show barren : the rock formations of @entity12 were formed 100 million years ago from the cooling of magma beneath the surface blending in : the rocky outcrop in this reflection almost seamlessly blends in with the background snow in the desert : mr @entity8 has captured the @entity12 at various scenes throughout the year to see more of mr @entity132 's photography , head to his website at @entity134 .			1
