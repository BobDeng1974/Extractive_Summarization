but the nation 's highest judicial body , the @entity42 , watered down its opposition to the decrees			0
it told judges and prosecutors to return to work and announced that its members would meet mr @entity6 today to try to persuade him to restrict immunity to major state decisions like declaring war or martial law or breaking diplomatic relations with foreign nations			2

the statement also pledged mr @entity6 's commitment to engaging all political forces on the drafting of a new constitution			1

he said @entity6 would hand over his legislative powers to parliament 's upper chamber once a new constitution was adopted in a nationwide referendum and ahead of parliamentary elections			2
