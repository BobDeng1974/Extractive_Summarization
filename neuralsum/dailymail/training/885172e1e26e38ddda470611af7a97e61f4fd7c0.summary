by @entity0 published : 11:14 est , 14 september 2013 updated : 13:24 est , 16 september 2013 this is the incredible sound recording beamed back to @entity2 from @entity3 as it crossed a new frontier , becoming the first spacecraft ever to leave the solar system			1
the rising tones @entity8 observed are made by the vibration of dense plasma or ionised gas and were captured by the probe 's plasma wave instrument			1
speaking in a news conference , @entity15 , principle investigator for the @entity3 plasma wave investigation , said : ' when you hear this recording , please recognise that this is an historic event			1
it 's the first time that we 've ever made a recording of sounds in interstellar space			1
the space agency announced today that @entity3 has become the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space , or the space between stars @entity3 's current mission , along with @entity35 , is to explore the outermost edge of the @entity38 's domain and beyond @entity8 officials added : ' there were two times the instrument heard these vibrations : october to november 2012 and april to may 2013			1
' scientists noticed that each occurrence involved a rising tone			0
the dashed line indicates that the rising tones follow the same slope			0
this means a continuously increasing density			0
' a team still stays in contact with the two @entity3 spacecraft every day but @entity3 's extreme distance , currently around 12 billion miles from @entity2 , means a message takes 17 hours to reach us			2
thirty - six years after it was launched from @entity2 on a tour of the outer planets , the plutonium - powered probe is more than 11 1/2 billion miles from the sun , cruising through what scientists call interstellar space — the vast , cold emptiness between the stars , the space agency said			1
@entity3 actually made its exit more than a year ago , according to @entity8			1
but it 's not as if there 's a dotted boundary line out there or a signpost , and it was not until recently that the space agency had the evidence to convince it of what an outside research team had claimed last month : that the spacecraft had finally plowed through the hot plasma bubble surrounding the planets and escaped the sun 's influence			2
while some scientists said they remain unconvinced , @entity8 celebrated			2
' it 's a milestone and the beginning of a new journey , ' said mission chief scientist @entity89 at @entity8 's @entity90 in @entity91			1
@entity3 will now study exotic particles and other phenomena in a never - before - explored part of the universe and radio the data back to @entity2 , where the voyager team awaits the starship 's discoveries			1
the interstellar ambassador also carries a gold - plated disc containing multicultural greetings , songs and photos , just in case it bumps into an intelligent species			0
this artist 's concept shows @entity8 's two @entity3 spacecraft exploring a turbulent region of space known as the heliosheath , the outer shell of the bubble of charged particles around our sun it is 36 years since the twin @entity3 and 2 spacecraft were launched and the pair continue to explore where nothing from @entity2 has flown before			1
their primary mission was the exploration of @entity127 and @entity128			0
after making a string of discoveries there -- such as active volcanoes on @entity133 and intricacies of @entity128 's rings -- the mission was extended			0
@entity35 went on to explore @entity137 and @entity138 , and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets			0
the current mission for both spacecraft , the @entity141 , is to explore the outermost edge of the @entity38 's domain and beyond			0
@entity3 's odyssey began in 1977 when the spacecraft and its twin , @entity35 , were launched on a tour of the gas giant planets of the solar system			1
after beaming back dazzling postcard views of @entity127 's giant red spot and @entity128 's shimmering rings , @entity35 hopscotched to @entity137 and @entity138			0
meanwhile , @entity3 used @entity128 as a gravitational slingshot to power itself past @entity156			0
@entity3 , which is about the size of a subcompact car , carries instruments that study magnetic fields , cosmic rays and solar wind			2
last year , scientists monitoring @entity3 noticed strange happenings that suggested the spacecraft had broken through : charged particles streaming from the sun suddenly vanished			1
at the same time , there was a spike in galactic cosmic rays bursting in from the outside			0
since there was no detectable change in the direction of the magnetic field lines , the team assumed the far - flung craft was still in the heliosphere , or the vast bubble of charged particles around the sun @entity3 is bathed in solar wind from the southern hemisphere flowing northward the voyager team patiently waited for a change in magnetic field direction — thought to be the telltale sign of a cosmic border crossing			2
but in the meantime , a chance solar eruption caused the space around @entity3 to echo like a bell last spring and provided the scientists with the data they needed , convincing them the boundary had been crossed in august of last year			1
' it took us 10 seconds to realize we were in interstellar space , ' said @entity15 , a @entity3 scientist at the @entity199 who led the new research , published online in the journal @entity202			1
the new observations are fascinating , but ' it 's premature to judge , ' said @entity205 , a space science professor at the @entity207 and former @entity8 associate administrator who was not part of the team			2
' can we wait a little while longer ? maybe this picture will clear up the farther we go			0
' voyager 1 is capable of returning scientific data from a full range of instruments , with adequate electrical power and attitude control propellant to keep operating until 2020			2
what bothers @entity205 is the absence of a change in magnetic field direction			0
@entity223 astrophysicist @entity222 was more blunt : ' i 'm actually not going to believe it for another year or two until it 's been solidly outside for a while			0
' while @entity3 may have left the solar system as most people understand it , it still has thousands of years to go before bidding adieu to the last icy bodies that make up our neighborhood			2
@entity35 trails behind at 9 1/2 billion miles from the sun. it may take another three years before @entity35 joins its twin on the other side			0
eventually , the @entity237 will run out of nuclear fuel and will have to power down their instruments , perhaps by 2025			0
this artist 's impression shows how plasma flows around @entity8 's @entity3 spacecraft as it gets close to entering interstellar space			1

sound recording is made by vibrations in dense plasma or ionised gas
voyager 1 and 2 were launched in 1977 , 16 days apart
' we are in a new region of space , ' @entity8 project scientist says
scientists claim @entity3 entered interstellar space more than a year ago
study claims @entity3 left heliosphere around august 25 , 2012
voyager 1 is now the first mission to explore interstellar space
