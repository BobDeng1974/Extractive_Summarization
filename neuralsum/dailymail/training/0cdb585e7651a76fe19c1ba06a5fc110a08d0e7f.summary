a luxury car left in a 30 - minute parking space has been there so long nature has started to reclaim it , with grass sprouting from the bonnet of the fully taxed , insured and @entity7 'd black @entity8			1
police and council officials have been unable to trace the owner of the 3 series saloon , abandoned three months ago in @entity14			1
@entity15 has now conceded that the car should be classed as ' abandoned ' and fixed a notice to it stating that it will be crushed if the owner does not claim it within seven days			1
the mileage of the vehicle is unknown but it is still believed to be worth around Â£ 2,000			2
it has become a talking point among neighbours and regulars at the @entity31 with a number of theories about the mystery car doing the rounds			2
at least three parking tickets have been slapped on the car 's windscreen over recent months			1
courtesy of @entity40 - elnegro1979 the vehicle , parked haphazardly over two bays , is fully taxed , insured and @entity7 'd the grass can be seen emerging from under the bonnet of the abandoned vehicle a council spokesman said : ' we 've tried every avenue to contact the owner and it 's now classed as abandoned			1
' the problem was it was fully taxed , insured and @entity7 'd so there was nothing wrong with it			1
' so we had a duty , working with the police , to make every effort to locate the individual before any action could be taken			0
' there was a lot going on behind the scenes			0
we still do not know what has happened to the owner			0
' news of the destruction notice on the four door car - parked haphazardly across two bays - has been welcomed in the area			2
@entity70 , chef at the @entity31 , said : ' it 's certainly been a talking point among our regulars			0
there have been plenty of theories about why it was abandoned			0
it 's a bit of an eyesore and we 'll be happy to see it go			0
' the @entity8 is set to be crushed in seven days after attempts to trace the owner have drawn a blank a neighbour , who did not wish to be named , said : ' about time			1
it does n't give a very good impression of the area , right beneath the @entity88 for people to see as they walk past			0
i have no idea why it 's taken this long to sort out			0
' people have also taken to @entity95 to comment on the abandoned car			2
