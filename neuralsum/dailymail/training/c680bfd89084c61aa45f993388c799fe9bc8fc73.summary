former @entity13 soldier @entity2 , 50 , thought he had escaped punishment for raping a girl of 14 and a 23 - year - old woman in separate attacks in 1986 and 1991			1
he was tracked down after police entered the dna of his son @entity19 , 25 , into the national database when he was arrested and given a caution last september			1
his dna matched those of the historic rape attacks , the first of which happened before he was born the second of which which took place when he was just two years old			1
suspicion fell on his father , despite the elder @entity33 having no criminal record , since the probability of the dna profile coming from someone unrelated to the attacker was one in a billion			0
when police began to investigate @entity2 they found that he had links to the area and matched the description given by both women			1
both said their attacker as wearing @entity13 trousers and heavy boots , and @entity2 was serving in the @entity13 at the time			1
he had originally denied the attacks when police interviewed him and was convinced that his dna would not match that found on the victims			2
when a match was made @entity2 initially claimed it must have been a ' dreadful mistake ' , but he later pleaded guilty to the historic crimes at @entity57 in @entity58			1
sentencing @entity2 to 15 years in jail and placing him on the sex - offenders ' register indefinitely , judge @entity59 claimed ' extraordinary damage ' had been done to both the victims			1
' is there any real remorse here ? ' he asked the convicted man			0
' there were no guilty pleas until he saw evidence that the conviction was inevitable			0
i see no real remorse			0
' you subjected these complainants to horrific ordeals which plainly changed their lives			0
' ' wicked crimes ' : judge @entity59 sitting at @entity57 ( pictured ) said ' extraordinary damage ' had been done to both of @entity2 ' victims as he sentenced him to 15 years jail in the first attack @entity2 targeted a girl of only 14 as she took a shortcut across some cement works on her way home from school on january 8 , 1986			1
@entity90 down : phipps pictured in his younger days wearing the same kind of @entity13 trousers both his victims described to police he approached the 14 - year - old schoolgirl and put his arm behind her head and a hand over her mouth			0
i wo n't tell anyone , ' the girl pleaded , but @entity2 pushed her over and raped her			2
five years later on june 6 , 1991 , @entity2 raped a 23 - year - old woman who had sat down to eat her lunch as she worked in quiet woodland , also in @entity58			1
he grabbed hold of her and she told him : ' come on , do n't be stupid			0
' she realised what was going to happen and pleaded : ' please do n't do this to me			0
' the woman tried to escape but after a struggle he raped her			0
both victims gave matching descriptions of their attacker but @entity2 was never caught			2
@entity117 , defending , told the court that since the rapes @entity2 had undergone a kidney transplant , developed diabetes and suffered a stroke			2
' he feels he wo n't come out of the other end , ' mr @entity117 said			0
detective superintendant @entity124 , of @entity126 's @entity125 , reassured women that such cases are rare			0
' stranger rapes are extremely rare which is why it was important to get a result in the case of @entity2 , ' he said .			2

@entity2 *snared* after his son 's dna matched samples from the attacks which took place in 1986 and 1991
he was sentenced to 15 years jail as judge blasts his ' wicked crimes '
