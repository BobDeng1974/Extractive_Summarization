@entity0 has vowed there will be no repeat of the @entity4 ’s failure to deliver potentially life - saving research into links between concussion and early on - set dementia			1
the @entity4 chairman admits his organisation ’s response to former @entity14 striker @entity13 ’s death aged 59 in 2002 , from ‘ industrial disease ’ linked to repetitive head injuries sustained playing football , was ‘ woefully inadequate ’			1
the @entity4 and @entity18 promised a 10 - year study to investigate the connection between head injuries and early on - set dementia after a coroner found @entity13 ’s brain ‘ resembled that of a boxer ’s ’ but a @entity27 investigation last year revealed the research was never carried out			1
@entity13 's family were at @entity30 for ' @entity31 ' as @entity14 fans paid to tribute to the former striker @entity13 's wife brings out the match ball ahead of the league clash between @entity14 and @entity37 @entity14 paid tribute to @entity39 on ' @entity31 ' , the former @entity14 striker at the age of 59 in 2002 due @entity14 striker @entity42 wore @entity39 's no 9 shirt during the @entity45 match at the @entity46 @entity0 went to @entity30 on saturday for the launch of the @entity48 , which aims to raise awareness of head injuries in football while funding future research , and he apologised for the @entity4 ’s failure to acknowledge the significance of @entity13 ’s death			1
‘ we promised the @entity13 family we would do some research and we did n’t and that is a failure by the @entity4 and yes , we are now going to do it , ’ @entity0 told the @entity27			1
‘ it ’s going to be done			2
there will be a piece of work about head injuries and football			1
we want to get @entity68 involved as well because if we draw some profound conclusions we ’ll need to get everyone involved			0
‘ we ’ll help fund the research and we ’ll put together a working group and we ’ll help fund it too			2
you need to separate the emotion and do the research and ask , “ what do we understand ? ” the suggestion of the @entity13 family is that head injuries are more likely to lead to early on - set dementia and that is to do with heading the ball or physical contact			1
that ’s what we need to investigate and understand			0
‘ let ’s see what the research finds and get @entity68 involved too because this is n’t going to be a @entity90 - only phenomenon , it ’s going to be a worldwide phenomenon			2
it wo n’t disappear , that is for certain			0
that was a bad mistake by the @entity4 ( to not carry out research )			2
’ @entity14 became only the second team in @entity45 history to be granted permission to wear a replica strip on saturday , with their shirts resembling those worn by the 1968 @entity103 - winning side in which @entity13 scored in every round including the final			1
@entity13 represented the @entity14 for 10 years between 1964 and 1974 during his professional career @entity14 players take to the pitch in a @entity110 commemorative kit ahead of their showdown with @entity37 a close up view of the @entity13 gates ahead of the @entity45 match at @entity14 their match against @entity37 was attended by his wife @entity117 and daughters @entity119 and @entity120 , who set up the @entity122 campaign last season after being alerted to the @entity4 and @entity18 ’s failure to deliver promised research by the @entity27			1
‘ my @entity122 died not knowing he had ever been a professional footballer , ’ @entity117 said			1
‘ we were promised research into the issue and it was n’t until we were alerted by the @entity27 that it had n’t been carried out that we knew any different			0
none of this would have happened if it had n’t been for the @entity27			0
’ @entity14 ’s fans held up placards nine minutes into saturday 's game proclaiming ‘ @entity39 is @entity134 ’ in remembrance of a man whose death could yet prove the catalyst to drastic improvements to concussion protocols in sport			1
‘ this is just too important to let go , ’ @entity119 said			2
‘ we have been inundated with calls from concerned families who believe their dads or husbands are suffering dementia prematurely because of the head injuries they suffered as professional footballers			1
‘ there are too many cases for it to be coincidence			0
@entity154 ’s governing bodies have paid lip service to this for far too long and have been allowed to get away with it			0
the @entity27 revealed the @entity4 did not carry out adequate research into @entity13 's death @entity14 fans display an ' @entity39 ' banner during the ninth minute to represent the shirt number he wore at the @entity46 @entity0 has vowed there will be no repeat of the @entity4 ’s failure to deliver potentially life - saving research ‘ my dad loved the game but ultimately it killed him			1
everybody who plays the game needs to know that it comes with a risk			0
players need to leave the field if they suffer a head injury			0
‘ we ’ve been encouraged by the @entity4 and @entity18 ’s response in recent months but it ’s taken them too long to address this			1
’ sections of @entity39 ’s brain were re-examined at @entity182 last year by professor @entity183 , who confirmed the striker had been suffering from the neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( @entity186 ) , which was previously believed only to be found in boxers			2
but studies in the @entity189 have revealed a far higher incidence of @entity186 in @entity189 footballers than the wider population , while sports including rugby , horse racing , boxing and ice hockey are also now on high alert following a massive lawsuit involving the @entity200 and retired players suffering dementia			0
prof @entity183 called saturday 's launch of the @entity48 ‘ a landmark day ’			1
he went on : ‘ though @entity122 was the first former footballer recognised with @entity186 , sadly he will not be the last			0
and the foundation will provide a source of information and support for people within sport affected by dementia , and their families			0
it has taken 13 years to get this far in football			0
we can not allow another 13 years to slip by without action			0
’ saturday ’s match was attended by a host of celebrity backers , including 1966 @entity221 - winning goalkeeper @entity220 , as well as concussion campaigners like @entity223 , whose 14 - year - old rugby - playing son @entity224 died in 2011 after being allowed to play on after suffering repeated blows to the head			2
‘ if one person present at the game had recognised the signs of concussion or understood how dangerous it could be then my @entity224 would still be alive , ’ @entity223 said			2
‘ there has been too much lip service paid to the issue in the past			0
it ’s time to act			0
