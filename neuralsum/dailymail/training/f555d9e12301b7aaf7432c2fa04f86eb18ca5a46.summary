by @entity0 like @entity2 , @entity1 comes with a strict dress code			1
but on the second day of the 175th regatta , rowing enthusiasts showed that there ’s lots of ways to look good and appropriate on the riverside			0
with ladies required to wear dresses or skirts with a hemline below the knee , and strictly no trousers allowed , there were calf - length frocks by the dozen on displays as guests enjoyed the sunshine			1
keeping on trend , lots of women went for printed dresses , accessorising with plain jackets and hats			0
enjoying the sunshine in style : the banks of the @entity31 were full today as rowing enthusiasts flocked to @entity1 to make the most of the weather feeling flowery : keeping on trend , lots of women opted for flower - printed dresses in a midi - length keeping things formal : @entity1 's strict dress code allowed women to bring out their maxi and mid dresses with both designer and @entity45 shops overflowing with all things flowery , flower - printed dresses were a popular choice , in a bright array of different shades			1
though hats are n’t compulsory at @entity1 , most women sported hats to complete the feeling of regatta chic			0
unlike at @entity2 or the @entity57 ’s @entity56 there was hardly a fascinator in sight , with most ladies wearing big shady sunhats to help keep cool and avoid unsightly back - of - the - neck sunburn as they watched the rowers strut their stuff			2
keeping cool : @entity66 sun hats with wide brims were a popular choice to avoid the ever dreaded back - of - the - neck sunburn anyone under there ? wide - brims were a popular choice int he hat department hats off to you ! these women kept the flowery trend going with their flower and feather adorned hats with stilettos likely prove somewhat unpractical when you 're going for a stroll along the riverbank , most guests wore wedges or thick - heeled shoes to save from sinking into the grass			0
as well as the brightly coloured prints , white was a popular choice , with on - trend lacey dresses making a big impact			1
some women jumped on the blazer band - wagon to finish off their outfits , however the hot weather meant that most went for sleeveless and strapless dresses			0
looking all - white : @entity102 proved to be a popular choice today at @entity1			1
lots of woman also joined the men in @entity1 's ever - present blazer trend as well as those in the official enclosure , each year @entity1 also attracts a younger crowd of fans who today enjoyed sunbathing on the banks of the @entity31			2
flowered prints were a popular choice here too , although they ’d clearly missed the memo about not flashing too much flesh			0
summer lovin ' : younger guests in short sundresses took advantage of @entity1 's premium sunbathing spots missed the memo : if you want to go into the official enclosure then it 's strictly no shorts allowed but while women mostly stuck to blues , greens and reds , the men of @entity1 came out in a full - force pink parade today , with pink trousers spanning as far as the eye could see			1
@entity138 power : brightly coloured trousers were a popular choice for the men of @entity1 , ranging in shades from pastel to eye - popping hot pink pretty in @entity138 : two young men opt for co-ordinating trousers - but at least they did n't wear matching blazers too while the pink - trouser trend is usually only popular with upper - class school and university lads , men of all ages were getting involved , providing an eye - popping scene			2
write caption here with the weather set to stay to stay sunny for the rest of the five day regatta , there should be plenty more chance for rowing fans to top up their tans .			0
