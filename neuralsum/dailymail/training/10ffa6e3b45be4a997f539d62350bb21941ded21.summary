by @entity0 an 18th century grade i listed castle set in eight hectares of land has been bought for just £ 700,000			2
but @entity5 , which is in the @entity6 outside @entity7 , @entity8 , will need more than £ 2million worth of repairs to restore it to its former glory			1
the 15,600 square foot three - storey property has smashed windows , crumbling walls , fragile roofing and just one functioning bathroom			1
sold : the grade i listed @entity5 near @entity7 , @entity8 , has been bought for just £ 700,000 but will need more than £ 2million worth of repairs bizarre design : from the front the 15,600 square foot three - storey property looks like a castle and from from behind it is a @entity23 mansion the castle , built for around £ 90,000 in 1797 has been in the hands of the @entity27 family since 1845			1
but current incumbent @entity27 , 56 , decided it was time to sell up as the creaking property 's problems spiralled			1
thieves broke into the home in january 2012 and stole £ 50,000 worth of lead from the roof			1
it was the last straw for mr @entity37 who described the property as a ' white elephant ' and put it on the market with @entity42 and @entity44 estate agents in march 2013			2
he lives in a small flat in a restored section at the top of the property which cost more than £ 100,000 to bring up to scratch			1
although the property was listed for £ 500,000 , it has been snapped up for in excess of £ 700,000 after strong interest from potential buyers			1
damage : the leaky domed roof which has some smashed panels of glass			2
underneath , the plaster has been damaged			0
it will cost thousands of pounds to have it brought up to standard run down : this stairwell will need repairs - or possibly to be removed altogether - when the new owner carries out improvement work sweeping staircase : this ornate wooden staircase lies at the heart of the property			2
but unfortunately the property needs £ 2m worth of repairs disrepair : cracked and damaged plasterwork can be seen at the top of the staircase the property features an ornate glass dome that leaks because several of the panes are broken - and a grand oak stairway has had to be supported with a series of iron rods			1
a large number of the floorboards have rotted completely and will have to be torn out and replaced			0
as the building is listed , however , traditional methods will have to be used to repair the property , adding to the already hefty bill the new owner will face			2
mr @entity37 has exchanged contracts with the buyers although the deal is yet to be formally completed			0
grand : the property , built for around £ 90,000 in 1797 , has been in the hands of the @entity27 family since 1845 the front of the property was designed to look like the grand @entity97 , six miles away , with a clock tower and turrets			1
from behind it is a @entity23 mansion with grand formal columns			0
but the property 's unusual design is its very undoing with windows bricked over inside - and doors that go nowhere at all			2
mr @entity37 's father @entity107 was forced to leave the property in 1941 when it was requisitioned by the @entity109			0
when he got it back four years later it was in a severe state of disrepair			0
a spokesman from @entity115 said : ' we are looking forward to working with the new owners			0
' we need to bring this tremendously important building back into good repair			0
' beautiful : grand pillars and a wonderfully - restored fireplace , this is one of the better rooms in the property			0
many of the floorboards have rotted and need replacing restored : a modern fitted kitchen at the top of the property			0
mr @entity37 had it partially restored at a cost of more than £ 100,000 - but does n't have the finances or the expertise to do the rest of the castle inner beauty : with high ceilings , grand columns , ornate plasterwork and wonderful views this property has enormous potential well - restored : although part of the property has been repaired , these pictures are unrepresentative of the general dilapidated state of the building beautiful view : the grounds as seen from the rear of the property near @entity7 , @entity8			1
the property is set in eight hectares of land			0
