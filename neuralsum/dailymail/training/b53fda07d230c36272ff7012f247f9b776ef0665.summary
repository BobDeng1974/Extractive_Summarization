an @entity1 farmer has reinvented the wheel after an accident left him wheelchair - bound			1
when @entity4 broke his pelvis in 2008 , he wanted to continue work - but found a wheelchair was not ideal for traversing fields			1
after years of development , he managed to do the seemingly impossible - and reinvent the wheel			1
this suspends the wheel 's hub while evenly distributing mass along the chair , giving the rider the ability to easily descend stairs and overcome bumps			1
the ' selective suspension ' mechanism remains static on standard floors or pavements , but prompts a shift upon hitting an obstacle			1
upon hitting the bump , the wheel ’s hub moves into action , extending or shrinking symmetrically as needed and dramatically reducing the shock transmitted			1
the @entity16 's design features a rim that has three shock absorbing compression cylinders			2

' very quickly we understood it ’s not just about putting the suspension inside the wheel , ” @entity16 ceo @entity55 told the @entity60 on tuesday			0
' the beauty of our technology is not only that it ’s an integral part of the wheel , it ’s selective and symmetric			0
' that ’s the game - changer			0
' how it workds : upon hitting the bump , the wheel ¿ s hub moves into action , extending or shrinking symmetrically as needed and dramatically reducing the shock transmitted			0
whereas 30 - 35 percent of the propulsion energy provided to a typical wheel goes into the suspension – to sustain sagging and bobbing – approximately 97 percent of the propulsion energy provided to the @entity16 system goes right into the wheel itself , @entity55 said			0
the firm has already developed a wheelchair and a bicycle using the technololgy , which it hopes to sell soon			1
the bicycle version of the wheel , which is expected to go on sale next year			0
with our unique design , the @entity13 wheel delivers flexibility while preserving wheel functionality with no added energy loss and bouncy unstable sensation , ' the firm said			0
' on flat terrain it rolls like a rigid wheel and only when encountering impacts the suspension mechanism jumps into action to absorb the shock from the impact , lessening the stress to the rider ’s body			0
' however , it says the system could work for any type of wheel			0
the firm is about to starting selling the @entity13 wheelchair wheels , , and hopes the bicycle wheels will follow next year .			1
