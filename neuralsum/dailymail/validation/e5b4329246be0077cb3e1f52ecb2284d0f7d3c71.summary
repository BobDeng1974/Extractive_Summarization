there has always been a great rivalry between these sides , but i never played at @entity4 with any fear			0
i went there as a youngster in 1986 and won with @entity8 and during the @entity10 years we had a team that could go and win anywhere			1
we were a physical team but we could play , and it was almost a compliment when @entity14 tried to match our physicality			2
@entity8 defender @entity16 confront @entity17 following his missed penalty in 2003 @entity16 and his @entity8 team - mates taunted the @entity20 following his last - minute spot - kick miss @entity16 's confrontation with @entity17 was the final act in what is now known as the ' @entity25 ' in 1999 , @entity26 scored that classic @entity28 goal and it turned the season			1
@entity8 could have won the double but @entity14 went on to win the treble			1
@entity32 made a run to drag me out of position , but sometimes you just have to admire moments of genius			0
the other game people love to remind me of is the ‘ @entity25 ’ in 2003			1
in the little black book of opposition players , @entity17 was one not to be trusted			0
he was a top player and a fighter , but he would look for any reason to go down			0
perhaps i overreacted , but the whole team was infuriated by him			2
and i ’m still not convinced i deserved to give away the penalty that @entity17 eventually missed ! @entity16 was part of a physical side that felt they could win anywhere under @entity10			0

@entity26 scored that classic @entity28 goal in 1999 which *transformed* @entity14 's season
@entity8 could have won the double but @entity14 went on to win the treble
the ‘ @entity25 ’ in 2003 *remains* a vivid *memory*
