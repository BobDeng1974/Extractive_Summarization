a @entity17 user wrote an incredibly sarcastic resignation letter to their boss a @entity17 user decided that it was a good idea to write a biting leaving note to their @entity32 's not known exactly where the letter is from , but the writer is believed to be @entity28 since the @entity28 spelling of ‘ apologize ’ is used and the date is 4/24/15 which is the @entity28 way of writing it			1
in the note , the @entity17 user passive - aggressively vents their frustration and discontent with the company policies as well as the lack of emopion shown during recent events			2
throughout the letter , the @entity17 user repeatedly apologises for a number of unfortunate incidents - all of which seem to be out of their control			1
they apologise for the death of a step - mother , sickness and subsequent doctor 's appointments			1
the letter reads : ' i am sorry that my step - mother died so suddenly from cancer			1
i am sorry that i am not a robot and was emotionally affected by her passing and had to miss work			0
' i am sorry that i got sick and had to miss work so that i did n't get anyone else sick			0
' i am sorry i work 47.5 hours per week ( without getting paid the overtime that i am legally owed ) for the last 7 months , and thus have little choice but to schedule necessary doctor 's appointments during school hours			2
' ' clearly i am a terrible employee , and for that i apologize			0
i know you hate people telling you how to do your job , but i suggest you start looking for my replacement			0
' although posted with the caption ' two weeks notice ' , the defiant ending of the letter hints at a rather more immediate departure .			2
