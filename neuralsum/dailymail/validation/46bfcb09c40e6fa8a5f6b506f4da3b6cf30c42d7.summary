a couple that made headlines around the world when their baby son allegedly spontaneously burst into flames four times are back in the news after their second newborn baby son also caught fire			1
in the first incident in 2013 the couple 's first baby , @entity9 , ended up in the intensive care ward at a hospital in south - eastern @entity14 's @entity13 , in the @entity15 , after neighbours had heard him screaming , and rushed into the house from outside to discover the child on fire in his cot			1
his mother , who was working in the fields , took him to hospital and since then he has caught fire another three times , she claimed			1
@entity14 mother @entity26 claimed that her 10 - day - old baby son ( pictured ) spontaneously combusted medics at the @entity29 said that the boy had about 10 per cent burn damage to his feet one of the first serious accounts of it appeared in the august journal @entity36 in 1745 , which recorded how a 62 - year - old @entity39 countess had gone to bed one night feeling ‘ dull and heavy ’			1
the next morning , all that was found in her bedroom was a pile of ash and her legs			1
many other cases followed , and by 1806 , one scientist thought he had the answer			2
in an essay on the combustion of humans , @entity49 suggested that the problem was the demon drink , and he subtitled his article , @entity56			2
the explanation that alcohol was to blame quickly caught on , especially among moralists who were against the hard stuff			1
in 1832 , a popular @entity62 magazine claimed all those who suddenly burst into flames were ‘ habitually drunken ’			1
the notion was so widespread that when @entity66 included an episode of spontaneous human combustion in his 1852 novel @entity69 , the victim — the villainous mr @entity72 — was said to be ‘ continual in liquor ’			0
@entity76 research biologist @entity75 argued in two articles , one of which appeared in the @entity80 , that spontaneous human combustion may be caused by a chemical called acetone that is produced naturally in the body , the chemical often used as a solvent in nail - varnish removers			1
in healthy humans , acetone is normally disposed of through urine , but when people suffer from certain illnesses , acetone levels can build up in the body , and can even be smelled on the breath			0
on the website @entity96 , one poster wrote that her young daughter had ' acetone breath ' , and that ' apparently children have higher than normal acetone levels '			0
professor @entity75 has noted that many of the people who have combusted spontaneously were unwell at the time , and as a result , may have developed a condition called ketosis , in which acetone in the body increases			1
@entity109 can have a range of causes , including alcoholism , diabetes , a high - fat diet , and even , in babies , teething			1
furthermore , acetone infuses itself well into human fat			0
and it is also extremely flammable			0
unable to find a human volunteer to test his theory that a build - up of acetone causes spontaneous human combustion , professor @entity75 made a model from pieces of pork - the animal flesh that most closely approximates ours			1
the ' pork puppet ' was marinated in acetone , dressed in clothes , and placed in a chair			0
professor @entity75 then held up a gas lighter , and the result was dramatic			0
the ' body ' burst into a fireball , and in under an hour , it had been completely consumed by flames			0
in fact , the acetone was so volatile , that even just a static spark from synthetic fabrics could have caused the conflagration			0
all that was left - as is so often the case with spontaneous human combustion - were the legs , which professor @entity75 suggests remain unburned because there is not enough fat in that part of the body to store the flammable acetone			2
for a year - and - a - half , however , there have been no more incidents , until now , after the same problem returned to affect his newborn brother			2
the child , not named , was rushed into the @entity29 by his mother , @entity26 , who claimed that her son 's feet had spontaneously combusted while she was in the bath and that she had managed to beat out the flames before rushing him to hospital			1
medics said that the boy had about 10 per cent burn damage to his feet in an incident that happened when he was 10 - days - old			1
@entity169 said she had heard him screaming and found his feet on fire in a repeat incident that mirrored the ' spontaneous combustion ' of his older brother			1
after over a month in neonatal intensive care unit , the burns have healed and the baby is now fit for discharge , according to hospital dean @entity181			1
however , social workers are now looking at the issue of whether it is safe to release the child back to his parents			0
he said : ' all tests reveal he is completely normal , and the parents too , went through psychiatric counselling and were found to be normal			2
' however medics are still reluctant to hand the child over for fears that one of the parents , they suspect the mother , is suffering from the @entity196 by proxy syndrome in which a parent seeks to harm their child in order to get attention			1
child psychiatrist @entity202 told local media : ' this need for attention is fulfilled by bringing the child into a hospital with a medical condition , and getting attention , and in this case with worldwide headlines there was certainly a lot of attention			2
' spokesperson for @entity218 - the @entity219 for the @entity220 and @entity221 said : ' from all that i have read , it definitely seems like the mother has this syndrome			1
it is vital that she be assessed appropriately and helped as soon as possible			0
also , the child protection systems in the state must intervene in this case immediately			0
' @entity26 , 25 , said the suggestion that she had caused the fire that damaged her two sons was ludicrous			2
she said that she and her husband @entity231 , 28 , had been the only ones around each time the incident happened but it was ridiculous to suggest either of them were to blame			0
at the time speculation had circulated around the world that baby @entity9 was a victim of spontaneous human combustion			1
the couple also have an older daughter , @entity240 , who has not yet been a victim of the condition			0
medics who suspect the mother is to blame for the incidents pointed out that the phenomenon has never been proven to exist , given the large amount of water the average human body contains			2
crematoriums use at least 30 cubic metres of gas , along with 600 cubic metres of pre-heated air , to incinerate a corpse			0
however @entity76 research biologist @entity75 argued in two articles , one of which appeared in the @entity80 , that spontaneous human combustion may be caused by a chemical called acetone that is produced naturally in the body , the chemical often used as a solvent in nail - varnish removers			2
in healthy humans , acetone is normally disposed of through urine , but when people suffer from certain illnesses , acetone levels can build up in the body , and can even be smelled on the breath			0

professor @entity75 has noted that many of the people who have combusted spontaneously were unwell at the time , and as a result , may have developed a condition called ketosis , in which acetone in the body increases			1
@entity26 ( pictured ) has dismissed claims that she is attention - seeking by harming her babies @entity109 can have a range of causes , including alcoholism , diabetes , a high - fat diet , and even , in babies , teething			1
furthermore , acetone infuses itself well into human fat			0
and it is also extremely flammable			0

in the case of baby @entity9 , doctors found average levels of acetone			1
but many believed the parents and a large amount of money was raised to help them after they were forced out of their village with locals fearing that the baby might start a major fire			1
they were even bought a new house with the money and sceptics say the family are clearly looking for another handout by producing a second burning baby .			2

ten - day - old baby was rushed to @entity29 in @entity14
medics there found that he had 10 per cent burns on his feet
@entity357 claimed that he had ' spontaneously combusted '
doctors believe that she may have an attention - seeking syndrome
she claimed in 2013 that her first baby son , @entity9 , caught fire by himself
