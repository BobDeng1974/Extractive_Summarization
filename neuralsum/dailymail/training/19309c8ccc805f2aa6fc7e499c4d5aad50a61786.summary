@entity0 is following in the trail blazing footsteps of his father when it comes to the birth of his first child			1
@entity6 broke with the long standing tradition of royal births being kept both intensely private and totally removed from involvement of the father			0
by encouraging @entity11 to give birth in hospital rather than in one of the royal palaces , and remaining by her side during the birth , @entity6 set a modern precedent for the family			1

last night a delighted @entity6 said : ‘ both my wife and i are overjoyed at the arrival of my first grandchild			0
