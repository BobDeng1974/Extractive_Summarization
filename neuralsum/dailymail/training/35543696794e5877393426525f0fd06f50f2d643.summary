viking invasions evoke images of burly , bearded men with flaming torches who are intent on sex and violence			2
but the conquests to foreign lands may been more like romantic getaways now that @entity10 has revealed that @entity11 's brought their women on voyages			2
a study has shed light on the importance of women in the colonisation of the @entity19 in the @entity20 , suggesting that @entity11 men were family - orientated and not as blood - thirsty as previously thought			1
a new study shows the importance of women in the colonisation of the @entity19 in the @entity20 , suggesting that @entity11 men were family - orientated and not as blood - thirsty as previously thought			1
this illustration shows viking men and women embarking a ship in @entity31 with livestock researchers from the @entity34 have revealed that ‘ significant ’ numbers of women accompanied @entity11 men when they sailed to places like the @entity39 mainland in longboats			1
their study contradicts the popular notion that raiding parties only comprised men , who were intent on raping and pillaging new territories , @entity41 reported			1
in fact , experts think whole families may have travelled on the iconic boats to form instant communities on newly - conquered lands			1
they analysed dna extracted from 45 @entity11 skeletons discovered in @entity54 , to discoverer that women played an integral part in establishing settlements in @entity58 , for example			1
professor @entity60 , of the university , said the inclusion of women on the trips meant that @entity65 could have children and spread more quickly across the northern seas , establishing communities			1
viking expeditions , illustrated by blue line , were carried out across an immense breadth			0
they set foot through most of @entity74 , the @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , the @entity78 and @entity79 researchers revealed that women and children accompanied @entity11 men when they sailed to places like the @entity39 mainland in longboats , questioning traditional views of bloodthirsty warriors burning local villages			1
a reconstruction from the @entity90 in @entity91 , the @entity92 , is shown ‘ it seems to support the view that a significant number of women were involved in the settlement of the smaller isles , which overrules the idea that it just involved raping and pillaging by males going on the rampage , ’ he said			1
the expert conceded that it is true that @entity65 did have sex with local women , but the dna evidence studied indicates that @entity110 women were at the heart of new communities set up in the @entity11 colonies			1
she told @entity114 that @entity11 women established settlements and grew crops , and ‘ trade was very , very important '			1
the study contradicts one of the theories as to why the @entity11 launched raids : that there were not enough women at home , she added			1
vikings who settled in @entity128 spent most of their time producing and consuming alcohol and beef , according to a study by @entity133 in @entity134 , @entity135			2
experts say they did this in part to achieve political ambitions in an environment very different from their @entity142 homeland			2
@entity143 , an assistant professor at the university , said that the seafaring warriors wanted to sustain a lifestyle where chieftains hosted huge feasts of beer and beef served in great halls			2
vikings who settled in @entity128 spent most of their time producing and consuming alcohol and beef , according to a study by @entity133 in @entity134 , @entity135			2
they analysed buildings and human bones found at the site of a @entity11 farmstead the @entity11 chieftains used wealth and cultural displays to flex political muscle with their rivals and to cement good relations with local labourers and supporters			0
his team excavated a farmstead called @entity170 in @entity128 ’s @entity171 , including a chieftain ’s longhouse nearly 100 feet long with a ‘ feast - worthy ’ great hall , a church and a cemetery of 26 graves			2
carbon dating and studies of volcanic eruption layers indicated that the longhouse was built in the late ninth or early 10th century and abandoned by the 11th			0
the team uncovered 38 layers of floor ash , including rubbish from the abandoned house , and discovered samples of bones , barley seeds and imported beads			0
when the @entity65 arrived in uninhabited @entity128 , they found forested lowlands , ample pasture land and sheltered sea inlets			0
the team excavated a farmstead called @entity170 in @entity128 ’s @entity171 ( mapped ) , including a chieftain ’s longhouse nearly 100 feet long with a ‘ feast - worthy ’ great hall , a church and a cemetery of 26 graves the team uncovered 38 layers of floor ash , including rubbish from the abandoned house , and discovered samples of bones , barley seeds and imported beads ( pictured ) excavations show that choice cattle were selected for feasts , with ritual slaughter and the display of skulls common , according to the study , which was published in the journal of @entity211			1
and by examining barley seeds , the experts believe @entity65 may have used them to produce alcohol , as well as for bread or porridge			0
over the centuries , as temperatures in the @entity218 dropped during the ‘ @entity219 , ’ being a lavish host got tougher , professor @entity143 explained			0
cattle had to be kept indoors in large barns during the winter so ‘ they [ the @entity65 ] had to decide how many to slaughter and store , ’ he said			0
‘ they did n’t have salt , so they had to use big vats of curdled milk as a preservative ’ as the landscape changed due to erosion , climate shifts and cleared forests , it became harder to rear larger numbers of cattle			0
high - status households also struggled to grow enough grain for beer - making and local consumption , based on historical accounts , which have now been confirmed by archaeological data			0
‘ it got harder and harder to keep up that showiness – and when that collapsed , you did n’t have that power , that beer and big slabs of beef to show off , ’ he said , explaining that the power of chieftains diminished			0
over time , sheep farming replaced the raising of cattle			0
professor @entity143 argues that @entity11 chieftains ’ drive to produce expensive beef and beer caused them to put their political aspirations above the greater good of the community			0
‘ maybe we do n’t need the @entity65 to prove this , but it shows you that politics can become more important than creating a productive society			0
’ the research , which was published in the @entity269 , compared the 1,000 - year - old mitochondrial dna of @entity11 skeletons to that of modern - day people living in @entity54 , @entity128 , @entity58 and other places in north west @entity74			1
from this biological data , the experts built up a picture of how the maternal @entity110 lineage spread throughout areas that were colonised			0
experts think whole families may have travelled on the iconic boats ( illustrated ) to form ‘ instant ’ communities on newly - conquered lands the scientists extracted teeth and shaved off small wedges of bones from 45 @entity110 skeletons dating to between 796ad and @entity290			1
they were discovered at various locations across @entity54 and are on display in the @entity293 at the @entity34 , @entity114 reported			2
the experts examined mitochondrial dna			2
mitochondria were houses in the cytoplasm of a woman 's egg and are passed down from a woman to her children , revealing the maternal lineage			0
they compared the genetic material with mitochondrial dna from 5,191 people from across @entity74			0
the norse material closely matched the maternal dna of modern @entity218 people living in the @entity58 and @entity311 , but was most closely related to people living from @entity313 and the @entity92			0
@entity314 , a visiting professor at the @entity34 , said that @entity11 women , as well as men , played an important role in setting up communities outside their native lands in @entity54 , @entity320 and @entity311			1
he said that the male warriors did n’t collect female slaves on the way from @entity324 , as previously suggested			1
a study in 2001 suggested that @entity11 men travelled alone before picking up @entity328 women on their way to @entity128			1
he added : ‘ we know they transported cattle , sheep and other livestock , so why not take the kids as well ? ‘ i think we ’re looking at family groups rather than just adult men and women			1
’ he told @entity114 : ‘ when raiding activities started to become a more permanent thing , then at some point you may actually see families are traveling along and staying in the camps			0
' the researchers hope to compare @entity10 to ancient @entity10 from @entity58 , @entity39 and beyond to better understand how these people were related .			0

dna evidence suggests women accompanied men on raiding trips
study hints men were family - orientated and children may have come too
women played helped to establish new settlements , trade and had children
study questions *stereotype* of raping and pillaging warriors
experts from @entity34 say that male warriors did n’t collect female slaves on the way from @entity324 , as previously suggested
