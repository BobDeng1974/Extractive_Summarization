' viewed with red - green glasses , the active dust devils seem to float above the surface , ' says the @entity3 's @entity4 the @entity5 captured three dust devils thundering across the surface of the planet - and if you happen to have a pair of red - green 3d glasses handy , you can even see them in @entity12			1
' viewed with red - green glasses , the active dust devils seem to float above the surface , ' says the @entity3 's @entity4 , ' there are also some bright lines present in only the later image - those are the tracks of dust devils that passed through this region in the prior two weeks			1
' despite the atmosphere on @entity23 being desperately thin – one per cent of @entity25 ’s pressure – the planet 's winds are strong enough to produce dramatic dust devils			1
the dust devils whirl at huge speeds and can be bigger than any tornadoes on @entity25			1
the trio captured this week were tiddlers compared to some of the ' devils ' seen this year - on march 14 , the @entity5 snapped a 12 - mile - high monster			1
the ' devil ' left a streak across the planet 's surface - it 's just 70 yards wide , but higher than @entity25 tornadoes , a column of dust whirling so fast it would sandblast anything in it			2
' because the density of @entity23 ' atmosphere is so low , even a high velocity dust devil is unlikely to knock you over , ' says the @entity3 team which posted the video			0
' however , you might be blasted by any sand or dust particles carried along by the dust devil , which might scratch the visor of your space suit quickly if you were caught outside by this monster			0
' the @entity59 camera on board @entity60 's @entity5 captured a 12 - mile - high dust devil this month despite the atmosphere on @entity23 being desperately thin ¿ one per cent of @entity64 s pressure ¿ the planet 's winds are strong enough to produce dramatic dust devils , say @entity3 researchers the dust devil is the same size as a tornado on earth , but is a plume of dust whirling at a speed that would sandblast a spacesuit 's visor the length of the shadow indicates that the dust plume reached a height of 12 miles above the surface			1
dozens of smaller dust devils were captured by the @entity5 's cameras , ' vacuuming ' the surface around the monster ' devil '			1
despite its gargantuan height , the plume is only 70 yards in diameter , giving it a snake - like appearance that is twisted by high altitude winds , similar to another dust devil spotted recently in this region			0
the dust devil is actually only 70 yards wide despite its huge height just as on @entity25 , winds on @entity23 are powered by solar heating			1
exposure to the sun 's rays declines during this season , yet even now , dust devils act relentlessly to clean the surface of freshly deposited dust , a little at a time			2
dust devils occur on @entity25 as well as on @entity23			1
they are spinning columns of air , made visible by the dust they pull off the ground			0
unlike a tornado , a dust devil typically forms on a clear day when the ground is heated by the sun , warming the air just above the ground			0
as heated air near the surface rises quickly through a small pocket of cooler air above it , the air may begin to rotate , if conditions are just right			0
the @entity5 has been examining @entity23 with six science instruments since 2006 and has has returned more data about @entity23 than all other orbital and surface missions combined			2
one of its cameras is so powerful they can reveal objects on @entity23 as small as an office desk			0
it has taken over 20,000 photographs of the @entity23 so far			0
the orbiter makes a complete circuit of @entity23 every 112 minutes , flying a nearly circular orbit that ranges in height from about 255 kilometres ( 160 miles ) over the @entity140 to 320 kilometres ( 200 miles ) over the @entity141			0
for handling large amounts of data , @entity5 has 160 gigabits of solid - state memory and a processor operating at up to 46 million instructions per second			0
snap happy : the @entity5 has taken over 21,000 pictures of the @entity23 since arriving there in 2006			2
