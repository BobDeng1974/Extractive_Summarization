@entity0 believes @entity2 's march to the @entity4 quarter - finals is proof that clubs do not have to splash the cash in order to achieve @entity9 success			1
four years have passed since @entity11 's takeover prompted a slew of big - name arrivals at the @entity14 , with the likes of @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 signed for hefty transfer fees			1
but the @entity21 billionaire has tightened the purse strings in recent seasons and , with most of @entity2 's expensive signings subsequently moving on , @entity0 has been forced to nurture young talent after finding his options in the transfer market somewhat restricted			1
@entity0 says @entity2 's performance in the @entity4 shows you do n't need to buy big @entity2 's new - found financial prudence is beginning to yield results , however , with @entity34 et @entity33 third in @entity35 and still in with a chance of qualifying for the semi-finals of @entity9 football 's premier club competition for the first time in 11 years			1
the principality club host @entity41 at the @entity14 on wednesday looking to overturn a 1 - 0 deficit from the quarter - final first leg and @entity0 , who replaced @entity45 last june , is proud of what he has achieved in his 10 months at the helm			1
' we went from the worst qualified team in the fourth pot , to winning the group , to knocking out a @entity9 giant in @entity55 ( in the last 16 ) , ' he told @entity57 ' the @entity56			0
' right now , you could say that @entity2 's coach is very proud of his players			2
we 've shown that we do n't need to make big investments to go far in this competition			0
the days of the @entity64 club signing big names like @entity17 ( left ) and @entity16 are over ' the club changed its strategy and the project ( in the summer )			1
they have stayed ambitious but the onus was placed more on the development of young players			0
' @entity0 's young guns will have to be on top form if they are to advance to the semi-finals past a @entity41 side 15 points clear at the top of the @entity79 standings and well poised after @entity81 's spot - kick winner in @entity82 last tuesday			1
@entity41 are bidding to reach their first @entity4 semi-final for 12 years and boss @entity84 is taking nothing for granted ahead of wednesday 's encounter			2
@entity81 ( left ) scored the only goal from the penalty spot to put @entity41 in the ascendency @entity90 ( from left ) , @entity92 and @entity93 take part in a training session ' the clean sheet at home gives us a slight advantage , even though it wo n't be straightforward , ' he told his club 's official website			2
' we now know our opposition : they 're very well organised in defence and possess technique and physicality in forward areas			0
' i 'm optimistic , even though we know we 'll have to put in a good performance and score to reach the next round			0
they 're a complicated side to play against			0
@entity2 do n't give you an inch out there			2
' @entity2 will be without striker @entity115 and midfielder @entity116 , who are both nursing leg injuries			0
@entity41 are without midfielder @entity118 ( hamstring ) and defender @entity120 ( ankle )			0
@entity41 ' coach @entity84 ( centre ) knows his side need to be wary over the @entity64 side @entity126 ( centre left ) leads some of his team - mates on a jog during the training session @entity131 has been in fine form for the @entity134 side and will need to be at the top of his game on wednesday			1
