@entity0 gave an intriguing insight into his infamous management style during an animated morning at @entity5 's @entity4 training camp			1
the 62 - year - old @entity6 is set to be named as @entity8 's permanent replacement at @entity9 next week but is busy preparing his @entity5 squad for the summer showpiece in @entity12			1
while many of his country 's stars - such as @entity9 striker @entity17 - are still involved in club action across @entity19 , @entity13 is working with players from the @entity6 league whose domestic season is already over			1
@entity51 defenders @entity32 and @entity34 watched on as @entity26 was dragged , literally , in the direction @entity13 wanted			2
while @entity53 may be many fans ' choice to take the hot seat at @entity57 due to his links with @entity9 's glorious past , @entity13 will not shy away from sweeping away any deadwood and imposing his own , distinct style on the squad			2
that approach has left a sour taste at several of his previous clubs , including @entity66 and @entity67			0
in addition , many big names have admitted becoming disillusioned with his attitude , notably @entity72 , who branded him a ' dictator with no sense of humour '			0
attention : @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 listen as @entity13 barks out more orders hard yards : @entity83 , @entity32 , @entity79 , @entity84 are on the left side of their coaches ( front to back ) with @entity80 , @entity89 , @entity34 and @entity90 on the right hands up : @entity13 speaks animatedly to his players ( left ) and makes another forceful point ( right ) but with spots in his @entity97 squad up for grabs , the @entity6 youngsters were in no position to argue and listened intently to @entity13 's instructions			1
@entity80 , the @entity27 left back and son of @entity13 's assistant , @entity102 , was among the players listening in as their boss barked orders at the training camp in @entity107			1
another one of the @entity5 assistant coaches @entity109 , who could also team up with his boss at @entity9 was also in attendance , along with @entity112			2
gather round : the @entity6 squad obediently listen to their ringleader deliver his instructions @entity116 faced : @entity13 shows off his notoriously stern manner during training in @entity43 @entity13 has revealed he would love to be the next manager of @entity9 and will be unveiled once he and the club have agreed the make - up of his coaching staff			1
the former @entity27 boss is still talking to other clubs but told @entity125 : ‘ i would love the ( @entity9 ) job			2
for every coach who takes the job it ’s a fantastic challenge			0
‘ i hope i shall be the one but you ’ll have to wait and see			0
there are more clubs interested			0
it is a process we ’re in and everybody has to wait patiently on my choice and that of the clubs			0
‘ but @entity9 are the biggest club in the world ’			0
lighter moment ; the @entity5 boss shares a joke with his assistants @entity109 and @entity145 ( right ) serious moment : the former @entity27 and @entity66 boss looks stern for a moment @entity9 have agreed most of the details with @entity13 but want to announce his appointment , and the composition of his coaching staff , all at the same time , rather than have a drip - feed of information as was the case when @entity8 took the job last year			1
@entity9 also have to be sensitive to the needs and demands of the @entity6 fa			0
@entity5 have a @entity97 to prepare for under @entity13 and understandably do not want their preparations disrupted by the publicity surrounding their coach ’s future beyond @entity12 2014 .			1
