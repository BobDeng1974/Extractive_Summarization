by @entity0 published : 22:42 est , 7 january 2013 updated : 00:18 est , 8 january 2013 a new outlandish theory has been proposed to explain how the aircraft carrying @entity4 fashion heir @entity3 and five others vanished without a trace from the skies above the @entity8 last friday			1
it apparently fell victim to the ' @entity11 ' , a paranormal phenomenon that has been compared to the notorious @entity13 which has been blamed for the loss of planes and ships in the @entity17 for the past 60 plus years			1
since the 1990s at least 15 aircraft have crashed or disappeared on the 87 mile journey from the island resort of @entity22 to the @entity24 capital , @entity25 , and now the failure to find @entity28 's flight has raised the spectre of the so - called curse again			1
cursed ? : @entity31 --- aerial view of @entity33 in @entity34 where @entity3 disappeared while on flight from the archipelago to the capital , @entity25 in 2008 , 14 people died when a plane making the exact same journey @entity28 embarked upon disappeared and no wreckage was ever recovered and only one body ever found according to @entity31 , a website on civil aviation in the @entity46 country			1
and to date , four days after his plane went missing , no trace of @entity28 has been found			1
a hotel owner on the archipelago said that the plane , a twin - engine @entity53 built in 1968 , was last seen by him entering into a bank of clouds			0
@entity31 ’s civil aviation authority said the aircraft ’s last recorded position was 18km south of the @entity22			0
missing : @entity3 and his wife @entity61 are feared dead after the aircraft they were flying in went missing after taking off from the resort of @entity22 on friday some have questioned whether @entity28 fell victim to the so called ' @entity67 ' as he attempted to make it to @entity25 some have questioned whether @entity28 fell victim to the so called ' @entity67 ' as he attempted to make it to @entity25 the @entity73 aircraft @entity74 , which was reported missing on january 4 , 2013 , is pictured in this undated handout photo some have claimed that like the mysterious @entity13 , the ' @entity11 ' means that unfortunate souls are abducted by aliens , kidnapped by the last remaining residents of @entity80 , or slightly more realistically are hit by massive releases of methane gas from the seafloor			1
however , like the @entity13 , which stretches between the @entity17 island , @entity86 and @entity87 , no evidence has ever been found to back up any theories aside from the incidences of strange vanishings			2
but , like the @entity13 , the route from @entity22 to @entity25 is heavily traveled and proportionally sees no more disappearances than any other area			1
however , both regions produce unpredictable storms and the @entity96 is particularly fast and turbulent in the case of the @entity13			2
' there 's always some explanation for these things , even if it takes many years to uncover the answer , ' @entity98 , editor of @entity99 , told the @entity105			0
' pilots prefer to concentrate on the things that genuinely will help them live longer , such as fuel gauges , weather reports and engine inspections … it is too early to know for sure what caused this latest incident			0
' @entity31 's @entity115 showing members of @entity31 's @entity117 searching for the small plane which went missing late friday on a flight from the @entity22 islands to @entity25 map of the @entity17 , showing the southeast @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , the @entity125 and @entity87 , with the @entity13 highlighted a small plane with 14 people aboard disappeared off the @entity24 coast en - route to the @entity22 islands in january 2008 - in a mysterious incident similar to that which has affected @entity3 in @entity134 's @entity133 searching for extraterrestrials discover the returned aircraft of flight 19 in the @entity138 in @entity139 however , curse or not , at 1.5 million square miles , the @entity13 dwarfs the area tainted by the hex on the @entity22			1
the first written boundaries of the triangle are the eastern seaboard of the @entity121 , @entity145 , @entity87 and the @entity147 island of @entity13			2
however , the @entity148 does not recognise the existence of the area and says that there is no issue with the zone , which is one of the most heavily traveled shipping lanes in the world			0
despite all evidence to the contrary , there have been famous disappearances inside the triangle beginning with the loss of the iconic flight 19			0
five @entity165 tropedo bombers vanished on december 5th 1945 , while flying over the @entity17 after they took off from @entity166 and were meant to circle back and return after a training flight			2
while no wreckage was recovered , a tanker off the coast of @entity86 reported seeing an aerial explosion and then observed a widesprea oil slick while they searched for any survivors			0
even though , nothing of the planes was found and their disappearance was featured as a plot device in @entity134 's ' @entity182 '			0
in the 1977 film , the oscar winning director imagined that the five aircraft and their pilots were indeed abducted by aliens over the @entity13 and then returned unharmed to the @entity138 in @entity139 over 30 - years later - unharmed			1
there is the so called @entity190 in @entity191 and the @entity192			0
it has been reported that several ships have been found drifting without any crews through the otherwise calm @entity196 has it that in 1840 , the @entity199 merchant ship , ' @entity197 ' was discovered with her sails unfurled but without any crew @entity203 , also called the @entity204 exists off the coast of @entity206 , south of @entity209 @entity208 people believed that dragons lived there and numerous ships and aircraft are supposed to have perished in this otherwise calm sea area .			0
