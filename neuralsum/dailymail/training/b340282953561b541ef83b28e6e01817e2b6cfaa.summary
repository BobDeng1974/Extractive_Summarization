protest : reporter @entity12 , right , and colleagues at @entity33 call for the release of journalists held by the @entity8 government and protest over the clampdown on free speech in a bid to clampdown on the dissent and growing demonstrations , the military - backed @entity8 government has brought in a swathe of laws restricting protest and freedom of speech			1
ms @entity12 told @entity46 : ' journalists are paying a huge price for daring to report what 's really happening on the ground			1
' ' the @entity8 government no longer entertains any critical voices			2

no news story is worth being locked up in this way			0

' when i was there last summer we received a directive from the @entity126 ordering every foreign journalist and photographer to call in every day and tell the authorities where they would be working and who they were going to interview			0

his shoulder was dislocated before he was arrested and he needs medical attention			0
