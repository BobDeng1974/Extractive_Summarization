thousands of jobless brits living in @entity1 could be forced to return home under @entity4 's plan to reform @entity6 welfare rules			1
@entity7 yesterday warned that proposals to clamp down on so - called ' benefit tourists ' would apply to unemployed @entity11 citizens living elsewhere in the @entity6 as well as @entity6 migrants living here			1
new research yesterday revealed that more than 30,000 @entity11 nationals are claiming unemployment and related benefits in countries around the @entity6			1
an estimated 65,000 @entity6 citizens claim similar benefits in the @entity11			1
under mr @entity4 's proposals , which were unveiled in november , @entity6 citizens would face deportation if they failed to find a job within six months of moving to the @entity11			1
they would also be prevented from claiming in - work benefits in this country for four years			0
the prime minister 's official spokesman told reporters that @entity36 living abroad could expect to face a similar clampdown if he succeeds in his bid to change the @entity6 's rules ahead of an in / out referendum on @entity1 planned for 2017			2
' the prime minister is seeking a number of changes to welfare rules linked to immigration			0
' the spokesman told reporters			0
' there would be reciprocal changes across the @entity6			0
' the @entity50 argue that curbing welfare will reduce the ' pull factors ' that attract some @entity6 citizens to come to @entity11			2
mr @entity4 chose to pursue this route after @entity56 chancellor @entity55 vetoed plans to directly curb the @entity6 principle of free movement of people			0
the decision to pursue a policy that will apply to unemployed brits as well as @entity6 citizens could result in a double benefit for the conservatives , who have failed to deliver on mr @entity4 's pledge to cut net immigration to below 100,000 a year , as returning @entity11 citizens would also count towards the target			1
under mr @entity4 's proposals , which were unveiled in november , @entity6 citizens would face deportation if they failed to find a job within six months of moving to the @entity11 but critics are likely to question the economic value of forcing thousands of unemployed @entity11 citizens to return to this country to sign on			2
the revelation follows new research by the @entity82 newspaper yesterday revealing the extent of @entity6 benefit tourism			0
the study , based on responses from 23 of the @entity6 's other 27 member states , suggests that more than 30,000 @entity11 citizens are claiming unemployment benefits elsewhere in @entity1			1
more than a third of the total , some 11,222 , live in @entity91 , with the rest concentrated in @entity56 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			0
the number of brits claiming benefits in these countries is higher than the number of their citizens on the dole here			2
but the situation in many other @entity6 countries is very different			0
the research suggests some 14,880 @entity108 citizens are claiming @entity109 ( @entity109 ) in the @entity11 , compared with just two @entity11 citizens claiming similar benefits in @entity108			1
some 4,880 @entity112 claim @entity109 in @entity11 , while no @entity11 citizens at all are on the dole in @entity112			2
the study also found that no @entity11 citizens are claiming unemployment benefits in @entity118 , while 1,040 @entity118 are on @entity109 here			1
other countries with large numbers of citizens claiming @entity109 in the @entity11 include @entity123 , @entity124 and the @entity125			0
in total they have almost 17,500 citizens on the benefit			0
by contrast , just 261 @entity36 are on the dole in these three countries			0
in total , the study found that about 65,000 @entity6 citizens are claiming @entity109 in the @entity11 .			1
