by @entity0 published : 07:52 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 08:06 est , 6 march 2013 people with a sunny disposition are less likely to have high cholesterol , new research suggests			1
middle - aged optimists were found to have better levels of ' good ' cholesterol , which has a protective effect on the heart and helps cancel out ' bad ' cholesterol			1
they also had lower levels of triglycerides , the fatty molecules involved in hardening of the arteries , said the researchers from the @entity17			1
be happy : middle - aged people who are optimistic were found to have better levels of ' good ' cholesterol , which has a protective effect on the heart part of the reason may be due to the optimists ' tendency to have a healthy body weight and a ' prudent ' diet , say the researchers			1
they analysed data from the midlife in the @entity31 study , which included phone interviews and lab tests for 990 people aged 40 to 70			2
based on the interviews , participants ' levels of optimism were rated on a scale from 6 to 30 depending on their agreement or disagreement with statements such as ' in uncertain times i usually expect the best ' , and so on			0
people with higher optimism scores also had more high - density lipoprotein ( @entity47 ) - the desirable form of cholesterol that is believed to protect against heart disease			1
for every increase of five points on the optimism scale , @entity47 in the blood increased by one milligram per deciliter			0
that same @entity47 increase would translated to a three per cent reduction in the risk for heart disease , the researchers said			0
for comparison , regular exercise can decrease heart disease risk by six per cent			0
optimists also have higher levels of triglycerides , the fatty molecules involved in hardening of the arteries but there was no connection between optimism and total cholesterol levels , or to low - density lipoproteins ( @entity74 ) , the bad ' cholesterol			1
lead study author @entity76 said : ' it is one additional piece of evidence suggesting that our psychological health and physical health are intertwined , and that viewing the world optimistically may have some tangible benefits for our health			0
' previous research by @entity87 and her colleagues had shown a link between optimism and lowered heart attack risk , so they decided to look at whether there was an independent connection between optimistic or pessimistic outlooks and cholesterol , which is known to play a role in heart attack risk			2
@entity99 , a cardiologist at @entity100 in @entity101 , who was not involved in the study , said : ' it 's still impossible to say whether optimism causes a change in cholesterol , or cholesterol influences outlook , or both are subject to some third variable			0
' the @entity17 researchers did try to account for other influences , and when they factored in lifestyles , including diet and alcohol consumption , and body weight - the link between optimism and blood fats became weaker			1
that suggests that optimists ' tendency to have healthier lifestyles and weight may explain ' in part ' the differences in their blood lipids , researchers said			2
conversely , the risk of heart attack and stroke goes up in depressed people , @entity99 said			0
' but nobody has shown the opposite , that all of a sudden if you go from a pessimist to an optimist your risk goes down			0

middle - aged people who are optimistic were found to have better levels of ' good ' cholesterol
also had lower levels of triglycerides , the fatty molecules involved in hardening of the arteries
may be due to their tendency to have a healthy body weight and a ' prudent ' diet , say @entity17 researchers
