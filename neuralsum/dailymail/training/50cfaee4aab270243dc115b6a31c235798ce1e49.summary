the @entity40 lives with the wolves in their cages at the sanctuary in @entity14 , @entity15 friends : mr @entity9 , 48 , has spent 27 years working with the same creatures one of the wolves looks a tad restless as its owners try and stroke it but following a complaint from a neighbour the council said a retrospective planning application was needed - which has now been declined			1
@entity9 says the decision could leave the animals homeless and fears with no home they would have to be put down			1
he said : ' the wildlife park had to be a bit more commercial and we wanted to go down the educational route			0
we wanted slightly different things			0
friends : the 47 - year - old ' wolfman ' , who is believed to have the strongest bond with the wild animals of any human , taught his girlfriend @entity71 , 30 , how to live as one of them our mates : after mr @entity9 met @entity71 at a friend 's house they hit it off and married in a @entity79 wedding howling : mr @entity9 taught @entity71 the ways of the wolf world , and she now has her own pack - two males and a female - at their canine education , conservation and wolf research centre in @entity87 , @entity15 ' the wolves are like family to me and to have to put them down would ruin my life			1
we would never find a home for them			0

the council stated three reasons why the planning application had been turned down			1
the first was that the site lies within an @entity128 and does not preserve or enhance the natural beauty of the surrounding environment			0
secondly , the council believes the site will cause noise nuisance to surrounding houses			0
it also said the volume of traffic entering the site will increase , causing a potential danger			0

her husband mr @entity9 said he has been called a ' madman ' , ' crazy ' and ' a lunatic ' by people when telling them about his profession playing with wolves : mr @entity9 said only one person valuing his work makes him realise he can make a difference @entity159 , who deals with the farm 's marketing , said the decision was made by one planning officer			2
@entity9 says he now has one of two options - to appeal the council 's refusal or submit a new planning application			1
who 's watching ? wolves eat their meat and snarl at the camera in @entity15 as they enjoy their food in the eyes : despite his apparent ease at being accepted , mr @entity9 was often bitten by his wolf family scary teeth : mr @entity9 said some of the most serious injuries they have inflicted on him have been the ' internal ones from head butts and being rammed '			0
