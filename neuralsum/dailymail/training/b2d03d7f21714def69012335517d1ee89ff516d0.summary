after @entity1 qualified for the second round of the @entity3 for the 15th successive season , @entity0 joked that he would send someone different to the draw			1
when they have played their final group game against @entity9 in @entity10 next month , where @entity0 is ‘ 90 per cent ’ sure they will finish second in the group , the last 16 will hold all the usual pitfalls			2
it is an achievement to reach the second round , but nothing more than that			2
@entity1 beat @entity18 at the @entity19 on wednesday to qualify for the last 16 @entity20 celebrates scoring his first @entity1 goal with supporters at the @entity19 1			1

@entity29 ( £ 240.4m ) 8			0
@entity1 ( £ 225.26 ) based on @entity1 ’s status within the game , progressing to the last 16 of the @entity3 is standard for a club of this size			1
they are up there now with the biggest teams in the world and expectations at a club with the commercial clout of @entity1 are high			1
this club charges more than any other to watch their football and yet they consistently sell their supporters short in the @entity3			1
they are much , much bigger than the club will allow you to believe because it gets them off the hook when they are beaten by @entity25 or @entity24 when the competition gets serious			2
the minimum acceptable target for one of the biggest teams in world football is to reach the quarter - finals as a matter of course			0
@entity1 's victory over @entity18 meant they have now qualified for the second round 15 years in a row @entity62 celebrates after scoring in @entity1 's 2 - 0 victory on wednesday @entity0 's side are yet to win the competition despite making the second round 15 years in a row 1			1

@entity1 ( £ 75,037 ) ( average wage per player ) at least @entity0 , who developed an obsession with the competition , accepts that it is not enough to reach the second phase			1
he wants more , just as he did when his team came close to beating @entity24 in the 2006 @entity3 final in the @entity76			1
‘ when you work at the football club we realise it ’s not a waste to have that continuity and consistency and i ’m very proud of that , ’ he admitted			2
‘ the club deserves a lot of credit for that			2
but it ’s not enough			0
we want more than that			0
’ his ambition is admirable , but this club is geared up for far more than the occasional appearance in the quarter - final of the competition			2
@entity1 's team may not be as expensively assembled as their rivals , but their wage bill is right up there @entity1 were beaten 2 - 1 by @entity24 in the 2006 final at the @entity76 in @entity99 @entity100 scores a penalty in @entity103 's 5 - 3 quarter - final victory in 2008 1			1

@entity1 ( 60,015 ) ( average attendances per game ) since reaching the final in 2006 , they have lost in the second round to @entity109 , @entity24 , @entity110 and @entity25 ( twice )			1
they were beaten by @entity103 in 2008 , cuffed by @entity26 in the second leg of the semi-final in 2009 and taken apart by @entity24 in 2010 , when they lost 6 - 3 on aggregate			0
winning it takes a special team and a good slice of luck , but we still laud the achievements of 10 - time winners @entity23 , @entity110 ( 7 ) , @entity25 ( 5 ) , @entity103 ( 5 ) , @entity24 ( 4 ) and @entity121 ( 4 )			0
every which way you look at the set - up around the @entity19 , from matchday revenue to salaries to stadium and training ground facilities to transfers , @entity1 should be doing better in @entity130			1
according to @entity132 ’s @entity131 , published last january , @entity1 are the eighth biggest club in @entity134 football by revenue			1
last year , @entity1 were beaten 3 - 1 on aggregate by @entity25 in the first knockout round @entity139 scores for @entity24 as they beat @entity1 4 - 3 on aggregate in the last 16 in 2011 here they are : @entity23 ( £ 411.5m ) , @entity24 ( £ 382.39m ) , @entity25 ( £ 341.66m ) , @entity26 ( £ 335.80 ) , @entity27 ( £ 316m ) , @entity28 ( £ 250.54m ) , @entity29 ( £ 240.4m ) and @entity1 ( £ 225.26 )			1
in terms of wages , sportingintelligence.com ’s salary survey , which was published in april claims the @entity1 squad have the seventh biggest wage packets in world football			1
here is the list : @entity28 ( £ 102,653 per week ) , @entity23 ( £ 96,027 ) , @entity24 ( £ 94,256 ) , @entity25 ( £ 84,671 ) , @entity26 ( £ 83,120 ) , @entity29 ( £ 76,626 ) and @entity1 ( £ 75,037 )			2
this team , which qualified for the next phase of the competition after beating @entity18 2 - 0 last night , also has the seventh biggest attendances in @entity134 football			1
@entity18 ( 80,295 ) , @entity26 ( 75,205 ) , @entity24 ( 72,115 ) , @entity23 ( 71,565 ) , @entity25 ( 71,000 ) , @entity104 ( 61,570 ) and @entity1 ( 60,015 )			1
with a state - of - the - art stadium , always packed with fans , @entity1 need to start acting like a club of their size @entity26 got the better of @entity1 in 2009 in the @entity3 semi-finals where @entity1 really are streets ahead of the competition is , of course , their season ticket prices			1
that is where their fans are forced to pay through the nose			0
according to a @entity170 study last month , the cheapest season ticket at the @entity19 is £ 1014 , although this does include seven cup credits on top of 19 games in the @entity175			1
remember , you can buy a season ticket to watch @entity178 play every other week at @entity23 , who won the @entity3 last season , for £ 174.65			1
you can watch the other best player in the world @entity184 , who has already won the @entity3 three times , at the @entity186 for £ 103.38			2
the seats will be up in the gods , but @entity24 fans can still get to watch a genuine great setting records			0
a season ticket to watch @entity23 play costs as little as £ 174.65 a season ticket to watch @entity184 's @entity24 in action starts at £ 103.38 at @entity1 , where ticket prices can fetch £ 97 for a seat , they get to admire the brilliance of @entity62 now that he is wearing their famous red and white shirt			1
it is something of a shame that @entity1 continue to announce their official attendance because it is actually the number of seats sold			1
last night , for example , there were perhaps 5,000 more empty seats dotted around the stadium			0
still , the cash has already been counted from the fans who pay through the nose to watch this team and that means they can pay the bills			2
when the draw for the second round of the @entity3 on december 15 , it is time for @entity1 to pay them back .			1

@entity1 beat @entity18 on wednesday to seal place in last 16
@entity220 means @entity1 have reached second round 15 years in a row
@entity1 have eighth highest revenue and seventh highest wage bill
@entity228 club have seventh highest attendance in @entity130
ticket prices at the @entity19 are some of the highest around
@entity234 should be aiming higher than just a place in the last 16
@entity1 have yet to win the @entity3
