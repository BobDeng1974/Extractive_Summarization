by @entity0 children of the 1980s spent hours perfecting the art of playing @entity5 ’s @entity4 computer game			1
and now computers are teaching each other to play the popular game , which sees a player navigating a maze , trying to gobble up pellets while avoiding four colourful enemies			2
researchers have managed to develop a method to allow a computer to give advice and teach skills to another computer in a way that mimics how a real teacher and student might interact - and are demonstrating it with video games			1
the student robots initially struggled to learn @entity4 and a version of the video game @entity44 , but the scientists were able to show that with time the student agent learned the games and surpassed the teacher ’s abilities			1
helping robots to teach each other to play games is an important and challenging are of research in robotics			1
experts said that if robots could teach each other tasks , then they could learn to clean houses and make chores a thing of the past , for example			1
pay attention : in the study , the scientists programmed their teacher agent to focus on action advice ( shown in the text on the right of the screen ) as well as giving it no advice so it could learn for itself ‘ as robots become more common , we want them to be able to learn quickly and any time one robot learns something we want to make sure that it can teach that information to another robot , because we do n’t want this information to be lost , ’ professor @entity35 said			1
in the study , which was published online in the journal @entity84 , the scientists programmed their teacher agent to focus on action advice or telling a student when to act			1
they said : ‘ as anyone with teenagers knows , the trick is in knowing when the robot should give advice			1
if it gives no advice , the robot is not teaching			2
but if it always gives advice , the student gets annoyed and does n’t learn to outperform the teacher			1
’ professor @entity35 explained that the team designed algorithms for advice giving and tried to work out when their advice made the most difference to make the learning technique as effective as possible			2
must try harder : the team , which was led by @entity35 , @entity33 's @entity36 in @entity37 , used virtual robots called agents to simulate the teacher and student relationship ( illustrated ) he aims on developing a curriculum for the agents that starts with simple work and builds to more complex tasks			1
his ultimate goal is to let agents teach humans new skills			2
but professor @entity35 said there is no need to worry about computers taking over the world because ‘ they ’re very dumb ’			0
even the most advanced robots are easily confused and when they get confused , they stop working , he explained			0
it often takes two or three times as long as he predicts to get the robots to learn and the easiest way of successfully teaching them new skills is to remove the ‘ brains ’ of the old one and put them in the new one			2
problems occur , though , when hardware and software do n’t work in the new model and this approach can not be used in one of robotics long - term aims , which is to use robots to teach skills to humans , as we can not simply insert their hard drives			2
robots will be smarter than the most intelligent humans within the next 15 years , @entity145 ’s engineering head has predicted			0
computers will soon be able to learn from experience , tell jokes and even flirt , according to @entity151 , the company ’s artificial intelligence ( @entity37 ) expert			0
@entity145 has spent billions of its £ 57billion fortune quietly buying up the world ’s top robotics companies , including @entity158 , a @entity159 company which specialises in machine learning and @entity161 , which makes advanced military robots			0
@entity163 ? @entity151 ( pictured ) predicts that the ' turing test ' moment - when computers become cleverer than us - will be passed in 2029 the 66 - year - old entrepreneur and futureologist , who predicted the rise of the internet and that a world chess champion would one day be beaten by a computer , has said machines will outsmart their makers by 2029			0
in an interview with @entity176 , he said : ' my project is ultimately to base search on really understanding what the language means			0
' when you write an article , you 're not creating an interesting collection of words			0
you have something to say and @entity145 is devoted to intelligently organising and processing the world 's information			0
' we want [ computers ] to read everything on the web and every page of every book , then be able to engage in intelligent dialogue with the user to be able to answer their questions			0
' mr @entity151 predicts that the ' turing test ' moment - when computers become cleverer than us - will be passed in 2029 .			0

scientists from @entity33 developed a method to allow a computer to give advice to another computer
their method mimics the way a real teach and student interact
the student robots initially struggled to learn @entity4 but eventually learned the game and surpassed the teacher 's abilities
