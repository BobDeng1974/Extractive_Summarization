a gas station in @entity6 , @entity7 has remarkably been open for 145 years and has changed throughout the centuries from a blacksmith shop to an auto body shop , and is now run by the founder ’s great - great grandson			1
@entity13 , 56 , co-owns @entity14 with his brother @entity15 and said it has been a pleasure to be an institution in the neighborhood for nearly a century and a half			1
fuel for thought : @entity13 's @entity22 in @entity23 opened in 1868 , three years after the end of the @entity25 old timey : @entity13 's great - grandfather pictured with his race horse ; the station began as a blacksmith shop that made custom horseshoes for race horses new management : a picture of the station when it was operated under @entity35 speaking with @entity36 from his home in @entity23 , mr @entity13 was bursting with pride to speak of the family business , which was established only three years after the end of the @entity25			1
‘ the gas station was started by my great - great grandfather @entity47 , but my great - grandfather @entity13 stands out the most , ’ he said , adding that it was his great - grandfather who is in the majority of pictures that line the shop ’s interior			1
the business started out as a blacksmith where @entity13 would create specialized racing horseshoes and fit them to the horses ’ hooves			1
the owner was also an avid racer himself , and owned several horses			2
the first @entity13 was born in 1873 , and took over the family trade around the turn of the 20th century			1
it was this @entity13 who saw the surge in popularity with the new - fangled ‘ horseless carriages , ’ which , of course , evolved into the modern - day motorcar			2
the service station , as it exists now , is not the original building , mr @entity13 said			1
‘ we think from the things we ’ve seen on the records that around 1917 to 1920 , they converted to a gas station , because cars started taking over in the area			1
’ when @entity36 visited the site , mr @entity13 was not at the shop , which was staffed by brothers @entity76 and @entity78 , who have worked at the station for the last 30 years , @entity80 as @entity13 's service station manager and @entity82 as a pump attendant			1
somewhere out there : the service station is located in the @entity23 neighborhood of @entity6 and is only accessible by car or bus if walls could talk : the interior of the station shows dozens of old black and white pictures documenting the station 's rich history brotherly love : @entity76 , left , and @entity80 , right , are brothers who have worked for @entity13 's @entity22 for the last 30 years ; @entity80 as @entity13 's service station manager and @entity76 as a pump attendant he said they ripped down the old blacksmith shop to build the new gas station			1
a second building was constructed next door during the @entity104 to house more vehicles			0
mr @entity13 said that his luck has everything to do with the common sense that previous generations taught him			2
‘ we ’ve gone from horses to gas stations , we ’ve gone through depressions and recessions			2
we believe in putting ( money ) away in good times and saving it for the bad times			0
’ he continued : ‘ my grandfather used to always say , you always got ta run scared , because it ’s when you do n’t worry about something that you forget about the lean times			0
' they came through the @entity104 , and they never forgot those kinds of things			0
if we ever had money for business , my grandfather would always pay it off twice as fast			0
’ the @entity130 have a history in @entity7 spanning several centuries – before the @entity133 had even been formed			0
mr @entity13 said that 10 generations back , a @entity13 served as magistrate for the area that is now @entity23			2
varied history : @entity78 , @entity13 's service station manager , has worked for @entity13 's for the last 30 years hot to trot : specialized racing horseshoes made by the first @entity13 are displayed in the building on the job : @entity78 answers a call at the station growing up in the working middle - class neighborhood , mr @entity13 remembered spending his childhood alongside his brother at the gas station while their father , @entity149 , ran the business			1
' my grandfather always said never sell your luck , so we have no intentions of getting rid of the station			2
' ‘ it was nice , ’ he said			0
‘ in the 60s , when they had the @entity161 and the racing cars , and everybody came in with their fancy nomads , the @entity164			0
they used to come into the gas station – we loved that because we ’d go for rides			1
’ the gas station , he explained , became a popular hang - out spot , where car owners could get a tune - up , a check - up , or even $ 2 worth of gas , which in the day , went a lot farther			1
‘ when i was really young , gas prices were all over the place			0
i remember at one time 35 cents a gallon , probably in the late 60s			0
i remember going out as a kid , asking for $ 2 of gas			0
the pumps then were so slow , you felt like you were standing there forever , ’ he said			0
then : the station after they switched to @entity185 as a fuel provider ; they 've also operated under @entity35 and @entity188 now : an exterior view of @entity13 's @entity22 and @entity191 's home behind the station their father passed away this @entity194 at the age of 83			1
the son said that he is running the family business to pay homage to him			0
the station has also been through several providers , beginning with @entity35 , moving on to @entity188 , and finally settling on @entity185			0
he told the @entity201 that things began getting tough in the past few years , with skyrocketing delivery costs through @entity185 that threatened to put the family - owned business in the red			1
but mr @entity13 found a friend who sells him gas directly , allowing him to sell his 70,000 or 80,000 gallons per month at 10 to 15 cents lower than any of his competitors			2
it 's electric : a neon sign showing the establishment date is displayed in the window ; mr @entity13 said that he 'll wait and see what the future brings with the advent of electric and hybrid cars major award : the @entity218 presented this plaque to the station in 2001 after 133 years of support to the community give or take : @entity76 , one of @entity13 's @entity22 pump attendants , wears a @entity13 's jacket with a @entity225 embroidered on it , saying it was founded before the @entity25 ‘ it ’s been beneficial for us to work together , ’ mr @entity13 said			1
‘ gasoline does n’t make you a lot of money today , but we did it for our customer ’s sake , ’ he said , adding that generations of @entity23 residents look to the family business as a neighborhood institution			0
he said he does n't know of any other gas station in the city with such a long and unique history			1
as far as the future is concerned , mr @entity13 said he ’s waiting to see what happens with hybrid and electric cars			2
‘ it ’s too vague right now for the future , but we own the property			0
if everything changes and we start landing helicopters , or if it ’s like the @entity253 with flying cars whizzing down the street , we ’ll adapt to it , ’ he said , noting that his family has been malleable to the changing times			0
‘ my grandfather always said never sell your luck , so we have no intentions of getting rid of it			0
