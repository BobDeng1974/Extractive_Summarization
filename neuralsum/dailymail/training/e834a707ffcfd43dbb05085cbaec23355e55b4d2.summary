however , when miss @entity8 arrived in @entity15 , she called herself @entity38			1
@entity39 said : ' i always knew her as @entity38 or @entity41 and her little boy was called @entity10			1
she was very nice and she would come over on occasions			1
‘ she only moved in in january when @entity34 died			1
' she never told me her personal circumstances			1
i just knew her as @entity38 , it was her great @entity46 ’s home and @entity34 used to talk about @entity9 and i did n’t think any more of it			1
i had been looking after @entity34 because she was poorly after she died , @entity38 was at the funeral			1
her father @entity49 came up for a day or two but i do n’t know where he went back to			1
i honestly knew nothing about @entity38			1

she did n’t give the appearance of being scared of anything			2
she was having it landscaped			2
she had all the plans for the back garden			2
i knew nothing about her			2
the car would always go straight back in the garage			2
' i did n’t see her much but she came over one day with the little boy and he played in the garden , it was general chit chat			2
' it was a habit the blinds would be open in the morning , sometimes quite early but on tuesday everything was closed and that was unusual			2
i kept coming to look across the road and i was getting worried			2
' my neighbour said he was going to call me too i rang her landline and sent her a text message but there was no reply			2
i could n’t get any response			2
we both walked to the garage and we could see the silhouette of the car in the garage			2

he was in @entity102 driving up			2
i think he thought it was for a friendly chat			2
i expressed concern and said i had n’t seen her for a couple of days			2
he tried to contact her and told me to ring the police			1
' he said she ’d been depressed at the weekend			2
i do n’t think people can believe it - especially when we did n’t know what her real name was			1
maybe she was running away from something and changed everything			0
it ’s a mystery and just so sad			0
' a police cordon has been put in place across the house in which the bodies were found while police carry out an investigation @entity128 , 82 , another neighbour said : ' there did n’t seem anything at all to be worried about			1

she ’s had a lot of work done on the house			0
it seemed very much like she was preparing for the future			0
