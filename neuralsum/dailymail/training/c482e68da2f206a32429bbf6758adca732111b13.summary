a supermassive black hole 12 million times larger than the sun and powering ‘ the brightest lighthouse in the distant universe ’ has been discovered			1
the extraordinary object is at the centre of a quasar - an intensely powerful galactic radiation source - with a million billion times the sun ’s energy output			1
the nature of quasars has remained a mystery since they were discovered in 1963			0
an international team of scientists has discovered a supermassive black hole ( shown in the artist 's impression above ) at the centre of a distant quasar - an intensely powerful galactic radiation source but scientists theorise that they are generated by matter heating up as it is dragged into supermassive black holes at the centre of distant galaxies			1
the new object , named @entity29 +2802 , is 12.8 billion light years from @entity30 and was formed 900 million years after the @entity31 , which gave birth to the universe			1
astronomers can not explain how such an enormous black hole could have formed so soon after the first stars and galaxies emerged			1
dr @entity37 , from the @entity38 , who was involved in the discovery , explained : ‘ forming such a large black hole so quickly is hard to interpret with current theories … ‘ this black hole at the centre of the quasar gained enormous mass in a short period of time			1
’ the quasar , which is the brightest ever detected in the early universe , was found after astronomers conducted a survey of distant luminous objects using data from several large telescopes around the world			2
the new object , named @entity29 +2802 , is 12.8 billion light years from @entity30 and was formed 900 million years after the @entity31 , which gave birth to the universe			1
an artist 's interpretation of the @entity31 is shown @entity61 's @entity60 ( @entity60 ) and @entity62 's ( @entity62 ) @entity64 telescope have spotted fierce winds blowing outwards in all directions from a supermassive black hole			1
the phenomenon had been suspected , but now researchers have proved the winds are powerful enough to inhibit the host galaxy 's ability to make new stars			0
in the new study , astronomers determined @entity75 456 - an extremely bright black hole known as a quasar more than 2 billion light - years away - sustains winds that carry more energy every second than is emitted by more than a trillion suns			1
' now we know quasar winds significantly contribute to mass loss in a galaxy , driving out its supply of gas , which is fuel for star formation , ' said the study 's lead author @entity87 of @entity89 in @entity90			0
@entity60 and @entity64 simultaneously observed @entity75 on five separate occasions in 2013 and 2014			0
it is stands out as a very distant and old object because it had a ‘ redshift , ’ which is a measurement of the stretching of light to the red end of the spectrum by the expansion of the universe , of 6.30			0
only 40 known quasars have a redshift higher than six , which is the yardstick used to define the early universe boundary			0
@entity29 @entity102 was formed soon after the end of the ‘ epoch of reionisation , ’ which created the star - filled universe we know today			2
it was a transformative era that ended the ‘ cosmic dark age ’ following the @entity31			0
astronomers have uncovered more than 200,000 quasars dating as far back as 700 million years after the @entity31			1
despite their high luminosity they are extremely faint because of their great distance and difficult to find			0
professor @entity114 , from @entity115 in @entity116 , who led the study reported in the journal nature , said : ‘ this quasar is very unique			0
‘ we are so excited , when we found that there is such a luminous and massive quasar only 0.9 billion years after the @entity31			2
‘ just like the brightest lighthouse in the distant universe , its glowing light will help us to probe more about the early universe			0
’ @entity129 co-author dr @entity128 , from the @entity130 in @entity131 , said the quasar will act like a laboratory for scientists to study the way that a quasar ’s black hole and host galaxy co-evolve			2
‘ our findings indicate that in the early universe , quasar black holes probably grew faster than their host galaxies , although more research is needed to confirm this idea , ’ he said .			2

supermassive black hole is at the centre of a quasar - a powerful galactic radiation source - with a million billion times the sun ’s energy output
the object , named @entity29 +2802 , is 12.8 billion light years from @entity30
it formed 900 million years after the @entity31 , when the universe began
astronomers can not explain how the black hole could have formed so early
