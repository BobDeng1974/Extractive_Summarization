it was @entity2 ’s girlfriend , @entity1 , who once joked that her movement on clay resembled ‘ a cow on ice ’			1
it would be unfair to pin that label on the supremely athletic @entity9 , but in the course of friday ’s exhilarating @entity12 semi-final he may have set an unofficial record for slipping over on the coarsened @entity15 grass			1
that may prove the most enduring memory of an afternoon of spills and thrills that resulted in @entity20 winning 6 - 4 3 - 6 7 - 6 7 - 6 to set up a meeting with either @entity22 or @entity24 @entity23			1
he has proved this week in performances against @entity43 , and now the 27 - year - old @entity45 , that this is well within his compass , provided he can discover the consistent mental application that will be required			2
as much as his young millionaire ’s backside constantly bumping onto the hallowed lawn was a reason for defeat it was his occasional lapses at inopportune times that proved his undoing against such a magnificent competitor			0
with @entity1 looking down from his competitor ’s box it could so easily have gone into a decider , had @entity2 mustered a little more composure on the quartet of set points he created in the fourth			1
ouch : the @entity9 grimaces as he does the splits after slipping on the dry grass another man down : @entity20 spends some time on his back after another gruelling point ends as it is @entity20 will contest the thirteenth @entity72 final of his career and try to arrest a run , beginning here a year ago , which has seen him lose the last three			1
as if he needs any more incentive , one more win would take him back to the world number one spot			2
he was quick to give credit to his opponent , saying : ' i played against a future star , he is already a top player with quality shots and a great touch. , ' he said			0
' like in my last match ( against @entity87 in the quarter - finals ) i allowed my opponent back in			2
‘ it ’s a big challenge now for me as i have lost my last few @entity72 finals when i could have won them all			0
' he will be battle hardened this time after a tough campaign here and just about avoided his fate of last year , when @entity97 dragged him into a marathon five setter and softened him up for @entity43			0
nobody will relish the challenge more this time than the man from @entity103 mountains , so driven by national pride			0
the established stars have been somewhat under siege at this year ’s @entity12 , but nobody was going to mount more of a stand against them than @entity20			1
in previous years he has not enjoyed the dusty expanses that develop around the back of the court late in the championships but , ever the great problem solver , his movement has looked more comfortable this time			0
the @entity9 is fine athlete and his falls highlighted that @entity12 needs to try and come up with a solution to the condition of the baseline as it appears to have deteriorated more in the last two years and someone might get injured			1
perhaps the option of clay court footwear is called for in the latter rounds			0
gripped : @entity1 , @entity2 's girlfriend watches on anxiously from the players ' box @entity2 is of a similar elastic body type to @entity20 and made some incredible ‘ gets ’ while slipping all over the place			1
yet it was serving from a static position that often proved a problem with eight double faults			0
there was one at 2 - 4 in the first tiebreak and 6 - 6 in the second , and three consecutive ones in the third game of the fourth set			0
against @entity43 there was also the occasional poor game but @entity20 was able to exact a higher price			2
in warm but breezy conditions the first set raced by in 27 minutes and brief encounter beckoned when the @entity45 broke for 3 - 2 in the end			0
but @entity2 then produced four inspired games , featuring his glorious volleying skills , to level the match			2
winner : @entity20 hits a forehand as he progressed through to the @entity12 final stretch : @entity2 reaches for a high ball during his tussle with the no 1 seed from @entity45 look of despair : the world no 2 sees a ball disappear past his flailing racquet after a shot from @entity2 at his best : @entity20 shows off his magnificent defensive skills as he moves into his third @entity33 final spectator 's view : @entity20 and @entity2 slug it out on @entity15 his sliced backhand was causing particular problems but @entity20 responded by coming forward more , doubtless urged by coach @entity172			1
he saved a break point at 3 - 4 and in the ensuing tiebreak benefitted from the double fault and an ill - chosen drop shot , symptomatic of the @entity9 ’s sometimes skittish shot selection			0
when the three double faults led to him going 2 - 2 down in the fourth it looked over , only for @entity2 to respond with a fighting instinct that must have had his girlfriend purring with pride			1
tough : @entity20 made hard work of match against @entity43 's quarter - final conqueror @entity20 was so pumped to save a first set point at 4 - 5 that he led out a blood curdling yell , and then in the tiebreak had cause to be grateful for his opponent ’s charity when he let slip a lead of 6 - 3			1
there was the lack of a killer punch when he needed it and @entity20 was not afraid to move further up the court away from the troublesome areas around the back			2
he clinched it 9 - 7 and afterwards expressed the hope that the crowd had enjoyed it , which they surely did			0
next : the no 1 seed will play @entity22 in the @entity12 final on sunday watching : @entity172 looks on as @entity20 battles his way to the @entity12 2014 final			1

@entity20 wins in four sets to qualify for @entity12 final
@entity2 forced the no 1 seed into two tie - breaks , but failed to win
@entity20 will play seven - time champion @entity22 in the final
