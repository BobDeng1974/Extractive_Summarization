on thursday , the @entity12 passed a law named for @entity8 that allows children with seizure - inducing conditions to have access to non-intoxicating cannabis oil , which has anti-seizure properties			1
little angel : @entity8 died surrounded by family on saturday , just days after @entity6 passed debilitating : @entity8 's mother , @entity21 , was heartbroken as her daughter suffered seizures and the loss of her faculties as a result of @entity11 disease @entity8 's parents @entity21 and @entity28 had their daughter on a waiting list for the oil but her rapidly declining condition prevented them from taking part in the legislative process			1
on tuesday , @entity21 said she was called and asked if the family would allow @entity37 to be named for @entity38			1
' i did n't know what to say , ' @entity21 told the @entity41			0
' i was honored , but we felt unworthy of it because we had n't done much for the bill			0
it was the selfless act of these women who were fighting and doing so much to allow it to be called @entity6			2
' @entity8 was just three - and - a - half when she had her first seizure			1
up until that point , she had been a normal , healthy little girl who loved dancing and singing			0
doctors were baffled by @entity8 's sudden illness and it took 21 months before her family had a diagnosis : batten disease			2
sudden : before the illness came on , @entity8 was a healthy three - year - old who loved to sing and dance ' it was the worst thing because you 're watching your child go from a normal , active little girl to not being able to walk , talk , see and in the meantime you 're doing all these tests and they 're coming up empty and it 's like what the heck is happening to her ? ' her mother told the @entity41			2
the diagnosis was no relief for the @entity28 family			0
over time the rare condition leads to mental impairment , worsening seizures , loss of sight , speech and motor skills , and eventually death			1
' it used to cause her pain , ' @entity21 said			0
' she would cry and cry and she was confused about what was going on and did n't understand			0
it was horrible to watch her fall and bump her face and her head and her teeth			0
' brave : by the age of six , @entity8 could n't see , eat , speak or walk and sometimes suffered hundreds of seizures a day youngest child : @entity8 ( being held by father @entity95 ) with her family cannabis oil would n't have cured @entity8 's condition , but it would have helped ease the severity of her brain - damaging seizures and prolonging and improving her quality of life			1
towards the end of her life , @entity8 was having as many as 500 seizures a day			2
the oil will also help children with untreatable epilepsy			2
on march 4 , @entity8 returned home from the hospital to spend the rest of her life with her parents , brother and sister			0
the tuesday before her death , she made her last outing , to be present as @entity4 senators cast their votes on @entity6			1
