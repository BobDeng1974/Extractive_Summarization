there are n't many bigger fans of @entity2 than me			1
i think he 's the best goalkeeper @entity5 has produced since @entity6 , and i love his passion for winning			0
but that passion was no excuse for him to launch his head into referee @entity13 's face during the @entity15 derby on sunday			1
the referee had dealt with the incident @entity2 was upset about , and the goalkeeper 's rhino - like charge and butt at the referee was as bizarre as it was unnecessary			1
@entity2 approaches @entity13 near the halfway line after being incensed by @entity25 's block the @entity5 goalkeeper leans his head towards the official , who tells him to return to his goal some might say the @entity31 need to act on this , but i think there is a bigger concern			1
@entity13 is a @entity35 referee so he 's considered to be one of the best we 've got			1
so why did he not send @entity2 off ? think about it : a player charges at a referee and sticks his head in their face			1
that is a red card , and there is surely no room for debate on that			0
so why did @entity13 bottle that decision ? it 's happening more and more			1
big decisions are being dodged by referees who hope the @entity31 will take responsibility the following monday and charge the player they should have sent off			2
this incident is disappointing for two reasons			0
firstly , i actually rate @entity13 as a referee			2
@entity2 certainly appears to make contact with the referee , but @entity13 appeared unperturbed secondly , he has done his colleagues who launch themselves into the firing line - into the heat of battle , into the ugly midst of 22 foul - mouthed , over-aggressive , testosterone - fuelled egomaniacs every week - a disservice			1
@entity13 's inexplicable refusal to show a straight red to @entity2 for such an act of aggression towards a match official sent the message to all players that if they fancy dominating and bullying a referee , they 're likely to get away with it , because @entity2 did			1
this was a great opportunity for @entity13 to make a stand and demand respect for referees			2
he got this one spectacularly wrong			0
i do accept some officials make mistakes			0
just lately though , i 'm left asking the question : ' what is the ref actually watching ? ' the @entity89 handball at @entity90 and the @entity93 / @entity92 foul on @entity94 this weekend are poignant examples			0
but this incident was shocking			0
@entity2 was in the wrong , that 's not up for debate			2
but so too was @entity13			2
an act of aggression towards a match official is always a red card			0
we can only hope the ridiculous leniency of this ref does n't start a nasty trend			0
@entity2 had been angry after @entity25 attempted to block his clearance , for which the defender was booked			0

@entity2 was involved in a furious *confrontation* with @entity13
the @entity114 goalkeeper should have been sent off
referee @entity13 bottled the decision hoping the @entity31 would act for him
