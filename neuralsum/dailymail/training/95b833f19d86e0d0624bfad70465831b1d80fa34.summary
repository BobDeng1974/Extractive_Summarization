@entity1 manager @entity0 is weighing up a move for @entity4 midfielder @entity3			1
@entity1 are determined to add one more midfielder to their squad this summer following the capture of @entity8 , with @entity9 feeling that his new side requires bite and steel in the central acres to complement the composure of players such as @entity15 and @entity16			0
@entity17 of @entity18 is the dream solution and @entity20 revealed on friday that @entity1 have made tentative enquiries over the possible signing of the @entity24 midfielder			2
nevertheless , @entity1 are hopeful the player may put pressure on his employers and they will be prepared to test the water with a bid exceeding £ 30million in the coming weeks			0
@entity1 have also been put off by @entity18 ' asking price for @entity57 @entity56 , with the former @entity1 academy star commanding a fee in the region of £ 55m this summer			0
@entity9 has been impressed by former @entity30 star @entity36 's dynamic and disciplined showings at the @entity62 for @entity27 and he is seen as a pragmatic fit with @entity65 experience			1
the 29 - year - old would be available for around £ 9m and he could emerge as an alternative if @entity1 are unable to land @entity17			2
@entity69 's @entity68 also remains on @entity1 's radar but any move could be delayed until next summer as he recovers from a long - term cruciate knee injury			0
test the water : @entity1 are prepared to make a £ 30million bid to tempt @entity4 to sell @entity36 eyes on the ball : @entity1 recognise the @entity47 side have offered little encouragement for the move			1

@entity1 manager @entity0 wants to add another midfielder and @entity3 is a possibility
@entity4 's @entity36 has @entity65 experience with @entity30
top midfield target is @entity18 ' @entity17 and @entity1 could bid £ 30m
@entity47 club are *reluctant* to sell the @entity89 *international*
@entity36 would represent a *cheaper* alternative at £ 9m
