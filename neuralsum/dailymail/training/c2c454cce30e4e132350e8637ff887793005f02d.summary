@entity0 will hold a crisis meeting with @entity2 just hours before @entity3 takes on @entity4 after the two teams failed to agree which gloves will be worn for the world title fight			1
the disagreement occurred during the routine rules meeting which took place after the weigh - in on friday afternoon in @entity12			2
@entity13 super-middleweight champion @entity4 selected the 10oz @entity15 model for @entity3 to wear , even though the @entity16 prefers to wear @entity18 gloves since breaking his hand in his fight with @entity21 in 2011			1
@entity3 's promoter @entity0 has revealed there has been a dispute over which gloves shown be worn for his fighter 's world title bought after reigning @entity13 super-middleweight champion @entity4 the two fighters face off at the weigh - in in @entity30 ahead of saturday 's fight for the @entity13 super-middleweight title it is understood that the selected gloves seemed much bigger than the favoured grants , which would not have helped @entity3 in this fight because of his punch power			1
it is common place for a champion to select which gloves will be worn but @entity3 and his team were not happy with the model and style selected at the meeting			1
now promoter @entity0 has arranged for three different models of @entity15 gloves to be couriered out from @entity49 overnight – and @entity4 must choose one of them			1
the two teams will now be forced to meet once again at midday on saturday – just 10 hours before the boxers are due in the ring – to resolve the problem and finally select which gloves will be worn			2
@entity57 columnist @entity0 said : ' @entity4 requested that we wear @entity59 1910 gloves			1
these were not of a style we have seen of that particular model before			0
' @entity3 was not happy with the design or the quality of the glove selection			2
we are happy for @entity4 to select gloves for @entity3 but had requested that @entity3 wear @entity18 gloves , as he has done for the majority of his recent fights			1
@entity3 ( right ) looks determined at the weigh - in in @entity30 ahead of his first world title fight on saturday @entity4 ( left ) stands in the way of @entity3 ( right ) for the @entity13 super-middleweight title ' when you 're given an opportunity , like we have been by @entity4 and his team as a voluntary defence , you have to accept certain things			1
one of them was that he selected the gloves and we have no problem with that			0
' @entity4 insists that @entity3 wears @entity15 so we have couriered out three other models for @entity4 to inspect in the morning			2
fighters clearly need to protect their hands and also be comfortable , particularly in a fight of this magnitude			0
' @entity88 meet in the morning , not trying to be difficult , we 're just protecting our fighter			0
he needs to be comfortable with the gloves for a fight of this magnitude			0
' the situation is reminiscent of @entity97 's first fight with @entity98 back in may , when champion @entity97 took exception to the gloves his opponent was planning to wear			0
the @entity102 wanted to wear the @entity103 , known as a glove favoured by big punchers , which had been customised to the blue and colours of his nation 's flag			0
but @entity97 and his ceo @entity111 said there was not enough padding on the glove and eventually @entity98 was forced to wear the softer @entity116 glove .			0

@entity57 columnist @entity0 has revealed there has been a disagreement over which gloves should be worn for the world title bout
@entity4 selected the 10oz @entity15 model for @entity3 to wear , even though the @entity16 prefers to wear @entity18 gloves
