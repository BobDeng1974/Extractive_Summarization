by @entity0 last updated at 8:43 am on 27th february 2012 when @entity3 ’s daughter @entity2 was diagnosed with abnormal cervical cells , she told her not to worry			1
mrs @entity3 herself had also had abnormal cells at the age of 25 and was successfully treated			1
but tests showed that @entity2 ’s cells had already developed into cervical cancer and were spreading around her body			2
' so unfair ' : @entity12 ( left ) died from cervical cancer at the age of 25			1
her mother , @entity14 ( right ) is now campaigning for the eligible age for smear tests to be lowered despite having chemotherapy , @entity2 , a mother of two , was unable to fight the disease and died , aged just 25 , in february last year			1
now mrs @entity3 is campaigning for the age of cervical smear tests to be lowered as she says if @entity2 was tested earlier than 25 the disease may have been caught in time			2
mrs @entity3 , 46 , who lives in @entity21 on @entity22 , @entity23 , said : ‘ now we are campaigning for a change in the law to lower the age for smear tests from 25			2
‘ girls should be having them as soon as they are sexually active			2
how many more mums need to lose their daughters before the government does something			2
‘ we do n’t want her death to be in vain			1
her children may grow up without their mum , but we do n’t want this to happen to anyone else			1
’ @entity41 left behind : @entity2 pictured with her two children and husband @entity43 , whom she was able to marry just hours before she passed away last february @entity2 had her first smear test in august 2010			1
she had suffered bleeding after she had given birth to her first daughter , now five , but had n’t gone for a check up because she was below the age of 25 and was n’t eligible for a smear test			1
the results of her smear test came back showing abnormal cells in her cervix			2
mrs @entity3 said : ‘ it really was like history repeating itself for me , as i ’d had abnormal cells after my first smear test at the age of 25			2
‘ @entity2 was worried , but i told her not to worry as i ’d had laser treatment and then been given the all clear and i was sure that was what was going to happen to @entity2 too			2
’ but then more investigative tests a few weeks later revealed that she did have cervical cancer			0
mrs @entity3 said : ‘ she rang me crying down the phone to tell me that she had cancer			0
she had two little girls aged five and three			0
were they going to lose their mum			1
’ @entity2 underwent gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment and two months later the doctors told her the cancer was in remission			0
she and fiance @entity43 , 26 , made plans to get married and she celebrated @entity71 with her family			1
but just four days later she started with agonising pains in her stomach			0
the doctors initially thought it was scarring from the radiation treatment , but after several weeks she was struggling to eat anything			0
scans showed the cancer had spread to her stomach			0
mrs @entity3 said : ‘ we were all devastated			0
she ’d beaten the cancer once , only for it to come back in her stomach			0
‘ doctors told her that it was a very rare cancer , linked to cervical cancer , and they said they did n’t know how long she had left			0
’ @entity2 wanted to get married , but she was too ill to say the vows , so instead a vicar blessed the wedding rings and mr @entity43 said both their vows			1
mrs @entity3 said : ‘ it was heartbreaking			0
@entity2 had gone downhill so fast			0
she managed to slide the ring onto @entity43 ’s finger , and just a few hours later she passed away			0
‘ i could n’t believe that i had lost my daughter like this			1
only a few weeks before we thought she had beaten the cancer			0
but now her life as a mum and a wife had been halted by this cruel disease			1
’ mrs @entity3 is now campaigning for a change in the law			0
cervical cancer screening has been limited to women aged 25 and over since 2004 because so few under - 25 ’s were found to have the disease			1
local health trusts can not lower the age limit until the government changes national policy			0
she said : ‘ @entity2 had a smear test as soon as she was eligible to do so , but her death has made us realise that there must be 17 and 18 - old - girls out there who may have cancer and do n’t know about it			1
‘ by the time they have waited for a smear test , it could be too late			0
’ mrs @entity3 is now backing a campaign to have the age of smear tests lowered to 20 , which has already attracted a 20,000 - name petition since being started by relatives of 23 - year - old @entity125 after she died from the disease in 2009 .			1

@entity12 did ***n't*** go for check - up despite bleeding after *childbirth* as she was ***n't*** old enough
my daughter would still be here today , says mum
@entity134 tried to marry her fiance , but was too ill to say vows
mother : ' we do ***n't*** want her death to be in vain '
