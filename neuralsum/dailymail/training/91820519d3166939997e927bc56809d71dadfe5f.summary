by @entity0 published : 06:26 est , 10 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:09 est , 10 february 2014 @entity3 has once again proved how ahead of its time it was after being the influence behind a new range of biotechnological devices from @entity7			1
when commander @entity8 has a run in with @entity11 ’s cat , in tv series @entity3 : the @entity13 , dr @entity14 heals his wounds instantly using a simple handheld device			1
the gadget , called a dermal regenerator , works by regenerating @entity8 ’s cells and despite being a work of fiction , the technology could soon become a reality on board the @entity25			1
@entity7 has signed a deal to create ‘ novel biotechnology ’ devices including a system that builds 3d human cells , and another that treats pain externally			1
@entity7 has partnered with @entity33 to build biotechnology including a device called @entity36			1
it will create @entity38 human tissue similar to how the dermal regenerator worked in @entity3 , pictured			1
image taken from @entity43 episode @entity41 starring @entity44 as commander @entity8 the dermal regenerator was a medical device used by doctors and and nurses in @entity50 , as well as by civilians , and other races in the @entity3 universe			2
it was used to almost instantly heal minor injuries like cuts or burns to the skin by regenerating cells quickly			0
the device was also used to heal scar tissue , as well as restore facial features that had been surgically altered back to normal			2
in the year 2369 , in @entity3 : the @entity13 episode @entity64 , commander @entity8 was treated with a dermal regenerator after he suffered from deep cuts on his head caused by @entity11 's cat spot			2
the gadgets will be built under patent licensing agreements in partnership with @entity72 - based @entity33 and are the results of the agency 's @entity74			1
the first device , called @entity36 , will let users create @entity38 human tissue models that can be used for drug and cosmetic testing			1
they will increase the ‘ safety , efficacy and toxicity ’ of current tests and add ‘ greater accuracy , reliability and cost - efficiency			0
’ @entity7 said the technology could help reduce animal testing , too			2
the technology would work in a similar way to the dermal regenerators used in @entity3 and future models could one day heal wounds automatically			1
a second platform , called @entity96 , would be used in medical devices to target pain and inflammation externally			2
the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) already has similar technology called @entity101 , pictured , that sends electrical signals to a person 's brain , which in turn releases natural painkillers the second technology , called @entity96 , would be used in medical devices that could target musculoskeletal pain and inflammation externally			1
for example , devices could be rubbed over the skin and boost the body ’s natural painkilling functions , without the use of drugs			2
the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) has already created technology that performs a similar job to @entity33 ’ @entity122 concept			1
called @entity101 , the device uses a mild electrical signal that ’s placed over a person ’s skin on areas of pain			1
dermal nerve receptors in the skin send these signals through the central nervous system to the brain			0
the brain reacts by releasing neuropeptides - natural healing and regulatory substances , including some of the strongest known painkillers such as endorphins			0
it differs from @entity141 machines , because it encourages the body to heal itself , whereas @entity141 uses electrical signals to temporarily block pain signals from reaching the brain			0
@entity7 said it is interested in the potential these technologies present for regenerating bone and muscle			2
during long spaceflights , for example , astronauts have been known to develop osteopenia - a condition that arises from the loss of bone and muscle mass and bone density			0
the patented technologies will help @entity33 develop breakthrough products for the research and medical communities and advance overall understanding of biomedicine			0
‘ it 's not just science fiction anymore			0
all indications are that 21st century life sciences will change dramatically during the next several decades , and @entity33 is working to define the forefront of a new scientific wave , ’ explained @entity33 's founder and ceo @entity165			0
the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) has already created technology that performs a similar job to @entity33 ’ @entity122 concept			1
called @entity101 , the device uses a mild electrical signal that ’s placed over a person ’s skin on areas of pain			1
dermal nerve receptors in the skin send these signals through the central nervous system to the brain			0
the brain reacts by releasing neuropeptides - natural healing and regulatory substances , including some of the strongest known painkillers such as endorphins			0
it differs from @entity141 machines , because it encourages the body to heal itself , whereas @entity141 uses electrical signals to temporarily block pain signals from reaching the brain			0
in @entity196 , @entity197 , played by @entity198 , used a version of the dermal regenerator to heal a cut on @entity203 's hand , also known as @entity203 , played by @entity204 , pictured			0
the cut is suffered when she tries to remove a data node from a console			0

@entity7 signed two patent agreements with @entity72 - based @entity33
its @entity36 device will create @entity38 human tissue for drug testing
the technology would be similar to the dermal regenerators in @entity3
while @entity33 ’s @entity96 device will be used to treat pain without drugs
the @entity99 already uses a similar device called @entity101
