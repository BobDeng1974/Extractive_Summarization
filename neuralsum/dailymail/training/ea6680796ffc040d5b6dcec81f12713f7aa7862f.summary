peanuts : @entity2 workers face a bigger financial shock in retirement than their @entity6 cousins thanks to our proportionally low state pension @entity2 workers face a bigger financial shock in retirement than their counterparts on the @entity14 thanks to our proportionally low state pension , a study has claimed			1
@entity16 carried out by the think - tank @entity17 ( @entity19 ) looked at how much elderly @entity2 get and how this compares to the income of workers			1
it found the figure paid here – £ 113.10 a week – is typically only one third of the average working person ’s income after more than 40 years in the workforce			1
proportionally , this makes it one of the least generous state pension schemes in @entity34			1
as a result , people who retire without a private pension or any other form of nest egg receive a sudden financial shock , making it difficult to cover bills such as heat , light , food and transport			0
by comparison , the state pension in the rest of the @entity49 works out at around half the national income			1
some countries are even more generous , with the @entity53 getting 60 per cent of the average working wage			1
workers in @entity56 currently get a figure equal to the working wage – although they do have a lower average working wage than the @entity17 and their public finances are in greater disarray			1
the study also found that the @entity17 has a greater number of pensioners at risk of poverty , 16 per cent , compared to a @entity34 average of 13 per cent			1
but the report concluded that the picture was not entirely gloomy for older people in the @entity17			2
it pointed out that the @entity72 has had a positive impact on pensioners ’ quality of life – with only 3 per cent of old people here complaining about living in cold homes , compared to @entity34 average of 12 per cent , and a staggering 52 per cent of those in sunny @entity81			2
the @entity19 has argued for the scrapping of the traditional concept of retirement with efforts to encourage older people to remain in the workforce and earning money to cover their bills			0
to the workhouse with you old man ! the @entity93 @entity17 , which carried out the research , has argued for older people to remain in the workforce and earning money to cover their bills @entity97 , of the @entity19 @entity17 , said : ‘ different countries have their own strengths and weaknesses			2
‘ while the @entity17 has a good record on warm homes , thanks to the success of the @entity72 , @entity102 countries have the best record on keeping older people in employment , which leads to higher incomes and fewer problems of social isolation			2
‘ the government aspires for the @entity17 to be the best place in the world to grow old			0
but while the @entity17 is by no means the worst place in @entity34 to grow old , we ’ ve got a lot to do to top the @entity34 league			0
‘ the government is right to aspire to be the best			0
but to achieve that we must look at and learn lessons from our @entity34 colleagues			0
’ she added : ‘ @entity34 ’s ageing has profound implications for individuals , governments and businesses , and the @entity17 must adapt to a continent where it is projected that almost one in three people will be over the age of 65 , and more than 1 in 10 will be over the age of 80 by 2060			0
’ @entity132 , director of longevity at @entity134 , which sells annuities to cover elderly care costs , said : ‘ as with the @entity17 , the rest of @entity34 is rapidly going grey			0
' this raises a unique set of challenges for government , business and individuals who not only need to plan for their own later life but also need to put structures in place that will help society at large			0

the @entity17 state pension is typically just a third of average working income
in other countries it *varies* from 60 to 100 per cent of the average wage
study also found the @entity17 has greater number of pensioners at risk of poverty
