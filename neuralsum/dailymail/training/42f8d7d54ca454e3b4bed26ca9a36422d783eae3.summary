the good news for @entity1 is that every team to top the @entity3 after 15 games in the last seven years has gone on to win promotion			1
the bad is that it was they who last failed			2
@entity10 ’s double - giving @entity9 just their third win of the season - will have @entity14 worried that fate may befall them again			1
@entity16 was in charge back in 2007 when they spluttered and faltered , gone a year later			2
with the trigger happy fingers of the @entity22 family , it ’s hard to envisage @entity23 - their latest incumbent - remaining at @entity24 if he does n’t deliver @entity26 football inside six months			0
the @entity27 is already the fourth in the hotseat this campaign - although @entity31 left on medical advice - and , despite leading the way , they do n’t seem a side totally sure of themselves			2
it is a miracle they have kept consistent with such upheaval			0
@entity9 's @entity10 celebrates scoring the winner against @entity1 @entity10 rises highest to head home his and @entity9 's second goal of the night @entity9 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity42 6 ; caddis 7.5 , @entity43 7 , @entity44 6 , @entity45 6.5 ; @entity46 6.5 , @entity47 6.5 ; @entity48 ( @entity49 74 - 6 ) , @entity50 6 ( @entity51 79 - 6 ) , @entity52 7 ; @entity10 8.5 subs not used : @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 scorer : @entity10 2 , 85 @entity1 ( 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) : @entity60 6 ; @entity61 6 , @entity62 5 , @entity63 6 , @entity64 6 ; @entity65 6 , @entity66 6 , @entity67 6.5 ; @entity68 7.5 ( @entity69 75 - 6 ) , @entity70 6.5 ( @entity71 59 - 6 ) ; @entity72 6.5 subs not used : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 scorer : @entity68 7 ‘ it ’s not a good result , ’ @entity23 bemoaned			1
‘ we had possession of the ball but played very slowly			0
’ but the night really belonged to home debutant @entity85 and his @entity9 side - one to have languished so badly just weeks ago under @entity87			1
remarkably this was only their second home win in over 12 months and you could tell when the final whistle eventually blew			2
the jubilant new boss - who has breathed fresh life into this part of the @entity96 already - span with clenched fists to his bench ; @entity100 ’s roared ferociously , and it ’s been a while since that last happened			1
@entity85 was keen to remain grounded			1
‘ we kept control and played with discipline , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’ve had 18 shots on goal against a team top of the league			1
but this just the start			0
it showed what we could do			0
' under @entity115 were dreadful at home - barely capable of stringing passes together let alone a sustained run of results			1
what @entity85 is doing is bringing the feelgood factor back			1
@entity1 's @entity72 is tracked by @entity44 of @entity9 during the @entity3 encounter @entity1 's @entity68 scored the equalising goal before @entity10 's winner ' they were ready to get behind something tonight , ' the manager added			1
' there had been a bit of fear beforehand			0
it should be enjoyable to go out there and play in front of that crowd			0
' he has engineered an immediate reaction with four points from his first two games , and they set off meaning business here			2
@entity142 saw a menacing strike blocked in the opening seconds before @entity10 - who had scored just twice all season - latched on to a @entity47 cross to prod in the opener inside two minutes			2
they were n’t ahead for long			0
@entity1 pressed , @entity42 did excellently to thwart the unmarked @entity68 ’s effort , but the rebound fell back to the @entity149 to level up just five later			1
but @entity85 has instilled an impressive steel in a week			1
what ’s also clear is that the 40 - year - old ’s enthusiasm is infectious			0
when @entity50 somehow headed over , the boss dashed to the touchline to applaud @entity157 ’ centre rather than pout			2
they are n’t used to that around these parts			0
@entity42 made a stunning one - handed save to deny a vicious @entity72 thump , but the @entity163 always looked more likely			0
sustained pressure paid with five minutes left on the @entity167 , all alone six yards out , planting a header beyond former @entity165 goalkeeper @entity60 to give hope to a club who appeared to have none .			0

@entity85 saw his side claim their third win of the season
the @entity115 boss took charge of his first match since taking over the reins at @entity100 's
every team to top the @entity3 after 15 games in the last seven years has won promotion
@entity1 were the last side to not win the league in such a position
