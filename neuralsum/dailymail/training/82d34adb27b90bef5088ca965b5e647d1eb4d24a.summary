scientists studied fossils recovered from 73 sites around the world to track global climate to the end of the last @entity10			1
they found that for 70 % to 80 % of this period , which dates back to the start of the holocene era in which we now live , temperatures were cooler than they are now			0
@entity3 is warmer today than it has been for most of the last 11,300 years , new research has shown - and the team say the biggest change has been in the last 100 years since the start of the industrial age average global temperature over the last ~ 2,000 years			1
@entity22 scientists studied fossils recovered from 73 sites around the world to track global climate to the end of the last @entity10 - and found @entity3 is warmer today than it has been for most of the last 11,300 years lead researcher dr @entity25 , from @entity26 in the @entity22 , said : ' we already knew that on a global scale , @entity3 is warmer today than it was over much of the past 2,000 years			1
' now we know that it is warmer than most of the past 11,300 years			0
' this is of particular interest because the holocene spans the entire period of human civilisation			0
' the study , published in the journal @entity37 , provides the first truly global view of climate at millennia timescales			1
many previous temperature reconstructions have been based on regional data , according to co-author professor @entity43 , also from @entity26			2
' when you just look at one part of the world , the temperature history can be affected by regional climate processes like @entity49 or monsoon variations , ' said prof @entity43			1
' but when you combine the data from sites all around the world , you can average out those regional anomalies and get a clear sense of the @entity3 's global temperature history			1
' the research shows that over the past 5,000 years the @entity3 underwent an overall cooling of around @entity59			0
an ice core taken from the @entity61 which was used in the study but in just the last 100 years - since the start of the industrial age - it has warmed by the same amount			0
the biggest changes were in the northern hemisphere , where there is a greater density of human population			0
climate models predict that by 2100 the global temperature could rise by another @entity74 depending on the level of greenhouse gas emissions			1
' what is most troubling is that this warming will be significantly greater than at any time during the past 1,300 years , ' said professor @entity43			0
the scientists point out that , because of its position relative to the @entity83 , the @entity3 should now be near the bottom of a long - term cooling trend			2
yet this is clearly not the case			0
@entity88 , from the @entity90 's @entity89 , which funded the research , said : ' the last century stands out as the anomaly in this record of global temperature since the end of the last @entity10			1
' this research shows that we 've experienced almost the same range of temperature change since the beginning of the industrial revolution as over the previous 11,000 years of @entity3 history - but this change happened a lot more quickly			2
