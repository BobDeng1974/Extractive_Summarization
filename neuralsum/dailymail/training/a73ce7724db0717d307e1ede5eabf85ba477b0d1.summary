by @entity0 the @entity2 fossil , an early hominid which was discovered in @entity4 in 1924 , was significant features which could shed light on the evolution of intelligence a fossil more than two million years old could help explain why man became so brainy			1
the @entity2 fossil , an early hominid which was discovered in @entity4 in 1924 , was significant features which could shed light on the evolution of intelligence			1
importantly it has a ‘ persistent metopic suture ’ - an unfused seam - in the frontal bone , which allows a baby 's skull to be pliable in childbirth			1
in great apes , this closes shortly after birth but in humans it does n't fuse until around two years of age - allowing brain growth			2
the unfused seam allows babies to be born with larger brains , and the delay in fusing allows the brain to grow larger in early life , reports @entity31			1
the @entity2 fossil has become the ‘ type specimen , ’ or main model , of the genus @entity35			0
an australopithecine is any species of the extinct genera @entity39 or @entity40 that lived in @entity4 , walked on two legs and had relatively small brains			1
dr @entity43 , of @entity44 , said : ‘ these findings are significant because they provide a highly plausible explanation as to why the hominin brain might grow larger and more complex			2
‘ the persistent metopic suture , an advanced trait , probably occurred in conjunction with refining the ability to walk on two legs			0
‘ the ability to walk upright caused an obstretric dilemma			0
‘ @entity54 became more difficult because the shape of the birth canal became constricted while the size of the brain increased			0
the persistent metopic suture contributes to an evolutionary solution to this dilemma			0
‘ the later fusion was also associated with evolutionary expansion of the frontal lobes , which is evident from the endocasts of australopithecines such as @entity2			0

soft bones in child 's skull allowed babies to be born with larger brains
pliable skulls grew even larger early in life
