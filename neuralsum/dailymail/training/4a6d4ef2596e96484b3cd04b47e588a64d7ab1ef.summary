a turtle survived a 15 minute fight with an alligator that failed to break its protective shell			1
an alligator bites down with a force of up to 2,900 pounds of pressure but despite its strength , this reptile was still unable to crack the turtle 's shell			1
amazing photographs captured the tussle in the wild as the six foot @entity15 alligator attempted to prise the shell open			1
the @entity15 alligator spent 15 minutes trying to break the turtle 's shell but failed the @entity20 's shell managed to protect it from thousands of pounds of pressure in the alligator 's bite the @entity20 's shell managed to protect as it lay helpless in the alligator 's jaws			1
many academic studies have been carried out into the forces a turtle 's shell can withstand			1
researchers have been continually interested in the evolution and design of the shell and applying it to human armour			2
although the shell protects turtle 's from most predators , larger animals such as crocodiles , alligators and even jaguars are normally able to crush the carapace in order to get to the reptile 's body			2
although expets say the exact strength of a shell depends on the size of the animal , researhers say the animals evolved the shell to avoid being eaten - and as these pictures show , it works			2
tiger sharks can also bite through turtles of all sizes and other predators nibble around the softer edges of the armour to pull the turtle out			0
the protective shell is made from bone covered by a horny shield			0
plates of bone are fused with ribs , vertebrae and parts of the shoulder and hip			0
the shape of the shell also gives it extra strength			0
the turtle was powerless as it was clamped in the alligator 's jaws but survived because of its shell the fight was captured by @entity15 wildlife photographer @entity81 the images were taken by @entity15 wildlife photographer @entity81 , 51 , who said he was astounded to find the turtle still alive after the alligator had abandoned it			1
mr @entity81 , who was studying herons in the @entity86 , @entity87 , said : ' it was definitely turtle one , alligator nil			1
' i was taking shots of a great heron and saw out the corner of my eye what looked like a ball bouncing beside the water			0
' i quickly realised what it was and thought the alligator was going to win in the end at cracking the shell			2
' when he finally gave up i walked over to the turtle expecting it to be dead and was amazed to find it quite alive and on its back			0
i flipped it over and it scrambled into the water			0
' the photographer regularly spends hours on end dressed in full camouflage gear to get up close and personal with nature to capture it at its wildest .			0

the alligator in @entity87 gave up after 15 minutes of trying to break the shell
@entity122 's armour was withstanding thousands of pounds worth of pressure
