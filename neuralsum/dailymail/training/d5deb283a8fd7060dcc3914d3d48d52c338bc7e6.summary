by @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 published : 10:49 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 07:54 est , 10 january 2013 an @entity5 pundit and commentator is now out of a job after he was met with uproar over racially - charged remarks about @entity11 rookie quarterback @entity10 @entity12 , 48 , came under fire last month during an appearance on the sports network 's morning show @entity15 , when he asked whether the @entity19 rookie is ' a brother or a cornball brother ? ' an @entity5 spokesperson said in a statement : ' @entity12 's contract expired at year 's end			1
evaluating our needs and his work , including his recent @entity29 comments , we decided not to renew his deal			1
in a bizarre rant , @entity12 - a former @entity42 columnist - openly questioned the blackness of @entity10 and claimed that he was not an authentic representative of the black community			1
first take host @entity47 immediately shot back at @entity12 , saying : ' what does that mean ? ' @entity12 then launched a confusing diatribe about the rising star quarterback 's color			1
' well , he 's black , he kind of does his thing , ' said @entity12			1
' but he 's not really down with the cause , he 's not one of us			0
he 's kind of black			0
but he 's not really the guy you 'd really want to hang out with because he 's off to do something else			0
' ' because that 's how i - i want to find out about him			2
i do n't know because i keep hearing these things			0
we all know he has a white fiance , ' said @entity12			1
' there was all this talk about he 's a @entity68			0
there 's no information at all - i 'm just trying to dig deeper into why he has an issue			2
all smiles : @entity11 quarterback @entity10 , right , poses for a photograph with his fiance @entity74 ' because we did find out with @entity76 , @entity76 was like , ' i got black skin , but do n't call me black			1
' people got a little wondering about him early on			0
' having spoken about his fiance and his racial roots , @entity12 was then prompted into talking about the man 's hair			1
' now that 's different			0
because to me , that 's very urban and makes you feel like - i think he would have a clean cut , if he was more straight - laced or not like - wearing braids is , you 're a brother			1
you 're a brother if you got braids on			2
' in response , @entity47 , who is also black , said : '' well first of all let me say this : i ’m uncomfortable with where we just went , ' said @entity47 to the other panelists			0
' @entity10 , the ethnicity , the color of his fiancee is none of our business			1
' he can live his life any way he chooses			0
the braids that he has in his hair , that ’s his business , that ’s his life			0
i do n’t judge someone ’s blackness based on those kind of things			2
happy : @entity74 , ( left ) , sits with her fiance , @entity11 ' rookie quarterback @entity10 ' i just do n’t do that			1
i ’m not that kind of guy			0
' @entity10 , meanwhile , had surgery this morning to repair a torn ligament and to determine whether there was any other damage in his ailing right knee			1
a person familiar with the situation told @entity3 that the procedure was expected to last about two hours			0
the person said orthopedist @entity125 planned to repair a torn lateral collateral ligament and examine the state of @entity10 's acl			1
the person spoke on condition of anonymity because the @entity11 had not made an announcement about the latest details surrounding the rookie quarterback 's injury			1
a torn @entity135 requires a rehabilitation period of several months , possibly extending into training camp and the start of next season			0
@entity10 was optimistic before he entered surgery , tweeting early wednesday : ' thank you for your prayers and support			2
i love @entity145 , my family , my team , the fans , & i love this game			0
see you guys next season			0
' @entity10 reinjured his knee at least twice in sunday 's playoff loss to the @entity153 , prompting a national debate over whether coach @entity155 endangered @entity10 's career by not taking his franchise player out of the game sooner when he was visibly limping on the field			2
under the knife : @entity10 had surgery this morning to repair a torn ligament and to determine whether there was any other damage in his ailing right knee			2
