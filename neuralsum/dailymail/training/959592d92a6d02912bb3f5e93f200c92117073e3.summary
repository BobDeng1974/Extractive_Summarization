by @entity0 for @entity1 with a fashionista for a wife , @entity2 has no excuse for dodgy holiday gear			1
but the prime minister has managed to fail again with his non-work wardrobe - showcasing a pair of dusty old brown sandals on his annual trip to @entity12			2
the 47 - year - old must 've been reading up on his holiday trends , because pool sliders are one of the hottest trends of 2014 , but mr @entity2 's effort seemed like they were more likely to have come from 1814			1
@entity2 enjoys a coffee at the @entity20 in @entity21 , with his wife @entity22 seemingly unaware of the fashion disaster lurking underneath their table his wife @entity22 seemed oblivious of the horrors lurking under their bistro table as they enjoyed a cappuccino at the @entity20 in @entity21 this afternoon			1
indeed , the pm should have asked the ambassador for the @entity31 for some style advice before he packed his suitcase for the seaside trip			2
@entity22 , who won the @entity36 @entity35 for @entity37 in 2009 , rounded off her own outfit with a simple , yet stylish pair of flip flops			0
it is n't the first time the @entity7 has attempted the trend either - he first showcased the unfortunate footwear on a holiday in @entity46 last year			2
he should have learnt by now : @entity2 first wore his sliders on a trip to @entity46 with the family in 2013 @entity51 expert @entity50 said : ' when you live in a suit dressing down can be tricky and we know that the art of ' smart casual ' does n't come easily to @entity2 , but there 's no excuse for shoes like this			1
' his wife @entity22 is revered for her style , but it 's obvious from these pictures that she has given up trying to guide her spouse 's sartorial decisions			0
' this style of open - toed shoe - known as the slide - is actually the height of beach chic for 2014 when worn with a nod to sports luxe			0
' but these battered old slip - ons scream ' comfort ' not cool			2
' mr @entity2 obviously has bigger things to worry about than his footwear collection , but if he is interested in stepping his summer style up a level for his next break then i would suggest a pair of simple espadrilles , or if he 's determined to feel the sun on his toes then a new pair of @entity83 is a cooler way to beat the heat			1
' on a trip to @entity92 last month , @entity2 , pictured here in an @entity90 fish market with wife @entity22 , was much more successful with his choice of shoes - these stylish beige loafers mr @entity2 has been far more successful in recent months with his choice of weekend wear			1
a pair of stylish beige loafers from @entity100 hit the right note as part of his holiday suitcase on a family holiday to @entity92 last month			0
and he does n't usually have any trouble with his office attire , typically managing to look much smarter than most politicians while busy with the day job			0
mr @entity2 , pictured here at the @entity109 2014 , always manages to look extremely smart when on official business as the @entity36 prime minister but the conservative party leader has made the headlines for his terrible taste in the past			1
in 2011 , he racked up thousands of column inches when he wore a pair of smart black leather loafers without socks on a family trip to @entity121			1
fashion critics across the country cringed at the @entity7 's hot feet squeezed into the uncomfortable office shoes in sweltering @entity127 temperatures			0
mr @entity2 has also come in for some ribbing from clothes - lovers for his tendency to rely on his trusty blue polo shirts while on away breaks			1
the collared t - shirts have made regular appearances on family holidays regardless of location , from the south west of @entity138 to the @entity139			0
although on recent trips , he has been adding some variation with a series of new button - down short - sleeved linen shirts , nonetheless blue in colour			0
mr @entity2 wears one of his favourite blue polo shirts to join his wife @entity22 on @entity149 near @entity150 , @entity12 on their 2008 holiday in 2013 , mr @entity2 wears a newer - looking blue polo shirt for yet another holiday to @entity12 with wife @entity154 , this time to @entity21 in the north of the county last year he admitted that he struggled with his fashion choices			1
he said : ' i know so little about fashion that the two things i have been on the fashion pages for are not wearing socks with black shoes while on holiday — sorry about that — and attending a banquet at the @entity167 , where in full white tie my shirt separated , and there was a rather embarrassing picture			2
' i am obviously not a great exemplar of fashion			0
' when i go shopping my wife does n’t allow me to look around the store at all , i am put in a changing room and things are passed to me like you would pass food to a prisoner			0

mr @entity2 catches attention for the *wrong* reason with his holiday sandals
the pm showcases battered old mules while *relaxing* with coffee in @entity21
his choice evokes memories of *sock-less* shoes *fiasco* in @entity121 , 2011
