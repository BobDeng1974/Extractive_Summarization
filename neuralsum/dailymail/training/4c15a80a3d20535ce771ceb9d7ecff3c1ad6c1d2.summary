by @entity0 if he thought he would get away with trashing a new set of cctv cameras , then this suspected vandal was wrong			0

@entity10 and @entity11 recently fixed four cameras along @entity13 near @entity14 after mounds of household waste were found dumped along the street			2

but the devices were vandalised *shortly* after they were installed
more than £ *900* of damage was caused when the cameras were shot at

images show him aiming what appears to be an air rifle at the cameras
