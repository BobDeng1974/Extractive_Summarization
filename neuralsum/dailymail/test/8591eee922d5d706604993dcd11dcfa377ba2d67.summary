hungry for power : @entity3 leader @entity2 @entity3 leader @entity2 last night admitted she understands concerns of @entity6 voters about her party being involved in a coalition government			1
the @entity10 first minister said : ‘ i understand how people south of the border think , “ oh my goodness how will it work ? it ’s a mess ”			0
’ she also suggested that @entity15 had been ‘ not unhelpful ’ to the @entity3 by gaining the party greater publicity			1
‘ at every @entity19 election i ’ve fought until this one , the biggest challenge that we ’ve had to overcome is being heard and being relevant			0
we do n’t have this problem this time , ’ she told @entity23			0
‘ the message it ’s given to people in @entity10 is – if this is the attention we get just from the @entity3 riding high in the polls , imagine how loud our voice would be if that was translated into seats			1
so in that respect i absolutely think it is not unhelpful			0
’ miss @entity2 ’s remarks came after she had insisted that she would put @entity33 into @entity34 even if @entity35 wins 40 fewer seats than the @entity37 in a hung @entity38			1
polls suggest the @entity3 is on the brink of a landslide on a scale unprecedented in modern @entity44 politics , winning as many as 50 of @entity10 ’s 59 commons seats			1
that would be all but certain to leave it holding the balance of power at @entity19 for the first time			0
in an interview with @entity53 , @entity51 insisted : ‘ even if the @entity37 are the largest party , if there is an @entity56 majority , my offer to @entity35 is to work together to keep the @entity37 out			0
’ asked whether mr @entity15 ’s party being ahead of @entity35 by ‘ ten , 20 , 30 , 40 ’ seats would have an impact on her decision , she said : ‘ governments in the @entity63 are about who can command a majority			0
' if there is an @entity56 majority , yes ... we would work with @entity35 to stop the @entity37 getting into @entity34			0
’ pledge : miss @entity2 ’s remarks came after she had insisted that she would put @entity33 ( right ) into @entity34 even if @entity35 wins 40 fewer seats than the @entity37 in a hung @entity38			1
left , @entity15 @entity35 has ruled out a coalition with the @entity3 but on more than 100 occasions in recent weeks senior figures have refused to rule out a less formal arrangement			2
most likely are vote - by - vote negotiations which would see the @entity3 agree to support a minority @entity35 government in key parliamentary votes , after seeking to extract concessions for @entity10			2
the prime minister called miss @entity2 ’s threat to prop up a weak @entity35 government ‘ frightening ’ and said it would lead to ‘ economic ruin ’			1
@entity85 said last night he would not support any deal with @entity35 that relies on it being propped up by the @entity3			2
the @entity87 leader said his first talks would be with the party with most seats – which most polls indicate will be the @entity37 .			2

leader said she understands concerns about @entity3 being part of coalition
miss @entity2 also suggested @entity80 had been ' not unhelpful ' to her party
polls indicate @entity3 is on the brink of a *historic* landside *victory* in election
