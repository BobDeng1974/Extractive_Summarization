@entity0 : the @entity2 is by far the biggest stage of all , it ’s @entity4 and @entity6 ’s last chance to shine @entity0 : @entity7 is the most underrated player in the @entity8 ... @entity10 fans should thank him and move on @entity0 : @entity11 must be adventurous and take the @entity2 by storm or go out in glory ... my starting xi for the opener with @entity16 is @entity17 morphing into @entity18 ? i sincerely hope not			1
two months ago i interviewed @entity17 , he was charming and knowledgeable and keen to listen to the views of me and other passionate @entity11 fans			2
the consensus then was that none of us expected @entity11 to win the @entity2 , but we would be happy to see us play with adventure			1
@entity17 promised us he would be taking risks and not holding his players back : ' we will be brave and we will believe in ourselves and we will risk defeat			1
' we wo n’t try and sneak our way through the games			0
with the type of players we ’ve got that would n’t suit us			0
' passing it on ? @entity17 will hope for a better @entity2 than @entity18 ( right ) endured in @entity35 in 2010 steady : @entity17 is more than capable of playing it safe , as shown by @entity11 's draw in @entity38 last year he even talked about the @entity40 way			1
well , for me , the @entity40 way means blowing teams away early on and putting on a show ; and to do that you need exciting , dynamic , imaginative players			0
the only two in the @entity11 squad who are available for the @entity16 game who have shown those qualities recently are @entity51 and @entity52			1
be true to your word @entity17 – be brave , as you promised me you would be two months ago			1
do n’t just go with @entity54 , put @entity51 and @entity52 in there as well , blow the @entity56 away early on			1
if you go for it , if you show adventure and take risks , you will be forgiven if it goes wrong			0
the future : the talented @entity51 ( left ) must be allowed to shine in @entity62 if you ’re cautious and fail – you will be judged a failure			2
we had to endure the pain of a gutless manager four years ago			0
@entity18 did n’t know his tactics , and he did n’t know his team			2
even worse , he lost control of his players mid-tournament			0
an astonishing display of terrible mismanagement , and he ’s lucky to get a chance to show he can do it with @entity75 at this @entity2			2
the @entity11 fans all know @entity52 and @entity51 should be in the team , and i suspect the @entity11 players know it too			1
wing wizard : @entity52 must have a big part to play for @entity11 at the @entity2 but does @entity17 know it ? i hope so , because if he tries to ' keep it tight ' against @entity16 , and go for a draw because ' a draw is a good result ' , i suspect @entity11 will suffer			1
we have flaws at the back that decent sides can and will exploit			0
the two recent friendlies prove my point : against @entity93 we played with adventure and it was great to watch			0
against @entity96 we were one - dimensional and functional			0
we drew both , but which gave @entity11 fans more satisfaction ? the first of course			0
if we are poor to watch , and go out in the group stage , @entity17 will prove himself to be a poor man ’s @entity18 , a label that should strike fear into the @entity11 manager ’s heart			1
@entity17 's @entity109 : @entity17 has depth in his squad , and @entity11 must be bold in @entity112			2

@entity17 promised he would play with adventure at the @entity2
will he keep his promise despite the tough group with @entity16 , @entity118 and @entity119 ?
@entity52 and @entity51 must start against @entity16 in @entity121
if @entity17 plays *defensively* and fails , he will just be another @entity18
