taxpayers wanting getting jobs not on a glorified jolly			0
’ mr @entity5 might not be a seasoned sportsman - despite being mistaken for @entity195 legend @entity17 during his trip of @entity8 - but he was able to show off his prowess on the football field yesterday as he joined in a game of 23 - a - side in the @entity32 slums			1
never one to find himself on the sidelines , the @entity4 mayor donned a charity t shirt and played football with children from the @entity148 project , an enterprise ran by a @entity95 charity			1

just two years ago , the field where the children played was covered in ' defecation and broken glass ' according to one cameraman who had visited and had to dodge puddles of sewage while the children ran in bare feet			0
now there was grass and the children - who would otherwise have been out gathering rubbish from the dumps surrounding their homes so their parents could sell the scraps - were able to play freely			0
unconcerned by the presence of mr @entity5 , @entity139 cricketer @entity138 or @entity248 winner @entity144 , the children rushed to grab cricket equipment from the trio			1

@entity8 journalists asked the mayor about his favourite sports			0
