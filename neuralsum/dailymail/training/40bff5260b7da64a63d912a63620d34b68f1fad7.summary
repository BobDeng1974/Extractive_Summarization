by @entity0 being held at gunpoint , pretending to be drunk so he can slip away from his minders and being woken up every day by hypnotic music and propaganda blaring out of speakers - these are just some of the everyday goings on witnessed by an @entity10 tourist in @entity11			1
@entity12 has had a 40 - year fascination with the communist country that is shut off from the world , crossing the border four times in four years in an attempt to see what life is really like for the country 's oppressed citizens			1
on one visit , he had a soldier 's rifle stuck in his back after he strayed from his tourist party - but escaped with some amazing and unsanctioned images			1
mr @entity12 , 54 , a business developer from @entity28 , told @entity29 the country wakes to eery , ear piercing music which is played through speakers in the street at 6am for about 20 minutes			1
and there 's no rest from @entity65 's message at work either as propaganda continues to play on more speakers throughout the day			0
one of mr @entity12 ’s most surreal moments came when he asked one of the minders about the early morning music and was met with an unexpected response			1
‘ he looked at me like i was crazy and said “ what music ? ” , ’ he said			2
‘ instead of being educated they are trained – they are not taught to be inquisitive like we are in the west			0
’ mr @entity12 also questioned why the buildings were not labelled with its function but with yet more propaganda about the @entity85 and his army			1
‘ their thinking is if i needed to know i would be told , ’ he explained			2
' the minder could n't understand why he would need to know such a thing			0
' @entity12 witnessed first hand the unequivocal power @entity11 leader @entity65 wields over the communist country @entity12 and a soldier at the @entity96 ( commonly known as the @entity97 ) , a buffer zone between @entity99 a propaganda painting shows what @entity11 girls dream of : missiles the dimly - lit hallway of a high school in @entity43			1
the country has a limited production of electricity , so buildings use as little energy as possible just like most people who visited @entity11 , mr @entity12 joined a travel group with two tour guides , or minders , who controlled everything that the tourists saw			1
it was a punishing itinerary , often as long as 14 hours a day of sightseeing in the hope visitors would be worn out and pass out in the evening , preventing them from sneaking out on their own			0
but mr @entity12 , who was an expert on the propaganda long before landing in the country , played the part of a ‘ useful idiot ’ and would regurgitate the country ’s brainwashed beliefs about their devotion to @entity65 and his army to the naive minders			1
once befriending his trusty travel guides with a tipple or two in the evening , mr @entity12 pretended to drunkenly stagger off to bed - but would in fact sneak off for up to hours at a time			1
' the whole country is a mass religious cult - it ’s very much like @entity138 , you do n’t choose where you live or travel outside of a 25 - 30km radius without a permit , ' he said			2
‘ i was never fearful as i thought the worst would that happen is i would get detained and deported			2
’ although mr @entity12 never got caught being out at night , there were a few occasions when he was found sneaking off during the day , including on a visit to the sacred mountain of @entity147 on his first trip			1
‘ the minders let us look around on our own for two hours only because we were so remote but i found military tunnels then next thing i know i had a gun in my back , ’ he said			1
‘ they marched me away from the area and took my photos but not my memory card so i was able to retrieve the photos back in @entity10 – this is one of the many ways the @entity11 are so inept			1
’ the portraits of @entity163 and @entity164 in a subway car in @entity43 a shrine celebrating the @entity65 family in the entrance of a building in @entity43			0
these shrines are present in practically every building , @entity12 says a propaganda painting showing @entity163 , the first leader of the @entity11 , his wife , @entity173 and and baby @entity164 , who would later succeed his father as @entity85 another daring daylight moment was when mr @entity12 managed to sneak away during a tour of a high school when he pretended that he urgently needed a toilet			1
' they let me go on my own but only because i had known them for a couple of weeks , ' he said			0
' i saw a propaganda mural in a high school floor , normally not accessible to tourists , that encourages students to study hard so they can have a chance to kill the enemies : the @entity52 and @entity53			2
' when he quickly dashed up the stairwell on his supposed bathroom break , he also saw a confronting poster of @entity11 students stabbing members of what represented the @entity52 army with a fountain pen			0
' occasionally when i would sneak away for three or four minutes during the day i would get caught but i would play the stupid tourist and act confused , ' he said			0
' i took about 10,000 photos on each trip and about 60 per cent of those were taken without permission			0
' he recalls not being allowed to take photos of an ox pulling a hoe on the street because it did n't symbolise an advanced country			0
mr @entity12 is satisfied with never being able to return to @entity11 after going public with his agenda because he feels he has all of the information he was hoping for			1
each trip took up to 12 months of preparation with his modes of transport varying from planes , a train and even one time by walking over the border from @entity222			0
he had to conceal his electronic devices including radio and tv receivers inside consumer products such as cameras , usb stick and @entity229 to ensure the equipment was n’t confiscated at the borders			0
@entity12 had to conceal his electronic devices including radio and tv receivers inside consumer products such as cameras , usb stick and @entity229 @entity12 snuck off to the hidden fifth staff floor of his hotel where the propaganda posters against westerners were bold and blatant propaganda blares through speakers in the streets all day long throughout @entity11 the mysteriously missing fifth floor of of the @entity242 @entity11 are taught not to think for themselves but follow the wise teachings of their king ‘ they say they are going to destroy the world but they do n’t have the capability , ’ he said			1
‘ you are not encouraged to think for yourself as they do n’t have a wide variety of information sources – you are to follow the wise teachings of the king			0
’ mr @entity12 could n't understand why the hotel he was staying in did n't have a fifth floor until he went snooping and found the floor , which was for staff only , adorned with propaganda posters filling the walls of the hallways			1
' a group of us were suspicious so we went to check it out one night , ' he said			0
' there was a poster saying : " get revenge 1,000 times against the @entity52 "			0
' mr @entity12 said it alarmed him how quickly he was conditioned to a conformist 's life			0
‘ it was really mind - blowing when i got to @entity222 and could walk wherever i wanted – i had n’t even realised what i had lost , ’ he said			2
‘ i gave into my freedoms without even realising – all of sudden there was a sense of colour , advertising and neon lights			0
’ mr @entity12 said the country ’s capital , @entity43 , is showcased as the perfect city and home to a utopian society			1
‘ you never saw anything bad because in the capital city @entity43 is where only the elite live who are part of @entity65 ’s army , ’ he said			2
‘ you never got to meet the true @entity11 you only ever saw them working in fields when you were on a train			2
’ the forced image was clearly working with a good portion of visitors as mr @entity12 was surprised by how many within the tour group believed the facade that was put on for the westerners			1
' i would say half of the tour group swallowed the propaganda , ' he said			0
' they became apologists for the most vile regime on the planet			0
' mr @entity12 described the country as a surreal fantasy land			2
‘ the tour is like a theme park where you are being taken to different propaganda rides , ’ he said			2
‘ the leaders are like cartoon characters always in the same clothes like @entity322			0
’ children dancing during an elementary school propaganda concert mr @entity12 's contraption : a coathanger used as a radio antenna the interior of a fertilizer factory , which is believed to be a covert chemical weapons plant performers dance during @entity11 's annual @entity333 or ' mass games ' celebration			1

@entity10 @entity12 visited @entity11 four times in four years under the guise of a tourist
being held at by gun point on his first trip did not stop the 54 - year - old from returning
he was an expert on the propaganda before landing in the country
@entity12 played the ‘ useful idiot ’ and would regurgitate the country ’s brain washed beliefs to the naive minders
he would sneak out at night when the minders thought he was *asleep*
@entity12 said many tourists believed the facade portrayed during the visit
