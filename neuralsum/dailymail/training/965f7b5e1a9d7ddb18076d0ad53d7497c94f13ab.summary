” @entity14 ' medals : the @entity10 medal , far right , was among the haul that sold for almost £ 100,000 at auction the episode for which @entity71 received the @entity10 was identical to one carried out by legendary wing commander @entity72 , who received the @entity73 for it			2
@entity71 ’ war is as astonishing as any of the aces who fought in the skies and he ranks in the top dozen for kills , but the speed with which he got was astonishing			2

they were the @entity89 , for those who baled out with a parachute ; the @entity98 , for those who baled out into water ; and the @entity97 , for those who came down in the desert and had to walk to friendly lines			1
mr @entity56 said : ' the remarkable wartime career of @entity1 epitomises the sustained gallantry displayed by the young pilots of @entity102			0
brave : @entity14 ( second left ) in front of his spitfire with fellow flyers			0
his @entity22 bomber was written off after the crash over the @entity110 desert in which he performed his heroics this time he made it back : @entity14 inspects damage to his spitfire following a sortie in december 1941 , shortly before the mission in the @entity22 , which did n't make it back ' it was a career encompassing several hundred combat sorties and the award of four decorations for gallantry - only 15 airmen received the combination of a dso and @entity43 with two bars in the 1939 - 45 @entity3			1
' a fighter ace three times over and , on account of having to take to his parachute on two occasions , once over water , he was also a member of the @entity89 , @entity97 and @entity131			1

109 over the @entity31 - as he was in the process of baling out his adversary overshot his crippled aircraft			1
memories : a sketch of @entity14 in his uniform , left , and right , with his wife on @entity145 family tradition : the much decorated @entity14 brothers @entity148 ( left ) and @entity149 ( centre ) with captain @entity14 ( right ) ' so @entity14 regained his cockpit and shot it down , before taking to his parachute in burning overalls , a remarkable act of gallantry witnessed by @entity33 troops on the ground			1
' a little over a year earlier , at the height of the @entity159 , flight lieutenant @entity72 had been awarded the @entity73 for an identical act of bravery , though on this occasion @entity14 was rewarded with an immediate dso			0
he was just 22 years of age			0
' @entity71 graduated from @entity164 , @entity165 , in 1939 and was posted to @entity166 where he was quickly in the thick of the action , shooting down enemy planes			0
history : a collection of mementos and photographs also included in the auction that belonged to @entity14			0
the entire lot fetched almost £ 100,000 @entity14 ' flying helmet with oxygen mask , which were also among the medals that were auctioned returning from his final sortie in @entity166 he had six inches shot off one of his propeller blades but landed the unsteady machine at the airfield			0
he was told that he could n’t take off with the propeller damage and the plane would have to be destroyed			0
but the plucky pilot had six inches taken off the other end of the propeller and made it back to @entity188			1
@entity71 then went to @entity189 and north @entity190 where he continued to shoot down enemy planes and survive close shaves himself			1

close call : @entity14 ' picture of a crashed spitfire at @entity200 air strip			0
like @entity14 did when battling the @entity203 , the pilot of this would have ejected war heroes : @entity1 ( second right ) with fellow flyers from the 185 squadron			0
the picture was also included in the auction relaxing : @entity14 ( right ) with fellow flyers from a bomber squadron he wrote : ' squirting 109 good and proper , got him smoking when a @entity211 ( @entity212 ) pulled up in front of me , so had to stop			1
shot the port wing off another at 7,000 , then later was bounced by a 109 who damaged my engine			0
' flew on a little way and then had to bale out			0
trouble with dinghy , picked up after 3 hours			0
moral - know your dinghy drill ! ' what he did n’t add was that the dingy operation was made difficult because he kept his left hand in the air throughout because he was wearing a watch his parents had bought him and did n’t want to break it			1
in may 1943 @entity14 was awarded his third dfc and returned home and saw no further action			0
