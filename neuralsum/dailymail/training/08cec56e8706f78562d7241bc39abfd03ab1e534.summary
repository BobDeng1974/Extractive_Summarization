i do feel emotional about this subject			0

a government source branded mr @entity18 a ‘ f * * * * * * c * * * ’ and a ‘ copper - bottomed s * * * ’ for demanding concessions from mr @entity83 and then voting against the watered down government motion			2

‘ i 've said already we believe @entity34 has spoken clearly on this issue and is unlikely to want to revisit it unless the circumstances change very significantly			0
’ mr @entity159 today said he was confident that @entity160 would back his plan for intervention in @entity9			2
