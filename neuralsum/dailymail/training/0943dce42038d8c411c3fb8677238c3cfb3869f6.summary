@entity0 gave best friend @entity1 a wedding to remember earlier this month by putting together an impressive video filled with famous face all claiming they have no idea who the groom is			1
after being selected as @entity1 's best man , @entity9 began putting together the comical clip with the likes of @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 all starring in cameo roles as they play along with @entity0 's joke			1
celebrities and sports stars past and present all pretend to rather rudely have never heard of @entity0 's friend despite different suggestions from the man asking the questions			2
@entity15 is first to feature in @entity0 's ' who is @entity1 ? ' best man video @entity29 , @entity16 and @entity30 ( right ) all claim to have never heard of king @entity9 poses with wife @entity33 during the wedding for @entity1 and @entity32 the former @entity36 international poses with @entity1 ( right ) for the groom 's special day @entity39 ( left ) @entity38 refuse to admit that they have ever heard of @entity0 's friend @entity15 is the first face to feature in the video , which was presumeably played before @entity0 's best man speech			1
with a completely straight face , the @entity45 boss says : ' good wishes , yes			0
but who is @entity1 ? he knows me , maybe , yes but i do n't him			0
' @entity1 's existence is then jokingly questioned by @entity51 and @entity52 hero @entity30 , who claims to have ' never heard of him ' despite the @entity9 's claims that he was ' in the boat in @entity55 when you won the gold medal			0
' @entity58 ( left ) claimed to have ' vaguely ' heard of @entity1 while @entity59 denied any knowledge @entity45 captain @entity61 looks bemused when asked to send best wishes to king @entity0 also managed to get football icons @entity13 ( left ) and @entity14 on board the award for most deadpan denial of the clip may go to @entity45 captain @entity61 , who looks complelety bemused when asked to send @entity1 his best wishes			1
@entity0 , who clearly spent months putting the video together , saves the best till last as football icons @entity13 and @entity14 appear to jump on the ' who is @entity1 ? ' bandwagon			1
' i do n't know him			0
i am the @entity1 , ' says @entity75 legend @entity13 before @entity14 simply adds ' @entity1 ? no. ' who the f * * k is @entity1 ? he is the groom with the greatest best man in the world , that ’s who he is			2
@entity0 ’s friend and business partner , @entity1 , got married at the weekend and the former @entity36 striker was there by his side			0
and just to prove how much of a great kind of guy he is , he made this brilliant video as part of his best man ’s speech to humiliate , and delight , the groom			0
when your friend gets @entity13 and @entity14 to appear in your wedding video you know you ’re doing something right with your life .			2
