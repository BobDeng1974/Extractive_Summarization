half a dozen piranhas have been pulled from a @entity2 sewer after homeowners complained about a fishy smell			1
workmen found the flesh - eating tropical fish in a drain leading to residents ' homes in @entity10 , @entity11 , yesterday			1
by the time they were fished out all of them though , they were dead			0
one of the piranhas found by workmen who were unblocking a sewer in @entity19 , @entity10 water bosses believe that someone had flushed the fish down the toilet when they got bored of keeping them as pets , and claimed they were the killer fish commonly found in @entity27 and not any cold - water species			1
in a statement , @entity29 said : ' it appears that a nearby resident had been disposing of dead fish , including piranhas , down the toilet and they had blocked the sewers ' @entity29 inspectors , @entity38 and @entity39 , who were sent to investigate the @entity10 blockage said : ' we 've certainly seen some weird things in the sewers over the years but we were a little shocked to remove piranhas			1
' you would n't think a fish of this size would fit down a toilet , but this is just one example of amazing things we find blocking the sewers			2
' locals now fear more of the fish - known for their razor sharp teeth , powerful jaws and a voracious appetite for meat - could still be alive in their sewerage system it worker @entity59 , 22 , from @entity19 , @entity11 , said : ' we could have a real - life ‘ @entity61 ' in @entity10 on our hands , you never know			1
' if they 've found some piranhas , it is surely feasible that there could be more still alive down there			1
' local butcher @entity70 , 56 , added : ' i might well be checking beneath the toilets seat before i go to the loo now			0
' @entity74 has lived on @entity75 for five years and has a drain right outside his house			2
he was forced to call @entity78 after the drain began to have a fishy whiff			1
( @entity81 picture ) @entity82 are known for their sharp teeth and a voracious appetite for meat hungry for meat : a piranha fish in the wild			1
they are usually found in the @entity91 and climes more tropical than the @entity2 mr @entity74 said : ' if someone called me up and told me they found pirahnas in the drain last week , i would have thought it was an @entity99 's joke			1
' as long as they are all dead i do n't mind , but i do n't like the though of the fish swimming around here - not when i have my pond in my garden			2
' workmen @entity38 and @entity39 , who went to investigate the smelly sewers for @entity29 , said many of the fish were several inches long			1
piranhas are omnivorous freshwater fish native to @entity27 rivers , but they have also been spotted in @entity113 and @entity114			1
they are known for their sharp teeth and a voracious appetite for meat			1
the exact number of piranha species is unknown , as new species continue to be discovered , but estimates range from 30 to 60			0
piranhas are normally 14cm to 26cm long , though some have been reported up to 43cm in length			2
attacks in the @entity91 basin have been on the increase in recent years			0
in 2011 , a drunk 18 - year - old man was attacked and killed in @entity131 , @entity132			0
in 2012 , a five - year - old @entity134 girl was attacked and killed by a shoal of piranhas , while recurring attacks in @entity138 in 2011 resulted in 100 people being injured			2
piranha attacks peak in the dry season when there is less food and the water levels are lower			2
fatalities are rare , with the majority of attacks taking the form of bites to the feet and hands			0
splashing tends to make piranhas more likely to attack , explaining why children are often injured during mass attacks of these creatures			2
mr @entity38 said : ' we 've certainly seen some weird things in the sewers over the years but we were just a bit shocked to remove piranhas			2
' i would n't have thought a fish of this size would fit down a toilet			2
' it is just one example of amazing things we find blocking the sewers , but there is a serious aspect to this as they had the potential to cause a lot of damage			0
' it is the second time sewers have been blocked in @entity11 this year by rubbish being pushed into toilets - after workers found several pairs of knickers blocking the drains in january			1
@entity29 said it was called to investigate the latest incident after people complained of a fishy smell coming into their homes			1
@entity29 today said blocked sewers are a serious issue			0
it said three - quarters of the 4,000 blockages in @entity11 last year were found to be caused by people misusing the sewer system			1
the problem costs @entity29 more than £ 10 million per year clearing products and mess from its network			0
@entity199 , customer operations manager for @entity29 , said : ' having sewage flooding inside your home due to sewers being blocked is one of the most horrible things that can happen to you , and we do n't want our customers to suffer in this way			0
' the drains that take waste water away from your home are only a few inches wide and are only meant to take water , toilet roll and human waste - certainly not piranhas or pants			1
' toilet roll is meant to break down when it gets wet so it washes easily through the system			0
that 's not the case with things like large tropical fish which can get stuck in smaller drains			0
' these sewer blockages , if not identified and cleared , can lead to sewers backing up and overflowing into people 's homes and gardens			0
' and it 's not necessarily the people who put the wrong things down the toilet that are affected			0
' the blockage can happen further down the street , so what you do in your home can be causing a problem for your neighbours			0
' we are spending millions of pounds every year sending teams into sewers with jetting equipment and sometimes even spades to dig out these blockages			0
' we ask people to get themselves a bin in their bathroom and use that rather than the toilet			0
