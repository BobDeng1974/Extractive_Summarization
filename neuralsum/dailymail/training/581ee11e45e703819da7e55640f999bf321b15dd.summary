by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ @entity2 met up with @entity4 new boy @entity3 as the pair returned to training in the @entity8 capital			1
@entity3 joined the @entity10 champions from @entity11 for £ 63million after impressing at the @entity12 in @entity13 , where he won the @entity14 for being top scorer at the tournament			1
and after a well - earned break the @entity18 star reported for training at the club ’s @entity20 to and joined up with his new team - mates			2
if @entity3 , @entity2 and @entity38 do start together then it will be one of the most expensive front lines ever assembled with a combined transfer value of £ 230m			1
@entity4 have not had the best pre-season so far , losing 3 - 1 to @entity47 in the @entity48 and boss @entity49 said : ' we were not happy with the defeat ( by @entity47 ) ; we did n’t play well but the @entity39 will be a completely different game			1
' we ca n’t be ready at this stage , because some of the squad have only been training for a week			0
plus the team are n’t used to playing without @entity2 and other players , so what happened ( against @entity47 ) is to be expected			1
we have to continue to prepare ourselves			0
eyes on the ball : @entity3 keeps his focus during training with his new team - mates between the sticks : new signing @entity64 poses with @entity4 boss @entity49 at @entity29 all smiles : @entity33 , @entity3 and @entity34 do their exercises during training running men : @entity2 , @entity33 , @entity3 and @entity34 go through their paces in training out on his own : world player of the year @entity2 puts in a bit of solitary work @entity78 's dreams are real ' @entity2 ’s determined to play in the @entity39 , that ’s why i gave him 20 minutes			1
he needs another week to get up to speed with the team			0
i think he ’ll be fit ( for the @entity39 )			2
there ’s no reason to worry about his fitness ; we ’ll prepare him well and there ’s no cause for concern			0
' @entity3 has been training in @entity29 and he could be ready to play in the @entity39 too			2
i think all the players will be ready			0
we only have a week , which is n’t long , but we ’ll prepare well			0
