the @entity0 is the limit for @entity2 and @entity4 boxing , according to promoter @entity5 - all thanks to the @entity9 champion ’s vast potential			1
@entity2 ’s @entity11 world middleweight title eliminator against @entity13 ’s @entity12 was on tuesday confirmed for @entity15 ’s @entity14 on november 15 , having been rescheduled from its original date last august			1
the @entity18 bill has an extra-polished sheen to it , too , as @entity5 has added @entity4 @entity22 medallist @entity21 to the card , while the promoter hopes former @entity25 amateur champion @entity24 will also feature in his first home pro bout			1
@entity2 ( to the right of @entity5 , centre ) to fight @entity12 on november 15 the august show had been postponed due to the shooting of @entity2 ’s trainer @entity31 in @entity32 ( now recovering from his injuries ) , and , despite having sold - out @entity15 ’s 2,000 - capacity @entity35 in a matter of minutes , @entity2 ’s career was in danger of going off the rails and losing a much - needed momentum boost			1
but while domestic battles between rivals @entity43 and @entity44 , and @entity45 and @entity46 , on the new undercard have @entity4 fight fans salivating , only @entity2 had the pulling power to lure @entity18 back into the mix , according to @entity5 , who has re-fixed the show for the @entity14 , which will have a 6,000 capacity as his @entity53 promotional outfit dip their toe into the @entity4 market			1
‘ he ’s the reason why we ’re here , ’ said @entity5 of three - time world - title challenger @entity2			2
‘ no disrespect to @entity61 , @entity62 and those guys , we could n’t run a @entity0 date with those guys alone on the bill			0
they ’re a brilliant support cast , they make the show , but you need the headline act , so if he loses , a lot hinges for @entity4 boxing on his performance and result			0
’ @entity74 ( right ) of @entity76 exchange punches with @entity2 ( left ) during the middleweight fight in @entity78 the eagerness to please the broadcaster is down to the fact that tv networks remain the main paymasters behind big fight nights			2
@entity2 , @entity85 - born with strong @entity87 roots , turned down @entity0 ’s suggestion to stage the fight in the city of his birth , favouring a return to the @entity4 capital			2
‘ i ’m proud to be bringing it back here , but , also , you feel that it ’s not just my career riding on it			0
if i can go on and do well and bring more big nights back here , other [ @entity102 ] lads can benefit from it , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s a good weight on my shoulders , not a heavy one			0
’ the @entity11 world middleweight title eliminator will be aired on @entity18 between @entity2 and @entity12 having struggled to shake off his ring rust in a keep - busy win over @entity110 @entity74 last month , @entity2 is also keen to prove he still belongs at world level against 27 - year - old @entity12			1
‘ this is the acid test			0
if i beat this guy and look really good doing it , i know that ’s me on the way to becoming world champion , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ if i perform like i know i can , i probably will knock him out			0
