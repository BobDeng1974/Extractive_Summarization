smiling : @entity0 , who boasted her two favourite things were ' money and sex ' , was cleared of running a £ 500,000 prostitution racket yesterday as a woman whose career has long revolved around her two favourite things – money and sex – @entity0 knows the value of appearance			1
during her two - week stint at @entity12 , where she was accused of controlling a £ 500,000 - a - year high - class prostitution ring , the 40 - year - old established something of a routine			1
each morning , she would walk up the court steps dressed in tracksuit bottoms and a loose jumper , make - up free face largely hidden beneath a pair of over-sized sunglasses			0
once inside , the seven - months pregnant mother - of - two would head to the lavatories where she would slip into a sophisticated black dress and apply her make up			2
‘ i do n’t need to impress them [ the photographers waiting outside ] , ’ she declared as she sat outside the courtroom one morning			1
the meaning of this pronouncement was clear – the only people @entity0 wanted to make a positive impression on were judge and jury			1
it must have worked , for yesterday @entity0 was cleared of controlling prostitution for gain and of converting criminal property ( more commonly known as money laundering ) between december 2008 and july 2011			1
she raised her trembling hands to her mouth and burst into tears as the verdict was read out			0
it leaves her free , if she chooses , to resume business			0
prostitution is not illegal , but controlling prostitutes is and there is no doubt that @entity0 has reaped the benefits of a lucrative trade , albeit working within the law			1
she was cleared after the jury heard that she did not control the girls who worked at @entity54 with an iron fist , but instead acted as their agent , taking only a commission payment			1
the girls , she said , were her friends			0
one is godmother to her children – she has two daughters aged eight and nine – and she is about to be maid of honour to another			2
so who is @entity0 , and what took a @entity69 wardrobe assistant from backstage at @entity71 to the top of a lucrative , but decidedly less salubrious industry , earning enough money to put her daughters through private school in @entity77 ? @entity0 – or @entity78 as she was known to @entity54 ’s clients – was born in @entity80 , @entity81 , in 1972			1
her mother @entity82 , 56 , was an insurance clerk			0
no father ’s name was listed on her birth certificate			0
at her home in @entity88 yesterday , mrs @entity0 said only that she was ‘ embarrassed ’ by her daughter ’s predicament			1
the young @entity0 spent her formative years in @entity91 with grandparents @entity92 and @entity94 , only returning to @entity81 at the age of 12			1
after leaving school , she began work as a wardrobe assistant			2
voyeurism : at @entity12 ( pictured ) , @entity100 also admitted to making or possessing 61 indecent photographs and distributing one image of children between four and ten - years - old this , however , was not enough for a young woman with pound signs in her eyes			2
her ‘ hostess skills ’ were honed at the @entity108 , in @entity109 , a venue owned by vice king @entity111 – once described as @entity113 ’s biggest pimp – who served a prison sentence for vat fraud			1
@entity0 claims she left the club because she ‘ got sick of the drinking ’ , telling jurors she had to ‘ drink champagne and only champagne ’ from 9pm to 2am every day			1
the enterprising @entity0 used her ‘ experience ’ as a stepping stone , working independently as an escort before setting up @entity54			1
the picture she painted in court could not have been further removed from the gritty underbelly of the vice industry			0
@entity54 , she said , was a group enterprise , formed with five other women over a bottle of @entity133 at the upmarket department store @entity134			0
it was , apparently , to be a business where ‘ women were in control ’			1
asked why she began in the trade , she declared : ‘ i ’ve been asked this question many times and the way i answer it is , my two favourite things in the world are money and sex			1
i absolutely love both of them , and a job that allows me to put them both together , why would n’t i ? ’ the glamorous brunette was once a wardrobe assistant backstage at @entity71 listening to @entity152 , the world of sex for sale appears to be one long merry - go - round of worldwide travel – @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 – high - class hotels and money			1
as for the clients , @entity0 declared them ‘ a class of gentlemen i had never met before ’			1
exactly what class of gentlemen is drawn to an agency offering ‘ busty @entity81 escorts ’ who provide everything from ‘ girlfriend experience to porn star experience ’ ? well , ones that can afford up to £ 500 for an hour or £ 2,500 for a 14 - hour overnight stay with the girl of their choice			1
by 2003 @entity152 ’s involvement with the trade appears to have been more administrative			0
she was pregnant with her first girl , now nine , and began running the agency from her new home in @entity184			2
she had a second daughter a year later and by 2008 she was the sole founding member of @entity54 – and presumably the sole beneficiary of whatever was left , after advertising costs , of the 30 per cent commission each girl handed over			2
in court it was said @entity152 earned £ 90,000 in the first six months of 2011 alone			0
her business acumen , if one can call it that , appears to come from the most unlikely source			2
‘ let ’s just say that i have a lot of respect for @entity203 ’s ethos of “ @entity204 ” , ’ she declared when being quizzed about her pricing policy on an internet forum last year			2
‘ i think that it ’s a good way for any business to behave			2
’ quite what solidly respectable @entity203 would make of her use of its phrase is open to conjecture			0
so what of @entity215 ’s daughters ? their birth certificates , like their mother ’s , have a blank space where a father ’s name should be			0
@entity0 did marry , in 1998 at @entity222 to a 25 - year - old @entity224 student			2
curiously , however , friends knew nothing of the marriage and say he is gay			0
it ended in divorce last year , on the basis that they had lived apart for more than five years			0
he says only ‘ it was a long time ago ’			2
@entity0 was arrested by @entity235 , who had been investigating sex trafficking			1
she did not , it should be made clear , take part in trafficking , but the investigation led to her because she is believed to have unknowingly acted as agent for someone who had been trafficked			0
until then , she had rented the £ 1,500 - a - month home in a wealthy suburb of @entity184			0
a neighbour said : ‘ everybody in the square was gossiping about what she did for a living			0
she always walked very tall and proud , was well - spoken and smartly dressed – but never extravagantly			0
her fashion sense certainly never gave any indication of what she did for a living			0
’ since her arrest , @entity0 has been living in a modern four - bedroom property , complete with solar panels , perched on a hilltop in a village near @entity260 , @entity261 , with her 29 - year - old former next - door neighbour @entity262			1
a local said : ‘ we thought there was something a bit odd about the pair of them			0
they never seemed to go anywhere and hardly anyone ever seemed to visit them			0
they had two children with them			0
‘ @entity0 claimed to be running a firm which can push a firm up the internet search listings			1
‘ we had n’t seen @entity0 for a few days and now we know why			1

@entity0 , who boasted her two favourite things were ‘ money and sex ’ , was said to have used the cash to send her two children to private school
the pregnant former call girl was cleared of controlling prostitution for gain after saying she was no more than an ' agent for the escorts '
