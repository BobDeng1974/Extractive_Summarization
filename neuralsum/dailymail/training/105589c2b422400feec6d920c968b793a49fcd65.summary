by @entity0 published : 16:36 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 16:39 est , 2 may 2013 an @entity2 family who became desperately ill after unknowingly buying a former meth lab last summer has finally settled with @entity5 , which sold them the property			1
@entity8 and @entity9 , who moved into the property with their infant son last year , are also working with lawmakers to require sellers to disclose if a home has been tested for contamination			2
the couple bought the home through @entity18 , a listing service for @entity5 , the government - sponsored housing organization			1
@entity5 has now said it will review its selling policies			1
' after speaking to the @entity9 and hearing their concerns first hand we were able to work closely together and come to a mutually agreeable resolution , ' the company said , @entity23 reported			0
relief : @entity8 and @entity9 have finally settled with @entity5 , which last year sold them a foreclosed home which had previously been a meth lab , making them desperately ill ' we will continue to review and update our policies to protect our buyers and their confidence in @entity18 homes			1
' the settlement amount has not been disclosed			0
the couple has now moved 25 miles from the original property in @entity41			0
the bought the first home for just $ 36,500 - but had no idea about its history			1
within days of moving into the property with their infant son , @entity46 , they began experiencing breathing problems and , after weeks , they were struck with agonizing mouth sores , nose bleeds and migraines			1
more than they bargained for : the @entity41 , @entity2 house on @entity53 was visibly in need of repair but methamphetamine toxins are invisible and they had no idea of the property 's history ' we mostly experienced extreme dry mouth and had mouth sores , making it extremely painful to even drink water , ' mr @entity9 told @entity65 at the time			1
they were about to call the doctor when a neighbour revealed the truth about the home 's previous tenants and just as quickly as they had taken ill , their dream purchase became their nightmare			1
they bought a $ 50 testing kit and found that the house on 2427 @entity53 was not only a meth lab but that its contamination level was nearly 80 times higher than the @entity81 limit			0
the couple promptly moved in with relatives before renting another property nearby , and now lament that they are facing financial ruin			0
mr and mrs @entity86 , the owner of a coffee house and an @entity89 nurse , had bought the home from @entity5 for what they considered a steal , even though they knew it needed work			1
superficial : before disaster struck , @entity9 and his two - year - old son @entity46 painted the walls of their new home thinking they only had to make minor repairs and give the house a little love to resurrect it good as new ? the @entity9 spent about $ 5,000 on upgrading rooms like the bathroom before discovering the shocking news about their beloved home decline : @entity86 , an @entity89 nurse , started experiencing breathing problems before her husband started suffering from migraines and nosebleeds and @entity46 developed mouth sores ' we said , " it needs a little bit of love , but it 's got good bones , " ' @entity9 told @entity119			1
' we just had no idea that those bones were poisonous - the walls were poisoning us			2
' after learning of its former use as a meth lab , they contacted @entity5 to find out why they had not been told			2
they learned the local authorities had not contacted the @entity81 , as is customary , as there had not been any recent drug - related enforcement actions at the home , @entity23 reported			2
@entity5 said it encourages buyers to check federal agency listings kept about meth labs , but the @entity9 said the organisation only encouraged them to test how structurally secure the home was			1
the couple delivered a petition to @entity5 's @entity139 offices at the end of the year to ask the organisation to require testing of homes for meth residue before they are sold			1
unaware : within days of moving in , @entity8 started developing breathing problems and just weeks later , the couple 's son @entity46 , started getting mouth sores and was unable to drink water kicked out : a neighbour told them the home had been a meth lab and the couple moved out though in 23 states , including @entity2 , laws require sellers to disclose if a property was ever used as a clandestine drug laboratory , @entity5 claims it had no idea of the @entity41 house 's history			1
@entity5 spokesman @entity163 told @entity23 : ' we certainly empathize with the situation , but we had no prior information about the way the home had been used			2
if we had , of course , we would have disclosed it			0
' @entity170 of @entity171 admitted that even with disclosure laws , only one in ten labs are busted and since the toxins are invisible ' you do n't always see the meth residue			0
' ' it 's extremely dangerous stuff , ' he said of methamphetamine			0
he also explained that information regarding the history of a property routinely falls through the cracks by the time the bank or government agency has reached the point of foreclosure			0
trouble : the local authority did not alert the @entity81 about the meth lab , like that pictured , before the house was sold as there had been no recent law enforcement action at the house the @entity9 delivered a petition to @entity5 headquarters demanding they take more responsibility according to mr @entity170 he receives calls from people in exactly the same position as the @entity9 every three to five minutes and recently heard from a man in @entity205 who unknowingly bought a contaminated home that killed his 14 - year - old daughter after two years			2
but there is hope : @entity211 state representative @entity210 has introduced house bill 3499 , which asks for foreclosed or auctioned homes to be tested for methamphetamine - or to let would - be owners know the property has not yet been tested			0
' a lot of people do n't think about it , ' @entity210 told @entity23			0
' if you buy a home , it 's not something that comes to the forefront			2
you do n't necessarily think about methamphetamine			0
' she added that she hopes the meth test will become as standard as the lead and mold tests in the state			0
she said around 800 homes scheduled for auction currently have no information about their history .			0

@entity237 suffered nose bleeds , breathing problems , migraines and mouth sores before they discovered the shocking truth from a neighbor
@entity5 said it had no idea of the home 's history but that it would now review its selling policies
