the waiting game came to an end for @entity3 supporters at @entity4 in may			1
@entity6 's extra-time goal saw the @entity7 lift their first trophy since 2005			1
thousands of supporters lined the streets of @entity11 to hail @entity13 's heroes 24 hours later during a triumphant open - top bus parade			2
there was a feeling of adulation on @entity18 that sunday as fans celebrated the end of their much - hyped trophy drought , but there was another strong vibe in the air that day			1
@entity6 is mobbed by his @entity3 team - mates after scoring the winner against @entity27 in the @entity29 final the streets of @entity11 are lined by @entity3 fans as they celebrate their club 's @entity29 triumph in 2014 a sense that this was merely the beginning ; the start of a period of dominance from another @entity13 - led @entity3 team			1
but five months later , @entity40 are again being asked to be patient			2
everything is in place for a prosperous future at the @entity44			0
the club 's self - sustainable financial structure is starting to have a significant impact in the new world of @entity49			1
but speaking ahead of thursday 's @entity51 , chief executive @entity50 remained cautious			1
speaking ahead of @entity3 's @entity51 , @entity50 said the club are aiming to be held in the same esteem as @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 and the rest of @entity59 's elite ' where we are currently is off the shoulder of the world 's top teams			1
i think the best teams in the world are in @entity59 and you think about the great names in world football like @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 - i do n't think we 're at that level yet but that 's where we 're aiming to get to , ' said the @entity7 supremo			1
' it 's one thing to say that and it 's another thing to be able to deliver it			0
it has been incredibly frustrating not being able to be where we want to be these last few years , so winning the @entity29 was a fantastic moment			1
' ( but ) i do n't come out of that feeling satisfied like we 've achieved what we need to achieve			0
the hunger for success is immediate			0
the moment you get away from that euphoria of the moment , the next question is , " how do we have more of that ? " @entity91 and @entity92 arrived at @entity3 in the summer for a combined fee of £ 46million ' that 's what everybody at this club is focused on			1
there 's no satisfaction in it - it 's what do we do now			0
' when @entity50 ' most recent comments were issued earlier this week , it must have felt like @entity104 for some fans ; it 's a message @entity3 supporters have become accustomed to in recent years			1
the message that the club are working hard to enter @entity59 's elite , but still not quite there			1
recent big - money signings such as @entity112 , @entity92 and @entity91 have helped placate some disgruntled fans			0
but others remain doubtful that their club can replicate @entity13 's glory years			1
here , @entity117 takes you on a trip down memory lane , looking at some of @entity50 ' previous soundbites - and how they all have a similar theme : patience			1
@entity112 joined the @entity7 for a club record fee in the summer of 2013 , but has failed to hit his top form on the day @entity3 were due to meet @entity127 in the @entity128 final - which they lost - @entity50 spoke of the sacrifices the club were making to ensure @entity3 's future success			1
february 2011 : ' some of the decisions we need to make looking forward will impact the manager adversely in the short term , but 10 , 15 even 20 years from now , the decisions will make sure this club moves forward			1
' winning is important , but it 's not the end objective of everything , the end objective is the emotional connection our fans have with this club			1
the end objective is the creation of pride , one of the aspects that creates pride is winning trophies and that 's essential for a club our size , but the way we conduct ourselves , the way we play , all these things are important			2
' it 's right and proper that we are expected to win trophies regularly , and i welcome that pressure , that kind of pressure is good			0
' @entity3 were beaten by @entity127 in the 2011 league cup final after @entity168 scored the winner in the aftermath of @entity3 's infamous 8 - 2 loss at @entity172 , @entity50 insisted the club would emerge stronger after a difficult few months which saw @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 quit the club			1
the belief that better days were ahead was a key theme			0
september 2011 : ' we are going through a difficult period like all clubs do , it 's a cycle and we will work our way out of it			0
we understand some of the emotions the fans have been through , we understand the expectations are high and we share those expectations , that 's where we are in the game - other clubs would be delighted to be in our overall position			0
' we are in a healthy and strong position , we 've had 14 years of success in the @entity198			2
when i came in two - and - a - half years ago i was told we were falling behind @entity200 and @entity201			2
the reality is we are in a strong position to look forward with confidence and standing on our own two feet , with a strong sustainable model built around youth development ; we 've got strong youth players coming through - not just @entity208			0
@entity13 ca n't bring himself to watch the game as @entity3 are humiliated by @entity172 the @entity211 outfit ran out 8 - 2 winners against @entity3			1
it was one of the club 's worst - ever defeats ' our transfer strategy remains developing young players and turning them into star players , but we have sprinkled that with experienced players			2
it 'll take a bit of time for those players to settle but we 'll have a strong squad			0
you ca n't replace a @entity174 , one of the best players in the world and there 's not an unlimited number of those			0
' we are focused to continue to move forward as a club			2
if we spent every single penny we had in every transfer window , we would end up making some bad decisions			0
' ahead of the 2012 season , @entity50 again spoke about the club 's ability to compete with @entity59 's elite clubs … in the future , of course			1
june 2012 : ' we want to win major competitions			0
we want to win the @entity242			0
we want to compete to win the @entity198			0
' my message to our fans is that we are doing everything in our power to make sure that @entity3 can challenge for trophies next year			1
that is what this summer is about and that is what we are focused on for next year			0
' we have a good team , we have a good young core of players and we need everybody involved to have belief so that we can push forward into next year and make a run at the @entity242 trophy and for the @entity198			2
we believe we can do that			0
' @entity50 has spoken about @entity3 's ability to compete with some of @entity59 's best clubs , albeit in the future and there was more of the same from @entity50 five months later			1
november 2012 : ' as we look to the next two , three years we will have an outstanding platform on which to compete with any club in the world			1
now we are in that stadium , the first part of our vision has been realised			0
now we are at the stage where some of the commercial deals that were tied into the construction of the stadium , and enabled us to take that first big step , will be renegotiated			0
when that happens , we will take the second big step forward and that will be comparable in magnitude to moving to the stadium itself			0
' at times it 's been a challenging project , but we will have catapulted ourselves into the elite clubs on the @entity288 scale and that , for us , has been what the last 10 years has been about			2
' very clearly , it will push the club forward and put us into the top five clubs in the world in revenue terms , which will be a fantastic position to be in			2
' the @entity3 board addresses its audience at the @entity298 at the @entity44 still without a trophy , @entity50 returned with a familiar message at the end of the 2012/13 season			1
june 2013 : ' so obviously we have come to the end of the season and in the end we finished with 73 points and in fourth place which i would say was necessary for us			0
we want to be competing at the top of the game and in order to do that you have to be in the @entity198			0
so we are pleased to have qualified , or at least , for the qualification games			0
' but it is not ultimately where we want to be with moving the club forward			2
we want to be a club that is competing at the very top end of the game and that means competing to win the @entity242 and competing to win the @entity198			2
on that basis , we are not where we want to be yet			0
' i think its not idle ambition when we talk about wanting to get there			0
i think we have a very solid plan that will give us the ability to be able to compete at that level provided we do things well			2
the critical thing now as we look ahead over the next season and the season after is our developing financial capability which will give us a lot more options than in recent years			2
' we wait with baited breath to see what @entity50 plans to say at thursday 's agm			1
more of the same , perhaps ? @entity208 reflects on @entity3 's defeat at @entity340 - they are already nine points behind their rivals			1

@entity3 to hold their @entity51 later on thursday
speaking earlier this week , chief executive @entity50 remained cautious
he wants club to reach level of @entity54 , @entity56 and @entity55
@entity3 won first trophy in nine years after beating @entity27 in @entity29 final
