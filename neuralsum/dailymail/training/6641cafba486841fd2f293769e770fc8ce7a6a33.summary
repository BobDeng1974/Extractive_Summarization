doctor sleep : @entity2 has revealed that the sequel to @entity5 will be published next september the new book will focus on @entity9 , now in adulthood , who works as a hospice worker and helps his patients die painlessly while also fighting a group of psychic vampires			1
one of @entity2 's most loved works , @entity5 has sold more than a million copies since it was first published in 1977			2
three years later it was adapted into a @entity26 film , which was produced and directed by the @entity27 and starred @entity28			2
the @entity5 told the story of the @entity9 family , who moved to the @entity5 in the @entity32 mountains , where father @entity28 is to act as caretaker over a long winter			1
here 's @entity34 : @entity28 terrified film fans as a crazed writer in 1980 's @entity5 @entity37 , a writer who was played by @entity28 in the film , then becomes possessed by the evil spirits in the hotel and attacks his family			2
but the young @entity9 , whose psychic abilities strengthened the hotel 's ghosts , eventually manages to escape with his mother @entity45			1

lost in a maze : @entity28 's crazed character comes to a frosty end in the film , but will he back for the prequel no word yet on when @entity7 will be turned into a movie			0
@entity2 famously disliked the big screen version of @entity5 , believing too much of the supernatural element was cut from his book			0
he said at the time : ' parts of the film are chilling , charged with a relentlessly claustrophobic terror , but others fall flat			0
not that religion has to be involved in horror , but a visceral skeptic such as @entity27 just could n't grasp the sheer inhuman evil of @entity5			0
' so he looked , instead , for evil in the characters and made the film into a domestic tragedy with only vaguely supernatural overtones			2
that was the basic flaw : because he could n't believe , he could n't make the film believable to others			0
new blood : @entity97 screenwriter @entity96 has been approached to tackle the daunting prequel ' what 's basically wrong with @entity27 's version of @entity5 is that it 's a film by a man who thinks too much and feels too little ; and that 's why , for all its virtuoso effects , it never gets you by the throat and hangs on the way real horror should			0
' video : @entity2 gave a surprise reading from @entity7 at @entity112 last year			0
