she was the nerdy feminist with an ‘ awful haircut ’ and ‘ hideous @entity3 bottle glasses ’			2
he was a ‘ @entity5 ’ of a man with a six - inch beard who towered over everyone he met			1
but this is this is how one of @entity14 ’s greatest political dynasties began , according to the screenplay of @entity16 , about the early life of @entity18			1
the script , a copy of which has been shown to @entity22 by a @entity24 source , gives a riveting fictional account of how the former first lady and future presidential candidate met husband @entity28 - set to the soundtrack of @entity30 ’s you ’re so vain			1
the way we were : @entity28 and @entity18 pictured in their younger years after meeting at @entity35 in 1972 hot politics : the script rather ungallanty says ' she ¿ s the valedictorian of the ' look - like - s * * * school of feminism ¿ there is romance and sex including one scene in which the pair ‘ devour ’ each other			1
there is the ambition of the potential 2016 presidential candidate who was chosen in her 20s to serve on the @entity52 which looked into impeaching president @entity53			1
but above all there is the story of somebody who refuses to let anything get in her way of getting to the top - man or woman			1
@entity22 has been told by sources that the script has not yet received financial backing and is being extensively rewritten			2
it is based on real events but screenwriter @entity66 , a @entity67 who was living in @entity69 at the time he wrote it , has taken artistic licence when it comes to dialogue			1
love story : the screenplay @entity75 tells how former @entity14 secretary of state @entity18 met husband , former president @entity77 mr @entity66 said the script was intended to show the ‘ journey of a person who is faced with the impossible choice of her career ambitions and personal desires ’			1
he said : ‘ this is a story about a woman who was a political rock star and had as bright a future coming out of @entity87 as @entity28 if not more			2
‘ and the story is about someone who is so assured of her destiny in @entity91 until she meets the one person in the world who makes her make this the most impossible dilemma			2
‘ and she faces this difficult choice when she is 26 in 1974 , in an era when most women realize that they can not have both a career and a family			2
’ as a result , the story is as much about the relationship between mr @entity77 and mrs @entity18 , whose maiden name is @entity75 , as it is about her ascent to the @entity106			2
beauty : @entity18 , pictured as a student in 1969 , several years before she met her husband @entity28 driven : @entity18 , center , with fellow students at @entity112 in 1969 , is described as having ' hideous @entity3 bottle glasses ' in the screenplay do n't mess : in the script , @entity18 decides to stop wearing skirts and wears pant suits to be taken more seriously the script details how the pair met at @entity121 in 1972 in the law school library where she is tutoring a young @entity123 , who would go on to be @entity124 in her husband ’s administration			1
mrs @entity18 is described as a ‘ blonde girl whose face is hidden behind an awful haircut and a hideous pair of coke - bottle glasses ’			1
it reads : ‘ her tie - dyed t - shirt has a faded “ @entity138 ” on it			1
she ’s the valedictorian of the ' look - like - s * * * school of feminism			1
’ mr @entity77 is a ‘ a @entity5 of a man slows down to watch her			2
he has a full mane and a six - inch beard			1
’ the then miss @entity75 notices him gazing at her , slams her book shut and storms up to him to demand an explanation			2
her ‘ piercing gaze ’ leaves mr @entity77 speechless until the credits roll , set to the music of @entity30 ’s you ’re so vain			2
over the 118 pages the script details how the pair then drift apart and get back together until 1974 when she joins in him @entity153 where he is running for a seat in the @entity106 - having effectively chosen his career over hers			1
work in progress : the screenplay @entity75 which focuses on the love story of @entity28 and @entity18 has been written by @entity66 on her journey she encounters all the travails of being a woman in a man ’s world in the 1970s			1
mrs @entity18 tells a friend that her friend @entity166 , who would go on to her her husband ’s chief of staff , thinks she should change her appearance to give herself ‘ torpedo titties ’ to make herself more appealing			2
she later decides to stop wearing skirts and wears pant suits to be taken more seriously			2
mr @entity77 ’s mother @entity174 , however , disapproves of her attire so much that she gives her a tight - fitting blue dress to wear during a family visit			1
sexism even comes from mr @entity77 ’s own family in the form of his half - brother @entity181 , who raises a laugh at a family gathering with the joke : ‘ who do you think f * * * * * more women ? @entity28 or @entity18 ? ’ the script describes how mrs @entity18 is outraged when her husband is first offered the job on the @entity52 by chairman @entity191 instead of her			1

mr @entity77 first proposes in 1972 when mrs @entity18 is 26 and working for the @entity220 , whilst he is assistant professor of law at the @entity221			1
in true @entity77 style , he does it rather casually as the resignation of vice president @entity225 plays on a tv in the background			1
mr @entity66 writes that mrs @entity18 ‘ wanted this for so long and it ’s finally happening ’ but does not seem to take it seriously or give him an answer			1
he later proposes again in dramatic fashion as he is about to get on a plane but she can not say yes , even when he puts the ring in front of her finger			0
mr @entity66 writes : ‘ she shakes , unable to speak			1
her world crumbles in the most wonderful yet devastating way			0
‘ her heart wants to say yes			0
but her mind calculates the ramifications			0
’ mr @entity66 also writes of when they have sex mr @entity77 ‘ eyes her with such intensity that she feels naked , vulnerable , and aroused all at once ’			1
power couple : @entity28 and @entity18 on their wedding day , october 11 , 1975 in @entity250 , @entity153 he writes : ‘ a seductive , penetrating gaze that makes her want to explode with pent - up desires			1
‘ he grabs her wrists and pins her against the wall			0
feeling so wonderfully submissive to his primal , masculine needs			0
‘ @entity28 tears off the buttons of her blouse			0
as he buries his head into her cleavage ... ’ their attempt to have sex ends in a comic note when they check their voicemail messages which include the call from mr @entity191 - sparking a row which ends the liaison			1
the bulk of the script is about mrs @entity18 ’s time on the @entity277 and how she wins the approval of older , male colleagues by being brilliant at her job			0
she is assigned to work with @entity281 , a 28 - year - old rising star who mr @entity66 describes as having ‘ golden hair , dashing good looks , and tall and muscular frame			1
he won the genetic lottery			0
’ mrs @entity18 jokingly compares him to @entity287 in @entity288 and they almost kiss on the roof of the @entity291			0
instead they are interrupted by a phone call from mr @entity77 wishing her happy birthday			0
she is touched when he plays ‘ @entity298 ’ on the saxophone down the line , winning her heart again			0
the pair then go from strength to strength , with mr @entity77 helping mrs @entity18 ’s work by suggesting she subpoena president @entity53 ’s recordings from the @entity305			1
she replies : ‘ i f * * * * * love you			0
i love you and i want to f * * * you ’			0
mrs @entity18 ignores him flirting with a waitress by using his stock line that the watermelons of @entity310 , @entity153 , his home town are the ‘ firmest , juiciest melons ’			0
she looks the other way when a 20 - year - old girl emerges out of his campaign office right in front of her with a smile on her face			2
it is not until 1974 when she is in @entity153 helping mr @entity77 run for the @entity320 against @entity322 incumbent @entity321 that they fall out again because his campaign staff mocked her			0
