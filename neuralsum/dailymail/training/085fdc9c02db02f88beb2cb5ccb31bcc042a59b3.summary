by @entity1 reporter published : 18:57 est , 5 october 2013 updated : 18:59 est , 5 october 2013 former @entity3 presenter @entity2 won an employment tribunal against the @entity5 on the grounds of ageism after she was replaced by a younger host			1
the 56 - year - old has also claimed to be a victim of sexual harassment at the hands of a senior @entity5 executive			1
the @entity5 is long on soul - searching but short on culture change			1
i wish i could say i was surprised to read these shocking accounts of bullying and sexual harassment , but sadly i ’m not			1
more than 930 people gave evidence to the @entity21 inquiry			0
some have now withdrawn it because they have no faith in @entity5 promises that they wo n’t be penalised for speaking out			2
age discrimination : @entity26 at open sessions held for staff to discuss their experiences of harassment and bullying there ’s been silence – no one except union representatives have felt they can speak openly without facing repercussions			1
after the respect at @entity39 was published , one highranking staff member left @entity40 , accepting her career had effectively come to an end because she had voiced her concerns over an issue that subsequently tarnished the @entity5 ’s reputation			2
measures introduced after the @entity21 inquiry were designed to cut the grievance procedure for sexual harassment and bullying complaints from 90 to 30 days			1
but the deliberation time has doubled to 180 days and some serious cases have not been resolved at all			0
staff who were brave in coming forward with their experiences now feel the people who made their lives a misery at work will get off lightly because there is no real will by human resources to get to the truth			0
damning : a @entity5 dossier was compiled by the @entity65 and was one of the pieces of evidence submitted to senior managers at the @entity5 last december i gave evidence to the @entity21 inquiry about a manager who offered me a job , but i then found out he wanted sexual favours in return			1
when i went to see two senior members of staff for advice about bringing a formal complaint , they warned me that the @entity5 would always side with its managers and that if i went ahead it would be unlikely that i would work for the @entity40 again			2
i was a freelancer at the time and could not afford to take the risk			0
the @entity5 is a national treasure			2
in terms of the quality of its news output , it ca n’t be beaten			0
but the viewing public has to know that behind this facade a culture of fear is allowed to thrive			0
this is because executives are a power unto themselves			0
they stick together and guard each other ’s backs .			0
