planning permission was granted , but plans were resubmitted earlier this month			0
@entity112 , managing director of luxury estate agent @entity113 , believes 13 - 14 @entity1 has the potential to be ' one of @entity8 's most outstanding super-prime mansions '			1
she said : ' if refurbished and converted back into a luxury residence it could rival @entity8 's other palatial private residences such as @entity121 or 1 - 3 @entity122			2
' the property directly overlooks @entity3 and it has the benefit of private gardens and terraces			2
' this is prime @entity4 so if the property was refurbished to a high standard it could be worth £ 150 million			2
' this would place it at around £ 5,000 per sq / ft which is a solid price for the area but short of the £ 7,000 + commanded at one @entity3			1
it will also represent a supreme return for its owner , which bought the property and next door in 2010 when property prices were struggling			2

' @entity89 ' is famously associated with the late president @entity9 ( pictured left ) thanks to the skilful media manipulation by @entity0 ( right ) following her husband 's assassination in 1963 ms @entity112 believes the likely buyer will be from the @entity169 with the finished home ideal for royalty			1
she added : ' the potential purchasers ' list for a mansion of this luxury , value and importance is extremely rarefied			0
' the @entity178 , in particular @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 would have the money , and a trophy property like this would interest them			0
' it is possible an oil or gas rich state may also like it for a new embassy or ambassador 's residence but at this price level i think it is more likely to be a billionaire or oil @entity199 buying as a @entity8 home			1
