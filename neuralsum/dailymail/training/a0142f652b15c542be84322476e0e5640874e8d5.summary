with qualification at stake , @entity0 seized the initiative from the first whistle and gained the lead after just seven minutes			2
@entity6 saw his shot saved by @entity5 goalkeeper @entity44 after cutting in from the left - hand side and @entity35 set up @entity8 for the simplest of far post finishes			1
cheered on by a sizeable wednesday afternoon crowd in the @entity82 sunshine , @entity0 continued to surge forward with @entity31 firing over the bar and @entity33 striking the crossbar with a long - range shot			0
@entity0 squandered two or three other presentable openings and paid the price when @entity53 tucked away the rebound after his initial effort had been saved at point - blank range by @entity0 goalkeeper @entity27			0
the @entity92 were n't on level terms for long , however , as @entity6 pounced on a loose ball and sprinted into the box to fire across the keeper and into the far corner			0
@entity44 was helpess to keep that one out but he saved at the feet of both @entity6 and @entity33 before half - time to keep the contest in the balance			0
@entity14 's men have a 100 per cent record in the @entity3 this season @entity5 started the second half brightly and levelled the game at 2 - 2 five minutes after the break			1
@entity52 capitalised on a defensive slip by @entity27 and @entity32 to score			0
@entity0 gradually reasserted their authority and retook the lead when @entity6 tapped home the rebound after @entity28 's effort was blocked by a defender			2
this time there would be no @entity5 fightback and @entity0 made sure of the three points - and their passage to the next round - when @entity9 headed in a @entity119 cross in stoppage time .			2

@entity0 beat @entity5 to reach last 16
@entity6 scored twice , with @entity8 and @entity9 also finding the net at @entity11
the result maintains @entity0 's 100 per cent group stage record
