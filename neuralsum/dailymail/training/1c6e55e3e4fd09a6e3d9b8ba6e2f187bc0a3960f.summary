@entity0 wants to quit @entity1 as soon as january and the @entity2 are ready to do business			1
@entity4 are lining up a bid of around £ 30million for @entity0 , who joined @entity1 from @entity6 last summer for a club record £ 42.5m			1
the @entity8 understands the @entity10 star has grown increasingly unhappy at the @entity11 , not least because he is not being played in his preferred forward floating role by @entity13			1
it might even mean he has played his last game for the @entity2			1
@entity13 does n’t usually like to do business in january but could see the opportunity of offloading @entity0 and bringing in his compatriot @entity26 from @entity6			1
@entity1 may also move for two other @entity10 stars in @entity28 and @entity29			1
@entity31 ’s run - in with the @entity33 tax man could alter the destiny of his club career			1
instead of playing out his days with @entity36 , @entity31 could finally consider a move elsewhere if things get heavy			1
inevitably @entity39 and @entity40 are monitoring the @entity42 's current complicated situation			1
@entity36 's @entity31 ( centre ) challenges for the ball with @entity46 's @entity45 last week @entity48 owners , the @entity47 , could be gearing up for the potential sale of the club within two years for up to $ 3billion			1
sources in @entity52 say there has been wrangling within the family over the future of the club since the death of @entity58 earlier this year			1
i understand that some within the family feel the time to optimise their investment in the club is drawing close			1
@entity66 ( right ) and brother @entity65 during a @entity69 match at @entity70 in 2011 @entity72 businessman @entity71 is the current owner of @entity74 club @entity73 last year the club announced record revenues but the future is not so certain given failure on the pitch last season			1
the huge spend on new players - with more to come - will make a dent in profits over the next year			2
and given the massive loans the @entity47 have out then a predicted rise in @entity88 interest rates could have further impact			1
but who would buy the club at the kind of level the @entity47 want ? i understand one potential buyer could be @entity71			1
@entity72 businessman @entity71 currently owns @entity74 club @entity73			2
but intriguingly @entity71 also has a stake in @entity98 , the @entity99 club backed by ex-united ‘ class of 92 ’ stars @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			2
could it be that @entity71 plans a takeover of @entity48 with the backing of those players ? they could woo back the hearts of those @entity48 fans who despise the @entity47 ownership			1
@entity114 will be hoping for @entity116 backing as they seek to build a new ground			2
non-league @entity114 are @entity120 ’s oldest club and claim to be the second oldest in the world behind @entity122 they have just won their battle to acquire a new site within the borough of @entity127 , close to their original ground , after years of being ' homeless '			1
but they now need planning permission			2
given they intend to build a 3g pitch and offer many other sports facilities - the sort of thing recently championed by @entity116 chairman @entity137 - then the club will seek the help of @entity141 football 's governing body to put pressure on the local council to flag through their progressive plans			1
i am hearing @entity147 is a target for several top clubs in the transfer window but the interest of @entity40 would suit him best			1
@entity17 goalkeeper @entity147 in action during the match against @entity1 at @entity18 @entity155 the @entity116 keep talking up the importance of properly grooming young players through the ranks , especially at @entity160 level			1
@entity163 ’s c team , the national @entity99 side , could have beaten @entity165 this week so it seemed a waste to play under 21 players in a stroll in the park when they could have benefited for a much sharper test against @entity171 on friday night			2
yes , @entity172 sealed a 2 - 1 win over the @entity174 but it could have been more impressive had @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 all played			2
as it is , @entity163 go to @entity171 on tuesday having to defend that slender lead to secure qualification for next summer ’s finals			2
it would certainly have made a statement that playing for the @entity172 is not a ‘ step down ’			2
@entity163 's @entity175 ( right ) holds off the challenge from @entity165 's @entity184 on thursday @entity175 could benefit from being skipper and leader of that side all the way through the finals next summer , when it is hoped the @entity116 have the guts to insist that every player who qualifies is made available by their clubs			2
that way @entity163 would have a serious chance of winning the tournament			0
the senior side can only benefit if a wave of players come through having coped with the pressures of tournament football , albeit at @entity160 level			0
that approach has certainly worked for @entity10			0
four of their @entity210 winning side - @entity204 , @entity28 , @entity26 and @entity0 - were the spine of their 2009 @entity208 winning side which thrashed an understrength @entity163 4 - 0 in the final			1
but , as it is , @entity163 could now fail to even make the finals for the first time in five tournaments			0
it ’s a big game for the @entity215 on tuesday , so why has n’t @entity216 backed up his promises and let @entity218 have the best players available ? after all , an @entity220 should be capable of winning in @entity221			0
@entity10 players celebrate victory over @entity163 in the @entity208 final in june 2009 @entity208 should follow the lead of the @entity226 and make minnows like @entity165 play in a pre-qualifying group			0
what is the point of a supposedly competitive international that everyone knows the result - and pretty much the scoreline - before the start ? i was talking to a @entity238 football reporter and he ca n’t believe countries like @entity165 , the @entity240 , @entity241 and the like play in already bloated groups			0
@entity244 mon : @entity13 says he does n’t regret shoving @entity245 on the touchline			1
that in itself should have prompted @entity116 action			0
last season @entity250 got a stadium ban for a side line set - to			0
why not @entity13 ? tues : in @entity256 ’s new book he argues why @entity257 makes one of his starting xis from the last six decades ahead of @entity260			1
it ’s that sort of strong judgement that would have made @entity256 such a good @entity163 manager			0
wed : @entity264 says @entity101 should be removed as @entity163 coach , allowing him to take his place			0
a bit arrogant from @entity268 , but he does raise the question of why @entity101 is allowed to carry on as a major @entity271 pundit and hold a key role with the @entity163 set up			0
there is a clear conflict of interests			0
@entity101 ( left ) talks with @entity163 manager @entity216 during a training session on tuesday thu : @entity163 beat @entity165 5 - 0 … they would have had bigger problems if @entity280 star @entity279 had come out of retirement at @entity282			0
fri : @entity172 do well to overcome @entity171 but ca n’t help feeling @entity216 has let @entity218 down by not letting him have the best players to secure qualification for the finals			0
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * @entity286 @entity287 failed to fill his boots in the 5 - 0 sleepwalk over @entity165 but his goal from a penalty edges him close to overtaking sir @entity293 ’s @entity163 record of 49 international goals			0
he should move even closer in @entity221			0
as it stands , only @entity295 ( 44 ) , @entity296 ( 48 ) and @entity297 stand ahead of @entity287			0
without taking anything away from @entity287 , there are more cheap international goals about than there were in @entity296 ’s day let alone in the @entity295 and @entity293 era			0
that said , for some of his faults @entity287 is the only current @entity163 player who would have got close to making @entity163 ’s @entity309 - winning side , or indeed the @entity311 team which reached the semi-finals and with a bit more luck could have won it			2
@entity163 captain @entity287 scores from the penalty spot against @entity165 on thursday given that @entity216 has made him @entity163 captain there seems little doubt @entity287 will surpass @entity321 ’s record perhaps by the end of this season			0
no doubt sir @entity293 will salute @entity287 but anybody who thinks the record books and statistics tell the whole story are misguided			0
indeed , while sir @entity330 eventually took the goalscoring plaudits with his unique hat - trick in the 1966 final after he took the place of @entity295 - the best ever instinctive @entity141 striker - and @entity336 was the inspiration of the team , in many ways it was @entity293 who was the talisman			0
sir @entity293 ( left ) scores for @entity163 against @entity343 in an international at @entity282 in 1965 certainly , @entity293 was the @entity163 player who football fans around the world viewed with most awe			0
he scored two routine but crucial goals when @entity163 overcame @entity349 in the semi-finals - @entity287 has only managed one @entity210 goal in three tournaments - but the strike that summed @entity297 up best was his spectacular effort in the group stage win over @entity355 .			0

@entity0 has grown increasingly unhappy at @entity1 and wants to leave
@entity4 are lining up a bid of around £ 30million for the @entity359
@entity2 boss @entity13 could bring in @entity6 's @entity26
@entity39 and @entity40 are monitoring @entity31 's current situation
the @entity47 could be gearing up for the sale of @entity48 within two years
@entity367 owner @entity366 would want £ 300m for the sale of the club
