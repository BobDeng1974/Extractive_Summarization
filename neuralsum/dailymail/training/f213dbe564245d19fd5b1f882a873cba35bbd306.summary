@entity0 accuses @entity1 of having a bullying culture and tries to portray himself as a victim in his autobiography that will become public on monday			1
@entity0 , shown the door by @entity1 when they finally had enough of his maverick ways after their humiliation in @entity9 , reserves his most stinging criticism for @entity12 and @entity11 in an extraordinary attack on @entity1			1
the first glimpse of what looks likely to be a rant against those who lost patience with him came in an interview with the @entity21			2
@entity0 's autobiography is published on monday and @entity23 cricket has eagerly awaited its release @entity0 discusses alleged ' bullying nature ' of the @entity1 team and @entity11 ( right ) as ' ruling by fear ' it has long been known that @entity0 would aim his guns on prior , a selfless team man who tried to broker a peace deal after @entity0 had sent derogatory texts about @entity35 to @entity37 opponents but who now finds himself accused of leading a concerted regime of bullying within the team			1
hugely disturbing , ’ says @entity0 in the telegraph of what he says was the culture within the @entity1 team when they rose to become the best in the world			1
‘ i brought it up on numerous occasions			0
i told @entity35 about it			0
i told @entity49 about it			1
it was a huge thing			0
‘ i could give you telephone numbers of international players around the world			0
you ring them and ask how the @entity1 team have conducted themselves over the last three or four years			1
people would say to me , “ i ca n’t believe you could play with these guys ? ” @entity0 has taken aim at former coach flower ahead of his new autobiography which is released on monday @entity12 ‘ he ’s a bad influence , a negative influence , he picks on players ’ @entity11 ‘ he did n’t like one of his soldiers to hammer him			1
he wanted me to fear him ’ the @entity67 ‘ i regret being involved in conversations like that … i went to his house to apologise ’ ‘ the bowlers were given so much power			1
they were doing really well but these guys ran the dressing room			1
the thing that horrified me most was when @entity35 and @entity11 said before the one - day internationals in @entity78 , “ guys , we ’ve got to stop this			1
it ’s not right for the team			0
people have come to us who are intimidated to field the ball			0
” ‘ and the bowlers had the audacity to stand there and say , “ no , if they * * * * up we deserve an apology ”			2
it ’s the most angry i ’ve ever got in the dressing room			1
i thought , “ i reckon i could hit these guys			0
” @entity0 stops short of hammering @entity49 , whom he calls ‘ good at heart			1
’ but he can not resist attacking prior			0
‘ @entity49 is n’t the greatest speaker but his sidekick @entity12 could talk the hind legs off a donkey			1
so @entity49 wanted prior close to him			2
he wanted his vice-captain to do all his talking for him			0
so when i went after prior i said he should n’t be in the team , he ’s a bad influence , a negative influence , he picks on players			2
’ as expected , @entity0 attacks flower even though @entity1 ’s most successful coach was the man who gave him one last chance after he betrayed @entity35			1
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity12 ( right ) during better times in 2010 after @entity1 took on @entity9 in @entity104 @entity0 ( right ) : ' it 's only prior ( left ) that i 'd seriously have real issues with , because of how he was portrayed ' ‘ i ’ve been one of the only ones who constantly through his reign as coach did not say “ how high ” when he said “ jump ”			1
he built a regime , he did n’t build a team			0
' i told him on numerous occasions , “ you ’re playing by fear here , you want players to be scared of you			2
and @entity11 , i ’m not scared of you ”			2
' he had it in for me since i tried to get rid of him as second in command			0
@entity11 did n’t like one of his soldiers to hammer him			2
he wanted me to fear him			0
i ’ll never fear you buddy			0
’ there is one shock admission of regret over sending the messages about @entity35 but he claims it was because he was ‘ broken ’ by a parody @entity132 account mocking him			0
he says his mistake was not disagreeing with the @entity37 calling @entity35 a ‘ doos ’ , which , loosely translated , is the word @entity35 called @entity0 when he was commenting for @entity136 this summer and thought he was off - air			2
former coach @entity11 and @entity0 had their disagreements and the latter has revealed more on the matter @entity0 ( right ) claims he was ignored after trying to alert flower to the anxiety condition of @entity143 ‘ a doos is just an idiot and i regret being involved in conversations like that , ’ @entity0 tells the @entity21			1
‘ but mentally i was totally broken			0
i was crying in a room with @entity11 during that @entity149 ( against @entity150 at @entity151 ) saying , “ how the hell has it come to this ? ” ‘ why ? because i was told by a senior player that the @entity132 account was being run from inside the dressing room			1
i was completely broken , absolutely finished , mentally shot			0
yes of course i regret getting @entity158 involved and i went to his house to apologise			0
i apologised to his wife , too			0
’ extraordinarily , @entity0 claims he still wants to play for @entity1 even though he made no attempt to play any first - class cricket for @entity163 last summer and did not reach 60 in any @entity165 innings in three competitions all year			1
‘ i know my issues are not just with the captain but with the board , ’ he said			0
‘ if that changes — and i believe it could in the next few months — then i really believe i could play for @entity1 again			1
‘ the reason is that i honestly , 100 per cent believe i could i can help the youngsters and i believe i can help @entity174 get better			0
i said to @entity11 in that @entity176 series , please , whenever you speak to @entity174 , if he needs my help i ’ll help him			2
i ’m incredibly passionate about @entity23 cricket			0
i always want @entity1 to win			2
’ @entity0 has a funny way of showing it , that ’s for sure			2
