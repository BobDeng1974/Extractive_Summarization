an @entity1 zoo where tourists pose for photos inside lion cages could be shut down amid claims the animals appear drugged			1
visitors to @entity8 in @entity9 boasted of having an up - and - close experience for just £ 25 - but outraged animal activists handed their social media photos to the government			1
now widespread reports suggest the zoo could be sanctioned or even shut down because the @entity1 capital 's laws prevent direct contact between people and wild animals			1
he said the contact was against @entity41 of a provincial law which bans ' direct animal contact with the public ' in parks and estates where animals are exhibited			1
his officials were sent social media photos by animal rights activists so sent inspectors - who were able to join the queues of dozens of tourists waiting to touch the animals			2
mr @entity37 added that he had asked for the ' maximum penalty ' which could mean ' economic sanctions or closure '			0
the zoo has around 400 animals and is said to offer a ' unique interacting experience ' in which visitors can pet , stroke , cuddle and even sit on lions , tigers and brown bears			1
it insists the animals are raised with domestic animals such as dogs and a keeper is always on hand in case anything goes wrong			2
memento : one photo posted on social media shows a tourist pretending to attack the vacant - looking lion one reviewer from @entity79 wrote : ' to have been able to pet a white tiger was a dream come true for me ' it adds that the animals are fed prior to interacting with visitors ' so they wo n't feel hungry when a human is inside their cage '			2
zoo spokesman @entity88 said : ' the animals are no more dangerous than domestic dogs because we have taught them the boundaries			2
' we are the only zoo in the world that practices special training in gentleness techniques			1
' but animal rights groups and some tourists rubbished the claims , including on the travel review site @entity101			1
one anonymous reviewer wrote : ' there was one lion unconscious lion passed out on a picnic table			0
when someone arrived for a photo , water was thrown on the clearly drugged lion 's face and meat was dangled in front of it			2
' another wrote : ' since i got there and saw the poor animals , i realised something was happening in there			0
it seems like these animals are drugged or sedated ... it 's just a matter of time until someone gets hurt , and who will be the one to blame ? ' hug : a @entity128 group by activists calling for the zoo to be shut down has more than 6,000 members another , from @entity133 , wrote : ' it was an amazing experience that i went into a bit naive			1
the animals are clearly drugged , especially the lions			1
' however , they are taken care of and it was still terrifying to get to get in the cages with them to pet or feed them			0
you should just know what you are getting into			0
' i definitely would have thought twice about going if i had realised the animals were going to be doped up			0
' and a @entity9 native wrote : ' this zoo is inhumane and made my stomach turn the entire time i was there			1
yes , you can get close enough to pet a tiger or ride a lion but the animals are obviously sedated and if you have ever seen these beautiful creatures in the wild it is obvious			0
' a @entity128 group called ' @entity158 ' now has more than 6,000 members			0
its founders wrote : ' we are against animal mistreatment and consider @entity163 to be one of the worst zoos in @entity1			1
' many of the animals are sedated for the selfish enjoyment of people without conscience			2
close @entity163 ! ' controversy : not everyone hated the zoo - and the vast majority of reviews on @entity101 were positive another visitor to the zoo boasted that a full experience cost only £ 25 including tips to staff inside the cage yet not everyone is against the zoo			1
one visitor who reviewed on @entity101 said she was thrilled that the whole experience only cost £ 25 including tips			2
and of the 1,800 @entity186 reviewers , only 130 said it was ' poor ' or ' terrible ' , with more than half ( 960 ) saying their experience was ' excellent '			0
one reviewer from @entity79 wrote : ' to have been able to pet a white tiger was a dream come true for me			0
i 've loved them since i saw the tiger on the cover of my science book in high school			0
that experience definitely made up for the negative things we encountered at that zoo			0
' another from @entity203 added : ' i would say it 's not likely the animals are being sedated , but rather that they 're well - fed and raised with dogs			0

@entity163 says lions have ' special training in gentleness techniques '
but @entity101 critics *complained* animals appeared ' clearly drugged '
now *regional* government of @entity9 appears to be cracking down
*minister* said law prevents direct contact between animals and people
