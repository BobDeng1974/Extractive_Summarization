think how much easier life would be if , in a crowded and noisy bar , you could tune in to what your friend is saying on the other side of a room and block out all other conversations			2
this is what one designer is suggesting might be possible in just a year or two – and it could come in especially handy for spies operating in crowded public places			0
@entity14 of @entity15 , @entity16 , thinks we will one day be able to wear devices that give us ‘ superpowers ’ such as ultra-directional hearing , incredible motor skills and anonymity when we want it			0
@entity24 looks like a futuristic hearing aid			1
it is currently just a concept , but its creator thinks it could allow users to hone in on specific noises and conversations in busy spaces , by simply pointing at the person you would like to listen to - and he thinks this could happen in just a couple of years he came up with a concept called @entity40 , which looks like a futuristic hearing aid			1
‘ @entity24 would allow you to hear life as you intend it , though selective hearing , sound filtering , voice modification and more , ’ @entity44 , operations manager at the firm told @entity46			1
the design for the device takes inspiration from noise cancelling headphones , which block out background sounds			1
but unlike the headphones , @entity24 could amplify wanted sounds too , such as a conversation , @entity55 reported			1
if the concept becomes a reality , the gadget would be able to track movement to zone in on a particular person			2
the ultimate goal is for a wearer to point or nod in the direction of a person they would like to hone in on and amplify their what they are saying			0
the conceptual device ( pictured ) is designed to be the size of an ear bud and could contain an array of microphones for sound isolation			1
it would also incorporate a camera for object recognition and gesture control			0
its creator thinks the device could one day replace smartphones and people would ear it constantly the @entity40 is currently just a concept but its inventors think it could become a reality in just two years			1
the gadget is designed to fit inside the ear and hook round over the tragus , curling behind the ear			0
it is intended to give people selective hearing so they can zone in on an interesting conversation in a noisy room , while cancelling out background noise so they can hear it clearly			1
it would do this by using an array of built - in microphones as well as a camera to track movement			1
@entity24 's creators think it could replace the smartphone and that people would wear it constantly			2
future iterations of the design could also allow people to translate other languages in real - time			1
‘ utilising an advanced microphone array and motion sensing camera , @entity40 allows you to point at a sound target in order to isolate and adjust the volume of everything else around you , ’ mr @entity112 explained			0
‘ the device is as small as a @entity123 earbud , and contains an array of microphones for sound isolation			2
it also provides object recognition and gesture control			0
' using a built - in camera , @entity24 can take pictures , provide object recognition of things you look at and watch your hands for gestures which it interprets as commands			1
’ mr @entity14 believes such a device could replace smartphones and people would wear it all the time			1
it would contain all their contacts , could connect to a phone and allow a new hi - tech type of teleconferencing			0
‘ if this is the next - gen @entity148 , the idea of spatially placing people could be phenomenal , ’ he said			0
mr @entity112 added : ‘ we expect that in the near future , many social media apps will break free from smartphones , and become their own form of wearables			0
‘ more than just umbrellas that tell you when rain is coming , these are the apps that reach deep into our digital lifestyles – and when they develop physical manifestations as wearables , their reach will extend into the real world and more deeply into your real life			0
he claims : ‘ @entity24 could completely redefine the human - aural experience			0
‘ with @entity24 , you control what you hear ; you can drown out the drone of your parents ’ lecturing , translate a @entity176 speaker as he ’s talking to you , zero in on your friend at a loud party , or mute the loud talker seated nearby in a restaurant			2
’ ‘ you ’ll even have a recorded and transcribed history of everything you hear			0
’ he thinks this futuristic vision could become a reality in ‘ a year or two ’			2
@entity24 could make it easier to eaves drop on conversations in public places , like a bar , and would be very useful for spies			0
its inventors think it could replace smartphones and one day include a feature to translate a foreign language in real - time			1

@entity24 - a conceptual device - looks like a futuristic hearing aid
it could let wearers hear a specific conversation in a noisy room
gadget would *silence* background sounds to gain selective hearing
creator of the concept said it would include an array of microphones and a camera to read gestures , and could become a reality in a year or two
he thinks the device could replace smartphones and be worn constantly
future iterations of the design could also translate foreign languages
