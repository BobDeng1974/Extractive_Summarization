if right - wingers catch the wave of an election blowout on tuesday , four @entity1 candidates could tilt the scales of diversity in their favor – including one openly gay man whose campaign has been forced to deny that he has exposed himself to staffers and masturbated in public places			1
two @entity1 aim to join @entity13 sen. @entity12 as the only blacks from their party in @entity16			1
@entity17 , a @entity19 - @entity18 former mayor of @entity20 , @entity21 , failed in her first attempt to win a congressional seat in 2012 , losing to a @entity25 incumbent by just 768 votes out of more than 245 cast			1
this time she 's fighting to win an open seat , and polls are tilted in her favor			2
in @entity33 , former @entity32 undercover operative @entity31 is in a pitched battle against first - term democrat @entity35 in an expansive majority - @entity37 district that winds 830 miles from @entity39 to @entity40			1
the last black @entity18 house @entity1 was retired @entity42 lt. col. @entity41 , who won in the 2010 tea party landslide but was defeated two years later			1
@entity45 's @entity46 ? : @entity1 @entity1 candidate @entity47 is struggling in a toss - up race because of allegations that he exposed his genitals to staffers and was caught masturbating in his office and in a public restroom @entity54 , @entity21 style : front - runner @entity17 aims to bring diversity to the @entity1 @entity1 history : @entity57 ( left ) was a civil rights activist and the first @entity58 to serve in the @entity59 , in 1870			1
clergyman @entity60 ( right ) was the first black @entity58 to be elected to the @entity61 @entity25 have long - enjoyed the perception among african - americans that they should be the default recipient of blacks ' votes – largely , conservatives say , because the @entity68 programs inaugurated by @entity25 president @entity69 , and enlarged under @entity70 and @entity71 , benefit blacks through a massive government welfare system			1
but while today 's black civil rights leaders cite a history of racism and discrimination as the primary reason to elect @entity25 , they tend to downplay the fact that the original black civil rights icon , president @entity83 , was a @entity1			1
most of the @entity86 's historically loathsome 20th century segregationists were @entity25			0
two openly gay @entity1 could also join their states ' congressional delegation in @entity89 @entity90 in @entity91 lost his 2012 race against longtime incumbent @entity94 @entity93			1
this time , however , @entity95 was upset in the primary by a little - known @entity98 veteran , @entity97			2
the lack of an incumbent could tip the scales in @entity90 's favor			0
he 's a former minority leader in the @entity104 who also lost a 2010 bid for lieutenant governor			0
three time zones away in @entity108 , @entity109 , openly gay @entity47 is challenging one - term incumbent @entity110 in a race that every major polling organization rates as a toss - up			1
but @entity47 would likely be leading if it were n't for a trio of sexual - misconduct accusations that are giving some voters second thoughts			2
his campaign has issued firm denials to all of them			2
election day : @entity18 are voting in every state on tuesday , with implications that will shape the last two years of the @entity71 presidency and public policy that could stretch decades into the future out : @entity1 candidate for @entity16 @entity90 hopes to up the @entity1 's diversity quotient , but @entity25 homosexuals would still outnumber @entity1 in @entity16 @entity131 : @entity132			1
@entity134 ( left0 was the first openly gay member of @entity16 , and @entity136 weathered snarks and cruel jokes until 2013 as a congressman from the same state – but was once embroiled in a rent - boy scandal involving his housemate 's ' side business ' @entity31 , a @entity33 @entity1 @entity1 candidate , is trying to beat a @entity37 in a majority - @entity37 district on oct. 10 @entity145 broke a story about a former campaign staffer who said he caught @entity47 masturbating in his office in april			1
' i came over to his office , door was open			0
and he was masturbating , ' @entity154 's former policy director @entity153 said			0
' i saw his hand , his penis in his hand , and he had a smile on his face			0
and as soon as i came over he was looking at me			0
' two days ago a second campaign worker made a similar allegation in an interview with @entity163			2
' i was at the urinal , and ( @entity47 ) came from the stall that was closest to the urinal and was kind of just standing there hovering , ' former regional political director @entity167 claimed			0
' i turned around and realized that it was @entity47			0
he had his pants up , but his fly was undone , and he had his hand over , not over , grasping his genitals			0
' a former @entity174 colleague has told @entity145 that he witnessed @entity47 masturbating in the city hall bathroom on two occasions			0
it 's unclear whether the @entity180 revelations will be enough to doom @entity47			0
a @entity182 aide told @entity183 on background that ' we hope voters are smart enough to see that this is a mean - spirited effort by disgruntled former employees			0
if anyone made these accusations about a @entity94 , they would be pilloried as homophobic and prejudiced			2

@entity17 , a conservative @entity193 , tries a second time in a tight @entity21 @entity18 @entity1 race
@entity31 , a former undercover @entity32 agent , is in a tight race with a one - term @entity33 @entity94
two openly gay @entity199 are running for @entity16 in @entity91 and @entity109
one has been *dogged* by allegations that he exposed himself and masturbated in front of aides – charges that his campaign denies
there are seven openly gay members of @entity16 – all democrats
