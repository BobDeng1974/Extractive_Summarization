a couple have been left fuming after spending £ 200,000 on a brand new home - only to find their cars wo n't fit into the garage			1
@entity5 , 37 , was stunned to discover the garage at the detached three - bedroom property in @entity8 , @entity9 , was too narrow to accommodate her @entity10			1
her partner @entity11 , 33 , managed to squeeze his @entity12 all the way in , but was left stuck in his car because there was n't enough space to open his door			0
' abysmal ' : @entity5 and her partner @entity11 ( seen left with son @entity18 ) , were stunned to discover the garage at their brand new £ 200,000 home is too small for their car to fit inside ( right ) tight squeeze : ms @entity5 claims the garage is not fit for purpose , and said it effectively knocks £ 8,000 off the value of the family 's newly built home in @entity8 the couple , who have a two - year - old son , @entity18 , only discovered the problem when they cleared out belongings they had been storing in the garage since moving into their new £ 209,950 home in march			1
when they complained to developer @entity43 , they were told they should have measured the garage before buying their new house , said ms @entity5			1
the furious health and safety manager has been told that the bungle could knock up to £ 8,000 off the value of their home			1
she said : ' it 's not fit for purpose			1
the garage does n't do what a garage should do			2
i 'm absolutely fuming about it			0
' she explained : ' we did n't realise for a few months because the garage was stored with our belongings that we had n't sorted after the move			2
i tried to get my car in recently but the wing mirrors make it too wide			0
' it 's a company car so i did n't want to scratch it , so @entity11 tried to get his car in			0
' he could get it inside , but he could n't open the doors			0
so unless you have a sunroof it does n't look like there 's any way you can get a car into the garage and step out of it			2
' furious : ms @entity5 , 37 , said the garage - which measures 2m and 44cm from wall to wall - is too small to fit an average - sized family car no room : the couple , who have a two - year - old son , spent £ 209,950 on the detached family home in @entity8 ms @entity5 said the neighbours she has spoken to had n't realised the problem , because none of them had been using their garages to store their cars			1
she explained that the specification for the house in @entity8 , @entity9 , gave dimensions for all rooms in the house - except the garage			1
she said : ' i 've asked a number of estate agents about the problem , and at least two have told me that i ca n't advertise my house as having a garage if i know it does n't function as a garage			2
' they said they add 8,000 pounds on to the value of a house if it has a garage - so we 've lost that off the 209,950 pounds we paid for the house			1
' a house is meant to be an investment - and this one feels like a poor investment			0
' i wrote to the chief operating officer of @entity43 but he replied saying he had referred the matter to the technical director in the regional team			0
' poor investment ' : ms @entity5 said the garage houses a tumble dryer and lawnmower instead of the family car ' and that technical director suggested that i should have measured the garage before we put down a deposit			1
' when you buy a three - bedroom detached family home with a garage you expect the garage to be big enough to get a car into			1
' ms @entity5 has since got out her measuring tape and researched the size of popular family cars on the internet			1
she found that the garage door width of 2m 3cm was too small for eight of the 14 cars she compared			2
' @entity43 deemed the size to be appropriate but it 's clearly not , ' she said			0
including wing mirror width the cars that would n't fit included some of the most popular models , from a @entity155 to a @entity156			2
the garage is big enough to accommodate the @entity12 , the @entity158 , the @entity159 , the @entity160 , the @entity161 and the @entity162			2
but while the cars would go in , the 2m 44cm wall - to - wall width means none would have sufficient space to open the driver door			0
for now the ' garage ' is used to store a dryer , two filing cabinets , a lawnmower and a strimmer			2
the mother - of - one said : ' because the garage is built into the house we realise that they ca n't just knock it down and start again			1
' we asked @entity43 if they would plaster the third wall - two are already done - and put some lino on the floor , so we could use it as a storage room with at least more insulation than it has now to keep out the damp , but they refused			0
' the couple 's drive only has room for one car so they 've asked for it to be widened to fit two cars , but they have heard nothing back since			1
' we 're not asking for anything drastic			0
it 's not like we 're asking them to knock down the house and start again , ' ms @entity5 said			1
@entity198 , managing director at @entity43 , said : ' as one of the @entity202 's leading housebuilders it can only be a matter of deep regret to us if any customer is dissatisfied with their new home			0
' the garage in question is comparable with new build properties across the @entity202			0
we continue to work with @entity209 and mr @entity11 to try and resolve the situation			0
' a spokesperson for @entity43 added : ' the dimensions of each garage are governed by both the size of the house and the relevant planning regulations and are clearly laid out in the marketing brochure			0
we deeply regret that @entity209 and mr @entity11 are unhappy with the size of their garage			0
