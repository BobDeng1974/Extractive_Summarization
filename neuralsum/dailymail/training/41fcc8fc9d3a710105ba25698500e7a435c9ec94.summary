by @entity0 a six - month - old @entity2 baby born with a major heart defect has been denied life saving surgery at a @entity7 hospital , and now her mother wants to know why			1
@entity9 is facing an uphill battle in the fight to keep her daughter , @entity12 alive after she was prevented from having the life - saving operation at @entity7 's @entity14 because of a severe change in her condition back in february			1
her daughter was initially scheduled to be flown to @entity7 three months ago , but was prevented from traveling because she suffered a ' tet spell ' which is brought about by a dramatic drop in the amount of oxygen in the blood			1
denied proper care : @entity9 said her daughter was prevented from having heart surgery at @entity25 due to an improper duty of care in @entity2 now her mother has squared the blame on @entity30 clinicians for failing to provide a proper duty of care , which lead to her daughter ' going blue in the face			1
' she wants to know the exact circumstances which lead her to have the ' tet spell ' , and has demanded an inquiry be undertaken at @entity37 to investigate exactly why she was moved from the @entity37 children 's ward to the intensive care unit			1
she claims she was n't told about her daughter 's change in condition straight away , and the fact she had been relocated to the @entity44 while waiting for her daughter to arrive in @entity7			2
@entity12 suffered a severe ' tet spell ' and was moved into @entity44 without her mother having any knowledge of her condition she told the @entity49 news : ' i do n’t believe she was being watched and we want an internal investigation into the circumstances			1
' ' i have always been able to control her tet spells very quickly			0
i want to know if my baby was being monitored properly while i was away from her that led her to have an episode so severe that it has now destroyed her last chance at life			0
' but in an email statement , seen by the @entity49 news , the director of medical services at @entity37 dr @entity62 said : “ we can confirm that the patient ( @entity12 ) is being treated appropriately under the care of local senior specialists in conjunction with interstate specialists			2
” ms @entity62 also told @entity70 : " this is a sad and complex case and our thoughts are with the parents and family			0
there have been multiple independent interstate clinical opinions received , regarding the safety of performing cardiac surgery for the patient			0
” it has been a tiring an emotional three months for mrs @entity12 who has been spending 24 - hours - a - day by her daughter 's hospital cot			2
not only does she have her daughter 's illness to contend with , but she is also a mother to seven other children two of which are under the age of seven			0
in what looked like a positive sign of hope for the family , doctors from @entity91 's @entity90 had come forward with an offer to perform the surgery just three weeks ago , but that has since lapsed because of a high chance it could leave the six - month - old with brain damage			0
mrs @entity12 said she has been left to feel like her daughter 's life is worthless , and still does n't know if her daughter will be given the life - saving surgery she needs			1
' ( we are ) being made to feel that more or less she does not have the right to live			0
' ' she is in dire and desperate need of the surgery and if she does n't we know she will die , ' she said			2
the family is now appealing for an independent pediatric specialist to examine @entity12 following the family 's allegations surrounding her treatment .			0
