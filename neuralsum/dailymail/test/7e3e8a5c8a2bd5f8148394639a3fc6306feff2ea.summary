from there , fans will head toward @entity62 , a former @entity64 fort that is celebrated for its @entity66 architecture			0
from @entity67 to @entity68 , these are the various filming locations that are just as beautiful in real life as on screen the seven - night @entity2 tour kicks off in @entity46 , @entity19 ( pictured ) with who days of sightseeing before heading further south from there , the tour heads to the @entity38 capital , @entity36 , including a stop at the world 's largest gothic cathedral the former @entity64 fort of @entity62 is the next stop , where the palace , celebrated for its @entity66 architecture , is one of the oldest in service the @entity62 , a @entity59 , also provides the setting for the @entity87 of @entity88 in the series the upper levels of the @entity62 are still used by the @entity19 royal family as their official @entity36 residence , making it the oldest palace still in service			1
registered by @entity58 as a @entity59 in 1987 , the @entity62 's stunning courtyards and lavish gardens also offer the perfect setting for the @entity87 of @entity88 , a retreat for the @entity100			0
here , prince @entity101 , portrayed by actor @entity102 , will meet with @entity103 , played by actor @entity104 , in order to try to save the land and his people			0
it 's not the first time that the @entity62 has been used as a filming location			2
it was also the set for the court of the @entity113 in 2005 's @entity114 and was also used while filming @entity115 in 1962			2
from @entity36 , @entity2 enthusiasts will head to the town of @entity118 , specifically to take in the city 's impressive bullring although the @entity1 series filmed all around @entity118 , it 's the bullring that is of particular interest , as it will appear as @entity125 's pit @entity118 and @entity126 , @entity19 a day trip to @entity118 is also on the docket , specifically to take in the city 's impressive bullring , which will appear as @entity125 's pit in the upcoming season			1
on the sixth day , guests will travel to nearby @entity126 to experience the rolling hills and timeless buildings , and , of course , an authentic flamenco show			0
it is here that fans will find one of the finest examples of moorish architecture in @entity142 , the remains of the @entity145 palace , with its stunning arabesques , high ceilings and tiled walls			2
while crews reportedly visited the stunning @entity145 while scouting locations , fans will have to tune in to see whether or not it makes an appearance			0
the @entity155 region of @entity13 is recognisable as the @entity157 area in the hit show @entity2 for the icy scenes , programme makers favoured the @entity162 volcano in the @entity155 region of @entity13 @entity13 throughout the series , @entity13 has represented the northern-most tip of @entity23 , with show runners preferring the real - life landscape to scenes created through computer generated green screens			1
in fact , the crew liked the country 's majestic vistas so much that they returned to the areas of @entity176 and @entity177 in summer 2014 to film again			0
while the icy crater of the @entity162 volcano has made several appearances , fans will also likely recognise @entity176 from @entity182 's storyline and as the setting for the battle of the hound and @entity186			0
the @entity187 and the @entity189 tower stands proudly in @entity190 , @entity16 in @entity2 the castle towers are transformed into @entity192 , where the head of @entity194 rules over his people the breathtaking beech tree lined road is known as the @entity199 to locals near @entity201 in @entity202 , @entity16 @entity16 although the bulk of the show 's filming in @entity16 takes place in a studio in @entity209 , there are several noteworthy off - site filming locations that offer the @entity16 economy a much - appreciated tourism boost thanks to hardcore fans			1
among them , the @entity187 and the @entity217 , both of which stand proudly in @entity190			0
the @entity219 was the principle filming location for the pilot and season one , standing in for @entity192 's courtyard			2
however , to fans of @entity2 , the beautiful pathway will be more recognisable as the @entity226 and the @entity199 of @entity227 the @entity228 , where the character @entity229 comes from , are actually based on @entity231 in @entity16 here , fans welcomed the @entity233 to rule over their people			1
also noteworthy is the @entity231 in @entity235 , which fans will recognise from @entity229 's homecoming , and the beech tree lined road known as the @entity199 , in nearby @entity201			0
though the tranquil pathway is beloved by locals , it 's probably best recognised as the @entity226 and the @entity199 of @entity227 in the series			0
the sun sets on the beautiful town of @entity246 , in @entity68 , which @entity2 fans may recognise as @entity248 the fortified city of @entity250 provided the setting for the fictional city of @entity253 , which featured in the show 's third season clearly , the ancient city 's red citadel and the nearby @entity258 impressed the @entity2 producers @entity68 for the third series , film crews headed to @entity68 to film sequences in the fictional cities of @entity253 and @entity248			1
two locations were used in the @entity266 country , @entity246 and @entity250 , both of which are @entity59			0
@entity250 , a fortified mud - brick fortress city , is better known by @entity2 fans as @entity271 , while the stunning walled town of @entity246 transformed into @entity248 , which played a vital role in the series three finale episode			1
it 's hard to look at the coastal city of @entity278 , @entity12 and not see the backdrop of @entity113 's @entity280 the @entity281 and fortification is a @entity59 on the @entity283 in @entity278 @entity278 , @entity12 it 's hard to look at @entity12 's stunning @entity285 and not see @entity286			2
the site of endless drama , incestuous affairs , a shocking beheading and the @entity291 , this tourist - loved town along the @entity293 was not actually the first choice for the pivotal backdrop			0
in the first series , the historic city of @entity297 , @entity67 , was used as the filming location , before switching to @entity12 at the start of series two , a move which allowed creators to film near the sea			2
when the show runners switched to filming in @entity12 at the start of series two , they were able to film near the @entity293 the @entity281 is possibly most recognised as the @entity308 from the series two finale episode the @entity281 , part of the @entity312 , also played a pivotal role in the series two finale			2
also the highest point of the city , the @entity281 is notable for being the spot where @entity319 walked around and around before entering the @entity308			0
and the @entity59 is now just one of several stops on the newly - created themed walking tours that have popped up around the city to cater to globe - trotting @entity2 fans			1
the natural limestone arch of the @entity326 , in @entity327 , @entity67 , was used during filming in the show 's first series the stunning natural wonder is perhaps best recognised as the backdrop for the @entity332 and @entity334 wedding in series one @entity67 and finally , no @entity2 themed trip around the world would be complete without a visit to this @entity340 archipelago			1
comprised of just three inhabited islands - @entity67 , @entity327 and @entity342 - the historical republic is home to an impressive nine @entity59			0
among them , the historic stone city of @entity297 , which provided the backdrop for @entity286 during much of the pilot and series one episodes			0
during the first season , the city of @entity297 , @entity67 , was the location of @entity286 ( pictured : the historical city gate monument ) unfortunately , @entity67 officials were said to have complained that protected habitats were being damaged during filming , in particular on the island of @entity327 , meaning that from series two onwards , these exterior scenes were shot in @entity12			1
home to the @entity326 , @entity67 's smaller sister island of @entity327 , is a breathtaking sight , recognised by @entity2 fans as where @entity319 wed @entity334			1
island officials took issue with the crew over potential damage inflicted on the natural wonder and thus , producers were forced to change filming locations at the start of series three			1
the fifth series of @entity2 debuts in the @entity376 on april 12 and in the @entity377 and @entity378 on april 13 .			2

@entity1 's hit series , @entity2 , set to return with its fifth season , which was filmed all over @entity142
