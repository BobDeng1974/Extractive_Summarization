by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 had been asked to organise a tennis tournament			1
it was on a pre-season tour of @entity6 , and the then captain of @entity8 , someone who fancied himself a bit with a racket , was happy to oblige			1
only by the time @entity8 ’s manager @entity13 returned from a game of golf for what he hoped would be the latter stages of the competition , war had broken out among his players , with a raging @entity21 at the centre of the argument			1
‘ it was all kicking off , ’ remembers @entity13 , whose @entity8 side were preparing for a season in @entity26 back in 1983			1
he was doing it deliberately to wind up @entity35 but @entity35 could n’t see the funny side			1
' he was like @entity38			1
but then he ’s someone who wants to win that much , at whatever he ’s doing			2
i see it as a quality but he can be a bit of a b * * * * * d as well sometimes			1
’ @entity13 is telling this story over a coffee in @entity47 , near @entity48			1
he ’s 76 now , and retains a soft @entity50 accent despite living in @entity29 for the past 53 years			1
he arrived here after serious injury denied him the chance to build a first - class career with @entity54			2
he played senior first - team football in @entity29 instead before moving into coaching			1
but the man who became known as ‘ @entity58 ’ remains a respected figure			2
not least for discovering a teenage @entity60 and mentoring him at @entity61			2
laying down the law : @entity21 gives instructions to @entity64 and ( right ) @entity65 shows strain his eye for a player and the success he enjoyed as a manager is why @entity13 is worth listening to when it comes to the new boss of @entity73 and a man about to embark on a @entity76 adventure with @entity29 , who play @entity33 in @entity78 on friday			1
‘ i first met @entity35 at @entity8 , ’ says @entity13			1
‘ he was there already ; the captain when i arrived			2
he was n’t the quickest but he could see the situations			2
‘ i ’d heard stories about how he used to go into the manager ’s office as captain and talk about the team			2
when i took over he phoned me to say he wanted to talk about the team			2
i told him i was n’t interested in his opinion ; that i needed to form my own view of the players			2
and i took the captaincy off him			2
‘ i do n’t think he liked me because of that			2
even though i made him captain again in my third season , because by then we had a good team and he was playing well			1
’ great @entity98 : @entity13 coached @entity21 at @entity8 in the 1980s they had some good players			1
@entity101 , @entity21 ’s assistant with @entity29 in @entity102 this summer , was one			1
born into a staunchly @entity105 family on august 8 , 1951 , @entity2 was the youngest of nine children			2
the family lived in the middle - class @entity109 district of @entity48 , at @entity111 , a street divided by a canal with large areas of grass perfect for organising football matches			2
as @entity118 , a neighbour , one - time team - mate and now the historian at @entity121 , where they played together in the youth side , recalls , it was @entity21 who organised the street matches and would ‘ mostly make himself captain ’			1
@entity21 ’s father worked at an oil company , so the family were more affluent than most in their neighbourhood			1
‘ we had the biggest car in the street , ’ @entity21 once said			1
‘ in the war my dad was the only one who had a car			2
he used to fetch potatoes 100 miles away in the south of the country for the people on our estate , who were starving			2
’ @entity35 was only 11 when his father died			2
‘ i hardly knew my dad , ’ he said			2
‘ i was six when he got sick			2
he died of a heart attack			2
’ early leader : @entity21 captained @entity8 in the mid- 1980s under @entity13 @entity21 lived at home with his mother until he was 21			1
‘ i never wanted to leave home as a student , ’ he recalled			0
‘ i was happy with my mum			0
my older brothers and sisters had left the house early			0
’ you can not be serious : @entity38 explodes at @entity157 in 1981 he was a decent footballer			1
but his ability on the ball was not enough to make up for a lack of pace that limited him to one non-competitive first - team appearance for @entity164 , who then boasted a certain @entity166			0
even now a degree of resentment exists between the two			0
aware that he could n’t make a living from football , @entity21 trained as a teacher			1
for 11 years he worked for the @entity173 school for children with learning difficulties			0
‘ one thing you could never accuse louis of is laziness , ’ says @entity13			1
‘ he was a very successful pe teacher			0
and he ’d be up at six to go to work in @entity48 and then drive to @entity8 for training with us at 2pm every day			0
‘ if i ’m honest , i never thought he would make a manager			0
@entity103 would come in and ask questions , but @entity35 would never say anything			0
i thought he ’d go back into teaching and maybe run an amateur team			0
i obviously did n’t imagine him coaching @entity189 , @entity164 , @entity190 , @entity29 and @entity73 ! ’ the discipline instilled in @entity21 by his family was something he continues to ask of his players			1
he can be outrageous , as when he famously dropped his trousers in the dressing room to demonstrate to his @entity190 players that he had the balls to make tough decisions			0
but he was also the @entity201 @entity200 , leading the players ’ union in the battle for higher wages			1
and until he took the @entity73 job he was the ambassador for a national children ’s charity ; a role that often reduced him to tears , even on live television			0
the @entity201 @entity200 : @entity21 ( centre ) led the players ' union in the battle for higher wages @entity21 has never lacked confidence			1
the way he introduced himself to the @entity190 players stands out			0
@entity218 : @entity21 celebrates @entity220 success as manager of @entity164 in 1995 ‘ @entity222 : self - confident , arrogant , dominant , honest , industrious , innovative , ’ he declared			1
not everyone responds well to that			0
he clashed with some at @entity189 because of his authoritarian style , @entity227 chief among them			1
@entity229 was hardly enamoured with him at @entity190 , while @entity230 had a similar experience at @entity164			1
in his first spell at @entity164 , during which the @entity48 club won the @entity220 in 1995 , @entity21 lost his wife @entity235 , mother of his two daughters , to cancer			1
he sees the private lives of his players as his business			0
@entity241 should certainly expect his new manager to show an interest			0
‘ @entity21 has a method of working with all his players ; not just on the training pitch , ’ the @entity29 winger @entity246 has said			1
‘ at club and international level he will invite players in			0
he wants to know all about your family , the way you grew up and what you do in your private life			0
but it is nothing to be scared of			0
’ then @entity21 will ask members of the @entity73 squad how they see themselves as players			1
‘ after a meal he will always have a talk or a chat , ’ says @entity164 centre back @entity262			0
‘ i now have a different picture of him			0
he had been portrayed to me as a right bully			0
and that he was way above the squad			0
‘ but once i was training and playing under him , i found out he was a brilliant guy to talk to			1
he makes jokes and respects every player			0
’ @entity262 says he has a great sense of humour			0
in the same address to the @entity190 players , he said : ‘ the man speaking to you now is the most irritating and arrogant football manager of @entity29			1
’ that got a laugh			0
contrary to what @entity13 says , @entity21 believes he was always destined to manage			1
refuelling : @entity241 on holiday in @entity283 two years ago - @entity21 will take an interest in his private life in one biography he recalled growing up in @entity48			1
‘ when we were 13 or 14 my classmates and i used to hop over to the @entity164 training grounds near our school , ’ he said			0
‘ all the other boys went for the signatures of players			0
i went to look at the manager			0
i wanted to know what he was doing in training sessions with the players			0
it was the first season of the new manager , @entity299			0
‘ there must have been a manager inside me , when i think of it now			0
’ the little boy who used to climb over the @entity164 fence wants to show the world how good he is			0
before moving to @entity73 to see if he can help the club move on from the @entity308 era			0
his history says he has the self - belief to succeed			0
@entity201 football television presenter @entity311 sums him up like this : ‘ @entity2 is a crazy man but i have to say he is capable of a lot			1
‘ it is just a pity that he knows so very well that he has such great qualities as a coach			0

@entity21 will manage @entity29 against @entity33 at @entity76 on friday
@entity201 is compared to @entity38 when playing tennis
@entity21 *'s* mentor @entity13 says he was ' a bit of a b * * * * * d '
@entity229 and @entity230 have both clashed with @entity201 boss
