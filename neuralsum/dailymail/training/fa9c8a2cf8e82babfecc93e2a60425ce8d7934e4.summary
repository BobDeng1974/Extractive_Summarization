by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 07:03 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 03:22 est , 30 july 2013 now let ’s see ... you ’re running the country while the pm is away and keen to get some good publicity after taking a recent hammering			0
so why not ditch the official @entity9 and meet the people on the commute into work ? better not to join the hordes on the sweaty tube , the river bus is much nicer on a lovely summer morning , even if it is more expensive			0
and , gosh , how lucky , a photographer just happens to be there to record your ‘ impromptu ’ trip as you swig coffee , chat to fellow commuters and exchange loving glances with your wife ... all smiles : @entity29 and wife @entity30 gaze at each other during a half hour boat trip to work this morning floating voter ? the @entity35 chat with another commuter yesterday lonely at the top : with @entity38 still on holiday in @entity40 , mr @entity29 is the most senior government minister in @entity41 at least in his open - neck shirt and expensive suit , @entity29 looked more at ease than @entity38 did on friday as he attempted the casual look on holiday in @entity40 with wife @entity47			1
the deputy prime minister and his wife @entity49 , a lawyer , were returning to work yesterday after their own break in @entity54			1
it was the first time mr @entity29 has used the river bus for the half - hour commute from his home in @entity59 , @entity60 , to his @entity41 office			1
but his ministerial car still had to make the trip , to carry paperwork for the @entity65 leader , who , @entity66 insists , is not running things as mr @entity38 ‘ remains in charge ’ – even on holiday			1
on wednesday mr @entity29 is expected to host the second of his new monthly press conferences , taking questions from journalists on any topic			0
by contrast mr @entity38 has faced criticism for not holding the ' take all - comers ' press conferences which became routine under @entity79 and @entity80			2
stepping out : the @entity35 were seen walking in the sunshine this morning while other commuters braved traffic jams and over-heated public transport rested : the couple have just returned from a week in @entity54 , where @entity49 's family are from as millions of people battled through traffic jams or the crush on trains and buses , mr @entity29 looked relaxed as he boarded the boat from his family home in @entity59 to @entity41			1
during the half hour river journey the @entity35 enjoyed coffee from @entity96 – notably snubbing @entity97 which has faced criticism for its low tax bill in @entity100			0
@entity66 has repeatedly stressed that mr @entity38 ' remains in charge ' wherever he is in the world			2
but mr @entity29 has encouraged the idea that senior ministers ' hold the fort ' when the pm is taking a break			0
the two men faced criticism after it emerged they would both be out of the country at the same time .			0

couple return to work in @entity60 after week - long holiday in @entity54
deputy pm is most senior minister in @entity41 while @entity38 is away
prime minister is in @entity40 with wife @entity47 and 3 *children*
