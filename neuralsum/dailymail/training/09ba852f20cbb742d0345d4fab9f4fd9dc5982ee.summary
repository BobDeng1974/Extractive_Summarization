hands off in the box is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box			0
whether it is wrestling , grappling , shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the @entity10 vs @entity12 match - the area has become a free - for - all for cheating			1
and that means fewer goals in the @entity16			0
for too long , referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring			0
it 's time to end that			2
so join us in our campaign to say @entity24 to players and referees			0
we ’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it			0
a few years ago , during a promotional event with some journalists at @entity35 ’s @entity34 training ground , one of the world ’s finest central defenders made his way into the penalty area to wait for a corner			1
as the ball was launched in , he pulled down hard on his marker ’s shirt on the blindside of the referee to prevent his opponent jumping and used it to propel himself into the air			2
he scored with a header easily enough and made the sap on the end of it look like he did n’t fancy aerial combat with a top class centre half ( true , as it happened )			0
@entity58 ran away chuckling , laughing at the naivety more than anything ( plus the fact he had swapped sides at half - time with his team leading 5 - 0 and had brought it back to five - all )			1
for the avoidance of doubt this is not an attack on @entity58 ’s integrity because he is one of the finest defenders this country has produced			1
at 33 he is playing better than ever in @entity12 colours			1
he did , however , provide a fascinating insight into the tricks of the trade used by players competing at the very highest level			1
stuff goes on and the players just hope to hell that the referee does n’t spot it or , if he does , lets you get away with it			2
which brings us nicely to the official @entity89 , the poor fella who is still being given a good kicking three days on from @entity10 ’s 1 - 1 draw with @entity12			1
on sunday afternoon , in the seconds before @entity93 ’s dramatic equaliser for @entity10 , a text message arrived from the boss : ‘ are you mad ? ! ’			1
@entity89 had his work cut out at @entity97 on sunday trying to spot all the grappling and wrestling sat in the @entity102 ’s @entity101 office he was reacting to a tweet , sent from the press box at @entity97 , that had the audacity to praise @entity89 ’s performance involving two highly - charged teams who did not want to give an inch			1
here is the offending tweet : ‘ this is n’t terribly fashionable to say , but @entity89 has refereed this game brilliantly ’			1
in the marks awarded on @entity114 , @entity89 was given an eight out of 10			1
that ’s a decent mark in the biggest game of the season and more than any of the players or the managers received			0
what a crime that turned out to be on an afternoon when people were not quite sure who was man of the match and who had the upper hand			0
still , when in doubt , give the referee the mother of all kickings			2
sitting at home , or in the office , it is easy to re-referee a football match when there are 26 ( sometimes more ) cameras inside a stadium			0
@entity58 holds on to @entity137 while defending a corner against @entity10 @entity58 grabs @entity137 while the @entity139 holds @entity141 's shirt and the @entity142 gives some back those replays , plus the commentary , along with full - time and half - time analysis , do n’t half come in handy			1
@entity58 and @entity148 were ‘ double headlocked ’ at ever corner according to @entity12 ’s captain			1
the pictures of the pair grappling with @entity153 and @entity137 backed him up			0
@entity89 was given an eight for , by and large , keeping these warring teams on the straight and narrow by issuing eight yellow cards and dismissing @entity148			1
the default mechanism in the game is thus : there is a man in authority , so give him the coating because the @entity165 , the match officials ’ guardian angels , prevent the poor sucker defending himself in a post-match press conference			0
match officials are soft , soft targets			0
@entity58 is bundled to the floor by @entity171 ( right ) as @entity153 wrestles with @entity148 ( centre ) as reporters , we will never have to justify ourselves to @entity89 , or any other match official , because we rarely come across them ( apart from a nod and a handshake at @entity178 on international weeks )			1
the players and managers are different because we are more likely to come across them in press conferences or in mixed zones down by the tunnel area			0
@entity184 believed @entity185 was @entity10 ’s best player in the first half			2
by the time he was substituted in the 66th minute he had touched the ball just 35 times			0
@entity189 , the man who smothered @entity190 and is now apparently fully acclimatised to life at @entity10 , had the third worst passing record in the home team			2
@entity190 , subdued it has to be said , was upgraded to a seven because he provided the killer ball for @entity196 to put @entity12 in front			1
goals pay the rent and all that			0
@entity89 ( right ) lays down the law to a smiling @entity190 during the clash at @entity97 @entity89 dismisses @entity148 ( left ) for a second bookable offence after a foul on @entity204 ( right ) back to @entity89			2
to put his performance at @entity97 into perspective , the @entity165 asked a 51 - year - old man to make key decisions when he is trying to keep up with twenty - something footballers who often hoover 100 metres in less than 11 seconds			0
in addition we are asking a guy who is usually on the move to make the correct decision in a top class sporting arena with 22 players launching themselves into a full - bloodied contact in all areas of the pitch			2
sat in the office , the boss will benefit from the 26 or more cameras stationed at @entity97 to help the broadcaster , in this case @entity225 , come to a conclusion			0
was @entity89 right ? ‘ well let ’s take a look at the replay ... ’			2

@entity58 provided insight into tricks during event at @entity35 years ago
@entity89 was given a kicking ( although not by this reporter ) after his *display* during @entity10 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity12
it 's easy to have a go at a referee when you have benefit of replays
how 's official meant to see everything that happens on pitch ?
