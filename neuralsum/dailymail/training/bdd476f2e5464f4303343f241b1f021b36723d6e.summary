by @entity1 reporter published : 16:53 est , 7 december 2012 updated : 17:24 est , 7 december 2012 the potential end of the world on december 21 , as predicted by the @entity3 calendar , has generated a mixture of different reactions from people			1
for some the famous date is an excuse for a party , others are simply treating it as another day , while one group of people - known as ' preppers ' - have been stocking up on supplies in expectation of the apocalypse			1
now @entity23 authorities , in a bid to quell fears of doomsday , have issued light - hearted advice on how best to respond to the potential crisis , such as installing a fire alarm and listening out for weather forecasts			1
end of the world ? opinion is divided about an apparant @entity3 prediction that the world will end on dec 21 on it ’s website , @entity32 has posted the following explanation for why the world wo n’t end on december 21 , 2012 : contrary to some of the common beliefs out there , the claims behind the @entity40 quickly unravel when pinned down to the 2012 timeline			1
the story started with claims that @entity44 , a supposed planet discovered by the @entity46 , is headed toward @entity47			1
this catastrophe was initially predicted for may 2003 , but when nothing happened the doomsday date was moved forward to december 2012 and linked to the end of one of the cycles in the ancient @entity3 calendar at the winter solstice in 2012 - hence the predicted doomsday date of december 21 , 2012			1
the world will not end in 2012			1
our planet has been getting along just fine for more than four billion years , and credible scientists worldwide know of no threat associated with 2012			1
the deadpan advice comes with less than two weeks to go until the date of the apocalypse , according to some interpretations of the @entity54			1
it follows an official @entity68 government blog this week , which described the prediction that a planet is on a crash course with @entity47 as ' just rumours ' and insisted that ' the world will not end on december 21 , 2012 , or any day in 2012 '			2
what form annihilation will take remains the topic of hot speculation on the internet , with possible scenarios ranging from a @entity79 - like great flood to a rogue planet smashing into @entity47			2
the @entity23 institutions confirmed they had the necessary capacity to deal with any unusual events that might occur and , with tongues firmly in cheeks , put forward some specific suggestions for survival			1
a @entity89 spokesman said : ' fit a smoke alarm on each level of your home , then at least you might stand a chance of knowing that the end of the world is nigh ahead of those who do n’t			1
' if you survive the apocalypse you ’ll be alerted to a fire more quickly should one ever break out			1
' the @entity100 advised : ' before heading off , take time to do the basic checks on your car and allow extra time for your journey			1
' local radio is a good source of traffic and weather updates and for any warnings of an impending apocalypse			1
should the announcer break such solemn news , try to remain focused on the road ahead and keep your hands on the wheel			2
' an @entity119 spokesman added : ' luckily for animals , they do not have the same fears of the future - or its imminent destruction - as us humans , so it is unlikely that our pets will be worrying about the @entity40			1
' however , should the @entity129 prove to be right , our message would be to spend whatever time you have left with your animals wisely			1
lighthearted advice for coping with the @entity40 includes fitting extra smoke detectors and listening to weather forecasts on the radio ancient signs : the doomsday fears are based on misinterpretations of the @entity3 calendar , say @entity32 ' take them for a long walk or give them a cuddle			1
enjoy every second you have with them as if it was your last ! ' other bodies including @entity149 and @entity150 confirmed they were prepared for any event that may occur on december 21			2
however , one expert offered reassurance that the prediction was a misinterpretation of ancient artefacts			2
professor @entity157 , the author of 2012 : science and prophecy of the @entity160 , traces the start of the 2012 apocalypse prophecy back to 1904 , when @entity164 scholars said a @entity3 picture of a sky dragon pouring water from above proved they were predicting a great flood			2
other predictions then made it into subsequent academic books on the @entity172 and soon became enshrined in popular mythology			2
the @entity119 has recommended spending quality time with pets should a @entity3 prophecy about the @entity40 come true on dec 21 prof @entity157 , who teaches art history at @entity178 , @entity179 , said the speculation comes down to a few inscriptions that indicate the @entity54 has been counting down since @entity182 and will hit zero on december 21			1
he told the @entity183 : ' the @entity172 indicated there was a 5,000 - year cycle that ended on a creation date			2
scholars , and eventually everyone else , inferred that when the calendar reached that date again in 2012 that it would stop			2
' when i started writing my book , i thought that i would find evidence to support the scholarly idea that the clock would actually stop this time			1
but in fact i found no evidence the @entity172 ever thought that			2
i found several examples that suggest the opposite			2
' when the calendar reaches zero on december 21 it will just restart , according to prof @entity157			2
he added : ' i say this to people who are believers : okay , have a great time , i ’ll see you in 2013			1
' the @entity172 did not predict any end			0
the @entity172 expected the future to go on for ever			0
' @entity32 scientists say fears about the impending end of the world are based on misinterpretations of the @entity3 calendar numerous websites and @entity219 groups promoting the @entity3 prediction and providing so - called evidence can be found online			1
a small @entity223 village called @entity224 has been earmarked by some as the only place to go to guarantee surviving the apocalypse			0
the december 21 apocalypse is not the first prediction and it is unlikely to be the last , if prof @entity157 proves correct			0
the countdown to the millennium was awash with fears that the y2k bug would send computer systems into meltdown with devastating consequences			1
such was the uncertainty over what would happen when the clock struck midnight that then president @entity242 signed into law the @entity245 to help businesses prepare			0
then there was @entity68 pastor @entity248 , who predicted @entity249 not once but twice last year			0
yet both may 21 and october 21 , 2011 passed without incident			0
the scouts are renowned for always being prepared for a crisis			0
here @entity253 , assistant director of the @entity251 , gives his top tips for surviving an apocalypse			0
get into a team : ' you need to work with others to survive			0
you are stronger together as a team because you have complementary sets of skills			0
' one person might be particularly good at building shelters , another setting traps			0
it is about pooling skills and experience			0
if you are thinking about setting off alone , find some friends and quickly			0
' not only does your physical condition depend on it , your mental health will too			0
humans are tribal people and they work better in teams having people to talk to			0
' brush up on basic skills : ' if you are a @entity277 , you know how to light a fire , how to cook , how to make a shelter			1
those basic skills are really important and you can learn them very quickly			0
' there are probably going to be no computers or electricity in the post-apocalyptic world so get a basic essential guide , there are loads around in the library			0
' @entity291 was written in 1908 but it will still be relevant after the apocalypse			0
it is the most likely tool for survival that people can find easily			0
' come up with a plan : ' you need both a short - term plan and a long - term plan			0
in the short term , it is about getting food , water and shelter			0
in the long term , you need to think about what you are going to do in two , three , four , five years ’ time			1
' having enthusiasm and a plan gives hope , and hope keeps you alive			0
the longer - term plan is about creating a better and more tolerant world			0
i know that sounds terrible esoteric if you ’re in a world that has just finished , but that is what gives you hope for the future			0
