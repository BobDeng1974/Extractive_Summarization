prime minister @entity0 has described stopping the boats as the ' most compassionate ' thing his government could have done			1
mr @entity0 was trumpeting the success of @entity5 at the @entity7 state conference in @entity8 on saturday when he made the comment , adding that secure borders were a sign of a sovereign nation			1
stopping the boats meant an end to budget blowouts , saving billions in unnecessary future spending and ending deaths , the prime minister said			1
prime minister @entity0 described stopping the boats as the ' most compassionate ' thing his government could have done at the @entity7 at the @entity17 in @entity8 on saturday ' that 's why the most decent and most compassionate thing this government has done is to ensure that for more than six months now there has been no successful people smuggling venture to our country , ' mr @entity0 told the conference			1
' i am not declaring victory , but my friends we are stopping those boats			0
' the prime ministers comments come less than a week after the @entity32 prevented the government from handing 153 asylum seekers back to the @entity36 authorities by granting an interim injunction			1
the action was handed out after a number barristers brought the claim before the @entity32 , with solicitor @entity41 in particular speaking out against the risks asylum seekers face when being returned to their home countries where they face possible persecution			2
' the [ immigration ] minister can not simply intercept their vessel in the middle of the night and " disappear them " , ' mr @entity41 told @entity52 in relation to a boat of 41 asylum seekers who face criminal investigation after the @entity58 government returned them to @entity36			1
a member of the security team pushes an anti-government protester outside the convention a short time before mr @entity0 was scheduled to speak ' the asylum seekers claim that they are fleeing persecution and that they 're at risk of death , torture or significant harm at the hands of @entity36 authorities , ' mr @entity41 said			1
' [ there 's ] a need for ongoing protection			0
' the prime minister also made no mention of the ' compassionate ' state of detention centres , in which claims emerged last week about nine mothers on @entity79 who attempted self harm in the hope their children would by allowed to stay in the country			1
also contrasting the prime ministers words , dozens of people gathered outside the conference to protest against @entity87 and started yelling , ' @entity88 , @entity89 , shame ' when they heard foreign minister @entity89 had arrived			2
a member of the security team was also photographed pushing at one of the activists			0
but ms @entity89 said they should be supporting the government 's humanitarian efforts			2
' there is nothing humanitarian about encouraging criminal people to pay criminal syndicates to get on unseaworthy boats and take a dangerous journey to @entity58 , ' ms @entity89 said			0
in contrast of the prime ministers words , a number of people attended the event to protest some of the government 's policies , including its treatment of refugees ' they should have been protesting when 1200 people died at sea under the previous government 's policies			2
' that was a disaster and we do n't intend to have that happen under our watch			0
' mr @entity0 also admitted at the conference , that it had been an ' interesting week ' in the @entity122 , after the @entity124 's last minute antics put the kibosh on the government 's plans to repeal the carbon tax by thursday			2
but instead on focusing on @entity124 leader @entity130 's involvement , he pointed to @entity132 's reluctance to to rid @entity58 of the tax			0
' sure mr @entity130 has three senators , but mr @entity135 has 25 , ' mr @entity0 said			0
' and we know that mr @entity130 will change his mind by monday , but @entity135 will still be there come monday , come tuesday , come next week , come next month , come next year , supporting putting your power prices up			0
smiling every time your power bill increases			0
