the @entity9 is reporting that @entity10 , one of president @entity12 's top advisers , leaked details of the story to the press through outside sources hoping it would not trace back to the @entity17			1
what 's more , the entire thing was timed to become public just as @entity20 was planning to announce her candidacy for president			2
' they believe that @entity3 , like her husband , is left of center , not a true - blue liberal			0
' sources claim that the long rumored tension between @entity12 and the @entity52 hit a high when during the midterm elections many members of the party refused to be seen campaigning with president @entity12			1
@entity40 is reported to have commented this was because the @entity52 had begun ' marginalizing the president ' and that they were ' trying to wrestle control of the @entity61 away from @entity12			1
' because of this she reportedly went out of her way to exact revenge , working to get @entity66 high profile press opportunities and frequently complaining about the @entity52			2
then , shortly after the midterm elections , she , president @entity12 and @entity67 had @entity20 in for a meeting and reportedly told her in no uncertain words that they planned on remaining neutral during the presidential primary should she run for president			1

' he then added ; ' the @entity90 are behind the e-mail story , and they ’re spreading rumors that i ’ve been with women , that @entity3 promoted people at the @entity107 who ’d done favors for our foundation , that @entity111 had to clean up diplomatic messes @entity3 left behind			0
' it seems like it is not over yet either , as there are reportedly six more probes currently going on that are looking into @entity20 's performance			2
@entity93 , upon learning of this , reportedly said to a friend ; ' the @entity90 are out to get us any way they can			0
