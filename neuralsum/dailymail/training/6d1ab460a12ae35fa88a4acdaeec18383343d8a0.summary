as @entity2 digested the results of the @entity2 midterm elections yesterday , one person on @entity1 seemed to be more interested in ice hockey than politics			0
it has been revealed that somewhere in @entity9 a person was editing @entity13 legend @entity12 's @entity11 - changing his height from 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet			1
twitter account @ @entity15 , which tracks anonymous @entity11 edits made from @entity9 ip addresses noted the change and posted in on social media			1
somewhere in congress a person was editing @entity13 legend @entity12 's wikipedia page yesterday incidentally , it appears that whoever made the edit did actually change the page to reflect @entity12 's correct height , which @entity13 also puts at 6 feet			1
and this is n't the first time someone in congress has been caught making @entity11 edits			2
earlier this year , @entity11 put a ten - day total ban on edits made from computers within @entity9 after humorous changes were made to notable people 's profiles , and other edits promoted conspiracy theories			1
changes to the page of @entity41 claimed that he assassinated president @entity43 ' on behalf of the regime of @entity45 ' and former @entity2 defense secretary @entity46 is described as a ' lizard alien '			0
a representative from the @entity1 building said that the ban was caused by the actions of ' two or three ' and was drawn to attention by @ congressedits			0
earlier this year , @entity11 put a ten - day total ban on all edits made from computers within @entity9 the changes were brought to the attention of @entity11 administrators when an edit was made from a @entity62 for the website @entity64 , calling the media blog ' sexist ' and ' transphobic ' and alleging that it ' automatically assumes that someone is male without any evidence			1
' the website had written a story beforehand about the false edits coming from computers in the @entity1 building			0
@entity72 , the founder of @entity11 , told the @entity73 at the time that he was far from shocked by the edits and that it has ' always gone and it always will '			2
however , he did say that the @entity76 feed may have been responsible in part for some of the more outrageous edits			0
it turns out ice hockey star @entity12 is 6 feet tall , and not 5 feet 10 inches as @entity11 previously stated ' there is a belief from some of the @entity85 that it only provoked someone - some prankster there in the office - to have an audience now for the pranks , and actually encouraged them rather than discouraged them			1
' he added to the @entity73 : ' maybe someone at the @entity95 better think about their it staff - they might be hunting them down this very moment			0
' it emerged that @entity11 has been warning users from @entity9 since march 2012			2
@entity11 can be edited by an user any time and anonymously , but the changes are monitored by the website 's volunteers , known as @entity85			2
they reverse rogue editing and sometimes ban users who continually change entries .			0

anonymous person edited @entity12 's height from 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet
the edit , to the correct height , noted by @ @entity76 account
earlier this year , @entity11 put a ten - day ban on edits made from @entity9
