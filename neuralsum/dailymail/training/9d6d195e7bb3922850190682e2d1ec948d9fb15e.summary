in a speaking test , liars were able to spot other liars far more accurately than people who told the truth - which might explain why poker players are good at both			0
oddly , the ability is n't related to @entity18 or emotional intelligence - the ability to lie is a separate thing			1

' it is not uncommon to hearof ‘ poachers turned gamekeepers ’ , such as infamous confidence - trickster , @entity42 , who is now an @entity44 financial fraud consultant , ' say the researchers			0
what is more mystifying is that the liars and non-liars are of similar intelligence level - ie it 's not a simple difference in intellectual ability			2
the ability to deceive seems to be separate - although it 's not clear whether people are born with it , or learn it			2
' a significant relationship was found between the deception - related abilities ; those who could accurately detect a lie were able to produce statements that others found difficult to classify as deceptive or truthful , ' say the researchers			2
' furthermore , neither ability was related to measures of intelligence or emotional ability			1
we , therefore , suggest the existence of an underlying deception - general ability that varies across individuals			0
