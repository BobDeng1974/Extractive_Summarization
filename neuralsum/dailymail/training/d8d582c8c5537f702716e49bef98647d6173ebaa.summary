by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:58 est , 8 october 2012 updated : 01:50 est , 9 october 2012 a private rocket successfully sent a capsule full of cargo zipping to the @entity5 , but the craft could n't deliver on job @entity7 : putting a commercial satellite into the correct orbit			1
one of nine engines on the @entity15 company 's @entity13 rocket failed on sunday - 79 seconds after launch due to a loss in pressure			1
the engine did n't explode , but it did start a series of events that meant another company 's private satellite is not in the place it is needed			1
@entity15 on monday said the ship 's flight computer calculated a new path to the station for the capsule			1
it is the first of a dozen supply runs under a mega-contract with @entity51			0
' @entity13 did exactly what it was designed to do , ' the @entity52 based @entity15 said			1
' like the @entity54 , which experienced engine loss on two flights , @entity13 is designed to handle an engine out situation and still complete its mission			1
' but not all of its mission			0
problem : the engine did n't explode , but it did start a series of events that meant @entity66 's private satellite , sending it into a lower orbit than what was intended set for the stars : the @entity13 rocket and @entity42 taking off from the @entity71 , @entity72 the original plan was for @entity13 to fire its second stage engines after @entity75 left and then deploy an industrial communications satellite into orbit for @entity66 , @entity78			1
because this is a new resupply ship for the space station , @entity51 and its international partners had set detailed safety rules in advance for @entity13 , even though the engine failure was far from the station			1
and those rules prevent @entity15 from firing its second stage engines , @entity66 said in a statement			1
the satellite is in a lower orbit and engineers are trying to figure out how to boost it , @entity66 said			1
up and away : the @entity13 rocket and @entity42 lift off from the @entity94 launch complex on its way : the rocket is flying in pursuit of the @entity5 this was the first of 18 satellites that @entity66 had hired @entity15 to deliver			1
the satellites help in two - way communications for companies to track their heavy equipment across the world			0
the company would n't respond to questions about the cost of the satellite or launch services			1
@entity113 astronomer @entity112 , who tracks launches worldwide , noticed the problem for hours before either company acknowledged that the satellite was in the wrong orbit			2
even though @entity15 was congratulating itself after the launch , @entity112 said : ' we ca n't say that it was a perfect launch			1
' lit up : the @entity122 illuminated the sky as it made its ascent a 71 - second exposure of @entity15 's @entity13 rocket successfully launching - as seen from @entity127 the commercial cargo ship rocketed into orbit on sunday , the first of a dozen supply runs to the space station under a mega-contract with @entity51			1
it was the second launch of a @entity75 capsule to the orbiting lab by the @entity52 - based @entity15 company			1
the first was last spring			0
this time was no test flight , however , and the spacecraft carried 1,000 pounds of key science experiments and other precious gear			0
there was also a personal touch : chocolate - vanilla swirl ice cream tucked in a freezer for the three station residents			0
@entity15 employees watch the @entity13 rocket and dragon capsule launch on sunday evening the @entity13 rocket is bringing cargo to the @entity5 including equipment , science experiment and ice cream @entity51 is counting on private business to restock the space station , now that the shuttles have retired to museums			1
the space agency has a $ 1.6billion contract with @entity15 for 12 resupply missions			2
especially exciting for @entity51 is the fact that the @entity75 will return twice as much cargo as it took up , including a stockpile of astronauts ' blood and urine samples			2
the samples - nearly 500 of them - have been stashed in freezers since @entity172 made the last shuttle flight in july 2011			0
' while it may seem very strange to some folks , my typical line is that , " it may be urine to you , but it 's gold to us , " ' said @entity51 nutritionist @entity181			2
' there 's a lot of science that comes out of this			2
' @entity75 will spend close to three weeks at the space station before being released and parachuting into the @entity187 at the end of october			0
by then , the space station should be back up to a full crew of six			0
none of the @entity193 , @entity194 or @entity195 cargo ships can bring anything back ; they 're destroyed during re-entry			2
the @entity193 @entity200 crew capsules have limited room for anything besides people			0
all together : the private launch is hoped to be the first of more to come at @entity71 with @entity15 photographing a sign of encouragement to their team on saturday @entity15 , or @entity15 - owned by @entity211 co-founder @entity210 - is working to convert its unmanned @entity75 capsules into vessels that could carry astronauts to the space station in three years			1
other @entity217 companies also are vying to carry crews			0
americans must ride @entity193 rockets to orbit in the meantime , for a steep price			2
@entity51 's space station program manager , @entity225 , is thrilled about having an @entity217 spacecraft bearing goods			0
it 's much easier to get last - minute equipment aboard a @entity217 capsule , he noted			0
@entity75 , for example , will carry up a new pump for the space station 's urine - into - drinking water recycling system			0
a 30 second camera exposure shows @entity13 rocket attached to the cargo - only capsule called @entity75 as it lifts off the unmanned @entity13 rocket roared into the night sky on sunday evening , putting @entity15 on track to reach the space station wednesday ' shipping and customs can kill you when you 're trying to get overseas , ' @entity225 said			1
@entity210 , who monitored the launch from @entity246 in @entity247 , @entity52 , called the capsules @entity75 after the magical @entity249 to get back at critics who , a decade ago , considered his effort a fantasy			0
the name @entity13 comes from the @entity255 starship of @entity257 fame			2
an estimated 2,400 guests jammed the launching center to see the @entity13 , with its @entity75 , come to life for @entity15 's first official , operational supply mission			1
' just over a year since shuttle retirement , to be able to do that is , i think , what people are very excited about , ' said @entity51 's deputy administrator , @entity268			0
people watch as the @entity13 rocket attached to the cargo - only capsule called @entity75 is raised into launch position across the country at @entity15 headquarters , about 1,000 employees watched via tv and webcast			1
@entity15 is shooting for its next supply run in january			2
another company looking to haul space station cargo , @entity78 's @entity281 , hopes to launch a solo test flight in december and a demo mission to the station early next year			2
@entity51 , meanwhile , expects to name within a few weeks the @entity217 astronaut and @entity193 cosmonaut who will spend an entire year aboard the space station , beginning in spring 2015 , twice the usual length for a mission			0
@entity225 said the list of potential candidates is ' very short			0
' another @entity51 official said only previous space station crew members are under consideration for the two slots because they 're already trained in the systems of the orbiting complex			0
on friday , the space agency said it would commit to a yearlong mission to learn what it will take for humans to journey beyond low - earth orbit â€” @entity305 , for example			0
three cosmonauts spent at least a year aboard the old @entity307 ; the record for single stint is almost 15 months			0
no @entity217 has spent more than seven months in space at a time			0
@entity15 's @entity13 rocket prepares for launch from @entity71 , @entity72 , to the @entity5			1

one of nine engines shut down during rocket 's launch
while the faulty engine did not explode , it rendered the craft unable to put an @entity66 satellite into the proper orbit
@entity15 's @entity13 rockets is still expected to complete its trip to the @entity5 to bring supplies to astronauts
