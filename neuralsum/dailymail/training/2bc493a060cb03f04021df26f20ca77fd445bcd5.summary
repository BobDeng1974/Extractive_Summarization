as the three thin needles at the tip of what looks like a futuristic electric toothbrush start to fur up with ice , i begin to feel a bit queasy			1
these needles will be jabbed into my face , to freeze and disable - albeit temporarily - the nerve that enables me to lift my eyebrows			1
am i mad ? not entirely			0
getting the needle : @entity13 has the @entity15 treatment , the latest botox - alternative to banish wrinkles ( its makers claim ) this is the ' world 's first toxin - free treatment for dynamic facial lines ' , aka the latest botox - alternative to banish your wrinkles , which has just launched in the @entity24			1
having followed the treatment 's progress for the past year , i 've been mad keen to be the first journalist to try it			2
instead of injecting toxins into the face , this technique uses ' @entity32 ' to - literally - freeze wrinkles into submission			1
it works instantly so , unlike @entity37 , there 's no waiting around for a week to see if your eyebrows will end up wonky			0
and the results should last for around three months , until the frozen section of the nerve regrows			2
as with any new procedure that promises to be an alternative to @entity37 , there has been huge interest in @entity15			1
despite the fact that @entity37 has an impressive safety record and has been used and studied extensively for almost 40 years , it is still not to everyone 's liking - usually because people do n't want to have a toxin injected into them , even in tiny amounts			2
although there are several competing technologies that take the freezing approach , dubbed things like ' cold tox ' or ' @entity60 ' , @entity15 appears to be the most reputable of them all			1
so , ignoring the advice i frequently dish out about not trying new procedures before they have been extensively tested , i elbowed my way to the front of the queue			0
' @entity15 is a good alternative for people who do n't want actual @entity37 , ' says dr @entity70 , a well - known @entity71 cosmetic surgeon - he 's been on tv 's @entity72 - and @entity15 's head practitioner for the @entity24			1
before and after : after eight cycles , there is little sign of the treatment he has been conducting official trials on the technique for the past year			2
' overall i 'm happy with it , ' he says			0
ninety per cent of his trial group saw good results , he tells me , but the treatment had little or no effect on the other 10 per cent			2
most women in this group were enthusiastic			0
' it 's amazing ! ' one has said			0
' it 's so fast , the results are instant , and my forehead looks really smooth yet natural			0
' he tells me the procedure , properly known as ' cryoneuromodulation ' , was created by @entity99 company @entity98 , and that its patented ' @entity32 ' procedure has already received @entity102 approval for pain relief in the @entity99 @entity102 trials for the cosmetic , wrinkle - freezing aspect of the technique are into their final stages			2
he shows me the sleek @entity15 device with those needles sticking out at the end			1
these needles are inserted into the skin near the path of the nerve that controls the frontalis , the muscle that raises the eyebrows			1
to chill the nerve , liquid nitrogen is passed into the needles ( but not the skin )			1
dr @entity70 presses the button to demonstrate and i watch aghast as the probes fur up with ice			0
am i being stupid to try this at such an early stage ? i canvass opinions from experts in the beauty industry , who sounded notes of caution			0
' the three mainstream @entity132 toxins [ @entity37 , @entity133 and @entity134 ] work so well and so consistently that regular users have no compelling reason to switch , ' says @entity137 , an adviser on cosmetic surgery and skincare			2
especially to something that will last no longer and is no less expensive			0
she adds : ' the real potential of this technology lies in treating pain and headaches			0
' cosmetic dermatologist dr @entity146 was even less enthusiastic			0
' this is not a treatment you can easily fine - tune , ' she says , ' because you 're inhibiting the nerve , rather than targeting individual muscles			1
that 's a bit like attacking the tree at its trunk to get an apple off a branch			0
' @entity132 toxin has become such a sophisticated treatment that we can reshape brows , widen the eyes and minimise facial asymmetries , while preserving natural movement			2
' because @entity15 currently only treats the frontalis muscle , the only muscle that lifts our eyebrows up , the risk of ending up with a heavy , angry - looking , dropped brow and upper eyelids seems high			1
@entity15 seems like a retrograde step			1
' i have had @entity37 on and off for the past decade and have a love / hate relationship with it			0
i love the way it can smooth lines and make my face look fresher , but hate not being able to move my forehead			2
so i end up having just a bit in between my eyebrows , and leave the horizontal lines on my forehead to their own devices			0
i have a gut feeling that i ought to stick with the devil i know , but curiosity gets the better of me			0
before he can start my treatment , dr @entity70 has to pinpoint the correct nerve pathway , using a @entity190 machine , used for pain - relief , that stimulates nerves with electric currents			1
he hits the right nerve , and my eyebrow starts to twitch			1
next come pinprick injections of lidocaine , a local anaesthetic to numb the area			0
i feel only a small amount of pressure as the needles are plugged into my skin			1
deep freeze : though @entity15 may not use any toxins ( unlike @entity37 ) , @entity13 recommends holding off on using the treatment until more is known about its efficacy when the chill - down cycle starts , it feels painful , rather than cold			1
not agonising , but the 60 seconds that the cycle lasts seem long			0
my eyebrow can still move as normal , so dr @entity70 delivers another dose of focused cold a fraction further along the nerve pathway - but i still ca n't see any difference - and moves to my left side			1
there , it simply does n't work			0
after six cycles , dr @entity70 goes back to the right side			0
one more cycle and my right eyebrow ca n't move at all			2
i wiggle my eyebrows , and only one responds , @entity226 - style			2
back on the left side , two more shots fail to subdue the eyebrow			2
dr @entity70 has to leave it as eight cycles is the maximum dose - though there is no bruising and little trace of the treatment , apart neat prong - marks vanishing into my hairline			1
does this happen often ? apparently not - only one in ten of dr @entity70 ' trial group complained of slight asymmetry			0
to my own eyes , i look bizarre , but over the next week , before i go back to have another two cycles of treatment which quell my left brow , no one notices - not my family , or the beauty editors i work with , or even the cosmetic practitioners i see at the industry 's big annual shindig			1
even good old @entity37 has left me looking lop - sided in the past			0
but , now i 've had both sides successfully treated , i will have a poker - face , or at least a poker - brow , until september			1
or longer , if some experts are to be believed			0
while the people behind @entity15 insist the nerves grow back , critics have warned me that this nerve damage could be permanent			1
so , should you try this treatment ? my honest advice is not yet			0
the technology is fascinating and @entity15 may yet become the best wrinkle - fixer since time began , but right now , it 's still early days			1
@entity15 treatments cost Â£ 500 from dr @entity70 , 111 @entity71 , @entity269 , 111harleystreet.com			1

instead of injecting toxins into the face , @entity15 freezes wrinkles
needles are inserted into the skin near the nerve that raises the eyebrow
the treatment is still being trialed - but @entity281 gives it a go anyway
