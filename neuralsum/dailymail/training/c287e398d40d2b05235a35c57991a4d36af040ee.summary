by @entity1 reporter published : 15:55 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 16:57 est , 24 january 2014 a historic @entity4 town could be reduced to whisper if a strict new noise ordinance is passed			1
@entity7 , which lies just south of @entity8 , is considering rules that would fine residents who made over 55 decibels of noise during the day and more than 45 decibels at night			1
technically you could be fined $ 100 for your first offense for being louder than a coffee percolator ( 55 db ) , a refrigerator ( 50 db ) or even just more than normal conversation ( 60 db ) , according to a decibel chart			1
be quiet ! @entity19 at the center of historic @entity7 , @entity4 , a town that is considering a very strict noise ordinance danger : the proposed law could fine residents for making noise above 55 decibels - normal conversation rates at around 60db ' it 's really a question of giving police some tools to deal with a quality of life issue , ' @entity28 chairman @entity27 told @entity34			1
@entity7 town authorities get around 350 complaints a year , with the most in july			2
the ordinance , which can seen on the town 's website , remains very much a proposal at the moment , but it would also ban construction noise in residential areas between 7pm and 7am			2
power tools would not be permitted between 8pm and 7pm			0
noise above the limits would be permitted during the day for no more than 15 minutes in an hour			2
lawn mowers , snow blowers and tractors are all louder than 55 decibels			1
clearing up : under the rules , snow blowers could only be used for 15 minutes in an hour exceptions would be made with certain permits and in emergency situations			0
but under the new rules residents would be fined $ 100 for a first offense , $ 200 for the second and $ 300 for the third and any thereafter			2
@entity58 discussed the proposal on thursday after putting it out for public discussion and they are now working on the document following comments			0
selectman @entity64 told the @entity66 : ' i do n't think it 's ready for prime time yet			0
' some residents of the town were concerned about the possible law change			0
@entity73 , who is in the landscaping business , did n't agree with the idea that loud noises could last no longer than 15 minutes in an hour			0
@entity77 : under the new rules , town residents would be fined $ 100 for a first offense , $ 200 for the second and $ 300 for the third and any thereafter ' for many houses in this town , it will take longer than 15 minutes to mow a lawn , ' he told the paper			0
and local man @entity87 of @entity88 to the @entity66 : ' it does kind of seem that we are killing a flea with a sledgehammer here			1

' it does kind of seem that we are killing a flea with a sledgehammer here , ' said one resident
