@entity0 says that the additional games on @entity2 for @entity4 clubs could make this @entity6 third round one of the most exciting yet			1
@entity0 , who won the @entity6 with @entity8 in 2007 , will make extensive changes for the game against @entity11 at @entity12 on sunday			1
and the @entity8 manager says that the fact that the @entity16 clubs did not have a game on @entity2 , unlike the @entity4 , means that the ties will be evened up			1
‘ but at the same time normally the @entity4 clubs have more potential and more qualities , so maybe it ’s a way to make things level			1
one team has more quality and another team is fresh and ready for the game so maybe this is a way to level things between @entity4 teams and the @entity35 teams			1
‘ we do n’t have to analyse whether it ’s fair or not fair – it ’s the way it is			2
in relation to fixtures and accumulation of matches and fatigue and this kind of thing , it is the way it is , so we have to accept that			2
’ and @entity0 has refused to use the exceptionally - busy @entity64 period for the @entity4 , which sees @entity8 playing their fifth game in 15 days on sunday , as an excuse for the 5 - 3 defeat to @entity68 on @entity2			1
@entity8 host @entity11 in the @entity6 on sunday , after their 5 - 3 league defeat at @entity68 on @entity2 ‘ it the same for everybody , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ when it ’s for everybody , you have to accept it			0
you know it ’s difficult for the players but it is not difficult for my players , it is difficult for every player			0
my respect to every player of every club because it ’s hard to do it			0
it ’s the only country where they do it ( the @entity64 fixtures ) and they do it with lots of pride			0
@entity95 and @entity96 are among the stars likely to be rested but nevertheless @entity0 has repeated his call for referees to protect the @entity101 star , who he says he is being targeted by @entity4 defenders			2
‘ the first free kicks of every game is somebody kicking him , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ he has fouls and fouls and fouls			0
i do n’t see many yellow cards			0
sometimes the yellow cards are the consequence of violent conduct but i also think that the accumulation of small fouls is violent conduct			0
‘ and he is suffering the consequences of that but playing amazingly well and against @entity68 he was amazing even with the second half and a difficult result to face , to have the determination to keep believing to the end , he was fantastic			2
’ @entity0 was furious at the treatment he felt @entity95 was receiving during @entity8 's loss at @entity68			1

@entity8 host @entity11 in the @entity6 third round on sunday *afternoon*
match will be @entity8 's fifth in 15 days during a busy *festive* fixture list
*blues* suffered a 5 - 3 @entity4 loss at @entity68 on @entity2
