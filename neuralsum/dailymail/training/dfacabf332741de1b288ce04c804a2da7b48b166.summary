@entity0 was always facing a difficult balancing act between sticking with the austerity drive and giving the economy a boost humiliating ? certainly			1
having made so much of @entity7 ’s @entity6 credit rating as a magnificent statement of confidence in his economic policies , chancellor @entity0 has been given a political bloody nose by @entity14 ’s downgrade			1
polls indicate the @entity16 leading in the run - up to the @entity18 by - election but the new rating can serve to be only a setback as voters reconsider @entity0 ’s attempts to cut the deficit			1
the loss of our @entity6 credit rating had been widely expected and we would do better not to place much emphasis on minor tweaks by agencies – after all , they are still somewhat tarnished by their failings during the financial crash			2
@entity0 was always facing a balancing act in next month ’s budget between sticking to his austerity drive to retain our rating and giving the economy a boost to generate the growth that is needed if we are ever going to pay down our debts			1
while businessmen have stressed their desire for the chancellor to keep a tight rein , they have become increasingly frustrated that there have been no imaginative initiatives to kick - start growth			1
companies in this country have about £ 180 billion in cash on their books and have been looking to the chancellor to come up with a gesture to encourage them to start spending this money to create orders and jobs			2
the fact that the pound fell suggests most economists were taken by surprise by the timing of @entity14 ’s downgrade – most had thought such a move unlikely before the autumn			2
thinking in the @entity68 is mixed this weekend on whether the downgrade will put more than temporary pressure on sterling			2
however , if the pound falls more that could create an inflationary pressure that the @entity73 is unlikely to want to stave off with higher interests rates because of the damage that would inflict on the wider economy			2
the pound is already seven per cent down from the start of the year , which will make our imports more expensive			0
that will be uncomfortable for shoppers who are already experiencing a squeeze on the purchasing power of the pound in their pocket			0
the incoming @entity73 governor @entity85 has indicated he is prepared to tolerate inflation if that is the price for growth the @entity73 has already said that inflation will top three per cent during the summer but the betting must be on three per cent looking rather moderate longer term			1
incoming @entity73 governor @entity85 has already indicated he is prepared to tolerate a dose of inflation if that is the price necessary for growth			1
conversely , though , it would be good news for our exporters who have , recently , been showing themselves more inclined to pass on the benefits of the weaker pound in terms of lower prices for their overseas customers rather than keeping prices level and pocketing a larger profit			0
the @entity110 ’s own worst - case scenario is that we could have to pay an extra £ 20 billion a year in interest payments because of our slightly diminished credit ranking			0
however , @entity113 was actually able to borrow more cheaply after it was downgraded			1
and , do n’t forget , investors have to put their money somewhere			0
only @entity117 and @entity118 still have @entity6 - rated economies – and arguably even @entity117 could be under pressure			0
unlike us it does not control its own currency and therefore lacks the flexibility that manipulating the exchange rate can give			0
its recent economic performance has also been weak			0
@entity7 ’s economic ranking may have lost some of its lustre but it is in good company : ratings are not absolutes .			0
