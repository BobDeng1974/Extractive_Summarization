@entity0 is home to a bizarre creature , @entity2 , that ’s straight out of a sci - fi or horror film			1
the bizarre , hairy frog with cat - like extendable claws can break its own bones to produce talons that puncture their way out of the frog ’s toe pads			1
@entity14 and scientists at @entity17 's @entity16 , think the gruesome behaviour is a defence mechanism			0
party trick : hairy frogs from the @entity0 have revealed a remarkable mechanism that causes thorn - like claws to burst through the skin when it is threatened the researchers say there are salamanders that push their ribs through their skin to produce protective barbs on demand , but the mechanism on this frog has never been seen before			1
the feature is also found in nine of the 11 frogs belonging to the @entity39 genus , most of which live in @entity0			1
' some other frogs have bony spines that project from their wrist , but in those species it appears that the bones grow through the skin rather than pierce it when needed for defence , ' @entity14 told @entity49			1
the claws of @entity51 , which are found only on the hind feet , are nestled inside a mass of connective tissue			1
a chunk of collagen forms a bond between the claw 's sharp point and a small piece of bone at the tip of the frog 's toe			1
the other end of the claw is connected to a muscle			1
researchers believe that when the animal is under threat , it contracts this muscle , which pulls the claw downwards			1
the sharp point then breaks away from the bony tip and cuts through the toe pad , emerging on the underside			0
@entity78 problem : the foot of a living @entity2 frog , which is one of the 11 species of @entity84 frogs , shows the white bony claws protruding from the tips of the toes the mechanism is unique among vertebrates , as is the fact that the claw is just bone - without an outer coating of keratin as other claws do			1
but only studied dead specimens have been studies , so it is unknown what happens when the claw retracts - or even how it retracts			1
it does not appear to have a muscle to pull it back inside so it ’s thought that it may passively slide back into the toe pad when its muscle relaxes			2
' being amphibians , it would not be surprising if some parts of the wound heal and the tissue is regenerated , ' says @entity14			0
cutting edge : @entity110 , played by @entity111 , has retractable claws			2
he also has a healing factor that allows him to recover from virtually any wound , disease , or toxin at an accelerated rate males of the species , which grows to about 11 centimetres , also produce long hair - like strands of skin and arteries when they breed			2
the ‘ hairs ’ allow them to take in more oxygen through their skin while they take care of their brood			2
in @entity0 , they roasted and eaten			1
hunters use long spears and machetes to kill the frogs , apparently to avoid being hurt by their claws			2
‘ this is an incredible story , ’ says @entity138 , curator of herpetology at the @entity140 , @entity141			0
' some frogs grown spines on their thumbs during breeding season , but this is entirely different			0
‘ for me , it highlights the need for a lot more research on amphibians especially in light of the threat of mass extinctions , ’ he adds			0
the existence of frogs with erectile claws like cats was first described by @entity162 zoologist @entity161 in 1900 in frogs found in the @entity164 , now the @entity164			2
@entity165 , a herpetologist at the @entity166 , @entity167 , questions whether the bony protrusions are meant for fighting			0
they could allow a frog 's feet ' to get a better grip on whatever rocky habitat they might be in , ' he says the @entity177 people of @entity0 traditionally believed that the frogs fall from the sky and , when eaten , help childless human couples become fertile			1
the males have a paired internal vocal sac and three short ridges of small black spines along the inner surface of the first manual digit			0
breeding males also develop – somewhat hair - like – dermal papillae that extend along the flanks and thighs			0
these contain arteries and are thought to increase the surface for the purpose of absorbing oxygen ( comparably to external gills of the aquatic stage ) , which is useful as the male stays with his eggs for an extended period of time after they have been laid in the water by the female			0
the species is terrestrial , but returns to the water for breeding , where egg masses are laid onto rocks in streams			0
the quite muscular tadpoles are carnivorous and feature several rows of horned teeth			0
adults feed on slugs , myriapods , spiders , beetles and grasshoppers			0
amphibian researcher and biologist @entity221 of the @entity222 , says that this type of weaponry appears to be unique in the animal kingdom .			0

the @entity0 frog is unique as the claw is just bone without an outer coating of keratin , as other claws do
scientist say that the frog ’s flesh heals itself after the talons puncture the skin
a local tradition believes that when eaten , childless couples become fertile
