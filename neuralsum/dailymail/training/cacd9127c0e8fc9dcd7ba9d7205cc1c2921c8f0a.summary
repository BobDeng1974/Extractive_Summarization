@entity0 has written an open letter to @entity3 fans , claiming he never wanted to leave the @entity5 giants			1
the winger completed his £ 60million move to @entity8 on tuesday , signing a five - year deal with the @entity11 club			1
but he insists he would rather have signed a new contract with the @entity14 winners			1
‘ as anyone who works , i ’ve always wanted to progress			2
after winning ‘ @entity42 ’ i went to the @entity39 with the hope of receiving a new contract , which never came			1
‘ many things and many lies were spoken			2
they always wanted to attribute the initiative to me to leave the club , but i did not			1
the only thing i asked for is something that would be fair			2
world class : @entity24 has been a key figure for both @entity3 and @entity51 over the past few years ‘ there are many things that i value and many of them have nothing to do with my salary			1
i hope to progress at @entity8 , one of the biggest clubs in the world , where i wish to make history			1
’ @entity24 has signed a five - year deal with @entity8 , just three months after inspiring @entity3 to their 10th @entity14 triumph against city rivals @entity64 in @entity65			1
he added : ‘ i ’ve been lucky enough to share a dressing room with fantastic players , who have been even better companions			2
‘ i think that was the key to @entity42			2
i want to apologize for the times i was wrong , on or off the pitch			2
it was never my intention to harm anyone			2
‘ i sweated for this shirt in every game as if it was my last			0
there were times when things went for me and others not , but what i can say is that i always gave everything			0
’ like our dedicated @entity8 facebook page			1
creative : the winger should bring a new spark to @entity87 's side , which has been lacking this season @entity89 joins @entity92 's @entity91 exodus @entity93 , my cycle at @entity3 has come to an end			1
is impossible to capture all i have lived through in a few lines , but i want this letter to communicate what i feel at the moment of parting			1
in these four years i had the honor to wear this shirt i feel nothing but pride for what i went through and achieved along with my team mates			0
unfortunately today i have to go , but i want to make clear that this was never my desire			1
as anyone who works , i ’ve always wanted to progress			0
after winning “ @entity42 ” i went to the @entity39 with the hope of receiving a new contract , which never came			1
many things and many lies were spoken			0

i want to thank @entity5 for everything you gave me and especially for allowing my daughter to be born on this earth			0
and to the very special people at @entity151 hospital , which i will always carry in my heart			0
my wife , daughter and i will be forever grateful			0
also to my colleagues who gave me their support always , in good times and bad , to the various technical bodies that i got to work with and also to all the people who work every day at the club , with which i hope to keep a great relationship			2
i hope that @entity3 have a great season and get this club the achievements they are always looking for			1
i take forever in my memory that time in the @entity168 when i jumped at the @entity169 and i received from the fans immense affection			1
