points can be used to buy content from the respective stores			0
they can be bought using a credit card and the credit card can then be removed			2
this means parents can buy their children points to spend on games and upgrades , and control how much they spend without adding a credit card to the account			0
however , in october 2012 , @entity46 began support local currency in the @entity48 instead of relying on @entity25			0
this suggests that @entity50 may move away from its virtual currency , in the same way @entity53 did with its @entity55 scheme last year			0
the coins will also be able to be used on the company 's retail site when they become more widely available			2
@entity0 has not yet confirmed when the scheme will be launched outside of the @entity12 , or if it will be available to @entity61 users			1
@entity2 can be bought in batches of 1000 , 2500 , 5000 and 10,000			1
the more you buy , the bigger the discount and 10,000 coins costs $ 90 , for example			2
customers will also get a 10 % discount on items bought using @entity2			1
@entity0 is n't the first company to introduce it 's own currency ; @entity73 and @entity31 customers can use @entity25 to pay for games , upgrades , bonus levels and so on			0

@entity53 launched @entity55 in 2009 , which could be used for apps and games on the social network site , but scrapped the scheme last year in favour of local currency			0
@entity0 has said it has launched its @entity91 as a way for developers to make more money by making it easier for shoppers to buy apps and games			0
it hopes coins will make it easier for customers to pay for items because they can buy and store coins in their @entity10 accounts to use as and when			0
it can also be a way for parents to control how much children spend , negating the need to have a credit card attached to the account			0
@entity0 already accepts card payments and gift cards for @entity5 purchases and has said that these payment options will remain			0
@entity0 developers had until april 25 to submit their app if they wanted it to run on the new @entity13 currency			0
