a fox and a hedgehog have become the most unlikely of friends after they were caught enjoying a fine dining experience together			1
the animals were captured eating food on webcams set up by wildlife enthusiast @entity7 , at his home in @entity10 , @entity11			1
mr @entity7 said he expected the fox to see the hedgehog as prey but was surprised to see them feed side by side			1
do you come here often ? a wildlife enthusiast was stunned when he put up a secret camera in his garden - and caught a hedgehog sharing a meal with a fox he said			2
' i think there have been several of each using the feeding stations			0
they seem to tolerate each other			0
' mr @entity7 , 43 , says he has 30 webcams set up in his garden 's feeding stations , which he uses to monitor nest boxes and his nightly visitors			0
he says the hedgehogs feed about 10 times a night and are joined by the fox between 1am and 3am in the morning - most likely after a night on the tiles			1
he also has another hedgehog , whose behaviour has changed recently as it builds a nest - signalling that it might be a pregnant female			0
yummy : the fox seems focused on devouring its meal - thankfully it is not the hedgehog fine dining : have you heard the one about the fox and the hedgehog who dine out early in the morning ? wildlife experts suggest that foxes do not generally pose a threat to hedgehogs but there are rare incidents where foxes can prey on the spiky hedgehog			1
some foxes will wait for a hedgehog to unroll from its defensive ball , before taking a bite at it			2
but this chummy pair appear to be more interested in feasting at the @entity68 giving mr @entity7 delightful footage			2
the wildlife enthusiast reveals that he starts his day by sitting with a cuppa and taking a long look back at the footage from the night before			0
finished : the fox appears to take a crafty look in front of it - is it looking for dessert ?			0

the unlikely duo dine out in @entity11 between 1am and 3am every morning
both appear to enjoy a tasty *treat* at the ' @entity68 '
the fox does not see the hedgehog as prey and eats *alongside* it
wildlife experts suggest foxes do not generally pose a threat to hedgehogs
