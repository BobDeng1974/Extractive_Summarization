by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:19 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 18:13 est , 7 may 2013 she was seven years old and playing with a teddy at her side			0
every now and again she would give it a hug or swing it by the ears as she spoke			0
the teddy was a white bear called @entity10			0
the little girl was a crucial witness in the @entity13 murder trial			1
yesterday , in juvenile , matter - of - fact tones , she described what she saw at the moment the prosecution say april was abducted and driven off to her death			1
hearing : a film of april @entity22 's best friend describing to police when the schoolgirl disappeared was played to @entity25 heartbroken : april @entity22 's parents @entity27 ( pictured today ) were in court to hear evidence from their daughter 's best friend , who said april happily got into a @entity32 - the last time she was seen the two best friends were playing in the street when she noticed a man standing by a @entity32 or van			1
that , she said , was ' how april got missing '			2
in her distinct @entity41 accent she added : ' the man did n't take her in the van – she got into the van , having a happy face , she had			1
' she was n't upset			2
she did n't say she was going to go in it			0
she was n't crying – she was happy			2
i do n't know why she wanted to go because her mum and dad told her not to get into cars ... ' the seven - year - old 's testimony was originally given to police the day after five - year - old april disappeared in october last year			1
it was filmed and played to the trial at @entity25 yesterday			0
then she gave evidence by live video link from an undisclosed location 80 miles away in @entity59			0
she offered @entity10 a drink from a plastic bottle , put her chin in her hands , and waited for questions from the court			2
suspect : @entity13 arrives in court ( left ) , and the jury heard more evidence claiming it was him ( right ) who abducted and murdered april last october evidence : april 's seven - year - old friend was later questioned by video link , and was asked to draw the vehicle and person she believed took her friend in different circumstances , she might have been any schoolgirl suddenly asked to describe to a teacher what she did over the weekend			1
she laughed , fidgeted , played with her hair and munched on a packet of crisps			0
but the testimony she gave to a court yesterday marked a key stage in the trial – and dramatically contradicted the account given by april 's killer			1
former slaughterman @entity13 claims he accidentally ran april over , drove off with her dead or dying in his @entity32 , then panicked and lost all recollection of what he did with her			1
yesterday , out of sight of the seven - year - old , he fixed the court video screen with a gaze and muttered to himself in the dock			2
not once did the jury of nine women and three men hear the child witness say she had seen her best friend run over			1
in her recorded interview , the girl sat on a sofa with a toy bunny called mr @entity108 on her lap. she was asked by a policewoman what happened			2
' we were just playing until the man came , ' she said			0
' we were going to go home because it was a little bit dark			1
i said , “ april come on ! ” ' upsetting : april @entity22 was shown on @entity117 inside her local leisure centre after going swimming			2
the time shows almost 5.30pm and within two hours she had disappeared when she turned round , however , she saw april with the man			2
she explained she recognised the vehicle because she had seen two friends in it before			0
the children she named were the children of @entity13 , the jury has heard			1
april 's parents would never have let her get into the van with anyone , she said			1
but she saw the man talking to april then watched her get in			0
' she got in through the driver 's way , ' she said			1
' the two back doors were locked			0
april tried to open them , she did , and it would n't work			0
she climbed over and climbed into the back seat			0
then the @entity32 drove off			1
' sketch : murder suspect @entity13 lowers his head in the dock , where he is using headphones to help him follow proceedings a few minutes later april 's brother came running towards her and said it was time for april to go home			1
' then i said what happened			0
i gave april 's bike to him , and got my bike , and he went back and told his mum			1
my mum called the police , she did			0
' the witness , who can not be named because of her age , asked police at one stage : ' can i go and see my mum ? ' after a break she returned to draw the vehicle , adding a ' stick man ' to show where the person she saw was standing			1
she wrote ' @entity32 ' on the vehicle she had drawn			2
footage : a camera at the local @entity171 garage spotted @entity173 's car , which may have contained april at the time and may have been seen by april 's best friend , the court has heard @entity177 : police launched @entity180 's biggest ever search after april @entity22 disappeared , but she has never been found trial : the seven - year - old appeared at @entity25 ( pictured ) via video link , alongside her favourite toys lounge : this is @entity13 's living room , where forensics found blood and bone fragments , a room which was shown to jurors visit : jurors arrive by coach at the home of @entity13 , @entity195 in @entity196 , @entity197 , on the third day of his trial for the abduction and murder of @entity13			1
it is surrounded by trees , outbuildings and a river runs down its left side from time to time the girl appeared live on screen to be asked if she wanted a break from watching her recorded evidence			0
she wore a pink cardigan and a white headband in her long dark hair , and sounded considerably more grown up than she did in her interview , despite the fact that only seven months had passed			0
the judge , mr justice @entity217 , introduced himself with a wave and explained he was not wearing a wig in case she did not like it			0
the 68 - year - old former @entity222 lieutenant sported a plain grey suit but kept his judicial collar so that she could identify him			0
next it was time for her to speak to the barrister who introduced himself as ' the one in the orange tie ' – @entity230 , defending @entity173			0
the court has been told @entity173 claims the seven - year - old 's account is a ' fabrication ' and ' utterly untrue '			1
in cross examination , she was asked if she saw april ' off her bike and lying on the floor very near to where the @entity32 was '			1
' she was talking but she was standing up when she was talking to the man			0
' the girl said she did not see him bending down and did not see april on the floor , adding : ' the man did n't carry her into the front seat			2
' @entity173 , 47 , denies abduction , murder and perverting the course of justice			1
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

the girl , who can not be named , then said she saw april ' get in a @entity32 '
' she got in the van , having a happy face . she was *n’t* upset , ' she said
