a real life @entity1 has uncovered details about @entity4 's riches in a newly translated @entity6 text			1
but treasure hunters may have to wait a bit longer as , unlike the film ‘ @entity13 , ’ details about the exact location of these treasures are unclear			1
rather than a guide to lost treasure , the newly translated ‘ treatise of the @entity17 ’ was a legendary story written in @entity20 times that was meant to entertain			1
the @entity21 is a gilded case believed to have been constructed nearly 3,000 years ago the @entity21 the @entity24 - according to the @entity25 , this was a portable dwelling where @entity26 chose to meet his people musical instruments made of gold ornaments from the @entity31 77 golden tables of the bread of the presence - bread placed on a special table as an offering to @entity26 silver trumpets the clothing of the high priest thousands of garments of regular priests gems from the ' @entity43 ' , or @entity44 the text , translated by professor @entity46 from @entity47 , suggests the artefacts from @entity4 's temple were tucked away in various places throughout the @entity51			1
it lists a number of treasures including the @entity21 , the @entity24 , musical instruments made of gold , ornaments from the @entity31 and various precious religious stones			1
it describes : ' 77 tables of gold , and their gold was from the walls of the @entity31 that was revealed to @entity4 , and they radiate like the radiance of the sun and moon , which radiate the height of the world			1
' ' the number of stones was forty - six thousands and the number of pearls was the same ... seven curtains of fold in which was collected twelve thousands talents of gold and the vestments of the @entity79 and their belts			1
' the @entity6 text claiming to reveal the location of @entity83 hidden treasure and the fate of the @entity21			1
the oldest confirmed example of the treatise , which survives to present day , is from a book published in @entity89 in 1648 called ' @entity90 ' a modern - day @entity1 has uncovered details about the fate of the @entity21 ( pictured in this stone carving ) in a newly translated @entity6 text the @entity21 is a legendary gilded case believed to have been constructed nearly 3,000 years ago			1
according to biblical text , the @entity21 holds the @entity98 handed down to @entity99 by @entity26			2
it was housed in @entity100 , which contained a variety of different treasures			2
in the @entity103 , the @entity21 is a box made from a of wood generally translated as acacia , covered in gold			1
the top surface of the @entity21 is decorated with two cherubim , or angels , who crouch facing each other with wings outstretched , forming a seat			0
some say @entity26 himself occupies that seat , while the @entity21 served as a footstool			0
when @entity4 ’s @entity119 was captured and destroyed by the @entity120 in 597 and 586 @entity121 , the coveted artefact disappeared @entity122 of the treasures were hidden in @entity124 and @entity120 , while others were delivered into the hands of the angels @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130			1
‘ the text tells us no more about where the @entity21 and other treasures might be than if you watched the film , ’ professor @entity46 told @entity136			1
‘ but it does provide some interesting insights into @entity142 legends in the @entity143 …			0
mostly it tells us ways in which people understood the @entity25 that are not part of official interpretation			0

but when @entity4 ’s @entity119 was captured and destroyed by the @entity120 in 597 and 586 @entity121 , the coveted artefact disappeared forever			0
archaeologists are still unsure whether @entity21 was captured , destroyed or hidden , and many have searched for it throughout the centuries			2
the text , which dates back at least as far back as the 15th century , says the ‘ treasures were concealed by a number of @entity79 and prophets			1
’ ‘ some of these ( treasures ) were hidden in various locations in the @entity163 and in @entity120 , while others were delivered into the hands of the angels @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and perhaps @entity167 , ’ he writes			1
the writer of the text draws on traditional methods of scriptural explanation to explain where the treasures might have been hidden			1
but there are a number of inconsistencies in the text			2
for example , in the prologue it states that @entity180 and his companions hid the treasures			0
later on the text mentions the treasures being in the keeping of , or hidden by , @entity128 and other angels			1
‘ i believe the author looked at various legends without much concern about making them consistent , ’ said professor @entity46			0
he added that the treatise is similar in some ways to the metallic ‘ @entity197 , ’ one of the @entity194 found near the site of @entity199 in the @entity200			1
@entity4 @entity4 has fascinated historians , scholars and treasure hunters for centuries			0
some have been drawn to his poetry , others to his tales of wisdom - and many to the tales of his phenomenal wealth			0
although the only accounts of him come from the @entity25 , many historians believe he was a real and immensely powerful figure			0
the son of @entity217 - of the @entity219 story - and @entity221 @entity220 , he was the third king of @entity124 and ruled for 40 years , between @entity222 and @entity223			0
during his reign , @entity124 was at the heart of a prosperous and stable empire			0
he rebuilt @entity227 , creating magnificent palaces and fortresses , and also built the first temple to store the @entity21			0
the @entity232 reveals he had 700 wives , including the daughter of a pharoah and 300 concubines			0
the @entity237 also reveals how he was visited by the @entity221 , who was so impressed by his wealth that she arrived on camel with spices , gifts and tons of gold			0
according to @entity25 , he was a prolific writer , composing 1,005 songs and 3,000 proverbs			0
many are still in use , with the expression ' pride comes before a fall ' based on one of his sayings			0

the treatise says that the treasures from @entity4 's @entity119 were recorded ‘ on a tablet of bronze , ’ a metal like the @entity197			1
the copper scroll also discusses the location of hidden treasure , although not from @entity100			1
professor @entity46 said this might reveal a tradition of inscribing lists of treasures on metal			0
the oldest confirmed example of the treatise , which survives to present day , is from a book published in @entity89 in 1648 called ‘ @entity90			0
’ however , professor @entity46 is the first to translate the text into @entity279 .			2

' treatise of the @entity17 ’ suggests artefacts were hidden in the @entity51
