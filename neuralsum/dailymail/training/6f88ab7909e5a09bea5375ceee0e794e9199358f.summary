by @entity0 published : 11:46 est , 5 december 2013 updated : 14:09 est , 5 december 2013 most of us are familiar with the @entity4 effect and the rush to the shops that ensues after the @entity4 is spotted out and about in a chic ensemble			0
but it seems that the @entity10 has an equally impressive an effect on sales after @entity13 , the leather goods company that makes @entity16 's trademark boxy bags , revealed that purchases have doubled over the last year			1
sales of the Â£ 1,095 bags increased by 52 per cent with the monarch cited as the driving force behind the surge			1
fit for a queen : @entity24 , the company behind the monarch 's bags , recorded a 52 per cent rise in sales last year favourite : the queen during an engagement in @entity32 and leaving the @entity33 with her @entity13 bag although the @entity10 usually plumps for simple black patent , the last year has seen her step out clutching bags in a rainbow of different hues and a variety of sizes			1
while the @entity10 usually carries the traviata style , @entity13 say that the smaller newly - launched @entity44 style is also set to do well , as are metallic versions of the monarch 's trademark bag			2
' @entity13 continues to embrace more colour and design - led collections more than ever before , sales in colourful handbags have exploded both domestically and internationally this year , ' added @entity52 , ceo of @entity13			1
while royal fashion fans can , for a consideration , get their hands on similar bags to those toted by the @entity10 , getting hold of pieces from the rest of her wardrobe is more of a challenge			2
trademark : the monarch usually plumps for a black patent style although has been seen with other colours the majority of the @entity10 's clothes are bespoke , with many designed and made by dresser @entity69			0
although @entity69 is behind much of the royal wardrobe , the @entity10 is also fond of couturier @entity72 who creates pieces to order from his @entity75 atelier			0
hats , meanwhile , also come courtesy of @entity69 , while the @entity10 's trademark jewels tend to be family heirlooms .			0
