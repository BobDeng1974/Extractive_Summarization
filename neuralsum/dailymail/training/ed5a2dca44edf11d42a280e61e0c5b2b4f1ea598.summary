by @entity0 one in six families have mortgages which are more than four times bigger than their salaries , the @entity1 reveals today			1
the report highlights the huge gulf in @entity7 because half of families have no mortgage or only a small loan of less than twice their salary , but 16 per cent have ‘ a debt to income ratio above four			1
’ if a worker earns the average full - time salary of £ 27,000 , this means his or her mortgage is more than £ 108,000 or , if a couple earn a total of £ 50,000 , their mortgage is more than £ 200,000			0
report : one in six families have mortgages which are more than four times bigger than their salaries of those struggling with their mortgage , many are also in negative equity , which means the size of their loan is bigger than the value of their property			1
the @entity1 ’s quarterly bulletin , published today , reveals one in 25 families are currently in this precarious position , a disaster if they want or urgently need to sell their home			1
the number of negative equity victims has risen sharply since 2007 , the year that the credit crunch struck , when just one per cent were affected to four per cent of households today			1
to add to the pressure on families , their other debts are also rising			2
for those who have unsecured debts , such as personal loans , the average amount has jumped by nearly £ 1,000 over the last year from £ 5,400 to £ 6,300 this year			0
when asked how they feel about their debts , nearly two - thirds of families with large mortgages relative to the value of their homes said they are ‘ somewhat or very concerned			2
’ this only applies to people whose mortgage represents 75 per cent or more of the current value of their property			2
it comes at a time that the @entity1 has kept the base rate at 0.5 per cent , the lowest level in its 319 - year history , raising fears of how families will cope when interest rates rise			1
asked how they would cope if the interest rate on their mortgage rose by 2.5 percentage points but did not get a payrise , one in two families said they would have to ‘ cut spending or work longer hours ’			2
yesterday the @entity78 said mortgage lending jumped to its highest monthly total last month for six years			0
in november , around £ 17billion was handed out in mortgages , which is 30 per cent higher than the same month last year and the highest monthly total amount since november 2007			2
homes : the number of negative equity victims has risen sharply since 2007 , the year the credit crunch struck @entity88 , the @entity78 ’s chief economist , said mortgage lending is still ‘ a far cry ’ from the pre-credit crunch days because banks and building societies have become so much more ‘ risk - averse			1
’ the pressure on people to buy a home is immense with wages stalling or falling for the last five years , but house prices continuing to rise			0
young people are having to take out the largest - ever loans - £ 119,500 - and earn the highest - ever salaries - £ 36,460 , either on their own or a joint income with a partner - in order to get onto the property ladder , according to the @entity78			0
to add to this pressure , house prices are predicted to keep on rising , with little or no chance of pay rising at the same pace			0
the @entity111 predicts house price will rise by eight per cent in 2014 , although there will be significant regional variations			0
in @entity116 , prices will rise by 11 per cent , the fastest of the @entity7 regions , compared to only four per cent in @entity118 , the smallest rise			1
@entity120 , global residential director of @entity111 , said : ‘ while the number of new homes being built is now on the rise , it still wo n’t be anywhere near enough to meet demand			0
‘ we expect the problem of insufficient housing stock to be the main driver behind price increases over the next twelve months			0
