@entity0 dressed to impress as she attended @entity2 's @entity1 show today			1
the prime minister 's wife took her seat on the front row wearing a pretty red sleeveless dress			1
but as she watched the models strut down the catwalk showcasing the spring / summer collection from @entity11 , she may have realised that her footwear was n't quite on trend			1
the models including @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 all wore their glamorous dresses with trainers or pumps			0
also on the front row for the show at @entity36 was model @entity38 - who had got the style memo about casual footwear			1
she wore a revealing navy suit by @entity2 with colourful chunky trainers			0
footwear fail : the prime minister 's wife looked stylish in a red dress - but was n't on trend by wearing sandals with a heel would n't miss this show : @entity0 , who is as an ambassador for the @entity52 , has long been a fan of @entity2 designs but @entity0 could rest assured that she was n't the only fashionistas not in on the flat shoe trend			2
@entity56 also wore heeled sandals as she arrived with @entity38 and watched the stellar show from the front row			2
the lucky viewers with coveted tickets to the @entity1 must - see event were treated to a sumptuous selection of layered tulle dresses , cropped denim jackets and classic trenches inspired by the birds and the bees			0
not a heel in sight : the @entity2 models took to the catwalk in flats and trainers @entity75 : the spring / summer 15 collection from @entity11 was inspired by nature insects of @entity79 was @entity11 's point of reference and he translated this onto the catwalk via butterfly printed satin skirts , bags emblazoned with hand - drawn honey bees and his iconic trench reworked for @entity89 in every colour in the rainbox from dragonfly blue to beetle green			1
@entity29 showed us how to do organza for spring as she and the other @entity2 girls stomped the catwalk in the most beautiful layered tulle dresses in poppy rosehip , which were sometimes teamed with lilac suede cropped jackets			2
not the only one : while @entity38 was of course on trend in trainers , @entity56 also wore heels like @entity104 waists were nipped with cobweb tulle belts , creating a waspish silhouette adhering to the theme of the show			0
@entity0 , who is as an ambassador for the @entity52 , has long been a fan of @entity2 designs			0
for the 2012 royal wedding of the @entity113 and @entity114 , she chose to wear a vibrant green dress from the @entity79 fashion house which she later auctioned for charity .			0
