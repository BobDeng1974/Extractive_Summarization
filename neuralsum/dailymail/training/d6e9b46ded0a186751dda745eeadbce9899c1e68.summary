for ten years @entity0 has n't missed a single day of work			1
what 's even more remarkable is that @entity0 walks a round trip of 21 miles a day just to get there			1
for five days a week , @entity0 , 56 , trudges from his home in @entity6 to his job at the factory where he works in @entity9 , @entity10			1
he 's walked the walk ever since his 1988 @entity12 quit on him more than 10 years ago			0
his job pays him $ 10.55 an hour , which he claims is not enough for him to buy his own car , but that may well change after well - wishers managed to raise almost $ 42,000 for him in an online campaign in just hours			1
for now though , whatever the weather , @entity0 is there , on the job for his 2 - 10pm shift			1
' i set our attendance standard by this man , ' said his boss @entity43 to the @entity44			0
@entity43 is plant manager at high - end plastic moulding specialists , @entity46			1
' i say , if this man can get here , walking all those miles through snow and rain , well , i 'll tell you , i have people in @entity54 10 minutes away and they say they ca n't get here â€” bull ! he 's never missed			1
i 've seen him come in here wringing wet , ' said @entity43 , 53			0
to watch video in full click here @entity0 claims he powers his marathon - like commutes by drinking two liters of @entity64 and countless cans of @entity66 each day			1
' i sleep a lot on the weekend , yes i do , ' he said , ' but i ca n't imagine not working , ' although the commute getting into work is grueling , things are worse on the way back as @entity0 has to walk the streets alone , in the dark and freezing cold			1
none of his co-workers lives anywhere near him , so catching a ride almost never happens			2
faith : ' i 'm not saying i 'm a member of some church			0
but just before i get home , every night , i say , ' lord , keep me safe '' , mr @entity0 says his colleagues have been telling him for years to get a car but it appears that @entity0 has fallen into a routine that he almost seems to enjoy it			1
' i keep a rhythm in my head , ' he says			0
' i 'm not saying i 'm a member of some church			0
but just before i get home , every night , i say , ' lord , keep me safe			0
' about three - quarters of the way home , he has to catch the very last bus of the night at 1am into downtown @entity6 - after that it 's another five mile trek back to the home he shares with his girlfriend			1
the walk takes him through some shady neighborhoods including @entity100 and the infamous 8 mile area			0
@entity0 says he was mugged once but does n't like to talk about the incident			1
four hours later he is back home to catch some shut - eye before the long - distance commute begins all over again the following afternoon			2
' the last five years been really tough because the buses cut back , ' @entity0 said			1
once he gets to @entity107 and @entity6 , @entity0 can take a bus but the schedule is so infrequent the area is really best designed for those that have access to a car			1
he says that it 's not just the $ 1,700 monthly paycheck that lures him back to work each day but the very essence of being around his friendly co-workers whom he calls ' family '			2
the boss 's wife has also taken a shine to him and prepares him home - cooked meals each evening too			2
grueling : after repeated cutbacks in bus service the walking segments of his daily commute now takes more time than he spends in his eight - hour factory shift			1
for @entity0 it 's a chance to catch - up on some sleep on several occasions , a banker driving the exact same route has given @entity0 a ride			1
@entity135 , 47 , of @entity9 said he saw @entity136 over and over in various weathers and wondered what he was doing out all alone			0
whenever he sees him along the route , he gives him a ride and very occasionally , even if it 's after midnight , he will go out driving along his route to see if he can offer him a lift			2
' knowing what i know , i ca n't drive past him now			1
i 'm in my car with the heat blasting and even then my feet are cold , ' @entity135 said			0
of course , all that may now be about to change after tens of thousands of dollars were raised for him in an online campaign			0
@entity0 said sunday he was flattered by the attention he 'd gotten for his tenacious treks after the he made front page news in a local newspaper			2
he said he was amazed that complete strangers would respond so generously with some even offering to buy him a brand new car			0
@entity159 , 19 , of @entity160 , a @entity161 student studying computer science , said he was struck by the article and the sheer numbers of people commenting online , many of them asking how they could help @entity0			2
@entity159 said he decided to act			0
' i just used my phone			0
i created the go - funding site and within an hour we had $ 2,000 , ' he said			2
a local car dealership even offered to give him a 2014 @entity172 or @entity173			0
' he gets to choose , ' said @entity174 , customer service specialist at @entity176 in @entity177			0
' we were just impressed with his determination , ' ms. @entity174 said			0
as of monday morning , the total was close to $ 42,000 and still rising .			0
