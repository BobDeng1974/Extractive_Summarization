algae - like structures found inside fragments of a meteorite which struck @entity4 last year prove that life exists elsewhere in the @entity6 , a new study claims			1
a paper by an international team of scientists , their second on the subject , makes the extraordinary claim that electron microscope images of the rocks have revealed tiny fossilised life forms from outer space			1
the authors are convinced that their findings offer firm evidence of panspermia , the hypothesis that life exists throughout the @entity6 and is spread by meteoroids , asteroids and planetoids			2
from outer space ? this electron microscope image of a meteor fragment shows a microfossil of extraterrestrial origin , a study claims the microorganism that fell to @entity34 : this picture shows a close up of the point marked ( b ) in the image above : the paper claims that the rock in which these were found came from a meteor which landed in @entity4 undeniably organic ? the paper reiterates claims first made in january in an earlier study led by controversial scientist @entity45 however , sceptics are already lining up to pour scorn on their methodology			1
@entity49 first reported in january the claims by professor @entity45 , of the @entity51 , that investigations of the meteorite had revealed evidence of alien life			1
he is joint author of a new study , just published in the @entity58 , which reiterates the controversial claims on the basis of a new analysis of the rocks			1
the paper tells how on the evening of december 29 last year a bright yellow fireball lit up the skies over @entity66 , @entity4 , turning green as it disintegrated on entry into the @entity34 's atmosphere			1
blazing hot , sparkling fragments rained down on the villages and paddy fields below , according to reports , leaving some witnesses with burns and giving off fumes with a strong odour of asphalt			1
local police collected samples of the curious rocks and handed them to the @entity82 of the @entity4 @entity83 , who then passed them on to researchers at @entity87 for further analysis , the study says			1
in total @entity89 , of @entity87 's @entity90 , and colleagues received 628 fragments purportedly from the meteorite - three of which , they say , were ' clearly identified as possible meteorites '			1
in the latest study , the researchers make the extraordinary claim than these three rocks contain fossilised biological structures fused into the rock matrix			2
furthermore , they say , their tests have ruled out the possibility of terrestrial contamination			1
the team published electron microscope images of structures within the stones which they say show a complex , thick - walled , carbon - rich microfossil about 100 micrometres across			2
another image , they say , shows well - preserved flagella 100 micrometres long but only two micrometres in diameter			2
claims : professor @entity45 with the fragment of space rock in which the fossils were found evidence for @entity119 ? critics say that even if the rock was indeed from outer space , research into it has failed to prove that the traces of life apparently found are not the result of contamination here on @entity34 the researchers interpret that unusual long and thin configuration ' as indicating a low - gravity , low - pressure environment and rapid freeze - drying ' - which could only happen in outer space			1
a previous study , led by @entity137 and published in the @entity58 in january , also claimed to have found ' microscopic fossilized diatoms ( a basic form of algae ) ' in the samples			2
' we got it from the medical research institute in @entity4 , ' professor @entity45 told @entity49			1
' they got hold of it on the 29th december , when a fireball was seen in the area			2
' thousands of people spotted it , and minutes after there was a meteorite fall over a rice field			2
' farmers who rushed to pick up these stones had their hands burnt , and women fainted , so local medical staff and police were summoned to cordon off the area to collect the stones			0
' one of these was sent to us by colleagues			0
' however , the professor admitted at the time they the paper was a rush job and he and his colleagues did not have time to conduct the necessarily analyses to confirm it was a meteorite			1
to make up for that omission , in the latest study @entity89 and his colleagues also measured the chemical make up of the samples to determine their origin , claiming that low levels of nitrogen rule our the possibility of contamination by modern organisms			0
the researchers say their findings offer ' clear and convincing evidence that these obviously ancient remains of extinct marine algae found embedded in the @entity66 meteorite are indigenous to the stones and not the result of post-arrival microbial contaminants			2
' they add : ' the presence of fossilized biological structures provides compelling evidence in support of the theory of cometary panspermia first proposed over thirty years ago			0
' the study backs up the claims of professor @entity45 's widely rubbished january paper which claimed to have found evidence of alien life in the same rocks			1
smoking gun ? this scanning electron microscope image purports to show the tell - tale sign of a microscopic fossil a mathematician by training , professor @entity45 , 74 , claims microbes from outer space arrived on our planet from comets which then ' multiplied and seeded ' to form our life 3.8billion years ago			1
@entity45 is notorious as the only scientist to argue against evolution during the 1981 @entity223 legal case against the teaching of creationism in schools			0
the 74 - year - old @entity4 - born @entity228 mathematician obtained a phd from @entity230 under the supervision of the late sir @entity232			1
the pair went on to collaborate on a body of work some credit with providing the basis of the field of astrobiology			0
their joint work on the infrared spectra of interstellar grains led to developing the hypothesis of panspermia , which proposes that cosmic dust in space and comets is partly organic - and may have ' seeded ' life on @entity34			1
they further contended that extraterrestrial life forms continue to enter the @entity34 's atmosphere , and may be responsible for epidemic outbreaks , new diseases , and the genetic novelty necessary for macroevolution			0
in 2003 he was joint signatory on a letter sent to @entity259 which suggested that the virus which causes @entity261 may not come from chickens , but could in fact be from outer space			1
he was head of @entity87 's @entity51 until two years ago , when funding was withdrawn and he was dismissed from his post			0
he also believes that pathogens like the sars virus arrived here from deep space			0
' we are all aliens - we share a cosmic ancestry , ' he said at the time of the original study 's publication			0
' each time a new planetary system forms a few surviving microbes find their way into comets			0
' these then multiply and seed other planets			0
' these latest finds are just more evidence to point to the overwhelming fact that life on @entity34 began on other worlds			0
' professor @entity45 was head of @entity87 's @entity51 until two years ago when funding for the department was withdrawn and he was dismissed from his post			0
the controversial professor , the only scientist to testify against evolution in the famous 1981 creationist trial in @entity223 , has since carried on the project as a private company and charity			0
critics have already lined up to rubbish the latest study 's claims and to suggest that the methodology of the researchers was also flawed			1
@entity302 , author of @entity305 's @entity304 blog , said : ' i read the paper , and really it ’s more of the same as from the first paper			0
' in some ways , it ’s even shakier ; they provide lots of technical data that gives their work a veneer of credibility , but when you look a bit deeper you find they did n’t do a lot of critically necessary tests to establish the veracity of their claims			0
' controversial : professor @entity45 , left , says the still - smoking rocks were found after they fell in @entity4 , right , after a dramatic meteor shower @entity302 claims the tests undertaken by @entity89 and his colleagues did not go far enough to confirm that the rock samples they analysed were in fact from the meteor that appeared over @entity4 in december , and , even if they were from space , the analysis was insufficient to eliminate the possibility of contamination here on @entity34			1
professor @entity45 is a leading proponent of panspermia , the hypothesis that life exists throughout the @entity6 and is spread by meteoroids , asteroids and planetoids			0
@entity345 proposes that life forms that can survive the effects of space , such as extremophiles , become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life			2
these life - forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with protoplanetary disks			2
if met with ideal conditions on a new planet 's surfaces , the bacteria become active and the process of evolution begins , it is believed			0
he points out that another meteorite fell to @entity34 in the same area in 2004 and any samples picked up could have in fact been from this event - long enough ago for the rocks to have become thoroughly contaminated			2
and he adds that nowhere in the latest paper do the researchers indicate that they have undertaken the usual precautions to minimise findings which may have been caused by contamination			1
' so , they find some rocks , they claim ( without enough evidence ) that they 're meteorites , and they claim ( without evidence ) they 're from a recent meteorite fall , ' says @entity302			0
' they find diatoms , and they claim ( without controlling for contamination ) that not only these diatoms came from space , but that meteorites like this seeded @entity34 with life			1
' which is more likely : that , or that they found a rock from @entity34 that already had diatoms in it ? ' when professor @entity45 's january paper was published , @entity397 , professor of @entity398 at the @entity400 ’s @entity399 , told @entity49 she found the whole thing ‘ laughable ’			2
‘ there are serious inconsistencies with the data presented in the paper , ' she said			0
‘ the most important is that the rock they have found is yet to be proven to be a meteorite			0
‘ until that is done , no credence can be placed on the findings presented , especially when they are published in a non-mainstream journal			0

new paper reiterates claims made in january that meteorite contains traces of life from outer space
it reportedly landed in @entity4 in december after burning green in the *sky* , leaving *bystanders* with burns
critics rubbish claims , saying that the researchers methodology is ' even *flakier* ' than in first paper - and they have not ruled out contamination
