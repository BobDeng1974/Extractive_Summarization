@entity0 has spoken of the huge significance of @entity4 ’s @entity3 win to the long - term future of her @entity7 stable			1
but she has not been told whether she will still be training @entity9 ’s younger brother next year or if any relative of the legendary unbeaten horse will be stabled at @entity12 in 2015			1
@entity9 , as well as his four siblings , have all raced for @entity0 or her late husband sir @entity14			1
@entity0 congratulates @entity4 ridden by @entity15 after winning the @entity16 half - sister @entity17 , a dual winner at @entity20 level , will return to owner @entity22 ’s stud this week after her racing career ended with a sixth place in the @entity25 at @entity7 on friday			1
@entity22 , the owner of around half the 50 horses in @entity0 ’s care , has a yearling full - brother by @entity30 to both @entity9 and @entity4 to go into training in 2015			1
his racing manager , @entity32 , said the link between his boss and @entity12 remained strong but that no decision had been made about whether @entity4 would be retired or if the latest in the family line would follow in their hoofprints to @entity12			2
grimthorpe , who said @entity22 had around 20 foals from @entity9 ’s first crop to put into training , added : ‘ no decision has been made about where any of our yearlings will be trained has been made and wo n’t be for some time			0
the prince is still thinking what to do with @entity4			2
’ the organisers of @entity49 might have thought they had used up all their luck having the best horse in a generation in @entity9 to run at their meeting in its first two years , not only winning the @entity54 in 2011 and the @entity16 in 2012 but adding priceless impetus to its launch			1
but they were clearly wrong as his brother produced the perfect climax to saturday ’s season - ending finale			2
for @entity0 , it was not only hugely emotional to be standing in the same place as her husband two years earlier after winning @entity65 ’s most valuable race , but also a galloping prime time advertisement for the stable which now carries her name			1
@entity4 ( left ) beats @entity70 ( right ) to win the @entity71 at @entity72 @entity0 said : ‘ it is hugely important for people to see we can do it			1
it is wonderful to have owners like prince @entity79 and the @entity80 but it is always good to attract new people			0
‘ it would be lovely some looked at @entity85 on saturday and think they are doing a good job why do n’t we give them a try			0
‘ we thought @entity4 was in great shape but you just do n’t dare to dream it			2
being @entity9 ’s brother , to win the race he went out on , you could n’t make it up			0
’ it was a third @entity97 win of the season for @entity4 , who had previously won the @entity100 and @entity103 de @entity101			1
he has been a standard bearer for @entity105 in her first full season at the helm , his form and reputation transformed by the front - running tactics so efficiently carried out by jockey @entity15 , who is unlikely to appeal against the seven - day ban and £ 10,000 fine for using his whip above the permitted level			0
it will cost him mounts at the @entity117 and in the @entity118			0
the jockey said : ‘ the rules are there and you have to take the consequences			0
hopefully the suspension and the fine wo n't overshadow what happened			0
i do n't what such a great race marred by people saying he got a ban and a fine			0
’ @entity15 ’s wish will probably come true			0
@entity15 takes the acclaim of the crowd after winning on board @entity4			2

@entity4 won the @entity16 at @entity72
but the horse may not remain with @entity0 **'s** stable next year
it was @entity4 **'s** third @entity97 win of the season
