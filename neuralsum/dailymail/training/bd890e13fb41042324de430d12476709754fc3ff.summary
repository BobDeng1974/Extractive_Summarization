it just sat there staring at me			0
’ but while the round robin may look like he has swallowed a bauble or a few mince pies , experts said his size was probably not due to over-eating			0
@entity45 of the @entity46 said : ‘ they eat more in the winter as they need more energy to survive the cold			0
eating more creates a fat store but it does n’t usually make difference to their weight as they burn it off quickly			0
‘ they fluff up their feathers during cold weather so they trap air close to the body to keep them warm			0
’ for those of us who are n’t able to use such tactics , umbrellas and raincoats may come in useful today instead , as persistent showers are forecast into this evening			0

umbrella weather : shoppers in @entity107 , @entity108 , brave the worsening conditions to pick up @entity6 gifts weathering the storm : a man with an umbrella braves the downpour in @entity133 as the deluge swept the country ' landing heavy aircraft on grass would tear up the ground , so we 're now running passengers up from @entity101 to @entity141 , free of charge			1
