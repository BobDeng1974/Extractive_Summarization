the product range features perfume , body cream , shower cream and hair spray and the introductory price is of £ 28.90 for the next two weeks ' it was a shame that i did n't win and at the time it was such a massive deal but i am the only one who has gone on to do something			2
' in terms of proving @entity17 wrong , the winner @entity67 , from what she told me directly , informed @entity17 she did n't have any big plans for the next five years while she finishes school and uni , but in the meantime has bought an @entity74 with her 25k prize fund			0

i 'm never going to give up			0
' finishing third in the @entity99 in a twist where all the losing team were sent home was just the start of me , and it always would have been that way no matter where i finished			0
' outside of the boardroom @entity0 is just like any other teenager , he loves partying and having fun with his friends			2
@entity0 is wholly embarrassed by the photographs of him partying in @entity8 the rugby school boy caused a stir last year when he was photographed drinking a £ 1,000 bottle of @entity116 champagne in @entity117 haunt @entity8 with young blonde ladies hanging off his arm ( and face )			1
