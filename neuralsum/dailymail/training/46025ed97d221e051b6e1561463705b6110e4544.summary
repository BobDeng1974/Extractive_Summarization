forget robots designed to look like humans , in the future machines are more likely to resemble ostriches or dinosaurs			1
scientists believe the efficient way flightless birds - and their ancestors - move around on two legs could usefully be employed in robot design			1
a study has demonstrated how an ostrich 's speed , energy conservation and ability to stay upright is unmatched in other animals , including humans			2
forget robots designed to look like humans , in the future running machines are more likely to resemble ostriches or dinosaurs			1
scientists believe the efficient way flightless birds - and their ancestors - move on two legs ( illustrated ) could usefully be employed in robot design ' birds appear to be the best of bipedal terrestrial runners , with a speed and agility that may trace back 230 million years to their dinosaur ancestors , ' said lead researcher dr @entity32 , associate professor of @entity33 at @entity34			1
running birds such as ostriches and emus are not necessarily the most graceful movers , but they save energy and avoid falling , dr @entity32 explained			1
' these animals do n't care that they appear a little unstable or have a waver in their gait , ' he said			0
working with colleagues from the @entity46 in @entity47 , roboticists from @entity34 studied different species of birds			1
they used the results to develop a computer model that simulates the birds ' behaviour			2
the experts concluded that robot design ' must embrace a more relaxed notion of stability ' rather than focusing on a rock - steady gait			1
this was because the research showed that a wide variety of birds with very different body sizes all employ essentially the same running technique			2
to hop over objects on uneven ground , each of the birds used a largely ' vaulting ' motion followed by a more crouched posture when on top of the obstacle , for example			0
' the running robots of the future are going to look a lot less robotic , ' said dr @entity32			1
' they will be more fluid , like the biological systems in nature			0
' we 're not necessarily trying to copy animals , but we do want to match their capabilities			1
' ' their real goal is to limit peak forces , avoid falling , be safe and be as efficient as possible			0
' if their upper body seems to lurch around a little as a result , that 's okay			0
' what they are accomplishing is really quite elegant			0
' the research showed that a wide variety of birds with very different body sizes all employ essentially the same running technique			0
these ranged from quails to turkeys , emus and ostriches			2
to hop over objects on uneven ground , each of the birds used a largely ' vaulting ' motion followed by a more crouched posture when on top of the obstacle			0
unexpectedly , the scientists found that running birds do not prioritise stability in a rigid ' robotic ' way			2
instead , they allow their bodies to bounce around to some extent , while ensuring that they never fall			0
in order to stay upright , their leg movements may speed up or slow down , much like those of a scrambling rugby player			0
@entity34 doctoral student @entity122 , who co-authored the study , published in the @entity124 , said : ' we should ultimately be able to encode this understanding into legged robots so the robots can run with more speed and agility in rugged terrain			0
working with colleagues from the @entity46 in @entity47 , the scientists looked at different species of birds ( turkey pictured ) and used the results to develop a computer model that simulates their behaviour			1

instead , they allow their bodies to move with more ' fluid ' motions ' these insights may also help us understand the walking and running behaviours of all the common ancestors involved , including theropod dinosaurs such as the velociraptor			2

roboticists studied species of birds including emus , quails and ostriches
results were used to *create* computer models that simulated their behaviour
experts believe the efficient way these flightless birds - and their dinosaur ancestors - move could usefully be employed in robot design
they said robot design ' must embrace a more relaxed notion of stability '
and that running robots of the future are going to look a lot less robotic
' we 're not trying to copy animals , but we do want to match their capabilities , ' said dr @entity32
