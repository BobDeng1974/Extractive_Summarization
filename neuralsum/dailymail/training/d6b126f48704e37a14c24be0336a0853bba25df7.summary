it did n't take long for @entity2 's bite on @entity3 to viral - although perhaps people were expecting it			1
within moments of the @entity8 striker appearing to sink his teeth into @entity3 's shoulder fans were scanning the net for photos and video clips of the incident			1
and quick - thinking internet wizzes were putting together their best efforts to create viral jokes soon after			2
@entity73 , whose twitter handle is @ @entity2 , received so many vile tweets that he said he was considering closing his account down			2
' please stop i am not @entity78 , i am not @entity2 ' the unfortunate @entity70 tweeted			0
' i am not @entity2 , there are many @entity2 in the world '			0
@entity3 was subject to a shocking attack by @entity82 forward @entity2 , who sunk his teeth into his opponent just before @entity86 's matchwinner in @entity8 's 1 - 0 win			1
it was n't the first time that the @entity78 has sunk his teeth into an opponent			0
@entity92 's @entity91 and @entity94 's @entity93 were previous victims in 2013 and 2010 respectively			0
@entity96 stocking filler : the @entity2 bottle opener would probably be a best - seller if it was real spot the difference : @entity2 sinks his teeth into @entity91 doubled up : and then of course there was another @entity2 heat - map , this time showing his impact on @entity3 better option : chicken chain @entity106 were one of the first to reach out to the @entity8 striker with other options fancy an @entity110 ? and @entity111 were quick to follow up with an offer at one of their 90 @entity115 restaurants proof : some even joked about @entity119 's overused goal line technology that has been noted during the tournament how many times : @entity2 's previous misdemeanors had not gone unnoticed by football fans online @entity124 : was @entity2 's bite because he had n't eaten before kick - off in the @entity128 decider ? bite over bark : @entity2 has been likened to @entity20 before and again he is proving it 's not safe to be around him @entity131 in another biting storm			1
