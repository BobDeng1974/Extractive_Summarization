she is now begging surgeons to cut off her left foot , which is causing her medical complications - so she she can run faster and compete at the @entity24 she started sprinting on an @entity26 - style running blade - but says the strain on her ' good ' leg is now causing her constant pain and slowing her down			1

her stepfather @entity36 , 53 , said : ' we always thought the good leg was good and that was it , but in the last two years it 's taken a lot of strain			1
' she 's taking daily medication , wearing ankle and knee braces and even has a plate under her knee to support her			0
it 's all slowing her down			2
' @entity7 just wants to run and wo n't let anything hold her back - not even her foot			1
' miss @entity7 , from @entity50 , @entity51 , was born with developmental dysplasia of both hips and a dislocated right knee			1
the condition meant her hips would frequently dislocate and her right leg was unstable			1
at two months old , doctors cut tendons in her leg and operated more than 12 times in an attempt to improve her quality of life			2
but despite their best efforts , she was forced to rely on a wheelchair and was only able to get out with the aid of crutches			2

she won various medals , including gold and silver at the @entity113 , and has now set her sights on the @entity115 in 2016			0
but her constant training and competing has started to take its toll on her ' healthy ' left leg - and her race times have suffered as a result			2

mr @entity36 said : ' @entity7 's said to the surgeon that if they wo n't amputate she 'll go elsewhere			2

if she wants something , she 's going to get it			0
' @entity138 is her life and she does n't want it taken away from her			0
she competes in throwing events as well , but running has always been the main focal point and if you take it away from her it would devastate her			0
' she loves the freedom of running			0
what child would n't ? ' miss @entity7 said : ' getting the running blade made everything a lot better			2
' it enabled me to get into more sports and opened up a lot of activities for me that i could n't do before			0
' i want to become really good at what i do - the discus , shot and running			2
i also want to encourage more disabled people to get into sport			0
' i 'm not hoping for the operation , i just want to get better like anyone else would want			0
i 'll take anything to fix it , though			0
nothing will stop me doing my sport			0
' her family hope the hospital will make a decision on the amputation by november .			0

@entity7 , 15 , has the condition developmental dysplasia
meant her right leg was *effectively* useless and she relied on a wheelchair
decided in 2010 to have the leg amputated and was given a prosthetic limb
enabled her to take up sport and she developed a love of running
this has caused strain on her ' good ' leg , causing pain and slowing her down
now wants left foot - which has deformed toes and severe tendon damage - removed so she can run with two prosthetics and compete at paralympics
