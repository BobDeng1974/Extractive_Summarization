no one shouted ' fore ' when @entity10 's @entity9 teed off at the 14th hole during the @entity12 today , and watched his ball veer away from the green towards a crowd of spectators			1
the errant ball plunged from the sky straight onto the head of a fan standing in the front row , sending him sprawling onto his backside to a collective gasp from all around him			2
fore pity 's sake ! only the man 's legs can be seen in this shot as he falls back into the crowd moments after the errant ball struck him on the head good start : it started with @entity10 golfer @entity9 teed off on the 14th hole at the @entity12 in @entity36 no warning : the ball is seen flying through the air towards the green , before it begins to veer off course the ' clonk ' of ball - on - skull was so loud that it was even picked up by television microphones placed strategically about the green			1
even the commentators did not see the danger until the unfortunate victim was already on the grass			0
' oooh , he 's knocked that guy out			0
aaah , right on the head , ' says one of the announcers as the man swoons on the floor clutching his head			2
