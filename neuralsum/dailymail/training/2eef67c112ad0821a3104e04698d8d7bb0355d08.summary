dressed in tanned springbok skins peppered with elaborately embroidered ' owl eyes ' , the women of the @entity5 / ' hoansi @entity1 tribe might not look tough but with their lives spent in the @entity8 , one of the most inhospitable locations on @entity11 , that 's precisely what they are			1
' the @entity1 are thought to have lived in the area for more than 23,000 years , ' explains photographer @entity14 who captured these incredible images during a visit to @entity18 's @entity17 where many of the tribe still live			1
' most of them live by hunting in the @entity22 [ around @entity17 capital @entity24 or @entity25 in the local language ] , which is supposed to be controlled although the @entity1 have special permission , ' he continues			2
colourful : the women of the @entity1 tribe make their colourful beads from ostrich egg shells and make extra money by selling them to tourists tougher than @entity34 ! most members of the @entity1 tribe , this woman among them , live on the fringes of the inhospitable @entity8 useful : a woman carries a bi ! bulb , which offer a useful source of drinkable , if extremely bitter , water - extremely handy during desert hunting expeditions colourful : san people adore their brightly coloured beads , some of which are made from polished ostrich shell , and sell them to tourists to make extra money nomads : the @entity1 remain semi-nomadic but once wandered through all of southern @entity54 before other people moving in from the north pushed them into the @entity8 family life : the majority of @entity1 people who have stuck to their traditional lifestyle live in villages of five or six families and share everything ' they use traditional methods such as a bow and arrow tipped with the poisonous sap of the euphorbia plant			1
the arrow only needs to nick the animal 's skin for the poison to enter the bloodstream and the hunters track it until the animal collapses from the poison			0
' so expert are the hunting skills of the @entity1 , men from the tribe were sought after by successive governments and co-opted into the army as trackers ; most notoriously by @entity54 's apartheid regime who used them to hunt down @entity85 rebels			1
' they have a lot of superstitions about hunting , ' adds @entity14			0
' they say that if you walk face - first into a spider 's web while hunting , you 'll have bad luck , and if a man is a lazy hunter , he 'll become a source of shame to the entire clan			2
' although the men are no longer forced into the army , their hunting skills still prove valuable in the hostile @entity8 desert , as does the tribe 's incredible knowledge of plants			1
foraging is mostly done by the female half of the population , many of whom are expert gatherers and collect everything from ostrich eggs to plants , roots and insects			2
elaborate : much of the bead making work is done by older women who do n't have the energy to forage and they make extra money from it by selling jewels to tourists tough : the @entity8 covers 350,000sq miles of @entity18 , @entity125 and @entity54 and experiences temperatures of up to 45 degrees @entity127 during the day arid : the @entity8 is a semi-arid savannah and as a result , supports more plant and animal life than true deserts like the @entity134 in south - western @entity18 camp : women sit outside the grass and reed homes they inhabit when they 're on their n ! ore or family lands which many use as a retreat clever : san people know more than 300 different species of plants , many of which have medicinal purposes , whether treating rheumatism or combating hunger deadly : @entity1 hunters kill springboks , giraffes and other animals using poison tipped arrows and were once in high demand as army trackers tasty : a man cuts into an @entity162 , which the @entity1 call @entity164			1
it 's one of 100 species of edible plants included in @entity5 / ' hoansi @entity1 's diet lucrative : a man shows off a sprig of hoodia ; a plant traditionally used to stave off hunger pangs by the @entity1 and now marketed as a diet supplement in the @entity175 survival skills : a man holding a bi ! bulb which contains drinkable , if very bitter water ( left ) and another man sat in front of a fire created without using matches @entity14 travelled with guides from @entity187 and @entity188 , which offers a 12 - day tour that includes a visit to meet the @entity1 people plus accommodation , meals and transfers , with packages starting at £ 1,874 per person			1
for more information , see @entity198 @entity200 offers return flights to @entity202 from @entity203 via @entity204 from £ 1,010			0
for further information on @entity18 , please visit namibiatourism.com.na for more of @entity14 's work both in @entity18 and elsewhere , see ericlafforgue.com			0
one of the most helpful is a tuber called the bi ! [ milk ] bulb , which soaks up rainfall and once dug up , emits streams of drinkable - if bitter - water when crushed			0
even more valuable , both for survival and financially , is the hoodia plant which the @entity1 have long used as an appetite suppressant during long desert marches but is now being marketed as a weight loss supplement in the @entity175			1
so effective is the substance , the @entity18 government has had to pass a bill to prevent unscrupulous people from exploiting the @entity1 's knowledge of plants like hoodia , and another , devil 's claw , which they use to treat rheumatism			1
in total , the @entity5 / ' hoansi @entity1 use around 300 different plants , with 100 of those forming a regular part of the diet			1
' the @entity1 menu is mostly antelope , small animals , fruit such as the @entity241 , nuts , berries , roots and @entity246 melons , ' adds @entity14			2
' the children in particular love game meat			0
one little boy i met told me that his favourite food was giraffe ! ' while many of the @entity1 do continue to live traditional lifestyles , others have found jobs on farms and in tourism , and use their family 's n ! ore , or home patch of land , as a weekend retreat			2
others choose to live in the style of their ancestors - even indulging in the traditional courtship ritual that can prove to be , quite literally , a pain in the bottom for the women of the tribe			2
' if you want to reveal your love for a @entity1 woman , you take a little bow and shoot a tiny arrow into her bottom , ' reveals @entity14			2
' if the girl is n't interested , she ’ll slap you			0
if she is , you have to ask her parents or grandparents for permission to marry her			0
@entity283 does n't exist in @entity1 culture			0
' and , as @entity14 points out , neither does a passion for material things			0
' you ’ll never hear a @entity1 boasting about his exploits - people are part of an egalitarian society , so they never boast , ' he explains			1
' there 's also a lack of emphasis on prestige or wealth in @entity1 culture - something unusual in @entity54			1
' that 's how you do it ! a @entity1 man squeezes the water from a bu ! bulb during a hunt out in the wilds of the forbidding @entity8 desert medicinal : a hunter tucks into a piece of the @entity313 sericea plant which comes in handy when you have a cold - the plant is either eaten or wrapped around the head ouch ! one of the men demonstrates how to use a tiny bow and arrow , which @entity1 men use to shoot women they 've taken a shine to			1
if she slaps him , he 's out of luck friendly : materialism does n't exist in @entity1 culture and you 'll never hear them boasting or coveting lots of things as society is extremely egalitarian schoolgirl : many people have moved to towns such as @entity24 ( @entity25 in the local language ) so they can send their sons and daughters to school not a fan of ice cream ! when asked what his favourite food was by photographer @entity14 , this young man replied that it was giraffe work : many @entity1 have swapped traditional hunter - gatherer lifestyles for work as labourers on local farms , although many use their family lands as a weekend retreat women 's work : while much of the hunting is done by men , women are in charge of gathering edible roots , plants and insects as well as medicinal ones baffling : counting beyond 10 is a mystery for most @entity1 , who do n't have a translation for numbers beyond that and have to think hard about it if you ask thought to be more than 2,000 years old , the clicking sounds used by the @entity1 people might sound as if they 've been chosen completely random to those unfamiliar with them but are actually four distinct sounds , each of which has a different meaning			1
written , the main ones are / , = , ! , and # plus another known as ' the @entity378 ' because it sounds similar			0
bafflingly for those attempting to learn the language , the tribe as a whole speaks 20 different variants , each with clicks , but all different enough to be incomprehensible to speakers of a different dialect			0
the @entity1 's clicking language has also had an impact on the languages of other southern @entity54 tribes , among them the ! @entity393 of @entity18 and the ! @entity394 of @entity54 , both of which deploy clicks			1
despite the complexity of their language , the @entity1 approach to numbers is simple in the extreme			0
' @entity1 do n't count beyond 10 , ' says @entity14			0
' if you ask them how they say 26 or 52 , they need to think about it			0
' sadly , as @entity14 explains , the language is in danger as @entity1 children who go to school , a step seen as hugely important by @entity1 parents , are n't taught in their mother tongue			0
' education is very important in @entity1 culture as unemployment is very high in the community , ' explains @entity14			0
' in primary school , @entity1 kids do n't learn the @entity1 language as the teachers are @entity423 people			2
' traditional : san live in small villages of around five or six shelters , each created using reeds , grasses and plants taken from the @entity8 convivial : a group of @entity1 sit around their fire at the end of a long day labouring on local farms or hunting in the @entity8 desert adorable : a youngster peeps out from within a @entity441 skin wrap - the wraps are tied securely around the mother 's neck and back care : old people are taken care of by other members of their family and by members of the wider tribe who give them part of anything they gather or trap retreat : although many @entity1 have moved into town to work , lots return to their family n ! ore come weekends for a spot of rest and relaxation			1
