@entity1 manager @entity0 has warned that @entity2 will only be allowed to leave @entity3 for serious money			1
the powerful midfielder scored what turned out to be the winner in sunday 's 2 - 1 home victory over @entity9 who — as revealed by @entity11 earlier this month — have reignited their interest in adding him to the @entity15 squad			1
but @entity0 , experiencing his first win over his former club as @entity1 manager , said : ‘ we would want the going rate			1
we do n’t need to sell , we ’re debt free , everything is good			2
@entity2 heads the ball past @entity9 keeper @entity24 in @entity1 's win on sunday ‘ if the right offer came in , i ’m sure the chairman and the rest of the board would look at it			1
but the most important thing is to keep them here , let them progress and learn			2
‘ we would like to have done that with @entity35 ( @entity36 ) and @entity37 ( @entity38 ) in the summer — but there comes a point when it is too good to turn down , not just for the club but for the kids themselves			2
of course , silly money changes everything			2
‘ it was the same in the summer with @entity36			2
you do n’t want to sell him — but there comes a point when you have to accept it			0
‘ every team in @entity52 is a selling club			0
@entity9 is a selling club , so you could try to sell some of their players for the next few weeks			1
‘ speculation has been part of it since i came here			0
and it will be until the end of january when the window closes			2
‘ i ’m hopeful i will still have the same squad , maybe one or two players coming in , instead of going out			0
as revealed by @entity11 earlier in the month , @entity9 are interested in signing the central midfielder ( right ) ‘ it is a compliment to the players , it is always nice for them to be linked ( with other clubs )			1
‘ but , for the manager , it does n’t help			2
last year , it was n’t one or two , it was six or seven			0
‘ and we lost a couple mentally for a few weeks because of that			0
we sent @entity38 and @entity74 away on holiday			0
because of that , they took a little dip ( in form )			0
‘ @entity2 was linked , @entity81 was linked , @entity80 was linked			1
‘ hopefully , it is not as many this year — and there were no signs of losing focus against @entity9 today			1
‘ no doubt , as we get closer to the transfer window , everybody will be linked with somebody			2
’ @entity0 heaped praise on his team for getting the job done at @entity3 , singling out @entity93 — who was booked inside the opening minute , scored the opener and then provided a brilliant assist for @entity2 ’s goal — as a player worth all the effort to curb his volatile temper			1
‘ when @entity81 is on it , he is a handful			0
not just his goal but his set - up play for @entity2 to score as well			1
’ said @entity0 , whose team were made to sweat by @entity107 ’ late counter for @entity9			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 insisted the club will not sell @entity2 unless a decent offer comes in the striker , who came on as a 78th - minute substitute for @entity113 , also saw another effort bounce back off the post , whilst what appeared to be a perfectly good goal from @entity9 ’s @entity118 was ruled out for offside			1
@entity0 added : ‘ we have said all along @entity121 is a fantastic problem , who has taken a lot of hard work behind the scenes			1
‘ when he got booked after 30 seconds , that is part of it ! but i have said all along that he is worth the hassle at times because of what he can give to the team , the ability he has			0
’ @entity2 also lived up to his pre-match billing , @entity9 manager @entity136 having described him as a ‘ @entity139 type ’ , player who can cause damage to any opposition			1
his winner will have done little to lower the @entity145 ’s opinion of him			0
the question is whether @entity136 will have been impressed enough to pay a hefty transfer fee for a really promising footballer who has 18 months left on his @entity3 contract			2
@entity1 sold @entity38 ( above ) to @entity150 and @entity36 to @entity151 last summer ‘ it ’s a compliment more than anything , ’ said the 22 - year - old of the continued interest , adding : ‘ it gives you a bit of confidence and it is nice to hear of interest there			1
it helps in your game for @entity1			1
‘ everyone has dreams and ambitions but i like to focus on where i am at the moment and doing my best			0
‘ i did n’t see that @entity139 comparison			0
it is quite a compliment			0
he is a @entity173 winner — and not a bad player ! ‘ yes , it ’s nice to hear him paying those kind of compliments			0
it was n’t in my head today			0
‘ i always enjoy playing against @entity9			1
they are a good team , they pass the ball really well and it ’s good to compare yourself with the best quality in the country			0
everyone put on a good show today			0
’ meanwhile , @entity0 insisted his team , who move into second place in the table , should not be considered title contenders , arguing : ‘ it is still too early to say that			1
we have to be more consistent			0
