by @entity0 modern professional wrestling contains many theatrics and sometimes pre-determined outcomes			0
but although the lurid costumes might be new , there is now proof that ancient wrestling matches were fixed too			0
historians have deciphered a delicate @entity9 papyrus dating from @entity10 , which shows that the outcome of a wrestling match between two teenagers was predetermined			1
first proof of match fixing : historians have deciphered a delicate @entity9 papyrus ( pictured ) dating from @entity10 , which shows that a wrestling match between two teenagers was predetermined @entity19 lies south west of @entity21 and is considered to be one of the most important archaeological sites in @entity24			1
it has yielded a huge collection of papyrus texts from the @entity29 and @entity30 periods of @entity24 history and among them are fragments of plays and the @entity35			2
the city was built around a system of canals and inhabitants dumped their rubbish at nearby sand hills , including lots of written material as @entity19 was governed bureaucratically by the @entity9 and the @entity30			2
archaeologists have discovered tax returns , census material , receipts , letters about religion , politics , military action and diaries , giving them a thorough picture of everyday life			0
in 1896 , two young excavators - @entity56 and @entity57 - from the @entity58 began to excavate the site and combed through the rubbish			0
while they were concerned with finding works of high literature , they realised the importance of the discarded everyday material			0
some 500,000 papyrus fragments are now kept at the university 's @entity68 ; among them the account of match fixing			0
the contract is the first proof of match - fixing ever discovered			2
it was made between the father of a wrestler called @entity79 and the trainers of @entity81 who were set to wrestle in the final of the 138th ' @entity83 ' , which was a series of games held during a religious festival in @entity24			1
the contract says that @entity81 must ‘ when competing in the competition for the boy [ wrestlers ] ... fall three times and yield ’ and in turn he would be rewarded with ‘ three thousand eight hundred drachmas of silver of old coinage			1
’ the ancient bribe also contains a clause that @entity81 would still get his money if the judges picked up on the fact the match was fixed and refused to grant @entity104 victory			1
to make absolutely sure of a win , @entity79 ’ father arranged in the contract that if @entity81 backed out of the deal and went on to win , his trainers would have to pay a larger sum of money to his son			1
@entity113 , a professor at @entity114 who translated the papyrus , told @entity116 that 3,800 drachma - the cost of the original bribe - was not a large amount of money and could have bought a donkey			1
on your marks ! the contract says that @entity81 the wrestler must ' when competing in the competition for the boy [ wrestlers ] , to fall three times and yield ¿ and in turn he would be rewarded with ' three thousand eight hundred drachmas of silver of old coinage			1
' a frieze showing @entity9 wrestlers is pictured in a fair match , wrestlers fought to throw each other to the ground three times , using a number of holds and throws , some of which reportedly resembled body slams seen in modern professional wrestling			2
the contract was discovered in @entity19 , in @entity24 - around 100miles ( 160km ) south west of @entity21 - more than a century ago and has only been recently translated , with the document kept at the @entity68 at the @entity58			1
professor @entity113 explained that ancient people made such brides to reduce their losses as the training of athletes was expensive and there were no prizes for runners - up			0
an @entity24 treasure : the contract was discovered in @entity19 , in @entity24 ( marked by @entity158 ( 160km ) south west of @entity21 more than a century ago and has only been recently translated , with the document kept at the @entity68 at the @entity58 ‘ if you were confident you would win , normally you would go for it			1
if you 're not sure you would win , maybe you 're cutting your risk by saying , “ at least i get the bribe , ” ’ professor @entity113 said			0
it was not unusual for winners to be paid large amounts of money or to receive lifetime pensions			0
however , experts are baffled as to why a written contract was drawn up as it would have been difficult to take to court if either side backed - put of the deal			0
