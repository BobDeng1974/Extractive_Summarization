by @entity0 @entity1 must be the best loved pink - and - white cat in television history			1
his enduring popularity is one of the reasons the little stop - motion animation series made by my father @entity9 and his creative partner @entity11 is still being voted @entity15 's favourite children 's tv series decades after it was first broadcast			1
but he very nearly was n't pink and white at all			0
@entity11 , whose idea it was to make a series about a magical cat whose thoughts could be seen , wanted @entity1 to be marmalade and white but when the special fluffy fabric came back from the dyers something had gone wrong : the stripes were n't remotely orange , they were pink			1
@entity1 , the famous pink and white cat , turns 40 this year @entity11 , however , decided to go with the creative flow - something he and my father did a lot - and pressed ahead			1
and so it was that @entity1 ' the most important , the most beautiful , the most magical ... saggy old cloth cat in the whole wide world ' was born			1
by the time @entity1 was first broadcast in 1974 , i was a sophisticated ten - year - old , so it did n't matter at all to me that the human star of the show was @entity37 , the youngest of @entity11 's six daughters and my regular friend and playmate			1
besides , i 'd already had my own go in front of my father 's camera , playing a guard in another of their tv shows , @entity49			2
i 'm now a cartoonist - turned - illustrator - turned - writer , and spend part of my time looking after @entity59 , the company my father created in the 50s and through which he and @entity11 made such much - loved children 's classics as @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 , as well as @entity1			1
bagpuss with his creator , @entity9 @entity1 was shot in the big barn at @entity11 's farm - a dusty , mysterious but definitely magical place - using a camera that @entity65 had modified to shoot a single frame at a time using bits of @entity68			1
that habit of making do and mending is very much at the heart of @entity1 , with each of the 13 episodes beginning with a lost object that @entity37 had found and @entity65 's narration kicking off each story with the magical words ... ' @entity1 , dear @entity1 , ' old fat , furry cat - puss , ' @entity81 and look at this thing that i bring			1
' and with that @entity1 would wake up , the picture turned from sepia to colour and the mice from the mouse - organ would get busily to work , cheerily cleaning up the lost object , while @entity1 told a story , helped and hindered by @entity90 the rag - doll , @entity92 the banjo - playing toad and professor @entity1 , the blustering and fearsomely intellectual wooden woodpecker			2
along the way , there 'd be some sort of lovely folk - song too , beautifully sung by @entity101 and @entity102 , who respectively provided the voices for @entity92 and @entity90			0
@entity65 , who 'd been to drama school as well as art college , had the most wonderful voice for telling stories , a voice that i 've learned , since he died in 2008 aged 83 , was woven into the childhoods of millions of children who grew up in the 60s and 70s			0
for @entity1 , he provided the voices of the narrator , @entity1 and professor @entity1 , the latter being secretly based on the great radical philosopher , @entity116 , who my father knew as a child			1
@entity65 's own father , my grandfather , was @entity121 , who somehow managed to combine being a highly regarded left - wing historian with setting up the annual restaurant guidebook @entity124 , and @entity116 had been a regular visitor to their north @entity126 home			2
@entity116 's high - minded , slightly halting delivery had clearly left its mark on @entity65 but the decision to give @entity1 similar vocal characteristics was an affectionate one for he and @entity65 shared many similar views , particularly when it came to pacifism and nuclear disarmament			1
@entity0 revealed that he is working on a new series of the @entity56 some of these views he secretly passed on to @entity1 , a fact he took great pleasure in revealing when the @entity138 presented @entity11 and him with honorary degrees at @entity141 in 1987			1
they 'd taken @entity1 along as guest of honour , with @entity65 proudly announcing to the assembled throng that the pink - and - white cat was definitely ' a @entity146 '			2
in 1999 @entity1 was voted @entity147 in a @entity149 poll , an accolade that delighted @entity65 and @entity11 and caused sales of merchandise - and particularly of pink - and - white cats - to go through the roof			2
suddenly , after decades of just scraping by , they had some money			0
characteristically , they spent a big chunk of it paying for a new wing to be built for a @entity163 children 's hospice			0
@entity65 said it was what @entity1 would have wanted			0
' @entity65 had the most wonderful voice for telling stories , a voice that i 've learned was woven into the childhoods of millions of children who grew up in the 60s and 70s ' @entity1 may have been filmed in a converted @entity175 barn but , for its 40th anniversary , we 've just had it digitally restored			0
all 13 episodes look absolutely wonderful - @entity65 would have been proud and i know @entity11 is because he still lives just down the road , as does @entity37 , who is now an artist			0
although @entity11 technically retired last year , at 85 he 's busier than ever , and we 're working on a new series of the @entity56			1
i 'm writing the scripts and @entity11 is the design consultant , and he 's already creating various bits and bobs			0
3 months the original series ran for , from 12 february 1974 until 7 may 1974 13 the total number of episodes made - but they ended up being shown on rotation for 26 weeks a year over the next 13 years @entity190 has been contributed to the @entity15 economy so far by merchandise featuring the pink - and - white cat 15 minutes is the total length of each episode - and the first 2 minutes and 51 seconds of each is identical we have no immediate plans to make new episodes of @entity1 , although i 'm regularly asked about it			1
i 'm very wary ; it 's so idiosyncratic , so very much @entity65 and @entity11 's creation			0
but i have n't totally rejected a proposal from an @entity205 company			0
an @entity205 company ? i can hear shrieks of horror from @entity1 's millions of loyal @entity15 fans			2
but @entity205 do understand @entity1 - make do and mend is a big thing in the @entity212 and i can see an old clapboard shop somewhere on the coast of @entity215 with a large pink - and - white cat presiding , a little sleepily , over all sorts of gently paced , slightly wistful fun			2
he 'd still be baggy and just a bit loose at the seams but the important thing is that @entity37 would still love him			0
because it would n't be @entity1 if she did n't			0
happy birthday @entity1 , a book of projects to make , is out now from @entity228 , Â £ 11.99 .			0

@entity1 , the series about a cloth cat , turns 40 this year
here its creator 's son , @entity0 , *remembers* @entity1 and his father
he reveals he is working on a new series of the @entity56
