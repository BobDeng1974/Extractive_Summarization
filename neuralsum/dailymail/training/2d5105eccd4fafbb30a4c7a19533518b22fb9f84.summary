in fact , @entity16 , @entity13 -- population 1,781 -- has another hometown hero in @entity20 with 3 - time @entity23 women 's hockey star and the 2005 high school prom queen to @entity4 's king @entity25			1
and that 's just this year			0
the little village just six frigid miles from the @entity29 border has sent a total of seven hockey players to @entity32 over the decades , all of whom have won medals except @entity4			1
idols on ice : @entity4 ( left ) has found overnight stardom in the wake of saturday 's win against @entity11 but his high school classmate and prom queen to his king @entity25 ( right ) is on her third olympics in @entity20 on the @entity8 women 's hockey team hometown heroes : the storefront window of @entity50 in @entity16 , @entity13 , the remarkable town that 's produced seven @entity23 hockey greats including @entity4 ( left ) and @entity25 ( right ) despite having fewer than 2,000 residents @entity55 , nestled at the banks of @entity13 's @entity54 , may very well be a necessary part of every @entity23 lineup : no @entity60 men 's team has ever won a gold medal without having a @entity55 player on its roster			1
the tiny town is filled with tributes to @entity4 and @entity66			2
store windows are plastered with posters wishing the @entity70 good luck , and huge @entity60 flags hang everywhere			0
there 's a long history of hockey greatness in this rural outpost , where the cold winters make for perfect ice - skating conditions			2
' from the time kids are tiny their parents have them in skates , ' said @entity81 , who owns a retail store in town			0
' from the time they 're 2 or 3 , they 've got them in the rink			0
' @entity25 , whose grandfather @entity89 coached the @entity60 men 's team in the 1960s , won silver four years ago in @entity94			1
and @entity95 , an @entity96 , won silver with the @entity60 team in 1972			1
then there are the @entity100			0
@entity101 played on the @entity103 team that beat the @entity104 in 1980 en route to winning the gold medal			1
his father , @entity108 , and uncle , @entity110 , helped the @entity60 win gold at the 1960 games and played in the 1964 games in @entity114 , @entity115			1
pop. 1,781 : the town of @entity16 is located just six miles south of the @entity29 border signs are everywhere : a towel on display at the @entity122 in @entity16 , @entity13 , that proclaims the tiny town @entity124 because of its century - long love affair with the sport another uncle , @entity127 , took silver in 1956			1

according to legend , the hockey tradition in @entity16 dates back to the days before the @entity32 even existed			1
and not surprising , to a relative of @entity25 's			2
the @entity141 reports that , at the @entity143 , a preserved anecdote traces the town 's hockey obsession at least to 1907 , when @entity25 's great grandfather stepped off a train from @entity148 and was immediately asked , ' do you play hockey ? ' ' i think it 's pretty amazing that we 're such a small town and we get such big opportunities , ' said @entity156 , 16 , a sophomore at @entity157			1
' people here are so talented			0
' @entity156 joked that children in @entity16 , which bills itself as @entity124 , learn to skate before they can walk			2
but there is some truth to it			0
@entity60 forward @entity4 , left , is congratulated by goalie @entity163 , right , after @entity4 scored the game - winning goal in a shootout against @entity11 in a men 's ice hockey game at the @entity169 , saturday , feb. 15 , 2014 , in @entity20 , @entity11			1

( @entity0 photo / the @entity172 , @entity173 ) hockey dynasty : @entity25 's grandfather coached the 1960s men 's @entity23 team and her great grandfather is part of a @entity16 legend in which he stepped from a train from @entity148 in 1907 and was immediately asked by a native , ' do you play hockey ? ' whether @entity4 can duplicate his predecessors ' success remains to be seen , though his four shootout goals on six attempts at the end of saturday 's preliminary round game have put him in the spotlight			1
@entity194 hockey coach @entity193 , for whom @entity4 played for three years , remembered his protege as an intense competitor who had a knack for rising to the occasion			2
the bigger the stage , the better @entity4 plays , @entity193 said			0

' you saw he had a little grin on his face before he took each shootout			0
that 's just him out there having fun and competing			0
' @entity4 has said he tries to be unpredictable with his shot selections in high - pressure situations , and he leads the @entity212 with seven shootout goals in 10 tries this season			2
while @entity4 might not be a household name , hockey fans respect him as one of the best , his former coach said			2
' today he introduced himself to the world , ' @entity193 said			0
' i think his personality will really endear people to him			0
he 's such a humble , fun - loving guy			0
and then when he gets on the ice he competes as hard â € ” or harder â € ” than anybody out there			0
' after saturday 's win , @entity4 addressed the expectations of his fans back home			1
' i 'm definitely going to try to represent the town and obviously the country as best i can , ' @entity4 said			0
