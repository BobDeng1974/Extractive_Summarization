by @entity0 published : 10:59 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 20:27 est , 20 november 2012 the @entity1 was yesterday forced to reset the user names and computer passwords of dozens of @entity5 staff following an embarrassing security blunder over pictures of prince @entity8			1
ten photographs of the future king in his role as a search and rescue helicopter pilot were published by @entity13 yesterday on the @entity15 ’s website before being cleared by the @entity1 the pictures , taken by an @entity5 photographer , had been intended to show off a ‘ day in the life ’ of the prince on base as flight lieutenant @entity21 at @entity23 on @entity24 , north @entity21			1
blunder : the shots of the @entity15 at @entity23 were re-released after being pulled when officials realised sensitive information was visible on computer screens in the background ' administrative oversight ' : the @entity1 was forced to reset some computer usernames and passwords following the mistake the withdrawn pictures were re-released after sensitive information on computer screens visible in the background had been pixelated they were considered something of a coup for his new website , www.dukeandduchessofcambridge.org			1
but the publicity exercise back - fired within hours as it emerged that sensitive information was visible in four of the shots			1
in one , @entity8 is in a briefing room in front of a computer with a password prompt screen open			2
another shows a document on the desk and an email open on a computer			0
other photographs show details of passwords and user names pinned up on a wall			1
despite being second in line to the throne , prince @entity8 is happy to do a tea round for his @entity5 colleagues the @entity15 has a tiny bedroom like any other officer and he even has to make the bed , pictured a day in the life : the @entity15 pictured during an aircraft check whilst working as a helicopter search and rescue pilot at @entity23 on @entity24 , @entity21 ' day in the life ' : the pictures were released to give a glimpse into the @entity15 's work as a search and rescue helicopter pilot by the time horrified defence officials spotted the mistake – some four hours after publication online – the shots had appeared on websites around the world , on tv and in newspapers including the @entity84 in @entity85			1
they were ‘ re-released ’ with the details pixellated , but the @entity1 had no choice but to reset passwords of some personnel ‘ as a precaution ’			1
it said : ‘ due to an administrative oversight , these photographs were not properly cleared at @entity23			1
they have now been amended			0
’ @entity13 said : ‘ the pictures were taken by an @entity5 photographer and any security issues are a matter for the @entity1 ’ the amended photos , which capture the prince 's normal working day , show that while the @entity15 may be second in line to the throne , as a working member of the @entity5 prince @entity8 clearly does n’t stand on ceremony			1
the photographs of prince @entity8 on duty at @entity23 were published on the @entity15 and @entity108 of @entity15 's new official website , which was unveiled as the couple prepare to create their own court at @entity112			1
the establishment of the @entity114 of the @entity15 and @entity108 and prince @entity115 is being viewed as a sign @entity8 is preparing to leave his role as a search and rescue helicopter pilot to embark on a life of @entity121 duty with wife @entity108			0
the couple 's official activities , including the new website , are being funded by @entity125 using his income from the @entity127 , his private estate			0
as flight lieutenant @entity21 of the @entity131 ( @entity132 ) unit based at @entity23 on @entity24 , north @entity21 , @entity8 is happy to brew up a pot of tea and make his own bed			0
whether taking the controls of his sea king helicopter or enjoying a plate of pasta and a laugh with his crewmates , it is clear that the prince loves his ‘ normal ’ life in the forces			0
although he shares a rented farmhouse with his wife , @entity108 , when on round - the - clock duty @entity8 stays in staff accommodation on base			1
his tiny bedroom is just like that of any officer – containing a chair , desk and single bed , which he has to make himself in the morning			0
@entity8 , 30 , can also be seen using the base ’s tiny kitchen to make a cup of tea as he and his colleagues make up their flight plans and wait for their next ‘ shout ’			0
the prince ’s working day begins with a briefing from the off - going @entity132 crew about the state of their aircraft and weather conditions			1
as his crew need to be airborne within 15 minutes of receiving a call - out from the moment they go on duty , such briefings are a hugely important part of their shift			2
according to the website , the future king often likes to while away the hours waiting for his next emergency call by playing video games , particularly @entity181 or other military - themed games			2
enjoying a meal with his @entity5 colleagues : prince @entity8 wearing his green uniform tucks into his dinner flight lieutenant @entity21 sits back in a comfy arm chair and relaxes during ' downtime ' however as @entity132 crews are , like many in the forces , expected to fly into conditions from which others are fleeing , much of their day is spent honing and maintaining their flying skills			0
@entity8 has been based at @entity23 since 2010			0
he qualified as a helicopter captain in june and now leads a four - man crew			2
@entity23 is renowned for covering some of the most varied and challenging terrain in the @entity203 , involving both sea and mountain rescues			0
on duty he works a 24 - hour shift at the base and must never be more than 60 seconds from his machine , ready to be airborne			2
lt. @entity21 carries out pre-flight checks in a @entity213 during his working day the prince has been involved in several dramatic missions , most recently one in august in which he rescued two teenage girls who were being swept out to sea			0
many of those he has helped to rescue say they were n’t even aware of his identity at the time			0
with pressure growing on the prince to give up his life in the military to relieve the burden on his elderly grandparents , the pictures may become one of the most precious records of his much - loved stint in the military			1
@entity8 must decide by the beginning of next year whether to extended his current tour of duty , which concludes next september			0
although he was initially keen to extend his service , the prince is acutely aware of calls to become a full time working royal , particularly in light of his elderly grand - father ’s recent bouts of ill - health .			2
