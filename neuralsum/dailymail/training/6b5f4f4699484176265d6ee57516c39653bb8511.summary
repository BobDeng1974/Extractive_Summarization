the man leading the hunt for the missing @entity2 has revealed search experts are considering 1,000 possible paths it could have taken			1
@entity6 of the @entity7 said his team were faced with an ' intimidating ' and ' unprecedented ' challenge as they prepare to launch a year - long off shore search for the missing craft			1
the aircraft vanished on march 8 with 239 passengers and crew on board after it departed @entity16 in @entity17 to @entity18 in @entity19			2
the @entity26 government has released an updated map showing the new , smaller search area for @entity2 over the past six months , international experts searched for the aircraft using a range of data in a bid to narrow down the crash site			1
mr @entity6 told the @entity35 that a ' reasonably clear picture ' of the plane 's trajectory was emerging , even if there were still approximately 1,000 possible paths it could have taken			2
he said : ' there is an infinite possible number of tracks that the aircraft could have flown along , but for practical purposes there are about 1,000 ... from the point of its turning south			1
' extensive aerial searches failed to spot any wreckage from the airliner , but experts have studied radar and satellite data in a bid to close in on the crash site			0
mr @entity6 said new seabed surveys have also produced some interesting findings including hard objects that seem inconsistent with their surroundings , although there is no guarantee that this is the aircraft			0
he told @entity64 : ' there is nothing that has screamed out and said " i look like an aircraft "			0
' it 's still a hell of an area			2
the area is horribly , horribly complicated			0
' experts have spent the past six months remapping large areas of the sea floor to facilitate the search @entity26 deputy pm @entity76 , right , signed a memorandum of understanding with the @entity17 transport minister @entity79 @entity79 in @entity80 to agree to fund the renewed search mr @entity6 earlier wrote on his blog that the new search will concentrate on a 60,000 square kilometre area of the southern @entity85			1
' the complexities surrounding the search can not be understated			0
it involves vast areas of the @entity85 with only limited known data and aircraft flight information			1
' while it is impossible to determine with certainty where the aircraft may have entered the water , all the available data indicates a highly probable search area close to a long but narrow arc of the southern @entity85			1
' the search will be a major undertaking			0
the complexities and challenges involved are immense , but not impossible			0
' the best minds from around the world have been reviewing , refining and localising the most likely area where the aircraft entered the water , which is why we remain confident of finding the aircraft			2
' last month the @entity17 and @entity26 governments signed a memorandum of understanding where they both agreed to fund the renewed search effort .			0

experts warn ' infinite number of tracks aircraft could *'ve* flown along '
comes as team 's prepare for a year long off shore search for missing craft
search will concentrate on 60,000 square km area of southern @entity85
