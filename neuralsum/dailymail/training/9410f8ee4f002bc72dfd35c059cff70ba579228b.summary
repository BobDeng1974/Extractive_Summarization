those anticipating a halt to the @entity2 during these winter months were again confounded by his all - action performance against @entity5			1
two goals and one assist to add to his collection this season put @entity11 ’s side to the sword and enhanced @entity14 ’s position as the most potent forward in the @entity15			1
his £ 32million fee from @entity17 grows in value by the day			0
no player has been involved in more @entity15 goals than @entity14 : 19			1
he has struck the back of the net 12 times himself , and made seven assists			1
@entity14 has hit the ground running since joining the @entity15 with @entity26 from @entity17 @entity14 celebrates scoring for @entity26 against @entity5 at the @entity27 in the @entity15 @entity14 has been a huge hit at the @entity27 since arriving from @entity17 for £ 32m during the summer his cross for @entity30 to open the scoring at the @entity27 on sunday was inch - perfect , requiring the application of a most straight - forward of headers			1
@entity14 has played up front , in the hole and out wide – drifting in to cause mayhem			1
his first goal against @entity5 came that path ; from the left wing he had the strength to ride @entity42 ’s challenge , the silk to dribble into the box and dispatch a precise shot inside @entity47 ’s near post			2
the @entity49 ’s talent has never been in doubt			0
he starred for his country at two @entity52 , and for @entity17 over three seasons			0
but the sheer bloody - mindedness he has approached @entity55 football has been remarkable			0
many believed he would suffer a dip without the luxury of winter break ; his body , that 5ft 7in muscular frame which allows his breathless style , would require a few weeks to rest and recuperate			0
that is not the indication so far			0
he has played 30 games in all competitions this season , many times man - of - the - match			1
at 26 he has plenty more years to make good on his early promise to become a club figurehead			0
@entity14 's attitude has been remarkable since his summer move to @entity26 after starring at the @entity74 @entity14 celebrates after he scored @entity26 's second goal in the 2 - 2 draw with @entity77 in september although @entity26 manager @entity79 is acutely aware of the dangers of overloading the team ’s talisman , @entity78 believes @entity14 ’s natural energy can carry him through			1
‘ @entity14 absolutely loves it			2
he is like a @entity88 battery - he just does not give in , ” the @entity85 midfielder said			0
‘ whether it is a cup competition or times when you think maybe it could be a chance for him to come out and rest , he is the first one to say he wants to play and he always wants to be a part of it			0
@entity78 ( left ) has hailed @entity14 as @entity26 's ' @entity88 ' this season ‘ i am sure if the boss wants to rest him , he would respect that as well , but his attitude and the way he approaches training , you would n’t think he was tired and the way he is playing , you would n’t take him out of the side either			1
‘ hopefully , he can keep his fitness and keep going , but the athlete that i see every day , i ca n’t see him falling short anytime soon			0
’ @entity106 watched on from the stands on sunday , and the signs are @entity14 could become @entity26 ’s first talisman since the @entity110 departed			1
it is not lip service to say legendary status awaits			0
former @entity114 legend @entity106 ( centre ) was in the stands on sunday to witness @entity14 's display take @entity14 ’s impact out of @entity79 ’s team and they would be 19th in the division			1
clearly those statistics do not allow for another player to come in and potentially bridge the gap			2
but the extent of his importance is clear			0
without those 19 contributions to goals , @entity26 would be 14 points worse off			1
@entity26 are out of the top four because their defence is susceptible to moments of comical collapse and their midfielder lacks a general to impose order			2
but , were @entity79 to address these issues in the summer market , @entity14 is the player to spur a title charge			2
he is a player to build a team around , a dynamo whose energy and potential appears limitless .			2

@entity14 has scored 12 goals and made seven assists this season
it is more involvement in goals than any other @entity15 player has
the @entity26 forward scored in their latest win over @entity5 at the @entity27
@entity14 has played up front , in the hole and out wide for the @entity114
the @entity157 forward has played 30 games in all competitions this season
