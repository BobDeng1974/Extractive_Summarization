getting kids looking spick and span and sitting still for a family portrait is never an easy task but it 's even tougher when you have to do it with baby orangutans			2
but renowned wildlife photographer @entity8 managed to wrangle this cheeky group together long enough to take these photographs			1
the 62 - year - old snapper travelled all the way to @entity13 from his home in @entity15 , @entity16 , to meet these rehomed orphans - aged one to three - who , in the absence of their parents , have learned to love each other as siblings			1
these orphaned orangutans were photographed at a rescue centre in @entity13			1
although they have lost their parents , that have bonded as if they were siblings mr @entity8 , who spent the trip photographing orangutans both in the wild and - as with the orphans - at the @entity30 , said : ' i decided to visit @entity13 because i heard the main habitat for these rare animals , the forest , has been disappearing rapidly due to deforestation			1
' i wanted to see how they live in the wild with my own eyes			0
' because of the fast pace of deforestation activities , the total number of wild orangutans has been decreasing rapidly			1
' at the same time the number of orphans , who have seen their habitat being destroyed , has been increasing dramatically			0
' orangutans are peaceful animals who love to live quietly			1
deforestation has destroyed the animals ' homes and decimated their population a baby orangutan studies its mother 's mouth , learning how she uses it to perform different tasks			2
it can take up to eight years for a mother to fully raise her young ' although there are community activities , they always strive to avoid unnecessary social tensions			0
' as i press the shutter of my camera , i wish the forest , which has provided orangutans with a safe and abundant environment since time immemorial , remains a place where future generations can prosper and live in peace			0
' over the last 60 years , @entity13 's orangutan population has fallen by more than half , with less than 69,000 being left on the island			2
in just the last two decades , the rainforests where the animals live have been stripped back by 55 per cent			0
mr @entity8 also photographed a young orangutan observing his mother 's mouth at @entity81			2
he said : ' an infant always plays with their mother 's mouth and observe how they use it to accomplish various tasks			0
these cute and moving pictures were taken by famous @entity16 wildlife photographer @entity8 ' it takes about 6 to 8 years for a female orangutan to raise an infant			1
' they build comfortable nest structure in the forest canopy , and stay together living a quiet and peaceful life until the babies become independent			0
' it is fairly uncommon to encounter a group with several babies in the wild			0
' the @entity102 was established in 1986 by conservationist dr @entity103 , who has experience in forest and orangutan protection			0
she wanted to protect the animals who have become orphans as a result of deforestation .			1
