' you 're ostensibly teaching or trying to teach history or call attention to a particular historical moment , yet there 's no explanation , there 's no education , there 's no teaching going on , ' he said			0
' and so , for someone who is probably , at nine years of age , has maybe heard of slavery but probably does n't know what it is really like , their first , perhaps , and most lasting impression about this historical event comes in a very abstracted , nonchalant type of thing that they have no real sense of connection to			0
