by @entity0 last updated at 7:55 am on 9th february 2012 @entity3 telecoms company @entity1 and @entity4 already has @entity7 's hotly anticipated @entity6 device in its labs , a report in @entity3 's @entity10 has claimed			0
two unnamed sources speaking to the paper report that the flatscreen device will be voice controlled , using software similar to the @entity17 voice control on @entity18 , and will offer @entity20 - style apps			1
it will also offer gesture control , with users able to manipulate apps from the sofa using hand gestures to type on an on - screen virtual keyboard			1
@entity7 already offers slim flatscreens in its @entity30 range : tech insiders widely expect an @entity6 by the end of 2012 - and @entity34 's details tally with several previous rumours @entity7 is widely rumoured to be introducing such a device this year			1
the details tally broadly with details leaked from a survey from @entity41 retailer @entity34 - asking customers what they might think of an ' all - new @entity7 hdtv '			1
the @entity34 survey sparked interest because it was remarkably specific about details - namely that the device would be a 42 - inch 1080p television , would run @entity50 and other @entity18 - style apps , and would cost $ 1499 @entity18 link : the voice - controlled @entity17 ' personal assistant ' is designed so you can talk to it like a normal person - the ideal way to change channel and adjust the volume on @entity7 's new tv ? the survey , sent out by @entity63 survey firm @entity62 , polled customers on what they would think of an upcoming @entity7 hi - def television			1
the survey also claimed that the television would offer remote - control via @entity20 and @entity18 , as well as web tv such as @entity71			1
the slogan is supposedly , ' @entity7 finally reinvents what a tv can do			0
' less convincingly , the survey also suggested that it would include an isight camera - a brand @entity7 no longer uses - and offer @entity77 , unlikely given that @entity7 has its own rival , @entity79			0
the @entity80 , which found and confirmed the survey , said , ' is @entity34 speaking with knowledge , or is it just riffing to get a sense of customer interest in a purely theoretical @entity7 television ? our guess is that it 's nothing more than a shot on the dark			2
' @entity34 's survey has been confirmed to be genuine , and from @entity63 survey firm @entity62 - a partner of the retail giant the fact that @entity7 is working on a hi - def television now looks near - certain			2
leaks from @entity7 's manufacturing chain say that @entity7 has been working on prototype sets since september - according to a design blueprint laid down by late ceo @entity102			0
his ' eureka ' moment was realising that @entity17 's voice control could be used to ' talk ' to the set			1
' i finally cracked it , ' said @entity102			0
@entity102 was referring to the realisation that the television should be voice - controlled - using the natural - language algorithms of @entity17 so that people talk to the set as they would to someone sitting next to them on the sofa			1
@entity6 debuts at @entity117 in @entity118 : reports say that @entity7 is working on a large , voice - controlled touchscreen with the service built in - but it wo n't arrive till the price for large touchscreens drops a little mr @entity102 , who died in october , told author @entity124 : ' it will have the simplest user interface you could imagine			2
' @entity7 executive @entity127 , who was behind the @entity129 and @entity128 , is reportedly ' now guiding @entity7 's internal development of the new tv effort '			0
it 's not the first attempt to bring more ' natural ' controls to televisions - companies such as @entity136 already make gesture - controlled remotes which you simply ' wag ' at the screen , and @entity142 's @entity141 camera can be controlled by voice			2
tv companies such as @entity145 have brought out rival devices in the wake of rumours about @entity6			0
@entity145 's ' @entity151 ' remote will be motion controlled and voice controlled			0
the new ' @entity151 ' voice remote will let users speak to control their televisions - a microphone and voice - recognition software built into the remote make your voice work like an internet search ' the new @entity161 will make it easier for users to approach @entity163 - particularly our @entity165 function which now has over 1,000 apps , ' said @entity168 , president of @entity145			1
but the highly sophisticated @entity17 software could represent a huge leap forward for the technology			0
a third party analysis suggests the device will hit shelves by late next year or 2013 , based on research of @entity7 's patent portfolio , its investments in manufacturing facilities and ' securing supplies of lcd screens ' .			0
