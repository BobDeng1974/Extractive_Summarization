@entity0 and @entity1 were at the top of @entity5 ’s @entity4 skyscraper			1
oh no ! were they about to jump ? happily it was nothing to do with an opinion poll suggesting both will lose their seats			2
instead they had hurriedly called a @entity13 pr event to try to scupper a big @entity15 event promoting the @entity16 ’ ‘ northern powerhouse ’ idea			1
the @entity4 venue was mad , delicious , screamingly vulgar : the 52nd - floor , @entity21 - accented @entity20 of the @entity23 hotel ( minimum spend per head 30 quid )			1
welcome to utopia and the ‘ timeless allure of the @entity27 ’ , as the bar ’s slogan goes			2
are n’t they in the @entity44 three - quarter line ? waiters shimmered in white , collarless uniforms , as favoured by dental nurses			2
we were greeted by wide - smiled beauties			2
@entity13 sportsman @entity50 would have been beside himself , had he only been there			1
instead we had perhaps ten non-media attendees , not all @entity13			1
the suited gent ’ next to me was witheringly rude about the party			0
how had the @entity13 paid for this chi - chi pad ? our host was a busy little puffball in a plum - coloured velvet jacket flourishing a top - pocket , silk hankie			1
his name was @entity63 and he was giving out business cards like after - dinner mints			0
he looked like @entity66 in @entity67			0
@entity68 and decent @entity69 ( quite chunky these days ) scuttled in and stood in the corner			0
their backdrop should have been the glittering @entity73 but the view was of mist			0
a low cloud ’s bright light cast the two mps ’ faces into shadow			0
@entity0 watched with a sullen air			1
why so cheesed - off ? hand in pocket , a diagonal expression			0
@entity85 stewed in his eyes			0
@entity88 ’s @entity87 asked mr @entity0 if he was going to lose his @entity90 seat			1
in a spurt of petulance @entity68 said the poll was ‘ complete and utter nonsense ’ got up by the trade unions			0
he had hoped @entity88 might have asked about @entity13 fiscal policies			1
but what will be the point of manifesto pledges on tax / spending ratios if @entity68 and @entity1 are both decapitated by the electorate ? what , indeed , is the point of any @entity13 manifesto , seeing as it can only be a precursor to coalition talks ? mr @entity0 was acidic about his @entity106 partners , accusing them of being cruel to the poor			1
the @entity109 was derided rather less , though mocked for wanting to put bills on the ‘ never - never ’			0
mr @entity0 ( pictured ) said his party ’s ‘ sensible , balanced approach would bring an end to the era of austerity in three years ’ time while protecting public services and the most vulnerable in society @entity68 four times described the @entity16 as ‘ ideological ’ , as though this was undesirable in mps			1
the opposite of an ideological politician , i suppose , is an opportunistic one ? is that preferable ? cliches bubbled : ‘ economy back on track ... let us finish the job ... our plan ... fairness , etc. ’ mr @entity0 claimed that the @entity13 were the party of stability			1
priceless ! he mentioned the @entity131 and the @entity132 , though not the @entity133 ( where @entity134 has his seat )			0
venomous @entity134 ’s name was mentioned at one point			0
mr @entity0 , hearing it , immediately started to shake his head			1
and he took a swipe at the @entity16 ‘ mismanaging their inner demons on @entity143 ’			0
is @entity144 mr @entity0 himself not a teensy bit ‘ ideological ’ on the @entity147 ? a reporter asked if the @entity13 and their higher tax policies had any supporters in the business world			1
mr @entity0 said they did : a chap called @entity155 who runs innocent drinks			2
any others ? @entity68 said he would send the reporter ‘ a postcard ’ with further names of @entity13 business backers			2
not so many of them , then			0
not everything was audible , because a @entity164 reporter started doing a loud live broadcast in the room while mr @entity0 was talking			2
velvet - jacketed mr @entity63 told the reporter to be quiet			0

@entity0 and chief secretary to the treasury @entity1 at @entity4
pair spoke at the @entity33 on the 52nd floor of @entity5 skyscraper
@entity0 said @entity13 would pursue higher ratio of tax rises to spend cuts
