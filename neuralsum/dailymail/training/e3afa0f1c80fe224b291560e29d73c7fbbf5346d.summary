the @entity1 administration urged the @entity2 on thursday to overturn @entity4 ’s same - sex marriage ban in a historic act that would affect several other states that offer benefits to gay and lesbian couples			1
the administration ’s friend - of - the - court brief today was notable as it marked the first time any @entity14 president spurred the high court to expand the rights of gays and lesbians to marry			1
the ban , otherwise known as @entity20 , prohibits same - sex couples from marrying and was approved by voters in @entity4 in 2008 ; the case is set to be argued on march 26			1
showing support : the @entity1 administration has asked the @entity2 thursday to over turn @entity20 , a 2008 law that banned gay marriage @entity4 is one of eight states that give same - sex couples the legal benefits of marriage through civil unions and domestic partnerships			1
the other states are : @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , and @entity41			0
none of these states , however , allow gay couples to marry			0
the administration suggested that it is unconstitutional to block these couples from wedding , in direct opposition of the 1996 @entity49 ( @entity49 ) , which defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman			0
the administration wrote : ' they establish homes and lives together , support each other financially , share the joys and burdens of raising children , and provide care through illness and comfort at the moment of death			0
’ mr @entity1 's position , if adopted by the court , would likely result in gay marriage becoming legal in the seven other states			1
the president was publically against gay marriage in his first term , famously saying that his views were ‘ evolving , ’ and also became the first president to openly support the institution			2
he told @entity75 ’ @entity76 in an interview last may that he continues to believe ‘ this is an issue that is going to be worked out at the local level , because historically , this has not been a federal issue , what ’s recognized as a marriage			0
’ point of contention : protestors of @entity20 pictured in @entity88 in 2008 ; its supporters say that the law is discriminatory moment of change : the @entity2 justices will begin hearing arguments on march 26 ; the ruling is due at the end of june mr @entity1 , who himself is a former constitutional law professor , signed off on the administration 's legal argument last week following lengthy discussions with attorney general @entity101 and solicitor general @entity102			1
in a statement following the filing , mr @entity101 said ' the government seeks to vindicate the defining constitutional ideal of equal treatment under the law			0
' friend - of - the - court briefs are not legally binding			1
but the government 's opinion in particular could carry some weight with the justices when they hear oral arguments in the case on march 26			2
despite the potentially wide - ranging implications of the administration 's brief , it still falls short of what gay rights advocates and the attorneys who will argue against @entity20 had hoped for			2
those parties had pressed the president to urge the @entity2 to not only overturn @entity4 's ban , but also declare all gay marriage bans unconstitutional			1
upholding the @entity127 : attorney general @entity101 said in a statement ' the government seeks to vindicate the defining constitutional ideal of equal treatment under the law ' still , marriage equality advocates publicly welcomed the president 's legal positioning			0
' president @entity1 and the solicitor general have taken another historic step forward consistent with the great civil rights battles of our nation 's history , ' said @entity142 , president of the @entity143 and co-founder of the @entity145 , which brought the legal challenge to @entity20			2
the president raised expectations that he would back a broad brief during his inauguration address on january 21			0
he said the nation 's journey ' is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law			0
' benefits : eight states allow same - sex marriage , while 30 have banned it ; states like @entity4 have a constitutional ban on marriage , but allow civil unions and domestic partnerships ' for if we are truly created equal , than surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well , ' he added			1
a @entity170 found that @entity4 voters now favor same - sex marriage in a near two - to - one margin , the highest level of support @entity176 marriage has ever had in the state			1
as @entity179 notes , the findings signify a paradigm shift in voters , who in 2008 voted to approve prop 8			0
those who still did not favor gay marriage tended to be voters who were 65 or older , with 48 percent against			2
@entity184 and @entity179 contributed to this report .			0
