by @entity0 published : 17:32 est , 8 december 2012 updated : 17:33 est , 8 december 2012 it was an @entity2 - sized clanger as sir @entity3 missed his cue into @entity5 at the @entity6 of the @entity7 in front of a 60,000 crowd and a billion - strong tv audience			1
now the @entity11 has explained why it happened – blaming his mistake on reverberations from the giant @entity16 bell			2
sir @entity3 , 70 , performed at the finale of film - maker @entity20 ’s £ 27 million @entity19 spectacular , moments after cyclist @entity21 sounded the 23 - ton bell to formally start the @entity7			1
' embarrassed ' : sir @entity3 missed his cue to start singing @entity5 during the @entity6 after getting distracted by the ringing of a huge bell over his head , pictured right , to mark the start of the games ' @entity28 ' : opinions were mixed over the former @entity31 's performance of the classic song @entity5 during the opening ceremony of the @entity34 @entity3 admitted : ‘ i f * * * * * up			1
i was supposed to wait for a cue			1
but i forgot.why ? well there ’s this bloody great bell that we did n’t know about			1
’ in an interview with music magazine @entity41 , sir @entity3 – who was singing live but accompanied by a prerecorded backing track – spoke of his embarrassment over the gaffe at the end of the four - hour show			1
he had recorded his voice with the backing music before they went on			0
the idea was that when they went live , he would sing over it , with the effect that his voice would then come across twice as strong and reach round the whole stadium			0
for whom the bell tolls : @entity59 cyclist @entity21 ringing the 23 - ton bell to officially mark the start of the @entity16 in @entity62 but with the bell chiming , sir @entity3 missed his cue and began singing late , creating a two - bar delay between his voice and the backing track			1
he explained : ‘ we prerecorded a playback in case all hell broke loose , but i said , “ we wan na do it live			0
” ‘ we were live , everyone was there , the world was ready and this bloody great bell goes off			0
and i forget i ’ve got ta wait for it , so i go “ @entity5			0
” , and someone presses the playback			0
‘ so there ’s me on the backing track , and actual me ; two of us singing			2
’ it seems sir @entity3 is still a little confused – as a video of the performance shows that he did indeed start singing after the backing track			1
he added : ‘ the drummer would n’t look at me because he was in hysterics and i was thinking , “ what have i done ? ” ‘ there was no stopping , it was the @entity16			0
’ afterwards , millions took to @entity90 and website forums to comment on the glitch , some calling for the 70 - year - old pop legend to hang up his microphone			1
one wrote : ‘ to see a colossus laid low by his failing powers is the stuff of @entity101 tragedy – but it ’s doubly tragic that it should happen in front of a worldwide audience			2
’ others described the performance as ‘ cringe - inducing ’ , with another adding : ‘ @entity28 to @entity108			2
’ ironically , the mistake came just weeks after sir @entity3 joked in an interview about the prospect of making just such a high - profile gaffe			1
he said : ‘ generally i do n’t [ get nervous ]			0
but having said that , you never quite know			0
‘ you can do something such as the jubilee or the @entity16 and get the old collywobbles			0
‘ oh @entity118 , that ’d be good , would n’t it ? make a mistake at the @entity16 ! ’ last month it emerged that the @entity16 bell , which was cast in @entity123 , had been dumped in a storage area in @entity62 ’s @entity125			2
@entity16 organisers @entity126 had promised it would remain at the @entity16 site for 200 years after the @entity7			0
it is due to be returned to the site imminently			0
the show must go on : but @entity3 , center , continued to sing @entity5 , which is often voted one of the best pop songs of all time after selling more than eight million copies not on cue : sir @entity3 said he missed his cue because of the bell tolling bringing the show to a close : @entity3 's performance came at the end of @entity20 's £ 27million @entity142			1

sir @entity3 , 70 , performed the classic hit at the finale of film - maker @entity20 ’s £ 27 million @entity142
@entity148 says he forgot his cue after being ' deafened ' by the @entity149
