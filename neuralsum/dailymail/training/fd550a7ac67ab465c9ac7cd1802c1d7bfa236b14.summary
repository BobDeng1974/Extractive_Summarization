by @entity0 published : 11:02 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 17:44 est , 17 october 2012 symptoms such as irritability are often unfairly blamed on a woman 's period , say @entity6 researchers @entity8 syndrome in women has been over-estimated and may not be the cause of women ’s bad moods at certain times of the month			1
that ’s the controversial suggestion by @entity6 researchers , who have suggested that symptoms such as irritability are often unfairly blamed on a woman ’s period when other factors such as stress or a lack of support may be to blame			1
in a new study published in the journal @entity25 , researchers at the @entity22 assessed a wealth of research relating to premenstrual syndrome ( @entity8 )			1
they concluded it ‘ failed to provide clear evidence in support of the existence of a specific premenstrual negative mood syndrome ’			1
the problem is we tend to dismissively blame everything on @entity8 , disregarding other reasons why women may be angry or upset			0
‘ the idea that any emotionality in women can be firstly attributed to their reproductive function - we 're sceptical about that , ’ lead researcher dr @entity39 told the @entity40			0
‘ i think most would assume that @entity8 is much more firmly evidence - based than in fact it is			2
’ dr @entity47 and her colleagues assessed more than 40 studies relating to @entity8			0
while many found some association with mood at various times of a woman ’s cycle , there was no clear pattern as to which part of the cycle was affected and sometimes no relationship at all			1
while there is a link between low mood at various times of a woman 's cycle , there was no clear pattern as to which part of the cycle was affected thirty - sex per cent found no association between mood and the menstrual cycle			1
another 42 per cent ‘ found an association of negative mood in the premenstrual phase , combined with another phase of the menstrual cycle			2
’ only 13 per cent found an association between negative mood and the premenstrual phase			2
this suggests that hormonal fluctuations related to the menstrual cycle are n't necessarily to blame			0
and ‘ when there is a menstrual cycle tie - up it 's actually perimenstrual -- the premenstrual ( 3 - 5 days before menstruation ) and the menstrual phases together -- not purely premenstrual			0
she continued : ‘ i think this can be seen as the modern day equivalent of the old wandering womb notion – that women are hysterical because of their reproductive system			0
' and when a woman 's upset , it 's still often one of the first thoughts people have - maybe she 's premenstrual , rather than ' is her physical health bad ? is she under a lot of stress ? is she lacking social support ? ' " negative moods have long been associated with the menstrual cycle , with references to the issue found in medical literature as far back as the 1930s .			0

symptoms such as irritability are often unfairly blamed on a woman ’s period , say @entity6 researchers
no strong evidence to suggest hormone fluctuations are *responsible* for low mood
