by @entity0 a furious family are desperate to move out of their dream home - after the trees at the end of their garden got torn down to make way for a brand - new prison block for dangerous criminals			1
@entity14 , his wife @entity11 and their four - year - old daughter @entity12 were thrilled to move in to their £ 190,000 semi-detached home in @entity18 , @entity19			1
although they knew the notorious @entity22 was near to their estate , they were protected from it by a large fence and dense trees , and hoped the property would be their ' forever home '			2
looming : @entity22 , soon to be home to 1,500 dangerous prisoners , can now be seen clearly from the back of the @entity35 ' house before : the prison used to be concealed from view by a dense row of trees but not long after mr @entity14 , 35 and mrs @entity40 , 37 , had bought the property in 2011 , the prison was granted planning permission for a massive expansion to allow it to hold an extra 300 inmates			1
the building work saw the shield of trees torn up , leaving their home in full view of what will be the prison 's gatehouse and visitors ' centre			1
once complete the category b prison - which has housed paedophile singer @entity57 - will be able to accommodate 1,500 category b prisoners once the extension is complete			2
the family is so concerned by the development that they have moved their daughter 's bedroom to the front of the house			1
' forever house : @entity14 , 37 , saved for 12 years to afford the property in @entity18 , @entity19 before : the prison used to be invisible , but now there will be a direct line of sight to the house mr @entity14 , a retail manager , said : ' this was meant to be our perfect house - but now we feel like the prisoners because we ’ve lost our privacy			1
' the trees have been ripped out and every window at the back of my house overlooks a building site			2
' it will be the gatehouse and visitor centre for a prison that houses some extremely dangerous men			2
' it was the privacy of the house that appealed to us			0
we knew the prison was some way in the distance - you could only see the lights sometimes at night through the trees			1
' it has devalued our property by tens of thousands of pounds '			0
view : the nearby prison is visible even from the fenced - off garden despite paying a solicitor to check the area for them before buying , @entity14 and mrs @entity40 were not told about the prison plans			1
an application had first been submitted in 2010 , but did not get formally approved until january 2013 , so was not picked up			0
mr @entity14 said : ' i saved up for 12 years to buy this house and i wanted it to be our forever home			2
' we made the neccessary checks on the land behind our house and were assured everything came back clear			0
now i am left with a house that has dramatically reduced in value			0
' my neighbour just sold for £ 169,000			0
a huge reduction from the same houses at the other end of the street which are selling for £ 200,000			0
it ’s put my family under huge strain , financially and emotionally '			0
in light of the surprise development , @entity128 , who sold the property to the @entity40 family , has offered them the chance to move into a different home on their estate			1
@entity137 , chairman of @entity138 , confirmed the family had been given the chance to move into another new home on their estate			0
he said : ' we are aware of the concerns of mr @entity14 at our site and have offered the couple the chance to buy an alternate home			2
the prison facility has been there a long time before the homes were			0
' we understand the couple are unhappy with the view now that the expansion work is ongoing			0
but we can not guarantee anyone a view that is affected by building work on land we do not own ' .			1

@entity14 and @entity40 bought their home in @entity18 , @entity19 , in 2011
they knew it was near category - @entity165 , but it was out of sight
but soon after the sale , prison won planning permission to expand
building work began on new 300 - inmate block , *tearing* down row of trees
the prison 's gatehouse and visitors ' centre is now in full view of the house
@entity40 family say they would never have bought the house had they known
they have moved their four - year - old daughter 's bedroom to shield her
