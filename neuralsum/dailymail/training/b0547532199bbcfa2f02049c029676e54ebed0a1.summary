a mass grave found in @entity2 contains the bodies of an elite ‘ hit squad ’ of invading @entity6 warriors , experts claim			1
all decapitated and buried alongside their severed heads , the 54 skeletons were discovered in 2009 by workmen digging a road			1
archaeologists dated their bones to around the year 1,000 but had few other clues as to the identities of the men who met such a sticky end			1
@entity18 : the bodies were found by workmen digging a new road and were thought to have been killed during the reign of @entity23 who ruled from 968 to 1016 these men , barely into their twenties , were ambushed by the local @entity28 villagers			1
their remains were discovered in 2009 now a researcher at @entity31 claims to have pieced the story together in a documentary to be screened tonight			1
dr @entity35 ’s research suggests they were a fearsome brotherhood of killers who had a strict military code – never to show fear , and never to flee in the face of an enemy unless totally outnumbered			2
they either were , or modelled themselves on , the @entity46 – a hit squad founded by @entity48 , the @entity49 king who died around 970 who masterminded a stream of vicious raids on the south coast of @entity53			2
named after their stronghold at @entity58 on the @entity60 coast , their history is shrouded in myth but at a time the @entity63 were feared across @entity64 , they were regarded as the most terrifying of all			2
but on this occasion , the men , barely into their twenties , were ambushed by the local @entity28 villagers			2
piecing it together : researcher dr @entity35 claims to have finally solved the riddle of why 54 decapitated @entity6 bodies were found in a mass grave in @entity2 in 2009 stripped and humiliated , they were rounded up and axes and swords brought down on their necks , before their remains were tossed into a ditch			1
dr @entity35 believes the murders , at @entity79 in @entity2 , probably took place during the reign of @entity23 who ruled from 968 to 1016			1
a chronicle , commissioned by his second wife , @entity82 notes there was a group of @entity6 killers in @entity53 at the time , led by a fearsome warrior called @entity90 the @entity91 , said to be a @entity46			2
research : dr @entity35 says that a chronicle shows that a group of @entity6 killers were in @entity53 at the exact time of the massacre took place dr @entity35 said : ‘ @entity82 ’s record connects @entity46 to @entity53 at exactly this time			0
‘ clearly these men had shown a level of bravery similar to the @entity46 code			1
so while we can not be certain about who they were , there are a number of tie - ins that take us down that route			0
‘ the legends and stories of the @entity46 travelled around the medieval world and would almost certainly have been indicative of some of the practices of other bands of mercenaries or may even have been imitated by other groups			0
’ aethelred the @entity23 was tormented by @entity63 and ordered all @entity119 men living in @entity53 to be killed on the november 13 , 1002 - @entity120 - which became known as the @entity121			0
remains have been found in @entity123 and it is thought that massacres also took place in @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 but the remains found here are unique			0
unlike the frenzied mob attack that took place at @entity123 , all these men were murdered methodically and beheaded in an unusual fashion from the front			0
this is actually mentioned in @entity46 legend which states : ‘ i am content to die as are all our comrades			0
but i will not let myself be slaughtered like a sheep			0
i would rather face the blow			0
strike straight at my face and watch carefully if i pale at all			0
’ it was discovered last year that the skeletons had stripes filed into their teeth , suggesting this was a way they demonstrated their bravery .			1

54 skeletons were discovered decapitated and buried alongside their severed heads
the discovery of the mass grave in @entity2 will feature in @entity159 , which is being shown on @entity161 @entity160 at *9pm* tonight .
