men feel less attractive if their wife or girlfriend takes the oral contraceptive , a study claims			1
@entity20 and @entity21 researchers studied 14 women who were on the @entity12 , then stopped taking it			2
they were asked how attractive they felt – and their partners were asked how they saw them			0
the men were also asked how they rated their own looks			0
the team found being on the @entity12 made no difference to how a woman saw herself			2
however , the men felt more attracted to women when they were not on the @entity12 , which is taken by three million @entity20			1
the researchers say this could be because the treatment stops hormonal fluctuations that make a woman particularly fertile at certain times in a monthly cycle			0
at these times , said @entity40 , of @entity41 , women display subtle cues , such as clear skin and flirty behaviour , that men respond to subconsciously by feeling attracted to them			0
so why did a partner on the @entity12 make men feel less attractive ? the scientists said men ’s sense of their own appeal is based on their partner ’s looks			1
differing perspectives : alternatively , being on the @entity12 makes no difference to how a woman sees herself when women are off the @entity12 , men are more attracted to them			1
as a result , they get an ego boost that makes them feel good about themselves , they suggest			0
in the journal @entity65 , dr @entity40 said the results should not affect use of the @entity12 , but said ‘ subtle psychological effects ’ may have been overlooked .			0
