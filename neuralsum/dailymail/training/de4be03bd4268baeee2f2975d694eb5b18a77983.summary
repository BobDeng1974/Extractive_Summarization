@entity3 inspector @entity38 said : ‘ this is an horrific case			2
inflicting violence on any animal is completely unacceptable			0
it was an appalling , callous and cruel act			0
‘ this young rabbit would have been powerless to do anything to protect itself and she was then left untreated for weeks before she was found			2
' doing this job , i have seen some horrendous consequences of cruelty and neglect - but this one will stick in my mind for a long time to come			2
‘ my heart sinks when i think about the immense suffering this rabbit will have endured at the hands of her owner - the very person who was meant to care for her			0
’ the second rabbit was found emaciated and immobile inside a cardboard box covered with a plastic carrier bag after they were called to the flat after a dispute with his partner in february			0

however , a vet concluded the rabbit must have been forcefully thrown to inflict the injuries			0
mr @entity76 said : ‘ the vet said he was horrified by the degree of suffering this animal endured , especially considering the owner had inflicted the injuries and did n’t make any attempt to alleviate the suffering			0
