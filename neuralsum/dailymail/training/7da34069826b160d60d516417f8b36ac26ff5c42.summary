who was this @entity37 , whose name was etched on her husband ’s grave marker ? ‘ i gasped and said who is this , ’ @entity18 said , choking up			1
‘ i thought this woman was in this grave with him as i want to be			0
’ fearing the worst for an entire weekend , @entity18 waited for the cemetery office to open that monday			2
mysterious : air force sergeant @entity18 was a devoted husband and father , said @entity12 , and he died 25 years ago			1

but a mistake was obviously made			0
