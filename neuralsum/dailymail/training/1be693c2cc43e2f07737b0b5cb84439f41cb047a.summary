by @entity0 published : 00:58 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 09:23 est , 7 october 2013 the government shut - down is having an unforeseen effect on @entity4 player @entity3 , who announced via @entity5 last week that he 's legally changing his surname to @entity3 following what he says are unfair @entity4 fines for illegal hits			1
@entity3 , a safety for the @entity11 , wants his @entity13 football jersey to read ' @entity3 ' for his next game - but he 's going to wait , since the shutdown means his name - change wo n't be processed for at least a month			1
@entity3 's vowed to legally change his name to @entity3 after the @entity4 fined him $ 21,00 for an illegal hit on a @entity20 player earlier this season			1
shut down : @entity3 will remain a @entity3 until at least november his plans to drop the @entity23 from his last name were scuppered by @entity4 officials , who require a player to legally change his moniker before wearing a jersey emblazoned with it			2
the name - change could prove costly , too : according to @entity30 , @entity13 requires a player to buy up any remaining inventory featuring the old name			2
that means @entity35 , as @entity3 , would have to buy all the unsold jerseys with his name on them before the company would begin producing new @entity41 versions			0
but according to the @entity43 , the cost might not deter @entity3 - he 's due to earn $ 3.8 million this year			2
protest : 49ers player @entity3 ( 31 ) is changing his name for what he says was an unfair $ 21,000 fine for an illegal tackle the would - be @entity3 took to @entity5 yesterday to vent his frustration : ' damn gov't shutdown lol @entity48 , ' he wrote			1
by the estimation of @entity50 , the soonest @entity3 could be on - field in a @entity3 jersey is the november 17 game against the @entity53			0
but it could be a lot longer : @entity55 had to wait a year to put ' @entity55 ' on the back of his jersey , due to contractual obligations with @entity59			0
@entity60 sure : @entity3 ( left ) is determined that his @entity13 football jersey will read @entity3 instead of @entity3 the @entity63 native seems to be taking the setback in - stride , and maintains the name - change will go ahead : ' if you ask the fans around @entity69 , the @entity70 , or anyone that 's a fan of me , they call me @entity3 any way , ' he told 49ers.com			1
' everything we do is for the fans right ? it 's all entertainment			0
it 's entertainment , but that 's what i do , it 's my game			0
along with some things that happened recently , that 's why i went with it			0

@entity3 , safety for the @entity11 , wanted to be @entity3 for *sunday* 's game
due to the government shut - down , his name - change *paperwork* is going to take longer than he expected
@entity3 's name - change is a protest over what he says was an unfair $ 21,000 fine for illegal tackling
