it ’s my favourite day of the year			2
@entity3 is looming – so let the fun begin on @entity5			2
for sports news operations , it is a chance to flex your muscles , show your medals , break the stories of the latest deals and then publish them as fast as is possible			2
in our office , the day starts at around 6am and finishes at midnight			0
it ’s an adrenalin rush of breaking news and revealing detail ( and hoping it ’s @entity19 , @entity20 or @entity21 signing someone in a desperate late dash and not just relying on @entity24 or @entity25 taking a left back on loan … please )			1
the best of television sport , the best of radio sport and the most complete sports service on the internet			0
actors are often told to avoid working with animals and to avoid walking down steps in live shows			0
add @entity55 reporters working with a bunch of screaming kids outside a training ground , where you know one of them has been dared by their mates to see how rude their gesture can be			0
like @entity5 's reporters hitting their phones , the tv reporters are desperate for that news nugget that will illuminate the coverage and leave rivals floundering for confirmation			1
we ’ll deliver this time			0
here are the links to the big stories we broke this time last year when @entity44 went to @entity20 ( by @entity85 ) and @entity43 to @entity19 ( by @entity86 )			1
soon ‘ @entity88 ’ were reporting the same news			2
our reporters know they have to deliver information as quickly as possible for you , our readers			0
will it be @entity96 ? @entity98 , or even @entity99 ( surely someone has to take him ? )			1
will @entity20 sign a striker ? where will @entity101 be at the end of the day ? how many players will @entity104 be linked with ? what about that unpronounceable @entity108 winger who might be arriving in the back of a car under a cover in a @entity113 - like smuggling act ? it ’s @entity115 on @entity3 ( or @entity116 on @entity117 in the modern age of abbreviating everything ) … first for stories			1
and a chance to see it unfold without having to listen to @entity123			0
what more can you football fans ask for ? @entity127 : @entity129 host and @entity33 hero @entity130 ( left with his @entity131 from @entity132 86 ) meets @entity133 in @entity37 before the @entity135 carnival earlier this summer three to watch : @entity136 boss @entity104 interviewed through his car window outside the club 's training ground ( again , left ) , @entity96 ( centre ) and @entity141 keeper @entity101 ( right ) flawed genius : @entity133 interviews @entity33 legend @entity144 in 2009 for a feature in the @entity146			1

@entity44 to @entity20 was first revealed on @entity115 last year
@entity19 's capture of @entity43 also broken by @entity27
