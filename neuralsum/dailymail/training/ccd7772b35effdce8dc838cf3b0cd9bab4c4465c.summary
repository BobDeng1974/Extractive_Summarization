a former bookmaker and party - loving mother - of - three looks set to claim the title of @entity4 after becoming a @entity6 bodybuilding champion in her first ever competition			1
@entity8 , 31 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , stunned judges and fellow competitors at last weekend 's @entity13 at the @entity14 ... a mere 18 months after first hitting the gym with intent			1
@entity8 - who has six - year - old twin girls @entity18 and @entity19 and a son called @entity21 , 12 - was the only debutant in the contest , and following her success is now setting her sights on the @entity4 competition to be held in @entity14 in november			1
@entity8 was the only debutant in the competition in @entity14 , and her win gave her a taste for success , leaving her determined to win the @entity4 title in november just 18 months ago @entity8 used to be a real ' party girl ' , always choosing a night out drinking with friends over a trip to the gym rising at 6am each morning , eating a diet of nothing but fish for five weeks and enduring arduous training sessions in the gym were all key to the success of the 31 - year - old who has transformed herself from party girl to ' supermum '			1
@entity8 said : ' i still ca n't believe that i 'm a @entity6 bodybuilding champion			2
i was the only debutant at the event and all the others were stunned ... but none more than me			2
until 18 months ago i 'd class myself as a bit of a party girl ! ' @entity8 's partner , @entity52 runs a gym and nutritional supplements business , but she 'd always stayed away from the gym in the past , preferring a night out to a training session			1
she said : ' @entity52 never encouraged me to get into the gym			2
i just started training and when i saw the changes in my body i knew that i wanted to do something with it			0
i love training and the adrenaline hit it brings			0
' @entity8 , pictured performing in @entity14 , says her partner @entity52 runs a gym and nutritional supplements business , but she 'd always stayed away from the gym in the past , preferring a night out @entity8 swapped pints of lager for gym sessions , and now works with her partner @entity52 at his nutritional supplement business @entity8 , a former bookmaker with @entity74 at branches throughout @entity9 , has now teamed up with @entity52 at his business , @entity77 , at @entity78 , @entity79			1
her remarkable win at sunday 's @entity81 has seen her qualify automatically for the body building world championships in @entity83 later this year			2
but she is uncertain she will go as she already struggles with a packed schedule of training , work and fulfilling her role as mother to three young children			0
so instead she is focusing on the @entity4 contest back in @entity14 in november			1
along with @entity8 's own children , @entity52 ' 11 - year - old son @entity91 completes the family			1
rising at 6am each morning , eating a diet of nothing but fish for five weeks and enduring arduous training sessions in the gym were all key to the success of the 31 - year - old ' supermum ' @entity8 , posing with her trainer in @entity14 , left , says her children call her ' fit mum ' now , and her twin daughters @entity18 and @entity19 pose with her in front of the mirror she said : ' it has been hard fitting the training in at times , but i 'm usually up and away at 6am for an hour - long cardio session and i 'm back before they even get up so that i can get them ready for school			1
' they 've all been really supportive			0
they call me " fit mum " now and the twins come and pose with me in the mirror			0
' @entity8 trains four days a week and takes classes at @entity52 's gym , hoping that she can inspire others to get fit			1
her regime changes depending on her proximity to a competition , as does her diet			0
for the past weeks , she has eaten nothing but fish and has only now been able to re-introduce other food into her meals			0
@entity8 before she started training , left , and now , right , having swapped pints and nights out for gym sessions four times a week a relieved @entity8 admitted : ' it 's nice to have potatoes and things again			2
the appeal of a fish breakfast soon wears off			0
' proud partner @entity52 , who trained @entity8 to victory despite having no experience of bodybuilding competition , said : ' i 'm really proud of what she 's achieved			1
' when we first met she was a party girl and she really only got into training about 18 months ago			0
