by @entity0 published : 18:32 est , 5 january 2014 updated : 05:37 est , 6 january 2014 potential cure : consuming only salad , weight loss shakes and non-starchy vegetables for eight weeks could reverse diabetes , a study has found a crash diet that has been medically approved could help millions of @entity9 defeat diabetes			1
men and women suffering from the disease were able to throw away their tablets after going on an extreme low - calorie diet for just two months			1
and 18 months later , some were still free of symptoms and said they were astonished at the dramatic improvement in their health			1
so far the diet has only been tested on a handful of patients			2
but a £ 2.4million trial involving 280 diabetics is about to get under way			0
these men and women will live on meal replacement shakes and soups			0
they will be allowed to take in only 800 calories a day – an amount many people will consume in their lunch			0
type 2 diabetes , which normally develops in middle age , is the most common form of the condition with 3million sufferers in the @entity9 alone			1
the disease occurs when the pancreas does not make enough insulin and the insulin that is made does not work properly			0
@entity44 ’s professor @entity43 believes fat surrounding vital organs could be the key to understanding the condition			0
this fat is thought to clog up the pancreas and liver , cutting insulin production and stopping insulin from being used properly			0
but crash dieting plunges the body into starvation mode , the fat is burned off and the vital organs are then freed up			2
the original trial – involving 11 men and women – found consuming only weight loss shakes , salad and non-starchy vegetables for eight weeks could reverse diabetes			1
fat levels in the pancreas returned to normal and the organ was able to pump out insulin without running into any problems			0
and three months after the end of the diet , seven out of the 11 participants were still diabetes - free			1
even 18 months later , at least four of the patients found that they had no signs of diabetes			1
@entity76 , 69 , of @entity77 in @entity78 , came off his diabetes tablets after taking part in the trial			2
he said : ‘ it ’s astonishing really that a diet – hard as it was – could change my health so drastically			2
’ disease : type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the condition with 3million sufferers in the @entity9 alone and professor @entity43 said : ‘ i believe that this study will lead to a quantum leap forward in our understanding of how best to manage type 2 diabetes			1
’ the new , much larger trial , which will be co-led by @entity97 researcher @entity96 , will see if the success can be repeated in large numbers of people			0
it will look at how easy they find it to follow the diet – and see how long they remain healthy after they have started to eat normally again			0
professor @entity96 said : ‘ if our analysis shows this approach is both effective and cost - effective , our aim would be to produce a programme that could be implemented in the @entity112 as soon as possible			0
’ and dr @entity113 from @entity114 , which is funding the trial , said : ‘ type 2 diabetes will always be a serious condition			1
‘ but perhaps it wo n’t always be seen as a condition that people have to manage for the rest of their lives and one that worsens inevitably over time			0
‘ if we can do this safely , on a bigger scale as part of routine care , then a low - calorie liquid diet would be a real game changer in terms of reducing people ’s risk of devastating health complications such as amputation and blindness			1
’ however the research has no implications for people with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancreas is damaged by the body ’s own immune system			2
and the charity has advised people not to embark on the diet themselves , strongly urging anyone determined to try it to speak to their gp first .			2

extreme low - calorie diet could help millions of @entity9 defeat diabetes
patients ate only weight loss shakes , salad and non-starchy vegetables
they were able to come off tablets after crash dieting for two months
some were still free of symptoms 18 months later , with improved health
type 2 diabetes *affects* around 3million people in the @entity9 alone
