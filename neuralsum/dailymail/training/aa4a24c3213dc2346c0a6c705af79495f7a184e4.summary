the world ’s largest safety inquiry into @entity3 crops and linked pesticides has been announced			1
the $ 25million - £ 15.6m - project will involve feeding trials with 6,000 rats at laboratories in @entity9 and @entity10			1
the research , which is being run under the banner of @entity13 , involves a collaboration between @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity10 scientists			1
it is being organised by the @entity19 , which describes itself as a non-governmental , non-profit organisation , and will be overseen by a board of neutral scientists			0
the largest safety inquiry into @entity3 crops and linked pesticides is to held , using 6,000 rats to test the products to date , most of the safety research on @entity3 crops and farming systems has been conducted or funded by the biotech companies , such as @entity33 , or critics of the technology			1
@entity13 says its research will be independent of vested interests and will finally give an answer to questions about the safety of @entity3 crops and the associated weedkiller glyphosate			1
some rat feeding trials have linked the two to an increased risk of cancer , however these have been dismissed by the industry and the @entity47			1
most @entity3 crops , such as soya and maize , have been genetically engineered to withstand spraying with glyphosate , which is the active ingredient in the weedkiller sold as the brand roundup			1
this allows farmers ’ fields to be blanket sprayed with the chemical , which kills off the weeds but allows the crops to thrive			0
the scientific review board overseeing the research includes dr @entity63 , the professor of @entity64 and @entity65 in the @entity66 at the @entity67			0
he said : ‘ the @entity13 study has the potential to provide invaluable information on the health effects of a commercialised , herbicide - resistant @entity3 food and its associated herbicide			2
‘ the cultivation of herbicide resistant crops is widespread in the @entity17 , and the use of the herbicides to which these crops are resistant has increased many-fold in the decades since they were introduced			2
‘ there is a notable lack of published , peer - reviewed data on their safety , as well as data on the safety of the increased use of herbicides with which they are grown			0
the @entity13 study could be very useful in reducing the uncertainty about the safety of these products			2
’ @entity93 of @entity13 said : ‘ food is the main source of energy for all living beings , and its safety is the key to their health and well - being , as well as to sustainable development			2
in order to prevent irreversible consequences , humankind must ensure the total safety of @entity3 crops and their associated pesticides before they are planted even more widely			1
’ it is hoped the study will answer questions about how safe @entity3 crops and linked pesticides are for humans she said : ‘ comprehensive scientific safety studies on @entity3 organisms and their related pesticides are long overdue			1
‘ all previous studies caused controversy for various reasons : choice of animal , insufficient statistics , duration of tests , research parameters , and researchers ’ connections to the @entity132 movement or the biotech industry			1
‘ @entity13 is intended to remedy the situation			0
the project organisers have considered all of the points of disagreement and distrust surrounding this subject			0
factor gmo has in its arsenal a scientific protocol drawn up with all the necessary standards , an international scientific team of leading professionals with a neutral background , independent funding , and perhaps most importantly , full transparency			0
’ dr @entity150 , who works in @entity10 ’s @entity151 and @entity152 and will sit of the governing board , said most rat feeding trials with @entity3 food have been limited to 90 days and looked at two generations			1
this project will follow five generations of rats as part of a comprehensive study lasting two to three years			2
it will look at any changes to cancer rates or any birth abnormalities			0
@entity93 is part of @entity13 and said the study was long overdue and will be transparent , with independent scientists on board she said : ‘ there has never been comprehensive research investigating the effects of a @entity3 food on reproductive function			1
’ dr @entity175 , who is director and chief of pathology of the @entity178 of the @entity179 , in @entity180 , @entity181 , said : ‘ the concern over @entity3 crops is largely due to the fact that plant breeders can construct synthetic dna sequences and insert these into crop genomes , effectively adding new traits to the plant			1
‘ this raises enormous possibilities for developing benign products , but equally it has the potential to create products with unwanted traits and side - effects			0
‘ the long - term study design will reveal any effects that take time to show up			0
it could provide the detailed data needed for a scientific evidenced - based risk assessment of possible human health hazards from the @entity3 crop and its associated pesticide			2
’ funding for the research is to come from private donors , rather than the industry or campaigners			0
a list will be published			0
biotech companies insist that many studies have already proved that @entity3 crops and food and safe			1
dr @entity215 , chairman of the industry ’s @entity216 , said : ‘ the plant biotechnology industry takes product safety regarding biotech food and feed very seriously and is committed to the highest standards of testing for its products			0
‘ the @entity13 study is far from the biggest ever study on the safety of @entity3 , despite claims from its sponsors			2
‘ it falls a long way short of the @entity232 ’s report in 2011 when they released research from over 130 research projects , involving 500 independent research groups , over the period of 25 years , at a cost of € 300m , which concluded that ‘ there is , as of today , no scientific evidence associating gmos with higher risks for the environment or for food and feed safety than conventional plants and organisms			0

the £ 15.6m project will involve using 6,000 rats to test safety of @entity3 crops
scientists from @entity9 , @entity17 and @entity10 will work on @entity13
it has been called the largest inquiry into @entity3 crops and linked pesticides
project will involve tests on five generations of rats over two or three years
*experts* hope it will give an answer about how safe @entity3 crops are to eat
previous studies found increased risk of cancer in rats *undergoing* tests
