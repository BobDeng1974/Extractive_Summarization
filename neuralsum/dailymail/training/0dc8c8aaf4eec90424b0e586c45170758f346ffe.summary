by mail online reporter @entity1 from @entity2 was frozen in suspended animation for transport , but now scientists hope to perform surgery by ' freezing ' patients it sounds like something out of @entity2 - doctors are to attempt to save the lives of ten patients by putting them in ‘ suspended animation ’ , when they are neither alive or dead			1
medics in the @entity16 will use the futuristic - sounding technique to buy themselves time to save knife and gunshot wound victims whose injuries would normally prove fatal			1
surgeons at @entity22 , in @entity23 , will cool down the patients so their blood cells need less oxygen to survive			1
while the body is in this state , the team will work to fix the ' structural problems ' caused by a blade or a bullet			0
the trial will take place later this month and the surgeons are already on call at the hospital , primed for when a suitable patient arrives , @entity33 reports			1
the procedure - which has been likened to what happened to @entity41 in the @entity2 movie - will see all of the patients ’ blood being replaced with cold saline solution , meaning their bodies will quickly cool to @entity47 and almost all cellular activity will stop			1
‘ we are suspending life , but we do n't like to call it suspended animation because it sounds like science fiction , ’ @entity49 , a surgeon at the hospital , told @entity33			1
‘ so we call it emergency preservation and resuscitation			0
’ @entity59 at the @entity60 added : ‘ if a patient comes to us two hours after dying you ca n't bring them back to life			0
' but if they 're dying and you suspend them , you have a chance to bring them back after their structural problems have been fixed			0
' it has long been known that there are benefits to cooling the bodies of some severely injured people			1
when the body is at its normal temperature , cells need a strong supply of oxygen , meaning that if the heart stops beating , the person will die rapidly			0
however , if the body temperature has been reduced , less oxygen is required , buying doctors time to save the patient			2
previously , cooling of a body has been used during some operations but this involves circulating the blood through a cooling system			2
this is not an option in emergency medicine as it takes too long			0
as a result , doctors had to find a method of cooling the body much more quickly			0
in 2002 researchers at the @entity103 tested a new technique on pigs			2
the creatures were sedated and then subjected to massive blood loss before their blood was replaced by cold saline solution			1
once the pigs had been cooled to @entity47 , their injuries were repaired and they were warmed up again			1
a cell in suspended animation			0
doctors face the challenge of freezing human cells without causing damage the saline solution was replaced by their blood			1
the researchers noted that in most of the pigs , the hearts started again naturally and they suffered no long - term ill effects			0
the medics are now ready to try the technique on humans			1
however , they will need the right patient			0
it will have to be someone whose heart has stopped as a result of an injury and who can not be successful revived using traditional techniques			0
their body temperature will be reduced in just 15 minutes , they will temporarily have no blood in their system and they will not be breathing or have any brain activity			2
technically , they will be dead			2
the doctors hope that the patients will then revive naturally but if they do not then they will be resuscitated .			0

@entity16 medics *developing* the technique to buy time in *treating* lethal wounds
patients will be cooled down until they are neither dead or alive
blood will be replaced with saline and bodies cooled to @entity47
the trial will take place later this month at a @entity23 hospital
