by @entity0 published : 04:39 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 07:51 est , 12 march 2014 with prices in excess of Â £ 5000 for breast augmentation , its no surprise that 43 per cent of @entity3 people say they would go abroad in search of cheaper surgery			1
but it does n't always have quite the results expected , as @entity13 , 30 , a call centre worker from @entity14 , knows only too well			1
not only did her quest for cut - price surgery leave her with sagging breasts in two different sizes , it left her with an infection so severe , it continued to rage even after the offending implants had been removed			1
upset : @entity13 was unhappy with her sagging breasts but a botched boob job abroad proved a catastrophe @entity13 's problems began when she dropped three cup sizes after losing weight and found herself unhappy and embarrassed by her newly diminutive assets			1
' i used to go to the gym in padded bras and put sports bras on top of them so people would n't notice the sagging in my breasts , ' she says			0
' the relationship i was in at the time suffered because i would n't remove my bra , even when going to bed at night and when i took my bra off , it did n't feel right because my breasts were sagging like an old woman 's			2
' her solution was implants but with the cost of breast augmentation surgery coming in at Â £ 5,000 or more , she decided to look abroad for a cheaper surgeon			1
' when i looked into having surgery done abroad , i found i could get exactly what i wanted at less cost , ' she explains			0
heartbreaking : @entity13 weeps after being told just how badly damaged her breasts are she contacted a clinic in @entity56 and was initially impressed by both their professionalism and the results of her operation			1
' the company i chose to go with responded to me really quickly and said i would be cared for in a luxury hotel , ' she reveals			0
' they told me about the sights , how it was relaxing , how i could have a bit of a holiday while i was there			0
they 'd give me a 100 per cent guarantee that i 'd be happy			0
' and at first , @entity13 was indeed thrilled with the results of her implant surgery			1
' i was amazed by the results , ' she confesses			0
' they [ the new breasts ] were perfect - exactly what i was looking for			2
they looked great and i thought that was the start of a new me			0
' but her happiness was to prove short lived and just three weeks after returning , the problems began in earnest			0
' the right breast had really started to grow in size and the left breast scar had opened up and had started to look kind of yellowy , ' reveals @entity13			1
miserable : @entity13 's breast surgery happened after she lost lots of weight and dropped three cup sizes damage : the scar beneath her left breast became badly infected leaving her with fat necrosis inside it ' there was a lot of pain and some leakage started coming out			1
over the course of the next couple of days , things just kept getting worse			0
the right breast was huge and it felt so sore , it felt like it was going to burst			0
' she was rushed to hospital where doctors discovered that a pocket of fluid had developed in her right breast , while a severe infection was burning through her left			2
both implants , said medics , would have to be removed			2
for @entity13 , who 'd had to work two jobs to afford the original surgery , it was a severe blow			1
' i could n't stop crying , ' she remembers			0
' everything i 'd worked so hard to get was being taken away from me			0
' worse , not only were her breasts left saggier than before , they were two different sizes with the right far bigger than the left			2
upsetting : @entity13 was left with different - sized breasts and a rampant infection following the bungled surgery ' my breasts looked worse than what they ever did before , ' she adds			1
' i 'm at an age where i should be happy and settling down but it 's taken away the happy bit			0
' since having the implants removed , @entity13 has been to see a cosmetic surgeon in this country , where she was told that due to rotting fat left behind by the implants , a further set would be unwise			1
instead , she was given surgery to even up her breasts and to remove any remaining pockets of infection			1
although disappointed , @entity13 is resigned and says she wo n't be having surgery again			2
' i think it would be for my best interests to be safe and healthy , ' she explains , ' rather than having another implant put in			0
' @entity13 appears on @entity146 , thursday night at 9pm on @entity147			2

@entity13 , 30 , was left with a raging infection after a botched boob job
had surgery on a trip to @entity56 because it was cheaper than in the @entity3
both implants had to be removed - much to @entity13 's *distress*
the call centre worker had taken an extra job to pay for original operation
left with two different sized breasts and a *persistent* infection
