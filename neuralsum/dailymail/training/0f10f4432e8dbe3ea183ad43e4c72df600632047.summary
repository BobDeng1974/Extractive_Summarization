@entity0 has piled the pressure on the growing crisis in @entity4 ’s reputation by calling for an end to hold - ups in a long - delayed report on the @entity8			1
the former prime minister has been accused of trying to delay publication of the @entity11 over well - sourced reports that it will savage his handling of the conflict			1
now mr @entity0 has stepped into the dispute by making it clear sir @entity19 ’s findings should be made public as soon as possible			0
@entity4 , pictured answering questions in 2010 , has been accused of trying to delay publication of the @entity11 it follows claims that mr @entity4 and @entity24 hope to delay the report until after next year ’s general election , arguing any criticism of the last @entity28 could hit @entity30 ’s hopes of success			1
‘ the @entity9 believes there is no excuse for any further lengthy delay in publishing @entity19 , ’ said a no 10 aide			0
‘ it would be unreasonable to postpone it beyond the next election			0
’ the controversy comes as mr @entity4 faces an increasing struggle to retain his standing			1
the @entity44 ’s disclosure of his weekends with @entity47 ’s wife @entity46 – and the role it played in the @entity49 ’ divorce – damaged his personal image			0
his reputation as a statesman and businessman has also come under heavy fire			0
a recent speech , during which he urged @entity57 to set aside its differences with @entity59 to fight radical @entity60 , was dismissed as ‘ embarrassingly simple - minded ’ by some experts			0
it led to some questioning how long he can continue as the @entity65 ’s envoy to the @entity66			0
and an attack on mr @entity4 by his biographer @entity68 , published on friday by the @entity69 , claimed he had built up a £ 100 million fortune since leaving @entity71 in 2007 in his ‘ lust for personal riches and attention ’			1
one of the main bones of contention over the report into the conflict ( pictured ) is private notes between @entity4 and the then @entity81 president @entity80 friends of mr @entity4 fear that with his overall reputation in the balance , public condemnation by @entity84 will be the last straw			1
a former @entity24 ally said : ‘ since leaving @entity71 , @entity4 has managed to remain a big player on the world stage and use it to earn money , justifying it by doing good work at the same time			1
‘ it has served him well , but it is all starting to collapse			0
if @entity19 points the finger of blame squarely at him , which @entity4 himself knows full well it will , the whole edifice could crumble			1
that is why it is in his interest that @entity105 should be delayed for as long as possible			0
’ mr @entity4 has dismissed the inquiry , saying ‘ going back ’ over events will not help @entity57 solve the @entity66 crisis , but he denies blocking it			1
one of the main bones of contention is private notes between him and the then @entity81 president @entity80 , which show the decision to go to war was taken long before mr @entity4 indicated the measure publicly			2
concerns : friends of mr @entity4 fear that with his overall reputation in the balance , public condemnation by @entity84 will be the last straw @entity19 wants to publish the notes and told mr @entity0 last year that it was ‘ regrettable ’ this had not been agreed			2
mr @entity0 said he hoped for a resolution ‘ as soon as possible ’			0
mr @entity4 ’s camp is resisting , arguing it would compromise future prime ministers and presidents			2
there are claims that former barrister mr @entity4 and his advisers are challenging every detail raised by @entity19 and his panel of experts			2
mr @entity0 can expect little support from the current @entity24 leader in bringing forward @entity19			1
even though @entity30 has disowned the @entity8 , strategists fear it will remind voters of the last @entity28 ’s record on @entity137 and cost them votes .			2
