the area you live in can have a huge effect on your education and outlook			0
and now researchers believe people can be made less racist by simply moving to live in ethnically - mixed areas			1
an international study found that white people develop ‘ passive tolerance ’ of minorities in mixed areas , even if they have no direct contact with them			1
a recent international study found that white people develop ' passive tolerance ' of minorities in mixed areas , such as central @entity16 ( pictured ) even if they have no direct contact with them professor @entity18 , director of the @entity19 for the @entity20 , said governments could create more ‘ harmonious neighbourhoods ’ by doing more to encourage different ethnic groups to mix. ‘ if two white people with identical views went to live in different postcodes for a year , the person in the neighbourhood with more mixing between ethnic groups would likely leave more tolerant , ’ he said			1
‘ we would see this effect even if they never personally spoke to people from other ethnicities			2
‘ the size of this “ passive tolerance ” effect on people 's prejudice is of the same order as the effect of passive smoking on lung cancer risk			1
’ the @entity44 - led study , published in the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) journal , is based on seven studies carried out in @entity48 , mainland @entity49 , the @entity50 and @entity51 between 2002 and 2011			1
professor @entity18 , director of the @entity19 for the @entity20 , said governments could create more ' harmonious neighbourhoods ' by doing more to encourage different ethnic groups to mix it found that even highly prejudiced people who did not mix with those of different ethnicities became more tolerant the longer they lived in mixed areas			1
the scientists suggest simply seeing white strangers ‘ interacting positively ’ with ethnic minorities is enough to reduce racial prejudice			1
professor @entity18 , the report 's senior author , said : ‘ astonishingly , we do n't just see reduced prejudice among people who have direct contact with ethnic minorities			2
‘ it is n't even confined to those whose friends have contact with minorities			0
simply living in a neighbourhood where other people are mixing with minorities is enough to reduce racial prejudice			0
’ he added : ‘ governments should do more to encourage different groups to mix with each other , as we now know that this reduces prejudice not just in individuals but throughout entire neighbourhoods			1
‘ @entity85 interventions that aim to increase contact between groups will help to establish more tolerant social norms in society			2
in the long run , this should lead to more harmonious neighbourhoods			2
’ brain scans could soon be used to detect whether or not people are racist , scientists say			2
last year , researchers found that brain scans were able to pick up on differences in the way that people with implicit negative racial attitudes viewed black and white faces			0
racial stereotypes have previously been shown to have subtle and unintended consequences on how we treat members of different race groups			0
but research shows race biases also increase differences in the brain 's representations of faces			0
psychologists @entity114 of the @entity115 in @entity116 and @entity117 and @entity118 of @entity119 examined activity in the brain while participants looked at pictures of @entity124 and black faces			0
by examining patterns of brain activity in the fusiform face area - a brain area involved in face perception - the researchers were able to predict the race of the person that the participant was viewing , but only for those participants with stronger , negative implicit race attitudes			0
this , the researchers said , implies that people with stronger , negative implicit race attitudes may actually perceive black and white faces to look more different than others who held no such prejudice .			0

a study found led by the @entity44 found that white people develop ‘ passive tolerance ’ of minorities in mixed areas
it said even highly prejudiced people who did not mix with those of different ethnicities became more tolerant the longer they lived in mixed areas
scientists said that governments could create more ‘ harmonious neighbourhoods ’ by doing more to encourage different ethnic groups to mix
