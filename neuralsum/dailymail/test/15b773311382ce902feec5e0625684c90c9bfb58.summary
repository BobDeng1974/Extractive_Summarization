a former @entity1 player has revealed that his mother demanded he pay her one million dollars as the cost for ' raising him for the last 18 years ' after he was drafted into the professional league			2
@entity6 was a first - round draft pick for the @entity8 , and seventeenth overall , when his mother made the request in 2002			1
@entity6 , who also played for the @entity14 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 before retiring in 2011 , discussed the incident in his recently released book @entity16 : stay @entity17			0
' if my mother taught me anything , it 's that this is the most desperate demand that a parent can make on a child , ' he wrote in an exclusive excerpt released to @entity26			1
former @entity1 player @entity6 ( pictured here playing for the @entity8 ) has revealed his mother demanded he pay her one million dollars as the cost ' for raising him for the last 18 years ' after he was drafted ' the covenant of having a child is simply that you give your child everything possible , and they owe you nothing beyond a normal amount of love and respect			1
' but after years , @entity6 said he realized that his mother and family members were different - especially when money became involved			1
he told @entity26 that he wrote the book to make sure ' the next generation of athletes does n't make the same mistakes ' he did when he finally got paid the big @entity1 bucks			0
@entity6 said he followed the ' unwritten @entity46 ' rule and instead bought his mother a brand new big house , as well as paid for all her finances that did not include food or entertainment			1
but he soon realized that gift would come with its own problems			0
instead of selling her old house , like he advised , @entity6 's mother rented it to his aunt			1
this left @entity59 paying for mortgage and maintenance payments for both houses for seven years			2
@entity6 asks rookies to consider certain questions before buying their family ' big - ticket purchases ' , such as whether the family member would be able to make the payments if they could n't , or if the family member expected them to pay for upkeep 20 years later			1
the former football star said his mother never offered him the money she made from her sister 's rent , and later blamed him for ' messing up her life ' after he kicked her boyfriend out of the house he paid for			1
' what she did n't see was that her boyfriend was pimping her and me out , ' he wrote			0
' he was n't bringing anything to the table , just taking			0
' @entity6 said he bought his mother a house instead , which brought its own set of problems for years @entity6 ( pictured playing for the @entity11 ) said his relatives also asked him for money , claiming they needed a check to pay for repairs and bills @entity6 said he eventually became fed up and told his mother he would stop paying for her new house 's upkeep after he paid off the mortgage			1
when his mother said the house was too large for her to afford the maintenance , he offered to buy her a smaller house that he would pay for with cash and put in his name , protecting her from loans and giving his brothers and sisters a stable home			1
instead , his mother asked for $ 15,000 in cash			1
she ended up losing the home			0
' she told me that if the new house did n't have space for two living room sets , she did n't want it , ' @entity6 writes			0
@entity6 said he moved out of his house at 17 because he no longer ' felt secure ' in a home where his mother let people ' come in and out of the house and take what they wanted '			2
and the football player said he soon realized it would n't just be his mother asking him for money , but his relatives as well , who often had ' family emergencies '			0
@entity6 ( pictured with the @entity11 ) moved out of his house at 17 because he no longer ' felt secure ' at home because his mother let people ' come in and out of the house and take what they wanted ' @entity6 said at first he would just write his relatives a check , which he said would ' always get cashed ' even as the problems never got fixed			2
that 's when @entity6 said he started offering to pay for the ' emergencies ' directly to the mechanics or companies the money was supposedly owed to , only to have his relatives say ' forget about it '			0
@entity6 said he spent ' hundreds of thousands of dollars ' before learning how to deal with his family 's monetary demands			0
but he said it was the way his mother treated him that ended up teaching @entity6 ' the most important lessons in life '			2
' the mothers and fathers of the world have been rearing their kids for generations - in every culture imaginable - and it 's a one - way street when it comes to money , ' he writes			0
' if they pay you back someday , and you really are going through hard times , then that 's just a bonus , a gratuity for being a great mother or father			0

@entity6 was a first - round draft pick for the @entity8 in 2002 when his mother made what he called the ' desperate demand '
@entity6 , who is now retired , instead bought her a brand new house
but she *refused* to sell her old house and rented it to her sister
so he ended up paying maintenance for both houses for seven years without getting any of the rent money
when @entity6 finally had enough his mother asked for $ 15,000 instead of a smaller house whose upkeep she could afford
