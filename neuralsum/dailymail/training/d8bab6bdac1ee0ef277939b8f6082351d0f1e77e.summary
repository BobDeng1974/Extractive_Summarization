up to 700 officers swooped on addresses from @entity9 to @entity10 in co-ordinated dawn raids which were aimed at ‘ decapitating ’ their suspected underworld empire			1
the operation targeted the gas – guns and @entity16 – gang which runs a multi-million pound crack cocaine ring and is linked to a string of murders			1
senior officers said the gang , which has its roots in @entity9 , was increasingly stretching its ‘ tentacles ’ to new markets in other cities , the @entity22 and affluent suburbs			2
they warned that its leaders were willing to use extreme violence , often sparking bloody turf wars as they kicked out weaker rivals			0
victim : @entity34 was left paralysed after being gunned down in a gang - related shooting carried out by the @entity15 and @entity16 crew the gas gang was behind at least six killings in recent years , many fuelled by tit - for - tat rows over territory and ‘ respect ’			1
it was also responsible for the callous shooting that paralysed five - year - old @entity34 as she played in her uncle ’s shop in @entity46 , @entity9 , in 2011			1
yesterday police teams swooped on more than 20 addresses thought to belong to the ‘ top tier ’ of the criminal network , described as ‘ the most senior - ranking high - harm members ’			2
a total of 29 suspects , aged between 18 and 47 , were arrested at properties in @entity10 , @entity55 , @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 in @entity60			0
raids also took place on estates controlled by the gang in @entity65 and @entity46 , as well as across @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			1
search teams recovered thousands of pounds in cash and a huge amount of crack cocaine – the gang ’s main source of income			0
@entity77 , which was behind the operation , has enjoyed great success in targeting street gangs in recent years , recording substantial falls in associated crime			1
but one top officer said in some cases their activities have simply been displaced to other areas , including the @entity22			0
commander @entity88 said : ‘ this particular gang have identified drug markets across the country which they see as fruitful and have moved into them			2
the money comes back to @entity9 – these are @entity9 gangsters – but we are willing to follow them wherever they go			2
’ the raids were the latest phase in the crackdown , which has racked up a total of 88 arrests since it began in december			0
harrowing : @entity102 from inside @entity103 shows @entity104 lying on the floor having been shot in the chest in jail : after the attack on @entity34 gunman @entity109 ( left ) , 21 , was told he will serve a minimum of 17 years			1
his lieutenants @entity112 ( centre ) , 19 , @entity114 ( right ) , 20 , must serve at least 14 years the gas gang , which some say also stands for @entity117 , has been blamed for eight out of ten murders and serious attacks on its @entity9 home patch			1
it recruits children young as 12 , known as ‘ youngers ’ , to run errands and sell drugs			0
meanwhile senior members , known as ‘ elders ’ , use extreme violence to enforce a hugely profitable drug - dealing network			1
police have monitored a worrying trend of young men from war zones , including @entity134 , joining criminal street gangs			0
most recent shootings have been carried out using poor quality , converted starting pistols or antique guns , as police restrict the supply of firearms			0
but police fear the gang could have access to @entity147 machine guns , dubbed ‘ spray and pray ’ for their high rate of fire and inaccuracy			0
commander @entity88 added that police are monitoring a worrying trend in ‘ aggravated burglaries ’ where gang members threaten people in their homes			2
