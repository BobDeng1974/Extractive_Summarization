after weeks of tests @entity3 was put on medication to control her condition , but can still be sick five or six times a day if she gets nervous			1
ms @entity14 said : ‘ it was awful to watch @entity3 go through all this and not be able to help her in any way			2
‘ i was so worried about her and it did n’t matter how much i pleaded with doctors , they just could n’t pin down what was wrong with her			0
‘ i have two younger daughters and i could n’t be in the bathroom seeing to @entity3 all the time as well as looking after her sisters			1
‘ we have since found out it is a notoriously difficult condition to diagnose and when @entity3 first fell ill it felt like whichever way we turned we came to a dead end			1
’ it was only after appointments with five different doctors that @entity3 was diagnosed with the rare condition			1
ms @entity14 said : ‘ it had got to the point where i felt like we would never get answers and seeing @entity3 suffer was just horrible			2
@entity3 began constantly vomiting and writhing in pain with stomach cramps in september and after 48 hours of her constantly being sick , her mother @entity46 became seriously worried ‘ we tried so many different things to help stop her from being sick but there was nothing we could do			1
‘ she spent the majority of her days sitting in the bathroom just being sick repeatedly			1
’ @entity18 is characterised by recurrent , prolonged attacks of severe vomiting , nausea and lethargy , with no apparent cause			2

‘ i expected doctors to maybe say that it was just a virus not something as extreme as this			0
‘ as she had n’t lost any weight they did n’t think it was an eating disorder and the only conclusion they could come to was she was either pregnant or making it up			0
‘ i was completely gobsmacked when they asked me if she could be pregnant			0
‘ having to make her do the test i knew that it would come back negative but wanted to be able to prove it to the doctors			0
’ it was only when @entity3 saw the paediatrician she had as a toddler that he recognised her symptoms as being @entity18 , and started her on a course of treatment			1
after three months of constantly vomiting , @entity3 is now only sick when she feels particularly nervous or anxious and can now live a more normal life			1

‘ as a mum it was heartbreaking watching her being so ill and being unable to do anything for her			0
‘ now as long as she takes her medication and does n’t worry about things we can have a relatively normal day			2
’ dr @entity122 , chair of the @entity83 @entity82 , said : ‘ @entity18 affects people of any age			2
although it used to be thought of as a disease of childhood , it can develop in adults too			0

these attacks can last from one day to two weeks or more			0
@entity3 is now receiving treatment and is only sick when she feels particularly nervous or anxious ‘ at its peak vomiting can occur six times an hour			1
it is the most severe vomiting condition in humans			0
‘ relatively little is known about the causes and treatment can be difficult			0
