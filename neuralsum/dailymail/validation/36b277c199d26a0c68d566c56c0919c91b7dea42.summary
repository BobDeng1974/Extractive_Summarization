the @entity1 will have to negotiate with @entity3 president @entity2 for a political transition in @entity3 and is exploring ways to pressure him into agreeing to talks , @entity1 secretary of state @entity0 has admitted			1
@entity7 has long insisted that @entity2 must be replaced through a negotiated , political transition , but the rise of a common enemy , hardline militant group @entity10 , has evidently softened the administration 's stance towards him			1
in an interview broadcast on sunday , @entity0 did not repeat the standard @entity1 line that @entity2 had lost all legitimacy and had to go			2
@entity3 's civil war is now into its fifth year , with hundreds of thousands killed and millions of @entity3 displaced			1
' we 've always been willing to negotiate in the context of the @entity31 process , ' he added , referring to a 2012 conference which called for a negotiated transition to end the conflict			0
@entity0 said the @entity1 and other countries , which he did not name , were exploring ways to reignite the diplomatic process to end the conflict in @entity3			2
' what we 're pushing for is to get him ( @entity2 ) to come and do that , and it may require that there be increased pressure on him of various kinds in order to do that , ' the secretary of state said			1
new problem : the @entity1 has been more willing to deal with @entity2 since the rise to power of @entity52 in @entity3 and @entity53 opposition : @entity2 's regime is under attack from rebel soldiers , such as those above , as well as @entity52 's hordes ' we 've made it very clear to people that we are looking at increased steps that can help bring about that pressure , ' he added			1
the @entity1 led efforts to convene a @entity67 - backed peace talks in @entity31 last year between @entity69 - backed @entity3 opposition representatives and a government delegation			2
the talks collapsed after two rounds and no fresh talks have been scheduled			0
@entity74 convened some opposition and government figures in january for talks on the crisis but they yielded little progress and the main opposition coalition boycotted them			0
' to get the @entity2 regime to negotiate , we 're going to have to make it clear to him that there is a determination by everybody to seek that political outcome and change his calculation about negotiating , ' @entity0 said			2
' that 's under way right now			0
and i am convinced that , with the efforts of our allies and others , there will be increased pressure on @entity2			1
@entity3 sank into civil war after a peaceful street uprising against four decades of @entity2 family rule began in march 2011			1
the revolt spiraled into an armed insurgency , which has deepened with the rise of @entity10 and other hardliners			0
@entity2 seems more likely to survive the @entity3 crisis than at any point since it began			1
@entity109 's support for @entity2 is as solid as ever , with @entity74 showing no sign of abandoning him			2
before : @entity1 - @entity3 negotiations have n't always been this strained			0
he is pictured above with @entity114 in @entity115 in 2007 , before civil war broke out @entity1 - led forces started air strikes against @entity119 in @entity3 and @entity53 in the summer			1
@entity7 has said the campaign in @entity3 is not coordinated with the @entity3 military , which also views the group as its enemy			0
the war has killed more than 200,000 people and displaced close to half the population , according to the @entity67			0
@entity115 accuses its @entity69 and @entity129 @entity128 opponents of seeking to destroy the country by providing aid to an insurgency now dominated by jihadists , who also pose a threat to the @entity135			0
@entity2 appears to be betting that the @entity1 - led campaign against @entity10 will force @entity7 to engage with him .			0
