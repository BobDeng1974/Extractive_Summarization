they get a 3 - 0 win away to @entity2 and all of a sudden @entity3 is world class and everything is brilliant again			1
one gooner even said to me : ' it was a great weekend because all our rivals dropped points ! ' rivals for what ? top four ? i think you ’ll find @entity15 won			0
minimal expectation means @entity18 fans are satisfied way too easily , and so @entity20 manages the club under no pressure whatsoever			1
let ’s put some perspective on this result for @entity18 at the weekend			2
@entity3 ( centre ) celebrates with @entity27 ( left ) after scoring for @entity18 against @entity2 @entity3 charges forward with the ball during @entity18 's victory over @entity2 in @entity30 on saturday @entity18 manager @entity20 shakes hands with @entity32 , the @entity2 mascot , before the match @entity3 looked good against a side with @entity36 at the heart of their defence			1
a centre half who spent years at @entity18 gradually getting worse and worse			1
a @entity2 team that cost a fraction of @entity3 ’s left foot were well beaten in the end			2
but they started the better side before the blitz of goals that killed the game well before half time			0
the virus that hit the @entity2 camp robbed them of their man of the match at @entity57 the previous week , centre half @entity54			1
and crucially , midfielder @entity59 missed out – more on him later			0
@entity60 had to come off because he was feeling so ill , and @entity61 was also struggling			0
@entity62 confirmed afterwards that some of the staff had also been affected by the illness			2
@entity2 should be beaten by @entity18 , if you factor in quality and price of players and relative experience of the managers			1
@entity62 was spot on when he said that to beat a side like @entity18 you ca n’t afford to have a virus spreading through the camp			1
no virus at @entity77 helped @entity2 secure victory			2
and this thing @entity80 keep banging on about with @entity3 – they tell me he ’s brilliant in his best position , behind the striker			0
yet they still defend a manager who ’s taken more than a season to work that out ? @entity27 ( third left ) is congratulated by his team - mates after scoring @entity18 's second goal @entity27 makes no mistake as he puts the ball past @entity2 goalkeeper @entity92 into the net @entity18 have spent the last decade beating opponents they should beat and getting too much praise for it			1
and in those years , the @entity97 have wondered why so many questions are asked when they get absolutely battered by @entity99 , @entity57 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			0
and here we are again			0
@entity18 beat a @entity2 side that cost a pittance and was ravaged with illness , and the @entity99 debacle is forgotten by the fans			1
and people wonder why @entity20 keeps making the same mistakes over and over and over again in the big games ? the @entity2 virus is so bad the training ground was due to be temporarily shut down this week			1
midfielder @entity59 was throwing up in the warm up and despite being named in the original xi he could n’t start the game he was so ill. with him patrolling in front of the back four there is no way @entity3 would have had such an easy day			0
if @entity20 is as shrewd as his supporters believe he is , he will have realised @entity59 ’s absence was the key to @entity18 ’s victory			1
@entity3 evades the challenge of @entity2 's @entity36 to score the opening goal on saturday @entity2 's @entity59 ( right ) leaves the field after falling ill during the pre-match warm - up @entity20 might also work out for himself that @entity59 is exactly the holding midfielder @entity18 need			1
@entity130 left the @entity131 in 2008 and @entity18 have n’t had a decent anchorman since			2
@entity133 would have been better than some of the players @entity20 has tried to slot in that role			0
at the end of it all , it ’s a win , a goal an assist and a good performance from @entity3			0
so , ' when will i give @entity20 credit ? ' i hear gooners ask			0
when he deserves it , is my reply			0
video it 's the response we needed - @entity20			2

@entity18 beat @entity2 3 - 0 in the @entity153 at @entity154 on saturday
minimal expections means @entity18 fans are satisfied too easily
@entity20 manages the club under no pressure whatsoever
the @entity162 were hit by a virus which forced @entity62 to close their training ground
@entity18 fans have spent the last decade getting too much praise for beating opponents they should beat
