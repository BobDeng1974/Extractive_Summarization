several @entity1 schools have dropped the new federal rules pushed by first lady @entity3 after saying they had an overwhelming negative reaction from students			0
@entity8 business manager @entity7 said ' there were just too many complaints ' for his district to stay in the @entity12			1
' universally , it was , ‘ we are starving			0
this is n’t enough food for us			0
’ but we could n’t blame them , because i looked at that school lunch and said , ‘ i would n’t eat it either , ’ he told @entity21			0
this summer @entity3 met with officials who claimed the guidelines were working in their schools			1
the @entity44 reports that the @entity1 district had sales jump 20 per cent after abandoning the new rules			1
they now offer bigger portions and have increased their prices as well as offering ' locally sourced produce and beef			0
' the district 's food service director @entity53 told reporters : ' a one - size - fits - all program does n't work everywhere			1
smaller districts may have more problems with the guidelines since they have a smaller staff to deal with the changes and many students have chosen to bring lunches to school rather than purchase the new offerings ' and i also think that food is a little too personal to make a law			1
you can tell someone they ca n’t speed , but i do n’t you can tell everybody what they have to eat every day			0
' the districts that have left the federal program do not get reimbursements			2
@entity80 student @entity79 told @entity1 media that last year the portions were not big enough and he often brought his won lunch to school			0
@entity85 in @entity1 is one of several schools to abandon the regulations citing poor sales and student complaints but since the changes he 's satisfied with the school 's offerings			2
' i 've never brought a bag lunch this year , ' he said			0
at least one rural @entity98 district has also dropped the regulations			2
administrators blamed poor sales to students and a large amount of paperwork			2
more whole wheat , more green veggies , no salt - it 's not as palatable , ' said @entity111 business manager @entity110 , who added that the paperwork to ensure each serving met the standards for nutrition was too much to deal with			1
smaller districts may have more problems with the guidelines since they have a smaller staff to deal with the changes .			1

@entity8 business manager @entity7 said ' there were just too many complaints ' for his district to stay in the @entity12
claimed portion sizes were too small and *unappetizing*
smaller districts have reported trouble handling paperwork tracking nutrition in meals
