there are still hundreds of thousands of new cases of leprosy across the globe every year			2
here , a man in @entity5 suffers from the disease leprosy has plagued mankind throughout history , but is far , far older than stories about the disease in the @entity11 , according to scientists			0
a new study claims the disease is probably the oldest infectious disease in humans with roots stretching back millions of years			2
a scientist at the @entity20 @entity19 in @entity21 found that two leprosy - causing bacteria came from a last common bacterial ancestor around 10 million years ago and that ancient humans and hominids suffered from the disease			1
there are still hundreds of thousands of new cases of leprosy across the globe every year , which attacks a sufferer ’s skin and nerves			1
if left untreated it can lead to disabilities and even death			0
in 2008 pathologist @entity37 discovered a new leprosy bacteria and since then has analysed 20 genes of @entity40 and the better known mycobacterium leprae bacteria			2
his team found that the two bacteria came from a last common ancestor around 10 million years ago , according to the study in the journal @entity47			1
before this point it is thought that the common bacteria ancestor underwent a massive reductive evolution that resulted in inactivation of approximately 40 per cent of all the genes in its genome			2
together with @entity56 , of the @entity58 ’s @entity57 , professor @entity37 said that leprosy is a strict human disease that stretches back millions of years			2
they came up with the theory based upon a number of pieces of evidence			0
researchers at the @entity20 in @entity21 found that two leprosy - causing bacteria , including @entity68 ( pictured ) were pinpointed to come from a last common bacterial ancestor around 10 million years ago , meaning that ancient humans and hominids suffered from the disease leprosy is an infectious disease that causes severe , disfiguring skin sores and nerve damage in the arms and legs			1
the disease has been around since the beginning of time , often surrounded by frightening , negative stigma and tales of leprosy patients being shunned as outcasts			0
at one time or another , outbreaks of leprosy have affected people on every continent , according to @entity90			0
the oldest civilisations of @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 feared leprosy was an incurable , mutilating and contagious disease			0
however , leprosy is surprisingly not highly contagious			0
it can only be caught by coming into close contact with nose and mouth droplets from someone with untreated , severe leprosy			0
although rarely seen in the @entity103 , the @entity102 says more than 200,000 people worldwide are infected with leprosy - most of them in @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			1
leprosy bacteria can not live outside the human body - with the rare exception of wild armadillos thought to have been infected by @entity114 explorers a few hundred years ago			1
over 400 strains of @entity68 analysed so far have been found to have virtually identical genomes , suggesting that human beings carried the leprosy bacteria when departing @entity106 around 100,000 years ago to populate the rest of the world			1
this means that leprosy bacteria are extraordinarily stable within their human hosts - a sign of mature parasitic life far older than 100,000 years			1
the oldest age of the leprosy bacteria ’s pseudogenes suggest that gene inactivation began approximately 20 million years ago , which is probably the point when the ancestor of leprosy bacteria jumped to our early human ancestors and transitioned from free - living to strictly parasitic			1
the duo ’s hypothesis that leprosy existed for millions of years offers new insights into disease pathogenesis			2
the parasitic adaptation of the leprosy bacteria inside hominid - human hosts is similar to a very long hide - and - seek game			1
over 400 strains of @entity68 analysed so far have been found to have virtually identical genomes , suggesting that human beings carried the bacteria when departing @entity106 100,000 years ago to populate the rest of the world			1
the disease features in several biblical stories and a painting by @entity150 is pictured the parasite would have hidden by mutating or removing harmful molecules while retaining protective ones , which in the end lead to evasion from host immunity - a phenomenon commonly seen in leprosy			0
professors @entity37 and @entity56 concluded that leprosy can be viewed as a natural consequence of a long parasitism			0
professor @entity37 said : discovering the new leprosy agent @entity40 was incidental			0
however , locating this additional leprosy cause significantly adds to our understanding of the ancient disease			0
‘ in particular , tracing the ultimate origin of leprosy through the parasitic adaptive evolution of the leprosy bacteria is rather insightful , not only for this single disease but also for our better understanding of the mechanism behind other human infections			1

a @entity20 @entity21 study found two leprosy - causing bacteria came from a common bacterial ancestor around 10 million years ago
humans carried leprosy bacteria when departing @entity106 around 100,000 years ago to populate the rest of the world
hundreds of thousands of people around the world still suffer from the disease , which attacks a sufferer *'s* skin and nerves
