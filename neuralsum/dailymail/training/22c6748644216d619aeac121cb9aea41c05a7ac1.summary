they spent months together inside their mother 's womb			1
but twins @entity4 and @entity6 do not share a birthday - because they were born five days apart			1
the boys , who will soon celebrate their second birthday , were born at just 24 weeks after their mother @entity10 went into premature labour			1
but after giving birth to @entity4 - and expecting @entity6 any minute - miss day 's cervix inexplicably closed			1
@entity6 ( left ) and @entity4 ( right ) @entity15 are twins but they were born five days apart			1
@entity4 was born on july 19 , 2012 and @entity6 followed on july 24			1
@entity4 was born when their mother was just 24 weeks pregnant she said : ‘ a doctor gave me an inspection and was amazed			1
@entity4 ’s placenta and @entity6 were still stuck inside			2
‘ i had to wait five more days before i went into labour again			0
i went down to be by @entity4 ’s incubator while i was still pregnant with @entity6			1
‘ it was so strange to be there with my newborn son , while i was still pregnant			0
’ @entity4 arrived on july 19 , 2012 weighing just 1lb 12oz and required emergency treatment to keep him alive			1
he was wrapped in plastic to keep him warm and rushed to a specialist care unit			0
@entity6 was delivered on july 24 , weighing just under 2lb			1
the boys had almost arrived even earlier , after miss day ’s waters broke when she was just 21 weeks pregnant			1
she said : ‘ i felt two huge gushes and rushed to hospital immediately			0
once i was there , i was told that my waters had broken			0
‘ a team of neonatal specialists attended to me and told me that if the boys started to arrive there and then , they were almost certain not to survive			0
@entity4 ( pictured ) weighed just 1lb 12oz when he was born and required emergency treatment to keep him alive after @entity4 's birth , miss day 's cervix inexplicably closed again			1
as a result , @entity6 ( pictured ) was not born immediately as expected			2
he was delivered after she went into labour again five days later ‘ they would have tried to save them , but the chances were n’t good			0
‘ i prayed for them to hang on to 24 weeks , to allow them to benefit from steroids to help their lungs develop			2
’ amazingly , doctors managed to prevent the birth until @entity4 was born at 24 weeks – the legal abortion limit			1
in the weeks following the birth miss day , a former nurse , and her partner , @entity60 , 27 , a telecoms project manager , were warned @entity4 might not survive			1
miss day , of @entity61 in @entity62 , said : ‘ when i tell people our twins were born five days apart , they ’re always amazed			1
it ’s not something you hear about every day			0
‘ it was touch and go after they were born			0
they were in intensive care for four months			2
doctors warned us at one point that @entity4 might not survive 24 hours			2
‘ they came home on my 30th birthday - which was an enormous treat – and three weeks ago we were able to take @entity4 ’s oxygen away			2
miss @entity10 says it was a surreal experience to see @entity4 in an incubator while she was still pregnant @entity4 and @entity6 ( pictured together in an incubator ) have not both learned to walk and talk but their development is expected to catch up with other children			1
they are pictured with their parents , @entity10 and @entity60 ‘ they ’re doing fine now , considering what they ’ve been through			0
they ’re very loving towards one another			0
’ @entity4 required further steroid treatment as well as laser eye surgery and two operations to fix hernias			0
@entity6 was born stronger than his brother but still required incubation and a course of antibiotics			0
@entity6 was able to leave hospital after three months , and @entity6 was to follow a month later , so that on miss day ’s 30th birthday she had both her boys at home with her for the first time			1
until three weeks ago , @entity4 required oxygen through a tube to aid his development			2
he is not walking yet and @entity6 has yet to say his first words , but doctors are confident they are hitting the correct developmental milestones considering their rocky start in life			0
miss day said : ‘ last year we had one birthday for the two of them but this year we ’re celebrating their birthdays on different days - they have different birthdays , whichever way you look at it			2
‘ @entity6 is definitely the one in charge , but he ’s very caring towards @entity4			2
he ’s always giving him hugs and even helps to put food into his mouth			0
he ’s quite protective over him			0
