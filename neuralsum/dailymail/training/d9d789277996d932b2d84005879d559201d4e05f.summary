by @entity0 updated : 07:27 est , 25 may 2012 islamists are widely expected to win a majority in @entity4 's new parliament after threatening a crackdown on alcohol and bikinis			1
the popularity of the @entity10 's @entity9 has left @entity12 tourist industry fearing they will be elected when the parliament reconvenes next month			1
the @entity10 has said tourists can do without alcohol while ultra-conservative @entity16 candidates have taken it a step further by demanding a ban on all alcohol sales			1
@entity4 's planned crackdown on booze and bikinis could hamper the tourism industry			1
picture : @entity24 and pyramids of @entity26 in @entity27 they 've also called for segregating @entity4 's beaches by sex and banning revealing swimwear			1
political unrest and violence have kept tourists away from this and other @entity4 landmarks since the fall of former president , @entity38			1
officials say the number of visitors this holiday season is down by more than one - third compared to the same time last year			0
@entity43 , the senior assistant tourism minister , said : ' these are irresponsible statements in my opinion that , even if said by responsible people , i believe they do not understand the set - up of the industry and the dynamics of it			0
' ' four out of five tourists who come to @entity4 do so for leisure vacations at the beach rather than to visit the pyramids or other historical sites			1
' more than three - quarters of all visitors to @entity4 are from @entity59 , ' he says			2
' they expect to be able to enjoy the beach as they would at home			0
politicians have called for segregating @entity4 's beaches by sex and banning revealing swimwear ' to swim , you wear a bathing costume			1
to have dinner , part of the culture is to have a drink with the dinner			0
' this is the kind of information people have to understand that do not understand the industry			0
and you do n't change the culture of people , ' mr @entity43 said			0
but @entity82 , the @entity83 lawmaker , says @entity4 officials need to rethink their approach to tourism			2
she argues that appealing to @entity10 visitors abroad and domestically will boost tourism , as would hosting more international conferences			0
she adds that separating beaches by sex and curbing public consumption of alcohol wo n't affect these new markets or even the old ones			2
such pronouncements are naive , says @entity97 , who chairs the @entity98 and runs a company specialising in conference tourism			0
he says he 's talked with the @entity10 and the @entity16 at length about their tourism proposals and why they wo n't work			1
he believes that once the @entity83 are in power and faced with the financial reality , they 'll stop trying to make @entity4 tourists conform to a more conservative @entity110 lifestyle			2
' if they were not pragmatic , could they have collected so many votes ? ' mr @entity97 said			0
' they were very pragmatic and very sly , we have to remember this			0
