' @entity0 first developed symptoms of the condition when he was just six months old , but it was first mistaken for club foot and then for @entity62			1

@entity24 is caused by a genetic mutation			0

' @entity11 will help @entity0 get some independence as he gets older			1
' the charities said they could n't give him a dog until he was 15 , as that 's when he 'd start going out on his own , but we do n't even know if he 'll still be here then so we wanted to act now			0
' @entity11 's training is costing the family £ 31 an hour so they have started fundraising to cover the costs			2
