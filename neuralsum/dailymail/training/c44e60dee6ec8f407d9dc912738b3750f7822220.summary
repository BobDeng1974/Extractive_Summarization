@entity2 's budget response flopped because he had based it on @entity5 predictions , @entity6 ( left ) said mr @entity2 was widely criticised for spending 16 minutes reading out political attack lines while barely mentioning the content of the @entity25			1
mr @entity6 was similarly derided for his response to the @entity27 in december			1
yesterday he appeared to be revelling in his leader ’s misfortune in an astonishing post-budget briefing for journalists			2
while a stony - faced @entity2 aide looked on , he said : ‘ @entity2 had written pages of his speech which were n’t used in the end , which he thought might be in there that were n’t , but he had to fill the space by going on and on about @entity18 ’s comments			1
’ the @entity7 said mr @entity2 and he had read an ‘ excellent tweet ’ by one journalist that suggested mr @entity13 would ‘ link welfare cuts to the personal allowance ’			1

twisting the knife , mr @entity6 also took to the television studios to say : ‘ it was a difficult speech for @entity2			1
’ mr @entity2 was widely criticised for spending 16 minutes reading out political attack lines while barely mentioning the content of the budget rather than analysing the announcements about changes to pension annuities and @entity63 , the @entity7 revealed instead that he spent a long section of the speech urging @entity66 to dig communities secretary @entity67 in the ribs			1
mr @entity6 said : ‘ @entity67 fell asleep for a quite extended period of time and @entity2 and i were worried because there might have been some big cut in local government spending coming which he did n’t know about			1
‘ we just politely suggested to @entity66 that he should wake him up			0

at present , those who sign up to tax avoidance schemes pay what they think they can get away with , and then it is up to @entity102 to claw the full amount back through the courts – which can take years			0
the chancellor said that in future the wealthy will have to pay the full rate of tax back as soon as their avoidance scheme is deemed by @entity102 to be unlawful			2
they will then have to go to court to argue their case to have some of it returned			0
mr @entity13 said the move , backed by greater powers and a bigger budget for the @entity102 , would raise some £ 4billion over four years			2

‘ it was the budget that proved conclusively @entity2 is not yet ready to be prime minister of this country , ’ he wrote			1
‘ he talked about everything but the budget that had just been unveiled in front of him			2
any leader of the opposition has an obligation to do better than this			0
