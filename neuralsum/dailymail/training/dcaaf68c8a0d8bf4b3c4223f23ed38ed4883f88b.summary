@entity1 troops have replaced policemen in half of a large state that borders @entity5 , in the deep south , because there were fears that the officers were corrupt and helping the drug cartels			2
some 2,800 heavily armed soldiers were deployed in 22 of @entity13 's 43 cities over the weekend - this was done , in part , as president @entity16 moved to defend his drug war strategy			1
as the streets of @entity1 become increasingly bloodstained , the 48 - year - old , who began his fierce crackdown on drug trafficking - which , according to the @entity22 @entity21 , earns up to $ 48.4 billion a year - in 2006 , faces strong criticism from activists			1
armed to the teeth : some 2,800 @entity1 soldiers have been deployed to @entity13 , which borders @entity5 you 're nicked : a suspected memeber of the @entity31 cartel is taken away by @entity1 anti-drug soldiers close to the border : @entity13 neighbours @entity5 for decades the @entity1 government employed a passive attitude to the cartels , but that changed in december 2006 when the newly appointed mr @entity16 sent 6,500 troops to @entity31 to end the violence there			1
the war against drugs has escalated and now there are over 45,000 troops involved , with the president justifying the increase in troops because - as he said last year - the cartels seek ' to replace the government ' and ' are trying to impose a monopoly by force of arms , and are even trying to impose their own laws '			1
on the offensive : @entity16 started his crackdown on the drug cartels weeks after taking charge of @entity1 in december 2006 the cost has been heavy , both financially and in terms of life - across @entity1 , since mr @entity16 began his crackdown , there have been some 38,000 drug - related deaths , according to official figures			1
on the ground , the men in imposing , heavy black uniform , helmets and armed to the teeth , took to the streets in the state 's largest cities , including the capital , @entity72 , and the border cities of @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76			0
@entity1 's @entity77 insisted ' the support is of temporary and extraordinary character ' but an official in @entity74 , who wished to remain anonymous , told @entity82 that local police have been replaced while they are investigated for corruption			0
police on the take are one of the biggest hurdles for mr @entity16 and his soldiers have to eradicate in order to best combat the drug cartels - in the past purges of police departments have been carried out , but the unnamed official said he had ' never seen such a large operation and so many soldiers here '			1
according to the @entity77 the local government of @entity13 had requested the assistance from the @entity1 government			0
heavy duty : the soldiers have been moved in as the police were feared corrupt and helping the drug cartels activists : people are shown on the streets in @entity108 in may to protest against the president 's obsession with breaking the cartels troops were moved in to @entity113 , too , where authorities discovered mass graves containing more than 200 corpses earlier this year , while investigating the kidnapping of passengers from a bus			1
and last year the bodies of 72 migrants from @entity123 and @entity124 were found at a nearby ranch			0
peaceful : @entity127 turned activist @entity128 lost his son to the drug violence and urged president @entity16 to halt his offensive a drug cartel called the @entity134 were blamed for the mass graves and for the deaths of the migrants			1
in addition , @entity138 - which almost became a ghost town last year following wave of violence followed the assassination of a @entity145 cartel leader - will also see troops move in			2
the replacement of the police comes only days after @entity1 poet and activist @entity128 , leader of the @entity151 , discussed scaling down the offensive with mr @entity153 , 56 , lost his son in the drug wars and mr @entity16 apologised to the families of the victims of the violence , but defended himself at the meeting			2
later , he took to his @entity160 account and wrote : ' they say that everything is the government 's fault for sending the army to combat the criminals			2
' that premise is wrong			0
there is not violence because there are federal forces in place			0
it is the opposite : the federal forces are there because there is violence			0
' to reconstruct institutions , we have to purge and strengthen police , prosecutors , judges , in all of the states and at the federal level			0
