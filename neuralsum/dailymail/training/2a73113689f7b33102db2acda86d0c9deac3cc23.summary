by @entity0 published : 20:41 est , 20 february 2014 @entity2 : 04:28 est , 21 february 2014 dr @entity4 , a member of the @entity6 's @entity5 , signalled rates could rise by next spring households should prepare for interest rates to rise early next year , a senior official at the @entity6 declared last night			1
dr @entity4 , who sits on the powerful committee which sets rates at the central bank , said borrowing costs are likely to increase in spring 2015			1
but he added that the first rate hike since july 2007 could come even sooner than that in a stark warning to borrowers that the era of ultra-cheap home loans is coming to an end			1
the explosive comments - the most explicit signal yet of when rates will rise - raised the prospect of a hike before the @entity24 in may 2015			1
analyst said guidance on interest rates ‘ does not get much more specific than that ’			2
it marked a dramatic change of tack for the bank which has in the past refused to comment on when it plans to raise or cut interest rates			2
governor @entity35 last week hinted that rates could rise next year - but his comments were far more measured than those by dr @entity4 yesterday			1
the prospect of higher borrowing costs will alarm millions of households who have benefited from cheap mortgages since rates were slashed to an all - time low of 0.5 per cent in march 2009			2
but dr @entity4 also suggested that the benefits for savers will be limited with rates only expected to rise slowly and stay well below the 5 per cent average seen before the financial crisis			1
‘ i think it is very helpful if we try and explain that the most likely path for interest rates is that the first rise will come perhaps in the spring of next year , ’ said dr @entity4			1
‘ and then the path is likely to be relatively gradual			0
’ he added : ‘ i could n’t rule out the need for a rate rise coming earlier			1
’ @entity56 , chief @entity57 economist at @entity58 , said : ‘ you do n’t get much more specific forward guidance than that			0
’ dr @entity4 , a highly respected economist who has sat on the @entity6 ’s monetary policy committee since 2010 , said the timing of the @entity24 would have little impact on the decision			1
‘ during an election campaign it would obviously be difficult but the election campaign will last for three weeks , ’ he said			0
the @entity6 has already moved the day it sets interest rates in may 2015 from the seventh - the day voters go to the polls - to the 15th so as not to clash with the election			2
a rate rise before polling day could spook millions of borrowers worried about their mortgage costs			1
but it would be welcomed by savers who have been hammered by low returns since the financial crisis struck and rates were cut to emergency lows			2
@entity83 , chief economist at research group @entity84 , said : ‘ if the economy is judged resilient enough to absorb a rate hike then it ’s something to celebrate			2
’ @entity88 has said that the discussion around the possibility of higher interest rates ‘ is a mark of success ’ because it shows ‘ we have started to see the recovery take off ’			1
it marked a dramatic change of tack for the bank which has in the past refused to comment on when it plans to raise or cut interest rates the bank last week raised its growth forecasts for the @entity57 economy for this year from 2.8 per cent to 3.4 per cent			0
economic growth has not been stronger since 2003			0
mr @entity35 hailed @entity57 as ‘ one of the strongest economies in the advanced world ’ as he predicted robust growth , tumbling unemployment and low inflation in the coming years			0
mortgage lender @entity112 estimates that around one million people have got on to the property ladder for the first in the past five years			0
many will have stretched their budget to the limit in order to get on to the ladder - but will now have to find a way to increase their repayments			0
@entity123 , chief executive of @entity112 , has raised fears over ‘ a whole generation of borrowers how have never experienced increases in their monthly mortgage payments ’			0
mr @entity35 has insisted that any rate rises will be ‘ gradual ’ and ‘ limited ’			0
he raised the prospect of rates only rising to 2 per cent by early 2017 and staying at between 2 per cent and 3 per cent until around 2020			0
the @entity132 , who succeeded @entity134 as @entity135 in july last year , said the @entity5 will not return rates to the 5 per cent average seen before the financial crisis any time soon .			0
