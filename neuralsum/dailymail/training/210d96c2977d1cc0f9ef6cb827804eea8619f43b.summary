as usual , @entity0 was n’t going to accept criticism			1
when a journalist persisted in a line of questioning about the shortcomings of the new system @entity7 had adopted during their friendly with @entity10 , @entity2 finally lost patience			1
‘ i ’ve been assigned to win			2
i need to get the best out of this team			0
that and nothing else , ’ he snapped back			0
he then added , lest anyone be in any doubt as to who was in charge : ‘ i make my own decisions on what formation i play			0
no director says how i play			0
i choose a team and a system that i think has the best chance of success			0
’ one 's enough : @entity29 scored the only goal as an experimental @entity7 triumphed 1 - 0 over @entity10 bombardment : @entity32 ( above ) took it in turns with @entity35 to attack the @entity10 penalty box playing behind @entity29 wasteful : @entity7 's winning margin over @entity10 could have been much more had @entity35 not squandered a number of chances ‘ @entity40 ’ it was n’t , but @entity7 had emerged from their penultimate @entity42 warm - up game with a 1 - 0 victory , secured when @entity29 tapped in after just five minutes , and @entity2 was happy enough			1
as he pointed out , @entity7 had created six good opportunities at the @entity45 in @entity46 and @entity10 had created not one			1
they would have been home and dry by half - time had @entity35 not been so wasteful			0
it was an open secret that @entity2 was set to trial a new formation in this match and those who did n’t know could easily have guessed it from friday ’s training session which was attended by 5,000 fans			0
the accent was on flying wing - backs - on this occasion , @entity61 of @entity62 and @entity63 of @entity64 - in a 5 - 3 - 2 formation that could quickly shift to a 3 - 4 - 3 when @entity7 were on the attack			1
@entity61 and @entity63 were encouraged to bomb forward at every opportunity and they contributed assists for @entity35 ’s two squandered chances in the first - half , showing the potential effectiveness of the system			2
in the midfield , @entity74 and @entity75 offered cover for the defence against any @entity80 counter-attacks and , up front , @entity29 spearheaded a forward trio of @entity35 and @entity32			1
plan b : @entity7 boss @entity0 deployed a 5 - 3 - 2 formation which morphed into a 3 - 4 - 3 during the win lead role : @entity2 's new system is set to fit at @entity89 next season , with @entity90 likely to spearhead the attack strong support cast : @entity93 ( right ) and @entity94 would play off @entity90 in the formation it was a formation that certainly has the potential to be exciting and the critical tone of some of the questions in the post-match press conference would surely have been avoided if @entity7 had won 3 - 0 or 4 - 0 like they should have done			1
@entity2 said he had devised the system as a means of playing @entity105 at their own game , of fighting fire with fire , when they meet in their opening @entity42 group match on june 13			2
he also hinted that it could be a set - up he brings to the @entity114 when he takes over as @entity89 manager next season - or ‘ after the @entity42 final ’ as he put it			1
if that happens , we ’ll certainly be in for some fun and games at @entity122			0
@entity2 will need two attack - minded wing - backs to thunder up and down the flanks and deliver effective crosses			1
@entity127 ’s £ 27m move from @entity128 looks set to be confirmed any day and the teenager will be given a licence to attack in the @entity89 tradition regardless of the formation			1
blind is also on the @entity122 radar and could also serve in his natural defensive midfield role			0
@entity2 will then need someone identical on the right - hand side , either @entity138 or the likes of @entity140 , whose time at @entity141 is reportedly drawing to a close , or @entity143 , the buccaneering @entity145 player who is interesting @entity146 as @entity148 ’s replacement			0
pulling the strings ? long time @entity89 target @entity150 ( left ) would be an ideal fit in midfield versatile : @entity61 featured against @entity10 at left - back and the @entity62 star can also play as a defensive midfielder closing in : @entity89 are hoping to complete a £ 27million deal for @entity128 and @entity159 left - back @entity127 a timid @entity10 side , which contained a number of second string players in the first - half as coach @entity164 makes the final call on his 23 for @entity166 , failed to trouble the @entity169 back line , but that will be a different story in the @entity114			1
accordingly , @entity2 is targeting @entity172 of @entity173 and @entity174 to strengthen his defence			0
@entity89 ’s midfield were regularly embarrassed last season during the @entity179 tenure and reinforcements are desperately needed here too			2
@entity2 will look at compatriot @entity181 , who was very impressive for @entity182 before a cruciate ligament injury curtailed his season			0
he would certainly be in the @entity169 @entity42 midfield if not for this misfortune			2
@entity141 ’s @entity150 would fill the vacancy with style but @entity89 face stiff competition for his signature from @entity146 and @entity191			1
up front , it would be @entity90 leading the attack ahead of @entity93 and @entity94			1
there ’s a strong possibility that @entity93 is heading for a midfield role under @entity2 and he ’s likely to be overlooked for the captain ’s armband in favour of @entity90 , who gets on very well with his national team manager			2
but on the evidence of the match with @entity10 , this does not necessarily mean that @entity93 will cut a frustrated figure as he sits backs in the midfield			1
@entity32 and @entity35 took turns to try and break into the penalty box , while @entity90 was not shy in dropping back to try and win the ball			0
the goalscorer would often by found trying to win the ball aerially close to the touchline from goal kicks and long balls from defence , with @entity63 a willing outlet out wide			0
@entity2 fervently believes his new system will deliver the @entity169 success at the @entity42			2
how about defending champions @entity105 as the acid test ?			0

@entity0 tried experimental formation in @entity7 's 1 - 0 win over @entity10
@entity7 boss says he could use system at @entity89 after the @entity42
formation favours **key** trio of @entity93 , @entity29 and @entity94
*rampaging* full - backs a **key** feature with target @entity127 a perfect fit
@entity236 also *monitoring* @entity150 to add strength to midfield
