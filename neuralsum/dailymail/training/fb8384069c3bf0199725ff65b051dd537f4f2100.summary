it sounds like the dieting miracle millions have been waiting for but it 's one a new book claims is now possible to achieve			2
last week we serialised an exciting new slimming plan by @entity13 weight - loss expert , dr @entity14			1
her @entity15 claims you can lose up to 9lb every week by sticking to one non-food day ( in which you drink homemade smoothies and drop 2lb as you sleep ) and then six days of eating foods which diets usually ban - including potatoes and peanut butter			1
the secret to its success lies in doing everything you can to preserve muscle			0
we all lose muscle mass as we age - at the rate of one per cent a year from the age of 30 - and dieting can make this worse			1
when the body detects a significant drop in food intake it looks to your muscles for extra energy			1
this means you get thinner - but you also get weaker and flabbier when the weight creeps back on as fat as it does for 95 per cent of dieters			1
last week we showed the smoothie recipes that will keep you feeling full on the no - food day and outlined the eating rules to abide by			1
if you missed it you can find this first part by searching for ' overnight diet ' at dailymail.co.uk			2
today , in the final part of our exclusive serialisation , we explain how a quick and simple exercise regime done just a few days each week is the most effective way to keep your body in the best shape it can be			0
the government recommends you find 30 minutes each day for fitness to maintain your weight and 90 minutes a day if you want to start shifting the pounds			1
but who has the time and inclination - especially if you 're on a diet and feeling hungry - to do that ? in fact , dr @entity14 is convinced the exercise recommendations of not just the government but also many popular diets could actually be preventing you from reaching your weight - loss goals			1
' for decades , diets have been promoting aerobic exercise as the best way to burn calories and shed pounds , ' she says			0
' but the combination of very low - calorie diets with hours of cardiovascular exercise may put the body into a catabolic state in which it robs the muscles for fuel			2
' instead , dr @entity14 has devised a short , sharp exercise plan which will not just maintain the muscle you do have but also add more - so speeding up your metabolism - without bulking you up			1
this workout plan is based on a growing body of research that shows combining resistance training with short bursts of cardiovascular activity burns far more body fat than doing the two separately			2
in short you get double the impact in half the time			0
she recommends doing it four times a week			0
the easy - to - follow exercises outlined here strengthen nearly every major muscle group in the body while improving balance and flexibility			2
and you do n't have to join a gym or invest in any special equipment ; you can do dr @entity14 's 21 minute workout any time , anywhere - so there are no excuses ! works : abdomen , chest , shoulders and triceps ( bingo wings ) works : chest , shoulders , triceps and abdominals the @entity118 @entity119 : calves , thighs , hips , buttocks and abdominals start each session with a three - minute ' dynamic warm - up '			1
the aim is to warm up the muscles all around your body and raise your heart rate			0
so , run through various vigorous leg and arm moves - marching on the spot bringing your knees up high ; then take your legs behind you , kicking your bottom with your heels as you march ; swing your leg from side to side , moving your arms above and around your head as you do so			2
then , with one eye on a stop - watch , start doing the strength - training exercises ( outlined in the box to the right ) in two - minute blasts interspersed with one - minute bursts of aerobic activity called ' rev - up blasts '			2
these 60 - second blasts are designed to get your heart pumping - try fast walking , marching on the spot , or sprinting fast ( depending on your fitness levels ) , running up and down steps , star jumps , or , if you are already quite fit , ' toe touch jumps ' ( raise both arms above your head , then crouch down and touch your toes , then jump as you bring them up over your head again and repeat )			0
each strength - training exercise is designed to work on one group of muscles at a time - from the buttocks , legs and tummy , to your chest and arms - concentrating on the biggest muscle groups for maximum impact			0
the important thing is to move quickly without taking any breaks , and vary your selection of exercises each time to keep different muscle groups working			0
start at the simplest level , but adjust the difficulty as you get fitter and stronger ( you 'll know as soon as the exercise starts to feel easy and this will be quicker than you think ! )			0
these easy moves can help you tone up forever , according to the @entity15 works : buttocks , rear thighs and lower back keep the weight off long term if you follow the @entity15 diligently you could lose as much as 9lb in a week , more than a stone in two weeks , and , if you stick to the plan , you could even be 2½st lighter by this time next month			1
when you reach your ideal weight - which will be sooner than you think - it is very important not to simply revert to your old , bad dietary habits once you can comfortably get into your skinny jeans again			1
dr @entity14 's studies show it is easy to maintain your new shape if you commit to always getting your daily protein allowance ( which we explained how to work out last week ) and regular muscle - strengthening exercise sessions			1
it is then up to you how you choose to modify the once a week smoothie day by either : you can also tweak your six - day plan to include a variety of foods such as : extracted by @entity0 from the @entity15 by dr @entity14 , published by @entity214 , priced £ 12.99			1
