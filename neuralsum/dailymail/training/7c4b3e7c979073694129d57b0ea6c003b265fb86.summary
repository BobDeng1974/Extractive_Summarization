lieutenant commander @entity60 , pilot and duty aircraft commander , said : ' we had to get as near to them as we could , so that we could safely winch our aircrewman down , but , because we knew that they were not only on unstable ground , but that one of them was holding the other by his crook , we had to keep the hover as high as possible to avoid dislodging either the people or the scree with the downwash from the helicopter			2
' with the low cloud base , however , this was very difficult			0
the pair were rescued from @entity77 , in the @entity78 ( above ) , which is 2,651ft high and popular with walkers ' there was no question of our aircrewman chief petty officer @entity83 detaching from the winch - the conditions underfoot were just too unpredictable			2
' so , we had to put ourselves into a steady hover about 100ft directly above them both			0
' boogie went down on the wire and managed to quickly secure a strop around the lower of the two men , before recovering him to the aircraft			0
