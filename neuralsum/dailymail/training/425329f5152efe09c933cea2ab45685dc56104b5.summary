by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 20 july 2012 updated : 19:48 est , 20 july 2012 maybe he did n’t like the weather at home			2
or perhaps he simply fancied a cruise			0
whatever the reason , when @entity7 the racing pigeon set off from @entity8 to @entity9 he ended up 4,500 miles away in the @entity10			1
he had been given up as lost by his owner @entity11 , but turned up in good health four weeks later on sun - kissed @entity13			1
well hello there : @entity7 takes a stroll on @entity13 after he took a wrong turn on his trip from @entity8 to @entity19 mr @entity11 , 59 , was astonished to receive a call from a @entity22 woman working on the island with the news that @entity7 was safe , well and enjoying the holiday of a lifetime			1
just how the 16 - month - old bird reached the @entity28 will never be known , but no one believes he flew all the way across the @entity31			2
mr @entity11 , of @entity32 , said : ‘ he must have hitchhiked on a ship to make it over there – and get away from our weather ! ‘ i ’ve heard of people finding their pigeons in @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , but never this far away			1
’ the great adventure began on may 25			0
eight of mr @entity11 ’s pigeons had been taken to @entity49 in @entity8 for the 286 - mile race home			1
‘ when he did n’t arrive back from @entity8 with the rest after about six hours i thought that was that , ’ said mr @entity11 , a catering firm driver			1
@entity57 's journey being looked after : @entity7 the wayward winged pigeon is being held by @entity59 in his new holiday home in the @entity10 @entity62 detective : @entity57 's owner @entity11 with one of his flock , which is missing a certain @entity7 who has decided to holiday to the @entity10 then , in the third week of june , @entity7 flew into a boathouse on @entity13 and presented himself to @entity67 , 30 , who is studying for a phd in fisheries conservation there			1
she said : ‘ he looked in fine shape			0
i knew he was owned by someone as he had the ring on			0
at first we thought it must be someone locally that keeps pigeons and that he would feed up for a few days then move on			2
‘ he started running up to people and around people ’s feet looking for food , and straight away flew on to people ’s hands and shoulders for food			0
’ by coincidence @entity87 ’s father is also a pigeon enthusiast and lives in @entity90 , 60 miles from mr @entity11			0
her father told her how to find the owner ’s phone number embedded into a wing			0
‘ that ’s when we discovered he was from @entity32 , ’ she said			2
@entity7 is enjoying his new home and has been taken under the wing of @entity87 and her fiance @entity59 , 31 , a diving instructor			1
@entity102 : @entity7 's new home in the @entity10 ... ... is a bit different to his @entity32 home ! she said : ‘ he seems really happy , and waits for @entity59 to open up in the morning			1
he starts weaving in and out of his legs and running after @entity59 until he gets out his food			0
‘ then he flies to @entity59 ’s shoulder , and will sit there on his hand to feed			0
‘ he often disappears for half the day , probably exploring , and comes back to relax under the boathouse dock in the shade , and sits and watches everyone loading boats			0
he gets lots of shouts of “ @entity7 ! ” now from the kids			2
’ the pigeon has become a bit of a celebrity			0
‘ in the @entity10 many of the locals have never seen a pigeon like him who is tame , so showing them how he flies to you for food and how to stroke him is exciting for them			2
’ @entity7 may be forced to return home when miss @entity67 flies back to the @entity22 in september , but she added : ‘ it might be nice for him to live out his days in the sunshine on a permanent holiday			1

@entity7 had been shipped out to @entity49 in @entity8 in may for a 286 - mile race back to his home in @entity32
his owner thought he *'d* died when he did *n't* turn up but flew to the @entity10 after hitchhiking on a ship
