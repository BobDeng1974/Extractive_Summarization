out of control : professor dame @entity1 said the willingness of @entity3 to give out drugs was causing the spread of superbugs family doctors are fuelling the spread of superbugs by needlessly ‘ dishing out ’ antibiotics , the country ’s top medical adviser has said			1
professor dame @entity1 accused gps of prescribing powerful drugs to patients who are reluctant to take time off work with minor illnesses			1
she also called for sick animals to be slaughtered rather than treated to prevent a looming crisis in antibiotic resistance			1
@entity20 , the chief medical officer for @entity21 , warned of a growing postcode lottery in which it is twice as easy to get an antibiotics prescription from a gp in @entity26 than in parts of @entity28			1
and she called for a 24 - hour delay in prescriptions to stop people taking the drugs if they do n’t need them			1
speaking at the @entity33 , she said : ‘ there is evidence that some @entity3 are dishing out more than they need to for medical clinical disease			2
‘ we ’ve clearly got it wrong , and i would argue that gps do need more training			0
if we do n’t take action , deaths will go up and up and modern medicine as we know it will be lost			0
’ antibiotics are designed to fight bacteria , but are routinely given for viral infections			0
experts are worried that high usage of antibiotics increases the chances of bacteria becoming resistant to them – fuelling a breed of superbugs such as @entity55 and making illness more difficult to treat in the long term			1
last year @entity20 asked the government to put antibiotic resistance on the national risk register – ranking it alongside a large - scale terrorist attack or flu pandemic			2
she warned that without action we may return to a ‘ 19th - century environment ’ within 20 years , in which routine operations such as transplants carry a deadly risk because of the risk of untreatable infections			1
about 35million antibiotic prescriptions are given out by doctors in @entity21 every year			1
the biggest prescribers are in western @entity26 , where one in 12 patients were given the medication in 2012			1
that is twice as many as the lowest , in @entity77 , north @entity28 , where one in 25 received a prescription the same year			1
@entity20 said : ‘ you ca n’t tell me that in @entity82 they ’ve got more sick people , more than double , than in @entity77			2
' so there ’s something about prescribing practice			0
’ statistics reveal a pronounced north - south divide in prescribing rates , with 69 per cent of northern areas prescribing more than the national average , compared with 39 per cent of those in the south			2
over the counter : experts are worried that high usage of antibiotics increases the chances of bacteria becoming resistant to them ( file picture ) ' @entity20 said patients often pressure @entity3 to dish out prescriptions , and called for more @entity103 ’ guidelines have advised against giving antibiotics for coughs and colds since 1998			1
] # ' but the government ’s own research has shown antibiotics are prescribed for up to 80 per cent of such minor ailments – despite being more likely to be caused by a virus than a bacteria			0
dame @entity20 said : ‘ it is very difficult for @entity3			2
they get patients coming and saying , “ i ’ve got an ear infection ” , or more often “ my child has an infection ”			0
they say , “ give me an antibiotic so i can go to work ”			0
mass : around one in 16 people in @entity123 are prescribed antibiotics each year ‘ i do n’t beat @entity3 up because i think it ’s very difficult when you ’re faced with a mother who is very anxious with a sick child with a high temperature			2
’ she also called for a cut in the use of antibiotics in farm animals , one of the biggest causes of resistance to the drugs			1
controversially , she urged vets to slaughter sick animals rather than give them antibiotics to help them recover			0
she said : ‘ i had a bit of a problem with some vets recently because i said , “ why do n’t you just slaughter animals when they ’re badly infected ? ” it seems to me much better because then they ca n’t transmit them [ antibiotics ]			0
‘ at the moment , if you eat a farmed salmon in @entity153 it has probably eaten its own weight in antibiotics			0
’ @entity20 called for the adoption of a delayed prescription system for patients , to drive down use of drugs			1
she said : ‘ the doctor writes the prescription and hands it to the parents and says , “ if your child is still sick in 24 hours and has n’t improved , go and get your prescription			1
” ’ she also accused drugs companies of failing to invest in developing new antibiotics , because ‘ they do n’t make a profit ’			2
no new class of antibiotic has been discovered since 1987			0
in contrast , a new infection emerges on an almost yearly basis			0
she added : ‘ i ’m really worried about this			0
this is like climate change			0
we are doing it to ourselves and we could die of it if we do n’t do something now			0
’ around one in 16 people in @entity123 are prescribed antibiotics each year			2
doctors have been advised not to give patients antibiotics for minor illnesses since 1998 , but @entity190 research suggests the drugs are prescribed for up to 80 per cent of coughs , colds and sore @entity195 resistance occurs when bacteria adapt to survive the medicines intended to destroy them			1
standard treatments become ineffective and infections persist , increasing risk of spreading to others			0
high doses of the drugs – whether for humans or animals – increase the problem by accelerating the speed at which bacteria adapt			0
resistance to the drugs has led to the rise of superbugs against which there is no treatment , such as @entity55 and clostridium difficile			1
@entity20 warns that within 20 years it may be impossible to fight common infections , making routine operations dangerous			0
but critics claim that so - called ‘ antibiotic prohibitionists ’ such as @entity20 are making it harder for patients to get the drugs they need .			1
