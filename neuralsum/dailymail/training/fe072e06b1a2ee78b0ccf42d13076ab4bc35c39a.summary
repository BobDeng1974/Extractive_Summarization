destroyed : @entity7 , 49 , left a huge hole in @entity3 's @entity10 with a @entity12 ( 1874 ) evidence : the jury saw cctv which showed @entity7 raising his arm just before the painting was ruined but a witness told @entity26 his movement was a ' lunge ' and @entity7 's fist had gone straight through the painting like a ' hammer '			1
and the court heard @entity7 had 48 previous convictions , including for handling stolen maps worth £ 5,000 which dated to 1651			2
a jury of seven woman and five men was told how @entity7 walked into the gallery just before 11am on june 29 , 2012			1
he walked over to the @entity3 painting to look at it before disappearing , coming back and launching the attack - which was captured on @entity22			1
instead of his clenched hand falling low on the painting , it made contact above his eyeline - meaning he would have had to raise his arm , the court heard			2
security staff and two horrified tourists from @entity50 helped call an ambulance after @entity7 told them he had unstable angina			0
jailed : @entity7 ( pictured ) told police he had unstable angina and later underwent a quadruple heart bypass - but a jury found him guilty of damaging the painting after an eight - day trial at @entity26 he was treated by a paramedic who administered a glyceryl trinitrate spray and aspirin			1
despite the medical crew finding he was in a safe condition , he was taken to hospital where he was released the same day and interviewed by police			0

but tourist @entity69 told the eight - day trial he had seen a man with a clenched fist put it straight into the @entity3			1
he said he grabbed the man , who said something like he felt faint , and moved him into the middle of the room to get him away from the paintings			0
mr @entity69 ' wife @entity78 added she was standing beside her husband when she saw an arm appear and a fist go through the @entity3			2
she said it was like a ' hammer ' and described the movement as a lunge			0
restored : the painting has since been returned to its original state - but many fragments were lost forever good as new : experts point out the meticulous work on the painting , likened to microscopic needlework police also found a tin of paint stripper in mr @entity7 ’s bag - but the judge later concluded it was for his job as a @entity100 polisher			1
consultant surgeon @entity101 told the court that in july 2013 , after he had been in prison for almost a year , mr @entity7 underwent a quadruple heart bypass because he had a 90 per cent blockage in three vessels of the heart			2
but the surgeon said he would expect only one in 100 people with the condition to have dizzy spells , and if he fell down he would normally have remained unconscious rather than getting up			0
judge @entity113 , who directed the jury to find @entity7 not guilty of damaging two more paintings at @entity9 's @entity117 hotel , said the 49 - year - old must have known the painting was valuable			1
he added it was a ' peculiar crime ' and it was ' abnormal ' for @entity7 to cause as much damage as he did			0

masterpiece : painted in 1874 when @entity3 was working from a boat on the @entity132 , @entity10 with a @entity12 is the only work by the renowned impressionist which is in the @entity136 national art collection a previous jury in the case had been discharged last december after failing to reach a verdict			1
the artwork was ripped apart in a devastating three - branch tear and was finally restored this year following a painstaking 18 - month restoration			0
laid end to end , the tears would have been about a foot long in an artwork less than four feet square			0
conservationists removed the painting from its frame and delicately sewed together thousands of fine threads which made up the canvas			0
seven per cent of the pieces of the @entity3 - the only work by the artist in @entity136 's national collection - could not be saved , some splitting into powdery dust			1
@entity159 , director of the @entity8 of @entity136 , likened the meticulous repair to microscopic needlework			2
' it was huge damage , shocking damage , ' he said			0
' this project to restore and conserve one of the gallery 's most popular impressionist works of art is testament to the outstanding expertise and dedication of our professional team of conservators			2
' the 55cm by 65cm oil painting , created when @entity3 used a boat as a floating studio on the @entity132 , is now behind protective glass with ultraviolet filtering and humidity controls .			0
