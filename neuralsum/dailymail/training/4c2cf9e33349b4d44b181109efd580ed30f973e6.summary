it was a sight that must rank among the more unlikely in cricket history			0
there was @entity3 trotting out at the @entity4 to join the @entity6 team for the first time since limping into @entity9 immortality at the @entity10 almost six years ago			1
back then any thoughts of a comeback , let alone an appearance in an @entity6 shirt , were outlandish for an iconic figure whose body gave up on him during that 2009 summer when he left the field for the final time as an @entity9 winner			0
yet there he was on sunday , larger than life , back training among a new generation of @entity6 players , many of whom would have grown up watching him at his peak when the fabled 2005 @entity9 gripped the nation			0
former @entity6 cricketer @entity3 bowls during a nets session at @entity4 @entity3 chats to bowler @entity33 during their training session at @entity4 it will not lead to a playing return for his country , of course , and @entity3 restricted himself to barely half an hour ’s bowling at just @entity41 and @entity42 during his day back with the @entity6 team at @entity45 invitation			1
but if this is to be the end of @entity3 ’s sojourn back into the game – and he has hinted that he may not return to @entity50 this summer after finishing his @entity52 stint with @entity53 – then it was not the worst way to bow out			0
@entity6 intended @entity3 ’s day among them to be a low - key affair and the first of a number of visits from past greats aimed , as is the wont of @entity61 under @entity62 , at encouraging a bit of star dust to rub off on the team			1
but such is the enduring appeal of the man known as @entity3 that all eyes were on him as he donned mitts to assist with a boxing training exercise and then took up his position at the back of the nets , passing on advice to @entity6 ’s bowlers			1
‘ i ’m just here as a net bowler , ’ said @entity3 , as he declined an invitation to talk about how he came to be back in @entity6 ’s colours and it was left to @entity45 , who worked with @entity3 during his first stint as @entity6 coach , to explain			1
‘ it ’s nice to get players who have been brilliant with @entity6 back among the squad , ’ said @entity45			2
‘ the game has moved on but it has also stayed the same in many ways and it was just great to have @entity3 around			0
@entity3 holds pads as @entity90 of @entity6 boxes in preparation for their nets session @entity3 has joined the camp to pass on his experience to the younger members of the @entity6 team @entity99 takes a turn on the pads with @entity3 before their session in the nets @entity3 appeared to enjoy his time back training with the @entity6 squad ‘ this squad are very keen to connect with some of those who have been there and done it with @entity6 because it can only help them			2
’ @entity3 restricted himself to chatting with the likes of @entity41 and bowling coach @entity111 at first during net practice while @entity33 went through an extended bowling session that appeared to confirm his fitness for tuesday ’s tri-series match here against @entity117			1
but the man who has made only a modest impact with a @entity121 team who have now been knocked out of this year ’s @entity52 could not resist a bit of a trundle after passing on some advice to @entity126 , who looked a detached figure and seems sure to be the bowler to miss out when @entity33 returns			0
@entity3 beat the edge of @entity131 ’s bat a couple of times and was also respected by @entity134 when he had a net before an extended @entity6 training session came to an end in @entity53 ’s sweltering heat			2
he joined the team at a barbeque here last night before rejoining his family on the @entity142 where @entity3 has based himself while making a very positive impression – perhaps more off - field than on it – on the @entity52			0
the @entity6 players seemed to enjoy having @entity3 among them and @entity3 certainly seemed to enjoy it himself			2
it was certainly nice for all concerned while it lasted			0
