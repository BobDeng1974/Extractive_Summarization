by @entity0 published : 05:38 est , 2 november 2012 updated : 07:58 est , 2 november 2012 peering nervously out of its shell for a first glimpse at the world , this turtle , not much bigger than a 50p piece , is part of a breeding programme that will hopefully help save its species			1
once common along the @entity11 of @entity12 , the @entity10 turtle has all but disappeared from @entity13 and is threatened in the @entity14 and @entity15 by river dams , invasive plants , draining of wetland and its natural predators			1
but these latest additions , born at @entity21 , give hope that their decline can be reversed			1
hello , world : this @entity26 hatches from his egg at @entity21 , where a two - decade breeding programme is underway to help save the species miniscule : this little turtle is barely bigger than a coin			1
out in the wild , it would have been extremely vulnerable to predators at this size they are the result of a 20 - year breeding programme aimed at restoring the species to its previous levels			1
although the turtles can live until the age of 70 , they do n't begin to breed until they 're 10			2
but with the turtles endangered in @entity48 and threatened in @entity21 - and populations greatly reduced and concentrated elsewhere - it can be hard to find a mate			1
this little turtle measures just a few centimetres and weighs a few ounces but once fully grown , they can reach six to eight inches long and weigh up to 2.4 pounds			0
trouble is , they grow very slowly and so are extremely vulnerable to predators out in the wild			0
but these turtles will be given a fighting chance as they 'll be looked after at the zoo until the spring and then tracked by electronic transmitter			0
endangered : western pond turtle populations on @entity12 's @entity11 have dwindled to just a few hundred in some areas endangered : western pond turtle populations on @entity12 's @entity11 have dwindled to just a few hundred in some areas the zoo has released 1,500 turtles over the past two decades , with encouraging results - the @entity70 turtle population rose from a low of 150 in 1990 to approximately 1,500 in 2011			1
experts predict that 95 per cent of those turtles released back into the @entity70 have survived			0
the @entity26 can prove very elusive as they rapidly dive from their basking sites into deep water when approached by humans			0
they 're often found hidden under submerged rocks and logs , in deep silt or in beaver borrows and lodges			0
tiny friends : the zoo 's previous preservation efforts have been successful , with populations of other turtle species rising ten fold helping hand : once big enough , the zoo will release the little turtles back into the wild			2
some will be fitted with electronic trackers to monitor population levels these omnivores eat insects , crayfish and other aquatic invertebrates , as well as the occasional fish , tadpole or frog			0
females deposit clutches of 5 - 13 eggs once or twice a year and can travel as far as half a mile and up to 300ft above the nearest source of water for egg - laying			2
the females spend a considerable amount of time covering up their nest and soil with vegetation to make it harder for predators to find the eggs .			0

@entity121 , little bigger than a coin , hatch at @entity21 as part of 20 - year programme to save severely endangered species
the turtles , once prevalent from @entity13 down the @entity11 to @entity15 , have dwindled to *record* low levels
