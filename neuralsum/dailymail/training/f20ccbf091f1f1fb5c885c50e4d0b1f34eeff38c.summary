@entity0 has backed the @entity1 support to rally to the cause if the off - field turmoil at @entity4 takes another turn for the worse			1
the club 's board was forced to call an emergency share issue earlier this month as they sought to plug a £ 4million black - hole in their budget			1
they fell £ 900,000 of their target and will now be forced to turn to investors again before the year is out			1
@entity1 midfielder @entity0 addresses the media at @entity16 @entity1 players train at @entity16 on monday morning after their 1 - 1 draw at @entity19 on saturday however , chief executive @entity20 met with @entity21 , his players and members of the @entity26 giants ' backroom staff on friday to reassure them that the club was not in imminent danger			1
but that has done little to placate angry supporters , who have already called for football board chairman @entity32 to be sacked			2
around 15,000 of the club 's followers have also refused to renew their season tickets in protest at the way the club is being run			1
even so , @entity0 believes the @entity4 faithful will not allow the club to be put in danger again			1
the former @entity41 midfielder - who was forced to take up a part - time job as a painter and decorator during @entity46 's chaotic spell as @entity41 owner - said : ' these off - field matters can be distracting if it goes too far and gets to the situation when you do n't get paid			2
that 's when it certainly affects you			0
manager @entity21 , who has managed the club since 2011 , speaks to the press on monday @entity1 ' fans will not let the club sink , according to midfielder @entity0 ' but it 's not going to get to that stage			1
it 's too big a club			2
the fans have helped out and stood by us through thick and thin			0
they wo n't let us go into that situation			0
' the board have told us as it stands it is going to be fine			0
we ca n't affect that so i do n't want to pay any attention to things that will interfere with my performances			0
' @entity72 also addressed the club 's staff at last week 's meeting and insisted he and @entity20 were delivering a positive message			1
' @entity20 met with everybody - not just the players , ' he explained			1
' we had a staff meeting at @entity4 , which we have been known to have in the past , and it involved the staff from the stadium , the players and a lot of the staff from @entity16			2
' i did read somewhere that it was a secret meeting			0
it was not a secret meeting , that 's for sure			2
all the staff knew about it and were going to it			0
@entity20 addressed the staff , as did i for five or 10 minutes			2
that 's all there was to it			0
' there was nothing at all said that would scare anybody			0
' we just wanted to keep everybody informed of what the plans and hopes are for the future and i would safely say it was very beneficial			0
@entity1 manager @entity21 ( right ) enjoys a joke at training on monday @entity111 celebrates after scoring the equaliser for @entity1 in their 1 - 1 draw with @entity19 on saturday ' it was n't so much that people wanted reassurance			1
they just wanted information and a chat about what direction the club was going			0
' it was nothing more than that and it was a good idea			0
it 's something @entity20 is keen to do again in future			1
' @entity21 was speaking just hours after @entity1 confirmed to the @entity128 that the stake held by @entity130 in the club had fallen from 4.56 per cent to 3.68 per cent			1
the @entity133 owner decided against taking part in the open offer - which raised £ 3.13million after 15.6 million new shares were sold - meaning his holding was diluted			2
he does , however , retain three million shares			0
investment group @entity139 strengthened their stance as @entity1 ' single biggest stakeholder after buying up more than five million shares			1
they now control just over 13 million shares - or around 16.3 per cent of the club			2
meanwhile , @entity0 has urged his team - mates to shake off saturday 's sloppy display against @entity19			1
@entity1 could only draw 1 - 1 with @entity148 's part - times at the @entity149 but now travel to @entity150 on tuesday looking to claim a @entity152 quarter - final slot			1
@entity0 said : ' we came off the game against @entity155 last week buzzing that we had knocked out a top - flight team , so it was disappointing the way we started against @entity19			0
' we picked up in the second half but obviously we have come in and we 've spoke about it , we know what we did wrong and where we can improve			0
we 're ready to go again and the gaffer 's got us sorted			0
' @entity0 has praised the @entity1 fans , and says they will not let the club die @entity165 ( right ) appeals to the referee after his @entity1 goal is chalked off , for offside			1
