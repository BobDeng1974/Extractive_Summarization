the great @entity2 people are wrong about almost everything , a new poll reveals today			1
from religion to age , jobs to pregnancy , what people think about the country and the reality are wildly different			1
a new survey by @entity13 shows the public think immigration , teenage pregnancies and unemployment are all much higher than reality , while they underestimate the number of @entity21 in the @entity2 and turnout at elections			1
it concludes : ' in @entity33 we get a lot of things very wrong			0
' for example , people think that as many as one in six ( 16 per cent ) teenage girls aged 15 - 19 give birth each year , when the true figure is just 3 per cent			1
people also think we will live longer than reality suggests , expecting a baby born in 2014 to live to 83 , when official forecasts predict only 80			1
repeated warnings about an ageing population have led us to think that 37 per cent of people are aged 65 or over , when the true figure is less than half : just 17 per cent			2
immigration has become the dominat political theme , with @entity52 josliting with other party leaders to show he has the toughest approach			2
but the problem might not be as serious as some think			0
@entity2 believe that almost a quarter – some 24 per cent - of the population are immigrants – which is almost double twice the true figure of 13 per cent , the poll found			2
the social make - up of the @entity2 is also different to the public perception			0
for example , we ' hugely over-estimate ' the proportion of @entity65 in @entity33 , believing one in five @entity2 people are @entity65 ( 21 per cent ) when the actual figure is 5 per cent ( one in twenty ) , @entity63 said			0
at the same time we underestimate the proportion of @entity21 , believing that 39 per cent of the country identify themselves as @entity21 compared with the true figure of 59 per cent			1
unemployment has fallen dramatically in recent months to just 7 per cent , with record numbers of people now in work			0
but the public still thinks that 24 per cent of the working age population do not have a job			0
and on elections , on average people think just 49 per cent turned out for the 2010 general election , when turnout was actually much higher at 66 per cent			1
@entity87 , managing director of @entity88 , said : ' these misperceptions present clear issues for informed public debate and policy - making			0
for example , public priorities may well be different if we had a clearer view of the scale of immigration and the real incidence of teenage mothers			1
' people also under - estimate ' positive ' behaviours like voting , which may be important if people think it is more ' normal ' not to vote than it actually is			0
' this is the first international study to look at these misperceptions across a range of issues and countries – and it shows the @entity2 are far from alone in being wrong			0
' in fact we 're among the better informed countries – but there are still huge gaps between perceptions and reality on a number of key issues in @entity33			2

new poll reveals the vast gap between what the public think and reality
people *overestimate* *levels* of teenage pregnancies and immigration
survey shows we underestimate number of @entity21 and election turnout
