mr @entity4 , 60 , said : ‘ we were surprised to see them so close in to the coastline , but the warmer weather is causing a lot of change in the seas			0
‘ the following day a diving colleague of ours saw some of the sharks in at three miles , and they were in a very large group of nine			1
‘ we made sure we wore black diving gloves , as these sharks can often mistake white gloves for fish , which is when you could end up losing a hand			0
‘ swimmers are n’t in danger from these sharks			0
they are highly unlikely to bite humans			0
‘ these sharks were over two metres long , but one of them swam off when it got a jellyfish sting on the nose			0

i think the shark thought it was a bit of mackerel and went in too close			2
