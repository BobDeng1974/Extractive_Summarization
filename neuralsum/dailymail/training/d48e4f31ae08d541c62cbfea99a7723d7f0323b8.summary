@entity9 is pushing the boundaries of the art world by using a selection of dyed soy milk in a mixture of colours which she then swallows before vomiting onto a white canvas but despite the regular retching , @entity9 , 27 , insists it does n’t affect her health			1

@entity9 said ' i do n’t eat for two days prior to performing so that i clean my stomach of any food , that way the only liquid that comes up is beautiful and of pure colour			2
' i can drink anything from one pint to four litres depending on if i ’m doing a live performance or creating a canvas piece			2
@entity9 aims to regurgitate the liquid as pure colour and drinks each glass of dye one glass at a time she starves herself for two days before each performance to clear her stomach - but maintains she is still healthy ' it 's definitely not recommended to put your body through this but i ¿ m generally a healthy person so i feel like that balances out the rest , ' she says @entity9 , who grew up in a @entity92 family , follows a vegan diet and only does a performance each month ' i time each drink so that each colour does n’t mix in my stomach and try to space out my performances so that my body can recover properly			1
' it ’s very much about timing , i find the whole process fascinating and the long meditative fast can be very inspiring			0
' i often set out with an idea of what i ’d like to create but i enjoy the uncontrollable element of my work and just go with it			0
' filming can be exhausting , it can be an entire day of vomiting which leaves you with migraines but generally i feel good after performing , it ’s like a cleanse for your body and mind			0

' there have been so many different reactions to my work , from laughing to crying , love and even death threats but i think art is made to make you feel and as long as it makes you feel something it can be powerful			0
' it ’s definitely not recommended to put your body through this but i ’m generally a healthy person so i feel like that balances out the rest			0
' born in @entity177 to @entity92 parents and spending much of her youth in @entity182 and the @entity183 , it is clear where @entity9 ’s maverick tendencies originated			0
