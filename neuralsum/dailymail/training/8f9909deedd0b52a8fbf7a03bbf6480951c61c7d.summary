an inquest earlier this month determined the feeding tube was wrongly inserted into the newborn 's heart			1
@entity38 's @entity37 who run the hospital , have since said that they have compiled a comprehensive action plan to improve training given to neonatal staff on the correct insertion of long lines , in a bid to avoid a similar tragedy			0
miss @entity2 said : ' i appreciate that lessons have been learned by the hospital , i hope this never happens again - no mother should go through what i went through			1
' i have to deal with the fact that if it was n't for a simple oversight , @entity1 would be with us now			1
' nothing will ever bring back my only baby daughter - her death will be with me for life			0
' while pregnant , @entity22 , who has five sons , was delighted to find out that she was to give birth to her first daughter			0
but just 28 weeks into her pregnancy @entity22 was rushed to hospital after suddenly going into labour			2
medics found her son was in the breech position , while her daughter was facing backwards , and rushed @entity22 into the operating theatre to undergo an emergency caesarean section			0

@entity1 was the smaller of the two , weighing less than a kilogram			0
they were both incubated and fed by a long line - a tube used to feed babies that do not yet have working intestines			0

' both were breathing on their own and doctors were positive they 'd pull through			0
' nine days after the twins ' traumatic birth @entity22 , who was still staying in the hospital for treatment for an infection caused by the emergency caesarean , was called to the neonatal ward			2
miss @entity2 said : ' i was nodding off in my hospital bed when a nurse told me i needed to get myself to their ward fast			2
' when i got there , i found medics frantically working on @entity1			0
a short while later , a doctor delivered the devastating bombshell - my daughter had stopped breathing and died			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity38 's @entity37 , which runs @entity20 , said : ' @entity118 are extremely sorry for the distress caused to the family as a result of the failings in care provided to @entity1			1
' we have apologised in writing to @entity22 and extended our deepest sympathies on her very sad loss			0
' the clinicians involved in @entity1 's care were in early contact with the coroner following her death and have co-operated at every stage with ongoing inquest proceedings			1
' a full internal investigation into @entity1 's death was commissioned as soon as the post mortem results were available			1
' as a result of this we have implemented a comprehensive action plan , including producing clear guidance on the safe insertion of long lines and improving the training of staff to ensure their correct positioning			0
' miss @entity2 demanded a post-mortem after she received conflicting reports about the cause of her daughter 's death			1
she said : ' my mum arrived at the hospital to support me but was astonished when a doctor explained that her granddaughter had suffered a heart attack			0
' i 'd been told @entity1 had stopped breathing , it did n't stack up			0
' desperate for answers , we pushed for a post mortem which revealed a doctor had pierced @entity1 's heart cavity with the long line			1
' an inquest two weeks ago determined that the line was incorrectly inserted into @entity1 by a doctor in his first year of speciality training			2
the misplaced line caused cardiac tamponade , a rare condition where fluid builds up around the heart			1
it was found that this , coupled with @entity1 's prematurity , caused her death			1
at the inquest at @entity180 on june 11 , coroner dr @entity178 recorded a narrative verdict saying she had no doubt that the line was incorrectly positioned			0
miss @entity2 said : ' the inquest showed that no senior doctor had picked up on the mistake for over five days			1
' @entity186 had cost me my only little girl			0
' the hospital have since apologised but as far as i 'm concerned it is n't enough			0
' i 'm so lucky to have @entity6 but some days he looks so much like his twin sister it breaks my heart			2
' even now , two years on , i 'm terrified to let him sleep in case he does n't wake up			0
' i am pleased the hospital are trying to stop this from ever happening again but i 'm not happy that nobody has been punished for their mistakes			0
' following the inquest this month , i have decided that i need some time to grieve before possibly taking further action			0
