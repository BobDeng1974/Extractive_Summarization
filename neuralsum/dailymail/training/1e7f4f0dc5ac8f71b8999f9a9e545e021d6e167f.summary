@entity1 owner @entity0 has accused the @entity2 of attempting to ' kill ' the beleaguered @entity4 side			1
the @entity5 had his appeal against being disqualified as a director dismissed on monday after a @entity8 ( @entity8 ) rejected @entity10 's appeal after deciding his tax evasion conviction in @entity5 was an offence of dishonesty			1
as a result the 58 - year - old has to step down as director , cut ties with @entity1 and not partake in any significant influence over the club until april 10 , when his conviction becomes spent under @entity22 law			1
@entity0 ( centre ) watches @entity1 play @entity24 at @entity25 with the away fans back in september ' they cheated			1
we got there and we were not able to fight , ' @entity0 told the @entity30 ' we did not expect it to be arbitration			2
we expected a court , where you can challenge and put in your case			0
' this was an ambush			0
it was a three - man panel , all three from the @entity2 , ' added @entity0			2
' @entity38 are trying to hurt the club , that 's my only conclusion			0
the club will not fall apart because i 'm stepping away			0
' @entity0 is evidently furious that he failed the @entity2 's fit and proper person test in december due to his conviction for tax evasion in @entity5 : ' they say i am not fit and proper but i have put more than £ 30million of my own money into this club and i 'm not here to make quick money for myself			1
when i arrived we were more than £ 55m in debt			0
now the debt is £ 13m , i have cleaned this club			2
' @entity0 's appeal against the decision to disqualify him from owning @entity1 has been rejected @entity0 ( right , pictured in april 2014 ) and @entity1 said they were ' surprised and disappointed ' with the decision in its judgement the @entity8 stated on monday : ' we consider that the judge 's findings of fact and her description of mr @entity0 's state of mind based on them , is of conduct which would reasonably be considered to be dishonest			1
' we therefore conclude that mr @entity0 has been convicted of an offence involving a ' @entity67 ' within the meaning of the rules , and that he is accordingly subject to a ' @entity70 '			2
' as a result of this decision , @entity0 is disqualified from acting as a ' @entity73 ' , as defined by @entity2 regulations until 10th april 2015			1
' on the pitch , @entity1 have not won since december , despite a late equaliser against @entity77 on saturday in a statement on the @entity1 website , @entity0 and the club made a short comment on monday 's decision : ' mr @entity0 would like to thank the fans , sponsors and members of the wider footballing community that have given him overwhelming support , not just since the disqualifying order was issued but since he arrived at the club			1
' we are surprised and disappointed by the verdict , however we are continuing to take legal advice			0
' we will release further statements in due course			0
' a @entity8 ( @entity95 ) chaired by @entity96 has rejected an appeal by @entity1 president @entity0 against the recent decision by the @entity99 that he is subject to a disqualifying condition under its owners ' and @entity102			1
the @entity8 found that the reasoned judgment of the @entity5 court , once it had become available , was for an act involving dishonesty as determined by the @entity99 in its original ruling in march 2014			2
mr. @entity0 's appeal against that original decision had been upheld on the basis that it could not be concluded that the offence necessarily involved a ' @entity67 ' for the purposes of the @entity102			1
once the reasoned judgment became available , the @entity99 considered the matter again and concluded that it clearly demonstrated that mr. @entity0 's offence did indeed involve acts that would reasonably be considered to be dishonest			0
in its judgment , dismissing mr @entity0 's appeal against the decision , the @entity8 states : ' we consider that the judge 's findings of fact and her description of mr. @entity0 's state of mind based on them , is of conduct which would reasonably be considered to be dishonest			2
we therefore conclude that @entity127 has been convicted of an offence involving a ' @entity67 ' within the meaning of the rules , and that he is accordingly subject to a ' @entity70 '			0
as are result of this decision , @entity0 is disqualified from acting as a ' @entity73 ' , as defined by @entity2 regulations until 10th april 2015			1
the @entity2 will provide any assistance requested by @entity1 to help it minimise , as far as possible , the effect this decision has on the club while mr. @entity0 serves his period of disqualification			1
a @entity2 spokesman said : ' the @entity2 's sole objective throughout this process has been to ensure that our regulations , as democratically approved by our member clubs , are complied with			0
these regulations uphold principles relating to club ownership that are widely recognised to be in the interests of the game and have the support of the other football authorities , the @entity154 and football supporters generally			0
' the constitution of the @entity8 was agreed between the two parties ahead of last week 's hearing and @entity2 would like to thank @entity96 and the other members of the panel for their time			0
in addition , a further misconduct charge against mr. @entity10 for failing to supply the @entity5 @entity104 judgment to @entity2 when it first became available will be heard by a @entity165 in line with @entity2 regulations in due course .			0

@entity0 had been disqualified from being allowed to run @entity1 after a tax evasion conviction in @entity5
@entity0 and @entity1 appealed the decision but it has been rejected
the @entity1 owner will now have to step down as director , cut ties with @entity1 and agree not to have a significant influence until april 10
@entity0 claims to have invested £ 30million of his own money into the club
