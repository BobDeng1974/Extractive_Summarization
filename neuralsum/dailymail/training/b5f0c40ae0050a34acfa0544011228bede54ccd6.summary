@entity2 's @entity1 group has banned samosas after ruling the popular snacks are ' offensive ' and too @entity5			1
militant @entity7 fighters last week used vehicles mounted with loudspeakers to announce the bizarre ruling across the regions of the war - torn country it controls			1
the extremist group has offered no official explanation for the ban on the triangular snacks , which are commonly cooked up and served across the @entity19			1
' offensive ' : the samosa is said upset militant islamists due to a supposed resemblance to the @entity24 the bizarre ban comes just days after militants linked to @entity27 in @entity2 refused to let some aid workers into the country as tens of thousands suffered in the nation 's massive famine			1
aid groups including the @entity34 say they were not given permission by militants to provide aid in the country , where it has been warned that 800,000 children could die from starvation			1
it is now thought islamist militants have taken offence at the three - sided samosa 's supposed resemblance to symbol of the @entity24			1
@entity49 's @entity48 newspaper today reported that residents of the @entity2 town of @entity52 , 20 miles south of the capital @entity54 , had confirmed the samosa ban had been imposed			1
the fried snacks , usually filled with spicy meat or vegetables , have been served for centuries in the @entity61 country			2
but the newspaper said locals believed @entity1 leaders had decided the triangular shape was not compatible with their strict version of @entity67			1
the unexpected move means @entity2 could now expect to be punished if caught cooking , buying or eating samosas , known locally as sambusas			2
the ban is the latest in a string of authoritarian rulings introduced by @entity1 , a violent @entity7 organisation linked to @entity27 and classified by several countries as a terrorist group			2
the word ' samosa ' derives from the @entity80 ' sanbosag '			2
it is referred to as ' sambusak ' or a similar variation in most parts of the arabic - speaking world			2
the snack is thought to have originated in @entity86 before the 10th century and was introduced to the @entity88 subcontinent around 1300 by traders in the region			1
records from the 14th century describe a ' small pie stuffed with minced meat , almonds , pistachio , walnuts and spices ' , served before the third course			2
the snack , popular in @entity100 for centuries , then gained popularity when bought to @entity88 by @entity104 traders and soldiers			1
the crispy meat - filled samosa made today was then made around campfires and saved by travelers as snacks for long journeys			0
the extremist army has taken command of several provinces of @entity2 and is fighting the country 's official government for total control			0
however it has been widely criticised for its strict enforcement of @entity120 law and unmerciful treatment of the population			0
resemblance : islamic militants say samosas look like the @entity24 at the weekend the organisation sparked outrage after saying it would refuse to allow overseas aid agencies into drought - hit parts of @entity2			1
the @entity34 last week declared a famine in two parts of the country and warned millions face death from starvation			0
@entity1 had previously suggested it would allow foreign agencies to bring in vital food aid to prevent its people from dying			0
but on friday the group denied the famine even existed and accused @entity142 governments of inventing the crisis as a propaganda tool			0
the organisation also warned foreign agencies were still banned in the regions of @entity2 it controlled			0
experts have warned the group 's refusal to acknowledge the food crisis could cause millions of unnecessary deaths as people struggle to find food amid a devastating drought			0
the reported ban on samosas is the latest in a string of bizarre rulings from the organisation , which has been likened to the @entity161 @entity160			0
earlier this year the group introduced a blanket ban on the playing or watching of football			0
it has also previously ordered men to grow beards and warned it will take action against anyone caught wearing tight - fitting clothes			0
not allowed : samosas have been banned in many small towns near the @entity2 capital of @entity54			0
