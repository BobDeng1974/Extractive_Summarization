the former @entity0 who filmed a porn video in the school 's library has launched a sugar daddy dating site for broke college girls			1
@entity7 , 19 , of @entity8 , @entity9 , writes on the site , called date @entity11 , ' i created this site to match college girls like me who are struggling to pay for school and looking for a rich older boyfriend			1
' i ’m personally a member of the sugar dating community , and have seen the benefits these relationships provide a young woman firsthand			0
everyone benefits from having a mentor that can help you navigate challenges , especially ones they ’ve overcome themselves – like managing student debts and starting a career			0
' it is the also the first site of its kind to be run by a ' sugar baby			0
' this after @entity26 made a video last october for the site @entity65 , and in it was seen topless at times and also touching herself , all while students walked around her in the school library , completely unaware of the young woman 's video			1
then , in january , someone uploaded the video to the popular site @entity75 , making @entity26 an instant celebrity in the adult film world as the video received close to 300,000 views in just a few days before being taken down			1
and while her parents may be upset and the young woman was cited with public indecency , @entity7 is hoping the hype around her library escapades is just what she needs to launch a modelling career			2
@entity26 became well known for the porn video she shot at the @entity88 ( above ) in october @entity26 ( above ) hopes that the hype around the video will help her to launch a modelling career the idea to start doing videos on @entity65 , which features women doing live webcam shows in which they can make money as viewers tip them with virtual tokens they buy from the site , came after @entity101 could not find a waitressing job near campus			1
she did her first webcam video in october , and in an hour had made $ 150 - and earned plenty of compliments			1
' working a minimum wage job , there ’s people that are just mean to you when they ’re having a crappy day , ' she told the @entity112			0
' on @entity65 , [ users ] had nothing but nice things to say			0
and i made way more than i would working any other job			0
' she started making videos regularly at her home while her roommates were out , including one in which she had sex with a former boyfriend , and then , at the suggestion of one of the site 's users , decided to take her show to a public place			0
that is when she made the library video , which earned her $ 700 for about an hour , and within a few weeks she had made the decision to drop out of college and focus on making videos for the site			2
then , in january , she was sitting in her room when she began getting a barrage of friend requests from ' frat boys , ' and then , after checking the gossip app @entity142 , learned that everyone was talking about the ' library girl			2
' her mother also began receiving messages around that time as well , as concerned friends started asking about her daughter , and while there was some relief @entity7 explains when her mother learned she had just filmed a video and had not been hurt , the mother still told her daughter ; ' this is just something you can learn a lesson from and move on			2
' that is not what @entity26 intends to do however , a decision that has now made her parents ' upset ' she reveals , as the offers are not pouring in for the young woman , and she just completed her first professional photo shoot			1
one thing people will not be seeing @entity26 do anymore however is webcam shows on @entity65 - the site has now banned her for violating their guidelines with her library clip			0
she is also banned from the @entity0 campus and last week was arrested and cited with public indecency before being released			0
as for how the video made its way to @entity75 , @entity26 says she has ' no clue			1

@entity7 , 19 , of @entity8 , @entity9 , filmed a webcam video in the @entity179 in which she was topless and touching herself
now she is launching a sugar daddy dating site for broke college girls called date @entity11
@entity26 's video was made in october and then uploaded to the popular site @entity75 in january , receiving almost 300,000 views in just days
@entity26 reveals that while her parents are ' upset ' that their daughter is now known as ' library girl , ' she thinks this could be her big break
she has already done a professional photo shoot and says that she has also received *numerous* other offers in the past week
