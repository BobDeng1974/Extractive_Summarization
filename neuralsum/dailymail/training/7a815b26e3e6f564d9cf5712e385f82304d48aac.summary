@entity0 has been dropped from the @entity2 shortlist at a gay magazine 's award ceremony because of its sponsorship of the @entity6			1
the company had been listed alongside the likes of @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 for the out in the @entity14 and @entity15 award , which is given for promoting diversity and equality			1
however its involvement in the @entity20 , which are being held in @entity21 which passed a law banning homosexual ' propaganda ' last year , has lead to it being dropped			1
@entity0 has been embarrassed by a web glitch which means users of one of its websites are banned from writing @entity29 or @entity29 on the side of a virtual can the message is usually displayed when visitors attempt to type a swear word			1
the names ' straight ' and ' @entity37 ' are both accepted @entity38 , managing director of the company which produce the awards , said : ' it is bitterly disappointing that @entity0 has not listened to the collective voice of the global gay community who are horrified by the @entity48 government 's anti-gay and repressive policies			1
' brands like @entity0 should be making a stand against the demonisation of gay people by withdrawing sponsorship for the @entity20			2
refusing to do so is a slap in the face to the international gay community			0
' earlier today the company was embarrassed after it emerged visitors to one of its website have been banned from writing ' gay ' or ' gays ' on a virtual can			1
users of the page are instead given the message ' oops			0
let 's pretend you did n't just type that			1
please try another name ' which is usually displayed when a swear word is entered			0
the company has also been accused of downplaying its sponsorship of the @entity6 in the @entity74 , to avoid upsetting gay rights activists			2
while there has been little or no advertising from @entity0 in the @entity78 , @entity21 has been covered with the company 's distinctive white and red logo , which features on flags , lampposts and even security officers ' uniforms			2
images have also been circulating online of an @entity87 security guard tackling a gay rights protester while wearing a uniform which features the @entity0 logo			0
here the @entity0 logo is clearly visible in the centre of the two hexagons on this officer 's trousers @entity95 , a gay rights protester , was arrested during the olympic torch relay by an officer wearing a uniform with the same logo on his right leg the security guards have patrolled alongside the @entity87 torch as it has travelled across @entity21 the ' share a @entity0 with ... ' promotion has been running since the summer and features people 's names written on cans where the company logo would usually go			1
if you can not find a can with the name you want on it , @entity0 encourage you to visit their website and create your own virtual can			0
the ' @entity115 ' message is usually only displayed if the user tries to type a swear word , but also applies to the words ' gay ' and ' gays ' on the @entity122 page			0
the names ' straight ' and ' @entity37 ' are both deemed to be acceptable			0
gay rights protestors , including @entity126 @entity125 , have slated @entity0 for backing the games , saying that gay @entity21 face ' brutal violence , complete oppression of the basic human right to speech , assembly and expression ' adding that ' @entity0 cares only about their @entity135 profits			2
' in september , @entity137 marketing chairman @entity136 admitted that sponsors feared a backlash against sponsoring the games			0
speaking to @entity141 , he said : ' i have heard a lot from the sponsors , especially the @entity78 sponsors , of what they are afraid of might happen			0
i think this could ruin a lot for all of us			0
' the criticism of @entity0 and other brands , such as @entity151 's and @entity152 , for sponsoring the event comes after @entity21 passed a law banning gay ' propaganda ' last year , leading to calls for a boycott			1
while @entity0 has not advertised the fact it is sponsoring the @entity20 in @entity161 countries , @entity21 have been photographed holding branded flags which again feature the distinctive hexagon design here residents of @entity167 wave branded flags , standing between @entity0 signs and a truck @entity48 has said the law poses no threat to foreign visitors during the games , and has defended himself against allegation that he is prejudiced by saying he has gay friends and admires @entity176 today @entity135 's mayor @entity177 , who is a member of president @entity48 â€™s @entity179 party , said there were no gays in his town , and that homosexuality was ' not accepted here in the @entity185 '			1
the comments follow on from a bizarre interview in which president @entity48 claimed he was ' not prejudiced in any way ' , despite saying that the anti-gay legislation was necessary to ' clean up ' @entity21 and drive up the country 's birth rate , which he believes has been hampered by the gay population			2
speaking to the @entity195 show , mr @entity48 said that visitors to @entity21 had nothing to fear from the anti-gay law , adding that he had gay friends himself and was a huge admirer of @entity176 's ' professional achievements ' , despite his sexuality			1
