the @entity0 is well - known as one of the most romantic films of all time			0
so it ’s about time that a wannabe groom decided to pop the question using inspiration from the famous movie			2
@entity10 – with a little help from a proposal planner – hired a private lake in @entity14 , north @entity15 , and filled it with 1000 origami swans to propose to his girlfriend , @entity17			1
a little help from his friends : @entity22 asked his friends and family to help out with the proposal and they stood alongside the lake inspired : @entity28 's proposal was inspired by the famous scene in the notebook where @entity31 ( @entity32 ) rows @entity33 ( @entity34 ) out onto the lake outside of his house the gesture was a reference to the famous scene in the @entity41 movie where @entity31 , played by @entity32 , took his love @entity33 , played by @entity34 , on a boat ride to a beautiful lake that was filled with swans			1
the whole moment was captured on camera by @entity48 - the woman who helped @entity28 plan his proposal			2
@entity50 was also on hand to row into the lake and help release the origami swans into the water			1
although the effect was n't quite as spectacular as the blockbuster movie , from the look on @entity17 's face she certainly appreciated the gesture			2
@entity28 then asked his friends and family to hold up signs which contained the worlds , ' @entity17 , @entity61 ? you are the one			0
' during the video , @entity17 is also seen being serenaded by a singer - the woman sings the @entity10 's favourite songs as she walks alongside them on the banks of the lake			1
happy couple : @entity28 ( middle ) and @entity75 ( right ) pose with @entity76 's @entity48 ( left ) , a proposal planner lovely singing : @entity28 hired a singer to play @entity17 's favourite songs as they rowed around the lake @entity50 - who now runs romance company @entity76 but previously set up the @entity86 's first proposal planning company - then delivers the couple some pink cocktails			1
she told @entity89 that planning the proposal with @entity28 , who now lives in @entity15 with @entity17 , was challenging given that she only had a week 's notice			2
' i helped @entity28 plan his proposal to @entity17 after he got in touch with just one week ’s notice , ' she said			0
‘ he had no idea how he wanted to propose so i had a long phone conversation with him and discovered that she loved the movie " @entity99			1
’ the special moment : @entity28 had the ring with him in the boat the whole time waiting to propose to @entity17 surprise : at they rowed around the lake @entity17 began to notice the paper swans floating around in the water @entity50 continued : ' with just seven days to plan , we were really up against it time wise			1
' plus , the proposal involved securing a private boating lake in @entity15 which is not an easy task ! ‘ we got a singer to sing her favourite songs and made 1000 origami swans out of paper that we floated onto the lake as they rowed around			1
' @entity28 also wanted his family and friends included , so we had to keep them hidden in the bushes until the right moment ! ’ the special moment was filmed for the tv show the proposers , which aired on @entity127			0
and luckily all of @entity28 's planning was not in vain			0
during the proposal , he tells @entity17 : ' when we are together , everything is possible			0
' i did this because when i met you , one year ago more or less , my life changed			0
' he then presented her with a diamond ring and she accepted his proposal			0
the video was made for the tv series last year and @entity28 and @entity17 are now happily married .			0

@entity10 @entity146 wanted to ask girlfriend @entity147 to marry him
he tailored his proposal around her favourite film @entity99
he arranged for *1,000* origami swans to float on a lake like a scene in movie
