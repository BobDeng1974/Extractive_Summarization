surgeons have carried out the @entity2 ’s first transplant of a non-beating heart			1
donor hearts are usually from people who are brain - stem dead , but whose hearts are still beating			0
in this case , the organ came from a donor after their heart and lungs had stopped functioning			0
surgeons at @entity16 in @entity17 restored function to the heart before placing it on an @entity21 to maintain its quality before it was transplanted			1
it is the first time such a procedure has been performed in @entity25			0
surgeons at @entity16 in @entity17 restored function to the heart before placing it on an @entity21 to maintain its quality before it was transplanted to 60 - year - old @entity28 from @entity29 @entity30 , 60 , from @entity29 , who underwent surgery earlier this month , had a heart attack in 2008			1
he said : ‘ before the surgery , i really had no quality of life			2
now i ’m feeling stronger every day			1
’ the hospital said mr @entity28 was making ‘ remarkable progress ’ after spending only four days in its critical care unit before being allowed to go home			2
currently not everyone who needs a heart transplant can have one due to there not being enough suitable ones available			2
however , it is hoped that by using non-beating hearts , the number of people able to have heart transplants could increase by up to 25 per cent in the @entity2 alone , saving hundreds of lives			1
last year , surgeons in @entity52 performed the world ’s first transplant using a non-beating heart			1
consultant surgeon @entity56 , who led the @entity16 transplant team , said : ‘ the use of this group of donor hearts could increase heart transplantation by up to 25 per cent in the @entity2 alone			1
’ there have been 171 heart transplant in the past 12 months in the @entity2			1
but demand exceeds supply , and some patients have to wait up to three years for a suitable organ , with many dying on the waiting list			0
non-beating - heart donors provide kidneys , livers and other organs , but until now it has not been possible to use the heart because of concerns it would suffer damage			0
@entity28 , from @entity29 ( pictured with wife @entity77 ) , who became the first person in @entity25 to receive the surgery following a heart attack in 2008 , said he is ' feeling stronger every day ' following the operation mr large added : ‘ this is a very exciting development			1
by enabling the safe use of this kind of donor hearts , we could significantly increase the total number of heart transplants each year , saving hundreds of lives			1
’ the first successful transplant carried out using the @entity21 – also known as ‘ heart in a box ’ – took place in @entity95 in @entity96 last year , involving a heart that had stopped beating for 20 minutes			1
the system allows the donor heart to be connected to a sterile circuit of blood which restores the heartbeat and keeps it warm , limiting the adverse effects associated with previous methods which saw hearts kept on ice			0
using the preservative solution and the heart in a box , the organ is able to be reanimated , preserved and assessed until it is ready to go into a recipient			0
it is not clear how long after it stopped beating that the doctors at @entity16 restarted the heart			0
they used ultrasound to assess the function of the restarted heart for 50 minutes before approving it for transplantation			0
they then removed it from the donor , placed it in the heart - in - a - box machine which perfused the organ with blood and nutrients , and kept it beating for three hours until the operation went ahead			0
the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) , developed by @entity133 , allows donor hearts to continue functioning in a near - perfect state outside the body during transport and until it is placed into the body of the recipient ‘ this is a phenomenal achievement , ’ said @entity140 , cardiothoracic transplant registrar at the hospital			2
‘ people who previously would not get a heart transplant will now be able to have them			2
’ more than 250 patients in @entity2 are on the waiting list for heart transplants , and around 900,000 people in the @entity2 are living with heart failure , according to the @entity151			1
mr @entity140 added : ‘ currently patients can wait over three years for a heart transplant			2
but less than half of the people on the waiting list will be transplanted			0
‘ about 13 per cent die while they are waiting , and around 30 per cent are removed from the list , because they become too unwell to have the operation			0
