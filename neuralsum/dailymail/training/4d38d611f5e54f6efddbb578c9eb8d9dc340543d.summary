@entity0 has delivered a blistering message to pundits who have used his @entity4 jokes to criticize @entity6 president @entity5 : ' go f * * * yourselves ! ' the comedian played clips during thursday night 's ' @entity11 ' of cable news talking heads discussing the impact of @entity0 's mockery			1
' look , making fun of something , that 's nothing new for us , so do n't act like us making jokes about a certain program or president is evidence that that politician or issue has reached some kind of tipping point for action , ' @entity0 said			1
' @entity0 is known for skewering politicians on his show , however conservative commentators claim he is ' more sympathetic to ' the @entity38			2
so when the funnyman gave a scathing critique of the rollout of @entity4 on a recent show , saying ' @entity38 ca n’t spin this turd ' , some pundits jumped on it			2
many questioned what effect ' losing @entity0 ' would have on the national dialogue			2
' when your political program becomes a punchline , you ’ve got problems , ' @entity49 wrote for @entity54			0
some commentators also used @entity0 's comedy routine to call for @entity4 's administrative chief , @entity58 secretary @entity57 , to step down over the website 's botched delivery			1
' when @entity0 and @entity65 are making fun of the job you are doing , and the website , what that speaks to is the fact that young @entity6 are laughing at the @entity71 and the website , ' a @entity62 said on @entity54 , @entity61 reported			0
however , when that @entity62 suggested that @entity57 resign after being lampooned on television , @entity0 joked : ' if that causes things to end , why was the network you were on still on the air ? ' the anchor went on to question why former president @entity80 did n't resign after constantly being mocked on tv			0
under fire : @entity58 secretary @entity57 ( left ) and @entity6 president @entity5 ( right ) have been criticized for the botched @entity4 website rollout it 's a comedy show : @entity0 asked if laughing at federal officials meant it was time for those officials to step down , why did n't anyone mention that to former president @entity80 or former vice president @entity89 that 's when @entity0 trotted out the choir and unleashed his scathing attack			1
' the jokes that we do on this program seem to accomplish very little , ' @entity0 sang			0
' they do perhaps provide a little catharsis or perspective maybe a little			0
but most of the things we complain about never change			0
' do n't you use our jokes as evidence that the thing you hate must be stopped , because i 'm sure when we joke about s * * * you like , you 're more than happy to ignore it			1
' we add insult , not injury			0
@entity112 * * * yourselves ! '			1
