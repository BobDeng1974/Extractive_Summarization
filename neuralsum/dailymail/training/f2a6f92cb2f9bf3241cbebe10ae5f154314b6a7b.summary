by @entity1 reporter a team of ' @entity3 ' have solved what is considered to be one of the last great mysteries - or hoaxes - of the doomed luxury liner , over a century after it sank			0
a woman who claimed to be the presumed - dead two - year - old daughter of a wealthy family that died on @entity13 in 1912 has been exposed as a fraud following extensive dna tests			1
@entity16 first came forward in 1940 claiming to be @entity17 , a toddler traveling with her parents @entity18 and @entity20 and seven - month - old brother @entity21 on the ship			1
@entity23 was a @entity24 entrepreneur and the family traveled with an extensive entourage of servants			0
solved : @entity16 first came forward in 1940 claiming to be the presumed - dead daughter of @entity18 and @entity29 , @entity30 , who was two - years - old when she is believed to have died on @entity13			1
now over 70 years later , the claims have been debunked through dna tests when the ship struck the iceberg , @entity21 , who was not with his family at the time , was taken onto a lifeboat by a maid , @entity39 , with both going on to survive			1
both mother and father and @entity17 are believed to have died looking for @entity21 and skipping their opportunities at being rescued			1
@entity21 then died in 1929 of ptomaine poisoning			0
@entity46 mounted a long campaign to be accepted by the surviving members of the wealthy @entity36 in the face of strong opposition , @entity45 reported			1
the bitter dispute was expected to have ended in 1992 when @entity46 died			1
but it was revived on the centenary of the sinking in 2012 when @entity46 ’s granddaughter , @entity55 , from @entity56 , restated the claim on a series of forums dedicated to the @entity13			1
she set up a website highlighting her claim and said she planned to write a book about the story			0
she claimed she had found a suitcase belonging to her grandmother which was full of documents substantiating the family case			2
she also tried to contact the @entity17 family and arrange a visit , prompting the intervention of their lawyers to ask her to cease			0
@entity74 , right ahead : the @entity13 struck this iceberg on april 14 , 1912 and sank			1
@entity16 claimed to have survived the sinking and be a member of a wealthy family on board that died a restraining order was taken out to stop ms @entity55 scattering her grandmother ’s ashes over the @entity17 family plot in @entity84 , @entity85 , with extra security measures put in place after she paid a visit to the area			1
if her claim was established , @entity55 would have been eligible to inherit much of the @entity36 wealth			1
the debate led to the founding of the @entity93 by @entity94 , a forensic scientist at @entity95 in @entity24 and a @entity13 researcher			2
@entity94 and some other ' @entity3 ' - as they have come to be known - asked both sides to take part in a screening of their @entity100 , which passes through the maternal line			2
@entity103 , the great niece of @entity17 ’s mother , agreed to take part			0
woods declined , but her half sister , @entity107 , who shared the same mother and same link to @entity16 , agreed			2
the tests revealed no genetic link between @entity46 or @entity55 and the @entity36 , exposing the decades - long mystery as nothing but a great hoax			1
the results are proof of what the @entity36 have long suspected to be true			2
' the @entity17 's never accepted mrs @entity16 ’s claim , but the stress it caused was real , ' said @entity120 , grandson of @entity18 's brother @entity121			1
' it forced my ancestors to relive painful memories described to me as immeasurable sorrow and unending grief			0
' i would like to thank @entity107 and @entity103 for offering their dna to stop this harassment			0
this was a courageous , selfless act , and i will remain forever indebted for their act of kindness			0
' copy of the front page of the @entity138 dated april 16 , 1912 @entity139 , a sister of @entity120 ’s , said : ' these dna results have uncovered a colossal fraud that has haunted my family for years			0
it was all about the money …			0
@entity55 wants to write a book and no doubt there are others out there who want to profit from our story			0
' prof @entity94 said : ' it is good to have a resolution here , but we must n’t forget that this is all about one of the more tragic of tales to come from the @entity13			0
the only mystery that remains now is who was @entity16			2
' @entity46 first appeared on a radio show called ' we , the @entity161 ' , claiming to have been saved on @entity13 at the last minute by her ' father ' @entity23 , who she said put her in a lifeboat with a man called ' mr @entity167 '			1
she said she was raised in @entity169 believing mr @entity167 was her father			0
she said mr @entity167 told her truth after she requested her birth certificate and shortly before his death , at which point they had moved to the @entity175			0
@entity46 said mr @entity167 also disclosed his real identity : @entity177 , who had been @entity13 ’s designer and builder and who was thought to have died in the sinking			1
further investigation suggests @entity46 was actually raised in @entity182 as @entity167			2
however @entity55 , 61 , a retired chef , is standing by her claims			2
she declined to comment on the dna results , but said she had her own dna evidence and the support of other members of the @entity36			2
the results , she said , will be revealed in a book she is currently writing			0
the project echoes the exposure of a similar bogus claim , made by @entity193 , who claimed to be @entity194 , the youngest daughter of the @entity196 tsar , @entity197 , who was killed by the @entity198 in 1918			0
after her death , dna research proved there was no genetic link between the woman and the family .			1

woman called @entity16 first came forward in 1940 claiming to be @entity30 , a two - year - old who died on the @entity13 in 1912 along with her wealthy parents , @entity18 and @entity20
@entity46 claimed she was saved at the last minute and was raised by a man she believed was her father but then found out the truth
a bitter dispute with the @entity36 carried on for decades and , when @entity46 died in 1992 , it was expected to be finished with
however in 2012 @entity46 's granddaughter , @entity55 , restated the claims , *potentially* making her eligible for a large stake of the @entity36 fortune
now dna tests using a maternal bloodline have proven there is no genetic link between @entity46 and the @entity36 , exposing the 70 - year mystery as a hoax
