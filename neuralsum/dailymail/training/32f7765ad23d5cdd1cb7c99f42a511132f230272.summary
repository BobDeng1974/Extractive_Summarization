it 's a massive week in the @entity1 as the final round of group stage fixtures are played and the last 16 line - up confirmed			0
while some groups are settled , there 's plenty to play for in others and some big names staring at elimination			2
ahead of wednesday 's fixtures , we take you through the permutations and possibilities for each of the final four groups			0
@entity18 @entity19 are guaranteed top spot in this group , while the other three teams all have a chance of joining them in the knockout phase			1
@entity26 will go through if they beat @entity27 in @entity28 and @entity29 fail to beat @entity19 in @entity30			1
if @entity29 lose , @entity26 can also advance with a score draw because of their superior goal difference to @entity27			1
however , if both matches end in a draw , @entity27 are the ones who go through			2
@entity29 can advance if they beat @entity19 and @entity27 fail to beat @entity26			1
if both @entity29 and @entity26 win , the @entity37 advance by virtue of their superior head - to - head record over the @entity41 champions			1
@entity42 will be pivotal when @entity26 head to @entity27 in their decisive @entity1 game a tense final night is in store in @entity18 as @entity27 , @entity29 and @entity26 aim to follow @entity19 @entity46 @entity47 and @entity48 are both comfortably through and they meet at the @entity49 to decide who 'll top the group			1
a win or draw will see the @entity55 champions finish first			2
if @entity47 win , they will finish top			1
@entity57 will ensure @entity59 football after @entity60 if they win or draw against @entity61 in @entity62			2
a defeat , however , will see the @entity64 through in their place			0
@entity66 returns to former club @entity47 as top spot in @entity46 is determined @entity48 and @entity47 meet at the @entity49 to determine who 'll finish top in @entity46 @entity70 @entity72 's 5 - 0 win at @entity73 on matchday five ensured they will top the group			1
in order to join them , the @entity30 must beat @entity77 and hope @entity78 lose at @entity79			0
if @entity73 win and @entity78 draw , the @entity82 side advance because of their superior head - to - head record			0
@entity77 could pounce and gain the @entity59 spot if they beat @entity73			0
@entity85 's @entity73 need to beat @entity77 and hope @entity78 lose against @entity72 to progress @entity73 and @entity78 could qualify alongside @entity72 from @entity70 @entity87 @entity88 will definitely finish top and @entity89 have second place sewn up in this pool			2
so it 's between @entity93 and @entity94 for the @entity59 spot			0
the @entity96 side need a win or a draw but a defeat would leave @entity94 third			0
@entity93 take on @entity94 for the @entity59 place in @entity87 only the @entity59 spot is up for grabs in @entity87 with @entity88 and @entity89 already through			0
