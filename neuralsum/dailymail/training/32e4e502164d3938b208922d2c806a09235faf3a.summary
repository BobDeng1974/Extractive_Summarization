by @entity0 residents of the predominantly white and wealthy southern part of @entity3 have launched a campaign to split from the rest of @entity7 's state capital and form their own breakaway city			1
if the campaigners get their way , the new city of @entity10 would encompass 107,000 residents , around 25 percent of @entity3 ’s current population			2

redrawing the map : residents of the predominantly white and wealthy southern part of @entity3 have launched a campaign to split from the rest of @entity7 's state capital and form their own breakaway city of @entity10 @entity21 is one of two exclusive malls that would fall within the proposed boundaries of @entity10 and therefore deny @entity3 of valuable sales tax dollars supporters of the proposal say they have about half of the 18,000 signatures they need to put incorporating @entity10 on the next ballot			1
significantly the proposed new city would include two major retail centers , @entity21 and the @entity33 , that currently provide @entity3 with 40 percent of its sales tax revenue			1
the split campaign emerged out of the ashes of a failed campaign to create a new school district			0
when state legislature mothballed those proposals in june - claiming they could n’t approve an independent school district that was unaffiliated with a city - organizers shifted their energies to the creation of @entity10 , reports @entity47			0
after @entity49 , the city of @entity3 accepted over 200,000 displaced @entity51 residents , the majority of whom were black and settled in the northern , urban parts of the city the split campaign emerged out of the ashes of a failed campaign to create a new school district by the wealthy , predominantly white residents of southern @entity3 according to recent study on the demographic impact of @entity49 , the city of @entity3 accepted over 200,000 displaced @entity51 residents , the majority of whom were black and settled in the northern , urban parts of the city			1
leaders of the @entity10 secession effort deny that this is the reason behind their plans			2
they claim the new city will be ‘ wide open ’ and downplay warnings of fiscal disaster for the rest of the city			0
‘ typically , the only comments you hear are those that try to create fear , ’ one of the leaders of the movement , @entity74 said			0
‘ they never support it with any documentation to make those claims			0
’ but opponents note that city funds were used to develop the retail areas that would end up sucking in sales taxes from residents of the poorer part of the city			0
@entity74 , right , one of the leaders of the @entity10 movement claims there is no proof that the split will have an adverse effect on @entity3 , while councilwoman @entity97 says the proposed change will affect everyone ‘ if they pull away from @entity3 , it will affect everyone , ’ city councilwoman @entity97 told @entity100			0
‘ we ’ve spent millions of dollars on improvements out there and making traffic better , and now they want to be their own city ? ’ a study by the @entity110 found that the effects of the partition would be economically devastating for the remainder of @entity3 , immediately creating a $ 53 million budget shortfall			1
the study also raised concerns as to whether the remaining portions of @entity3 , @entity7 ’s state capital , would be able to support public services despite the loss of tax revenue			2
as the tables below shows projected figures for @entity10 would create a town with an average income $ 30,000 higher than present day @entity3 , while the unemployment rate would be halved			1
according to figures compiled by the @entity110 , the new town would have a majority white population , as opposed to @entity3 which has a black majority and the number of people receiving food stamps would also be more than halved			2
@entity3 population : @entity135 : 40 @entity136 : 3 @entity138 income : 58kunemployment rate : 9.2 per @entity141 food stamps : 17 per cent @entity10 population : @entity143 : 23 @entity144 : 4 @entity146 income : 88kunemployment rate : 4.8 @entity149 food stamps : 7 percent			0

residents in the predominantly white and wealthy southern part of @entity153 are campaigning to become their own separate city of @entity10
supporters of the proposal say they have half the 18,000 signatures needed to get their scheme on the next ballot
after @entity49 more than 200,000 @entity51 residents - mainly black - moved to the northern , urban parts of the city
@entity10 would take with it two malls that provide @entity3 with 40 percent of its sales tax revenue
that would create a $ 53 million budget shortfall for @entity3
leaders of the @entity10 secession claim they are creating an ' open city ' and deny it will have any *negative* impact
the new city would be *70* percent white , compared to @entity153 which is 55 percent black
average income would be $ 30,000 more , while it would also have lower unemployment and less people receiving state *benefits*
