000 is privately owned , and not many people know that			0

' ' i 've learned there is a lot of money in misery , ' @entity9 said , ' and i hope i can instigate some change in that area			2
' despite explicit promises that the money would not be spent on infrastructure and would go towards helping flood victims return to normal life , a large portion of the money was spent on building projects			2
' $ 80 million was allocated to building the @entity238 in @entity3 , and a hefty lump of $ 100 million was spent in the @entity75 range , but it was n’t for flood mitigating projects			1

i 've never doubted my ability to put good initiatives into place , ' @entity9 said , ' emotionally , it 's very draining			0
my way forward is helping , i just want to help , but i ca n't , so i 'm unable to take even a step forward			0
these are the things that really get to me			0
