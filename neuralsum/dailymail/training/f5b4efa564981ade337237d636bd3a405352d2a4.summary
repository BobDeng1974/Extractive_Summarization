by @entity0 published : 19:10 est , 21 august 2013 updated : 02:57 est , 22 august 2013 it was the kind of wish list that a couple of young teenagers might make before heading off on a summer camping trip			1
included in it was strawberry jam , @entity9 chocolate spread , baby oil , @entity12 moisturiser , croissants , @entity15 crisps , hair removal cream and a pack of cards			2
in a sign that the reality of the trouble they are in had n’t quite set in , ‘ @entity32 ’ @entity20 and @entity21 munched pizza as they wrote out items that they ’d like brought to them to make their lives a little easier			1
the @entity39 women claim they were kidnapped while on holiday in @entity55 and forced by armed @entity57 gangsters to fly to @entity58 as drugs mules			1
yesterday they appeared before a judge for the first time and were asked why they had posed with a @entity58 police officer in a photograph – and not asked him for help – if they had been kidnapped			2
if found guilty of drug trafficking , the women face up to 15 years in jail			1
@entity58 ’s penal authority says 1,648 foreigners are currently in its prisons on drug trafficking charges , 31 of them @entity39 citizens			1
hearing : the pair look on as a lawyer speaks at a court at the @entity76 of @entity77			2
they are suspected of smuggling £ 1.5million worth of cocaine out of @entity58 worried : the pair looked glum and drawn as they were led away in handcuffs through the back of the court to a holding cell @entity20 and @entity21 , both 20 , were arrested at @entity86 as they checked in for a flight to @entity89 on august 6 , with £ 1.5million of cocaine in their suitcases			1
they looked tired and daunted as they sat side - by - side , in handcuffs , next to their solicitor @entity97 at the superior court in @entity77 yesterday			0
a lawyer for the prosecution said they did not believe the women were forced to smuggle the drugs because , by their own declaration , ‘ they had many chances to ask for help ’			1
@entity21 , 20 , wipes a tear as she listens to @entity58 judge @entity110 at the @entity77 courtroom he also pointed to the photographs on @entity20 ’s camera which showed them doing tourist activities in @entity48 and @entity116 – in particular a picture in which they allegedly posed with a police officer			1
he said the prosecution felt they had not told the truth in police interviews , adding that @entity123 near their hotel in @entity48 did not show them with anyone else			0
the hotel manager also claimed they were alone			0
the judge asked the women why they had not asked for help at the airport , to which they responded – through their translator – that they were worried and scared and did not know who they could trust or who was watching them			0
the women spent the past two weeks in a cell beneath @entity140 police station , where they could see their families twice a day			0
the @entity142 was even able to take them @entity144 ’s meals , cake , clothing , chewing gum and a @entity149 phrase book			1
but yesterday , reality hit when they found themselves in a ‘ dirty ’ cramped cell beneath the court at @entity77			0
after their appearance in court they were remanded in custody to the same cell			0
they will stay there until they are moved to a women ’s prison – most likely the notorious @entity166 jail – where they will stay for the next few months , or even years , while they wait for their case to be heard			2
@entity21 ’s lawyer , @entity170 , told the @entity142 : ‘ they are in a windowless cage on their own			1
they have no bedding and they have not been given any food			0
i have asked for them to be given mattresses or i will go and buy some			2
‘ their mood has changed			0
they are both very shaken and upset			0
