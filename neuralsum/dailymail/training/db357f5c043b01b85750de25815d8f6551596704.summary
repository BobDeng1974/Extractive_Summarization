by @entity0 stylish in a pair of on - trend print trousers and a simple white t - shirt , @entity3 's @entity2 @entity1 was every inch the chic holidaymaker as she arrived in @entity9 for a break with her husband @entity11 and two daughters			1
smiling broadly , the royal couple exchanged quips and smiles as they posed for pictures with their children , @entity18 , @entity19 , eight , and @entity20 , seven , on the steps of the @entity22 in @entity23			2
the two little princesses , dressed in matching bright pink and mint green frocks , were initially bashful but soon joined their parents as they met well - wishers who had waited outside the palace to see them			0
instead of lines of jager bombs and drunken fumbles on balconies , the @entity3 royals spend most of the time on their yacht , @entity52 , and the rest enjoying private dinners or wandering through the winding streets of the pretty @entity9 capital			0
although , unlike the @entity2 's summer residence @entity60 , the @entity59 is publicly owned , the royals ' @entity9 holiday is considered family time and rarely do visiting heads of state get to see inside			0
one group of visitors who did get to see inside , however , were the @entity67 and the @entity68 , who joined the @entity3 royals for a holiday in @entity9 in 1988			2
looks familiar : @entity70 and @entity68 posed on the same steps during their 1988 visit - as did @entity73 ( right ) happy memories : the @entity67 , prince @entity75 and princess @entity68 on the steps of the @entity77 family holiday : prince @entity70 ( right ) teaches prince @entity75 to swim watched by @entity79 of @entity80 close family : @entity11 affectionately strokes @entity18 's cheek as their @entity9 family holiday begins family supper : later , the @entity3 royal family was pictured leaving the @entity86 for a private dinner like @entity2 @entity1 and @entity11 , they joined former @entity89 and his wife @entity90 for photographs on the steps of the palace , along with their children - a three - year - old prince @entity75 and a five - year - old @entity96			1
the @entity98 royals also spent time on @entity52 , with prince @entity70 photographed teaching @entity75 how to swim under the watchful gaze of fellow guest , @entity79 of @entity80			0
while @entity2 @entity1 and @entity11 wo n't be getting a visit from the @entity98 royals this summer , they will be spending time with their daughters and splashing around in the sea			1
although a visit to @entity46 is unlikely , the royal pair are expected to travel to other parts of the island with @entity108 in the north and the wine - growing town of @entity112 among likely destinations			0
royal duties : after posing for photographs , the couple shook hands with waiting well - wishers and journalists happy family : the two young princesses were on their best behaviour as they met well - wishers family resemblance : the two princesses and their mother @entity2 @entity1 closely resemble one another home from home : the @entity3 royals will be spending their holiday in their @entity23 royal residence			1
