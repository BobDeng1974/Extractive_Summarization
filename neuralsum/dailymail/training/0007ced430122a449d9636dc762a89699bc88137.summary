many long - haul flight times will be dramatically reduced as planes are allowed to take a short cut over the @entity3			1
changes in aviation rules , which apply to twin - engine jets such as a @entity7 , will mean passengers can reach exotic destinations without making a stop			1
during the flights passengers will be treated to stunning views of the @entity14			1
shorter flights : a @entity16 @entity7 which will be able to take a ' short cut ' over the @entity3 the decision to allow the flights , dubbed @entity21 ’s short cut , is likely to cut flight prices , open up new destinations and reduce emissions			1
until now , regulators have insisted the jets must always be within three hours of a suitable place to land			1
this is because the failure of one engine on such a plane is potentially far more serious than for one with three or four			2
however , due to safety improvements the jets can now be five - and - a - half hours from a suitable landing spot			1
travellers boarding flights from @entity37 will be able to fly non-stop to @entity38 in 18 hours			2
previously , they faced a 24 - hour journey via @entity40 or @entity41			1
@entity38 ( 10,000 miles ) - current time via @entity43 or @entity41 : 24 hours			1
new time : 18 hours non-stop using ' polar express ' short cut			2
@entity45 ( 9,600 miles ) via @entity43 : 23 hours			2
new time : 17 hours			2
@entity46 ( 7,300 miles ) via @entity43 : 18 hours			2
new time : 13 hours			0
@entity47 ( 4,500 miles ) via @entity48 : 16 hours			0
new time : 8 hours 's short cut ' - over the @entity3 to destinations such as @entity51 , @entity52 or @entity54 @entity53 the changes mean that other routes which have not been flown before can be used			1
this will reduce the flight time to @entity47 in @entity52 from 16 hours to eight because pilots will no longer have to fly via @entity48			1
as a result , @entity7 and 787 ‘ dreamliner ’ jets will be able to fly almost anywhere in the world			0
sir @entity64 , president of @entity65 , said of the ruling by the @entity67 : ‘ this development really does open up a whole new world			1
‘ apart from the stunning destinations on arrival , the @entity14 scenery will be just amazing			0
' our new fleet of 787s could well be flying to @entity46 or even @entity38 one day			0
’ as well as the @entity3 , many trans - @entity76 journeys have hitherto been out - of - bounds for twin - engine planes			1
jets with more than two engines have been allowed to fly over the @entity3 for some years			0
the first airline to take advantage of the ‘ extended operations ’ option for twin engines is @entity87 which earlier this month flew from @entity40 to @entity88			0
chief pilot captain @entity89 said : ‘ what this means is that the aeroplane is able to fly a straighter route between pairs of cities , and that ’s good for the environment			0
frozen : an aerial view of the @entity14 which passenger carriers will now be able to fly over to exotic destinations ‘ less fuel is burned and less carbon dioxide is emitted into the atmosphere			0
it ’s also good for customers because flights are potentially shorter			0
’ but not everyone in aviation is happy with the changes			0
while it is generally accepted that dual engine failure is extremely unlikely , some safety experts expressed concern about cabin conditions during a diversion			0
one safety manager , who wished to remain anonymous , said : ‘ it ’s all very well being able to make a safe landing , but passengers are likely to be distraught and extremely cold after a five - hour diversion to an airstrip in the @entity14			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity123 said : ‘ our members are confident that the safety case for equipment redundancy , pilot training and passenger welfare will be fully satisfied			0
’ planes flew over the @entity3 during the @entity131 in the 1950s to avoid @entity134 airspace .			0

long - haul flight times reduced by up to 50 *%*
