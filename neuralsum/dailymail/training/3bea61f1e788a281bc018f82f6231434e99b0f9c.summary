cuts : the @entity4 plans to slash the size of his force and shift the military 's focus to @entity12 under a new budget proposal ' we 're now out of @entity28 , we 're reducing our commitment in @entity30 , so we can now bring the size of the @entity3 down			1
and i feel comfortable with how we 're going to do that , ' gen @entity15 said in an interview from his @entity4 office			2
' it 's more about the timeline we bring it down on , and i 'm satisfied with that timeline			0
' the @entity4 will preview president @entity42 's budget proposal for the @entity4 on thursday			1
it is expected to cut $ 260billion in projected defence spending over the next five years and favour services like the @entity45 and the @entity46 over the @entity3 and @entity47			1
at ease : gen @entity15 says he 's ' comfortable ' with how the @entity4 plans to reduce the size of the army as part of $ 260billion in cuts a @entity53 official confirmed media reports that the @entity4 plans to slash eight @entity3 brigades and reduce the overall force to as few as 490,000 over the next decade from around 565,000			1
but president @entity42 and defense secretary @entity58 have said they will not hollow - out the force with the kind of cuts the military endured in the wake of the @entity64			0
prominent in the plan is a renewed focus on @entity12 , where @entity69 's rapid military modernization has raised worry in @entity71 and rattled @entity53 allies			0
that , along with continued security threats in the @entity74 - especially @entity75 - is why @entity58 wants to invest more in certain air and naval assets			0
he also is putting a focus on cybersecurity and commando forces like those who killed @entity84 last may and who swooped into @entity86 on tuesday to rescue two hostages , including an @entity53			1
the @entity4 has embraced a proposal by special operations chief adm @entity89 to send more manpower and equipment to worldwide ' @entity92 ' to strike back wherever threats arise , according to a senior defence official who spoke to the @entity95 , and other current and former @entity53 officials briefed on the program			1

gen @entity15 saw no downsizing of the @entity3 presence in @entity12 and said it will further supplement its forces with troops who rotate in and out of the region			1
he said : ' that 's what we got to decide : how much rotational presence will we be able to do '			0
should the @entity3 be reduced in size to help the economy ? gen @entity15 noted that the @entity3 could play an important diplomatic role engaging with militaries in @entity12 , given that 22 out of the 28 chiefs of defence in the @entity116 are army officers			1
seven out of the world 's 10 largest land armies in the world are in the @entity116 , he added			0
that common army background ' will help us to build relationships , ' he said			0

' while secretary @entity58 has conceded that our nation is now accepting more risk as a result of the budgetary vise squeezing the @entity4 , it remains unclear exactly what risks our nation is assuming , ' rep @entity170 , @entity171 , a @entity172 member , said this week			2
@entity15 , who in the past commanded @entity53 forces in @entity28 , has put together @entity175 , a pamphlet explaining his vision for the future of the @entity3 that he intends to start distributing next week			1

' the president , the secretary [ of defence ] have been very clear , that they need a strong , capable @entity3			1
we will continue to have a strong , capable @entity3 , ' he said			2
