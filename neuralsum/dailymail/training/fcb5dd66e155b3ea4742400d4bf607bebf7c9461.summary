a $ 5million order for custom crystal glasses and bar accessories was placed for @entity4 embassies on the day before the government shutdown			1
the @entity6 finalized the order for custom stemware on september 30 , just hours before nearly one million federal workers were put on unpaid leave as a result of the on - going budget dispute in @entity13			0
the contract was awarded to @entity15 , a @entity17 stemware company that makes hand blown crystal that retails for up to $ 85 - per - wine glass			1
serving up contracts : a @entity17 - based company called @entity15 was awarded a $ 5million @entity6 contract to produce stemware for @entity4 embassies and consulates the order calls for more than 12,000 pieces of 20 different styles			1
' we ’re thrilled with the contract and will take great pride in having @entity17 product in the hands of people around the world , ' @entity15 ceo @entity29 told the @entity36			2
another stipulation of the order is that all of the crystal be made in the @entity4 with the majority of the collection being made in the company 's factory in @entity45 , @entity17			1
' @entity15 is a natural fit for this given its production in @entity17 and @entity49 , ' mr @entity29 said in a statement			2
table diplomacy : @entity4 embassies host major political dinners and functions , like this one attended by then - secretary of state @entity55 in @entity56 in 2007 the timing of the contract is problematic for the department as the @entity60 , which is the government body that handles the pricing out and awarding of contracts to small businesses , notes that the contract was finalized on september 25 and posted on the 30th			1
pricey : this particular style of white wine glass sells for $ 85 - per - glass while this year 's budget battle is unusual given the shutdown , it is not uncommon for ornamental orders to be placed during the last week of september because if it is not ordered before the cut - off , they will have to wait another fiscal year to do so , when more pressing items like paychecks and security costs take precedent			1
the @entity6 was far from the only offender during this year 's so - called ' use it or lose it ' week , as the @entity84 reports that the @entity85 spent more than a half a million dollars on artwork			0
the @entity88 spent $ 178,000 repairing cubicle furniture , and the @entity90 blew six figures on toner cartridges			0
this is the first time that @entity15 is the recipient of such an order , but that should also come as little surprise considering it had a well - connected friend vying for them			0
senator @entity100 , who represents @entity17 , is the head of the @entity103 subcommittee that oversees @entity6 funding , meaning that he was in a unique position to push for his local company			0
his pleas did n't fall on unfamiliar ears either , as secretary of state @entity109 is from nearby @entity110			0
' it is wonderful to have such an exquisite example of @entity17 craftsmanship on display and in use in our embassies around the world , ' senator @entity100 said in a statement			0
' @entity121 [ his wife ] and i have visited many of those embassies , and knowing that @entity15 ’s products will be there is something that all @entity17 should be proud of			2
