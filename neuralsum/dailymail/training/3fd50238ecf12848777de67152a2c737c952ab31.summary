by @entity0 the tobacco hornworm eats tobacco leaves containing doses of nicotine deadly to humans , smokes the toxin to ward off spiders a caterpillar that eats tobacco leaves containing lethal doses of nicotine ' smokes ' the toxin to ward off predators			1
until now scientists were unsure of how the tobacco hornworm processed the addictive substance to use as a weapon against hungry spiders			1
they have discovered that some of the toxin enters the insect ’s blood while the remainder is excreted through tiny respiratory holes on its skin and in turn works as an effective deterrent			1
@entity28 , a molecular ecologist at the @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , told @entity32 that the tobacco hornworm can handle nicotine better than any other animal on the planet and ingests six times the lethal dosage of nicotine for humans every day			1
to find out why the creature can process nicotine so expertly , professor @entity28 and his team modified some coyote tobacco plants by stopping their nicotine production and planted them in a test filed in @entity47			0
they then monitored the overnight survival rates of caterpillars eating the modified plants , compared to those munching the regular tobacco plants			0
they discovered that the creatures eating the nicotine - free diet were more likely to die from being attacked by wolf spiders , which live in the area			2
the scientists tested the spiders ’ feeding habits in the lab and found that they did not like eating nicotine , suggesting that the caterpillar uses the toxin to survive			2
the tobacco hornworm caterpillar can handle nicotine better than any other animal on the planet and ingests six times the lethal dosage of nicotine for humans every day the large green caterpillar has a distinctive horn on its bottom segment , which gives it its name			1
it can grow up to 80 mm long and can quickly strip leaves from tomato and tobacco plants			0
known as a garden pest , the tobacco hornworm is commonly found in the @entity84 as far north as @entity85 and as far south as @entity86			2
predators of the caterpillar include : polistes wasps , big - eyed bugs and lace wings as well as wolf spiders			2
the caterpillar is used by scientists to look at neurobiology , flight mechanics and larval nicotine resistance in the lab the caterpillars are blue because the artificial wheat germ diet they are fed does not contain the yellow pigments that normally combine with proteins to turn their bodies green			0
a previous study uncovered that a gene , @entity107 , expressed in the caterpillar ’s midgut , is not as active in the caterpillars that were fed plants with less nicotine			0
after creating plants able to silence the @entity107 gene , they found the caterpillars that ate them became more attractive to spiders			0
they worked out that the gene takes around 0.65 per cent of the nicotine from the midgut and transports it into the animal ’s blood , but most of it is excreted			1
the researchers believe the caterpillars puffs out the nicotine through tiny respiratory holes called spiracles that they breathe through and the nicotine tells the spider the caterpillar is deadly			1
the scientists tested wold spiders ' feeding habits in the lab and found that they do not like eating nicotine , suggesting that caterpillar uses the toxin to survive attacks from the arachnids ( pictured ) to test their theory , they stuck tiny ‘ nicotine trapping devices ’ onto the spiracles and took them off after a spider caught the modified caterpillar			0
the devices proved that the caterpillar had been emitting puffs of nicotine when it was under attack			0
‘ normally , it would work as a type of toxic halitosis , or bad breath , ’ professor @entity28 said			0
however , while bad breath works as a deterrent against wolf spiders , it does not protect the caterpillars from all predators – especially not from @entity163 ( known commonly as big - eyed bugs ) , another major predator in the habitat			0
the researchers think this could be because while the @entity171 pallens only suck the insect ’s blood , spiders eat the creature ’s gut , which is packed full of nicotine			1
the researchers found that the caterpillar puffs out the nicotine through tiny respiratory holes that they breathe through , called spiracles and the nicotine tells the spider the caterpillar is deadly			1

each day the tobacco hornworm caterpillar ingests six times the lethal dosage of nicotine for humans
scientists the @entity29 , @entity31 , found that a gene transports a small *amount* of nicotine into the animal ’s blood
the creature processes the remaining nicotine to release it through respiratory holes in its skin , to ward off wolf spiders
