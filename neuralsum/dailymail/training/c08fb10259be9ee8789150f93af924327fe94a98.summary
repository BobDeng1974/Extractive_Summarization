@entity1 films such as minority report show people controlling computer programmes with expansive hand gestures			2
and now there 's a gadget called flow that will allow users to do just that , which could one day replace the computer mouse			1
flow is designed to be more sensitive than a mouse and will allow people to edit documents , draw and control apps by touching it or swiping in mid air above the gadget			1
@entity12 , a gadget that responds to gestures and touch could be used to edit documents , draw and control apps , replacing the computer mouse it can be programmed with shortcuts for more than 30 applications , enabling users to control @entity28 with the flick of their wrist or use it to manipulate images in @entity32			1
the gadget , designed by engineers in @entity35 , @entity36 , works alongside a desktop or laptop via a @entity40 connection , with apps such as @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity28 and @entity44			1
the engineers and computer scientists are raising money on crowd funding site @entity49 to put @entity12 into production			1
@entity12 ( pictured ) works alongside a desktop or laptop via a @entity40 connection , with apps such as @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity28 and @entity44			2
for example , a user could programme the device to skip tracks in a @entity28 playlist by swiping in mid-air over the device flow will allow users to manipulate images and documents using hand gestures , such as in sci - fi films like @entity2 ( a screenshot is pictured ) - without the light - up gloves to begin with , the device will support @entity69 , with @entity71 devices , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity75 support in the pipeline			1
it could be used alongside work equipment or in the home ( pictured ) which may mean that smart appliances could one day be controlled using the simple device description : a programmable wireless controller that is small enough to fit in a pocket and could one day replace the computer mouse			1
materials : a metal ring and polycarbonate touch surface			0
connectivity : @entity91 / 4.1			0
compatibility : macs , with more operating systems in the pipeline - starting with 30 popular apps			2
size : almost three inches ( 7cm ) in diameter and half an inch ( 1.5cm ) high			0
sensors : 360 ° angular positioning , capacitive touch , light and infrared hand gesture recognition			0
they say : ‘ we work on graphic design , video editing or cad on a daily basis			0
keyboard and mouse are great but they are far from giving you the same sensitivity and abilities as your hand			0
‘ the same applies for music , browsing or presentations			0
we need a tool that gives us flexible shortcuts and perfect control , a tool that makes the things we love fast , precise , intuitive and fun			1
‘ that 's why we created @entity12 , a freely programmable wireless controller			1
’ the team combined three technologies into their small circular device so it can recognise hand gestures , sensitive touch and precise haptics ( such as being tapped ) via sensors			2
they say that controls for more than 30 popular applications will be available at launch with more becoming available week by week			2
‘ let us know which shortcuts or controls are important to you and we 'll get right to work , ’ they wrote			0
the engineers creayed @entity12 beacuse they said that the computer mouse is ' far from giving you the same sensitivity and abilities as your hand , ' whereas their gadget has more sensing capabilities he team combined three technologies into their small circular device ( pictured in a work situation ) so it can recognise hand gestures , sensitive touch and precise haptics via sensors to begin with , the device will support @entity69 , with @entity71 devices , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity75 support in the pipeline			1
the gadget is open source so users with some coding know - how will be able to build new shortcuts and applications			1
flow is available to pre-order via @entity49 for $ 99 plus shipping , with an estimated delivery date of june 2015			1
@entity174 has revealed a next - generation kind of eye tracking mouse , called @entity177 +			0
when positioned below a computer monitor , the portable box allows disabled people to write documents or browse the internet by blinking and moving their eyes			0
the device works by wirelessly calibrating with the user 's eye as long as they sit or lie between 23 inches ( 60cm ) and 27 inches ( 70cm ) away from the monitor			0
@entity174 has revealed a next - generation kind of eye tracking mouse , called @entity177 + which allows disabled users such as @entity192 ( pictured ) to browse the internet by blinking and moving his eyes @entity195 + only needs to be set up when a person uses it for the first time and remembers individuals ’ eye characteristics			2
the gadget was developed by @entity174 engineers in their spare time , with help from quadriplegic grad student @entity192			2
by using the system for 17 months , the team were able to refine the tracking system - a number of which will be built for charities			0
the technology is open source so that anyone can commercialise it .			0

flow is a small programmable wireless controller created by engineers and computer scientists in @entity35 , @entity36
it is designed to be more sensitive and flexible than a computer mouse
gadget can be programmed with shortcuts for more than 30 applications
users could control apps with the flick of a wrist , or by tapping the device
