@entity0 was at the centre of controversy last night after @entity4 ’s second most powerful politician said the party must stop making racist remarks about immigrants			1
@entity8 , @entity4 ’s first elected mp said : ‘ dislike of foreigners is not merely offensive , but absurd			1
’ the party must be ‘ inclusive ’ and have no truck with candidates who insult people ’s ‘ heritage or background ’ , he says in an article in today ’s @entity17			1
@entity21 mp mr @entity8 is the first senior @entity4 politician to admit , in effect , that some of the party ’s members are racist			1
his comments will be seen by some as criticism of mr @entity0 , who defended @entity4 parliamentary candidate @entity35 after he was sacked earlier this month for referring to a ‘ @entity37 bird ’ and ‘ pooftahs ’ in abusive and obscene phone calls			1
mr @entity0 said he felt sorry for ‘ rough diamond ’ mr @entity35			1
the @entity4 leader also blamed immigration for causing traffic jams on the @entity44			1
friends of the mp last night stressed he had no criticism of mr @entity0 and that he ‘ wholeheartedly supports ’ the party leader			1
but the difference in tone between rabble - rouser mr @entity0 and intellectual mr @entity8 , who spent his childhood in @entity51 , will not go unnoticed			1
mr @entity8 says : ‘ no @entity4 candidate should ever make the mistake of blaming outsiders for the failings of political insiders in @entity57			1
friends of the mp last night stressed he had no criticism of mr @entity0 and that he ‘ wholeheartedly supports ’ the party leader ‘ far from being a party that tolerates pejorative comments about people ’s heritage and background , @entity4 has to show that we have serious internationalist agenda			1
’ it must offer a ‘ cheery , welcoming yes to doctors from @entity69 or scientists from @entity71 ’ while rejecting foreign criminals and benefit scroungers			1
but mr @entity8 warns : ‘ angry nativism must have no part in it			1
’ @entity4 has made great strides , but must change its attitude to break through in the general election , he says , adding : ‘ we have to show the whole country that we have what it takes to win big			1
that means an optimistic and inclusive agenda			1
’ it 's not only offensive to dislike foreigners ... it 's absurd says @entity8 mr @entity8 , arriving at the @entity89 in october , defected from the @entity90 to @entity4 for all the problems in the modern world , most people living in most parts of the planet are better off in 2014 than they were in 2013			1
people today generally live longer , healthier , more prosperous lives than their parents or grandparents			1
and 2015 is likely to be even better			1
why is life getting better for most people ? because we have become ever more interdependent			1
instead of each family , village or country trying to do everything for itself , we have learnt how to do things for each other			1
as a consequence , there is more for everyone			2
far from being @entity114 , life in pre-industrial @entity113 was grim			2
infant mortality was staggeringly high , hunger a constant feature of childhood			2
life for the average farm labourer in my part of @entity123 meant more than 80 hours of unrelenting slog each week			2
for as long as folk in @entity123 depended only on other @entity123 folk for what they had , they did not have very much of it ; books , cloth and candles were luxuries			2
what was true for @entity123 was true for most communities throughout the world			2
but then @entity114 discovered a remarkable trick ; how to depend on others – those outside our counties , then our country and even continent – to provide us voluntarily with the things we needed			2
there has never been anything splendid about isolation			2
it was our interdependence that put the @entity150 into @entity113 – and it is what sustains our living standards today			2
in such a world , a dislike of foreigners is not merely offensive , but absurd			1
instead of having to produce most of what we eat within a few miles of where we live , our supermarket shelves are crammed with produce from every country under the sun. over-consumption is now a bigger public health problem than under - consumption			2
our homes are filled with washing machines , iphones and other modern gizmos from all around the world			2
each of those gadgets is itself a product of human interdependence ; the microchips made in @entity177 or @entity178 , moulded plastic via @entity180 oil , software written by coders in @entity183 or @entity184			2
human interdependence has not only raised living standards here in our country			2
it is the motor of human progress that has lifted human kind from the swamps to the stars			2
globalisation is drawing almost all of humanity into a vast , sprawling network of innovation and exchange			0
the fundamental challenge for any government – including a @entity4 - backed administration – is how we might manage and enhance our interdependence in the decades ahead			1
thus far , the established parties in @entity57 have done a terrible job of preparing us for the future			0
vital , if @entity113 is to thrive , is the ability of @entity207 to trade freely and openly with the world			0
not only are we trapped inside the only declining trade bloc in the world , being in the @entity211 prevents us from having the open trade relationships with the parts of the world that are growing			0
mr @entity8 says ahead of may 's general election , @entity4 ' have to show the whole country that we have what it takes to win big ' the @entity211 , beholden to various lobby interests , refuses to sign a free trade deal with @entity221			1
while @entity222 has concluded a trade agreement with @entity224 , the @entity211 has failed to			0
rather than enhancing commercial interdependence , @entity225 recently fined the @entity207 because we failed to charge high enough protectionist trade tariffs on certain @entity224 imports			0
far from being a party that tolerates pejorative comments about people ’s heritage and background , @entity4 in 2015 has to show that we have a serious internationalist agenda			1
we stand to realign our trade relations precisely because we wish to join in with the rest of the world			0
increased interdependence is going to mean ever greater labour mobility – not just between countries but between continents			0
voters , in my view , will only accept the labour mobility required if we first control our borders			0
preparing for the future means putting in place an immigration system capable of saying a cheery , welcoming ‘ yes ’ to doctors from @entity69 or scientists from south @entity71 , and a polite ‘ no , thank you ’ to someone with a criminal record , or an inclination towards welfare dependence			0
angry nativism must have no part in it			0
technology already exists that allows hundreds of thousands to log in and out of the @entity262 each week			0
so why has no government managed to devise a system capable of logging folk in and out when they cross our borders ? no @entity4 candidate should ever make the mistake of blaming outsiders for the failings of political insiders in @entity57			1
in previous centuries , wealth was created by growing things			0
then , during the industrial revolution , by making things			0
increasingly , wealth is a matter of intellectual property – or of thinking things			0
in this world , many @entity207 school leavers remain woefully ill - equipped for the skills that they are going to need			0
education reform – first under @entity286 , then @entity287 – has been watered down by vested interests			0
if @entity113 is to flourish in the future , we need a government prepared to take on the vested interests , not only in education , but throughout the wider economy			0
instead we seem to have governments beholden to different corporate interests			0
banks have been endlessly bailed out			0
far from competing to attract funds from depositors with generous interest payments , many banks depend on cheap credit handouts from government			0
the energy market is fixed against the householder			0
rather than competing to supply customers with energy at a price they might be willing to pay , energy is generated to comply with quotas			0
it ’s not just the economy that is rigged in the interests of a few			0
our political system has become a cosy cartel run in the interests of career politicians looking to get into @entity320			0
@entity113 desperately needs political reform to inject a large dose of choice and competition back into politics			0
only then can we be certain that the full spectrum of policy options will be considered by policy makers to meet the challenges that lie ahead			0
@entity4 has had a remarkable year			1
no longer a mere protest party , we won the @entity332 elections and showed that we have what it takes to win seats in @entity320			1
ahead of may ’s general election , we now have to show the whole country that we have what it takes to win big			0
that means an optimistic , internationalist and inclusive agenda for the whole country .			1

@entity8 has said it is offensive and absurd to dislike foreigners
says @entity4 must be ' inclusive ' and not insult ' heritage or background '
comments come after series of race rows and a drop in party 's popularity
mp is the first senior @entity4 politician to admit , in effect , some members are racist
