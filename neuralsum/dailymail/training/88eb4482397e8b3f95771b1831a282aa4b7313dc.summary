' we ’re at the beginning of the process , but i want to do everything i can to help			0
' but mr @entity13 has not been met without opposition			1
@entity127 , the @entity48 coach , said he does not think @entity13 died from the helmet - to - helmet tackle			1
' it ’s a terrible thing when something this tragic transpires , ( but ) i keep hearing about late hits and spears and helmet - to - helmet collision and it just was n’t the case			1
' i ’ve reviewed that film many times , and it was an ordinary play			0
nobody did anything with malicious intent			0
' nobody did anything that was any different from what happened on football fields across @entity146 that night			0
' just a young boy : mr @entity13 was only 16 when his life was cut tragically short doing what he loved : mr @entity13 ( far left ) died after a vicious helmet - to - helmet tackle during a game the coach says he ' absolutely ' believes that there must ’ve been a pre-existing condition , maybe even a prior head trauma , that triggered @entity13 's loss of consciousness and ultimately his death			1

' he put 110 percent into everything he did , ' it said			0
' his motto was , ' giving up is simply not an option			0
' for some parents , the dangers were obvious even before @entity13 's death			1
as their sadness began to mix with anger , they complained that poor officiating , with no penalty calls on late hits , made it only a matter of time before ball carriers like @entity13 got hurt			1
the grief surrounding @entity13 's death has spread through the close - knit villages of @entity103 and @entity42 , tucked amid grape farms about an hour 's drive south of @entity201 , where the once - rival high schools were forced to combine their teams three seasons ago because of budget cuts			1

as iridescent ribbons sparkle from light poles in @entity103 , the players say they are moving on without football after making a decision that 's drawn both support and criticism — from those who believe @entity13 would have wanted the season to go on			1
' honestly , none of us can really say what @entity13 would have wanted , ' @entity279 said			2
' the only person who could have said that was @entity13			2
