@entity0 @entity2 diesel on sale : early 2015 @entity3 : £ 41,195 good @entity5 tests the features on the new seven - seater @entity0 in @entity7 bad			0

the **fantastic** **flexibility** of features *makes* this ***car*** ***great*** for **families**
the ***car*** is *highly* *rated* with more **emergency** ***braking*** and **stability** *****control*****
only the ***2.2*** litre @entity2 diesel ***version*** will be on sale in the @entity21
just in time for the @entity25 break , i took the *handsome* new seven - seater @entity0 to @entity7 ****—**** no , not the @entity27 *frozen* food *chain* , but a **proper** epic a*cross* ice and snow - *covered* *landscapes* on that @entity32 *island* *south* of the @entity33 .
we may have been *promised* a disco *inferno* near the still - *smouldering* *volcanoes* , but it was more like @entity39 on the road . i *'ve* never seen so many *fur* - clad *parkas* since a screening of the @entity44 film @entity45 .
this was no road test for *sissies* . i do *n't* *recall* *meeting* any *tarmac* outside @entity51 . most of the **cross*country* *driving* was on thick ice , thin ice , or snow . there was a *constant* *threat* of *blizzard* when , i *'m* told , *visibility* *drops* to *nil* . *thankfully* the **winter** tyres and *onboard* *safety* features were up to it .
on looks alone it ******'s****** a *winner* . it may be a *replacement* for the @entity67 , but it ******'s****** bigger , *smarter* , more *luxurious* and *flexible* , even though the *engine* and much of the *underpinnings* *remain* the same .
***great*** for **families** , thanks to **fantastic** **flexibility** . there are five seats for *everyday* use . but two *extra* ones *pop* up from the rear to *create* a *magnificent* seven .
the willing ***2.2*** litre @entity2 diesel is *linked* to a *smooth* 9 - **speed** @entity83 *automatic* *gearbox* and *accelerates* *briskly* from rest to *62mph* in *8.4* seconds so it ******'s****** *pretty* *nimble* around town and when *cruising* , as well as off road . **top** **speed** is *117mph* . *co2* *emissions* are a fair *161g/km* , *helped* by a ' s**top** - start ' *system* .
there ******'s****** the **option** of *manual* *override* via *paddles* on the *steering* **wheel** . and *boy* did i use them as i *traversed* *slippery* *glaciers* and *stormed* up steep , *snowclad* *hills* . for **winter** in @entity21 , it *'ll* do the *job* .
the hill - ***descent*** *****control***** was a *godsend* . it *takes* *****control***** of the *low* *gearing* and ***braking*** to give you a *reassuringly* *confident* ***descent*** .
it ******'s****** been *built* with about *2ft* ( *600mm* ) of *wading* *depth* , with a *short* *overhang* at the *front* and rear to help you *cross* shal*low* *rivers* and *fords* .
the ***car*** has *achieved* the **top** 5 - star *rating* with more **emergency** ***braking*** and **stability** *****control***** *system*s than you could wave a stick at ****—**** plus a *pedestrian* *airbag* .
a *comfortable* and *comforting* *interior* with a *commanding* view of the road *ahead* and *ample* head and *legroom* in the back .
it goes on sale on *january* *22* , with first *deliveries* *set* for late *february* .
not the *cheapest* **4x4** by far and the ' *extra*s ' will soon *mount* up . you are *paying* a hefty *premium* for the badge and the *engine*ering *expertise* behind it .
only the ***2.2*** litre @entity2 diesel ***version*** will be on sale in the @entity21 , no *petrol* **option** .
there will be a ' *greener* ' two - **wheel** - *drive* ***version*** soon , *producing* a *119g/km* and *costing* less than £ *30,000* . ***great*** for looking the part , but *frankly* if you *'re* going to *buy* a **proper** @entity0 , why have one that ******'s****** not a **4x4** ?
the hill ***descent*** *****control***** *button* needs to be more *prominent* so you could *whack* it into play in *transit* ****—**** when you *suddenly* *realise* you need it ****—**** rather than *groping* to find it .
