a geese tsunami was the colourful description given by a @entity3 cameraman after he filmed an extraordinary natural sight in @entity5 , @entity3			1
@entity6 was filming thousands of birds who had landed on a baseball field to take a break just south of @entity11 in @entity12 during their annual migration			1
the sea of geese was impressive enough , but then they took off - those at the back went first with the others following as if they had choreographed their departure to look like a giant wave			0
while @entity32 marvelled at the sight , one woman at the end of his video is seen checking her hair for an unfortunate deposit from one of the birds			2
mr @entity6 said : ' i was spared and not even one of their poop touched me but the lady at the end of the video was not that lucky			0
' @entity54 , of the @entity55 , told @entity56 he was not surprised to see the large gaggle of geese travelling together as they are known to ' stick together '			0
take - off : suddenly the geese at the back take flight before those in front follow , creating a tsunami effect spectacular : the thousands of geese continue their migration south from @entity5 , @entity3 @entity54 said geese are very family oriented , particularly remaining in large groups for migration and feeding purposes			1
he said the area where the geese landed could accommodate up to 70,000 geese .			0
