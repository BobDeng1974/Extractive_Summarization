@entity0 hailed his two - goal star striker @entity1 after @entity2 romped to a 4 - 1 victory at home to @entity5			1
@entity1 scored two outstanding second - half goals to ease the @entity7 to victory at the @entity9 after a nervy opening half - hour			1
@entity2 gained an early lead through @entity12 before @entity14 top scorer @entity13 drew the @entity5 level			1
@entity1 rounds @entity16 before scoring his side 's third goal at the @entity9 @entity19 reels away in celebration as he celebrates his goal against @entity5 in the lunchtime kick off but @entity23 nudged @entity2 back into the lead before @entity1 's brilliant brace			1
' @entity1 deserves those goals for his work rate and he showed great confidence in the way he took both of them , ' said @entity0			1
' it was massive to win , we needed a performance today and i thought we were brilliant against a good , strong team			0
@entity5 left - back @entity37 runs with the ball as a tackle comes in from @entity40 ' we 've played against a very strong team who finished the game with four strikers and the main thing is that we 're eight points ahead of them in seventh			2
' to be eight points ahead of them is a good situation for us			0
' @entity2 's first two goals came from set plays , and the @entity53 added : ' we 've been working on our set - pieces this week and it was brilliant how the first two goals came from them			1
' we 've put the points on the board in the early kick - off and that was important			0
' some of our performances of late have not been the best but today we did very well			0
maybe some people expected us to be bad but we gave the perfect answer			0
' the scoreline arguably flattered @entity2 , who have won and lost three out of their last six games but went back to the top of the table before other fixtures on saturday afternoon			0
@entity23 strikes for goal in the @entity5 looked bright in the first half and hit the post with the score at 1 - 1			1
@entity5 boss @entity75 said : ' we worked on defending corners and conceded two goals from them			2
' we were great in the first half and second half we were undone by a really good goal by @entity1 , it 's great play by him			2
' i 'll take responsibility after 3 - 1			2
i threw strikers on , we were all over the place and a bit of a shambles at the end			0
we 're organised at corners normally and should n't concede			0
' it looked a bit shambolic at the end as we pushed forward and i 'll take responsibility for that			0
' automatic promotion is looking hard now , we 're not going to win three more games than two or three teams between now and the end of the season			1
