by @entity0 @entity1 , 17 , died after he developed a tear in his aorta and collapsed while watching tv with his father a ' fit and healthy ' schoolboy has died at just 17 because he had a rare and undiagnosed heart condition which usually affects elderly men			1
a-level student @entity1 collapsed while watching tv at home with his father and passed away in hospital			1
tests revealed the privately educated teenager - a talented musician and actor - had suffered an ' aortic dissection ' - a rupturing of the largest artery in the human body			1
the condition usually only affects men aged 65 and over who have a history of high blood pressure			1
now a fundraising page set up by @entity1 ’s family with the @entity25 has already raised more than £ 10,000 as they campaign for more money to be spent on researching sudden heart defects amongst young men			1
@entity1 , who died earlier this month , attended the prestigious @entity30 near @entity31 and had been offered a place at @entity33 to read american studies			1
his father @entity35 , 52 , a @entity36 executive from @entity37 , near @entity38 , said : ' @entity1 had a very busy life and social life and there was nothing at all to indicate there could be anything to worry about			1
' there must be young kids and their families who could get better support to find the potential cause of what killed @entity1			1
' he was a lovely boy and was just the most thoughtful and caring person and he brought joy and sunshine into people ’s lives			0
' he was quite a character across the school and not just in his school year			0
we have had hundreds of cards and letters			0
he used to help younger children with music			0
' he was one of those characters that was thoughtful and kind and very happy which has been comforting in what has been a horrendous two weeks following his death			0
' the reaction from friends and fellow pupils has confirmed what we already knew ; what a fantastic person he was and how loved he was			0
' @entity1 was rushed to hospital and doctors fought to save him but they were unable to do so @entity1 - a keen singer and guitarist - was studying @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 and at his school performed in stage productions of @entity83 and @entity84			1
the tragedy occurred two days after @entity1 had complained of a pain in his back			1
it was thought he had pulled a muscle and he took some painkillers but just 48 hours later he became unwell and was rushed into hospital			1
his mother @entity92 , 46 , a production executive for @entity93 said : ' @entity1 initially did n’t complain of pains in his heart or chest , he said it was his back			1
an aortic dissection is a dangerous condition in which a tear develops in the inner layer of the aorta			1
blood is able to surge through this tear into the middle layer of the blood vessel , causing the inner and middle layers to be separated			2
this creates a blood - filled channel and if this ruptures through the outside of the aorta 's wall , the condition is usually fatal			1
the condition is rare and is most common in men between the ages of 60 and 70			2
symptoms are similar to those of other conditions meaning diagnosis is often slow			0
early treatment dramatically improves the prognosis			0
symptoms include sudden chest or upper back pain , loss of consciousness , breathlessness , sweating and difficulty speaking			2
the condition is more likely to develop in people with chronic high blood pressure as well as in those born with a weakened aorta			1
an aortic dissection can be fatal but it can also lead to organ damage and strokes			1
source : @entity137 ' but it seems the reason why he had the pain on his back was because the aorta runs near the spine			0
on the night he collapsed , the ambulance arrived quickly and they were in the house for quite some time trying to revive him			2
' they took him to @entity152 and doctors tried for another thirty minutes there but could n’t revive him			0
what happened to @entity1 was just a bolt from the blue			2
. nobody would have thought to look for the condition he had			0
' mrs @entity160 added : ' if you were happy , @entity1 was happy			2
he just had the most infectious giggle and laughed all the time and sometimes you did n’t know what the joke was but you laughed along with him			0
he always made people feel happy and was always smiling			0
' at his funeral we asked people to donate to the fundraising site rather than bring flowers			0
' we have received so many cards and letters from friends we never even met telling us stories about @entity1 , how thoughtful and kind he was , numerous things he did for people			2
' it has been overwhelming but comforting too to know how loved he was by everyone			0
' @entity178 , headmistress at @entity179 , said : ' @entity1 was a dearly loved and trusted friend , showing remarkable compassion and understanding through his work as a @entity183 , coaching younger students through their first year at the school			2
' his passions lay in music and drama and he was a valued cast member of many school productions and singing groups			0
' the way in which the school community has come together to grieve for him and to celebrate his life has been humbling and inspiring			0
