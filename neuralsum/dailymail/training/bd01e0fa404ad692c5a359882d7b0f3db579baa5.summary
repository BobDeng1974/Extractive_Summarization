by @entity0 published : 10:11 est , 9 november 2012 updated : 13:26 est , 9 november 2012 the days of wives receiving multi-million pound divorce payouts from wealthy husbands could be numbered after one of the country 's top family judges slammed such claims			2
lord justice @entity8 said payouts in ' big money ' divorces , where wives feel it is ' reasonable ' to ask for millions to maintain the lifestyle they are accustomed to , should be consigned to history , adding : ' we only talk about " needs " when there is n't a lot to go round			1
' the judge made the comments when presiding over a case in which multi-millionaire hotel boss @entity22 , is battling to get a £ 2.75million divorce payout awarded to his ex-wife @entity24 cut			1
@entity24 ( left ) leaving the @entity26			0
she is involved in a bitter divorce battle with her multi-millionaire hotelier ex-husband @entity28 ( right ) mr @entity22 was ' in love ' with his business , the @entity31 , in exclusive @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , and described himself as ' a force of nature ' to judge @entity36 who made the award to his ex-wife			1
she helped run the hotel for 13 years before the couple split , and in august last year , judge @entity36 recognised her contribution to the success of the business when he awarded her a £ 2.2million lump sum , plus the £ 550,000 former matrimonial home , in @entity47 , @entity48			2
that payout was largely made up of a one - third share in the £ 6m value of the hotel building and business			1
mr @entity22 reacted angrily to the award , insisting that - whilst his wife was ' the second best receptionist ' he ever had - she should not get a share of the hotel 's value because she was just a paid employee who ' simply did her duties '			1
today he asked @entity8 , @entity61 and @entity62 sitting in @entity34 's @entity26 to slash her payout			1
mr @entity22 , 50 , married his @entity65 wife , 39 , in 2005 , and they had two children , but the couple had been together - with mrs @entity24 working up to 17 hours - a - day helping run the hotel business - since 1997			1
however they split after just four years of marriage			0
lord justice @entity8 said payouts in ' big money ' divorces should be consigned to history the court heard the hotel had been passed to mr @entity22 and his two sisters by their parents , and @entity22 and mrs @entity24 bought out his siblings ' shares during their marriage			1
having heard that @entity83 had assessed mrs @entity24 ' claim , ' in terms of pure need ' , at £ 1.55million and had then upped her payout to £ 2.7million because of her contribution to the success of the hotel , @entity8 said : ' any mention of needs is completely inappropriate in a case of this scale			1
we only talk about needs when there is n't a lot to go round			0
' in a case like this , which is loosely categorised as ' big money ' , needs should not make much of a contribution to judicial reasoning			1
' the bigger the family fortune , the less relevant needs became			0
in big money cases , the wife will often get twice what she needs			2
i do n't see what bearing needs have in this case			2
' @entity114 , for mr @entity22 , argued that the hotel had been a ' gift ' by mr @entity22 ' parents , @entity118 and @entity119 , to their children , and the judge had over-estimated the value of the ex-wife 's contribution			1
' the affairs of the @entity31 were at all times kept separate			0
the wife had no say in how the business was run , or any share in the profits - rather , she was paid a wage , ' the barrister said , adding that judge @entity36 had been wrong when he found that the business was ' entirely valueless ' in 1997 before @entity22 and mrs @entity24 began working there together			1
saying that , before the wife had any input , the business had produced a post tax profit of £ 250,000 , the barrister said : ' the judge found that the hotel was wholly valueless in 2007			2
in reality it was a cash generator			0
' insisting that the couple had done no more than take advantage of the valuable gift provided by mr @entity22 ' parents , the barrister added : ' they did n't add value to the business - they just took what was there and exploited it			1
' @entity83 accepted the wife 's evidence that she had basically turned the business around - she takes credit for the great rise in company turnover			0
mr @entity22 asked @entity8 , @entity61 and @entity62 sitting in @entity34 's @entity26 to slash his wife 's payout ' but the value of the hotel business has varied in relation to the state of the economy , and there was nothing to suggest that the wife contributed to the value of the business , ' mr @entity114 said			1
in her evidence to @entity83 , mrs @entity175 said she and her husband had ' worked ceaselessly ' to transform a ' dowdy and unwelcoming ' hotel with ' no sense of customer service ' into a successful and lucrative business			2
' we threw ourselves into it wholeheartedly , ' mrs @entity24 told the court , explaining why she felt she was entitled to a share of the value of the business			0
' mr @entity22 was burning to make the hotel work			1
he was in love with the hotel			0
his characterisation of his wife was as a good employee			0
he said she had been the second best receptionist he had			0
' judge @entity36 she said she had built and designed the hotel 's first website and transformed its advertising , as well as working extremely long hours , whilst living with mr @entity22 in a 9 ' x8 ' room on the premises before they bought their home			1
@entity203 , for mrs @entity24 , said : ' the husband in his case was seeking to diminish the wife 's contribution and in that he failed squarely			0
' he added that , by virtue of her hard work at the hotel , as well as raising a family , the wife deserved every penny of her award , regardless of whether or not her ' reasonable needs ' had been over-estimated			0
' when one comes to look at fairness , which is the touchstone of all these cases , this award is at the low end , bearing in mind that this was a lady who made a very active contribution to the business for 13 years and when the marriage broke down was left with two children , ' said mr @entity228			0
judge @entity36 , in his ruling last year , had acknowledged mr @entity22 ' fierce love for his business , and observed : ' there is a third party in the relationship - the @entity31			2
' ' mr @entity22 was burning to make the hotel work			1
he was in love with the hotel			0
his characterisation of his wife was as a good employee			0
he said she had been the second best receptionist he had			0
' although mr @entity22 had at one time been ' head over heels in love with her ' , the judge said there was now ' no real acknowledgment by him of her commitment to him both before and after the marriage			2
' ' he has a great love of the hotel and a strong sense of entitlement to it			0
' dealing with mr @entity22 ' view of his ex-wife 's role at the hotel , the judge said : ' it was his case that , because she had been paid as an employee , she had simply done her duties			1
' @entity262 , @entity61 and @entity62 reserved their decision on mr @entity22 ' appeal , to be delivered at a later date .			2
