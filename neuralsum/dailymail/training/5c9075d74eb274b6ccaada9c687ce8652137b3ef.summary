by @entity1 reporter published : 17:41 est , 11 august 2013 updated : 09:00 est , 12 august 2013 they might taste scrumdiddlyumptious , but new @entity4 chocolate bars pack more calories than almost any other brand			2
about to be launched by @entity9 , @entity4 ’s @entity8 bar has 555 calories in every 100g – more than rivals from @entity12 to @entity14 ice cream			1
health campaigners say the calorie count is ‘ unimaginable ’ and warn it could have a devastating effect on children ’s health			2
@entity20 : @entity21 's @entity4 bars - based on the @entity23 novel about the adventures inside a chocolate factory - pack a whopping 555 calories decadent : the bars come in three flavours , @entity8 , @entity30			1
they contain more than a quarter of the recommended daily calorie intake @entity9 hopes to capitalise on the continuing popularity of @entity23 ’s @entity34 with three flavours of @entity36 , even borrowing the author ’s vocabulary to call it ‘ scrumdiddlyumptious ’			1
but it says the core market will be women in their 30s and 40s			0
small versions of the @entity30 versions – under 40g – go on sale next month			0
the 100g bars launching in october include the @entity8 version with 555 calories			0

even the least calorific of the three @entity4 flavours , the @entity54 bar , has 524 calories per 100g – more than a quarter of the recommended daily calorie intake for women			1
