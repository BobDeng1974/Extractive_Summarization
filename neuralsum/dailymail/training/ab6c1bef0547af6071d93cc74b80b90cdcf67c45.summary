@entity1 students will take part in a media studies course funded by taxpayers , amid fears they could just learn how to pedal propaganda about @entity7 because the regime controls the media			1
more than 40 students from @entity1 will take part in a media course in the @entity13 , funded by @entity13 taxpayers			1
the course , which has been organised by the @entity16 , aims to show students how @entity13 media works as well as teach them how to build websites			1
but there are fears the training will merely give the 46 students the means to pedal propaganda for @entity1 leader @entity7 , because the media is notoriously tightly controlled in the country			1
@entity29 of @entity30 , chairman of the @entity31 on @entity1 , has accused the foreign office of ' investing in people who are official mouthpieces of the regime , ' the @entity28 reported			1
the @entity16 has confirmed it is funding the project , which will be delivered by the @entity37 and is called ' @entity38 : working in @entity1 to connect its journalists to an internet world			1
' there are claims it could cost Â£ 70,000			0
but the @entity16 said no figures for the course had been finalised , and said it was being run as part of the ' critical engagement ' activities with the country			1
in a written answer to the @entity53 baroness @entity51 said ' the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) maintains extremely tight control over media and restricts access to foreign broadcasting			1
' she added : ' the project aims to expose participants to the @entity13 media , instructing them on international reporting practices and the development of technical skills to build websites using a variety of international sources			1
' the students took part in a pilot workshop in @entity71 in october			2
the study tour to the @entity13 will take place in early 2015			2
journalists have to be a member of the @entity83 and prove that they come from families with reliable political backgrounds			0
there is just one agency service for the country			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity16 said : ' the @entity13 has worked tirelessly to raise awareness of horrifying human rights violations in @entity1			1
last month , the international community condemned these abuses with a strong resolution in the @entity95			0
news of the death of former @entity1 leader @entity98 took two days to be released because of the tight controls on the media in the country that sees what can be reported as restricted by the regime the @entity16 confirmed it would be funding the media training for the 47 students from @entity1 ' this project is an example of the type of international exposure recommended by the @entity95 @entity110 into human rights in the @entity1			1
it is just one part of our critical engagement to try to improve the lives of those who live in @entity1			1
' a @entity95 report earlier this year found that @entity1 are not able to express opinions that are critical of the regime or its official ideology			2
it said : ' there is an almost complete denial of the right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion , as well as of the rights to freedom of opinion , expression , information and association			0
' the report said that propaganda is used by the @entity137 to create obedience to the leader and that no expression of criticism of the political system goes unpunished , with public executions and people being sent to prison camps known as the ' ultimate ' punishments			0
an example of the extent the state controls the press was seen when @entity98 died in 2011 , but it took two days for news of the death of the former leader to be released			0
@entity1 is one of the most controlling media environments in the world			2
all news outlets are controlled by the state and information flowing into and out of the country is monitored			2
there is just one news agency , the @entity164 , that operates throughout the country			0
internet access is poor , with many north @entity1 only able to access a form of an intranet			1
but mobile phones have appeared after a ban was lifted in 2008			0
radios and televisions supplied to @entity1 come pre-tuned to @entity174 - controlled stations such as @entity175			2
since @entity7 took over from his father in 2011 there have been attempts to improve media access and information flowing from the country			2
this has included an interview @entity184 gave to @entity185 after travelling to the country earlier this year , following a previous trip where he struck up an unlikely friendship with @entity7			0
but a lot of the news coming from north @entity1 has been seen as being staged and managed , merely to just imply access has improved			1
@entity1 also allowed @entity193 prisoners to be interviewed by the news channel , but the process again seemed controlled as the prisoners appeared to have been coached about what to say as they asked @entity193 officials for help			2
a photo released by @entity202 shows @entity7 at military training before the death of @entity98 residents were bombarded with positive news about the former leader , such as his visits to industrial projects			0
information about the country 's economic difficulties of famines are not generally reported to domestic audiences			0
in 2013 some controls were relaxed as visitors were allowed to bring their mobile phones into the country			0
however calls between locals and foreigners are still prohibited			0
a black market , reportedly at the border with @entity224 , appears to be in operation and enables @entity1 to watch some @entity227 shows .			0
