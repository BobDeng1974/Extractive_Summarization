by @entity0 published : 14:33 est , 21 august 2013 updated : 16:11 est , 21 august 2013 sniff ... sniff ... bump ! this was the moment two aardvarks crashed into each other as they tried to follow their noses to each other in the glare of the day			1
the nocturnal creatures are rarely spotted in the daytime but had woken up and were snuffling around in tall grasses for food			2
smells interesting ... the aardvarks pick up each other 's scents with their long snouts i do n't think it 's an ant ... the animals edge closer and closer to one another until ... @entity19 ! the two bemused aardvarks crash into each other amid the grass in the @entity24 reserve the animals used their acute sense of hearing and smell to walk closer to each other , but failed at the last hurdle and crashed headlong			1
the two anteaters , which can see no further than the end of their noses in daylight , then stood up on their hind legs and greeted one another			0
the moment was captured on camera by @entity40 amateur photographer @entity39 , at the @entity42 reserve in @entity24			1
it is incredibly unusual to capture two aardvarks together in the same picture due to their secretive nature and nocturnal habits			1
mr @entity39 , 27 , from @entity48 , @entity49 , said : ' i was with a group of tourists when we saw an aardvark			0
fancy meeting you here ! photographer @entity39 wondered if the two creatures were being aggressive , but decided they were just making friends hidden away : it is very unusual to see aardvarks together in the wild , especially during the day , as they are nocturnal ' we followed it but it darted in and out of a thicket , so we went to leave when we saw it come out of the other side			1
' then i realised there was another aardvark there and i was really excited			0
i grabbed my camera because it 's something you do n't normally see			0
' aardvarks can only see to the end of their noses and they were moving towards each other , so much that they almost bumped into one another			2
' they then started doing movements which must have been for greeting one another , although i did wonder if it was aggressive at first			0
' i think they were showing friendship			0
' although aardvarks are widespread throughout @entity88 they have a pretty low density and are rarely seen because they are nocturnal			1
' they are hard to photograph because of this and it is almost unheard of to get a picture of two			0
' anteater antics : the animals were spotted at the @entity42 , a private game reserve in @entity24 that spreads over more than 100,000 hectares the word aardvark ( @entity101 name orycteropus afer ) comes from the @entity102 and loosely translates as ' earth pig ' or ' ground pig '			1
the animals can grow to up to 140lbs in weight and 4.3ft long and have an elongated snout which they use to find food			2
aardvarks survive on a diet of ants and termites which they catch using their extremely long , sticky tongues .			0
