aged just 13 , that was not an option			0
but @entity4 would not take no for an answer			2
in 1915 , without telling his father @entity26 , the mature - looking newspaper delivery boy from east @entity25 fashioned himself as a fresh - faced 17 - year - old and stood up to serve			0

the official document informed @entity45 that her 16 - year - old son @entity4 was to be posthumously awarded the highest decoration for valour for his heroics in @entity12 , and invited her to receive it at @entity51			1

' historic : a letter from @entity39 describing the incredible bravery of one of the youngest recipients of the @entity43 to his grieving mother has come to light the teenager had lied about his age to join the @entity17 at 15 so he could serve along with his father and elder brother in the war effort			1

@entity9 was hit by 18 150mm shells			0
although the ship was never in danger of sinking , the scene on deck was one of horror as many of the gun crews had lost lower limbs in the bombardment			0
