by @entity0 published : 11:34 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 16:39 est , 6 december 2012 @entity2 ’s chief executive has admitted his surprise that @entity4 has not sued the search giant			1
‘ it 's extremely curious that @entity4 has chosen to sue @entity2 's partners and not @entity2 itself , ' said @entity2 ceo @entity9			1
he claimed he was trying to deal with the enmity between the two tech giants in an ‘ adult ’ way but that things were still strained			1
he also acknowledged that the public think they are like two angry teenagers taunting each other with the words : ‘ i have a gun , you have a gun , who shoots first ? ' @entity9 , ceo of @entity2 , has admitted the firm 's relationship with @entity4 has soured to point the firms are ' throwing bombs at each other ' one of the biggest current rows between the firms is over mapping software , after @entity4 decided to dump @entity2 and create its own maps			1
however , the firm has struggled , and was forced to issue a humiliating apology to customers			2
@entity2 is developing its own map app for @entity4 's gadgets , but has not revealed when it will be released			1
relations between @entity2 and @entity4 have been arctic long before the death of @entity4 founder @entity40 , who made it his personal mission to take down his rival			1
in his biography of @entity40 , who died in october last year , @entity44 revealed that once raged he would ‘ go to thermonuclear war ’ to get revenge for stealing @entity4 designs			0
@entity40 supposedly said : ‘ our lawsuit is saying , ' @entity2 you f * * * * * * ripped off the @entity53 , wholesale ripped us off			1
‘ i will spend my last dying breath if i need to , and i will spend every penny of @entity4 's $ 40bn ( £ 25bn ) the bank , to right this wrong			0
' i 'm going to destroy @entity59 , because it 's a stolen product			0
’ more recently @entity4 stopped using @entity61 on the @entity53 and the new @entity62 and removed @entity2 ’s @entity63 as an icon from the home screen too in an escalation of hostilities			1
speaking to the @entity68 , @entity9 , who is @entity2 ’s executive chairman , said that over the past year things had been ‘ on and off ’ with @entity4			1
he said : ‘ obviously , we would have preferred them to use our maps			0
‘ they threw @entity63 off the home screen ( of iphones and @entity62 )			0
i 'm not quite sure why they did that			0
‘ the press would like to write the sort of teenage model of competition , which is , ' i have a gun , you have a gun , who shoots first ? ' ‘ the adult way to run a business is to run it more like a country			2
‘ they have disputes , yet they 've actually been able to have huge trade with each other			0
according to his biography , @entity40 vowed to ' spend my last dying breath ' defeating @entity59 , @entity2 's mobile phone and tablet software			1
‘ they 're not sending bombs at each other			0
‘ i think both @entity104 ( @entity105 , @entity4 's chief executive ) and @entity106 ( page , @entity2 's chief executive ) the sort of successors to @entity40 ( @entity110 ) and me if you will , have an understanding of this state model			2
‘ when they and their teams meet , they have just a long list of things to talk about			0
’ another twist to the @entity4 and @entity2 row is the patent lawsuit that @entity4 brought against @entity121 over its @entity123 smartphone			2
earlier this year a @entity125 jury awarded @entity4 $ 1bn ( £ 622m ) because they thought that @entity121 had ripped off its designs			0
lawyers for both companies used ripe language to accuse the other of theft with @entity4 alleging that @entity121 ‘ flagrantly copied ’ its products			0
observers have however suggested that the lawsuit was a ‘ proxy war ’ and that @entity4 may yet sue @entity2 directly			2
asked about the ongoing legal action , @entity9 said : ‘ @entity4 and @entity2 are well aware of the legal strategies of each other			1
‘ part of the conversations that are going on all the time is to talk about them			0
‘ it 's extremely curious that @entity4 has chosen to sue @entity2 's partners and not @entity2 itself			2
