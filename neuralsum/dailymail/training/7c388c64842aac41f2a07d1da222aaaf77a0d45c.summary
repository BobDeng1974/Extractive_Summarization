in fact , the @entity6 judge , 39 , famously dubbed @entity2 when the @entity8 formed in 1994 , said : ' i 'd like to think i 'm a bit scary every now and again			1
' the mother - of - three told @entity12 that it was a magazine , not the girls themselves , who coined their nicknames but more than 20 years later after the group formed , ' she would n't change it for the world '			1
the name fits : former @entity8 member @entity2 ( pictured in september ) has revealed that even though she did n't give herself the moniker ' @entity2 ' , she does like to think she 's ' a bit scary every now an again ' ' i 'd like to think i 'm a bit scary every now and again			1
i would n't change my name for the world			0
we never named ourselves - it was a magazine , and the nicknames stuck			2
i do n't think you can mess with that , so i 'm sticking with mine			0

but everyone 's doing their own thing and everyone has families to consider			2

yet she prefers not to call herself a feminist			0
instead , ' i try to live by the girl - power motto , ' she explained			1
