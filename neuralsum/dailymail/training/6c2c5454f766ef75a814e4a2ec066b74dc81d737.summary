by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 15:51 est , 26 november 2013 @entity3 : 06:28 est , 27 november 2013 @entity4 has forced 60 minutes correspondent @entity5 and her producer to take a leave of absence due to their discredited story about the attack on the @entity11 embassy in @entity12			1
the move comes after a critical internal review of the controversial october segment which relied heavily on the testimony of a supposed witness whose account has now been proved as false			2
the review by @entity22 executive @entity21 said the @entity30 team - and specifically @entity24 and her producer @entity25 - should have done a better job vetting the former security contractor later identified as @entity29			1
producer : @entity25 was also put on a leave of absence starting on tuesday for his involvement in the story ' @entity24 and producer @entity25 told me they found no reason to doubt @entity29 ’ account and found no holes in his story			1
but the team did not sufficiently vet @entity29 ’ account of his own actions and whereabouts that night , ' the report stated			2
the report also said @entity24 should not have done the story in the first place after making a speech in @entity59 a year ago claiming that it was a lie that @entity11 's military had tamed @entity62			1
' from a @entity65 perspective , there is a conflict in taking a public position on the government ’s handling of @entity12 and @entity62 , while continuing to report on the story , ' @entity21 concluded , as seen in the full memo published on the @entity72			0
@entity22 chairman @entity73 , who is also the @entity30 executive producer , said he had asked @entity24 and @entity25 to take a leave of absence of an undetermined length			1
@entity73 said he prides himself on catching almost everything , ' but this deception got through and it should n't have			0
' there was no word about whether @entity73 will face any repercussions for his role			0
' the 60 minutes journalistic review is concluded , and we are implementing ongoing changes based on its results , ' said @entity22 spokeswoman @entity87 , not making clear what those changes were			0
under scrutiny : an internal review concluded that @entity24 and her producer should have vetted the source more thoroughly and used other channels at @entity4 to get more information from government sources the original segment relied heavily on the testimony of @entity29 - who went by the pseudonym that he used while writing a book about his version of events , @entity98 - said that he scaled a 12 foot wall and fought off a terrorist when he arrived at the consulate on the evening of the attack			1
he also said that he later saw the body of ambassador @entity110 when he went to a local hospital that evening			0
the newsmagazine believed his account that he was at the scene even after informing @entity4 that he told his employers that he was n't there — something that @entity21 said should have raised a ' red flag ' about his story			2
' this crucial point – his admission that he had not told his employer the truth about his own actions – should have been a red flag in the editorial vetting process , ' the report stated			0
in hiding : @entity29 told a story that has now been proved to be false during a @entity30 interview and has since received death threats against his family @entity24 has not made any statement regarding her suspension , which was announced on tuesday as many people started heading out of town for the @entity138 holiday , but she was then one to make two public apologies less than a week after the original segment aired			1
@entity24 said during her on - air mea culpa on november 8 that they were aware of the discrepancy between the version of events that he was telling @entity4 and the @entity149 report			1
before they aired the piece he told them that he lied in the company ’s report to go along with his boss ’ story which said that @entity29 tried going to the mission but there were roadblocks and he could n’t make it			1
' his boss is someone he cared about enormously			0
he cared about his @entity11 counterparts in the mission that night , and when his boss told him not to go , he could n't stay back			2
so that was always part of the record for us , ’ @entity24 said			2
she made it clear that what they did not know was that @entity29 had given that account to the @entity172 in their incident report			1
his involvement with the @entity172 report came via the @entity176 after the 60 minutes piece aired , and @entity24 said that when they confronted him over the claims , he denied it			1
@entity24 said that they have since tried contacting @entity29 about the situation and they have not been able to get in touch with him			1
mea culpa : @entity24 said on november 8 ( pictured ) that they were wrong to air her interview with a man called @entity29 who lied about his role on the night of the attacks on the @entity11 mission to @entity12 ‘ we were misled and we were wrong and that 's the important thing and that 's what we have to say here : we have to set the record straight and take responsibility , ’ she said			1
' the most important thing to every person at 60 minutes is the truth , and today the truth is we made a mistake			0
that 's very disappointing for any journalist , that 's very disappointing for me			0
‘ nobody likes to admit that they made a mistake , but if you do , you have to stand up and take responsibility and you have to say that you were wrong and in this case we were wrong			0
’ @entity29 motivation to lie presumably has something to do with the fact that he is coming out with a book about alleged warnings that he gave the @entity11 government about security flaws before the attack			1
the publisher of the book , @entity227 , has now said that they have retracted the book			0
pulled : the publisher announced on friday that it will stop selling @entity232 ' book it had already been on sale online and an unknown number of people had already bought the book			0
@entity238 announced that ' in light of information that has been brought to our attention ' they will no longer be selling the book			0
the book itself was another problem for ' @entity30 ' because while they did disclose that @entity29 had a book that was being published , they failed to mention that @entity248 is an imprint of @entity238 which is owned by @entity4			1
@entity250 said that they got a statement from @entity29 who said that his book is ' consistent ' with what he told @entity11 authorities and the @entity172 , but their own reporter said that there were discrepancies between his book and official reports			1
when asked about what steps they took to vet that @entity29 was telling the truth before they put him on air , @entity24 said that they did independent research and also used material that he provided			2
' we verified that he was who he said he was , that he was working for the @entity273 at the time , that he was in @entity12 at the @entity275 compound the night of the attack , ' she said on @entity4 ' morning news show			2
' he gave us access to communications that he had with government officials			0
we used @entity11 government reports and congressional testimony to verify many of the details of his story and everything checked out			2
he also showed us photographs that he had taken at the @entity275 compound the following morning			0
' watch the video here			0

@entity30 aired an interview with a security contractor who claimed to rush over to the @entity11 consulate after the attack began in 2012
after the interview with @entity29 aired , @entity4 learned that @entity29 told the @entity172 a different version of events
@entity24 apologized for being ' misled ' less than a week after the segment aired on october 27 but today @entity4 announced her leave of absence
