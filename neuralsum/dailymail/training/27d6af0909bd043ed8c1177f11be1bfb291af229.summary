five years ago this week a devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit @entity1 , the capital of @entity2 , all - but obliterating the city in the process			1
the tremor , the strongest to hit the island since 1770 , killed 300,000 , left 1.5million homeless and destroyed 60 per cent of the country 's government buildings - including the @entity9			0
but despite £ 8.6billion being handed over in donations and foreign aid since the crisis began , much of the country still lies in ruins or is waiting to be rebuilt			1
the old structure has been cleared away , part of the 19million cubic metres of rubble which was removed after the disaster , but the new building has not been started yet			0
elsewhere the city 's cathedral is still nothing more than a series of half - demolished walls , just as it appeared in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake			1
thousands of desperate @entity2 arrived in the days following january 12 , 2010 , to shelter under tarpaulins in the ruins of the holy building			1
the tent cities became a hotbed of cholera which spread among the ruins of @entity1 , which was at severe risk from flooding			1
destroyed : almost 1.5million people were left homeless , with many thousands taking refuge in the city 's destroyed cathedral			1
five years on , some of them are still there ( pictured in 2010 above , and today below ) while 95 per cent of those people have now been rehoused , the cathedral still lies in ruins , and there is also evidence of people still living up against its walls			1
in another set of images from a local market , little difference is visible between 2010 and today save that a few splintered power lines have been cleared away			2
meanwhile the flattened @entity64 has been cleared away , though little more than a corrugated iron fence stands in its place			0
one of the few structures to have been fully rebuilt is @entity68 after one of @entity2 's biggest employers , @entity71 , stepped forward to provide funding			2
flattened : the @entity9 was destroyed in the quake , along with 60 per cent of the country 's government buildings			2
today there is little more than a flagpole to mark where it once stood the market 's old green and red metal frame has been replaced , while the walls surrounding it have also been repaired and traders have returned to sell their wares			0
however , it is clear that officials who promised in the weeks after the disaster that the city would be ' built back better ' have fallen woefully short of their target			2
@entity1 , a city in which the vast majority of people lived and worked in poorly - built concrete shanty - towns , was virtually razed to the ground when the earthquake struck in 2010			1
eighty per cent of the city 's schools were destroyed , the main hospital collapsed , and a quarter of all public servants perished			2
even before the disaster , nearly three quarters of the population lived on less than $ 2 a day , with half having no access to running water or toilets , so after the earthquake the poverty was acute			0
all gone : this destroyed @entity109 ( pictured above in 2010 ) has now been cleared , but has been replaced by little more than an iron fence ( below ) making a mockery of promises to ' build back better ' poor sanitation lead to a cholera outbreak which killed an estimated 9,000 people as parts of the capital descended into a state of anarchy			1
donations and relief workers flooded in from around the globe to help with the cleanup			0
emergency food needed to be found for 4million people			0
among the first projects to get underway were health clinics , schools and a new power plant to allow the city to function once again			0
however , five years on at least 200,000 people are living in hillside slums around the capital , little more than tin huts without access to running water or electricity			0
despite the best efforts of the global community and officials in the impoverished country , there is still a long way to go			0
rebuilt : one of the few structures to have been fully restored is the city 's @entity68 , which was reconstructed after one of @entity2 's largest employers , @entity71 , put forward the money ( pictured above in 2010 , and today below )			1

@entity1 nearly wiped off the map after 7.0 magnitude quake in 2010
almost £ 8.6billion of foreign aid and *charity* donations handed over
donations helped *pay* for food , medical care and shelter for millions
but five years on large parts of the city have still not been rebuilt
