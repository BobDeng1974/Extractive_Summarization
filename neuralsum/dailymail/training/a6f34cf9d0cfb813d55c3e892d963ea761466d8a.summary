a magnitude 4.8 earthquake shook the northern stretches of @entity3 early this morning , rattling observers of one of the world 's most dangerous supervolcanoes			1
the quake struck near the @entity11 - @entity10 border about 6.30am , in the north - northeast parts of @entity14 's most famous park			1
although the tremor was the most powerful to hit the area in nearly 30 years , @entity17 â€™s @entity16 spokesman @entity15 said it was not expected to cause the @entity20 to erupt			1
if the volcano were ever to erupt , observers say the outflow of lava , ash and smoke would likely devastate the @entity14 and affect the entire world			1
@entity15 said today 's quake , four miles north - northeast of the @entity47 , may have caused only minor damage and that there would n't be many people at the park at the moment			1
the @entity53 reported the quake was felt in the @entity10 border towns of @entity56 and @entity57 , both about 20 miles from the epicenter			1
several smaller quakes , ranging from 2.5 to 3.1 , were also reported in the region this morning			2
@entity56 sees frequent small earthquakes			0
since thursday , there have been at least 25 recorded in the nation 's first national park			0
impact : @entity66 was hit by a 5.1 - magnitude earthquake on friday , two days before a 4.8 - magnitude quake rocked @entity3 in @entity10 meanwhile in @entity66 , experts say a bigger earthquake along the lesser - known fault that gave @entity66 a moderate shake could do more damage to the region than the long - dreaded ' @entity75 ' from the more famous @entity76			1
the @entity77 thrust fault , which brought friday night 's magnitude - 5.1 quake centered in @entity81 and well over 100 aftershocks by today , stretches from northern @entity83 under downtown @entity84 into @entity86 - a heavily populated swath of the @entity84 area			1
a magnitude - 7.5 earthquake along that fault could prove more catastrophic than one along the @entity76 , which runs along the outskirts of metropolitan @entity66 , seismologists told the @entity93			1
the @entity17 estimates that such a quake along the @entity77 fault could kill 3,000 to 18,000 people and cause up to $ 250 billion in damage			2
in contrast , a larger magnitude 8 quake along the @entity76 would cause an estimated 1,800 deaths			2
rocked : customers flee @entity103 as the park is shut down following a 5.1 earthquake in @entity84 on friday destruction : the force of the quake caused this brick wall in @entity110 , @entity66 to collapse on friday in 1987 , the fault caused the @entity113 earthquake			1
still considered moderate at magnitude 5.9 , that quake killed eight people and did more than $ 350 million in damage			1
part of the problem with the potential damage is that the fault runs near so many vulnerable older buildings , many made of concrete , in downtown @entity84 and @entity86			0
and because the fault , discovered in 1999 , is horizontal , heavy reverberations are likely to be felt over a wide area			0
the shaking from a 7.5 quake in the center of urban @entity84 could be so intense it would lift heavy objects in the air , like the 1989 @entity133 in @entity134 , where the shaking was so bad ' we found an upside - down grand piano ' , @entity17 seismologist @entity127 told the @entity93			2
that would ' hit all of downtown , ' @entity138 said			0
' and everywhere from @entity81 to @entity86			0
' wreckage : items in shops in parts of @entity66 toppled from shelves following friday 's magnitude 5.1 earthquake impact : while no injuries were reported in @entity110 , @entity66 , people 's belongings were smashed in some homes about 150 aftershocks , including one of magnitude - 4.1 , were felt since friday night 's quake , which forced several dozen people in the @entity83 city of @entity110 out of their homes after firefighters discovered foundation problems that made the buildings unsafe to enter , authorities said			1
fire crews red - tagged 20 apartment units after finding a major foundation crack			0
structural woes , including broken chimneys and leaning , were uncovered in half a dozen single - family houses , which were also deemed unsafe to occupy until building inspectors clear the structures			0
seventy residents remained displaced , down from 83 after the initial quake			2
another 14 residential structures around the city suffered lesser damage , including collapsed fireplaces			0
a water - main break flooded several floors of @entity181 , and the shaking knocked down computers and ceiling tiles , @entity178 said			2
it was not immediately clear if @entity181 would reopen monday			0
an email to the mayor was not immediately returned			0
off road : in @entity181 , the earthquake triggered a landslide that left this car upside down , with only minor injuries reported			0

*occurred* about 6.30am this morning , four miles north - northeast of the @entity47 in @entity10
observers were concerned the quake would cause supervolcano @entity20 to erupt
no injuries or *significant* damage reported
@entity66 was hit by a 5.1 - magnitude quake on friday , with residents *warned* an even bigger one could follow
it rattled a wide swathe of @entity66 , breaking water mains in a nearby *community* and *prompting* @entity103 to shut down rides
friday 's tremor was the second *sizeable* tremor in two weeks , following a *4.4* quake on march 17
