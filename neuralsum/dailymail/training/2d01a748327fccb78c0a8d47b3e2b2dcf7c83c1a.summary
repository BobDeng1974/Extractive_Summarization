by @entity0 published : 06:46 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 06:46 est , 3 october 2013 for more than 40 years , @entity1 has dominated the plus - size fast fashion market in the @entity3			1
but that could all be about to change			0
@entity6 retailer taking shape arrived this summer , offering ' curvy customers ' a new type of style boasting a ' sassy @entity6 vibe '			1
a huge hit down under where it has 130 shops , the brand aims to open 14 @entity3 stores by the end of october , with boutiques opening in @entity19 and @entity20 this week			1
stylish : taking shape aims to provide an alternative source of fashion for larger ladies by february the brand hopes to have 21 @entity3 stores , including branches in @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			1
' we 're excited to have arrived on the @entity3 high street , ' said taking shape managing director @entity36			1
' we believe that there is a great need here for both our garments and commitment to providing a unique and caring shopping experience			0
' everything we do is about you , the customer , what makes you look good and what makes you feel great			2
' we 're more than just a chain of shops ; our goal is for women to enter as customers and leave as friends ! ' expanding : the @entity6 brand already has 130 stores down under and is now opening one a week in the @entity3 convenient : taking shape is also employing in - store stylists to encourage curvy women to be more daring other innovations introduced by taking shape include turning the fitting rooms into a ' retreat ' that 's larger than the average changing spot , and employing shop assistant stylists with a brief to ensure customers leave looking and feeling as good as possible			1
the newly launched shops and website represent the brand 's first foray into international markets , with the @entity3 chosen because taking shape has a ' greater affinity ' with local @entity3 buyers			1
nevertheless , with only 30 stores planned so far , it 's still a fraction of the size of @entity1 - which has 300 outlets in the @entity3 alone - and lacks the @entity3 brand 's roster of edgy design talent , which currently includes @entity84			1
give colour a chance ' i 've lost count of the number of times i â€™ve heard a customer say " ooh no i never wear that colour " but then i get her into the fitting room and trying on all kinds of colours she would n't normally wear			0
' my tip is : have a play , step out of your comfort zone and try on new colours			0
the right colours for you can make you look healthy and glowing - people will notice and tell you how good you look			2
' @entity105 , layer , layer ' many of us have parts of our body that we are n't fond of - an ample derriere or a pudding tummy are complaints i come across often			2
' the taking shape range is full of cleverly designed styles that help take the focus off these extra assets			2
my tip is : if you layer a long line body tank over trousers it skims lumps and bumps and creates a lean foundation to build an outfit from			0
' add a printed tunic , vest or top and a piece of chunky jewellery and you have an attractive outfit that you 'll feel confident in			0
' @entity133 @entity132 ' straight lines across your body can be less than flattering and accentuate your middle			0
' mixing the lines , lengths and textures of your clothing creates interest in your outfit and distracts the eye			0
my tip is : try asymmetrical hems , crushed fabrics , and textures such as mesh and lace to create stunning outfits			0
