a judge has sparked fury after jailing a rapist who attacked three different women for just nine years , claiming the man did not pose a ' serious ' risk to future victims			1
despite leaving the women ' terrified and shaken ' , @entity8 did not pose the risk of ' serious harm ' , judge @entity7 told @entity12			1
the 28 - year - old from @entity14 had been found guilty of raping two women and harassing another , with the latter two offences taking place while @entity8 was on bail for the first			1
judge @entity7 jailed rapist @entity8 ( right ) for nine years , telling a court the 28 - year - old did not pose a risk of ' serious harm ' despite attacking three women the court heard how @entity8 , a scaffolder , taunted one woman : ' how does it feel to be locked inside a house with a rapist ? ' before raping her , muzzling her cries for help			1
at the time he was on bail after being arrested on suspicion of raping another victim			0
months later he harassed a third woman , pouring a cup of boiling tea over her body and slapping her over the face			2
but despite such ' intimidating and bullying behaviour ' , the aspiring pe teacher was found not to pose a serious enough threat to warrant a longer jail term			1
' in some senses your conduct shows that you may be a dangerous individual but although you are a risk of causing harm you are not at risk of causing serious harm and i trust that after a period in prison those risks will be reduced , ' judge @entity7 told the court			1
' you clearly have a real problem in dealing with relationships with women			2
it may be that you need psychiatric help			0
' the victim personal statements from each of the girls show they were terrified as a result of what you did and are left shaken			0
it may be that the effect on them does not go			0
' the scaffolder raped one woman while on bail for attacking another , taunting her : ' how does it feel to be locked in a house with a rapist ? ' @entity12 ( above ) heard how @entity8 had shown ' bullying and intimidating ' behaviour one of the man 's victims lambasted the sentence as ' a joke '			1
' it is a joke and i do not understand how the judge does not see him as a danger to the public , ' the woman said			1
' i think it â€™s a very light sentence compared to what this man has done			2
the judge has been extremely lenient			2
according to official sentencing guidelines , rape is punishable by jail terms of between four and 19 years			2
the maximum term a judge can hand down is a life sentence			1
courts must however take into consideration the harm and culpability afforded in each case			2
in the most serious cases where there is extreme harm to the victim and a strong element of culpability on the part of the offender , a starting point of 15 years per offence is advised			1
however where there is found to be no residual harm to the victim and little culpability on the part of the offender , a starting point of five years is advised			1
the minimum sentence for rape is four years			1
' @entity8 was smirking and laughing as he went down			2
i suppose i should be just happy because he is not walking the streets anymore			0
' the court had heard how @entity8 raped his first victim after threatening : ' if you want me to show you that i 'm a man i will show you			1
' he went on to bombard the woman with 1,500 text messages in one month			0
he was arrested but released on bail , allowing him to lock a second woman inside his home to rape her			0
@entity130 told police the woman 's muzzled cries were similar to those ' of an animal in pain ' while she was being attacked			0
' he held her down despite her telling him no , he told her to take the pain , ' prosecuting counsel @entity139 said			0
' he covered her mouth to muffle her complaints			0
after he acted as if nothing had happened			0
' the woman grabbed the keys to the door in a bid to flee but was pursued and caught by @entity8 which was witnessed by a neighbour who saw him pick the victim up and carry her back into his house as she screamed for help			2
' later he launched a campaign of harassment on a third victim , pouring scolding tea over her body , slapping her across the face and throwing her over a table			0

he was issued restraining orders banning him from contacting any of the women who brought charges against him			0
@entity167 appeared in court weeks after being released from prison over child pornography charges a spokesman for @entity173 , said victims ' confidence that the legal process will bring offenders to justice is crucial			0
' the criminal justice process can be extremely difficult for survivors of this kind of crime , ' @entity179 , national spokesman for the charity said			0
' if levels of reporting are ever going to significantly increase , survivors of sexual violence need to feel confident that engaging with the criminal justice process is going to be worthwhile			0
' last month judge @entity7 complained at not being able to sentence a paedophile for longer under @entity193 rules			1
in december he jailed @entity167 for eight months for breaking a court order which banned him from accessing the internet			0
the 33 - year - old had been released from prison weeks earlier after being convicted of child pornography offences			1
' this was a very , very deliberate breach ... and if i had the powers , i would undoubtedly have made this sentence consecutive to the current sentence , ' judge @entity7 told @entity205			1
' but @entity193 for reasons best known to itself had abolished the right of judges to return a defendant to custody to serve the balance of a sentence and to impose a term to then be served			0
