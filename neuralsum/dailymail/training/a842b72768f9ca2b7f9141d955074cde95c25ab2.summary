by @entity0 the outlook is sunny for an experimental solar aircraft set to circumnavigate the globe next year , after it has successfully made its maiden flight			1
the @entity5 2 @entity6 took off from @entity8 airbase in @entity9 today and successfully soared above the clouds for more than an hour before landing safely			1
the solar - powered plane has no fuel on board and with a wingspan of 236ft ( 72 metres ) , it is larger than a @entity18 747 - @entity17 jet liner			2
it weighs around the same as a car at 382 stone ( 2,300kg )			0
@entity23 outlook for the record attempt : the @entity5 2 @entity6 ( pictured ) took off from @entity8 airbase in @entity9 today and successfully soared above the clouds for over an hour before landing safely the revolutionary single - seater aircraft is made of carbon fibre			1
it has a 236ft ( 72 metre ) wingspan - larger than that of the @entity30			2
but it weighs just 2,300kg - equivalent to a car			0
the 17,000 solar cells built into the wings supply four electric motors ( 17.5 cv each ) with renewable energy			1
during the day , the solar cells recharge lithium batteries weighing 2,077lbs ( 633 kg ) which allow the aircraft to fly at night and therefore to have virtually unlimited autonomy			2
no fuel is carried aboard the aircraft			0
it is set to become the first solar - powered plane to fly around the world thanks to its vast wings covered in 17,000 solar cells , which supply four electric motors			1
@entity52 test pilot @entity51 flew the cutting - edge machine , which is the second solar plane in the @entity5			1
he also flew the first prototype aircraft in 2009			0
writing in a blog on the @entity5 website , the team said : ‘ it is a great moment for everyone who has built this revolutionary solar airplane … ' all of this hard work to reach next year our ultimate goal : the attempt of the first round - the - world solar flight ... only powered by solar energy ’			1
the solar aircraft of @entity68 and @entity69 is a single - seater and was flown for over one hour ‘ in line with calculations and simulations , ’ @entity5 said			1
flying high : @entity52 test pilot @entity51 flew the cutting - edge machine , which is the second solar plane in the @entity5 pilots @entity68 and @entity69 will take turns in the single - seater cockpit of the @entity5 2 plane			1
their five month mission is set to begin in march 2015 and last for five months			2
the plane is completely solar - powered with no fuel on - board			2
they will make a 22,000mile ( 35,000km ) journey over approximately 500 flying hours			0
there will be 10 legs , some of which will last for more than five days and nights			0
a team of 60 people will support them			0
the two co-founders of the project will pilot the plane themselves for a record - breaking attempt in 2015			1
before then , there will be several other flights taking place in the coming months so that the plane can be obtain certification			0
mr @entity69 , co-founder , pilot and ceo of @entity5 , said : ‘ this inaugural flight is an important stage - a step closer towards the round - the - world flight			1
‘ it is also a huge emotional step for the entire team and all our partners who have worked on the aircraft			0
@entity113 incorporates a vast amount of new technology to render it more efficient , reliable and in particular better adapted to long haul flights			0
it is the first aircraft which will have almost unlimited endurance			0
' mr @entity68 , founder , president and pilot , said : ‘ throughout such an innovative project , each stage is a leap into the unknown			2
today suspense was at a high ! ‘ the results show that our team of engineers can be very proud of the work it has accomplished during the last 10 years			0
’ high achievers : the @entity5 team said : ' it is a great moment for everyone who has built this revolutionary solar airplane ( pictured ) all of this hard work to reach next year our ultimate goal : the attempt of the first round - the - world solar flight ... only powered by solar energy ' the @entity5 2 @entity6 took off from @entity8 airbase in @entity9 today on course : the solar aircraft ( pictured ) of @entity68 and @entity69 is a single - seater and was flown for over one hour ' in line with calculations and simulations , ' @entity5 said			1
