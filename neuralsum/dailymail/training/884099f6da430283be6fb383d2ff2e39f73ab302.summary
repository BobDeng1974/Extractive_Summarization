it pointed to recent figures from immigration minister @entity80 which showed staff numbers were down by more than 300 in the past four years			2
@entity39 general secretary @entity82 said : ' the staffing crisis in the @entity8 has been obvious for everyone to see and it should n't have taken a committee of mps to force the chief executive to meet us to discuss it			2
' we are still a long way off getting a commitment from the agency that it will work with us to put the proper resources in place to ensure these backlogs do not reoccur year after year			0
' mr @entity82 was ridiculed after claiming the strike was designed to ‘ help the public ’ by alerting management to staff shortages			1
