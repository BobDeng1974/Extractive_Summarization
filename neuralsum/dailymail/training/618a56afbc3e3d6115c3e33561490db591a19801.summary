by @entity0 and @entity1 facing question : sir @entity3 , president of the @entity4 , which allegedly hushed up the arrest of its own chief executive @entity8 's most powerful policing organisation was accused last night of hushing up the arrest of its chief executive			1
@entity11 , 54 , was detained by @entity13 detectives after an extraordinary row at the @entity4			1
the civilian employee was accused of stealing the desk diary of association president sir @entity3 from his @entity18 office			1
even though the matter was dropped @entity19 remains suspended on full pay and could still be sacked for misconduct			1
last night the secretive police body faced questions as to why it did not come clean over the allegations			0
‘ it is absolutely extraordinary that some of the most senior police officers in the land can possibly think it is appropriate to suppress this information , ’ said @entity27 , a @entity27 mp			0
‘ if working relations at the highest level of @entity4 have broken down to this extent i can not see why the taxpayer should be spending large sums keeping them employed			2
‘ if they are going to be involved in operational policing , both locally and nationally , they should be subject to appropriate democratic controls			0
’ the row could not come at a worse time for senior @entity4 members , who are fighting for the existence of an organisation that has pushed for more secrecy around police activities and advised forces against naming people it arrests			2
its @entity54 funding ended last december and many police authorities refused to pay their final fees , leaving it £ 250,000 out of pocket			2
earlier this week police and crime commissioners announced retired military chief sir @entity61 will examine whether it is ‘ fit for purpose ’			0
mr @entity11 , a @entity64 employee , was seconded to @entity4 in 2006 where he was made chief executive and company secretary on up to £ 112,604 a year			1
he came from a role in specialist operations , which is responsible for counter terrorism and vip protection			0
it is understood he was accused of stealing sir @entity3 ’s desk diary , which contained appointments and contacts , in a deliberate act of sabotage			1
mr @entity11 was questioned by detectives but the case was dropped without prosecutors being consulted			1
it is not known whether the diary was recovered			0
mr @entity11 has been replaced by @entity83 from the @entity85 force			2
an @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ @entity11 ’s secondment to @entity4 from the @entity64 has ended and he has returned to his force following an allegation of misconduct			1
‘ this is a normal procedure to allow a disciplinary process to take place			0
’ the case shines a rare light on the divisions and infighting within @entity4 against the background of its opaque structure , lucrative commercial interests and status as a private firm			1
it co-ordinates the sale of information from the police national computer at vast profit and markets ‘ police approval logos ’ for sale on anti-theft devices			0
but its central role in the police structure also enables it to write the rules on how operations are carried out as well as campaigning on key issues			0
led by retired @entity119 chief sir @entity3 , who earns £ 188,736 , it has employed many retired chief officers , often on short - term contracts			1
one of its leading members , @entity126 chief @entity125 , led campaigning for more secrecy around police activities			0
secretive : @entity4 's central role in the police structure enables it to write the rules on how operations are carried out , as well as selling data from the police national computer			2
it has employed many retired chief officers the most recent documents available at @entity138 show @entity4 employs 22 staff and has a wage bill of £ 1.7million			2
it registered assets worth £ 5million , including £ 3.5million in cash , and received a total income of £ 5.8million , including a £ 1million @entity54 grant			0
in an unusual move , staff applied for a special exemption to remove the designation ‘ ltd ’ from @entity4 ’s title earlier this year			1
sir @entity3 has pledged to reform the organisation , admitting its status as a private firm is awkward			1
his critics say little progress has been made .			0
