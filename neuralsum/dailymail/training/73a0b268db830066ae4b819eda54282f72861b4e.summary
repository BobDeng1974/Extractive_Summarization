@entity0 looks ahead to this sunday night ’s contest between the @entity2 and @entity3 , which will be shown live on @entity4			1
the @entity3 lead the way in the @entity6 with two wins from their opening two games this season			1
the @entity2 , meanwhile , will be looking to bounce back from their heavy loss against @entity11 rivals @entity12 last thursday			1
i ’m very excited to have a first look at the @entity3 on @entity4 this season for one reason – @entity16 ( if he plays )			1
he is too big a player to risk but on the flip side he is too big a player not to have in the game			2
ever since we saw a first glimpse of @entity16 at @entity22 , when he won the @entity23 in college , he excited a lot of people in the @entity27			1
he was the start of this new breed of quarterback that it seems @entity32 has made famous – being able to run and pass			0
but i think @entity16 was the originator for this breed			1
if you watch the way he plays , with confidence and a smile on his face , that ’s why it ’s always exciting to see him on our screens			0
@entity3 are 2 - 0 at the moment , and if head coach @entity45 can carry on the momentum from last season then they ’ve got a real chance of getting into the play - offs			1
@entity50 are strong as well			0
they absolutely destroyed the @entity52 on thursday night , and i think the @entity52 will struggle this year			1
@entity16 reacts after throwing a touchdown during the impressive dismantling of the @entity55 @entity16 celebrates with @entity3 fans after victory over @entity55 which took the @entity3 to 2 - 0 but the surprise in that division is the @entity60			1
it ’s not like them to start off 0 - 2 and go on a losing streak straight from the off			1
but i think it gives @entity3 a real opportunity to make some headway in the division and then into the play - offs			1
if @entity16 can get fit and stay fit , then they have a great chance			1
my only concern is that they use @entity73 as their primary receiver since the loss of @entity76 – who joined the @entity12			1
their go - to receiver is a tight end and it ’s debatable whether that can be the case			2
we ’ve seen it with @entity83 and @entity84 in @entity85 , and with @entity86 and @entity87 in @entity88 , but i think @entity3 will miss having a go - to wide receiver			1
@entity16 likes to scramble out of the pocket and that is a great bonus for the receivers because it draws the defensive backs down to the line of scrimmage			1
with @entity16 ’s scrambling ability , it gives the wide receivers the opportunity to stay wide open			1
for the @entity3 to improve , they need to establish the run game			1
they have @entity103 at running back			0
he is averaging 5.1 yards per carry , which is good , but you need a solid run game			2
if you have a running game it asks questions of a defense and their ability to read the run and read the pass			2
@entity73 ( right ) is used as a go - to receiver , and he attempts to evade the @entity55 ' @entity117 if fit , tailback @entity103 , who trained for the first time in a week on friday , is a boon to the offense @entity121 at @entity122 , 6pm @entity123 at @entity124 , 6pm @entity12 at @entity125 , 6pm @entity126 at @entity55 , 6pm @entity127 at @entity128 , 6pm @entity129 at @entity85 , 6pm @entity130 at @entity88 , 6pm @entity131 at @entity132 , 6pm @entity133 at @entity134 , 6pm @entity135 at @entity136 , 6pm @entity137 at @entity138 , 9.05pm @entity139 at @entity140 , 9.25pm @entity141 at @entity142 , 9.25pm @entity2 at @entity3 , 1.30am on the defense , they have @entity144 – what a player ! he has got to be in the top three linebackers in the league			1
@entity144 is the new breed of defensive athlete			0
if you look at his physical build , he ’s 238lbs and that is quite light for a linebacker			0
but he ’s got fantastic speed , knows the game and can read the game very well			2
i would definitely make the @entity3 favourites to win the @entity6 now			2
at the start of the season i would have gone for the @entity60			2
but they lost their quarterback coach @entity162 , who went to @entity55 to become their offensive coordinator			1
even with @entity86 at quarterback they ’ll struggle to catch up with the @entity3			2
if the @entity3 can build momentum and get @entity16 fully fit , i would put money on them to win that division			1
as for @entity2 , the loss to @entity12 was a tough game for everyone because of the @entity174 situation			1
the atmosphere and build - up to the game was n’t around football , it was on an off - field matter that took the shine off that game			2
the hard - hitting @entity144 ( right ) is the defensive rookie of the year and gets to grips with @entity184 the game on sunday against the @entity3 will be crucial for the @entity2 to establish themselves			1
they need to get their running back @entity186 going			0
he ’s averaging 5.3 yards per carry but i do n’t think he looks confident			0
he ’s also their second most successful receiver so they ’re not going deep that much , they ’re throwing it in the flat to the running backs			0
@entity192 has had one touchdown for 206 yards so far which is not bad			0
the receptions are pretty much spread out between @entity192 ( 12 ) , @entity186 ( 11 ) and @entity196 ( 11 )			0
so you can tell what they ’re trying to do with the passing game			0
but they need to get their running game going as well with @entity186 and there is something about him that looks a bit nervous			0
the @entity11 is the most ridiculous division ever because you have got bitter rivalries in this division			0
being a @entity212 fan , it is like @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214			0
it ’s that type of nitty - gritty division where they are all working - class towns and the football team is pivotal to the community			0
@entity192 ( centre ) has been the @entity2 ' most successful receiver so far this season @entity222 has shed the pounds in the post-season and looks more mobile than in recent seasons with the rise of the @entity228 as well , they ’ve had a great start			1
i do n’t think it ’s a surprise after they gave their quarterback @entity233 a massive boost by giving him a massive contract			0
it took the pressure off him and the team , not having to worry about having an established quarterback			0
i always like the @entity12			2
with @entity241 as head coach , even though what they ’ve gone through has been tricky for everyone involved with the franchise , i think they know how to win			0
@entity222 looks like he ’s worked really hard during the off - season			2
he ’s still a big lad but has n’t got that paunch and he looks as agile and mobile as ever			0
he is the key for the @entity2 and i do n’t think that will change for a long time			2
@entity222 has a great relationship with head coach @entity254 and they have got faith in him as a quarterback			0
if you look at his @entity260 victories , i think he thrives under pressure			0
he can really pull it out of the bag when needed and that ’s the type of player i like – one that ’s got balls			0
like @entity268 had back in the 1980s , he never gave up			0
@entity0 presents @entity27 : the @entity269 , mondays at 11pm on @entity4			0
this sunday night @entity4 will broadcast live coverage of the @entity2 versus the @entity3			1
