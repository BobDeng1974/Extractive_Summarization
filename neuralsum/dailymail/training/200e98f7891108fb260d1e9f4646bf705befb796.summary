by @entity0 on the eve of the @entity3 it was just another ordinary @entity4 street - a nondescript cul - de - sac of 60 terrace houses , home to dozens of hard - working blue - collar families			1
but by november 1918 , some 161 residents of @entity10 in @entity11 had stepped up to serve their country in the trenches of the @entity3			1
of those 29 were killed in action while a further 20 would succumb to their injuries on their return			1
such was its sacrifice that @entity20 called @entity10 the ' bravest little street in @entity22 ' for having provided so many volunteers			2
sacrifice : chapel street in @entity11 , @entity25			1
from this one @entity26 volunteered to fight in the trenches during @entity3 @entity10 today : the terraces houses were torn down in 1939 as part of a slum - clearance project , a @entity31 on the wall of an @entity34 restaurant commemorates those who volunteered and those who lost their lives today the rows of terraces are gone , torn down in 1939 as part of slum - clearance project , to give way to modern flats			1
a blue plaque attached to the side of an @entity34 restaurant is the only reminder of men who volunteered to do their duty and those who paid the ultimate price			2
many of the men of @entity10 were @entity53 immigrants who worked as labourers			1
the lack of work in the winter months was one reason why so many were quick to volunteer			0
a memorial , unveiled outside @entity59 by the @entity60 on april 5 , 1919 private @entity61 , left , who survived the war and died in 1937 aged 59 and private @entity63 , pictured with his wife @entity64 , who died in the trenches aged 41 they were ideal recruits , fit and strong from doing building work , some had experience of fighting in the @entity70 , others wanted a chance to become a hero and earn respect			0
of the 161 who served , 88 joined up immediately			0
the youngest was just 16 , the oldest 44 , meaning both would have lied about their age to sign up			0
they included @entity79 , who joined @entity80 and took part in the @entity82 in 1914 â€“ during the retreat told to hold the line to the last man			1
at the end of the battle out of 1,000 men of the 1st @entity89 , only 200 were left so had to bring men back from posts in @entity92 to replenish the ranks			0
and there were the three @entity96 brothers - @entity97 who joined up in 1914 aged 23 , @entity98 the eldest who joined up in 1915 aged 25 and the youngest @entity100 , who joined up a week later aged 22			2
@entity98 rose to the rank of @entity102 with the @entity25 regiment and lost two fingers on his left hand in 1916 while fighting on the @entity106			1
farewell : crowds gather on @entity10 in 1914 to wish the departing men good luck ' over the top ' during the @entity106 in 1916 , where @entity96 , the youngest of three brothers from @entity10 who all volunteered lost three fingers on his left hand @entity100 was a driver in the @entity114 , while @entity97 's service record has been lost			0
all three returned but @entity100 died in 1921 aged 27 , possibly as a result of being gassed			0
@entity97 struggled to find work on his return and died in 1937 aged 47 and was buried in a pauper 's grave			0
the @entity96 brothers are among those remembered at a special exhibition at the @entity124 in @entity125 , to mark the centenary of the war			1
of course the loss of so many of its young men took its toll on @entity10			0
without their breadwinners many of the families fell into poverty			2
on april 5 , 1919 , a memorial was unveiled outside @entity59 by the @entity60 to commemorate those who served and those who did not return			0
the blue plaque which was unveiled on @entity137 2001 following a campaign by the @entity139 in @entity11 some 70 survivors of the original 161 volunteers marched on parade , accompanied by a brass band , those who were unable to walk due to their war injuries rode in a specially - provided carriage			1
to mark the occasion the @entity20 sent a five page telegram to acknowledge the men of @entity10 in 1960 the @entity150 on which the @entity151 was displayed was also pulled down			0
no memorial plaque in the area until @entity137 2001 following a campaign by the @entity139 in @entity11 .			2
