the trick to managing this herculean task , he says , was team work			0
' it 's easier to do the challenge in a group because you have one person doing the photographs and one person doing the log book , ' he explains			0
' for me , the job was making sure we passed through every station , and [ deciding ] what line we were taking next			0
enthusiast : @entity8 achieved his feat in 22 hours , 26 minutes and two seconds ' we would stop , the doors would open and we would take the photograph			1
' you do n't have to physically step on the platform			0
' there are times when it has gone wrong with delays , lines being closed and broken down trains			0
' but overall we had some good luck			2
' we were up for 26 hours and if it was n't for my teammates , i probably would have fallen asleep			2
' ' there was no celebration at the end			0
it was more like " can we go to bed now ? " ' this swift dash around @entity64 's most famous city eclipsed the previous record by almost half an hour			2
in 2009 , @entity66 and @entity67 , both from @entity5 , completed the challenge in 22 hours and 52 minutes			1
odyssey : mr @entity8 's journey took him to all corners of the network - including stations in @entity74 before tackling this marker , mr @entity8 also took on a solo challenge to visit all 270 stations on the @entity78 in the quickest time possible			1
