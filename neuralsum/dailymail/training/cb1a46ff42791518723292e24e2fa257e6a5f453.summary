the @entity0 was dragging its feet on processing @entity5 bombing suspect @entity4 's @entity3 citizenship after a routine background check revealed he had been questioned by the @entity7 in 2011			1
@entity4 , 26 , filed an application for citizenship six months ago but immigration officials had not yet made a decision on his case at the time of the @entity15 bombings			2
authorities knew the alleged bomber had a domestic violence charge on his record but the fact he had been grilled by federal agents is reportedly what threw up red flags , halting the progress of his application			0
it 's not clear what the 26 - year - old , who was killed early friday , was told about why his application was facing delays			0
pending : @entity0 had n't granted @entity3 citizenship to @entity5 bombing suspect @entity4 , pictured left in 2010 , and right , last monday , minutes before the attack in custody : @entity33 , 19 , is in critical condition at a @entity5 hospital after he was discovered friday evening hiding in a boat in @entity37 @entity38 reported on friday that the @entity7 interviewed the older @entity4 brother in january 2011 at the request of the @entity42 government , which suspected that he had ties to @entity46 terrorists			1
they said this decision to delay his application proved his encounter with the @entity7 did not go unnoticed by the @entity0			2
according to the @entity52 , the terror suspect 's application , presented on september 5 , also prompted the @entity7 to do ' additional investigation ' of him this year			2
they did n't reveal how far the probe had gone or what it covered			0
@entity4 's papers were submitted just days after his brother , @entity33 , 19 , had his own citizenship application approved			1
according to the @entity52 , officials with @entity0 contacted the @entity7 late last year to learn more about its interview with the terror suspect and the agency reported its conclusion that he did not present a threat			1
however , immigration officials did not move to approve or deny the application , choosing instead to leave it open for ' additional review			0
' on sunday , @entity3 lawmakers from both parties criticized the @entity7 for failing to spot the extremist leanings of @entity4 and demanded to know why the agency did not at least follow up with the elder brother following a six - month trip to @entity42 in 2012			1
sen. @entity78 ( r - @entity79 ) went so far as to say ' the ball was dropped ' by the federal agency by either missing ' a lot of things ' during their initial investigation of the suspect or did not allow investigators to ' follow up in a sound , solid way			1
' outspoken : @entity90 sen. @entity92 , left , @entity89 - @entity90 , and sen. @entity78 , @entity91 - @entity79 , raised questions on @entity94 over the @entity7 's follow - up on the elder @entity4 brother under the barrage of attacks , the @entity7 has stood by their initial public statement issued earlier last week , which said that the agency closed their investigation on the ethnic @entity46 in 2011 after failing to find any ‘ terrorism activity , domestic or foreign			1
’ on sunday , @entity105 chairman @entity104 wrote to the @entity7 and other officials asking why @entity4 did not raise suspicions after @entity42 asked the bureau to investigate him two years ago			1
' because if he was on the radar and they let him go , he 's on the @entity42 ' radar , why was n't a flag put on him , some sort of customs flag ? , ' @entity104 , a @entity113 @entity112 , said on @entity94 's ' @entity117			2
’ ' and i 'd like to know what intelligence @entity42 has on him as well			0
' sen. @entity92 ( @entity89 - @entity90 ) was largely supportive of the @entity7 ’s efforts , but questioned why @entity4 was n’t interviewed upon his return from @entity42 , where he had been for six months in 2012			1
‘ there were things on his website that indicated that he had been radicalized , ’ @entity92 said			0
‘ i think there ’s a lot of questions that have to be answered			0
’ dwelling : the @entity4 brothers lived in this nondescript house in @entity132 , just across the river from @entity5 frequent : @entity4 was said to often visit the @entity134 of @entity5 mosque in @entity132 , pictured the @entity7 interviewed @entity4 in 2011 , shortly after @entity42 's @entity136 asked the agency to look into him as a possible @entity139 radical who might soon travel to @entity42			1
it was unclear before yesterday which foreign country had tipped off the @entity7			0
when contacted , the @entity7 referred @entity142 to the statement it issued on april 19 , saying the @entity7 ’s search into @entity4 ’s records , travel history , and internet use yielded no results			2
meanwhile , the organization has vehemently refuting a claim by the mother of the @entity4 brothers who said the bureau had spoken to @entity4 following the two bombs exploding at last monday ’s marathon			0
@entity7 spokesman @entity155 told the @entity156 sunday that the interviews in 2011 with @entity4 and family members were the agency ’s only contact with the bombing suspect			1
the @entity4 ’s parents , who live in @entity42 , less than a year after the @entity7 interview , @entity4 did in fact travel to the volatile @entity166 region of southern @entity42 on a six - month trip out of the @entity3			1
much of what @entity4 did on that trip is still a mystery to @entity3 investigators , @entity168 reported			2
neighbors contacted by @entity168 say @entity4 spent at least a few weeks in @entity166 , a predominantly @entity174 region in the @entity176 mountains where @entity139 militants have long been a thorn in the side of governments in @entity181			0

' @entity4 was not put on any no - fly list of suspected terrorists , @entity3 officials said			2
but his brush with the @entity7 did raise concerns when he applied for @entity3 citizenship last year , a source close to the bombing investigation said			1
officials of the @entity0 decided to give his application extra scrutiny because of the @entity7 interview and also due to an allegation against him of domestic abuse on a girlfriend in 2009 , the source said			2

@entity78 told @entity94 that @entity3 laws do not allow the @entity7 to follow up enough even if it does spot danger			1
@entity224 senator @entity92 of @entity90 told @entity94 ' there 's certainly a lot of questions ' about the @entity7 's handling of the case			1
one @entity3 counterterrorism official urged perspective			0
' if we thoroughly investigated every one of these terrorism tips we get , we 'd never get anything done , ' he said			0
captured : the @entity7 wanted poster released last night was updated to show that @entity217 was in custody a senior @entity3 law enforcement source said that the number of tips received from @entity42 intelligence to the @entity7 each year is ' not that many			1
' but nationally , he said , the @entity7 receives at least 100 terrorism tips a day - from the public , local and state law enforcement , other federal agencies and the intelligence community			0
@entity247 chairman @entity246 , a former @entity7 agent , defended the agency			0
the @entity249 @entity112 said the @entity7 had performed a ' very thorough ' review of the older brother in 2011 , but then it failed to receive further cooperation from @entity42			2
' that case was closed prior to his travel , so i do n't think we missed anything , ' @entity246 said on @entity259 's ' @entity258			0
' ' at some point they ( the @entity7 ) asked , is there more clarifying information , and never received that clarifying information , and at some point they have nothing			0
you ca n't ask them to do something with nothing , ' @entity246 said			0
but @entity104 and @entity191 said the handling of @entity4 's case looked like it was part of a pattern			1
open investigation : law enforcement evidence technicians continue to investigate the scene of the @entity15 bombings on saturday the 26 - year - old ' appears to be the fifth person since september 11 , 2001 , to participate in terror attacks despite being under investigation by the @entity7 , ' the pair said in a joint letter			0

in addition , @entity309 , who tried to bring down a @entity3 jetliner over @entity311 on christmas day 2009 , had been identified to the @entity313 as a potential terrorist , the letter said , adding the cases ' raise the most serious questions about the efficacy of federal counterterrorism efforts			1
' the @entity320 letter asked for all information the @entity3 government had on @entity4 before april 15			2
it was also addressed to director of national intelligence @entity324 and homeland security secretary @entity326 .			0

@entity0 had put a hold on @entity5 bombing suspect @entity4 's @entity3 citizenship application because of 2011 @entity7 interrogation
lawmakers have blasted the @entity7 's handling of @entity4 case claiming the agency should have done more
@entity42 tipped @entity7 off to potential terrorist links but he was found to be clear of ' terrorism activity '
