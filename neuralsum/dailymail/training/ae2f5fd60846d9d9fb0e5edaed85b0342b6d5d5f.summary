by @entity0 there was a time when a picture was worth a thousand words			1
with emails and texts littered with emojis , anyone could convey what they were feeling without ever having to type a single word			2
but now a new form of self - expression is sweeping social media – and it ’s all thanks to the ever - expressive animated gif			2
a @entity16 - short for graphical interchange format - is a bitmap image format that supports short animations			2
one of the front runners of the @entity16 trend is the relay messaging app , which allows anyone to search a library for @entity25 that reflect their state of mind			1
the @entity25 are placed into categories such as ' bored ' , ' hungover ' , ' grumpy ' , ' happy ' and ' excited ' and users can send their chosen mini-movie to other relay users			1
for instance , if a user wants to show their excitement , @entity32 such as a dancing @entity34 the frog appear in the search results			2
one of the front runners of the @entity16 trend is the @entity22 ( pictured ) which allows anyone to search a library for @entity25 that reflect their state of mind once just a part of the jargon of hardcore computer enthusiasts , how to properly say @entity16 has been debated since it was invented in 1987			0
most people pronounce @entity16 with a hard @entity46 but @entity45 , the inventor of the widely used web illustration , last year declared it should be pronounced ' @entity49 , ' a @entity50 dedicated to the question exists , although it comes to no solid conclusion			0
there 's also a @entity55 video on the subject			0
even the @entity58 president has taken a stand			0
when the @entity61 debuted its own @entity50 page in april , it posted a graph of what to expect on its new microblog			0
among the offerings was ‘ @entity16 ( hard “ g ” ) ’			0
as well as pre-created @entity32 , anyone can search through @entity55 videos and other web content to find exactly the correct animation that reflects their feelings			0
users can even create their own gifs by tapping the ' + ' button while in a chat room , and then pressing the camera icon			1
whether it be a winking @entity80 or a frowning baby , the @entity32 can be placed in a ‘ favourites ’ file so they can be used at the touch of a button			0
web pages are shown with a preview image and headline to reveal what the image or @entity16 about so that users do n’t have to see urls			1
if users happen to be on the app at the same time , they can see if a contact is looking at a gif and talk about what ’s being viewed			1
the free app , created by @entity100 - based relay , is available on both @entity101 and @entity103 devices			1
as well as pre-created @entity25 ( left ) , anyone can search through their own @entity55 videos and other web content to find exactly the content that reflects their feelings			0
users can even create their own gifs by tapping the ' + ' button while in a chat , and then pressing the camera icon ( right )			1

relay places @entity116 into categories such as bored , hungover and happy
users can then send their chosen mini-movie to other relay app users
anyone can create their own gifs in the app using the camera function
the @entity115 app is currently available on both @entity101 and @entity103 devices
