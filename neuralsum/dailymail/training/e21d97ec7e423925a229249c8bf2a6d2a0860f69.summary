by @entity0 published : 05:05 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 05:42 est , 25 january 2013 taken towards the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th , these shocking black and white photographs tell a tragic story			1
millions of @entity7 bison , also known as @entity7 buffalo , were reduced to mountainous piles of bleached white bones and drying hides following a slaughter on an unprecedented scale carried out by @entity15 settlers			1
at the time , of course , the perpetrators of the hunts that led to the buffalo 's near extinction held a very different point of view to that of most people today			1
decimated : @entity25 were nearly wiped out by white hunters as they moved into the @entity7 west			1
pictured , the carcasses of dead buffalo lying in the snow following a hunt macabre : a pile of bison and antlered deer skulls sit bleaching in the sun in @entity38 , @entity39 , 1870			1
skulls were often kept as trophies or for decoration by hunters slaughtered : men in the mid- 1870s pose with a mountain of buffalo skulls soon to be ground into fertilizer , the sad remains of an animal that once ruled the @entity7 plains at their peak the bison are believed to have been the biggest population of large wild mammals anywhere on @entity55 , numbering an estimated 50 million before the @entity15 settlers arrived			1
yet within the space of a few decades , their number would be reduced to a mere 2,000 , bringing to an end an era in @entity7 history			1
far from inciting feelings of disgust or horror , the slaughter of bison was seen by @entity15 settlers as a means to wealth , a healthy pastime , and most chilling of all , as a way to end the primary source of sustenance for the @entity75 and so drive them from their land			1
perhaps the most shocking fact about the near extinction of the @entity7 bison is that it appears to have been wholly intentional , part of a high - level strategy			1
many scholars believe the government and military actively promoted the slaughter of bison herds to remove the primary food source of the @entity88			1
proud : two hunters inspect their kill , around 1903			1
men on horseback like these had an easy time shooting bison , which could be slow to react to their approach wall of bones : a long pile of buffalo bones stretches into the distance while a boy poses in front - @entity102 , @entity103 , 1890 there is heated debate about the existence of an actual government policy that enforced this aim			2
without the buffalo , the @entity88 could not survive , and without the @entity110 , @entity15 settlers were free to claim their lands for themselves			1
witnesses reported seeing a sea of black during their annual migrations and feeling the ground trembling with the beat of millions of hooves			2
for the @entity75 such as the @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and others , the @entity7 buffalo played an important role not only in their culture and religion but also in their very survival			2
to them , the bison provided an endless supply of necessities , and every part of the animal served a purpose			2
the blood , milk , meat , marrow , organs , testicles , nipples and everything down to the nose gristle were eaten , and buffalo tongues and fetuses were considered particular delicacies			2
some tribes are described as being part of the ' @entity75 ' as the animals were their main source of flesh , hide and bones , and were used to make other items such as food , cups , decorations , crafting tools , knives , and clothing			1
the tribes followed the seasonal grazing and migration of buffalo			2
to many @entity88 , the bison was also a symbol of sacred life and abundance			2
skulls were often kept as trophies or for decoration			2
in 1842 , an observer of the bison migration , @entity174 , wrote : ' suddenly a cloud of dust rose over its crest , and i heard a rushing noise as of a mighty whirlwind , or the charging tramp of ten thousand horses			2
' i had not time to divine its cause , when a herd of buffalo arose over the summit , and a dense mass , thousand upon thousand , galloped , with headlong speed , directly upon the pot where i stood			0
' still onward they came			0
@entity192 protect me ! it was a fearful sight			0
' a fearful sight that was soon never to be seen again			0
how the modern bison came to dominate the @entity7 landscape is still being debated			0
there is some evidence that prior to @entity15 colonisation , herds were small and regulated by @entity202 hunters			0
it was humans , not bison , who dominated the plains landscape , some sources say			0
then the @entity15 arrived , bringing with them the disease epidemics that wiped out so many @entity88 and left so much of their vast grasslands empty and ready for bison to take over - which they did in huge numbers			0
the animals once roamed the @entity7 plains from @entity216 down to @entity217 , and as far east as the western boundary of the @entity219			1
a major contributor to the bison 's decimation was the expanding railroad system			0
not only did the industry 's leaders actively encourage the slaughter of bison , which were a nuisance on their tracks , but thanks to them , buffalo products could now be collected and distributed in larger numbers than ever before			0
as the railroads were laid down , they effectively split the herds			0
this new transportation network also made it easy for commercial hunters to reach herds further and further out in the plains			0
market hunters like these could kill hundreds of bison in a single encounter			0
in fact some , such as ' @entity243 , became famous for slaying thousands during their lifetime			1
killing : a pile of buffalo bones waiting to be loaded onto a train in @entity216			0
the expansion of the railway system across @entity7 was another factor in the decimation of the animal 's population sad : @entity257 's buffalo hide yard in @entity258 , @entity259 , 1878 , with some 40,000 buffalo hides apparently in shot hides : skins hung up to dry in 1926 , the hides were the most prized body parts of the hunted bison and quite often the only parts commercial hunters took hundreds of thousands of tons of bison bones were used in various industries , including the refining of sugar and for making bone china and fertilizer			1
the buffalo has become a key symbol in @entity7 culture , and is used in official seals , flags , and logos in both the @entity281 and in @entity216			0
there are currently around 500,000 bison in captive commercial populations on about 4,000 privately owned ranches			0
however , only 15,000 total individuals are considered wild bison in the natural range within @entity7 .			0

@entity25 population fell from 50 million to just 2,000 following hunting
*critics* claim animals were targeted in bid to starve out native americans
one hunter , ' @entity243 ' @entity298 , killed thousands of the animals alone
