by @entity0 , deputy political editor published : 19:53 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 02:57 est , 23 january 2013 ministers have ordered a shake - up of the honours system amid fury that @entity5 did not get a knighthood and @entity7 can not be stripped of his			1
no 10 is irritated that @entity8 , who won two golds at the @entity10 , did not get a knighthood , while @entity12 , who won two track golds at the @entity14 , became a @entity15			2
civil servants have told ministers that he could not get a top honour since he did not have an mbe already			2
archaic rules mean @entity7 , branded a serial paedophile by a recent police report , can not be stripped of his knighthood posthumously @entity25 rules mean sir @entity7 , branded a paedophile by a police report , can not be stripped of his gong after death			1
ministers have intervened to demand new rights to bypass the civil service after it emerged that more mandarins got gongs this year than @entity35 , with just 68 @entity37 athletes receiving honours compared to 124 civil servants and quangocrats			1
it is understood that at a @entity43 meeting before @entity44 , ministers agreed to seize control of the honours system			2
tories are amazed that the civil servant at the @entity49 who is responsible for picking those who get honours was himself granted an gong this year			1
honours secretary @entity53 was granted an mbe in the @entity54			2
a senior @entity57 source said : ' this is n't even gongs for the boys , it 's gongs for the boys who hand out the gongs			2
' a no 10 source added : ‘ of course we wanted @entity5 to get a knighthood but they get very sniffy about the rules			1
there is all this stuff about having a small one first and working your way up			0
the public would be mystified			0
’ other ministers , like @entity76 chairman @entity75 , have grown irritated with the system when civil mandarins repeatedly rejected their nominees without providing any explanation			0
' @entity75 kept putting forward officials who have helped push through important reforms but there was radio silence			0
he eventually learned that civil service bosses were selecting people who were retiring instead			1
he forced this issue and both people got gongs			0
we 're seeing a change , ' the source added			0
the shake - up has been ordered after anger that figures such as @entity5 did n't get a knighthood in this year 's honours list ministers are reported to have been angry at arcane rules which allowed @entity12 to be a @entity15 after winning two gold medals in 2004 but @entity5 was n't knighted for his achievements this summer under the plans , ministers would get the right to bypass the laborious selection process , where civil servants weed out the nominees , and send their suggestions straight to the relevant honours committee , which are now staffed by experts as well as civil servants			1
if mandarins reject the suggestions they will have to provide a full explanation in writing to the minister , dissuading them from simply rewarding their own rather than people who command public support			0
a senior government source said : ' what we 've seen in recent years is a complete civil service takeover of the honours system which have cut politicians out			1
it started as a reaction to the @entity127 years but there is now a realisation that it has gone far too far			0
' we have replaced political control of the honours system with control exercised by unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats			0
' the plans for change have been fed into sir @entity137 , the head of the civil service , is conducting ' quinquennial review ' of the system , which is due to be sent to @entity141 for approval this @entity143			1
he has accepted that ministers have the right to feedback but is resisting calls for them to bypass the civil service bureaucracy on the grounds that this would politicise the system			1
a civil service source defended the mandarins , pointing out that honours for domestic civil servants and quangocrats account for just one in 11 gongs			1
when diplomats and members of the @entity160 are thrown in , 18 per cent of honours go to public servants			0
' the vast majority are people who do charity or voluntary work , often in their local communities			0
' we reject the criticism that the government hand out gongs to people for long service			2
all honours are given to people on their own individual merits			0
there is no rubber stamping			0
' plans for change have been passed to civil service chief sir @entity137 , who is conducting a review .			1

serial paedophile keeps his knighthood while @entity5 only gets a @entity187
