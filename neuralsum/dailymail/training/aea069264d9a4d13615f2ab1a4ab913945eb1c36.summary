by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 00:14 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 00:18 est , 9 may 2013 a 63 - year - old man who only leaves his @entity4 apartment to make frequent trips to the doctor 's office is now being summoned to a prison in @entity9 because he never served his full term for killing his father as a teenager			1
the case of @entity14 is bringing a decades - old interstate turf battle back to the forefront as the governor of @entity9 has called for @entity18 to be extradited back to @entity9			1
@entity14 was convicted of first - degree murder and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison for killing his father as a teenager in 1965			1
back to his past : @entity14 was arrested in 1965 for murder but has been out of prison since 1971 because of the former governor of @entity4 's ruling in his favor when he was granted a five - day leave from prison for good behavior , he headed to @entity4 , where his mother lived			1
he 's been there ever since - thanks to the then - governor of @entity4 who , in 1971 , refused to send him back to @entity9 and its notorious prison system			1
enforcing the law : after @entity18 was discovered recently , @entity9 governor @entity37 ordered him to be sent back to the state to serve his time @entity9 governor @entity37 on wednesday defended his request to have the elderly fugitive returned in spite of his poor health			1
‘ i 'm an invalid now			0
what would their interest be to have me back ? ’ @entity14 said			0
@entity37 told @entity1 he was n't aware of @entity14 ' health issues when he sought to have him brought back to the @entity9 prison system , but that will not make him revoke his request			2
' we ca n't pick and choose which laws that we like and which laws that we do n't like , ' @entity37 told the @entity1 ' and once the @entity53 was given information about his whereabouts , and ... they requested me to sign an extradition warrant , then that 's my duty and that 's the law and that 's what we did			0
' the @entity1 recently found @entity14 living in a one - bedroom apartment along a busy road in the @entity66 suburb of @entity67 , @entity4			2
he gets by on $ 700 a month in @entity69 benefits , usually making trips outside only to see a doctor			0
his life now : @entity18 is 63 - years - old , in poor health , and lives with his companion @entity74 in a small apartment in @entity67 , @entity4			2
he is seen holding ms @entity74 ' granddaughter in this photo he needs an inhaler and 10 pills a day for his diabetes , high blood pressure and other ailments			0
a stocky man with thick arms , @entity18 grappled with sewer lines as a plumber until two strokes ended his working days and made his speech difficult to understand			0
he was astounded to learn that @entity9 has renewed its efforts to bring him back to prison - more than four decades after then - governor @entity91 blocked the state 's initial request			1
at the time , @entity91 wrote that the notorious @entity9 prison system was a form of ‘ cruel and unusual punishment ’			2
' no purpose would be served now by sending that man back , ' the former governor told the @entity1			0
now 91 - years - old , mr @entity91 said that he does not remember @entity101 's case specifically but the move to allow the young black man to stay in the midwestern state does seem fitting			2
then and now : former @entity4 governor @entity91 , seen in 1978 at left and 2008 at right , initially allowed @entity14 to stay in his state because the @entity9 prison system was notorious at the time ' knowing how distressed i was about the shameful state of race relations in our country , i would have wanted to give that man another chance , ' he said			1
@entity37 , a @entity117 , sent a letter this year to @entity119 @entity4 governor @entity119 , seeking @entity18 after his @entity69 benefits put him back on @entity9 ' radar			1
state prison officials said they did n't know that @entity14 was sick , either , but @entity53 spokeswoman @entity123 told the @entity1 that it 's not the agency 's role to make judgments about whether @entity14 should be brought back to @entity9			1
' it 's our job to carry out the mandates of the court , ' @entity127 said			0
' and that 's simply what we 're doing in our efforts to seek him			0
' @entity136 , a spokeswoman for @entity119 , said the matter was still under review and ' there 's not currently a timeframe for when that may be concluded			0

@entity14 was arrested for his father 's murder as a teen in 1965
was granted a 5 - day leave from prison for good behavior in 1971
traveled to @entity4 to visit his mother and never returned to @entity9
@entity4 governor at the time allowed him to stay because of the notorious state of the @entity9 prisons
