@entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , have endured months of delays around the town because of ongoing engineering works			1

men at rest : a cheeky resident in @entity9 , @entity10 , has defaced a road sign to show a worker sitting down with a coffee and cigarette @entity30 councillor @entity29 said : ' @entity9 has had a lot of road works taking place and there has been a lot of annoyance at how long it is taking			1
' it does n't come across as a shock that someone has done this , it is a real problem in the town with roadworks seemingly taking forever			1
' i 've seen a lot of workers sitting around and i 've raised the issue			0
' recently there was a case when workers were re-doing a road and there were terrible problems			0
lanes were closed but there was no one doing any work			0
right direction : an unexpected destination is revealed to passers - by in @entity61 other amateur artists have adapted ' stop ' signs and ' watch for ice ' signs to reference popular music satirical statement : an amusing message offers some sound advice to pedestrians in @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 ' they certainly have n't been given the appearance of being hard at work			0
' it is not the first case in which creative members of the public have had a go at adapting street signs			1
other examples include a humorous sign - writer directing drivers to a ' @entity87 ' and another advising pedestrians , ' do n't walk in front of moving traffic			0
