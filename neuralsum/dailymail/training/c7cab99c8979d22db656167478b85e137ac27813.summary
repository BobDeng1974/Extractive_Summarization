by @entity0 the unstoppable idiot has struck again			2
there is always a degree of fruitlessness when writing about @entity6 ’s ideas			1
they are always bad , always to the detriment of football , invariably self - preserving , yet for some reason irresistible			1
@entity6 , president of @entity11 , is like a monster from a horror film , marching inexorably towards his victims			1
not bullets , not fire , not all the weaponry available to mankind ; and too few in positions of influence are moved to oppose anyway			2
his latest plan , arguably his worst yet , was passed unanimously by @entity11 ’s member nations			1
the @entity24 , the @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , countries one might think could be trusted with the future of the international game , all acquiesced , meekly			1
@entity6 sees himself as the game ’s great thinker and reformer			1
he is to football what myxomatosis was to @entity66 ; what @entity26 elm disease is to @entity26 elms			2
he is the master of misrule , the creator of mismatches and instigator of tedium , the man who put the @entity70 in @entity71 and a medal around the neck of @entity74 at the @entity76 final			0
it is hard to think of a more negative influence on the sport in the last 50 years			0
he inherited competitions that were the pinnacle of football expression , and has ruined them			2
@entity6 killed the greatest international football tournament in the world when he increased participation in the @entity55 finals from 16 countries to 24			1
there are 54 member nations of @entity11 , meaning it is now almost as hard to get knocked out of the qualification process as it is to go through			1
with as many as three teams progressing from some groups once the play - offs have taken place , the qualifying stage is dull beyond comprehension			2
@entity11 took over the television rights but — as was predicted the moment the idea was floated — interest in these dead rubbers has flat - lined			1
@entity6 ( right ) has two choices			1
admit the scheme was a terrible mistake and abandon it ; or plough ahead , piling one bad idea on to another in a desperate bid to shore up interest , and add votes to his next election campaign			0
no prizes for guessing where this is heading			0
a @entity55 within a @entity55 , converting friendly football into a mini-league pooled on ability with a sequence of fixtures too complex to consider			2
all you need to know for now is the bottom line			0
the winners of each of four divisions will get a wildcard entry to the 2020 @entity55 finals			0
asking for trouble : the @entity11 president 's plans are becoming increasingly more bizarre delight : @entity140 won @entity141 and will be favourites for the competition in two years ' time in @entity28 strange move : @entity145 were among the nations to pass @entity6 's latest plans to overhaul the game no worries : the @entity24 did n't have a problem voting yes in line with other member nations as the top groups are made up of the likes of @entity140 , @entity25 , @entity145 and @entity155 , one presumes that is not such a carrot			1
the major nations will be fairly confident of qualifying via the conventional route , considering all they have to do is finish top two , or maybe three , in a six - team group			2
their friendly games will remain little more than , well , friendlies			0
for the rest , however , it is a lifeline			0
another means of remaining ordinary and inadequate and yet still getting a place at the big boys ’ table			1
each division winner will claim a place , including the bottom one			0
now guess who is going to the @entity55 finals ? based on current co-efficient rankings , one of the following : @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , the @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity46			0
( that ’s 14 votes the next time @entity6 seeks re-election , by the way			1
the man who brought the big one to @entity187			2
what ’s not to like ? ) the most recent qualification campaign , for the @entity197 , saw all of those nations in action bar @entity46			0
in total they played 128 games and recorded 13 wins , eight of which involved games against each other			0
only @entity186 ’s victory in @entity217 , @entity181 ’s in @entity212 , @entity184 ’s win at home to @entity215 , @entity183 ’s against @entity209 and @entity179 ’s victory over @entity211 were against teams that are not in that dismal last division			0
the goal difference for the 14 countries was minus 235			2
and one of them will be going to the 2020 @entity55 finals			0
to think that the tournament used to be about excellence			0
to think that what we loved about it was that there were no gentle looseners , no weak opponents and no chance to play your way in ; hit the ground running , or you were out			2
at the 2012 tournament , the @entity238 , @entity145 , @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 all lost first time out			0
only the @entity244 recovered to make it through			0
just a single defeat was also enough to eliminate @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249			0
up there with the best : @entity251 are likely to face @entity11 's top teams in the different format no problem though ? even if @entity251 were to struggle , they 'd still be able to qualify in the traditional way living in a different world ? the changes are said to offer more competitive football instead of friendlies are you laughing at me ? @entity6 's plans have been widely derided by the footballing community now 16 of 24 qualifiers will reach the final knockout stage and at least one match will involve a meeting with a team from @entity11 ’s bottom 14			1
how can @entity11 have allowed their marquee international competition to be skewed in this way ? how have the national associations supported it ? all they see is the money			1
the @entity24 would not have looked beyond those lucrative friendlies at @entity278 against @entity11 ’s giants			1
other countries do not attract significant crowds to non-competitive fixtures , and are desperate to find a means of making them interesting			1
they also buy into @entity6 ’s guff that this gives friendly football credibility			1
in 2012 , questioned on the expansion of the @entity55 from 16 to 24 teams , @entity290 , @entity11 ’s chief executive for the 2012 edition , reeled off a list of names of great teams that were unable to qualify under the old format			1
this included @entity180 , who had somehow contrived to lose to @entity187 in the qualifying campaign			2
@entity180 are currently ranked 105th in the world , which makes them pretty lousy , but also near the top of @entity11 pool four , which runs from 92nd - ranked @entity178 to @entity190 in 207th place ( @entity46 have no ranking as yet )			1
@entity180 would have a reasonable opportunity of progressing under the 24 - team format , rising to a very good chance once the wildcard entry becomes active			1
a year ago , however , when i questioned @entity6 on @entity290 ’s words he seemed unimpressed			1
‘ why @entity180 will qualify ? ’ he asked			0
i added that @entity290 counted @entity180 among the great teams who were missing out			0
‘ @entity290 do n’t know nothing about football , ’ @entity6 pouted			1
indeed not ; and he would appear to be in good company on that			0
huge boost : @entity180 , ranked 105th in the world , will see their chances of progression rocket @entity11 ’s new @entity34 starts in 2018 and will pave the way for some of the world ’s lowest - ranked sides to play at the @entity43 finals			1
how will it work ? the plan is for @entity11 ’s 54 member teams to be put into four divisions , each containing 12 - 14 teams			2
the top - ranked sides will be in @entity335 and the lowest in @entity336 each division will then be split into four pools of three or four teams			0
matches will be played between september and november 2018			0
what happens next ? the winners of the individual pools will then go into their division ’s semi-finals and then a final in june 2019			0
winners of those finals will qualify for @entity43			2
based on current world rankings , @entity251 would be in @entity335 with the likes of @entity140 , @entity25 and @entity155			0
but @entity351 , which would get one qualifying place for @entity43 , contains some of the world ’s worst teams			1
@entity46 are not a @entity356 member and so currently have no world ranking			0
what about regular qualification ? the remaining 20 places for @entity43 will be decided via the usual qualifying groups in 2019			1
if teams qualify both ways , places will go to the team below them in their @entity34 division			2
the @entity367 d teams ( world ranking in brackets ) @entity178 ( 92 ) , @entity179 ( 99 ) , @entity180 ( 105 ) , @entity181 ( 108 ) , @entity182 ( 113 ) , @entity183 ( 120 ) , @entity184 ( 122 ) , @entity185 ( 127 ) , @entity186 ( 134 ) , @entity187 ( 151 ) , @entity188 ( 162 ) , @entity189 ( 199 ) , @entity190 ( 207 ) , @entity46 ( @entity369 )			0

@entity11 president @entity6 is to implement new @entity34
the move means some of @entity11 's lowliest countries have a big chance of qualifying for @entity43
@entity6 's ideas are always to the detriment of football
@entity28 risks destroying the *brilliant* @entity43 format
