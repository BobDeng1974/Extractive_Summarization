at the @entity3 ceremony in january @entity0 and @entity1 were runners - up as @entity5 won the best coach award for guiding @entity7 to the @entity8			1
as the two men small - talked in @entity10 , @entity1 is understood to have asked @entity0 how life was in @entity12 and his answer demonstrated perfectly the dynamic between the two men			1
he said he was happy in the city and keen to stay , but that life would be a lot easier if @entity1 were not on the other side of town managing @entity12			1
having already lost the @entity20 to @entity1 at the start of the season , and the first league meeting between the two teams , since the @entity26 gala @entity0 has been knocked out of the @entity27 by his nemesis and beaten 4 - 0 in the league			1
the pressure is on @entity0 and @entity31 when @entity12 visit the @entity32 on sunday @entity0 reportedly told @entity1 that life in @entity12 would be a lot easier if @entity12 were n't around @entity1 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) were runners - up behind @entity5 at the @entity3 in january ‘ we do n’t need to beat them , we just need to go through ’ was how he approached the first leg of the @entity40 quarter - final			1
that would have been fine had real marked - up a high - scoring draw in the @entity43 but the 0 - 0 somehow scraped by @entity12 last tuesday means that now a draw will not send @entity31 through			1
@entity0 needs to beat @entity1 – or else it ’s either elimination or penalties			2
@entity0 ’s overall record against @entity1 is poor with just three wins in 12 games			1
he has been beaten twice by his team in the league this season , losing one and drawing one in the domestic competition last season			0
he did win both legs of a @entity27 tie last season but this season @entity12 got their cup revenge with an away draw and a home win to knock real out			2
@entity12 also won the @entity20 in august			0
the overall record is 12 played , three won , four drawn and five lost			0
the games are tight , usually low scoring and uncomfortably physical for @entity31 who , @entity68 and @entity69 aside , are short of players who have quite the same appetite for a battle			2
@entity0 may well pick both on wednesday night , and a third centre back in @entity76 as he looks to match the visitors for force			0
if all three are picked @entity69 would step into a midfield enforcer ’s role that he has not occupied since the days of @entity82			0
@entity31 have struggled against @entity12 in recent years and were beaten 4 - 0 in @entity83 in february the headlines from @entity86 publications as and @entity87 on wednesday focused on the huge derby game the @entity40 quarter - final first leg finished 0 - 0 after a physical game at the @entity43 there are seven players who a booking away from missing the first leg of the semi-final and @entity96 midfielder @entity94 , who is among them , has already lit the blue touch paper suggesting @entity12 ’s players are experts in pressuring the referee			1
the question of what will happen to @entity0 if he loses has already been extensively debated in @entity12			2
it would n’t necessarily be the end of him but he would certainly have to overhaul @entity108 ’s two point advantage in the league – winning nothing would be grounds for automatic dismissal regardless of the @entity40 he delivered last season			1
at times this season his team has looked like surpassing the exploits of last year ’s campaign – the run of 22 straight wins that also saw them crowned @entity122 champions in december in @entity123 was the stuff of future legend but the season collapsed in february and the bouquets for the @entity128 turned into brickbats overnight			0
@entity94 is a yellow card away from @entity132 suspension while @entity0 has several players missing the @entity128 coach watches his players , including @entity136 ( centre ) train in @entity12 on monday injuries played their part in the massive downturn			2
@entity68 and @entity69 were missing from defence and @entity142 and @entity143 from midfield			0
supporters bemoaned the fact that @entity136 , @entity147 and @entity148 should still have been able to carry the team to victories but that view did a huge disservice to the way @entity142 controls games , @entity143 loads the bullets for the front three to fire , and @entity69 and @entity68 ' pace enables the team to play ten yards higher up the pitch than when they are not available			0
just when it seemed @entity31 would be at full - strength for the run - in @entity142 has gone down with knee ligament trouble likely to rule him out for six weeks and @entity148 , @entity147 and @entity163 are also all missing on wednesday night			0
@entity0 resisted the opportunity to get his excuses in early on tuesday when he said he had the ‘ best squad in the world ’			0
he will hope that message of confidence inspires his players at the @entity32			0
and of course in among all the bad omens there is one exceptionally positive precedent : in @entity175 last may , @entity12 beat @entity12 4 - 1 and lifted the @entity40			2
if @entity0 and @entity31 were to lose on wednesday night then only @entity83 glory would be enough to save his job @entity136 struck in the @entity40 final in a rare 4 - 1 victory for @entity31 against their city rivals			1

@entity31 host @entity12 in @entity40 quarter - final second leg
first leg at @entity43 finished 0 - 0 after physical encounter
@entity0 reportedly spoke to @entity1 about life in @entity12
@entity128 boss told him life would be a lot easier if @entity12 were n't around
@entity31 must win at the @entity32 to go through , and @entity0 may not last
winning nothing at @entity31 results in an automatic dismissal
*galacticos* are currently two points *adrift* of @entity83 *leaders* @entity108
@entity0 has only won three times in 12 games against @entity1 *'s* @entity12
