by @entity0 published : 19:45 est , 16 march 2014 updated : 19:50 est , 16 march 2014 town centres face a summer of booze - fuelled violence if @entity7 ’s plans to relax drinking rules during the @entity9 go ahead , police and town halls are warning			1
the prime minister is set to approve rules allowing every single one of the country ’s 120,000 pubs and bars to open late on the evenings of @entity18 ’s matches in @entity19 this summer			1
drinking hours would be extended as late as 1am for at least the three group matches in june			1
but the proposals , published last week , have caused disquiet among police , councils and residents groups who will be left powerless to stop late opening even in pubs with a history of violence			1
police and councils are alarmed that every single one of the country ¿ s 120,000 pubs and bars will be allowed to open late on the evenings of @entity18 ¿ s matches in @entity19 this summer			1
file picture last night , council chiefs told the @entity41 the move would lead to ‘ significant disturbance ’ on the streets with local authorities left to ‘ clear up the consequences ’			1
until last month , the @entity47 was set to allow controls on extended opening to rest with town halls			2
but this was set aside after a personal intervention from the prime minister			0
mr @entity7 wants to invoke a little - used power available for ‘ significant national events ’ to allow a blanket extension of opening hours across the country			2
the power was used for the @entity58 and the @entity59 in 2012 but has never before been used for a major sporting tournament			0
@entity62 ’s intervention has caused disquiet in the @entity47 , where there are fears it could unleash a wave of street violence			2
drinking hours would be extended as late as 1am for at least @entity18 's group matches in june last night , the @entity70 , which represents councils in @entity18 and @entity72 , said the issue of which pubs can open late should be ‘ determined locally ’			1
a spokesman said : ‘ councils will always seek to say yes to well - run businesses who have proven that they can cater effectively for selling alcohol at events where emotions run high			2
‘ they also , however , have a responsibility to residents who live near popular venues and may be exposed to significant disturbance as a result			0
‘ local councils and partners such as the police are best placed to consider these issues and reach decisions on how long local premises should stay open , whereas a blanket national extension fails to take local circumstances into account at all			1
’ @entity98 documents point out that using the power during the @entity9 could lead to ‘ alcohol - related crime and disorder , public nuisance and risks to public safety			0
’ the alternative , which is backed by councils , would be for pubs and bars which wanted to stay open until late to apply for a temporary licence in the normal way			1
this would give residents their say and allow councils to keep control of late - night drinking in town and city centres			1
police point to sharp increases in violence and arrests during major football tournaments			1
in 2012 more than 152 arrests were made during the opening games of the tournament , with most on @entity18 match days			1
@entity128 , the @entity129 for @entity130 and @entity131 said : ‘ i believe these decisions should be left in local hands , where local factors can be taken into account and suitable measures put in place in liaison with experienced local advice			2
‘ this is not about stopping people having fun and enjoying the football			0
we want to make sure that we promote a safe environment into the early hours of the morning , not just for those in the pubs but for the rest of the community as well			1
’ football feast : aerial view of the @entity152 statue atop @entity154 and the @entity155 ( @entity156 ) stadium in @entity158 , @entity19 cllr @entity159 , leader of @entity160 , said : ‘ everyone will enjoy a drink during the @entity9 and big screen viewing in pubs is clearly going to be a big draw			0
‘ but that should n’t be a licence for known problem pubs that routinely give the police and councils issues to stay open simply by wrapping themselves in the @entity173 flag			1
‘ councils and the police should have the determining voice on what stays open locally as we have the local knowledge			1
‘ the era of extended licensing has in many cases proven to be more wild west saloon than the continental café society that proponents claimed			0
and , as ever , local authorities are left to clear up the consequences			2
’ alcohol campaigners suggested the @entity189 had caved to ‘ alcohol industry pressure ’			0
@entity191 , policy manager at @entity192 said : ‘ the government once again seem poised to cave into alcohol industry pressure and rather than letting local areas decide on whether to extend pub opening hours for the @entity9 , are intent on forcing this through from on high			0
‘ we think this should be up to local councils with residents who know their areas and where any potential trouble might arise			0
‘ the pressure from advertising during football @entity207 to drink alcohol can be immense but we ’d like to directly challenge the notion that watching football has to go hand in hand with drinking			0
@entity214 should be a celebration of fitness and health which is not compatible with excessive drinking			0
’ ‘ rather than act as the nation ’s landlord in setting pub hours , we ’d like the prime minister to show leadership on alcohol policy and to start by listening to the views of local residents , police , @entity229 staff rather than big business			2
’ under the original @entity47 plans councils any pub or bar could apply to their local authority for longer opening hours			2
but at the beginning of last month , mr @entity7 overruled @entity235 crime minister @entity235 and said he had ‘ ordered a re-think ’			0
it followed lobbying by the @entity238 which argued for longer opening hours across the board			0
if the pm ’s proposal is implemented it will mean all pubs can remain open until 1am for all three group games , against @entity244 at 11pm on june 14 , @entity245 at 8pm on june 19 and @entity246 at 5pm on june 24 - and any knockout stage matches			1
all knock - out stage games kick - off at 9pm apart from the final , which will be played at 8pm on july 13 in @entity158			0
mr @entity7 ’s intervention was welcomed by the @entity238			0
its chief executive @entity252 said at the time it would be ‘ fantastic news ’ for millions of football fans			0
at the time the prime minister ’s spokesman said : ‘ it is right that we consult but , subject to that consultation , clearly our intention would be that pubs would be able to be open for the relevant games , reflecting the fact that it is a major national event			2

drinking hours will be extended to as late as 1am for @entity18 matches
but even pubs known for violence will be allowed to stay open late
police and councils say they will be left with ' consequences '
