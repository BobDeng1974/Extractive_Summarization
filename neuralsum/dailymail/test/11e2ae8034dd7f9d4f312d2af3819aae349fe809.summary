trillions of pounds worth of oil – as much as the entire @entity4 fields – lies beneath an area of @entity6 dubbed ‘ @entity8 ’s @entity7 ’ , it was claimed yesterday			1
analysis suggests there is up to 100billion barrels of the fossil fuel under the @entity13			1
the potential goldmine in the @entity15 , across @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , could meet up to a third of @entity8 ’s oil demand within 15 years , according to the consortium exploring the area			1
but industry experts remained sceptical of the claims , with one describing them as ‘ overly optimistic ’			2
since 1975 , of an estimated 100billion barrels of oil in the @entity8 @entity4 , only 45billion have been pumped out			1
it is believed another 20billion barrels can be recovered before extraction becomes too difficult			2
experts warned last night that only a fraction of the @entity15 oil may be accessible for extraction			1
they also claimed fracking could be required to retrieve significant volumes			0
@entity55 , the chief executive of @entity56 , said the site at @entity29 was ' world class ' and had the potential for ' significant daily oil production ' at this proposed drilling site @entity63 consortium made the discovery during test drilling in a well five miles from @entity27			2
@entity8 @entity66 , which has a 30 per cent stake , said ‘ cutting - edge ’ data suggested the oilfield holds 158million barrels per square mile – equating to 100billion barrels across the basin			1
at current crude prices , this could be worth £ 3.7trillion			1
@entity55 of @entity56 , which insisted it would not use fracking , said : ‘ by 2030 , we could produce 10 per cent to 30 per cent of the @entity8 ’s oil demand from within the @entity81 area			1
’ @entity82 , of fellow consortium firm @entity83 , said it was of ‘ major economic significance ’			0
if flow tests showed oil could be extracted , the production process could begin within 18 months , he added			2
@entity90 firm @entity89 , which conducted the tests , estimated 3 per cent to 15 per cent of the oilfield could be extracted – up to 15billion barrels			1
@entity56 chairman @entity94 said drilling in the @entity81 could create ‘ many thousands ’ of jobs			0
although the exploration site covered 55 square miles out of 1,100 , he said the consortium was confident the entire region was oil - rich			2
works : the well is situated in this container on the proposed drilling site exploration : experts are now trying to work out how much of the oil will be properly recoverable mr @entity94 dismissed suggestions it would be hard to extract from the site , saying the ground was limestone which acted ‘ like a big sponge ’ and that ‘ you can effectively suck the oil out ’			2
the @entity117 entrepreneur , who lives in @entity118 , is a director of 16 @entity8 companies – and has been criticised in the past for exaggerating the success of his enterprises to jack up share prices			2
@entity56 shares soared after the firm claimed to have discovered a ‘ world - class potential resource ’			0
however , professor @entity127 , of @entity128 , said the claims were ‘ overly optimistic ’			0
a study by the university suggested a maximum of 40billion barrels in the region , while the @entity135 estimated the basin held just 4.4billion barrels of shale oil			1
discovery : the @entity29 site near @entity27 in @entity17 , where a large amount of oil has apparently been found drilling : exploratory wells have found that the ground contains 158million barrels per square mile development : the site is owned by a number of companies including @entity152 the professor added : ‘ the question will be how much of it we can actually get out and whether it is commercially and technologically viable to do so			1
’ @entity158 , of oil consultants @entity157 , suggested residents might object to rows of onshore oil wells , adding : ‘ the question is can it produce oil ? it is extremely difficult with a very low recovery rate			0
this is potentially interesting but i would n’t attribute any value yet			0
’ but mr @entity94 said : ‘ to all those people who say i am hiking up the share price , i am not			0
i am just saying what the @entity89 report says … i feel passionate that this is globally significant for @entity8			2
’ a @entity174 spokesman said : ‘ the government welcomes any new information which expands our understanding of the potential of the @entity15			0
’ there might be 100billion barrels of oil beneath the @entity13 – but residents living above it may not receive a penny of the profits			1
the government owns the land under your house – meaning homeowners have no right to any oil found beneath them			0
once oil has been found , oil companies pay the government for an annual licence which gives them the right to excavate the oil and keep the profits			0
the government also gains money from the tax it receives on the oil extracted			1
the only way an oil company would pay the surface landowner is if it wanted to base its drilling site on their land			0
however , firms that undertake fracking , which is seen as a more intrusive and controversial method of extracting oil than simply drilling , must sometimes agree to provide ‘ community benefits ’			0
this could include building a playground or school nearby the fracking site , and is seen as compensation for residents			0
oil companies need to consult communities if they plan to undertake fracking in their area , as well as gaining planning permission from the local council			0
oil rush : the @entity15 , of which @entity29 is part , could contain a total of 100billion barrels mystery : it is not yet known how much of the area 's oil will be easily recoverable boom : the @entity17 countryside could soon be dotted with oil wells ( file photo )			1

@entity15 estimated to contain 100billion barrels of oil , new report says
@entity8 @entity25 claims the site could supply 30 *%* of @entity8 's needs
if the maximum amount of oil is extracted it will be worth £ *600billion*
but some experts warn the site in @entity17 will be difficult to exploit
