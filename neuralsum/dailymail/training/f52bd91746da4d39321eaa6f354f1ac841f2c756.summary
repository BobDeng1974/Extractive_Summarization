by @entity1 medical correspondent diabetes : thousands could have the condition without knowing it hundreds of thousands of people are living with diabetes without realising it , an online test has revealed			2
an estimated 630,000 have an undiagnosed type 2 form of the disease , which is linked to obesity , lack of exercise and poor diet , according to @entity18			1
one in 16 people who were interviewed after taking the charity ’s online risk assessment said they were later diagnosed with the condition			1
the test asks participants for details such as their age , ethnicity and weight and then calculates the person ’s risk of type 2			1
those identified as being at high risk are advised to see their gp			1
diabetes @entity35 said the online risk assessment had been taken by more than 400,000 people , and 1,000 were questioned for the follow - up research			1
@entity40 , chief executive of the charity , said : ‘ if left unchecked , type 2 diabetes can lead to devastating health complications such as amputation , blindness and stroke			1
it is so important that people with type 2 are diagnosed as quickly as possible so that they can start getting the education and healthcare they need to manage it			1
’ around 3.8million @entity35 have diabetes – type 1 and type 2 – but this is expected to rise to 5million within ten years			2
earlier this month it was revealed that one in seven hospital patients has the disease			2
it currently costs the @entity60 £ 10billion but this figure is expected to soar to £ 17billion by 2025			0
mrs @entity40 added : ‘ at the moment , too many people with the condition are not being identified quickly enough and this is why half of people with type 2 already have signs of complications by the time they are diagnosed			1
‘ but the fact that a significant number of people taking our online @entity73 have undiagnosed type 2 suggests we are reaching the right people with it and those people diagnosed as a result are in a position to start getting the support to give them the best possible chance of a long and healthy life			1
’ despite the prevalence of diabetes , campaigners say many hospital staff do not know how to properly administer insulin – one of the main treatments			2
figures from the @entity94 show that 40 per cent of diabetes patients have experienced medication errors			0
@entity97 , of @entity18 , said one of the most common mistakes was giving insulin without food , causing blood sugar levels to fall dangerously low			1
‘ hospitals are particularly bad at managing diabetes , ’ he said			0
‘ there is a large number of medication errors			0
patients are often given insulin without giving them food at the same time causing them to have a hypo – low blood sugar			0
‘ staff do n’t properly monitor them so we are aware of people developing foot ulcers whilst in hospital			0
they are n’t really tuned into their particular needs so we see really stupid things			0
’ more than 90 per cent of patients with diabetes have type 2 , which is linked to obesity , old age and a family history of the condition			0
it occurs when the body loses its ability to process blood sugar , leading to high levels that can damage organs and nerve endings and cause blindness by harming the retinas			2
patients are encouraged to eat healthily and exercise to keep blood sugar low			0
if this fails they are offered drugs such as insulin			0

risk assessment on the internet was devised by the charity @entity18
those told they are at high risk are advised to make a @entity150 *appointment*
campaigners : more should take it to be diagnosed as quickly as possible
