he ate and then told the server he had to use the bathroom , left the bag and never returned to pay			0
the owner of the bag was identified and the bag was returned to him , mr @entity36 said			0

you have the @entity51 , the gate agents , and the flight crew and a child comes through without even a seat assignment ' @entity70 , air travel expert ' you have the @entity51 , the gate agents , and the flight crew and a child comes through without even a seat assignment			1
' mr @entity83 said that security introduced after 9/11 obviously still has major flaws			0

destination : @entity102 , with the ' @entity103 ' in the background			0
the nine - year - old flew here from @entity6 without a ticket in an apparently well - thought out plan that has similarities to the @entity111 - directed movie , at one point the boy is believed to have blended in with another family traveling through the airport to evade detection			1
' fortunately , the flight crew took appropriate actions to ensure the child 's safety , so the story does have a good ending ' @entity36 , @entity24 the boy 's parents told @entity125 they ' had nâ€™t seen much of him today ' when officers arrived at the missing child 's residence on thursday after he was reported having run away , according to @entity129			1

' ' he was able to get onto an airline where he did n't have a ticket and made it five states across the @entity174 , ' mr @entity166 said			0
' if it had n't been for alert airline employees on our end , he probably never would have been discovered			0
