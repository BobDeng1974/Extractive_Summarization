married to both @entity8 and @entity9 , model @entity6 was one of the most envied women in the world			1
yesterday at the age of 71 , she wed for a third time – with a soundtrack provided by her @entity16 terrier @entity17 who did his best to upstage the bride and her new groom , property developer @entity20			1
but that ’s where any similarity with @entity6 ’s famous past began and ended			2
there were still splashes of style , of course , from the @entity48 that took the happy couple to their wedding breakfast at the uber - trendy @entity52 in @entity53 to the presence of @entity6 ’s fellow @entity56 model @entity55			1
but there were no groupies or hangers - on as there had been when she married @entity9 in 1979 or @entity8 in 1966 – just a handful of close friends and family who threw confetti as @entity6 and @entity20 , who have been together almost 25 years , emerged from the cream - painted @entity67 arm in arm			1
and in a nod to the tradition of the bride wearing something borrowed , @entity71 wore a hat owned by her late friend @entity77 , the model turned best - selling author who died of cancer in 2009			2
friends of the couple , who live in @entity83 , feared they would never tie the knot			0

it was by no means the only famous song composed for the bewitching beauty			0
the 70 - year - old model , photographer and author , has found love for the third time with @entity20 @entity6 showcased her age - defying good looks and sartorial prowess in a chic silver and blue coat jacket and silver dress she accessorised her look with silver sandals and an oversized hat , and carried a posy of flowers as her guests showered her and her new husband with confetti @entity9 , who pursued her passionately , rhapsodised about her refusal to abandon @entity8 for him with his anguished and electrifying hit @entity130			1
he also wrote his most famous ballad , @entity131 , for her			0
in her 2007 memoir , @entity132 , @entity6 broke 35 years of silence to describe how after years of mutual anguish which pushed @entity9 to the brink of a drug - induced breakdown , she eventually left @entity8 to marry @entity9			1
her affair with the guitarist started in 1970 after he played @entity130 to her for the first time			0

‘ but with the realisation that i had inspired such passion and creativity , the song got the better of me			0
i could resist no longer			0
’ later that day , @entity9 confronted @entity8 and said : ‘ i have to tell you , man , that i ’m in love with your wife			2
’ they finally got together in 1974 , marrying five years later			0
but while the songs have gone into rock history the marriage did not last and they split up in 1984			0
