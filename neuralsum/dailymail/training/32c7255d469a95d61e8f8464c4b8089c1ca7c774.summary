the truth is the common factor in your relationships is you and therefore your life experience now puts you in a much better place to choose your perfect match resulting in long lasting love			2
' by the time you reach 40 , unlike young love you have understood the concept that your happiness is not the responsibility of another person			2
' this results in better choices			0
by taking personal responsibility in life you can put in place the steps that will move you forward to attracting , not only the right partner , but one that complements you			2
' celebrities over 40 already have their career path planned , so their focus can now turn to relationships			0
' there is a whole society of individuals that do not gain significance from relationships but from their career instead and as such attracting lasting love has not been their first priority			2
' your brain provides you that which you focus on with intense emotion and as such if that focus is not pointed towards your love life then it takes a back seat			1
' the good news is that science is actually on your side			0
as we get older it is suggested that gender differences often displayed earlier in life mellow			2
this is because brain biochemistry is rebalancing the sex hormones that affect our behaviour			0
' there is also research to suggest that passion increases with age , so a change of perception and a shift of focus towards bringing out your passionate side will allow you to nurture love once it comes along to an even stronger level than perhaps you would have had embarking on the same relationship earlier on in life			2
' the key to finding love is to take action towards meeting people , to learn lessons from past experiences and to use your knowledge to give the best to your partner and to yourself			0
