by @entity0 published : 03:39 est , 8 june 2012 updated : 06:33 est , 8 june 2012 the @entity1 has been blasted for employing more accountants than @entity4 officers			2
the number of beancounters at defence head quarters has risen to 858 - up almost three per cent in two years – at a time when thousands of frontline servicemen are facing the axe and swinging cuts			1
new figures , revealed in a response to a parliamentary question , also show the @entity1 has more accountants than all other government departments combined			1
facing cuts : the @entity4 is in the midst of huge cutbacks to plug a defence budge black hole of around £ 42billion their army of associate chartered accountant qualified number - crunchers dwarfs the 80 working at the @entity25 department and eclipses the 381 at the @entity26 , which processes welfare payments			1
a further 153 employees were in the middle of their accountancy training			0
the embattled @entity1 , which is midst of one of the toughest cost - cutting drives in its history , is having to axe 22,000 troops , fleets of warships , ships and armoured vehicles to fill a £ 42billion black hole in its budget			1
on the rise : the number of qualified accountants working at the @entity1 has risen over the past two years to 858 - while servicemen are facing cuts yet despite the huge arsenal of accounting expertise , the @entity1 has still been hit by a series of damaging blunders and accusations of waste and profligacy			1
@entity55 , @entity56 , said : ‘ people expect their hard - earned cash to be spent at the @entity1 defending the realm and properly equipping our troops , not creating jobs for hundreds of beancounters			2
‘ over the years the size of the civil service has swelled to a point where it is now seriously bloated			0
‘ quite how this legion of accountants can be justified is a mystery , especially when you consider that all the other government departments manage with so many fewer			0
‘ of course those in uniform need support staff , but this number of accountants is astounding			0
’ under the @entity78 ( @entity78 ) , unveiled in 2010 , the @entity77 must make huge cuts in order to plug a massive shortfall in funding			0
ministers said there was ‘ no choice ’ but to take ‘ difficult decisions ’ to tackle a ‘ vast black hole ’ in the @entity1 budget			1
but a withering commons report earlier this year found the cost of @entity92 ’s biggest military programmes has soared by £ 500million in a year because ‘ wasteful ’ defence chiefs failed to ‘ live within their means ’			2
under fire : the @entity1 has been hit by a series of damaging revelations over waste and profligacy which costs taxpayers billions of pounds the @entity102 said 15 crucial procurement projects for new equipment , including ‘ hunter - killer ’ submarines , fighter jets , aircraft carriers and transport planes , are £ 6.1billion - or 11.4 per cent - over budget			1
defence chiefs wasted £ 258million during a series of u-turns to make sure the replacement for the scrapped harrier jump jets could fly from the @entity117 ’s £ 6.2billion warships			1
and last year it was revealed , cash - strapped @entity1 forked out nearly £ 600million of taxpayers ’ money intended for equipment on hiring consultants , according to an internal audit			1
the audit accused the @entity1 of having budget controls that are ‘ poorly developed or non-existent ’			0
an @entity1 spokesperson said : ‘ there are currently 632 qualified military and civilian accountants in posts across defence out of over a quarter of a million military and civilian staff overall			2

‘ the @entity1 has increased financial discipline to get the annual budget of around £ 35bn back on track			0
