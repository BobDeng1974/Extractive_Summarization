@entity0 was the police officer in charge of the crime scene in 1965 when a dead baby was found packed and posted to @entity4 in the mail almost 50 years ago retired policeman @entity0 stood in a @entity4 post office , investigating the shocking case of a dead newborn baby who had been posted in the mail			1
the case was never solved , but it always stayed in the back of mr @entity0 's mind			1
last friday , the 73 - year - old who now lives in @entity14 returned to @entity4 for a rugby league reunion , and his partner @entity16 booked him into a hotel on @entity18 in the city centre			1
it was at the exact same address of the old post office , built on top of the crime scene of one of @entity4 's most notorious cold cases			1
the scene unfolded on may 3 in 1965 , when postal worker @entity28 noticed a foul smell coming from a package that had been sent from ' @entity31 ' in @entity32 , @entity33			1
he opened the uncollected package , sent to ' @entity35 ' , and was horrified to find a dead baby boy that still had part of his umbilical cord attached			1
for mr @entity0 , returning to the same spot so many years later brought all his old frustrations back			2
' i 've witnessed hundreds of post mortems over the years , ' he told @entity44			2
' but for some reason that one stuck with me because it was so bizarre			0
' i guess it shocked us and something like that i think is unparalleled in @entity51			0
' he has decided to speak out for only the second time since 1965 to reveal a new detail about the case , in the hope it will inspire someone to come forward with information that will solve it			1
the dead baby made headlines when it was discovered in 1965 @entity65 and @entity4 police worked together to try and solve the mystery clippings from museum archives show the inquiry into the babies death in the 1960 's mr @entity0 said the baby boy was found with a stocking wrapped tightly around his neck , ruling out the possibility that he was stillborn			1
' it was as tight as you could get it , it took a long time to get it off , ' mr @entity0 said			0
' for that child to have been murdered it must have taken a breath			0
' there was no reason to put that stocking around the child 's neck if it was stillborn			1
' mr @entity0 also still has photos of the badly decomposed body , but he says they are too gruesome to make public			0
he remembers the day he got the call to attend an incident at the post office just 200m away from the police station in central @entity4			1
' you just take your camera and walk down , you have no idea what you 're going to find , ' he said			1
' when i got there the post office staff had already opened it up but not fully up , it was only partly opened			2
mr @entity0 pictured ( left ) in 1962 when he first started working for the @entity4 police and ( right ) in 2013 ' the first thing we did was put it in a plastic bag and send it straight to the morgue			1
' a couple of days later the post mortem was carried out , and mr @entity0 watched on but he suspected the doctor performing it was inexperienced			0
' i got a feeling that the doctor had not done many post mortems , ' he said			0
' that 's not decrying what the gentleman did , he did his best			0
' it 's probably a fair comment to say the doctor was very distressed - he was not a young man and my bet was he had kids as well			2
' the case was eventually passed onto @entity33 police , because the crime was committed there and not in @entity4			1
mr @entity0 said many people had come up with theories over the years , but he thinks it was most likely a crime committed by a mother with post-natal depression			2
inside the @entity136 on @entity18 , which is built on top of the crime scene of one of @entity4 's most notorious cold cases he remained a superintendent in @entity4 until 1995 when he retired , and spent some years as an advisor to the rural @entity144 police before eventually settling in @entity145 in @entity14			1
mr @entity0 said times had changed since he was a police officer and he was aware that the public now is able to play a more active role in solving crime			2
' at one stage policing was a closed shop and you did n't tell anyone anything , ' he said			0
' but with social media out there and all sorts of things you never know , it might jog someone 's memory			0
' you might have someone make a confession on their death bed â€“ it 's not likely but it can happen			0
' mr @entity0 is cautiously optimistic the case might get solved after all these years			2
' you 've got to remain positive with these things , you ca n't just say nothing will ever happen , ' he said			0
' i guess it 's probably the copper in me but you really do like to see something happen			0
' it 's a matter of personal satisfaction			0
