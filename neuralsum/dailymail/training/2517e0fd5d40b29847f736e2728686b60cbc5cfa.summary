@entity0 has today finally released its maps app for the @entity2 , a move certain to be welcomed by users frustrated with the widely criticised mistakes in @entity7 's own version			1
the @entity2 's default maps app was previously powered by @entity0 until @entity7 took over with its own software in early september and blocked users from using @entity0 's app. but the gadget maker was bombarded with complaints for its app 's errors and forced into a humiliating apology to customers that led to the sacking of the man in charge of its development			1
the app was even blasted by @entity26 police as ' potentially life threatening ' after it sent users off course in the outback			0
it will be available for the @entity2 and @entity49 ( @entity48 ) @entity47 and higher , and will work in more than 40 countries and 29 languages			2
@entity52 , director of @entity34 for @entity53 , wrote on the company 's official blog : ' the app shows more map on screen and turns mobile mapping into one intuitive experience			2
the overwhelming feeling on opening @entity34 for the first time is relief - it suddenly feels as if a part of your @entity2 has been given back			0
gone is the nagging doubt and foreboding that , for the navigationally challenged like myself , things would not end well every time you typed a place into @entity7 's maps app. instead , @entity0 's superb service is back - and better than ever			1
the app has been completely redesigned , and is slicker and more straightforward than before			0
there are some massive improvements , notably around directions , which are fast and simple to use - and unlike @entity7 's version , include public transport			1
there 's also access to @entity84 , which give @entity0 a massive advantage			2
in some areas , @entity7 does have the edge - its 3d maps , for example , are stunning , and the maps themselves look cleaner and sharper			2
however , in terms of day to day use , there is absolutely no question that @entity0 wins , and by a huge margin , simply for having a vastly more developed database of places , and fewer of the embarrassing errors that have plagued @entity7 's service			1
@entity7 maps ca n't ( quite ) be written off , and it has improved dramatically since its launch - and will no doubt continue to do so			2
in a few years , it may become a true competitor to @entity0 's product			1
but for the foreseeable , it 's good to have @entity0 ( and my virtual sense of direction ) back			2
' it is designed from the ground up to combine the comprehensiveness and accuracy of @entity34 with an interface that makes finding what you 're looking for faster and easier			0
' lost : in one particularly bad error , @entity26 police warned @entity117 could kill after it directed users looking for a city to this barren stretch of outback on monday police in @entity26 warned drivers with @entity124 not to navigate with @entity117 after users looking for one city found themselves in barren outback more than 40 miles away			0
motorists following the much - criticised mapping service to the city of @entity131 in the country 's south - east ended up in the middle of the nearby @entity135			0
with no nearby water supplies and temperatures in the park reaching as high as @entity140 , police warned the mapping error had the potential to be ' life - threatening '			0
@entity7 launched the maps service in september after dumping @entity0 's maps in the latest version of its @entity2 and @entity147 software			1
instead , it decided to create its own , using partners such as @entity149 for data , while also using helicopters and planes to create @entity43 maps of major cities			0
however , when the app was released , users discovered thousands of flaws			0
this led to outrage among users who flooded @entity161 and @entity162 with examples of @entity7 's flawed maps			1
@entity7 ’s shares may plunge another 20 per cent as the company slides towards a ‘ @entity168 ’ , analysts have claimed			0
investors in the tech giant - the most valuable company in the world - have been ‘ panic selling ’ and brought the price down from its high of $ 705 a share in september to its current price of $ 547			0
now there are fears that it could slump to $ 420 or lower amid fears @entity7 has run out of ideas			0
analysts said that the company must avoid what is known as a ‘ @entity168 ’ where both long and short term prospects look grim			0
that will happen when a stock ’s 50 day moving average goes below its 200 day moving average - a very real possibility with @entity7			0
the @entity192 - based company has been rocked in recent weeks by reports revealing the strength of the competition from @entity0 and @entity196			0
errors noticed by users and tech reviewers included major towns such as @entity208 appearing to be missing , searches for @entity198 bringing up @entity199 - a football club for the over-fives , and large parts of the world obscured by cloud in satellite views			0
the product 's shoddiness prompted @entity7 ceo @entity213 to replace @entity214 , the executive in charge of @entity7 's mobile operating system , and @entity218 , the executive who had overseen the mapping team			1
he was even forced into issuing and humiliating apology and recommending that @entity2 owners consider using google maps through a mobile web browser or seek other alternatives until his company could fix the problems			2
@entity0 engineers started working on their new maps app before @entity7 's september 19 decision to evict them from @entity231 , @entity0 's mr @entity52 said , though he declined to be more specific			1
the additional tools in @entity0 's free @entity2 mapping app include turn - by - turn directions			1
these have long been included on @entity237 versions of the software and @entity0 's previous refusal to include it on the @entity2 is believed to be one of the reasons @entity7 decided to develop its own technology			1
the friction that has developed between @entity0 and @entity7 as they jostle for leadership in the increasingly important smartphone market also played a role in the mapping switch			2
@entity0 's new @entity2 mapping app also will offer its street - level photography of local neighbourhoods for the first time on @entity7 's mobile operating system , as well as three - dimensional views , public transit directions and listings for more than 80million businesses			1
the @entity2 app still lacks some of the mapping features available on @entity237 - powered phones , such as directions in malls and other buildings			2
a difficult road ahead : @entity7 's maps were slammed for their poor location information and distorted images , forcing the company into issuing an apology and fire two executives deemed responsible for the mess up there still is n't a @entity0 mapping app for @entity7 's top - selling tablet computer , the @entity147 , but the company plans to make one eventually			1
in the meantime , @entity147 users can access see the maps in an @entity2 mode			0
@entity0 's free mapping solution is likely to become one of the hottest commodities in @entity7 's app store , if for no other reason because of pent - up demand among @entity2 owners fed up with @entity7 's alternative			1
some @entity2 owners even refused to upgrade to @entity7 's newest software , @entity231 6 , because they did n't want to lose access to the old @entity0 mapping application built into @entity293 and earlier versions .			1

@entity7 evicted @entity0 from its latest *generation* of of devices in september
but its own version of the app proved *glitchy* and was roundly criticised
@entity7 's ceo forced into humiliating apology to customers over errors
executives in charge of the app and @entity47 both sacked over *fiasco*
@entity0 's new app has more features to bring it in line with @entity237 version
