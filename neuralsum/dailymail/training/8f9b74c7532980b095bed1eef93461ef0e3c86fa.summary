if eating bacteria - laden meat does n’t sound appetising , then how about eating meat wrapped in a bug - killing film ? that ’s the idea behind a bizarre material developed by @entity7 researchers that could help prevent meat from spoiling			1
as well as killing harmful bacteria , the film is edible and the researchers hope the product will some day be used in a similar way to a sausage casing			1
a bizarre material developed by @entity7 researchers could help prevent meat from spoiling by using essential oils and nanoparticles			1
scientists at @entity20 hope the edible material will some day be used to wrap meat products , in a similar way to a sausage casing so far , four different versions of the material have been developed by a team at @entity20 , led by professor @entity28			1
the antibacterial ingredients in the materials are made up of either rosemary oil , oregano essential oil , zinc oxide or silver nanoparticles			2
those ingredients are combined within a layer of pullulan , which is a tasteless edible plastic created by the @entity38 pulluns fungus			1
@entity40 is used as a film in breath freshening tabs that disintegrate on the tongue and capsules that disintegrate in the stomach			0
the antibacterial ingredients in the materials are made up of a mixture of rosemary or oregano essential oils , or zinc oxide or silver nanoparticles			2
those ingredients are combined within a layer of @entity40 , which is a tasteless edible polymer created by the @entity38 pulluns fungus ( pictured ) everyone 's done it - dropped food on the floor but still eaten it because of the so - called ‘ five second ’ rule			1
a team of microbiologists has now put this theory to the test to prove once and for all whether this rule does apply			0
the research was carried out by final year @entity69 students from @entity70			0
the food included toast , pasta , biscuits and sticky sweets and they were timed from three to 30 seconds			0
the findings confirmed that time is significant in the transfer of bacteria , but the type of flooring is the deciding factor			0
carpeted surfaces were least likely to transfer bacteria , over any period of time - and this was the case for all four food types			0
across the board , toast was the food least likely to pick up bacteria from any of the flooring types but only if it was dry			0
toast with butter or jam increased the likelihood of picking up germs			0
moist foods , including pasta and sweets could be picked up within the five - second window and not pick up bacteria – but after five seconds , the risk of infection jumped			0
once meat is wrapped in the film , the pullulan sticks to its surface , gradually dissolving and slowly releasing its anti-bacterial cocktail into the meat			1
during the study , meat products were first injected with bacterial pathogens , then vacuum - packed in the film and stored in a fridge for up to three weeks			1
when they were analysed , the four different types of edible film were found to be fresher than samples that had been packed in conventional polyethylene film			2
‘ the results from this study demonstrated that edible films made from pullulan and incorporated with essential oils or nanoparticles have the potential to improve the safety of refrigerated , fresh or further - processed meat and poultry products , ’ said professor @entity28			1
‘ the research shows that we can apply these food - grade films and have them do double duty -- releasing antimicrobials and imparting characteristics to protect and improve food we eat			2
’ the safety of eating such a film , however , is still under question			2
the researchers claim that regulators still require evidence that nanoparticles are not harmful to the human body when eaten			2
‘ the meat industry likes the properties of the polyethylene vacuum packaging materials that they are using now , ’ she said			0
knowing that edible films can release antimicrobials slowly over time and keep bacteria in meat at bay , further research will be aimed at creating what @entity28 referred to as ‘ active packaging ’ - polyethylene film with antimicrobial properties			1
‘ right now , we have two different packaging materials that are not necessarily compatible , leading to a two - step process , ’ said professor @entity28			0
‘ i keep thinking there 's a way to extrude edible , antimicrobial film in one layer with polyethylene , creating all - in - one packaging			1
‘ the chemistry of binding the two together is the challenge , but we need to find a way to do it because marrying the two materials together in packaging would make foods - especially meat and poultry - safer to eat			0

anti-bacterial ingredients are combined in layer of tasteless edible plastic

scientists at @entity20 hope the edible material will some day be used to wrap meat products , in a similar way to a sausage casing
there *remain* safety concerns over whether nanoparticles can be ingested
