the condition caused him to put on weight and suffer seizures @entity5 was suffering severe headaches before his gp referred him to @entity8 where doctors discovered a tumour the size of a golf ball in his brain doctors believe the tumour caused the teenager 's body to begin producing excess growth hormone as a result he has grown eight inches , shooting up from 5ft 6ins to 6ft 2ins in the last year			1
this has caused @entity5 to suffer seizures and gain weight			0
doctors are unsure whether the teenager will stop growing , despite 12 tablets and an injection to control his gigantism every day			1
his mother @entity28 , 54 , said @entity5 is now unable to go to college or meet up with his friends for fear of suffering a seizure			2
she said : ' he suffered with headaches really badly so we knew there was something not right			0
' the next thing we were told he had a tumour in his brain the size of a golf ball - it was a devastating thing to hear			2

he had the operation just before @entity71 but then we noticed over the next few months that his body was changing dramatically			0
' he shot up in height and he put on loads of weight - none of his clothes would fit him so i had to buy him a whole new wardrobe			0

it results in the growth of body tissues over time			0

acromegaly is often caused by a benign ( non-cancerous ) brain tumour , called an adenoma			2
