he has joined a boycott organised to protest @entity3 's treatment of the @entity8 after a number of @entity8 academics contacted him			2
@entity19 , media director at the @entity21 spokesman , initially said @entity0 's decision was based strictly on health concerns			1
however , it has now been revealed that the withdrawal is politically - motivated			2
a letter sent to event organisers said : ' i accepted the invitation to the @entity11 with the intention that this would not only allow me to express my opinion on the prospects for a peace settlement but also because it would allow me to lecture on the @entity34			1
' however , i have received a number of emails from @entity8 academics			0
they are unanimous that i should respect the boycott			0
in view of this , i must withdraw from the conference			0
' had i attended , i would have stated my opinion that the policy of the present @entity3 government is likely to lead to disaster			0
' mr @entity19 's initial statement said : ' for health reasons , his doctors said he should not be flying at the moment so he 's decided not to attend			1
' ' the decision is for health reasons			2
he is 71 years old			2
he 's fine , but he has to be sensible about what he can do			0
' a @entity21 statement released after the letter , published in @entity56 were revealed , read : ' we have now received confirmation from professor @entity0 's office that a letter was sent on friday to the @entity3 president 's office regarding his decision not to attend the @entity11 , based on advice from @entity8 academics that he should respect the boycott			1
' @entity0 suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , also known as @entity70 's disease			2

conference chairman @entity73 said @entity0 's decision was ' unjustifiable and wrong			1
' tension : a @entity8 protester holds the @entity78 national flag during clashes of the weekly protest against the @entity82 settlement of @entity83 , at @entity85 village near @entity86 , @entity34 last month blast : @entity8 militants of the @entity89 ( @entity89 ) inspect a training base after it was hit by an @entity3 air strike in @entity92 , southern @entity93 ' the academic boycott against @entity3 is in our view outrageous and improper , certainly for someone for whom the spirit of liberty lies at the basis of his human and academic mission , ' @entity73 said , calling the imposition of a boycott incompatible with open , democratic dialogue			0
the @entity3 ambassador to @entity107 , @entity106 , called it a ' great shame ' , adding : ' rather than caving into pressure from political extremists , active participation in such events is a far more constructive way to promote progress and peace			0
' he noted that former world leaders including @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 plan to attend the conference			2
@entity0 's decision was hailed by the @entity124 for the @entity125 as support for its goal of severing academics ' connections with @entity3			1

' we tried to communicate two points to him , ' he said			0
' @entity143 , that @entity3 is a colonial entity that involves violations of the rights of the @entity8 , including academic freedom , and then asking him to stand in solidarity with @entity8 academic colleagues who have called for solidarity from international academics in the form of boycotting @entity3 academia and academic institutions			0

world - famous scientist had agreed to attend @entity11
