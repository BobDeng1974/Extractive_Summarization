by @entity0 published : 13:36 est , 28 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:15 est , 28 february 2014 blow : entrepreneur @entity4 was dealt a crushing blow as judges ruled a rival to his @entity11 children 's suitcase does not infringe on his design rights a @entity13 reject who has sold two million of his children 's ride - on suitcases was today dealt a crippling blow as judges ruled a rival product does not infringe on his design rights			1
@entity4 left the @entity21 in 2006 dismayed after each of the @entity13 ruled ' i 'm out ' , after the strap on his prototype broke during a demonstration			1
but the entrepreneur fought to make the @entity11 a success , and today turns over £ 7million a year			1
by 2011 , 20 per cent of @entity30 three to six year olds owned one of the ride - on pull - along children 's cases , which can be designed with a number of different animal and insect motifs			1
but trouble began to brew when @entity39 , @entity40 of @entity42 - based @entity41 , spotted a @entity11 while on his travels in 2010			2
@entity41 began marketing a rival product , the @entity45 , setting the scene for a legal battle over the design			1
@entity50 judges today ruled that the ' more rounded ' shape of the @entity45 - which comes in animal and insect designs - is ' very different ' to the @entity11 's ' sleek and stylised ' appearance			1
lord @entity55 said : ' the @entity45 is softer and more rounded and evocative of an insect with antennae or an animal with floppy ears			0
' the @entity50 ’s decision that the @entity45 does not breach the @entity11 ’s community registered design rights is a disaster for mr @entity4 and his company , @entity64 , effectively opening up the @entity66 market to its discount competitor			1
@entity68 - based mr @entity4 was a student at @entity69 when he was nominated as a finalist for the @entity71			2
given the brief to produce ' a design for luggage ' , he was inspired to design a child 's bag , after visiting a toy shop			0
the prototype , which he dubbed the ' rodeo ' - was awarded the top prize			0
but mr @entity4 's success came back to haunt him in court as @entity41 argued the ' rodeo ' design had been honoured publicly at the 1998 prize ceremony , long before the design rights were registered for the @entity11 in 2003			1
while no one disputed that the @entity11 was an ‘ innovative design ’ - and it was accepted that the @entity45 was ' inspired by ' its rival - @entity41 pointed to a photograph of mr law at the award ceremony and argued the @entity11 ’s design rights were invalidated by the publicity			1
ruling on the dispute today , @entity114 said that the differences in the rival products ’ shape , decoration , and colour meant that the possibility of parents being confused between them was slight			0
design : his invention is made from the same material as adult suitcase brands and can be ridden like a toy demonstration : he sat on one of his products during his appearance in front of the @entity13 in 2006			2
but he left the @entity21 disappointed as one by one the @entity13 declared ' i 'm out ' describing the insect version of the @entity45 , he said : ' it looks like a ladybird and the handles on its forehead look like antennae			0
' overall the shape conveys a completely different impression from that of the @entity11			0
' although there were ‘ some similarities at a general level ’ , the judge , sitting with @entity154 and @entity155 , said : ' i think the impression conveyed to the informed user by the designs of the two versions of the @entity45 is very different from that of the @entity11			0
' there were , he said ' many significant differences ' between the profile of the two products as well as their colour and decoration			0
curious : the @entity13 were initially impressed with the product , with @entity165 and @entity166 ( second and third from right ) calling it ' cute ' dreams dashed : mr @entity4 felt the investment slipping away when @entity172 managed to break one of the straps he added : ' the overall impression created by the two designs is very different			2
the impression created by the @entity11 is that of a horned animal			0
' it is a sleek and stylised design and , from the side , has a generally asymmetrical appeareance ... by contrast , the design of the @entity45 is softer and more rounded and evocative of an insect with antennae or an animal with floppy ears			2
' at both a general and detailed level , the @entity45 conveys a very different impression			0

@entity4 was sent *packing* from the @entity13 in 2006 after a strap on his children 's ride - on suitcase broke during a demonstration
he has since sold two million cases and turns over £ 7million a year
but in 2010 a rival firm @entity41 marketed a new product , the @entity45 , *sparking* a legal battle
@entity50 judges today ruled the ' more rounded ' @entity203 is ' very different ' to the @entity11 's ' sleek and stylised ' appearance
@entity50 ruled the @entity45 does not breach mr @entity4 's design rights
