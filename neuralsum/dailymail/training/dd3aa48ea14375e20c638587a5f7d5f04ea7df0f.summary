@entity0 are keen on taking @entity1 on loan if negotiations develop with @entity4 over @entity5			1
@entity1 impressed on loan at @entity7 and has continued his form with @entity9 in the @entity10			2
@entity0 want @entity5 out and have interest from @entity12 but hope @entity4 follow up initial interest and like the idea of a deal for fleet - footed @entity1 in the process			1
@entity30 has attracted interest from @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 also but their is a growing belief he fancies a move to @entity38 who made enquiries last week			1
@entity31 are already losing @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 while @entity44 could yet join @entity45			2
they have an interest in @entity47 at @entity48 but have yet to make a bid			0
running riot : @entity30 ( right ) starred in their 2 - 0 @entity51 win against @entity53 on wednesday @entity33 willing to sell @entity54 and @entity55 @entity33 , as well as wanting @entity56 , have made a £ 12million opening bid for @entity59 's @entity58 in what is seen as a precursor to @entity54 going the other way in a separate deal			1
@entity38 want £ 25m and a buy - back clause on coveted striker @entity58 while @entity33 are understood to be willing to sell @entity54 and @entity55 despite protestations that both are key figures at the club			1
there is no doubt both are influential players but business - savvy @entity33 believe this summer may be the best time to cash in on both for optimum price			0
on the move ? @entity33 have made a £ 12million bid for @entity59 forward @entity58 ( left ) @entity54 was one of @entity78 's heroes against @entity53 on wednesday night and is highly regarded across @entity79			1
@entity38 have been asked to stump up £ 40m for the 27 - year - old while @entity45 remain firm favourites for @entity55			1
the former @entity35 midfielder looks more accomplished on every performance and , while there will be clubs here who want to take him , @entity45 have the resources and players such as @entity90 and @entity91 to be offered as part of any £ 50m deal			1
@entity58 's departure from @entity38 meanwhile will signal their search for another striker			0
there is little doubt that they will make an attempt to bid for @entity101 at @entity34 but they also want a different style of forward who can give them another option from the bench			0
double trouble ? @entity33 are willling to sell @entity54 ( left ) and @entity55 ( right ) this summer @entity110 offered @entity112 winger @entity111 @entity110 have been offered @entity112 winger @entity111 from @entity113 but are also considering highly - rated @entity115 winger @entity114			1
the 24 - year - old @entity111 was a target in recent seasons for @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 and his club have had further enquiries from @entity33 and @entity48			2
at £ 5million he represents good value , however , @entity114 is seen as one of the brightest young talents in @entity53			2
@entity126 pedidgree : @entity110 have been offered @entity112 winger @entity111 ( right ) @entity127 , @entity59 and @entity31 have all watched him closely and @entity115 initially signed him ahead of @entity38			1
the 18 - year - old is fast and skilful and has an affordable buy - out clause understood to be around £ 3m but that is due to more than double next year			0
the big clubs are maintaining an interest but know they have other wingers who would block his path of progression at this stage			0
@entity138 make £ 8million bid for @entity28 's @entity140 @entity138 are understood to have placed an £ 8million bid for @entity140 at @entity142			1
the @entity143 starred again for his national side in their comfortable win over @entity147 on wednesday night and topped his performance with an impressive goal			0
that may not help @entity138 though if @entity142 decide to let his performances dictate an auction			2
they already have interest gathering in @entity157 midfielder @entity156 and @entity160 international left - back @entity158 and their valuations are suitably prohibitive to discourage time wasters			0
@entity156 has been asked about by @entity31 , @entity35 , @entity4 and @entity164 but will cost a minimum £ 28million and @entity34 target @entity158 will be £ 21m as quoted to @entity167 this week			1
if that pattern is anything to go by then @entity138 may find themselves priced out of a deal			0
goal : @entity138 target @entity140 ( top ) scored for @entity28 in their 4 - 0 @entity174 a win against @entity147 @entity177 off to @entity178 ? @entity177 is attracting attention from @entity180 and @entity138 as they consider alternatives to their forward targets			1
however , the more intriguing interest is coming from the @entity184 where @entity185 and @entity142 have taken note of his goalscoring exploits			1
the 21 - year - old has one year left on contract and @entity191 insist he will not be sold this summer yet foreign sides recognise he would cost less in compensation if he were to join them and they will be keen observers of his performances in the @entity198 next season			0
@entity177 was released by @entity199 as a teenager but was picked up by @entity201 before joining @entity191 for just over £ 1m in 2011			2
he won @entity202 at @entity204 awards and scored 26 goals in 45 games last season			0
guten tag ? @entity191 's @entity177 has attracted interest from @entity178 outfits @entity185 and @entity142 @entity210 in talks with @entity212 @entity213 are discussing a deal for former @entity215 goalkeeper @entity212			1
the 21 - year - old free agent started his career at @entity127 before joining @entity215 in 2007 and had subsequent loan spells at @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221			0
he will provide cover for @entity223 and @entity224			0
safe hands : @entity213 are in talks to sign former @entity215 goalkeeper @entity212 as their third - choice @entity229 offered @entity231 striker @entity230 @entity229 have been offered 28 - year - old @entity231 striker @entity230			1
@entity157 - born but with an @entity235 passport , @entity231 president @entity233 said : ' i can confirm a proposal from @entity238			0
they made a very serious offer and we 're talking about it to see if we can find an agreement			0
' talking to @entity245 , he added : ' what i can say is that the negotiations have started and in the coming hours we will know more about this , with everything still open , and talk to the player to work out the best opportunity			0
@entity252 have already spoken with @entity230 , but @entity229 also want him and there are also a couple of other @entity256 clubs			2
' the 28 - year - old impressed in @entity258 last season and scored 15 times in 35 games , also providing six assists for his team - mates , yet @entity229 ideally want younger players and maintain an interest in signing 18 - year - old @entity31 winger @entity266 on loan			1
potent : @entity231 striker @entity230 scored 15 times in 35 @entity258 games for the club last season @entity45 admit defeat in @entity274 pursuit @entity275 has seemingly conceded defeat in his efforts to prise @entity274 from @entity164			1
@entity278 champions @entity45 were poised to offer £ 61m for the former @entity280 playmaker but @entity281 insisted they would be wasting their time and has signalled discussions over a new contract for the @entity285			2
@entity275 said : ' hazard is a top player , but i think @entity164 want to keep him			2
a lot of players are going to be mentioned , but we have already got our priority , @entity292			0
' no go : @entity45 boss @entity275 admits it will be unlikely @entity295 's @entity274 ( bottom ) will leave @entity164 @entity298 's @entity297 in @entity215 move ? incoming joint - @entity298 owner @entity299 says forward @entity297 has been offered a deal to sign for @entity302			1
the 29 - year - old striker has been with @entity298 since 2011 and scored nine goals in 43 appearances last season			0
lucrative deal : @entity298 face a battle to hold onto @entity297 who was offered a better wage at @entity302 @entity299 said : ' we have unfortunately lost ( @entity312 ) @entity311 and @entity297 as they had to take a 50 per cent wage cut			0
' @entity297 has been offered 10 grand a week by @entity302 , you ca n't compete with that			0
