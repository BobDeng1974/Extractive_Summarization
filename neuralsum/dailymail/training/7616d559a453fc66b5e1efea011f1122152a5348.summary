set in the idyllic @entity2 , surrounded by countryside and views of the moor , a cockerel 's call may not seem too unexpected			1
but for one bird , his early morning wake - up calls have led to an asbo			0
the owners of @entity11 , or @entity12 , the cockerel have been given a noise abatement notice to stop their bird making such a noise , after a complaint from a neighbour that he was waking him up too early			1
@entity12 the cockerel has been waking neighbours up for three months at 4am and has now been given an @entity9 @entity22 and @entity23 with @entity24 - the offending cockerel - at their @entity27 home the noisy cockerel lives on the farm belonging to @entity23 and @entity30 in @entity31 along with the rest of the couple 's birds			1
they say other neighbours have never raised any problems with the bird			0
mr @entity23 said : ' it 's all a bit ridiculous - a bird having an asbo - type order			2
we 've done everything we can and so far we 've managed to reduce the noise , but not put a stop to it			2
' our neighbours have been living with the crows for three years since we moved here - and we consulted with them at the time to check it was okay			0
' the couple said they keep birds as a hobby			0
the asbo was given after @entity57 , 51 , complained to @entity2			1
@entity12 lives in the @entity2 in the village of @entity31 , which is popular with walkers and visitors to the @entity61 mr and mrs @entity30 have been given the winter to try and soundproof @entity64 's pen to stop noise complaints @entity12 has been the subject of complaints by @entity68 because of his regular 4am calls at the farm in @entity31 he said : ' this is not a farming community anymore			1
it 's mainly tourism now and most of the people who live here are either retired or commuters			0
' and the fact that mr @entity23 has a field at the bottom of his garden does not make it a farm			0
i would not have moved in next to a farm , but this is a residential area			0
' mr @entity57 said he has been the subject of abuse since he made the complaint and it was made public			1
he said : ' firstly , i do not want to kill the cockerel - i want this to be resolved in a way that pleases everybody			0
the @entity93 said they have never had any problems with people complaining about @entity12 's noise before ' but for three months i 've been woken up every day at 4am and that 's with double glazing			1
i work full - time and can not cope without a proper nights ' sleep			2
' he claims in online criticism he has been called a ' townie ' and is starting to fear for his safety			0
but mr @entity57 said that now the mornings are darker - and the problem is not so pronounced - he is happy to ' put the situation on ice ' until spring to give mr and mrs @entity30 time to sound - proof @entity11 's pen			1
mr @entity23 said he welcomed @entity57 's compromise and vowed to resolve the issue .			2
