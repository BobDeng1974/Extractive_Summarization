a conman who wore a @entity2 uniform to trick people into donating cash for @entity5 has been jailed for three - and - a - half years			1
@entity6 , 32 , stood outside train stations and other public places with a red @entity5 bucket			1
he claimed he was a serving sergeant in the special forces who had been given authorisation by the charity to collect the much - needed money			1
@entity6 ( pictured right posing in a @entity2 uniform ) was sentenced to prison for the heartless scam but a court heard that @entity6 was a convicted fraudster with no military links who pocketed the money himself - including more than £ 500 in a single day			1
he was caught when he tried to board a train , again in full uniform , using a fake military free travel pass and a suspicious inspector noted his details			2
when police searched his home they found five military id cards in bogus names			2
a cv claiming to list military experience and a letter of recommendation from brigadier general @entity36 of the @entity37 were also found			1
they also discovered a folder of credit card details belonging to guests at a hotel where @entity6 had worked			2
he was jailed for three and a half years yesterday after admitting 12 counts of fraud			1
@entity47 @entity46 heard he had a lengthy list of previous convictions beginning when he was 17 , which included numerous charges of fraud using the military			2
judge @entity54 told him : ' the public standing of a charity and the trust of a public in a charity is a very high and important standard that needs to be maintained			0
' by behaving in this fashion you have risked a very serious goodwill damage to that charity and i regard that as extremely heinous			0
' he added : ' these sentences will get longer and longer if you keep offending in this way			0
' i hope in time you reflect on this behaviour and you will find better things to do with your time when you are released			0
' the court heard that @entity6 , of @entity77 , @entity78 , started his scam just days after being released from prison in december 2013 following an 18 month sentence for fraud			1
he applied to collect for @entity5 with the intention of conning the public again			0
@entity6 was sentenced to three - and - a - half years in prison when he appeared at @entity86 ( pictured ) today in april last year he tried to board a train in @entity77 wearing a military uniform , including the coveted green @entity2 beret , and showed a ticket collector a letter from the @entity92 giving him free travel			1
before police were able to arrest him he turned up at the same station a month later , again in uniform , and approached a different inspector			0
the inspector followed him on board where he noticed @entity6 quickly changed out of his clothes			0
unaware of the ongoing investigation into his background , @entity6 appeared outside @entity105 's @entity104 in october purporting to collect for @entity5			1
@entity107 , prosecuting , told the court : ' the defendant was wearing a full military sergeant 's uniform and was using a red @entity5 bucket			1
' he was challenged and a witness took a picture of his @entity115			0
' the charity said @entity6 had applied to be a collector in december 2013 but had the authorisation rescinded in februrary because he made no donations and did n't return any merchandise , including a so - called ' shop in a box ' worth £ 250			1
' on november 4 , the defendant was seen boarding a train at @entity125 where a police officer recognised him			0
' he was in possession of two @entity5 buckets , one of which he had collected £ 513 in small change			2
' again he was wearing the uniform of a @entity133 and had two fake id cards and a letter purporting to be from @entity5 authorising him to collect			2
' @entity136 , defending , said : ' a large extent of why he was detected is because he went back to the scene of the original crime			0
' you would have thought having had his details photographed he would have got away from there , but there seemed to be - if not a death wish - then no great attempt to conceal his actions			0
' there is no hint of self pity and he does n't ask anyone to give him any either			0
