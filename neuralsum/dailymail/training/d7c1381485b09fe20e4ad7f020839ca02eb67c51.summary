by @entity0 published : 08:27 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 08:30 est , 15 march 2013 a bronze and enamel cockerel placed in the grave of a two year old @entity5 girl as a message to the @entity7 has gone on display after a ' stunning ' restoration			1
archaeologists made the discovery in @entity12 two years ago , and say it is only of only eight known in the @entity14			1
they believe the expensive gift was placed in the grave by loving parents hoping it would ease their daughter 's transition into the ' next world '			1
the magnificent cockerel was found in child 's grave in @entity12 - and has been painstakingly restored			1
it goes on show in the historic town today the cockerel had special significance to the @entity5 and there is a known connection to the god @entity32			0
statues of this god , including one in the @entity36 , commonly show a cockerel at the base			0
the association probably stems from @entity32 ’s role as the messenger to the gods and that of the cockerel as ‘ announcer ’ of the new dawn			2
@entity32 was also the ‘ herdsman for the dead ’ , guiding newly deceased souls on their passage to the afterlife			0
it is therefore possible that the cockerel was an offering by a devotee of @entity32 and expresses a parent ’s particular concern to ensure safe transit of a loved one into the after world			0
the child was buried wearing hobnailed shoes and was accompanied by a pottery feeding vessel and the remarkable enamelled bronze figurine of a cockerel			1
the cockerel stands 125mm high and the breast , wings , eyes and ‘ comb ’ are inlaid with enamel , which now appears blue and green			0
there is a separately moulded tail plate , also enamelled , with ‘ openwork ’ decoration			2
the beak is shown open , in the act of crowing			0
today the restored bird went on show in the @entity81 town where it was found			1
its finders , the @entity84 group , say it ' looks absolutely fantastic			0
' the 12.5cm bronze figure is thought to have been placed in the child 's grave as a message to the gods			1
it is believed that the @entity5 gave religious significance to the cockerel which was known to be connected with @entity32			0
experts say it was @entity32 , a messenger to the gods , that was also responsible for conducting newly - deceased souls to the afterlife			1
the conservation work took four months to be painstakingly carried out by experts			0
archaeologist @entity103 , from @entity104 , said the work had ' exceeded expectations ' , particularly for highlighting its fine enamel detail			0
' it reinforces what a fantastic article this is and how highly prized and expensive it must have been , ' he said			0
' this must have cost , in current money , thousands of pounds to buy and countless hours to make , and so to actually put this into the grave of a two or three - year - old child is not something that you would do lightly			1
' it really shows that this was a very wealthy , important family , and signifies the love that the parents had for the dead child			2
' the cockerel was found during excavation work at the former @entity129 site on @entity130 in @entity12 - or @entity131 as it was known when it was the second largest town in @entity133			1
the parts of the cockerel , found in child 's grave in @entity12 , which were restored and put back together to a ' stunning ' condition a burial site was unearthed at the site including more than 40 burials and four cremations ; something experts said was the largest archaeological find in the town since the 1970s			1
this particular figurine is one of only four ever found in @entity133 , with a total of eight known from the whole of the @entity14			1
mr @entity103 added : ' without a doubt this is the best @entity5 cockerel ever found in @entity133			2
' this is the best find that i have seen come out of @entity12 in 30 to 40 years and is of national significance			1
' the object is believed to have been made in northern @entity133 , with evidence pointing to a workshop in @entity158 , @entity159 , which made enamel artefacts			0
talks are under way to find a permanent display site for the cockerel , possibly at the @entity36 in @entity12			2
only eight similar cockerel figurines are known from the @entity5 world , including four from @entity133			0
the similarities in construction and decoration suggest that they were made at roughly the same time and could have come from the same workshop			0
our example is the only one from @entity133 to have come from a grave and the only one from any location to have survived with a tail			2
the two which are closest in form are from @entity180 in @entity181 and @entity182 in the @entity183			0
in these examples the enamelling survives in the original colours of yellow , blue and red and it is probable that the @entity12 example was originally just as brightly coloured			2
@entity133 produced some of the finest enamelled objects in the @entity14 and these were traded as far afield as @entity181 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195			1
the four enamelled cockerels from the continent all come from @entity181 and the @entity198 .			2

enamelled bird was was found in a child 's grave in @entity12 two years ago - and is is only of only eight known in the @entity14 .
12.5cm bronze figure is thought to have been placed in the child 's grave as a message to the gods
