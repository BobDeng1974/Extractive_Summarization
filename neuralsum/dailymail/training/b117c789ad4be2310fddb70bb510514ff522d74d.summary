by @entity0 published : 18:56 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 03:18 est , 25 january 2014 welcome to modern football , the @entity4 family			0
welcome to the game everyone else plays — are you ready for what lies ahead ? @entity10 ’s owners have had it easy since they arrived here in 2005			1
they relied upon the genius of sir @entity13 to keep producing teams who enabled them to stay at the top			2
their ownership has resulted in five @entity21 titles , three @entity22 and a @entity23 but those trophies had nothing to do with bold statements in the transfer market			1
they were down to the inspiration of @entity13			0
success : sir @entity13 ensured a continuous flow of trophies despite @entity10 's relatively modest net spend history : now sir @entity13 has retired , @entity10 are going to have spend more to be competitive now , with @entity10 facing a huge fight to get into the top four , they need a new approach			1
they need to show they are prepared to spend			0
the clubs who stay at the head of the game invest in the future from positions of strength , which is why the signing of @entity49 is intriguing			2
is this a pointer to the future or simply a break from the norm ? do not think for one moment the £ 37million paid for @entity49 will cure all @entity10 ’s ills			1
to get back to where they were under @entity13 , dominating domestically and constantly posing a threat in @entity59 , they need another three or four of those transfers			1
goodbyes : @entity10 need to spend more money than the £ 37million @entity49 they will pay @entity63 for @entity49 new challenge : @entity49 will be hoping to spend more time on the pitch for @entity10 than he did at @entity63 @entity10 have never been afraid of spending but since the last time they broke their transfer record — for @entity69 ( £ 30.75m ) in 2008 , four months after they won the @entity23 in @entity71 — their rivals have been bold			1
the @entity4 , by contrast , have been complacent and the evidence across @entity59 stacks up against them — none of the clubs they want to compete with have hesitated when it comes to paying massive fees			2
@entity79 have gone beyond £ 80m twice since 2009 ; last summer @entity80 paid £ 51m for @entity81 ; @entity82 went higher to get @entity83 , as did @entity84 when they landed @entity85			2
record : @entity79 were prepared to spend £ 86 on @entity87 last summer , a world - record fee previous highest fee : @entity69 held the record for the biggest @entity10 transfer fee , at £ 30.75m , before @entity49 quality does not come cheaply and @entity93 explained to me in december the moment @entity96 realised they would be fighting an uphill battle if they did n’t follow the lead of others and spend big			1
it revolved around the @entity102 midfielder @entity101			2
@entity96 were debating spending € 40m , but ultimately the question came down to , ‘ would he make a difference ? ’ the answer was ‘ yes ’ and @entity101 ended up playing a key role in @entity96 winning the @entity109			1
other than @entity112 , how many players capable of making a difference have @entity10 bought since @entity113 left in 2009 ? in that time , their net spend has been £ 68m , dwarfed by the likes of @entity79 ( £ 307m ) , @entity63 ( £ 306m ) and @entity116 ( £ 367 )			1
even @entity117 ( £ 72.5m ) have spent more			2
@entity49 will make a difference to @entity10			1
if he produces the numbers he did for @entity63 — he has been directly involved in 45 goals ( scored 18 , assisted 27 ) since 2011 — then they have a chance of pegging back @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 in the race for the top four			0
his arrival will also lift a squad who are on their knees following the latest setback against @entity133 ; nothing beats seeing a quality addition walk into the dressing room and @entity137 will hope @entity49 can do for his squad what @entity139 did for @entity13 in 1992 — add quality and galvanise those around him			1
but the men who hold the key to @entity10 ’s future are the @entity4			2
are they going to stand up to the challenges of modern football , or are they going to coast along without any real spending ? if they choose the latter option , this season is unlikely to prove a one - off			1
made the difference : @entity96 spent 40m euros on @entity101 ( centre ) who helped win the @entity109 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... thrills at the top , chills at the bottom the most exciting @entity21 season of recent years has had the unusual impact of removing a word we use frequently from our conversations — mid-table			1
think about it : the @entity23 is so open that practically every club in the top flight has something to play for with 16 games left and nobody is just drifting along			2
@entity170 , @entity116 and @entity63 are fighting to be champions ; the four teams below them are involved in a tremendous scrap to secure the final @entity23 place , while eighth - placed @entity176 will feel they can still qualify for the @entity177			0
table toppers : @entity170 currently lead the way in the @entity21 , one point ahead of @entity116 threat : @entity183 , scoring here against @entity116 , may be bottom of the table , but can still trouble the top teams @entity187 are 10th with 24 points , but given that bottom club @entity183 have 18 , not one team in that pack will be able to relax , with the fear of relegation haunting them			1
that just leaves @entity196 , who are ninth with 31 points , looking isolated			0
of course , the situation will change over the coming weeks but as we look forward to another round of matches in midweek , it is brilliant to see such interest being generated			0
you only have to think back to this stage 12 months ago when everyone knew @entity208 and @entity209 were going down and @entity10 effectively had the title sewn up			2
what we have now is what football should be all about			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... no excuses if @entity133 drop @entity133 fully deserve their first trip to @entity215 since 1992 and they should enjoy every minute of the @entity217 final			1
in no way , though , should their progress in this competition be used as an excuse for the position they currently occupy in the @entity21 table — and if they end up being relegated in may , they should not compare themselves to either @entity228 or @entity229			1
@entity228 , of course , went down in 2011 after dramatically winning the @entity217			0
but when they beat @entity170 at @entity215 , they had two games in hand on their relegation rivals and were just one win away from going 10th in the table			0
ecstasy : the @entity133 players celebrate after their @entity217 penalty shootout joy against @entity10 no excuses : given some of the results @entity133 have had this season , they should beat the drop @entity246 — they took just nine points from the final 12 games — led to @entity228 ’s season unravelling			1
@entity229 ’s situation was different as all their high - pressure games came at the end of last season and it eventually it became emotionally and physically draining ; remember , they played in the @entity254 final four days before they had to go to @entity170 and win to stand any chance of surviving			2
@entity133 , by contrast , will have plenty of time after the march 2 final to try to save their top - flight status			1
a team who have beaten @entity116 and @entity125 in the @entity21 , and knocked @entity10 and @entity63 out of the @entity217 , clearly have the talent to stay @entity264 they fail to do that , they will only have themselves to blame because they should n’t have any other distraction			1
my top five ... @entity254 potential shocks the fourth - round draw might be lacking a blockbuster tie but that does not mean the @entity254 will be a breeze this weekend for the @entity21 sides in action			1
if anything , the opposite will be true as plenty of teams in the lower divisions will be out to make a statement			0
1 @entity228 v @entity281 it has been alarming to see @entity281 ’s form tail off so badly and @entity284 will see this fixture as a chance to restore some confidence			0
@entity228 , though , will have other ideas and will be looking for @entity289 to get into dangerous areas			0
banana skin : @entity228 will be looking for @entity289 to get into dangerous areas against inconsistent @entity281 2 @entity292 v @entity183 @entity183 sprang a surprise at @entity176 in the last round but their form since has been poor and @entity292 , in need of a lift after being thrashed 7 - 1 at @entity209 , could upset them			0
@entity299 , back last month from a cruciate injury , can dictate in the @entity292 midfield			0
orchestrator : @entity299 can dictate @entity292 's midfield against @entity183 after returning from injury 3 @entity305 v @entity306 @entity307 is a compact little stadium , the type you associate with giant - killings , and this tie has the ingredients for another — not least as @entity305 manager @entity314 is taking on his old club			2
@entity306 will have to keep an eye on @entity305 ’s leading scorer , @entity317			0
danger man : @entity305 's leading scorer @entity317 ( centre ) will be one for @entity306 to look out for 4 @entity229 v @entity320 the holders survived a scare against @entity323 and now they will be aiming to create a shock of their own			0
@entity320 have done well since @entity325 took over but it will be difficult for them at the @entity327			0
where @entity320 dare : @entity254 holders @entity229 survived a scare against @entity323 but could cause @entity320 problems 5 @entity331 v @entity330 after dumping @entity187 out in the last round , @entity331 under @entity332 will fancy their chances of making the last 16 , especially with home advantage			0
@entity330 are vulnerable with relegation fears on their mind			0
bigger things : with relegation on their mind , @entity330 could take their eye off the ball against @entity331			0

@entity10 will need to *buy* more players of £ 37m @entity49 's calibre if they *'re* to challenge at the top
@entity10 *lag* behind their rivals , both domestically and in @entity59 , in terms of spending on new players
@entity96 cite the 40m euros they spent on @entity101 as the player that ' made the difference ' in their treble - winning season
the most exciting @entity21 in years has practically removed mid-table
@entity133 will have no excuses if they get relegated this season
