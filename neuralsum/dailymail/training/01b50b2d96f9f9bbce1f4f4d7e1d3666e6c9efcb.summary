there is a speech which @entity2 hoped to deliver today which will have to remain in the @entity5 drawer for a few years yet			1
it is the one where the chancellor declares that the deficit has been eliminated and the government is raising more in tax than it spends			1
in 2010 mr @entity2 confidently declared that he would balance the books by 2014 - 15 , but today he was forced admit that borrowing remains stubbornly high and balancing the books is still a long way off			1
in june 2010 , the @entity16 predicted that in 2014 - 15 borrowing would fall to just £ 37billion , but it has remained high at around £ 100billion and is not expected to return a surplus until 2018 - 19 in 2010 @entity2 remained confident that borrowing would fall sharply , but in 2011 and 2012 a deterioration in the economic picture meant the prospect of balancing the books slipped further into the future in 2010 , the @entity24 predicted that borrowing would be just £ 37billion in 2014 - 15			1
instead it will be £ 91.3billion , which is still £ 5billion higher than the @entity16 predicted in march this year			2
while there are record numbers of people in work , many are in low paid jobs			0
these workers have benefitted most from the coalition policy of not paying income on the first £ 10,000 of earnings			2
but it means the @entity5 is raising less than expected from taxes to offset spending			1
four years ago in june 2010 mr @entity2 boasted that he would have ' eliminated ' the deficit by 2014 - 15			1
' we have set the course for a balanced budget and falling national debt by the end of this @entity47 , ' he predicted in the @entity49 's emergency budget			0
instead borrowing has remained stubbornly high , and barely changed in the last 12 months			0
revealing that the deficit has been halved over this @entity47 , mr @entity2 said the @entity16 now forecasts the deficit will fall slightly from £ 97.5 billion last year to £ 91.3 billion this year - rather than the £ 86.4billion previously expected			1
mr @entity2 will boast that the economy is now growing strongly , and faster than most other countries			2
but its has failed to keep pace with the predictions made in 2010 national debt as a proportion of the economy ( gdp ) was supposed to start falling in 2013 - 14 , but has instead been rising and is not expected to peak until next year borrowing for 2015 - 16 is expected to fall to £ 75.9 billion , worse than the £ 68.3 billion previously expected			1
but the outlook for 2016 - 17 of a £ 40.9 billion shortfall is better than the £ 41.5billion previously set out			2
for 2017 - 18 expected borrowing is likely to be £ 14.5billion , an improvement on the previously pencilled - in £ 15.8 billion			1
mr @entity2 told @entity66 that by 2019 - 20 the @entity67 will be spending £ 23billion less than it raises in tax			1
' out of the red and into the black for the first time in a generation - a country that inspires confidence around the world because it seeks to live within its means , ' he added			0
it still means that the country will not be in a position where it is spending less than it raises in tax , until 2018 - 19 - a decade after the financial crash			0
the @entity16 said : ' despite stronger growth , we have revised up our estimate of the budget deficit this year			2
' in headline terms , the @entity67 economy has outperformed our march forecast			0
' but wage and productivity growth have once again disappointed , while national income and spending have outperformed most in those areas that yield least tax revenue			2
' several times mr @entity2 claimed that he had brought the @entity67 economy back from the brink over the last four years			1
the chancellor used his @entity98 to plead for time to ' finish the job ' , warning a change of course now would ' squander ' prosperity			0
four years ago the @entity16 hoped for strong growth in pay , but low wages have persisted and have only just started to outstrip inflation he revealed growth in this year is now expected to hit 3 per cent , up from 2.7 per cent forecast in march this year			1
and he told mps that under the coalition , @entity67 has created 1,000 jobs every day since 2010			2
but in future years , growth is forecast to be lower than previously thought			2
the @entity16 now it forecasts growth of 2.4 per cent in 2015 , 2.2 per cent in 2016 , then 2.4 per cent , 2.3 per cent and 2.3 per cent in subsequent years			2
unemployment has also fallen sharply , dropping to just 6 per cent for the first time since autumn 2008			0
pay is also rising faster than the cost of living for the first time in five years			0
average earnings are 1.3 per cent higher than a year ago , compared to inflation running at 1.2 per cent , with workers in the private sector enjoying even higher pay rises			1
the @entity16 predicts wages will rise by 1.8 per cent this year , 2 per cent next year and 3.1 per cent in 2016			0
employment has surged above expectations , breaking through 30million a year earlier than expected			1
latest figures show there are 30.8million in work , a figure which was not expected to be reached until 2016			1
with total debt still rising to the vicinity of £ 1.4 trillion , mr @entity2 is set to have borrowed more in five years at the @entity5 than @entity135 chancellors did in 13			1
time and again the chancellor has seen the economic forecasts shift , with hopes of balancing the books drifting further into the future			0
@entity67 will still not be back in the black , spending less than it raises in tax , until 2018 - 19 , a decade after the financial crash			1
@entity135 's shadow chancellor @entity145 said : ' it 's all here in black and white , hard evidence from the @entity149 that the chancellor 's borrowing targets are all in tatters			0
' we all know he 's changed the way he styles his hair but he ca n't brush away the facts			0
people are worse off and he 's failed to balance the books in this @entity47			0
' i 've got to say , for all his strutting , for all his preening , for all his claims to have fixed the economy , he promised to make people better off , working people are worse off			0
' he promised we were all in this together and he cut taxes for millionaires			0
he promised to balance the books in this @entity47 and that commitment is now in tatters			0
every target missed , every test failed , every promise broken			0

in 2010 , @entity2 boasted he would have ' eliminated ' the deficit by 2014 - 15
but new figures show @entity67 will borrow around £ *91billion* this year
@entity5 is raising less in income tax than thought earlier this year
economic growth has been strong but failed to match 2010 forecasts
pay rises have also been well below expectations four years ago
but employment has soared above 30million much sooner than expected
