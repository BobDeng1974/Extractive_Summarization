' after her half - day , @entity4 jumped in a private jet to dash up to the @entity53 , leaving @entity54 to take her place in the afternoon			1
good impression : the 21 - year - old pleased bosses on monday so was invited back for a second day - albeit a half - day @entity4 tweeted a photo of herself by her private plane : ' just left the @entity60 thank you so much @ xfactor and everyone there for having me ! jumping straight on a plane to do a show with coldplay !

they have gone through the proper process			0
it 's not fair on them			0

' this is the way to travel : @entity4 climbed into a private jet up to @entity8 after her half - day at the auditions news of @entity4 's popularity will come as a blow to @entity117 , who was hoping to land the spot permanently after @entity120 's departure however , she failed to impress at last week 's @entity122 auditions and show bosses are said to have ruled out the former @entity125 star joining the @entity127 show			1
a source told @entity130 newspaper : ' @entity117 had a lot of energy and tried her hardest to make an impression			0
