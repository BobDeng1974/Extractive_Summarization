by @entity0 published : 18:18 est , 8 february 2013 updated : 18:18 est , 8 february 2013 it may sound like something out of the @entity3 but a groundbreaking new invention could transform the way we power our lives by using our bodyheat to generate electricity			1
@entity10 has developed a light - weight film that sticks to skin and gathers heat energy emitted from the body which is then converted in to electricity			1
the device - called a thermoelectric converter - means we may soon be able to charge our smartphones while out and about by simply using our own energy			1
the development could bring an end to the traditional method of using battery chargers from electrical points to power our phones			0
demonstration : @entity10 has created a high - efficiency thermoelectric converter with organic material which can convert heat off the human body in to electricity and with the aid of solar panels to make the conversion more effective , the generator may also be able to charge larger electrical items such as laptops and ereaders			1
as well as powering our ever - increasingly high - tech lives , the inventors also hope the device can be worn on the skin by patients to charge their medical devices			1
the organic polymer material was created by @entity46 jointly with @entity47 â€™s @entity48 ( @entity48 )			0
it can detect a temperature change from the surrounding environment of just one degree celsius meaning it starts producing electricity the moment it touches the skin			2
similar organic products have been created in the past but the new material is far more efficient than any other converter seen before			0
breakthrough : scientists have created an organic polymer material which sticks to the skin and is activated by a temperature change of just one degree celsius it can also be made in a printing press meaning it can be made to almost virtually any size needed			1
the material is also flexible so can be wrapped around different body parts			0
the @entity10 device was unveiled at the nanotech 2013 conference in @entity74 where the latest inventions and gadgets are revealed to the world			2
a live demonstration was given at the show where a person pressed their hand against the material and a toy car began moving around a track			0
the new conversion material was not the only product the company unveiled - they also showed off new speakers that can be rolled up			0
@entity10 will release futher details of the device at the 60th @entity91 2013 , taking place between march 27 to 30,in @entity93 , @entity47 .			2
