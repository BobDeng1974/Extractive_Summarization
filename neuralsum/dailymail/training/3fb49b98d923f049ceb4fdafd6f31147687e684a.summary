house speaker @entity0 told the nation 's leader in a face - to - face meeting on friday in no uncertain terms that he could kiss real reforms to the immigration system goodbye if he followed through on his plans to give up to 11 million illegal immigrants amnesty			1
a statement from @entity0 's office after today 's @entity12 meeting with congressional leaders says ' the speaker warned that unilateral action by the president on executive amnesty will erase any chances of doing immigration reform and will also make it harder for @entity21 and the @entity12 to work together successfully on other areas where there might otherwise be common ground			1
' in a statement of its own after the strategy session the @entity12 said that @entity28 still intends to act before the end of the year , regardless of the @entity31 's opposition to the move			1
' before the post-election summit @entity57 told reporters that the president has given @entity12 @entity31 ' ample ' time to pass reforms preferred by the president , yet @entity0 declined to bring a version of the @entity65 - passed immigration bill , which includes those changes , to floor			1
and yesterday , @entity68 said , @entity0 refused to put forward a timeline for when @entity70 would pass any sort of immigration legislation at all			2
' so it ’s hard to take seriously this suggestion that @entity31 actually do want to work with the president to pass immigration reform , ' @entity68 said			1
' there is one thing they can do to prevent the president from taking executive action , ' @entity68 said , and that is to ' allow that common sense , bipartisan bill passed by the @entity65 to come to the floor of the @entity86			0
' if the @entity12 passes that @entity65 bill , the president wo n’t take executive action			2
' the @entity28 spokesman said that even if @entity12 @entity31 do not act in the ' best interest in the country , the president ’s not going to miss that opportunity			1
' several hours after the meeting , other attendees of the luncheon with @entity28 had not issued statements with the exception of @entity65 minority whip @entity100 , a @entity101 @entity31			1
remaining silent were @entity103 senator @entity102 , @entity103 senator @entity104 , @entity12 minority leader @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity108 @entity107			2
similarly mum were lower ranking lawmakers in the meeting , @entity113 chairman @entity112 , @entity115 chairwoman @entity114 , @entity117 chairman @entity116 , vice chair of the @entity118 in the @entity65 @entity120 , @entity122 chairwoman @entity121 and @entity119 policy committee chairman @entity119			0
in his statement @entity100 said he , too , ' made clear to the president that we should tackle immigration reform together on a step - by - step basis , beginning with border security and respect for the rule of law			1
' ' unfortunately the president ’s promise to unilaterally go around @entity21 ignores the message voters sent on @entity134 , , ' he said , referring to the @entity31 's victories at the ballot box on tuesday			1
' it is my sincere hope that he will reverse course and work with us – not around us – to secure the border and achieve real reforms to our immigration system			0
' according to the @entity12 the president and @entity44 lawmakers also discussed ' emergency ' @entity149 funding that the president requested from @entity21 this week and the need for the legislative branch to pass a new budget ' in the same bipartisan , drama - free way they did earlier this year			1
' secretary of defense @entity156 , @entity159 director @entity158 and @entity161 head general @entity160 also briefed the group on the fight against @entity164 in @entity165 and @entity166 , the @entity12 aid , and requested an additional $ 5.6 billion from them to support the military mission			0
the @entity170 today announced that it would be sending 1,500 more troops overseas to train @entity165 security forces			0
@entity0 's office said other topics of discussion the ' more than 40 @entity12 - passed jobs bills ' targeted at creating jobs and jump starting the economy and the creation of a new @entity178 ( @entity179 ) for military engagement in @entity165			1
the @entity12 maintains that it does not need new congressional authority to bomb @entity185 militants , arguing that a decade - old @entity179 issued by the legislature in the wake of the @entity165 war is enough , but a bipartisan cadre of representatives has openly disagreed			0
the speaker 's office said @entity0 today ' urged ' the president to send in a new request to satisfy those concerns in a preview of today 's meeting , @entity0 suggested to reporters yesterday that he would confront @entity28 about his ill - advised plans to act on immigration			1
' when you play with matches , you take the risk of burning yourself , ' @entity0 said thursday during a @entity205 press conference			0
' and he 's going to burn himself if he continues to go down this path			0
' the @entity31 leader was responding at the time to @entity28 's commitment on wednesday ' to take whatever lawful actions ' he can to make changes to the deportation process - with or without the permission of @entity21			1
' i 've consistently said that it is my profound preference and interest to see @entity21 act on a comprehensive immigration reform bill , ' @entity28 said during a press conference on wednesday			1
' i think it 's fair to say that i 've shown a lot of patience and tried to work on a bipartisan basis as much as possible and will keep doing so			0
' but in the absence of congressional action , @entity28 again promised to make his own reforms			2
the president has not said what moves he 's considering , but @entity12 officials have indicated that anywhere between one and 11 million illegal immigrants could be allowed to stay in the @entity230 as a direct result			2
challenging @entity0 , @entity28 said on wednesday , ' you send me a bill that i can sign and those executive actions go away			2
' what we ca n't do is just keep on waiting , ' he argued			0
' there 's a cost for waiting			0
' senate minority leader @entity104 , who is slated to become majority leader of the @entity65 in january , said wednesday that @entity28 was taking the wrong approach to altering the nation 's broken immigration system			1
' i think the president choosing to do a lot of things unilaterally on immigration would be a big mistake , ' @entity244 told reporters during a press conference out of @entity252 , where he had just been reelected to his @entity65 seat the night before			0
' it 's an issue that most of my members want to address legislatively and it 's like waving a red flag in front of a bull to say , " if you guys do n't do what i want , i 'm going to do it on my own			0
" ' i hope he wo n't do that because i do think it poisons the well for the opportunity to address a very important domestic issue , ' @entity244 said			0
@entity0 reiterated @entity244 's observation on thursday , saying if @entity28 acts on his own will to ' @entity267 ' for broader reforms to the immigration process ' and there will be no chance for immigration reform moving in this @entity21			1
' the @entity230 people made it clear @entity134 , they want to get things done , and they do n't want the president acting on a unilateral basis , ' @entity0 said			0
the house speaker , who has long said he 's in favor of reforming the immigration system in a step - by - step fashion rather than the president 's preferred comprehensive method , said he was doing his best to come up with a package that all parties involved could agree to			0
' i could regale you with all of my challenges of trying to get members on both sides of the aisle to deal with this			0
but hope springs eternal , ' he said			0
the @entity12 said in a statement after today 's meeting with congressional leaders that he still intends to issue his own set of immigration rules			2
attendees of today 's summit are pictured here from left to right are : @entity12 majority leader @entity106 , @entity12 minority leader @entity105 , house speaker @entity0 , @entity28 , senate majority leader @entity102 , senate minority leader @entity104 and @entity118 sen. @entity120 the @entity31 legislator signaled on thursday that the post-election @entity308 between the @entity12 and @entity70 , at least as far as he is concerned , is already over , just two days after the midterm election that gave his party a historic number of seats in @entity21			1
' my job is not to get along with the president , just to get along with him , although we actually have a nice relationship , ' @entity0 told reporters			0
' my job is to listen to my members and listen to the @entity230 people and make their priorities our priorities			0
' as @entity0 was pledging on @entity44 to stand his ground , @entity12 press secretary @entity68 was assuring reporters at his daily briefing at @entity12 that the president is dedicated to finding ' common ground ' with @entity31 in @entity21			1
the president looks forward to meeting with @entity0 and other congressional leaders for lunch tomorrow at the @entity12 , @entity68 said , suggesting that a new era of bipartisanship could be on the way in @entity205			2
@entity0 seemed suspicious on thursday at his own briefing , across town , that the @entity118 president actually intends to compromise with @entity31			2
' finding common ground is going to be hard work , but it will be even harder if the president is n’t willing to work with us , ' @entity0 said .			1

according to @entity12 speaker @entity0 's office , the @entity31 leader warned that ' unilateral action ' would ' erase any chances ' of immigration reform
it would ' also make it harder for @entity21 and the @entity12 to work together *...* where there might otherwise be common ground '
@entity28 *recommitted* on friday to his plans to take action before the end of the year
