they are the bits of tournament television coverage we love to watch but which we also dread , and in the battle of the @entity6 2014 montages @entity3 just shaded it over @entity8			1
we all enjoy seeing the best bits of a tournament sped up and condensed into just a few minutes but with those montages comes the reality that the greatest football show on earth has come to a close			0
@entity16 2014 will be remembered for the goals , the utter humiliation of the hosts at the hands of @entity21 in the semi-finals , @entity24 's disastrous performance , as well as @entity26 's bite on @entity27			2
although this allowed the @entity3 to include more action , their package also involves a lot of dancing and pieces contributed by actors			0
this adds to the intrigue but it also takes away slightly from the best moments of the tournament - it takes one minute 15 seconds before any goals are shown			0
@entity8 on the other hand just head straight into the action from the off and show all of the goals and tournament best moments one after another			0
they also include some of the funniest studio moments which the @entity3 largely omit from their offering			0
overall , the @entity3 's montage depicts more accurately the story of how the tournament progressed and , although it is a tad long , it just comes out on top			2
the @entity3 also unsurprisingly smashed @entity8 in the @entity6 final viewing figures war			1
a staggering 16.7million people tuned into to watch @entity21 beat @entity73 1 - 0 after extra time on the @entity3 at their peak , whereas just 3.9m opted for @entity8 's coverage from the @entity77			1
@entity78 - bound : @entity80 's @entity79 features during @entity8 's @entity6 best moments montage distraught : @entity73 captain @entity83 cuts a despondent figure during @entity3 's montage salute to a nation : home favourite @entity35 features heavily throughout @entity3 's four - minute 51 - second montage agony : @entity8 capture one of the most iconic moments of the @entity6 when @entity35 fractured his vertebra so near yet so far : @entity73 fans followed their team all the way to the final in @entity16 's backyard penalty drama : another iconic @entity6 moment as substitute goalkeeper @entity98 saves two penalties			1

@entity3 and @entity8 both showed *excellent* montages of the best moments
@entity3 's was four minutes 51 seconds while @entity8 's was two minutes 18 seconds
@entity21 *triumphed* 1 - 0 over @entity73 after extra time in @entity6 final
@entity40 's strike secured @entity21 's fourth @entity6 at the @entity77
@entity3 also smashed @entity8 in ratings war as 16.7million watched @entity3
just 3.9million *spectators* tuned in to watch the @entity6 final on @entity8
