sales of leading brands of extra virgin olive oil have plummeted in the wake of a hefty hike in prices , a new report showed yesterday			1
for the average price of branded olive oil has shot up 16.4 per cent to £ 5.19 a litre over the course of the past year and the increase has taken its toll on sales to supermarket shoppers , according to the latest research			2
while overall sales of extra virgin olive oil have risen 4.7 per cent in volume and 12.5 per cent in value , branded volumes have slumped 11.7 per cent and the 2.8 per cent rise in value is almost entirely attributable to price inflation , data from market analysts @entity25 shows			1
among the best - selling olive oil brands , the worst hit in the last year was @entity26 followed by @entity29 and then @entity30 ( pictured ) trade magazine @entity31 said yesterday : ‘ there is a limit to how much @entity35 will pay for quality and it seems some of @entity38 's biggest extra virgin olive oil brands have hit it			1
the report says that , own label products , on the other hand , have kept a lid on inflation			0
the upshot is that the difference between own label and brands has widened from 19.1 per cent to 28.7 per cent and own - label sales have soared 25.8 per cent in value on volumes up 22.8 per cent			2
among the best - selling olive oil brands , the worst hit in the last year was @entity26 with volume sales down 31.9 per cent followed by @entity29 which was down 28.9 per cent and @entity30 down 7.1 per cent			1
the @entity53 said that reduced deal activity from the brands has not helped but they have lost out to other premium oil brands , notably rapeseed			2
the report says that extra virgin olive oil brands are still reeling from the after - effects of prolonged drought in @entity63 which decimated the country 's 2012/13 olive harvest , slashing production from 1.6 million tonnes in the previous season to just 616,300 tonnes			1
factory gate prices surged by more than 40 per cent in some cases as supplies were squeezed , said @entity71 , managing director of @entity30 @entity38			0
‘ people were scrambling around for oil towards the end of the season and the accessibility of raw materials was very tight , ’ he told the magazine			0
mr @entity71 says he sees no imminent end to the sky - high prices despite the recent @entity63 harvest being up 150 per cent on last year 's to an estimated 1.5 million tonnes			0
he says there is no reason for prices to fall and the industry needs another good year to make up for the shortfall			0
the report says that although cost hikes affect brands and own label alike , until now only the brands have passed on the increases and this has resulted in a significant price discrepancy between branded and own label			0
the @entity53 said : ‘ with raw material costs likely to stay high , how long suppliers will be able to keep a lid on own label extra virgin olive oil costs – up just 2½ per cent in the past year – is now in question			1
and if the difference between own label and branded prices begins to narrow again , brands could claw back some of the lost share over the coming year			0

overall sales of extra virgin olive oil have risen 4.7 per cent in volume and 12.5 per cent in value
branded volumes have slumped 11.7 per cent
