by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 10 august 2013 updated : 16:07 est , 10 august 2013 i am lying on my back in a field amid hundreds of people in stretchy @entity6 clothing at the wanderlust yoga festival in @entity8 – imagine a mini @entity9 , but with added headstands			1
and there are tears streaming down my face			2
the class i ’ve just finished was titled @entity15 : your @entity16			2
but if i was expecting a practical guide to easing physical aches and pains , it ’s evidently aimed more at emotional therapy			2
moments earlier , when the teacher asked us to visualise an area of our life that needed healing , a vivid impression of the ex-boyfriend i had n’t thought about for years appeared in my mind , and with it a profound realisation that i never properly dealt with the fallout from that destructive relationship			2
mind over mats : a mass yoga class at a previous @entity38 - far from the muddy rock events of the @entity40 the waterworks began when we moved into a deeper stretch and it became obvious that getting over it once and for all would mean practising some forgiveness and gratitude – it was time to forgive myself for allowing it to happen , and to thank him for showing me what i did n’t want from a relationship			1
yoga originated in @entity54 , but has become mainstream			1
and much to the distaste of the purists , all sorts of styles of yoga have been developed to suit different bodies and tastes			1
it means there is a class for everyone now			2
i have always approached yoga from a purely athletic standpoint , seeing it mainly as an opportunity for a good stretch			1
but on my mat in @entity8 , i experience a yogic awakening			2
so this is the mind , body and spirit effect that people talk about			0
and judging from the sobs and sniffles on the mats around me , i ’m not the only one			0
the @entity38 ( wander lustfestival.com ) , now in its third year , travels to six different sites in the @entity83 during the summer ( it also went to @entity84 this year ) , and is an example of how mainstream yoga has become in @entity83			1
mind bent : @entity88 has fallen for traditional yoga after attending @entity38 it ’s estimated that 20 million people in the @entity83 now regularly hit the mat , while spending on yoga related products reached £ 17 billion last year – up 87 per cent in five years			1
in the @entity40 , as many as a million people regularly do yoga , and september is @entity98 when more than 2,200 studios will offer a week of free trial classes			1
there are myriad studies to show yoga can help with everything from osteoarthritis and asthma to stress and chronic lower back pain			1
it has also been proven to be useful during pregnancy and labour , and in improving cognitive function and perceived stress during the menopause			0
not to mention the lengthening , tightening effect it has on your body			0
a photographer who specialises in nudes once told me that without doubt , the best bodies she saw naked were the yoga bodies			1
if i was expecting a dreadlocked crowd of blissed - out hippies , the @entity8 event seemed mainly to attract affluent @entity129 decked out in trendy yoga label @entity130 ( which plans to launch in the @entity40 later this year )			1
i even ate lunch next to a couple who had brought a nanny to watch the kids while they took back - to - back classes			0
meanwhile , my lunch might have been a vegan , gluten - free pizza , but evening entertainment also included ‘ @entity145 ’ – a bar serving organic and biodynamic wine – and a lavish , four - course ‘ farm - to - table ’ feast ( with steak and home - made limoncello ) , tickets for which cost $ 85 each and sold out way ahead			0
as for my teary experience on the mat , once the floodgates had opened , i could barely get through a class without crying			0
take the @entity159 session , taught by a woman many regard as the high priestess of yoga , @entity164			1
as she lectured a 400 - strong class of mildly hung - over yogis about how we often use alcohol and other substances as an emotional crutch , it became very clear i do exactly that – and that my love affair with booze began when i needed @entity177 courage to extricate myself from the aforementioned bad romance			0
my favourite kind of yoga has always been @entity182 , the insanely hot class that makes you sweat buckets and gives you muscles like @entity186 , because to me it felt like a ‘ proper ’ workout			1
but after my weekend of healing , i can finally see the point of more gentle , breathing - focused schools of yoga			1
the following weekend , feeling nostalgic for summertime back the @entity40 , my husband and i catch up with friends who regale us with tales of the rock festivals they ’ve been to			0
but i ca n’t stop thinking about a very different kind of festival – and what feels like only the beginning of my yogic journey			1
@entity204 : suitable for all ages and abilities and uses equipment such as foam blocks and straps			0
improves balance and body strength ; a study of 90 people with chronic lower - back pain found less disability , pain and depression after six months			0
ashtanga : fast - moving , demanding yoga comprising six sequences of poses , which become progressively harder – participants advance as their skill develops			1
each pose is linked with one breath			0
said to develop cardiovascular fitness and body strength			1
a small study of children found they lost weight and felt less anxiety after 12 weeks of ashtanga yoga			2
@entity233 : the ‘ yoga of awareness ’ , it combines breathing exercises , postures , chanting mantras and meditation			2
focus on relaxation and self - awareness			0
@entity182 : a class in a sauna - like room where attendees go twice through a series of 26 postures			0
said to burn up to 600 calories a class			0
a 2012 study discovered that bikram was associated with better sleep , while other research found it increased strength and flexibility and decreased weight			0
@entity257 : an umbrella term – @entity257 means a gentle , traditional approach with basic postures , meditation and breathing exercises			0
cuts stress , improves breathing and builds back strength .			0
