@entity0 has seen the first successful flight of a commercial airplane powered by what 's probably the country 's biggest threat to food safety - waste cooking oil			1
the @entity9 - 800 aircraft , operated by @entity10 , flew around 100 passengers from @entity12 to @entity13			1
it meant @entity0 joined a handful of countries in the world that possess the research and development ability to create its own biofuel production technology , according to the @entity20			1
@entity21 : @entity10 flew a @entity9 like this one using a biofuel made from cooking oil but the fact that the new fuel was developed from waste cooking oil - which is in all too plentiful supply in @entity0 , leading to many problems with blocked drains and sewers - has prompted excitement in the country			1
apart from the environmental concerns surrounding the dumping of cooking oil , there is also widespread concern about how much of it ends up on dining tables around the country after unscrupulous dealers remove it from drains and sell it back to retailers			2
the carrier informed all the passengers before departure that the aircraft would use a new type of fuel			0
' the flight was very smooth			0
i did n't experience anything unusual , ' said @entity54 , vice president of @entity10 who was also a passenger on the flight			0
' i hope the biofuel could be promoted throughout the country			0
' ' when i was asked on the phone whether or not i would mind flying with a plane using biofuel , i said of course i would n't			0
i 'd love to be a lab mouse , ' said one passenger named ms @entity64			0
' the successful flight is a landmark and on one hand the low carbon biofuel significantly reduces greenhouse gasses which helps @entity0 realise its 2020 carbon dioxide emissions per gdp by 40 - 50 per cent , ' said @entity72 , spokesman of @entity73			2
' on the other hand , it could help with altering the route of catering waste oil and help stop the danger of it from ending up on the dinner table			0
' food safety : the illegal recycling of waste cooking oil is a constant headache for the @entity0 authorities fly greener : the government is seeking to promote greater environmental sustainability produced by @entity73 , @entity0 's state - owned oil and gas company , this particular biofuel uses restaurant waste cooking oil , often known as the ' gutter oil ' in @entity0 , as the raw material			1
the cooking oil is then blended at a one - to - one ratio with ordinary jet fuel to create the finished product			1
animal fat is the reason why waste cooking oil can be turned into biofuel			1
@entity73 has spent the past five years researching and developing biofuel , according to researcher @entity103 , who also stated that the price of biofuel is two to three times more expensive than normal aviation fuel due to the cost of the raw material			2
apart from animal fat - based biofuel , @entity0 is also developing sugar - based and starch - based biofuels , whose prices are expected to be 15 - 80 per cent of normal aviation fuel			2
waste cooking oil is often collected by underground dealers in @entity0			1
it 's then reprocessed in rudimentary means and will return to millions of dining tables			0
however , many airlines in @entity0 are reluctant to use biofuel due to its high cost , reported @entity20 .			0

@entity10 completed @entity0 's first commercial flight using biofuel
waste cooking oil is used as the raw material to mix with normal jet fuel
the @entity9 *737* - 800 flew around 100 passengers from @entity12 to @entity13
a handful of countries possesses the ability to create its own biofuel
waste oil is major health problem in @entity0 as it is collected from gutters and sold back to restaurants
