early humans first began to master fire around 350,000 years ago , helping to drive the development of complex culture among our ancestors , new archaeological evidence has revealed			1
@entity8 fragments discovered in a cave in the limestone cliffs of @entity11 , close to @entity12 on the @entity14 coast of northern @entity15 , have provided the oldest signs of humans controlling fire			1
the @entity18 is an archaeological site that holds evidence of having being inhabited by humans and their ancestors for around 500,000 years			1
flints found in the @entity18 showed signs of having been blackened and turned red by flames while others showed characteristic round pits where part of the stone had flaked off in the heat in what are called ' pot lids ' by examining flint debris and tools found in the cave , archaeologists found that some of them show discolouration , cracking and small round depressions that are signs of exposure to fire			1
the researchers looked at flints from 100 layers of sediment in the lowermost 16 metres of the cave			0
in those that are older than 350,000 years , none of the flints were found to be burned			2
however , after that there is a sudden explosion in the number of flints that were exposed to fire			2
exactly when humans first began using fire to make their lives easier remains one of the most controversial topics in archaeology			2
the earliest suggested date is around 1.5 million years ago			0
however , some research suggests that our ancestors first began using fire to cook their food as far back as two million years ago			2
cooking meat played a vital role in human evolution , making it easier to digest , reducing the time it took to feed and requiring smaller teeth			1
a study in 2011 by biologists at @entity78 , in @entity75 , @entity74 compared the body patterns , dna and other characteristics of modern humans , non-human primates and 14 extinct hominins			0
they found used the information to look for patterns when eating time began to reduce			0
they calculated that if humans were ordinary primates living off raw food , eating would take up 48 per cent of their day			0
however , modern humans spend just 4.7 per cent of their day to food consumption			0
they suggest that the evolution of smaller teeth in @entity96 around 1.9 million years ago coincided with a change in diet that may have been driven by the cooking of food			2
given that wildfires rarely spread into caves due to the lack of vegetation , the scientists believe these flints were burned in the fires built within the cave by prehistoric humans			2
the discovery means our human ancestors in this area of @entity15 mastered control of fire nearly 50,000 years before other widely accepted evidence found to support the regular human use of fire			1
it could bring new understanding to the development of culture and human behaviour			1
while 350,000 years ago , the lower @entity125 period , is too late for fire to have played a role in the development of human 's big brains as some scientists have suggested , it would have played a key role in the origins of social behaviour , argue the scientists behind the latest study			1
it has also been suggested that control of fire was one of the key developments that allowed early humans to spread into colder climates , but this expansion had already begun by 350,000 years ago			1
dr @entity142 , an archaeologist at the @entity143 who led the new study , said : ' understanding the time frame of this " technological mutation " will help explain aspects of our anatomical evolution and encephalization over the last million years			2
' it will also provide an important perspective on hominin dispersals out of @entity154 and the colonization of temperate environments , as well as the origins of social developments such as the formation of provisioned base camps			0
' early humans are widely accepted to have gained complete widespread control of fire by around 125,000 years ago with the ability to kindle and light fires themselves			1
however , the time when human ancestors first gained this essential technological ability has been highly controversial			0
@entity18 at @entity11 in northern @entity15 holds evidence of early humans from up to 500,000 years ago the @entity18 was discovered in the limestone cliffs of @entity11 around 14 miles south of @entity12 , @entity15 some anthropologists claim that early humans , such @entity172 , began exploiting fire as long as 1.5 million years ago while still in @entity154			1
however , much of this evidence - which consists of heated clays and charcoal fragments - is disputed and could have occurred as a result of natural bush fires			2
there are some who believe that fire played an instrumental role in the evolution of early hominins around two million years ago when our teeth and guts became smaller			2
they have also argued that fire played a key role in the evolution of larger human brains			1
however , many experts believe that early uses of fire may well have been opportunistic where early humans used natural bush fires rather than lighting fires themselves			0
the artifacts found at these sites often show few signs of burning , suggesting fire was not used regularly , according to dr @entity142 and his colleagues , whose research is published in the @entity201			0
they say their findings at @entity18 are supported by evidence from other recent discoveries			1
@entity207 flints , bones and ash found in the @entity210 in @entity211 , @entity15 , point towards the use of a hearth in this cave that has been dated to around 300,000 years ago			1
dr @entity142 , along with other researchers from the @entity143 and the @entity217 , said : ' while the earliest evidence of fire associated with hominin activities is much older , the data presented here indicate that fire became a regular and constant part of hominin behavioral adaptations in @entity227 only after 350,000 years ago			1
' the benefits of fire for processing food , altering raw materials or enhancing social interactions would be fully realized only when use of fire shifted from opportunistic and occasional to habitual and regular			0
thousands of flints fragments with signs of exposure to heat and fire have been discovered in the @entity18			1
they begin appearing in the lower @entity239 period around 350,000 years ago but none are seen before then ' regular use of fire changed hominin existence and influenced the direction of evolution in our lineage in a diversity of ways			2
' to the extent that humans ' physical , cognitive and social evolution was affected by the emergence of habitual fire use , we should be able to trace evidence for such impacts most clearly in the hominins that inhabited the landscape over the last 350,000 years ago			1
' @entity18 has proved to be a rich site for archaeological evidence and is thought to have been inhabited intermittently through the @entity262 and @entity263 ages between 500,000 and 40,000 yaers ago			1
around 82 feet of sand , silt and clay have built up in the cave , allowing archaeologists to date the signs of human habitation left in each layer			0
among the remains found there were the skull fragments and bones from a female @entity277 , that is thought to be around 120,000 years old			0
large numbers of deer bones have also been found there , which has led to suggests that is served as a place where animals were trapped and then butchered by humans			0
hundreds of flint tools , used to scrape and cut , have also been discovered together with thousands of fragments that have broken off as tools were shaped			0
flint handaxes are among the stone tools to have been discovered in sediment layers in @entity18 in @entity15 however , dr @entity142 said it was still unclear how the fires were started in the cave and may have been either by sparking kindling or keeping fire alight from natural bush fires			1
he said : ' the changes in burning frequency at @entity18 and @entity210 not only signal the point in time where the use of fire became habitual , but also indicate that humans had mastered the art of kindling fire			1
' unfortunately there are no means currently available to directly determine how ancient fires were started , so the latter remains simply a hypothesis for the time being			0
' dr @entity314 , an athropologist at @entity315 , said the latest findings in @entity15 were ' exciting '			0
he said : ' while we have evidence of fire use going back to almost 1 million years , it only appears irregularly and does not seem to have be a widespread behaviour - perhaps just being used by one or two bright sparks			1
' crucially this paper shows that by at least 350,000 years ago fire was being regularly used as a tool by our ancestors			0
' having the ability to make and control fire , along with projectile weapons and stone tools , further cemented our position as an apex predator of the @entity332			2
' fire use is one of the most important developments in human evolution but also very difficult to recognise in the archaeological record			1
' @entity207 material could have been from intentional campfires or from natural events such as bush fires			0
' @entity342 allows food to be cooked which increases the calories in the diet while reducing the amount of energy our ancestors needed to use collecting it			0
but fire was also an important social tool			0
' the heat allowed expansion into cold areas and the light extended the day and offered protection from predators			0
' the attraction of an open fire is an old and primordial one for humans and here we can see the origins of that fascination			0

burnt flints from @entity18 in northern @entity15 may help to *rewrite* history of human evolution and development of culture
control of fire is too recent to explain the evolution of humans ' big brains
but it would have shaped the development of human culture and behaviour
fire use seems to have occurred after humans expanded into cold climates
evidence is thought to be 50,000 years older than any *previously* finds
