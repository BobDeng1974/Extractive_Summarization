@entity0 scored three goals at the @entity2 during a successful loan last season that helped @entity5 reach @entity6			1
he claimed another here of an entirely different complexion			2
the 21 - year - old striker , borrowed from @entity10 , delivered the cutting edge to send @entity12 five points clear of their promotion rivals			1
having taken stick all game from @entity5 fans who once cheered him , he revelled in celebrating his defining contribution			1
@entity0 celebrates as the @entity10 loanee strikes to earn @entity12 all three points in the 64th minute the hosts were caught attempting to play the ball out from the back			1
@entity25 nicked possession and threaded a pass to send @entity28 clear			0
he stretched to reach it before @entity30 and looked like he may go over when the @entity5 goalkeeper spread himself			1
instead he kept his feet and his head , slotting a neat finish from a tight angle			0
his 16th goal of the season			0
quite a way to end @entity39			0
@entity40 celebrates with @entity0 as the away side secure all three points against @entity5 this result will hurt @entity44 as much as it satisfies @entity45			1
aiming for automatic promotion , @entity5 are faltering			1
the roar from the visiting section at the final whistle told a story			0
so did the solemnness with which @entity5 fans vacated their seats			1
they look set for the play - offs again at this rate			2
the visitors so nearly took the lead in spectacular style five minutes before the interval			0
@entity30 raced out of his area to intercept a long punt forward but only succeeded in sending his weak clearance to the boot of @entity65			0
@entity5 's free fall @entity67 of @entity5 and @entity68 compete for the ball during the @entity71 match from 40 yards out the @entity72 controlled in an instant and lofted the ball high towards the goal			1
the capacity home crowd seemed to hold its breath as the shot hung in the air , only letting go when the ball dropped to bounce back off the post and into @entity30 ’s arms			0
it was not a first half to savour for either of these teams with @entity88 aspirations			2
beginning the match two points apart in fourth and third , @entity5 and @entity12 both played as if anxious to avoid defeat rather than seize victory			1
quality was low , the ball often sent to the skies			0
@entity98 of @entity5 and @entity99 of @entity12 both do their best to win the ball @entity5 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity30 6 ; @entity101 6 ( @entity102 ’ 5 ) , @entity103 6.5 , @entity104 5.5 , @entity105 6 ; @entity67 6.5 , @entity106 6 ( @entity107 70 ’ 5 ) , @entity108 6.5 ; @entity109 6.5 , @entity98 6 , @entity110 6 ( @entity111 70 ’ 5 ) booked : @entity101 , @entity67 , @entity108 subs not used : @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 manager : @entity44 6 @entity12 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity118 6 ; @entity119 6 , @entity120 6.5 , @entity99 6.5 , friend 5.5 ; @entity68 6.5 , @entity121 6 ; @entity122 6.5 ( @entity123 90 ’ ) , @entity65 6.5 ( @entity124 81 ’ ) , @entity25 6.5 ( reach 86 ’ ) , @entity28 7 booked : @entity65 , @entity125 subs not used : @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 manager : @entity45 7 referee : @entity133 6 @entity134 : @entity0 the double absence of @entity136 and @entity137 clipped @entity5 of their attacking focus in the previous three games leading to defeat and two draws			1
@entity98 made a fist of playing the striker ’s role again but as a natural winger he does not possess the hold up ability of @entity136 or predatory instinct on @entity137			0
@entity12 ’s form entering this match was quite literally hit and miss : win followed loss in their past six games			1
they have struggled away from the @entity154 before this			0
@entity5 held greater possession but did not create a much			1
their best opening of the first half came in the 15th minute when @entity109 whipped a cross to the back post to @entity110 , who was unable to apply the killer touch from two yards			2
@entity12 went straight down the other end with @entity28 slipping in @entity163 to strike for goal			2
@entity30 beat away that effort and then did well to save @entity0 ’s follow - up too			1
five minutes after the break simmering tensions sparked into a mass melee when @entity106 left @entity121 on the floor with a tackle			0
when referee @entity133 blew for a stoppage , @entity65 squared up to @entity106 , prompting a dozen or so to get involved			0
@entity65 and @entity174 were booked for their parts			0
@entity0 had a chance to score before he did , miscuing badly from @entity122 ’s cross			2
but the mark of a good striker is showing confidence the next time			2
@entity68 beats his man to the ball as @entity12 secure all three points away against @entity5 after his goal @entity44 made three changes seeking to salvage something			1
@entity111 came on and had @entity5 ’s best chance , but dragged wide when the ball fell his way in the box			2
in injury time @entity0 could have doubled his tally , finding himself with a clear run at goal as @entity5 poured forwards			1
but as he closed in on @entity30 , @entity103 arrived to block his shot wide			0
no matter , he was still the match winner .			0

@entity0 struck in the second - half to earn @entity12 the win
@entity10 loanee scored in the 64th minute to secure all three points
win boosts @entity71 's side chances of reaching the big time
@entity5 now without a @entity71 win in their last five matches
