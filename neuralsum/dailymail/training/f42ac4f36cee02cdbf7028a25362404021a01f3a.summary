by @entity0 @entity1 suffers from a condition which means she can not raise a full smile or even blink on the right side a woman struck by a syndrome that deformed her face has now been the victim of botched surgery - which means she will never smile again			1
@entity1 , 32 , was just 14 when her face became paralysed , meaning she can not raise a full smile or even blink on the right side			1
the mother - of - two suffers from a condition called cholesteatoma - an abnormal collection of skin cells inside the ear which apart from hearing loss , can also lead to facial nerve damage resulting in a weakness to half the face			1
for half her life , ms @entity1 , from @entity22 , avoided looking in mirrors because she was ‘ too repulsed ’ by her own reflection			1
in total , she has had 16 operations for her condition			1
in 2007 , the mother - of - two had an operation at the @entity30 in @entity22 , using muscle taken from her left thigh and put into her cheek			1
the operation was a success and she regained control and movement in her face , allowing her to smile again - and for two years she lived a ‘ happy ’ life			1
but when an infection meant her face would need to be operated on again , the outcome left her devastated			1
surgeons at the @entity42 interfered with the muscle holding the sling to correct her smile - which caused it to disappear			2
ms @entity1 later discovered that her operation notes from 2007 were not requested from the hospital who had corrected her smile and restored her confidence			1
she was awarded a substantial sum in compensation from @entity53 after they admitted clinical negligence			0
ms @entity1 , who works as a @entity56 , said : ' it was the worst point in my entire life when i saw what they had done - my face was ruined			1
' they had completely destroyed my chances of smiling again			0
i physically hated the way my face looked and just wanted to shut the entire world out			2
' what was hardest was that for two years i had finally been happy with the way i looked			2
' i could go out with my friends and actually be happy and feel comfortable with my face			2
' after the surgery i could n’t bear to look at myself again and it was the lowest i had ever felt			2
the two hospitals that did the operations just had n’t communicated with each other at all			0
' if they had read the notes sent over to them they would have known not to remove the muscle and my face would still be fine			0
' i ’ve had 16 operations in total including having a scar created to look like a laughing line on my right hand side			1
but i ’m not having any more now - i ’m done			0
' ms @entity1 aged 8 ( left ) and 13 ( right )			2
she was just 14 when her face became paralysed in total , she has endured 16 operations to relieve her condition - but botched surgery means she is still unhappy with her appearance ms @entity1 was just 14 when she began experiencing problems			1
friends spotted her drooping face at school after a @entity95 lesson and a @entity96 confirmed she had @entity97 - a form of facial paralysis - but claimed she should recover in two to three months			1
but with no signs of improvement , she was sent for @entity103 scans which concluded she in fact had cholesteatoma			0
and when she returned to school , she was bullied by her classmates who teased her about her skewed appearance and mocked her by saying she looked like she ’d had a stroke			0
in the years that followed , she became a recluse who was too embarrassed to go out in fear of seeing her reflection in shop windows			0
people would tell her to ‘ cheer up ’ and she took to covering her face with her hands			0
she added : ' i found it really hard to meet new people , and would always angle my face away from them so they could only see my left side			2
' i would never eat out at restaurants because i ’m not able to chew my food properly because of the paralysis			0
“ the worst thing about it is when i ’ve put it to the back of my mind and do n’t think about it			0
ms @entity134 with her children , @entity136 and @entity137			0
she said she avoided looking in mirrors for half of her life because she was ' too repulsed ' by her own reflection ms @entity1 with her daughter @entity137			2
she said it is only in the last six months that she has got her confidence back since the botched operation ' then i hear someone saying , " what ’s wrong with her face " , or , " why does she look like that " ? then it all comes flooding back to me			0
' despite her struggle , ms @entity1 , a single mother of two girls - @entity136 , six and @entity137 , 11 - has only recently been able to come to terms with her appearance			1
she said : ' it ’s only in the last six months that i have got my confidence back since the operation			0
' i ’ve started to go to a charity called @entity161 which if i ’d been aware of when my facial palsy started , things could have been very different			0
' i had been searching for 18 years for someone to talk to and eventually i am now learning to be happy with how i look			0
' @entity165 , medical director at @entity166 , said : ' after suffering from facial palsy , ms @entity1 had a successful operation at @entity53 which restored some of her facial movements , including the ability to smile			1
' we are therefore extremely sorry that a further procedure some years later to prevent a potential serious infection from occurring meant that some benefits of the previous procedure were lost			0
' we can only imagine how devastating this must be for her and her family and a full review of miss @entity1 ’s care has been undertaken as a consequence , and we would like to offer our apologies for this			1

@entity1 , 32 , was just 14 when her face became paralysed
suffers from cholesteatoma , which can lead to facial nerve damage
can not raise a full smile or even blink on right side - even after 16 operations
in 2007 had successful surgery which allowed her to finally smile
but further surgery for an infection undid all the work , ruining her smile
