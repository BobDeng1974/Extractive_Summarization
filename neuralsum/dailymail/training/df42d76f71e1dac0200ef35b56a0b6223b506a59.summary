@entity0 came close to ending their interminable wait for a first victory over the mighty @entity4 with a stirring performance at @entity6			1
but , once again , the cold fact is they failed to exploit a @entity4 off - day and lost			1
the tourists were a pale shadow of the @entity12 winners , unsurprisingly after coach @entity13 made 13 changes to the side who beat @entity17 last week			0
combinations lacked rhythm , balls were frequently lost from hand and in contact , and twin legends @entity23 and @entity25 coughed up a bizarre amount of possession between them in the first half			0
videos scroll down to watch post-match reaction from both nations all blacks no 8 @entity32 busts through the @entity0 defence and towards the try line despite a spirited chase and attempt to pull him up short @entity32 gets his left arm free to score the opening try of the match @entity0 : @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 ( c ) ; @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55			1

their back row of @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity55 , @entity23 and @entity52 impressed , as did fly - half @entity46 , until his injury - enforced replacement			0
however , crucially , for all the unstinting effort and ambition they showed , the @entity113 also lacked the cohesion to turn possession into the necessary points			0
after a towering display in the win over @entity122 , captain @entity47 was left wondering ‘ what if ’ as he sent a penalty wide with just 10 minutes remaining that would have put @entity0 18 - 17 ahead			1
@entity4 were rattled but , minutes later , they responded quickly with a try from lock @entity76 to seal their victory			1
the game started at a furious pace			0
@entity131 continued where he left off last week with accurate line - outs and @entity52 ’s varying of the receiver perplexed the @entity4			1
but , typical of the nature of the game , a big tackle by @entity46 and @entity53 on @entity4 debutant @entity138 lifted the crowd and led to a turnover and break by @entity51 — but he was penalised in the ensuing ruck , only for @entity25 miss the target with his first penalty			2
@entity0 's @entity144 dives over for their opening try at @entity6 @entity0 's @entity55 ( left and @entity52 ( right ) celebrate @entity45 's try @entity4 did score first , though , when no 8 @entity32 opened up @entity0 ’s defence by skipping out of @entity44 ’s tackle and punishing @entity41 for going high by touching down			1
however , within three minutes of that try , @entity144 intercepted a @entity23 pass to @entity32 and sped away for @entity0 ’s first score			1
@entity47 converted to put the @entity113 7 - 5 ahead			0
@entity0 then lost @entity43 to a hamstring injury and prop @entity50 , in bristling form , followed			2
@entity144 almost snatched another intercept before @entity25 goaled his first kick before making it two after the half - hour			2
with @entity46 varying @entity0 ’s attack well , the @entity157 towering over @entity76 and @entity23 in the line - out and @entity64 , @entity43 ’s replacement , in fine form , the home team had plentiful ball			1
@entity47 converted a penalty but @entity25 replied to send the @entity4 in at the interval 14 - 10 up			2
a backlash was expected from the tourists in the second half , but it was @entity0 who started strongly with a fine attack from @entity41 , @entity64 and @entity45			2
the move was taken on by @entity173 , which brought a penalty			0
@entity47 was successful with his kick to bring @entity0 back to within a point of the @entity4 five minutes into the second half			1
all black @entity67 ( right ) flies highest after a bomb while @entity63 contests the ball for @entity0 @entity76 crosses for a late try that saw the @entity4 ' slender one - point lead stretch to eight after @entity68 's conversion man of the match @entity76 celebrates his 74th - minute try @entity186 referee @entity185 then penalised a squint feed at the scrum by @entity47 , infuriating the crowd as he had paid no attention to similar feeds from both sides in the first half , but still @entity0 could not retain ball long enough to develop a consistency in attack			1
all @entity4 coach @entity13 began to off - load his experienced bench with four replacements in five minutes			2
they included @entity87 for the subdued @entity201 and @entity88 for @entity25 , with @entity68 shifting to his accustomed stand - off berth			0
their experience was obvious as blocking moves started to appear in their attack			0
subtle , but illegal work in the maul and breakdown , raised the ire of @entity113			0
but @entity0 were not done			2
a fine tackle and turnover by @entity64 set the attack on the front foot , @entity51 steaming up the field and @entity61 showing stirring intent with a break minutes after replacing @entity55			0
however , @entity4 were intent on keeping @entity0 penned deep in their own half and with ferocious defending — much of it from offside positions which @entity185 and his assistants seemed unable to see — the @entity113 could not escape			1
@entity0 stand arm in arms as the @entity4 deliver one of their intimidating hakas the clock ticked past the hour mark with the score still 14 - 13 to @entity4 , and the pre-match optimism among @entity0 fans was taking on a new tangible quality			1
@entity68 converted a penalty in the 65th minute to nudge the @entity4 into a four - point lead , but @entity47 responded in kind from a ruck penalty won by @entity59			2
and then @entity0 had the chance to take the lead			2
after a superb line - out take by the impressive @entity53 and a fine run by @entity64 , @entity185 finally penalised @entity4 for offside			0
but @entity47 struck his kick just wide of the upright from 15 metres in from the left touch			0
the game entered the final 10 minutes with the @entity6 crowd roaring			0
but there seemed to be a hesitancy from the @entity113 , perhaps struggling to believe the chance to strike a historic first win over @entity4 was in their hands			0
a slick pass from @entity79 to @entity76 sent the lock diving over , @entity68 converting to open up an eight - point , and winning lead .			1
