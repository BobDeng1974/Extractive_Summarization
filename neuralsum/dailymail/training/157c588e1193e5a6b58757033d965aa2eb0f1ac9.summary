by @entity0 you wait years for a decent sighting of the legendary ape - like creature known as @entity4 , and then two come along at once			1
the fascinating photographs , taken just two weeks ago near @entity6 , @entity7 , appear to show a pair of @entity9 , or perhaps that should be @entity11 , wandering through the trees			0
keen hiker @entity13 claims he spotted the seven - foot - tall beasts just yards from a main road through trees in @entity17			0
two beasts : @entity13 claimed this image , taken just two weeks ago near @entity6 , @entity7 , showed two of the mysterious creatures known as @entity4 wandering through the woods is it @entity4 ? @entity13 's close up photo , pictured , apparently shows one of the ' beasts ' spotted just yards from a main road through trees in @entity17 lurking : the photographs were taken by keen hiker @entity13 who was on his way home with his girlfriend from a festival with his girlfriend when the pair spotted the mysterious shape moving in the forest mr @entity13 , 57 , had been returning from the @entity37 with his girlfriend when the pair saw the mysterious shape moving in the forest			1
he quickly grabbed his camera and fired off these shots as they slowed the car down and edged along the road			0
traffic backing - up behind his vehicle forced @entity13 to move on but not before he got what he believes is some of the best evidence yet of the existence of the legendary @entity49 creature			2
debate : @entity13 's photographs fueled the debate on whether the legendary creature actually exists mr @entity13 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , said : ' i 'm a sceptic myself , i 'm not a believer , but this was not a bear and you can see fur on it			1
' it 's wider at the shoulders and tapers down whereas a bear is bigger in the middle and stands differently with its paws out , this was standing like a man , like a @entity4			1
' at first some people have discredited it and said it 's just a root ball at the bottom of a fallen tree , but i 've been back to the exact spot and there is no root ball there			1
' we do have black bears , but they are considerably smaller than this , it was standing about seven - foot tall			0
' the day before the sighting @entity13 said there had been a ' @entity4 calling contest ' organised as part of the bridge festival - an event held annually in the area to commemorate an old viaduct destroyed by a tornado			2
he said : " this was 200 yards from the road , it was too narrow for me to be able to pull over without stopping traffic but i got as many pictures as i could			0
' i actually dropped the camera casing so i could n't see what i had got until i got home and put them on my computer , i was surprised at what i saw			0
' i looks more like a bigfoot than anything else , i 've already had organisations asking me to send them copies for verification			0
' mr @entity13 - who is a member of the local outdoor pursuits group @entity108 - said he had never seen anything like it in the woods before			2
location : outdoorsman @entity13 , pictured , said he was previously a skeptic but the strange ' creature ' convinced him the quiet spot where the two ' bigfoots ' were seen			2
photographer @entity13 fired off several shots			0
he said he was ' surprised ' when he arrived home and saw the pictures close up he said : ' this area is known for @entity4 sightings but this is the first time i have seen anything like this , i am in the woods every week , i hunt and go hiking			1
' i went back to the exact spot where it had been and there was nothing there , just years and years of leaves on the floor			1
' it comes as researchers told a new conference in @entity137 that they have proof big foot is real and have even collected dna samples			1
the @entity140 has spent $ 500,000 on collecting data and evidence over the past five years			0
@entity4 , also known as sasquatch , is the name given to an ape - like creature that some people believe inhabits forests , mainly in the @entity148 of @entity49			1
@entity4 is usually described as a large , hairy , bipedal humanoid			2
in 1951 @entity49 @entity150 photographed what he described as a @entity153 footprint beginning a spate of ' sightings ' and print finds throughout the 20th and 21st century .			0

@entity158 spots what appears to be two creatures lurking in the woods
he said creature was bigger than a bear with a different body shape
but when he returned to the exact spot there was no sign of them
it comes as researchers say they have @entity177 proof @entity4 is real
