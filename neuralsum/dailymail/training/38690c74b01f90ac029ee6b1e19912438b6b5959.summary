by @entity0 published : 07:11 est , 19 october 2013 updated : 07:11 est , 19 october 2013 faith schools could be banned from teaching their own denomination if proposals to add @entity4 to the national curriculum go ahead faith schools could lose the right to teach their own belief and instead have to give more weight to other religions			1
a report by the @entity12 for @entity13 and @entity14 says @entity4 has become marginalised and should be added to the national curriculum			1
but that would make it a legal requirement for all school to teach the same syllabus , regardless of their faiths			0
the report , a three year review of religious teaching in schools , could form the basis of a new curriculum when it is released next week			1
chairman @entity29 has admitted that it would be difficult for faith schools to teach their own denomination , but said one solution could involve optional modules for students			1
speaking to @entity35 , he said : ' these are quite important and difficult issues to overcome			0
i do n't personally think they are insuperable			0
' i think you could get sufficient agreement on a national body of religious education knowledge and skills and understanding that everyone should know for the modern world			0
' since 1944 @entity4 has been given a special status as a compulsory subject but which has no specified content			1
instead the subject matter is agreed by a committee of faith leaders , teachers and politicians agree the topics covered in each area			2
@entity56 , secretary of state for education , is criticised in a report on religious education for scrapping bursaries for trainee teachers and not putting re on the @entity62 faith schools make separate arrangements through their diocese while academies can also decide their own content			1
the report will also accuse @entity69 of damaging re by scrapping bursaries for trainee teachers , refusing to add the subject to the @entity62 and rejecting calls to update teaching materials			0
an @entity76 report said earlier this month also said more than half of @entity13 's schools were failing pupils on religious education			0
the report says there is a lack of focus on the subject and that six out of ten schools are not realising the subject 's full potential in lessons , highlighting low standards , weak teaching and confusion about the purpose of the course			2
the re council also had to raise Â£ 100,000 to fund its own curriculum guidance after the government turn down its bid for funding			0
a @entity101 spokesperson said : ' religious education remains a compulsory part of the school curriculum and the numbers studying the full course gcse and a levels in the subject has increased in the past year			2

report says @entity4 should be added to national curriculum
*fears* that subject has been marginalised and is being badly taught
faith schools would be legally required to teach standard syllabus
currently @entity4 is a compulsory subject but with no agreed content
