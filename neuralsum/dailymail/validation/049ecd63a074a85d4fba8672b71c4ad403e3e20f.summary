a cloud of toxic smog blown across the channel from @entity3 has sent pollution levels in the @entity5 soaring to dangerous levels and will continue plaguing the country into tomorrow			1
high pressure and little wind means the pollution is building up , and also means that the blanket of cloud which is currently covering much of the country will persist into friday , blocking out the eclipse for most people			1
a @entity17 spokesman said for most sky - gazers the only sign the eclipse is happening will be when light levels dip at around 9.30am			1
she added that there will be pockets of clear skies , but that it is difficult to predict where these will be			0
meanwhile the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) is advising the elderly , young and those with heart and lung conditions to avoid strenuous activity , especially outdoors , adding that those with asthma may also experience increased breathing problems			0
a @entity26 spokesman said : ' adults and children with heart or lung problems are at greater risk of symptoms			0
follow your doctor 's usual advice about exercising and managing your condition			0
' it is possible that very sensitive individuals may experience health effects even on low air pollution days			2
' a @entity17 spokesman added : ' some individuals , such as those with existing heart or lung conditions , may experience increased symptoms			0
' @entity17 is working very closely with @entity26 and @entity92 ( @entity92 ) to ensure they have the most up - to - date and accurate air quality forecasts in order to provide relevant advice to the public			0
' @entity97 , chief executive of asthma @entity5 , says : ' two thirds of people with asthma find that air pollution makes their asthma worse , putting them at an increased risk of a potentially fatal asthma attack			1
' when air pollution is high it ’s vital people with respiratory conditions including asthma check air pollution forecasts , carry their reliever inhaler with them at all times , and ensure that they are taking their preventer inhaler every day because this will help build resilience to asthma triggers like air pollution			1
' people with asthma have told us that on days when air pollution levels are high they feel that they ca n’t even leave the house for fear that it will trigger an attack			1
' @entity67 was badly affected by smog in april last year when high pollution levels from @entity3 combined with toxic particles from the @entity5 and dust blown in from the @entity127 to create a thick cloud that was visible across parts of the capital			1
@entity62 is currently shrouded in a thick layer of smog , and pollutants blown over from the continent have been causing problems in the @entity5 last year authorities in @entity62 took the unprecedented step of banning cars from the road for a day in order to cut pollution levels settled weather conditions have allowed pollution levels to rocket , exceeding @entity145 recommended limits by up to three times in some places ( pictured , the @entity141 is seen among the smog ) an unusual combination of factors had conspired " to create a ' perfect storm ' for air pollution , ' according to @entity153 , a meteorologist at the @entity154			1
' toxic gases , such as nitrogen dioxide and ozone , as well as fine dust particles in the air blown in from the @entity127 and from burning fossil fuels , all contribute to cause problems for people with heart , lung and breathing problems , such as asthma , ' she said			2
around the same time @entity62 took the unprecedented step of banning cars from the roads for a day in an effort to ease pollutant levels , which had reached dangerous levels			2
for the rest of this week the weather is set to stay mild , dry and predominantly cloudy for most of the @entity5 over the next couple of days and into the weekend , as an area of high pressure persists			1
@entity178 , a spokesman for the @entity17 , said : ' tomorrow is going to be similar to today with more cloud around , particularly for the @entity180			2
there is a chance of showers in the @entity184 and just a risk of some more showers later on for @entity71			0
@entity67 was badly affected by a ' perfect storm ' of smog last year as local pollution , toxic particles from @entity3 and dust blown across from the @entity127 combined to create dangerous conditions @entity193 can just be made out amid a pall of smog that covered @entity67 in april last year leading to @entity26 putting out health warnings ' there is going to be a weather front pushing in to the @entity198 and areas of @entity71 which may clear a little of the cloud			1
elsewhere it will continue to be cloudy			0
if you catch a break in the cloud , like today , you will see some sunshine			2
' it will be cloudy throughout friday with a chance of some breaks , though it is too early to say exactly where they might be			0
' saturday there will still be cloud around with temperatures dropping because we have got air moving in from the @entity180 , bringing them down to a little below average			0
it will be much the same on sunday			0

pollution covering @entity62 has been blown across channel and weak winds mean it has settled across the @entity5
it will remain for much of tomorrow before new weather front will cause it to dissipate by friday morning
however cloud will still blanket the country on friday , meaning most people will miss the eclipse at 9.30am
