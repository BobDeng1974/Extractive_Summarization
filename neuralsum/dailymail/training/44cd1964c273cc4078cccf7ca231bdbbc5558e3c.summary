1 @entity0 , @entity1 1:40.480 2 @entity2 , @entity1 +0.386 3 @entity3 , @entity4 +0.545 a warning sign flashed in front of @entity2 here in the desert night as @entity0 took pole position for the race that will determine the destiny of the world title on sunday			1
it is the @entity14 ’s 11th pole of the season and the most important , coming ahead of an @entity16 that will be fought as much in the head as on the baking track of @entity20			1
they were jigging in the @entity1 garage – @entity0 ’s wife @entity23 and the @entity1 ’ hierarchy – as he beat @entity2			1
@entity0 put up his thumb and thrust his forearm out as he came back into the pit lane			2
it was a gesture of intent			0
@entity0 will start sunday 's @entity16 from pole position ahead of his @entity1 team - mate @entity2 it marked the @entity14 ’s 11th pole of the season and the most important , coming ahead of the @entity36 race which will determine the title @entity0 , 17 points adrift of @entity39 , celebrates in front of the camera after the qualifying session in @entity36 on saturday evening @entity0 ’s lap was faster by 0.386sec , with @entity2 ’s final flying lap off the pace from the first sector			1
however , @entity2 need only finish second to win his second title on sunday regardless of whether @entity0 wins the race			1
that is the cushion of the @entity51 ’s 17 - point lead going into the weekend			0
the random factors are the @entity4 cars			2
@entity3 was third and @entity55 fourth			1
‘ it is only one small step , ’ said @entity0 , ‘ because it is about the championship , not pole position			1
it would have been great if a @entity4 got between the two of us			2
perhaps that can happen tomorrow			0
’ @entity2 ’s voice was deeper			2
‘ i enjoyed qualifying but as @entity0 said tomorrow is the special day			2
’ there had been a few lively moments earlier in the session			0
@entity2 locked up in the first session and @entity0 , more dramatically , ran wide in the second			1
then @entity2 was far on to the kerbs in his first fast lap in the third			1
before the action started , came the phoney war			0
the @entity14 newspaper @entity77 reported that @entity2 fans were making noise in the yachts in @entity20 to disturb @entity0 , whose rest room is @entity82 ’s room is next door so i ’m not sure it ’s a fool - proof plan of disturbance			1
despite being slower than @entity2 in the opening two sessions , @entity0 ( pictured ) made it count when it mattered in @entity36 @entity2 locks eyes with @entity3 , who starts third , as he shares a rather awkward congratulatory handshake with pole - sitter @entity0 @entity94 supremo @entity93 shares a cuddle with the @entity97 driver in the build - up to saturday 's qualifying session @entity103 , in what might be the last @entity94 qualifying session of his life , will start eighth , but only after he needed to go back to the pits because @entity105 had forgotten to fuel him			1
‘ are you joking , ’ he said			0
he still beat his rival for a seat at the team next year , @entity110 , who will start 11th			2
@entity103 stands 10 - 9 in qualifying performances this season			2
will that register on the radar of @entity115 , who was watching here from the pit wall ? among the first to fall by the harbour side were the @entity119 of @entity120 and @entity97 rookie @entity121			0
just making it here was a triumph of sorts for @entity124 , whose affairs are being overseen by a pint - sized @entity126 called @entity127 , the administrator and ballroom dance devotee			0
he finds himself on the pit wall			0
he will not get the call to lead @entity132 , of course			0
they are expected to dispense with team principal @entity134 to be replaced by @entity136 vice-president @entity135			0
there is also a suggestion that @entity139 will emerge from his ‘ retirement ’ to rejoin the team with which he enjoyed so much success as an architect of the @entity145 era			0
he denied it in a text to @entity148 of @entity149			0
@entity103 , who could be competing at his final grand prix weekend , will start from eighth position in @entity36 @entity0 must surely win on sunday and he has given himself every hope after securing pole position with a blistering lap on saturday @entity4 watched the qualifying action unfold with former @entity157 @entity156 in the @entity159 garage @entity36 will stage this year 's season finale which is finely poised after saturday 's dramatic qualifying session			1

@entity0 *clinched* his 11th pole of the season with an *impeccable* lap under the lights at the @entity20
the @entity14 was almost four tenths quicker than @entity2 , whose laps were *littered* with *mistakes*
@entity2 however , only needs to finish 2nd to become first @entity97 *double* @entity172 since *sir* @entity174
the @entity4 *duo* of @entity3 and @entity55 will start behind the @entity1 pair with @entity103 8th
