@entity0 turns to his young son @entity1 and cracks a joke that only the @entity5 - speaking members of his entourage and our interpreter can appreciate at first			1
so just how angry was @entity10 after @entity13 ’s shocking @entity12 defeat at home to @entity15 in midweek ? ‘ even little @entity1 was angry , ’ says @entity0 , turning to the five - year - old who sits adoringly by his side			1
‘ and he told me i dived to try and win a penalty ! ’ @entity0 continued his rich vein of form by scoring the winner in @entity23 but the striker could not prevent @entity13 slipping to @entity12 defeat in midweek it is less than 24 hours after @entity13 ’s flagging @entity28 campaign sank to a new low and @entity0 is putting on a brave face			1
@entity10 ’s team can still qualify for the knockout stage despite languishing bottom of @entity33 without a win from four games			1
and the man who will for ever be remembered for firing @entity13 to their first @entity38 title in the most dramatic way imaginable is not giving up			2
for those supporters who might not be feeling so optimistic , @entity0 has this message in response to the suggestion that he might be forced to go elsewhere in search of @entity12 glory			1
‘ not only will i stay the four years to make it eight here in total , ’ says @entity0 , who signed a new contract in august , ‘ i ’ll stay beyond that — until we win it			1
’ in the meantime , @entity13 fight on despite lengthening odds and growing criticism			2
they have lost three of their last four games in all competitions			0
talk of @entity10 carrying the can is dismissed with a polite smile , however			0
‘ it ’s easy for everyone to suddenly decide it ’s the man at the helm who is to blame , but i would say in situations like this , when we have n’t played well as a group , we are all in it together , ’ says @entity0			2
@entity0 raises a smile with store staff at his book signing session at the @entity78 on thursday ‘ the @entity12 group table is not what we would have expected			1
we are not seeing the real @entity13 playing in @entity82 at the moment , but we still have these last two games when we hope the real @entity13 will turn up			1
‘ i guess that if we do n’t turn it around , you would consider it to be the worst @entity12 campaign the club have had			2
but i have spent a lot of years in football and am aware that these things can happen , you get bad runs			0
and i am also aware that you work your way out of those bad runs and come out the other side positively			0
’ @entity0 ’s own battle against adversity is documented in his autobiography born to rise , from an impoverished upbringing in the slums of @entity102 to a place among @entity105 ’s football royalty as the husband of @entity108 ’s daughter @entity107 ( they separated when @entity1 was three )			1
the events of may 13 , 2012 feature prominently , ‘ @entity112 ’ scoring the second of @entity13 ’s two injury - time goals against @entity115 to snatch the title from @entity117 and spark scenes of delirium at the @entity78 as the hero disappeared beneath a pile of players			1
‘ you f * * * * * g idiot , i love you big b * * * * * ks , ’ is revealed as @entity127 ’s contribution to the celebrations			0
@entity0 signs a copy of his new book for a fan at the @entity78 on thursday the iconic photo of @entity0 twirling his shirt in the air hangs on his wall at home , and he has kept the boots he wore that day			1
the memories will return this evening when @entity13 face @entity115 at @entity139			2
‘ whenever you mention the words “ @entity115 ” it always comes to mind , ’ says the 26 - year - old			0
‘ that will remain etched on my memory for ever			0
i ’ve watched it back loads and loads of times , as you can imagine			0
’ it is the most significant of @entity0 ’s 87 goals in 137 games for @entity13 since he joined from @entity155 for £ 38million in 2011			1
the latest , a winner in last sunday ’s @entity158 derby , makes him the @entity38 ’s top scorer ahead of @entity161 ’s @entity160			0
no wonder @entity10 believes the striker is capable of challenging his best friend @entity164 and @entity165 for the @entity166			0
@entity0 , however , accepts that he must match @entity164 and @entity165 on the @entity28 stage before he can be considered a serious contender			2
‘ it ’s great to be mentioned in the same breath as those players , ’ he says			0
‘ but when you mention @entity164 and @entity165 , for me those guys are from another planet in football terms			0
maybe i need to put in some good performances in the @entity12 in order to be considered seriously to win the @entity166			1
if we do n’t do well in the next two games and get knocked out , the only way i ’m going to win that award is by scoring 70 goals in the @entity38 this season			1
’ even in these darkest of days , you would n’t put anything past @entity0			2
