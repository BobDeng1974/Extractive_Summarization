by @entity0 published : 05:40 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 09:23 est , 8 november 2012 defence secretary @entity1 wants to expand the reservists former servicemen are to be offered cash incentives to join the reservists , the government will announce today			1
defence secretary @entity1 is proposing the scheme as part of a package of measures intended to improve the reserve forces and place them at the heart of the @entity13			2
in a speech today , he will set out plans to enable the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) - which will be renamed the @entity16 - to play a bigger role in future operations			1
with thousands of serving personnel being made redundant through defence cuts , the scheme will enable them to rejoin the forces in a reservist capacity			2
the plans will also allow the 18,000 members of the @entity13 who voluntarily leave their jobs every year to serve again as reserves			0
another proposal is to allow regular personnel to transfer to the reserves on departure			0
mr @entity1 's announcement comes as 30,000 posts are slashed from the regular @entity13			0
the @entity16 is losing 20,000 soldiers and will be reduced to 82,000 by 2020			1
but the gap will be filled by a newly - expanded reservist force , which will be better integrated with regular troops			1
under the plans , which will be subject to a consultation , the number of training days for reservists will increase from 35 to 40 a year			2
recruits would expect to serve a six - month tour of duty at least once every five months			0
at work : the @entity16 's @entity47 ( file picture )			2
@entity16 battalions are to be better integrated with the @entity50 to bolster recruitment , they and their employers will be given more notice of mobilisations , and companies will be encouraged to hire and retain reservists			1
it is hoped the plans - to be published in a @entity60 - will enable the @entity16 to increase its size from 25,000 official members to 30,000			1
calling for a ' radical shift ' in attitudes to the so - called ' weekend warriors ' , mr @entity1 will say today : ' we 're looking for people who are going to turn out when they 're required to turn out , who are going to do the training they need to do and who are available for deployment			0
' so the message to future reservists is clear : promise us you will make the commitment ; turn up regularly to train and be prepared to deploy			0
and in return , we promise to equip you , train you , fund you and use you as an integral part of the @entity78			0
' mr @entity1 will also pledge a ' fresh start ' in the government 's relationship with reservists , who will in future be required to routinely share responsibility for ' activities once the exclusive domain of regular forces '			1
tough work : @entity16 soldiers during an exercise at @entity91 , @entity92 but shadow defence secretary @entity93 said more support for non-regular forces was needed			1
he said : ' we support action to enhance the role of the reserves , but the government can go further to protect our reservists ' patriotism			2
' if more is going to be asked of reservists , ministers must provide more support			0
anti-discrimination legislation , improved pre-deployment training and better mental healthcare are vital			0
' at a difficult time for many companies , employers must be given the support they need when their workers serve on reserve duty			0
' crucially , reserve units must be integrated with regular forces rather than form stand alone units and civilian skills must be maximised in military contexts			1

government wants *veterans* to join the reservists
plans will be formally announced later today
@entity16 recruits to be better trained and more integrated into the regular forces
