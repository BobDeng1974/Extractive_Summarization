the credibility of international cricket suffered yet another huge blow today when @entity4 chairman @entity3 was named by the highest court in @entity6 in connection with the 2013 @entity9 spot - fixing scandal			1
@entity3 , who earlier this year was forced to step down as president of the @entity6 board while investigations into the scandal continued , also heads up the @entity4 ’s rejigged anti-corruption unit – calling into question the governing body ’s capacity to police itself , let alone an entire sport			1
invited by @entity19 to comment on the news , the @entity4 replied : ‘ the @entity4 has no comment at this stage			2
’ @entity3 was named by the highest court in @entity6 in connection with the 2013 @entity9 spot - fixing scandal also named as being involved in ‘ some misdemeanour ’ relating to the corruption that blighted last year ’s @entity9 , which led to the arrest and imprisonment of three @entity28 players , were @entity3 ’s son - in - law @entity29 , the league ’s @entity30 , and @entity33 co-owner @entity32			1
it has been reported in @entity6 that three cricketers were inadvertently named by the court in connection to the investigation : former @entity40 batsman @entity39 , @entity6 all - rounder @entity41 , and @entity43 leg - spinner @entity42			1
no charge is yet to be brought			0
@entity39 was inadvertently named by the court @entity39 later released a statement saying : ' i have heard today that i have been named as implicated in the @entity48 presented to the @entity6 @entity49			1
' prior to the news this morning , i had no knowledge that i was under investigation or suspicion			1
i have not heard from , been interviewed by or received any form of correspondence from the @entity55 or the @entity49 or anyone connected with it			0
' i have no idea what allegations have been levelled at me or what case , if any , i am expected to answer			1
' i would have hoped to have received some explanation from the court that named me , but they have said nothing and made no attempt to explain themselves or to contact me , which is disappointing			1
' @entity68 to say , this is very distressing as i have as much information as those seeking comment from me			0
consequently , i will be making no further statement beyond this one and giving no interviews until i have established exactly what is going on and why i have been named			1
' that leaves six players still to be named from the 13 who were investigated by the panel , led by justice @entity79 and appointed last year by the @entity49			2
the next hearing will take place on november 24			0
the judges said : ‘ we have the seen the report			0
it does suggest some misdemeanour			0
we ca n’t withhold the report			0
for the present , we will keep the players out and will disclose only the non-players			0
’ @entity3 , who owns @entity9 franchise @entity90 , has maintained all along that he has had nothing to do with the corruption scandal that overshadowed the 2013 edition of the world ’s richest twenty20 tournament			2
yet despite being instructed to step down from the presidency of the @entity97 , @entity3 rose to the chairmanship of the @entity4 , the world game ’s governing body , in june – a position with a two - year tenure			1
he also headed up the takeover of the @entity4 earlier this year by the boards of @entity6 , @entity40 and @entity104			2
in private , the @entity105 have insisted all along that chairman @entity106 was dealing with the @entity97 as a whole rather than one individual			2
but many others queried the @entity105 ’s wisdom in working so closely with @entity3 while question marks remained about his probity			0
quite how long the @entity4 will tolerate the name of their sport being dragged through the mud by the alleged ‘ misdemeanours ’ of their own chairman is another matter			0
