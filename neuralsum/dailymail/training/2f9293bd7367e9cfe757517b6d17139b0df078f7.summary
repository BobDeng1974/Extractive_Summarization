by @entity0 published : 05:07 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 09:28 est , 12 december 2012 @entity1 was far from the suave , @entity3 gent portrayed in the 007 films , but rather a more troubled , heavy - drinking character , the new bond author claims			1
@entity7 , the novelist famed for ' @entity9 ' , and responsible for coming up with the next @entity1 novel in the @entity12 series , said that @entity1 's true character , until now , had been underplayed			2
he told the @entity14 that in the @entity17 film , starring @entity15 , @entity1 downed two bottles of bourbon , a bottle of champagne , a calvados and four dry martinis in one night			1
you know the rest : the real @entity1 was not the suave @entity34 - type @entity3 toff at all ( left ) , but rather ' nuanced and interesting ' , said @entity7			1
@entity35 , right , with a @entity30 in @entity36 ' in the films @entity1 is a cartoon character but in the novels he is far more troubled , nuanced and interesting ' , he said			2
it is the clearest indication yet that the author plans to steer away from what he described as the ' cartoon ' portrayed on film and take @entity1 in a direction more in keeping with the character 's true self			2
he pointed out that while the latest 007 film @entity49 sees @entity1 return to what is described as his childhood home in @entity53 , the reality is that @entity1 actually grew up somewhere in @entity54 , @entity3			1
@entity49 does , however , hint at @entity1 's darker side when he is shown at the beginning of the film looking washed - up and drunk , downing his sorrows in a beachfront bar			1
@entity7 admitted , however , that he deliberately avoided watching the latest film			0
the portrayal of @entity1 as an @entity3 toff is also flawed , claimed @entity7 , who said : ' @entity1 ’s father was @entity53 and his mother was @entity66 so he did n’t have a drop of @entity3 blood in him			1
he ’s not the suave @entity34 - type @entity3 toff at all			1
' while some might argue that @entity1 's @entity72 credentials justify his @entity3 gent persona , the fact , as @entity7 pointed out , is that he actually got expelled from @entity72 after a fling with a maid and completed his schooling at @entity79 's alma mater , @entity80 in @entity81 , @entity53			1
realist : bestselling @entity53 author @entity7 said he was much more interested in creating a @entity1 that is a ' human ' not a ' cartoon ' like @entity1 , @entity7 was also educated in @entity53 , at prince @entity87 ' former boarding school @entity88 , having spent his early life growing up in @entity90 , @entity91			1
he then went on to study and teach at @entity92 before abandoning it following the success of @entity95 , published in 1981			0
in april this year it was announced that he would would write the next @entity1 novel , having accepted the privilege from the @entity12 estate			2
it is understood that the book will be set in 1969 and @entity1 will be middle - aged , at 45			1
@entity7 ’s @entity1 book will be published next year , 60 years after the publication of @entity12 ’s first @entity1 novel , @entity105			2
@entity12 went on to write another 13 in the series , which has totted up sales of more than 100million			0
speaking at the @entity109 earlier this year , @entity7 said : ' he is a middle - aged man , a middle - aged spy , and that ’s one of the things that interests me			0
' i ’m a realistic novelist and what interests me about @entity1 is the human being			2
' there will be no mountains filled with atom bombs or global plagues , no gadgets , no superpowers or preposterous enemies - there will be an entirely believable psychopath , not a preposterous psychopath			0
' and similarly with love affairs - in my novel they will be entirely believable			0
” he added : ' the literary @entity1 is a far more interesting character than the @entity1 of the films , who is a sort of cartoon			0
@entity7 is the latest of three writers to take up the challenge of recreating the much - loved character			0
@entity137 released @entity138 in 2008 to mark the centenary of original author @entity12 ’s birth while @entity142 ’s @entity1 novel , @entity143 , was published last year			0
@entity144 : 007 's @entity145 and @entity35 sipping @entity30 in their tuxedos does little to portray the real @entity1 , constructed by @entity12 , believes @entity7 the man behind 007 : @entity150 author @entity12 , the creator of @entity1			0
@entity7 said that he has total freedom to characterise @entity1 as he sees fit			0

in *dr.* no @entity1 drank two bottles of bourbon , bottle of champagne , a calvados and four martinis in one night
@entity1 was *n't* an @entity3 gent - his father was @entity53 and his mother @entity66
