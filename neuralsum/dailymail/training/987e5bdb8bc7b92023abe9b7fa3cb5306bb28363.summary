treated to a hero ’s welcome at @entity3 and a civic reception at @entity6 ’s @entity5 on @entity7 on wednesday , it is surely a feeling @entity9 could get used to			1
the new @entity11 middleweight champion is the 21st @entity12 boxer to claim a legitimate world title ( current @entity15 super-bantamweight kingpin @entity14 coming before him ) and the @entity17 native has expressed his firm intention to defend the belt on home soil			1
in the ring following his sixth - round stoppage of @entity24 ’s @entity23 in @entity25 last saturday , @entity9 declared in his post-fight speech : ‘ i ’m a champion now and i want to defend my belt in @entity12			1
’ @entity9 , with his mother @entity28 , enjoys a hero ’s welcome at @entity3 on wednesday but while he is a proud @entity34 , having represented the country at the @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity9 ’s fighting story began at the famous @entity35 , originally a landmark of @entity38 ’s @entity37			1
born in @entity39 , near @entity40 , the son of settled travellers , a young @entity9 followed his elder brothers into @entity44			2
back - to - back @entity46 titles were won in 1998/99 before his family moved back to @entity17 , where he continued his boxing career at the @entity51 club , going on to claim a silver medal for @entity12 at the @entity53 in 2002 ( where he was spotted by future coach @entity54 ) and a bronze medal at the 2004 @entity56 in @entity57 , which secured his place as @entity12 ’s only boxer in @entity33			1
after opting to turn pro under @entity54 in 2006 , moving to @entity62 in the process , the @entity6 man began a paid career which has so far lasted eight - and - a - half years			0
he dedicated his victory last weekend to @entity54 , ‘ the man who made me ’ , but he has now come full circle in his boxing career , linking up with @entity38 - based trainer @entity67 and relocating to the @entity69 capital where he relaunched his career following a failed 2012 title challenge to then @entity73 champion @entity72 @entity9 stopped @entity23 in the sixth round in @entity25 in win the @entity11 middleweight world title with champion @entity77 vacating his @entity11 title , @entity9 took advantage by capitalising on the high ( no 4 ) ranking earned from his knockout of @entity81 last june to book a date with mandatory no 1 contender @entity23 , stopping the @entity24 in style			1
not only has the win seen @entity9 fulfil his ultimate ambition of becoming a world champion , but it may also secure his financial future			1
@entity9 , however , claimed he is not in it for the money			2
‘ that was never the motivation , ’ said @entity9 last weekend			2
‘ it was to do something in my life that was bigger than me and it ’ll never be taken away from me now			0
i ’ll always be a world champion			0
’ his principles and desire are characteristics which have helped him gain a deserved reputation as the gentleman of @entity12 boxing , but financial realities may yet have an influence on his future moves			2
while , ideally , @entity9 wants to fight in @entity12 , he may not be able to dictate terms despite being the champ			1
the opportunity to fight for the vacant title came as no 2 contender @entity108 opted to take on domestic rival @entity109 , whom he defeated on points last month , and @entity108 , the @entity113 and @entity114 champion ( who is also a former @entity115 ) is now the mandatory no 1 challenge @entity9 celebrates with his new belt ( left ) and referee @entity118 brings the fight to a halt ( right ) speaking to @entity122 this week , his promoter @entity121 claimed that an agreement had been made with @entity67 that allowed @entity9 to fight @entity23 for the vacant title on the understanding the new champion would fight @entity108 early next year			1
it is a fight that @entity9 claims he is more than happy to take , but only in @entity12			1
in reality , the supposed agreement between @entity67 and @entity121 is likely to mean the latter will have to acquiesce to such a proposal — something @entity121 has not ruled out — but the promoter could push for a march date in @entity38 , possibly on @entity134 ’s weekend			0
failure to come to terms would likely lead to purse bids for the promotional rights to the fight			0
but one thing is for sure — @entity9 is likely to enjoy his biggest pay day yet when it comes to his first defence , a likely six figures			2
his purse against @entity23 was $ 69,000 , but that figure would have been negotiated on the basis of getting the opportunity to fight for the title			1
a better indicator of his future purses was his opponent ’s pay , as @entity23 , mandatory challenger for the vacant belt , took home $ 160,000			0
@entity77 , who opted not to defend against @entity23 , walked away from what would have been a career - high $ 1.4m pay day			1
the fact that @entity9 is rated by @entity159 tv network @entity158 plays into his favour as tv money still pays the bills in big - time boxing			1
on the same @entity25 bill as @entity166 , headliner @entity164 earned € 2million , while across town on the same night @entity169 , a @entity170 regular , made $ 950,000			0
@entity9 ’s previous fight may be an even better barometer of his potential bank balance , considering the money splashed out that night			0
while @entity9 made $ 70,000 taking on @entity81 , the headline fight that night between @entity176 and @entity177 saw @entity176 earn a $ 3m purse ( $ 7m in total ) , with @entity177 making $ 1.5m plus pay - per - view tv money			2
@entity108 ( right ) will be @entity9 's first challenger after his victory over @entity181 last month @entity176 , the @entity73 world champion , is one of the sport ’s main money earners			2
whatever about @entity9 ’s eagerness to defend his own title , the financial rewards for fighting @entity176 would be astronomical while there is also the lure of his @entity73 belt and lineal championship			1
speaking in september , @entity9 said : ‘ he [ @entity176 ] is the [ lineal ] middleweight champion of the world and , for me , i think he ’s one of the easier champions to fight style-wise			2
’ the fact there are four ‘ major ’ world champions is a subject which irks most boxing enthusiasts as well as causal fans , but it is a reality @entity9 accepts			0
while he holds the @entity11 title , @entity176 is the @entity73 champion and ‘ the man who beat the man ’ with his lineal title traced back to the original champion			1
@entity204 holds the @entity206 championship ( and is rated by most as the best middleweight in the world ) while veteran @entity209 holds the @entity15 title			0
‘ @entity204 ’s considered the world champion , really , ’ said @entity9 , speaking to @entity212 boxing podcast			0
‘ i know , in the purest sense , having one championship belt is a nice thing and it would probably be better , genuinely , to sort everything out			0
but where there ’s more belts more people get to fight and then champions can hopefully fight each other			0
’ ideally , that is what @entity9 would aim for — a unification clash — but the shadow of @entity108 looms			0
otherwise , a domestic dust - up against @entity230 remains an option , despite his recent loss			0
if @entity67 were to negotiate with @entity121 to allow @entity9 to have a keep - busy fight in the new year before meeting @entity108 , it could open a path to a spring clash with the likes of @entity230 , where a win would set up a summer blockbuster against the mandatory challenger at @entity241			1
fanciful thinking since a march date with @entity108 seems inevitable , but dreams sometimes come true — just ask @entity9 .			0

@entity9 beat @entity23 to secure the @entity11 middleweight title
he was treated to a hero 's welcome at @entity3 on wednesday
the 30 - year - old is desperate to defend his title for the first time in @entity12
