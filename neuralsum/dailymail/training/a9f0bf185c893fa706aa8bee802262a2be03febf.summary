players union chief @entity0 has welcomed the @entity2 's review into the under - representation of black , @entity5 and minority ethnic people in coaching and management			1
@entity10 's @entity9 and @entity12 boss @entity11 are the only non-white managers in the @entity15 professional game			1
this imbalance has been a source of debate for a number of years and @entity0 , the chief executive of the @entity20 , recently spoke of ' a hidden racism which holds clubs back '			1
@entity20 boss @entity0 has hit out against a ' hidden racism ' preventing black managers from finding work @entity11 ( left ) and @entity9 ( right ) are the only two non-white managers in the professional game @entity0 has also highlighted how this under - representation extends to general coaching positions throughout the game , while around 20 - 25 per cent of professional players are not white			1
the @entity2 has now discussed this matter and pledged to work towards a solution			2
@entity0 said : ' i am delighted with the news and am very encouraged			1
' there will be a lot of people very pleased and i hope we can keep the momentum going			2
' at the start of this season we did n't have one black manager out of 92 , so it needs addressing			0
' i would n't say i 'm counting my chickens yet but i am encouraged that we can keep the momentum going with this staying on football 's agenda			2
' @entity48 has said it will be open - minded about potential solutions but @entity0 advocates an equivalent of @entity52 's ' @entity51 ' , which would compel clubs to interview at least one black , @entity5 or minority ethnic ( @entity56 ) candidate for management jobs			1
the @entity59 employs the @entity51 to address the issue of a lack of coaches from minority backgrounds the @entity51 has been used in the @entity59 since 2003 to ensure ethnic minority candidates are adequately represented in the interview process for head - coaching positions			1
@entity59 franchises must interview at least one black , @entity5 or minority ethnic ( @entity56 ) for management jobs			0
@entity0 , whose organisation supports players wishing to move into coaching or management , has also grown frustrated at what he sees as a lack of transparency in clubs ' recruitment processes			1
he said : ' of course it ( @entity51 ) is the way forward and at the moment that is all we are asking			1
' but if they want to talk about quotas that is fine , if they want to talk about lists of players who are readily available we can			0
' we want the recruitment process to be more professional , more transparent and more inclusive , and to be a fair reflection of the number of players coming through on the field of play			0
' if our members are going to go through the qualification process , at great cost to them and us , then we want a transparent policy			0
' the current ad - hoc policy is so ' rotating door ' and is costing the game millions			0
' @entity48 announced it was setting up the review following a recommendation by chairman @entity106			0
its terms of reference will be set at its next meeting on november 6 with a report and recommendations due by the end of the season			0
@entity2 chairman @entity106 is also keen on addressing the lack of non-white managers it intends to consult widely with member clubs , other leagues , the @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 , as well as the @entity20 , among the bodies to be asked for input			1
@entity106 said : ' the current under - representation of @entity56 managers and coaches in the professional game is an important matter			1
' we have consistently recognised the imbalance in representation at first - team manager level but have yet to see a comprehensive solution being proposed			0
' it is a complex issue that needs a careful and thoughtful appraisal of the current situation in @entity15 professional football			2
' this will include collecting and analysing data on @entity56 representation at all levels of the coach development pipeline , from opportunities for individuals to acquire their coaching qualifications through to appointments at first - team level			0
' the @entity51 has been suggested by some as a potential way forward , however until we have consulted fully with all parties we will remain open - minded about any potential solutions			2
' the real challenge is to increase @entity56 representation at all levels of the coaching pipeline and to ensure that there is fair access to employment opportunities for everyone			0
' to this end , the @entity2 is already actively participating in the @entity120 chairman 's @entity15 commission which is urgently seeking to address existing issues relating to coaching development , including @entity56 participation			0

@entity9 and @entity11 are the only non-white managers
@entity0 *believes* the matter needs to be addressed
the @entity20 chief is in *favour* of introducing the @entity51 into football
