defence : @entity69 , pictured arriving in @entity116 , @entity117 , today has said he would not call film ' erotic ' ' so it had to be a really strong part of the story , and i had to give characterisation to each sex scene , to make them different			2
' i did n't want it to be graphically explicit , and i know that 's going to be disappointing to some people , ' mrs @entity104 added in an interview with @entity132 newspaper : ' it 's the build up and titillation of touch and sensuality			0
