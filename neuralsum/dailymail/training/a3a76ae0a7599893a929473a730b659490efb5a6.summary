' you should always complement your face with the shape of a hat , ' insists @entity3			2
' for example , if your face is round , wear an angular hat that cuts across your face			0

' @entity113 tailored cocktail hats , pastels and coral are also a good choice , while aqua and nude are going to be as popular as ever this year			1
