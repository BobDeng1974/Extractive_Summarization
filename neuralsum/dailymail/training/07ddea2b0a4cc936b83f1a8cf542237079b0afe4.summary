the first clip from the highly anticipated @entity1 : the @entity2 will be shown in the @entity3 on friday … but some fans have been taken in ahead of its release by cleverly made fake trailers			1
a teaser trailer for @entity9 will be shown in at least 100 theaters across @entity3			1
it ’ll be the first ever glimpse of @entity14 ' blockbuster			0
however , lots of people thought they ’d already had one			0
it contains slickly edited @entity1 scenes and dramatic voiceovers – even the logos for @entity34 and @entity14 ’ production company @entity33 – and fooled lots of users			1
comments such as ‘ amazing ’ and ‘ incredible ’ were posted underneath it , but some quickly figured out that it was a compilation of shots from various films and computer games			0
one user realised it was fake from the sound quality			2
@entity46 said : ‘ i 'm an audio engineer and trust me no self respecting studio would ever mix the voices so they could barely be understood because of blaring music and sound effects , just trash			0
’ another phony trailer called @entity1 : the @entity2 - @entity54 2015 cheekily used sequences from hit video game @entity56 – but still pulled the wool over the eyes of some users			1
does n't compute : this shot , from a supposed @entity1 trailer , is actually from the trailer for video game @entity56 hole load of phony : another scene from @entity56 passed off as @entity68 @entity69 — @entity70 22 & @entity71 @entity72 — @entity73 & @entity74 @entity76 @entity75 — @entity77 & @entity74 @entity79 @entity78 — @entity80 & @entity74 @entity81 @entity82 — @entity83 14 @entity84 — @entity85 22 & @entity71 @entity86 — @entity87 & @entity74 @entity89 @entity88 — @entity90 & @entity74 @entity92 @entity91 — @entity93 14 & @entity71 one user said ‘ that looked real for a minute ! ’ , while another wrote ‘ this looks awesome ! ’ @entity98 , meanwhile , made little effort to pretend it was real , with every shot containing exaggerated lens flare – one of @entity14 ’ favorite techniques			1
the real trailer is expected to be shown for only two days , but will also be available on @entity106			1
@entity107 announced that the real trailer will play before all movies showing at nine of its locations			2
some of the locations where the trailer will be shown are the @entity113 22 & @entity71 in @entity69 , @entity114 , the @entity73 18 @entity71 & @entity74 in @entity72 , @entity114 , the @entity77 18 @entity71 & @entity74 in @entity75 , @entity76 , the @entity80 14 @entity71 & @entity74 in @entity78 , @entity79 and the @entity115 14 in @entity82 , among others			2
more locations could be announced , maybe from other chains as well			0
the trailer is reportedly not very long - a minute at most - and will include only a few glimpses as there has not been enough time to edit and polish the footage			0
@entity14 has revealed little teases about the film @entity125 has shared a quick look at the @entity128 and also the x-wing			0
the film is set 30 years after @entity131 and is being produced by @entity132 , @entity133 , and @entity134 will be released on december 18 , 2015			0
and for comparison , here 's the real thing : the first cast and crew meeting : director @entity14 chats with @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 , among others , in @entity146 earlier this year before filming began the lord in black : the new film is set 30 years after @entity150 , seen here in @entity1 : the empire strikes back , perished			1
