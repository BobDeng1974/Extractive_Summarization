by @entity0 published : 14:20 est , 5 october 2013 updated : 01:14 est , 6 october 2013 education officials in the nation 's second - largest school district are working to reboot a $ 1 billion plan to put an @entity5 in the hands of each of their 650,000 students after an embarrassing glitch emerged when the first round of tablets went out			1
instead of solving math problems or doing @entity16 homework , as administrators envisioned , more than 300 @entity13 students promptly cracked the security settings and started tweeting , posting to @entity19 and playing video games			1
' oh , and some car racing game i ca n't remember the name of , ' said freshman @entity26 , laughing as she described the games she saw fellow @entity29 students playing in class last week			0
rollout on pause : the tampered @entity5 could access unauthorized websites and apps , such as @entity19 , @entity34 , and @entity35			2
workers at the @entity37 ( @entity13 ) have started confiscating @entity5 that bypassed the devices ' security measures that incident , and related problems , had both critics and supporters questioning this week whether @entity13 officials were being hasty or overreaching in their attempt to distribute an @entity5 to every student and teacher at the district 's more than 1,000 campuses by next year			1
' it does n't seem like there was much planning that went into this strategy , ' said @entity54 , director of the @entity55 at the @entity56			0
' that 's where the debacle began			0
' it 's crucial , she said , to spend extensive time drawing students into a discussion on using @entity5 responsibly before handing them out			1
and , of course , installing a firewall that ca n't be easily breached			0
at @entity29 , it was the unanimous opinion of more than a dozen students that the school district 's security setup was so weak that even the most tech - challenged parent could have gotten past it			1
stealing students : despite the disappearance of 71 @entity5 so far , 640,000 students in @entity77 will eventually receive free @entity80 tablets for educational purposes			1
' it was so easy ! ' said freshman @entity83			0
he explained that all one needed to do was access the tablet 's settings , delete the profile established by the school district and set up an internet connection			1
he did it , he said , because he wanted to go on @entity19			0
' they kind of should have known this would happen , ' said @entity95 's friend @entity94			0
' we 're high school students after all			2
i mean , come on , ' she added			0
golden deal : the @entity13 embarked on a $ 1 billion initiative to place an @entity5 in the hands of each of the more than 600,000 students in the nation 's second largest school district as word spread , with the speed of a microprocessor , that anyone could crack the firewall , officials quickly confiscated the devices and put a freeze on using them off campus			1
in the meantime , they promised to improve the security settings			1
when they started distributing the @entity5 at 47 district schools in august , administrators touted the move as a means of leveling the academic playing field in a public school system where 80 percent of the students come from low - income families			1
now , they said , everyone would have equal access to the most cutting - edge educational software programs , not just the children of parents with deep pockets			2
but after the first shot in that digital revolution led to a flood of tweets , other concerns arose			0
among them : - who pays if a kid drops one of these $ 678 gadgets into a toilet or leaves it on a bus ? - is it realistic to tell a student she can use it to do her homework , then not allow the device to connect to the internet from home ? ( schools will be wired			2
) - and since the tablet without web access is only as good as the educational software placed on it , how good is that software ? a parent , @entity157 , said he heard from one source that families would have to pay for broken @entity5 and from another that the school would			1
district officials have said there was confusion over that issue but that it 's been decided schools will cover the cost of an @entity5 accidentally broken , lost or stolen , while families are on the hook for one negligently damaged			2
of more serious concern to @entity171 is the software			0
he sampled one of the new @entity5 , he said , and found no program to adequately support @entity16 - as - a - second - language students			1
that would seemingly be crucial for a district whose students are 73 percent hispanic and where only 14 percent of @entity16 learners can speak the language fluently , according to a 2011 @entity184 study			0
as a parent representative to the district 's bond oversight committee , @entity171 voted to recommend spending $ 30 million last june to buy the first batch of @entity5			1
he says he still supports the program but worries that maybe educators are trying to implement it too quickly			0
' this is the future , ' he said			0
' but whether @entity13 is stepping too quickly into the future - based on the fact that it 's so big , and we seem to be in such a hurry - those are questions to consider			2
' although the scheme to distribute @entity5 is well intentioned , at least 71 @entity5 went missing last year from the @entity13			0
the lost devices , worth a total of just over $ 48k , are among the @entity5 used in a 13 - school trial run of a $ 1 billion program designed to improve education			1
. the bulk of the 71 missing devices worth $ 678 each , disappeared from one school called @entity207 in @entity208 , @entity77			2
approximately 1,200 @entity5 were distributed to the school last year			2
by year 's end , 69 were unaccounted for			0

@entity213 school system will spend $ *1b* on program that supplies nation 's second - largest school system with free @entity5
nearly 300 students figured out how to alter school supplied @entity5 's security settings to surf the @entity221 and access *social* media sites
640,000 @entity77 students , k - 12 , will have free @entity5 by 2014
