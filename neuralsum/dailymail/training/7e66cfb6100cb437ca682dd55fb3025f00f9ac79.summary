@entity4 ( @entity5 ) , which released the figures , said last year there were 448,422 diagnoses - a rise of five per cent from 2011			1
health officials are warning that the latest rise in the number of diagnoses means too many people are putting themselves at risk through unsafe sex			2
half a million people were diagnosed with an @entity17 in the @entity3 last year and health experts are worried too many people are putting themselves at risk almost half of all infections – 46 per cent - were chlamydia , and new gonorrhea diagnoses rose by 21 per cent			1
this is a concern for health experts as the global threat of antibiotic resistance grows			1
dr @entity29 , @entity5 head of @entity17 surveillance , said : ‘ there have been significant improvements in screening in recent years , particularly for gonorrhea and chlamydia among young adults and men who have sex with men , so we are diagnosing and treating more infections than ever before			2
‘ however , these data show too many people are continuing to have unsafe sex , put themselves at risk of @entity46 and the serious consequences associated with infection , including infertility			0
‘ ongoing investment in programmes to increase sexual health awareness , condom use and testing , particularly for groups at most risk , is vital			0
’ new gonorrhea ( pictured ) diagnoses rose by 21 per cent , which is concerning health experts as the global threat of antibiotic resistance grows those under 25 experienced the highest rates of @entity46 , contributing 64 per cent of all chlamydia and 54 per cent of all genital warts diagnoses in heterosexuals in 2012			1
dr @entity29 said : ‘ we must also ensure chlamydia screening remains widely available			0
‘ local authorities should continue to integrate chlamydia screening into broader health services for young adults			0
‘ this will also help this age group develop positive relationships with services , enabling them to develop and maintain good sexual health throughout their lives			0
’ professor @entity81 , @entity5 director of health and wellbeing , said : ‘ we are committed to improving the nation 's sexual health , with a focus on the groups most at risk , and will provide local authorities and clinical commissioning groups with data on local health needs , coupled with evidence - based advice on @entity17 prevention and sexual health promotion approaches , to improve risk awareness and encourage safer sexual behaviours			0
