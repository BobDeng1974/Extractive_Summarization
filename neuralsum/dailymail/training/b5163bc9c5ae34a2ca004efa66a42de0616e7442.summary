a couple have been ordered to rip down their £ 200,000 luxury house annexe - because it was built 20 centimetres too wide			1
@entity3 and @entity4 transformed a decaying old barn in the garden of their home in @entity9 , @entity10 , into a luxury building with offices , a gym and three guest bedrooms			1
but planning bosses have told them to tear the annexe down because it is 20cm too wide and the chimney and porch were said to be ' harmful to the countryside '			1
@entity3 and @entity4 have been ordered to rip down their £ 200,000 luxury house annexe ( pictured left ) in @entity9 , @entity10 , because it was 20 centimetres too wide mr @entity22 , a heating engineer , said : ' this is a terrible joke that is fast becoming a nightmare and has cost us so far in the region of £ 200,000 , not to mention thousands of pounds in extras caused by legal fees , red tape and the appeal to the @entity32			1
' we have not done anything wrong			0
' work in the front garden of their home started earlier this year after mr @entity22 bought the former pub seven years ago			0
the couple reassured planning bosses they would not live in the annexe or rent it out and offered to remove the chimney and porch , but were told to appeal the order			1
mrs @entity4 said : ' this is very upsetting because we thought we were doing the right thing by improving the old barn , which was in a dangerous condition			2
we are not overlooked by anybody , nobody has complained			0
' they are quibbling over 20 centimetres			0
and how can a chimney and porch be harmful to the countryside ? ' the couple transformed a decaying old barn in the garden of their home in @entity9 , @entity10 , into a luxury building with offices , a gym and three guest bedrooms @entity67 slapped an enforcement notice on the couple in july , which gave them two months to comply or face legal action			1
in a hand - delivered letter , @entity72 , head of the council 's development management team , said the building was in an unsuitable location outside of settlement limits , in an area designated as countryside			2
cllr @entity81 , executive member for highways and planning , said : ' this is n’t the case that the owners of @entity87 and @entity89 cottage have built a building that ’s 20cm to large as claimed – it ’s a much bigger issue than that and one that we have to tackle as part of our duty as the local planning authority			2
quite simply , the owners have built a house in the countryside that they do n’t have permission for			0
' and this is not acceptable			0
i hope this sends a clear message that we will take action against people who flout planning laws			0
' i would urge anyone who suspects someone of carrying out major work without planning permission to get in touch with the council and we will investigate			0
' the couple have now appealed to the @entity32 and will not know the final decision until next year .			1
