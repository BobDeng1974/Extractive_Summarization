@entity0 has been urged to copy @entity1 's military - led ' stop the boats ' policy to avoid migrant tragedies in the @entity5			1
@entity1 pm @entity6 – who sends naval gunboats to turn back asylum seekers before they reach @entity1 – said the @entity9 should ' urgently ' follow his lead			1
his hardline policy has proved controversial but mr @entity6 said it was the only way to prevent disasters such as the loss of 900 lives when a fishing boat capsized on saturday night			1
hardline : @entity6 , whose conservative government introduced a military - led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum - seekers before they reach @entity1 , said harsh measures are the only way to stop deaths haunted : surviving immigrants who escaped the boat that capsized in the @entity5 killing up to 900 people appear deep in thought as they arrive in the @entity28 port city of @entity29 yesterday morning solemn : a young man , bows his head as he makes the short walk from the rescue boat 's deck to the @entity29 shore where hundreds of people had gathered new life : members of the @entity41 police look on as a migrant who survived the ship sinking off the coast of @entity45 walks the ramp of an @entity41 @entity48 's vessel upon arrival at @entity29 's port yesterday morning he said : ' the only way you can stop the deaths is to stop the boats			1
' that 's why it is so urgent that the countries of @entity0 adopt very strong policies that will end the people - smuggling trade across the @entity5			2
' conservative mr @entity6 won power in 2013 on a ' stop the boats ' pledge , and not a single one has breached his ring of steel in 18 months			1
@entity67 involves the @entity1 navy intercepting boats filled with migrants at sea , and either turning them back or towing them back to where they came from			1
mr @entity6 has previously said he was sick of being lectured to by the @entity74 over @entity1 's obligations to refugees , saying his policy was the ' most decent , most compassionate ' solution			1
in the @entity5 , callous people smugglers have been exploiting a willingness by @entity0 nations to rescue migrants rather than send them back			1
last year , @entity41 scaled back its rescue operations because it feared they were only encouraging migrants to gamble with their lives			1
but the horrific loss of life over the past week in a spate of migrant shipwrecks has prompted calls to urgently reinstate the rescue missions			2
@entity9 leaders including @entity94 are meeting tomorrow in what charities are calling a ' life or death ' summit to solve the problem			2
@entity101 warned that 2,500 youngsters could die in the @entity5 this year			2
chief executive @entity103 said : ' @entity9 leaders hold the lives of thousands of desperate people in their hands when they meet			0
' with every day that they prevaricate and delay restarting search and rescue operations , the risk grows that more people will die			0
' taken to safety : an unknown survivor of the @entity5 migrant tragedy is wheeled off an @entity41 coastguard ship in the @entity28 city of @entity29 horror : a man carries the body of a dead child onto the @entity122 island of @entity123 after a boat carrying dozens of people ran aground , killing at least three in one of a number of tragedies involving migrants in recent days chaos : @entity131 footage shows a large , wooden double - masted boat with people packed on board , just metres away from the @entity122 island of @entity123 in the eastern @entity5 migrant boats approaching @entity1 waters are turned back by the @entity137 or sometimes even towed back to where they came from			1
any vessels which manage to get close are taken under naval escort to the @entity142 of @entity143 or @entity144 , where they are detained while migrants ' asylum claims are processed			1
migrants are then matched with a country that will resettle them			2
those detained on @entity143 are sent to @entity152 , which is paid to take them by the @entity1 government			1
a similar arrangement exists with @entity144 for those detained there			0
any migrants who actually make it to @entity1 by sea are automatically blocked from staying – even if they are found to be genuine refugees			1
the controversial scheme – which began 18 months ago has been attacked by human rights advocates who say it violates @entity1 's international obligations			1
however the government says it has greatly reduced the number of illegal immigrants arriving on @entity1 shores			1
yesterday mr @entity94 pledged the @entity170 would ' make a contribution ' to search and rescue operations			0
foreign secretary @entity173 said refugees also needed to be persuaded to stay in their home countries in the first place			0
' we 've got to start in the upstream countries			0
we 've got to deal with the traffickers , ' he said , adding he ' absolutely ' supported a ' more formidable operation on the sea '			2
@entity183 said the government 's policy of ' leaving people to drown ' had been ' wrong '			0
the @entity188 leader said : ' frankly i think it is a stain on @entity0 to have these things happening			0
' we 've got to act on search and rescue , and that is about basic humanity and i think that people all around the country will recognise this			0
' @entity200 mayor @entity199 said @entity170 had a ' moral duty ' to do more			0
' i think it is an absolute tragedy and obviously we must do whatever we can to help the humanitarian response , ' he said			0
one of the architects of @entity1 's tough border policies , retired @entity208 major - general @entity207 , said @entity0 leaders were guilty of ' incompetence '			1
mr @entity207 said the tragedies were ' worsened by @entity0 's refusal to learn from its own mistakes and from the efforts of others who have handled similar problems '			0
in the @entity5 , the tide of human misery has only worsened			0
saturday 's disaster was the most catastrophic in a series of migrant shipwrecks that have claimed more than 1,700 lives this year – 30 times higher than the same period in 2014			2
in the past week alone , more than 1,000 have died			0
border chiefs have warned that one million migrants are waiting to set sail off the coast of @entity45 , with the need for drastic action to address the crisis greater than ever before			2
@entity232 's prime minister @entity231 has warned of a ' genocide ' and said : ' @entity0 will be judged harshly for its inaction			0
' rescue : a woman is laid to the ground after being rescued by @entity122 men as she tried to reach @entity0 aboard a wooden boat which ran aground on the island of @entity123 , killing three people saved : three people died after a boat carrying dozens of migrants ran aground on the @entity122 island of @entity123 sunday morning : @entity41 coastguard responds to migrant ship after it capsizes off the coast of @entity45 with 700 passengers unaccounted for sunday afternoon : passengers accounts of the ship say as many as 950 people may have been on board with 300 locked in the hull			1

among them is the crew 's @entity277 captain and his @entity256 crew member			0
both were arrested and charged with ' favouring illegal immigration '			0
the captain was additionally charged with multiple manslaughter .			0
