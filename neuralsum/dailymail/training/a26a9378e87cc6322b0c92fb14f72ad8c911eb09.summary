by @entity0 published : 10:33 est , 17 may 2012 updated : 10:33 est , 17 may 2012 this is the shoddy work of a cowboy builder caught in a tv sting after tricking homeowners into handing over 90 per cent of the payment upfront - and then leaving before the job is done			1
@entity8 , 56 , left dozens of homes across @entity10 in a ' state of ruin ' and in need of emergency structural repairs over a five - year period in a £ 370,000 rip - off			1
many of the homes he targeted were left with gaping holes in walls or with full skips in the driveway which had not been paid for			2
shoddy : a house is left without a roof and the metal beam exposed after the conman fled from a half finished job bodged job : an uninhabitable room left abandoned after most of the money had been paid upfront others had to be re-wired or re-plumbed because they work was unsafe			1
at one property @entity8 had fled with the roof uncovered after the old one had been stropped away - but before a new one had been fitted			1
in another instance , foundations were laid for an extension and the first few layers of bricks were laid before the conman fled			0
some were left in such a dangerous condition they were in peril of collapsing and homeowners had to stump up tens of thousands to get professional builders in to complete the job before they could move back in			2
poor workmanship : an example of the shoddy work carried out by jailed conman @entity8 many owners had to re-mortgage their homes in order to pay for builders to come in and fix @entity8 's shoddy work			1
@entity8 was jailed for five years at @entity56 earlier this month after being found guilty of 10 charges of fraud and one of obtaining money by deception			1
the conman , from @entity63 , @entity64 , targeted vulnerable people and after starting work convinced customers to hand over as much cash as possible before he vanished			0
the deception - which happened between 2006 and 2010 - was exposed on @entity71 's @entity70			0
in total , cowboy builders rip off homeowners by a staggering £ 260m a year , a study has revealed			2
according to research done by the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) , people who pay builders in cash lose the equivalent of £ 712,000 - a - day in shoddy work , which then has to be repaired			1
jailed conman : @entity8 who was given five years behind bars for carrying out the £ 370,000 fraud caught out : @entity8 , right , is confronted by tv presenter @entity86 as his scam comes undone on cowboy builders a spokesman for the @entity80 , the largest trade association in the @entity91 building industry with a membership of 12,000 building firms , said that paying for work in cash was ‘ dangerous ’			1
the research by the @entity80 showed that of the 1,000 people quizzed in the poll , a total of 11 per cent said they had ended up with shoddy workmanship which they then needed to get redone			0
of that 11 per cent , 76 per cent had paid in cash - showing that using ready cash to pay builders was more likely to lead to poor quality work			1
@entity106 , spokesperson for the @entity80 , said today : ' before employing a builder , it is vital to carry out checks to make sure you are using someone reputable , such as an @entity80 builder			0
' choosing your builder on price alone can be a false economy which may neither add value to your property nor make for a smooth building project			0
' extension going nowhere : the first few layers of bricks had been made when @entity8 abandoned this building site @entity124 , the presenter of @entity125 on @entity126 , said : ' if you pay a builder large amounts of cash upfront then you leave yourself vulnerable to them increasing the price or walking off the job half - way through and you do n't have any warranty if it all goes wrong			1
' by using a reputable builder , signing a contract , and organising staged payments with receipts , you will have recourse if it all goes wrong			0
' many of @entity8 's crimes took place in the @entity145 of @entity146			2
after he was jailed , @entity147 released photos of some of his shoddy building work			1
the council said @entity8 traded under a range of company names , including @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 , before he was snared			0

sentencing @entity8 to five years in jail , judge @entity173 said : ' it beggared belief that he would inflict such harm			2
' nothing will compensate the victims for the distress and misery caused			0
' the court heard how the total amount paid by victims was £ 370,000 - but that with the increased costs of getting the job done properly meant victims would be ' left considerably out of pocket '			2
@entity147 added that it had made an application under the @entity190 to seize @entity8 's assets			0
councillor @entity192 said : ' we are delighted with the outcome of this case and the time is now conducting a financial investigation into any financial gains made so the council can seek to recover any sums that were overpaid			0
' the outcome of this case sends out a very strong message that we will not tolerate criminals preying on @entity146 residents and our trading standards team is doing everything humanly possible to make sure that the perpetrators of such crimes are brought to justice			0
