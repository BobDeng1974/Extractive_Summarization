’ the @entity11 ’s other women – home secretary @entity23 , @entity25 secretary @entity24 and international development secretary @entity26 – have no children			1
@entity29 ’s media spokesman @entity28 said it was a ‘ foolish ’ choice of words			2

’ mrs @entity5 today hosted a summit in @entity39 with senior figures from internet , communications and computing firms including @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46			1
the meeting agreed a new approach to tackling online child abuse images with a beefed - up role for the internet watchdog			1
mrs @entity5 said they had agreed a ‘ fundamental change ’ to the way the @entity55 ( @entity55 ) works , with the industry - funded body set to adopt a role actively seeking out and blocking child pornography			1
the main @entity61 internet service providers ( @entity60 ) have agreed to provide extra funding for the @entity55 , understood to amount to £ 1 million , to help it take on the extra duties			2
under current arrangements the @entity55 only acts on content that has been reported to it rather than proactively seeking out illegal images			2
representatives from @entity70 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity46 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and three were summoned to the meeting			1
the @entity5 said illegal child abuse images had caused concerns ‘ particularly in recent months ’			1
checks : the @entity55 is to have a beefed up role in actively seeking out and blocking child pornography ( file picture ) the parents of murdered children @entity89 and @entity90 have called for more action to tackle child porn on the internet as the government and technology giants agreed a new crackdown			1
in interviews with @entity103 , five - year - old april 's parents @entity98 and @entity99 and 12 - year - old @entity101 's father @entity100 both agreed their children 's killers were spurred on by sick images found online			1
@entity89 , who killed april in @entity108 , and @entity90 , murderer of @entity101 in south @entity110 , were both found to have accessed child and violent pornography and some experts argue there is a clear link between their obsessions and their actions			2
mr and mrs @entity99 told @entity103 that they want prime minister @entity120 to get personally involved in the fight against child abuse online			1
mrs @entity99 said : ' april was a fighter from the word go and i promised her i 'll do this for her			2
" i said i 'll help other children , so their family do n't have to go through this , their brothers and sisters			1
' it 's not just us it affects , it affects brothers and sisters as well			0
' i just want it stopped and i think the government should put more pressure and get it done now			0
' mr @entity138 has told @entity103 that stopping indecent images of children from being published online could have saved his daughter @entity101 , who was brutally murdered by @entity90			1
he said : ' you 're fuelling the beast and it needs to be stopped , it should have been stopped a long time ago when these people were setting up companies they should be looking at , right , what would be the outcome of indecent images of children ? ' @entity89 , who killed @entity89 , and @entity90 , murderer of @entity90 , were both found to have accessed child and violent pornography and some experts argue there is a clear link between their obsessions and their actions			2
mrs @entity5 added : ‘ i think any parent or anybody who is a resident in this country wants to see illegal child abuse images dealt with , and dealt with swiftly			1
’ but aides to the minister last night actively highlighted the fact that she is the ‘ only mother in the @entity11 ’			1
@entity28 , @entity29 ’s shadow media minister , said : ‘ i think that was foolish			2
it would be much better to come to @entity39 and say this is what we are thinking than briefing that you are the only mother in the @entity11			0
i do n’t think we care about that			0
' ms @entity28 claimed the package agree was a ' damp squib '			0
she added : ' the job of secretary of state is to stand up to the industry not to start talking about her personality and family situation			0
‘ we are not interested in how much people care			0
we are interested in how effective they are			0
there is not caring and wringing your hands if you do n’t make some change			0
’ she added that it was ‘ really shocking ’ that mr @entity120 only had one mother in @entity11			0
the remark risks being seen as insensitive towards her @entity11 colleagues			2
home secretary @entity23 , the most senior woman in @entity61 politics , last year revealed her sense of loss at not being a mother			0
she said : ‘ it just did n’t happen			0
i mean , this is n’t something i generally go into , but things just turned out as they did			0
‘ you look at families all the time and you see there is something there that you do n’t have , ’ she told the @entity200			0
other cabinet ministers without children include @entity26 , @entity210 and @entity211			1

‘ for many years this has been our goal			0
sadly this has proved more difficult for us than for most couples			0
’ it was also noted that @entity224 minister @entity223 , who attends @entity11 but is not a full member , has a daughter			2
a @entity228 colleague said : ‘ @entity5 has been briefed against and is probably defending herself from the recent continuous background attacks			1
‘ however her language was a little bit sloppy , protecting vulnerable people and enhancing online safety measures is a matter for all policy makers , whether they are a mother , father , grandparent , aunt uncles or simply a constituency @entity240			0
