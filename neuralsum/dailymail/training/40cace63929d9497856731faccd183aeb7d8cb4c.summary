it is almost 28 years to the day since @entity1 knocked @entity2 out of the 1986 @entity3 , but @entity4 let bygones be bygones as the former @entity2 striker joked with the @entity8 legend about his infamous ' @entity10 ' goal			1
@entity4 took time out from his role as a @entity13 pundit in @entity14 to appear on @entity1 's live tv show on sunday and , in @entity16 , joked : ' it is 28 years ago today , right ? how 's that hand of yours ? ' the pair have a history together after the former @entity21 forward tracked the @entity3 winner to @entity23 in 2006 for @entity13 documentary , ' when @entity4 met @entity1 '			1
@entity1 admitted the ' @entity10 ' goal was ' cunning ' on his part , but is yet to call it an act of cheating			0
it emerged the @entity13 paid an undisclosed fee to @entity1 to appear on the show , with £ 50,000 the alleged amount			0
the pair looked in high spirits joking together in the studio as @entity64 first held @entity1 's right arm aloft on the daily @entity67 tv show , before the @entity68 corrected him with his left			1
it was n't all about that infamous goal , though , as @entity4 went on to describe @entity1 's second , where he took on @entity27 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 twice , as ' the best i saw in my career '			2
the ' @entity80 ' goal has never sat right with the majority of @entity2 fans , least of all that day 's goalkeeper @entity41 , but @entity64 seems to have gotten over the controversy			0

@entity4 , during his search for @entity1 in his documentary ahead of the 2006 @entity3 , was told the handball was ' cunning ' by the man himself			2
the @entity8 hero is yet to admit to cheating			0
the @entity13 admitted to paying an undisclosed fee to @entity1 to appear in the show , with £ 50,000 the alleged amount			0
truce : @entity1 tells @entity4 an explanation of his infamous 1986 @entity3 goal that killed @entity2 ' when @entity4 met @entity1 ' : the pair discussed their past controversies , namely 1986 , in the documentary back in the day : @entity4 meets @entity1 in 2006 during the @entity13 's documentary			1
