@entity1 users have seemingly stopped upgrading to its latest @entity3 software , which has had tech analysts wondering why			1
since it was released in mid-september , barely half of users have made the switch from @entity8 or earlier versions , according to official @entity1 figures			1
but now a developer has claimed that the reason is that the software is too ‘ nerdy ’ , and its features simply go over the heads of regular people			2
since its release in september barely half of @entity1 users have upgraded			1
developer @entity22 tells @entity23 this may be because it 's a ' nerd release '			1
he said many of the features may go over the head of casual consumers as of 5 october , only 47 per cent of @entity1 owners were using @entity3 8 , which includes those using @entity32 6 and 6 @entity34 's pre-installed version speaking to @entity23 , developer @entity22 said : ‘ [ ios 8 is ] a nerd release			1
‘ can you think of any non-power - user features that it ’s worth upgrading for ? ' he said that of the various features included in @entity3 , many of them were simply not of interest to casual owners			1
mr @entity22 continued : ‘ @entity45 and @entity46 are useless until all the accessory makers get on board			2
extensions and third party keyboards are great , but a casual user is n’t going to understand or care about them			2
’ in addition other planned features for @entity3 are yet to be released			1
continuity , which allows users to switch tasks between @entity1 devices , comes out later this month , around a similar time that @entity1 's mobile payment service @entity61 will be available			1
so it might be that some are simply waiting for these new features - or perhaps the appeal of @entity3 is just not alluring enough to tempt people to switch			1
earlier this week it was revealed the flood of people downloading @entity70 8 had slowed to a trickle			0
from 21 september , four days after @entity3 debuted , the percentage of users accessing the @entity74 on @entity3 had increased only 1 per cent to 47 per cent of users			1
this follows various teething problems for @entity3 after its release			1
users complained of a glitch in the updated @entity82 app that sent accidental selfies to contacts and the health app had a bug that forced @entity1 to pull other third - party apps			1
the @entity32 6 ( shown ) had record - breaking sales during the first days of its release , but users on other phones have been hesitant to adopt the new @entity3 platform as numerous bugs and glitches have been reported			1
@entity1 was forced to kill an early update after it stopped the fingerprint sensor from working the first update to @entity3 was worse , with software that stopped the fingerprint sensor from working and prevented users from making calls			1
@entity1 was forced to kill that update in the first few hours and offer a way for people to downgrade to a previous version			2
however it was reported by @entity105 that the method the company uses to measure users , tracking when they visit the @entity74 , is ‘ very unscientific ’			2
this may account for the seemingly slow uptake by users			2
@entity112 reported that the @entity8 adoption rate was 69.7 percent 20 days after the update was launched back in 2013			0
the search function on @entity1 ’s @entity117 app ( pictured ) has been improved to make it easier to find photos , based on location , dates or album name			1

@entity1 has now added time - lapse video modes , accessible through the @entity153 button on the @entity155 app. messages the @entity82 app in @entity3 takes on @entity137 by letting users capture sounds to send in conversations , including voice notes , ambient sounds or music			1

interactive @entity188 one of the stand - out features mentioned by @entity190 , @entity1 ’s senior vice president of software engineering , at @entity3 's unveiling in june was the @entity193 tool			1
this feature let users reply to texts , emails , accept calendar invites , tweet and send @entity201 messages straight from the notification banner			0
this means they do n’t have to open the specific app , or leave the app they were already using			0
with @entity3 8 , pressing the home button twice opens the multitasking menu			2
along the top , users will now see the faces of people they ’ve recently talked to , and by swiping to the right , their favourite contacts			0
this means they can call or text these people with one tap			0
and when contacts send calendar invites , for example , they can be added to the diary from the top of the screen			0
@entity225 in @entity3 8 , @entity1 has added support for more third - party keyboards and improved its own keyboard to add predictive text			1
in @entity3 8 , @entity1 has added support for more third - party keyboards and improved its own keyboard to add predictive text ( pictured ) as a user types , they ’ll see a choice of words or phrases the software thinks they will type next , based on past conversations and writing style			1
the software can also distinguish between informal languages uses in the @entity82 app , for example , and more formal language when using the @entity246 app. it also adjusts the style based on the person the user is communicating with , because their choice of words is likely more laid back with a spouse than with a boss			0
@entity256 with @entity259 , up to six people in a family can share purchases from @entity261 , ibooks and the @entity74 without sharing accounts			0
this means family purchases can be paid with the same credit card , and a child ’s spending has to be approved from a parent ’s device			0
photos and family calendars can also be shared more easily , and everyone on the account can contribute photos to shared albums , for example			0
health the new health app on @entity3 features a dashboard showing all the user ’s health and ﬁtness data			2
@entity1 has also created a tool for developers called @entity286 , which syncs other health and fitness apps together			2
the health app puts all heart rate , calories burned , blood sugar , and cholesterol information in one place , and blood type and allergy information can be accessed from the @entity296 , in case of an emergency			0
@entity1 has also improved its spotlight tool , ( pictured ) which searches for files and information on the device , and the @entity304 app now considers the answer , and uses context to provide the most relevant choices spotlight @entity1 has also improved its spotlight tool , which searches for files and information on the device , and the web			2

when searching for a person , item or term , a @entity315 snippet will appear			0
the new @entity319 identifies hot topics , and knows what ’s trending			0
