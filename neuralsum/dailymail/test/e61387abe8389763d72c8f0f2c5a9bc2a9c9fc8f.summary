a nervous @entity0 was back at @entity1 on friday to watch her beau @entity2 in his quest for a fifth @entity6 title - and fifth green jacket			1
and while it was a good day @entity2 , the golfing great still had some stressful moments and still has a way to go in catching up to leader , 21 - year - old @entity11			1
heading into the weekend he is a very , very distant 12 strokes behind a seemingly unstoppable @entity11 , with 36 holes left to play			1
the former world number one has been under intense scrutiny after struggling badly with his chipping when last seen on the @entity34 but he played solidly at steamy @entity35 to card a three - under - par 69			1
that left @entity22 at two - under 142 , far behind the @entity36 , but still delighted to be in contention after working hard to resurrect his game			2
if @entity11 wins he would tie the record for the youngest winner in @entity6 history with @entity22 this was @entity18 's second day in a row cheering on @entity22 ' i 'm still right there , ' 14 - time major winner @entity2 said of his position going into the weekend ' i was at a pretty low one ( point ) in my career , ' @entity2 said after mixing four birdies with a bogey to climb into a tie for 14th when he ended his round			1
' to basically change an entire ( swing ) pattern like that and put it together , put it in a position where i can compete in a major championship like this is something i 'm very proud of			0
' woods , who plunged to 111th in the rankings as he struggled to return to form following back surgery last year and his fifth swing change , again struggled with the pace of @entity35 's heavily contoured greens			0
' i had a hard time getting the ball close to the hole , ' said @entity2			2
' you expect certain putts to roll out , but they 're not rolling out			0
' watched by huge galleries , @entity2 made a fast start , hitting a superb approach to seven feet at the par - four first and rolling in the birdie putt as shouts of ' watch out , @entity2 's back ' and ' @entity80 , let 's go ' rang out			2
@entity11 , 21 , broke the 36 hole record on friday and is 14 - under - par for the tournament , 12 strokes ahead of @entity22 his only bogey came at the par - three sixth , his tee shot ending up just off the back of the green from where he had 45 feet to the flag but hit a weak chip that advanced just 20 feet			1
woods immediately rebounded in birdie - birdie style , draining a 25 - footer at the tricky seventh and hitting his third shot at the par - five eighth to two feet			0
he birdied the 11th after conjuring a moment of magic from the pine straw to the right of the fairway , a soaring approach settling 12 feet from the cup			0
' i 'm still right there , ' the 14 - time major winner said of his position going into the weekend			2
' i 'm 12 back , but there 's not a lot of guys ahead of me			0
and with 36 holes here to go , anything can happen			0

@entity0 was back at @entity1 friday to watch boyfriend @entity2 play in the second round of the masters
