the couple already own an £ 8million seven - bedroom mansion in @entity46 , but are believed to want their child , affectionately named ' @entity49 ' , to grow up in @entity9			1
but @entity3 may want to be careful about playing his particular brand of pop music out loud in his new pad - his immediate neighbour is music legend @entity53 of @entity54			2
