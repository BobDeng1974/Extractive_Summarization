@entity0 should not play in central defence again after his horror show in @entity4 's 3 - 1 defeat against @entity5 , according to former @entity7 boss @entity6			1
the @entity9 defender came off the bench in wednesday night 's @entity12 quarter - final first leg and was nutmegged twice by @entity13 in the build - up to the @entity16 's two goals			1
@entity0 suffered a hamstring injury 10 days ago but @entity6 , who insists that the @entity18 has always been a defensive liability , believes he still showed his naivety even if he was n't fully fit			1
@entity13 puts the ball through @entity0 's legs on his way to scoring his second goal of the night @entity0 suffered the same fate when @entity13 weaved his way into the box for @entity5 's second goal the @entity18 was left with his head in his hands after allowing @entity13 a clean run at goal asked about @entity0 's defending for @entity5 's third goal , the @entity33 pundit said : ' even if you 're not 100 per cent fit you ca n't show that lack of intent			1
' he 's the last man on the pitch when @entity13 picks the ball up and starts running at him			2
he realises he 's the last man and the very last thing ( you should do ) when you 're last man is jump in			0
you bide time for your team to get around you			0
' he does what an eight year old who has n't been coached does			0
he tries to win it by putting both of his feet together but when he does that he ca n't move anywhere			0
' some of @entity0 's best performances for @entity4 - and former club @entity51 - came when he was deployed in a central midfield role with less defensive responsibility , something @entity6 believes manager @entity55 should consider from now on			1
@entity33 pundit @entity6 described @entity0 as a ' liability at the back ' after @entity4 's defeat @entity0 defended like an ' eight - year - old who has n't been coached ' in this challenge , according to @entity6 @entity13 tucks home the first of his two goals against @entity4 after nutmegging @entity0 with ease he added : ' for me he 's a liability at the back			1
you have to find a place ( for him ) in midfield or even at right back			0
' he 's a footballer who likes to play in the playground when there 's no shape to the game			0
he 's a talent but that 's not what top football is about			0
' however @entity6 's fellow pundit , former @entity79 striker @entity78 , was quick to point the blame in the direction of @entity55 , who chose to introduce the 25 - year - old after an injury to @entity84			1
@entity78 said : ' if @entity0 was n't fit enough to start the game , why does he come on as a sub after 21 minutes ? @entity0 looks dejected after contributing to his side 's 3 - 1 defeat in their @entity12 quarter - final first leg @entity90 also admitted that @entity0 can be a liability but @entity78 questioned the player 's fitness ' from a coaching point of view , why would you put him in ? if he 's not fit enough to start , why do you put him in ? ' @entity96 columnist @entity90 , who was also in the @entity33 studio , showed some sympathy for @entity0 but pointed towards the sheer number of high - profile errors made by the former @entity102 man in recent seasons			2
responding to @entity78 , @entity90 said : ' i do agree with you but i 've seen him do that every single week in the @entity105			2
' that 's one of the reasons @entity51 were quick to get rid of him			0
defensively , at times , he 's a liability			2
