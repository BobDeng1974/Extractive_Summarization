when an octopus needs to make a quick escape , it propels itself through the water at speeds of up to 25mph ( 40km/h )			2
inspired by these superfast , underwater movements , researchers from @entity7 have developed a robotic version of the tentacled creature			2
complete with webbed arms and a streamlined head , the robotic octopus travels at half its 14 - inch ( 360mm ) body length every second			1
early experiments used thin , silicon arms to propel the robot through water , but the team has since added ‘ webs ’ ( pictured ) to increase speed			1
it now travels at half its 14 - inch ( 360mm ) body length per second it was developed by the @entity17 ( @entity28 ) in @entity7			1
early experiments used thinner , silicon arms to propel the robot through water , but the team has since added ‘ webs ’ between these arms to increase speed			1
the octopus uses a number of methods to explore the ocean			0
one method is similar to walking , or crawling , along the sea bed using rows of suckers on the underside of each arm			0
to move through water faster , the sea creatures expel trapped water through their funnels			0
this propels the octopus in the opposite direction , at speeds of up to 25 mph ( 40 km / h )			0
the octopus changes direction by pointing its funnel in different ways			0
the eight - armed robot was presented at the @entity59			2
the research was led by @entity61 was a finalist for two different best paper awards at the conference in @entity65 earlier this month			0
according to the team ’s tests , the robotic octopus swims at just over 3.9 inches ( 10cm ) per second when fitted with silicon arms only			1
however , adding webs between these arms increases the speed to 7 inches ( 18cm ) – or half its body length - per second			1
in addition , the robot ’s efficiency - the ratio of the energy exerted compared to the resulting speed – is improved with the webs			2
a video of the robot reveals these speed differences , and shows the robot octopus crawling through the water in a tank			2
the octopus ( stock image ) uses a number of methods to explore the ocean			0
one method is similar to walking , or crawling , along the sea bed using rows of suckers on the underside of each arm			0
to move through water faster , the creatures expel trapped water through their funnels , to reach speeds of up to 25 mph ( 40 km / h ) it also shows the robotic octopus carrying a ball , swimming in the sea , and being followed by small fish			0
as a result , the researchers claim the robot could be used to monitor fish numbers and underwater environment , in a more discreet way			1
‘ the eight - arm robot is inspired by the morphology and outstanding locomotor capabilities of the octopus , ’ explained the researchers in their paper			1
‘ underwater experiments demonstrate a novel mode of underwater propulsion by combining various patterns of sculling movements of the arms and web , and the efficiency of the swimmer , especially with the addition of the web , in terms of the attained velocities , the generated propulsive forces and the cost of transport			2
’ the paper is named ' @entity137 '			0
according to the research team ’s tests , the robot octopus swims at just over 3.9 inches ( 100mm ) per second when fitted with silicon arms only			1
adding webs increases the speed to 7 inches ( 180mm ) – or half its body length per second			1
a video of the robot also shows it carrying a ball in its arms ( screengrab pictured )			0

robot was built by the @entity17 - @entity7
it is inspired by the movement and speed of a real octopus
early experiments used thin silicon arms to propel the robot through water
the team then added ‘ webs ’ between these arms to increase speed
it now travels at half its 14 - inch ( 360mm ) body length per second
robot was presented at the @entity59 in @entity65
researchers hope the robot could be used to monitor fish numbers and underwater environment in a more discreet way
