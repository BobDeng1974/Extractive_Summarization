according to popular myth , the price of @entity1 gets more expensive every year - but this is not necessarily the case			0
a glance through a copy of the @entity1 catalogue shows that a video recorder cost a month 's average wage , while today , a decent quality dvd recorder , will set you back , approximately half - a - week 's			1
figures compiled by the @entity12 show that although prices are now more than three times higher than at the end of the 1980s , the cost of technology has either stayed relatively stable , or in many cases , fallen dramatically			0
an equivalent version today costs about £ 18.99 on the @entity30 website , although shoppers in 1982 did not get the option of @entity44			2
in 1982 a @entity21 @entity46 video recorder was a highly desirable piece of equipment as it allowed people the flexibility to record live television and return to it at a later date			2
what made it inaccessible to many , was the price of £ 599			2
in today 's money , that would be around £ 1,830			1
workers earned on average £ 136.50 , which meant that you would have to work for more than four weeks to afford the video recorder			1
today , the @entity46 recorder is no longer available following the increase in popularity of dvd systems			0
a @entity66 recorder with a hard drive can be bought for less than £ 200			0
as the average wage is around £ 480 , the new dvd machine can cost a few days ' pay - although for the true bargain hunter , simple dvd players can be purchased for just £ 30			2
for children waking up on christmas morning there was rarely a better sight than a £ 95 @entity75 ( £ 300 today ) over the years , the basic shape may be similar , and at around £ 350 , is broadly similar in price to the @entity75 a generous parent who paid almost £ 100 for an @entity75 soon realised that if they did not want to miss the next thrilling episode of @entity82 , they often had to spend a further £ 180 for a 14 - inch portable television @entity84 , of the @entity85 told @entity86 : ' the big trend over the last 30 years has been the globalisation of manufacturing			1
production that would have been done in the @entity91 , @entity92 or @entity93 has moved to the @entity94			0
that started taking prices down and it really got turbo - charged in the 90s			0
' the early 1980s led to the production of a range of electronic educational gifts for children , with gadgets such as @entity104 , worth £ 33.95 - around £ 100 today			0
now any parent can download an emulator app for their smart phone			0
however , the most envied children were those who returned to school in january 1983 with tales of a new @entity75 video games system			0
their parents had to pay £ 95 - almost £ 300 today			1
no games system was complete without a few cartridges such as these which cost around £ 25 ( £ 77 today ) meanwhile , today 's high - tech video games cost in the region of £ 50 - 60 , which is slightly cheaper than 1982 while people may remember the @entity75 , the gold standard machine of the time was the @entity125 video computer which cost £ 150 - almost £ 470 today			1
the children would quite happily plug their games system into the back of the £ 260 20 - inch colour television in the living room ( £ 800 today ) but that could cause discord			1
parents who treated their children to a video games system were often forced to buy a second television , because unless they had their rather expensive video recorder , they would miss out on the latest episode of @entity82			2
instead , many parents decided the simpler option was to pay £ 180 for a 14 - inch portable ( £ 560 today ) , which they could set up in their bedroom			1
today a @entity143 or @entity144 cost between £ 350 - £ 400 , while an 50 - inch @entity146 costs £ 499 , while a 40 - inch @entity148 led tv costs £ 199			1
in 1982 , educational toys such as @entity150 and @entity151 were very popular , but are now free mobile phone apps			0

a *ferguson* *vhs* video recorder would set you back £ 599 at @entity156
the average weekly wage was £ 136.50 , meaning the machine was one month 's pay
an @entity163 system was £ 95 which is around £ 300 in today 's money
that compares reasonably well to a £ 350 @entity143 or @entity144
but games in 1982 cost £ 25 which works out at almost £ 80 today
games for the @entity143 or @entity144 cost around £ 50 - £ 60
also families in 1982 often had to buy a second tv at £ *189* for a 14 - inch
that works out at £ 560 - which is more than a 50 - inch led tv costs today
