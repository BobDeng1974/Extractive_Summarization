by @entity0 published : 07:54 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 03:38 est , 22 october 2013 have you ever noticed how clouds , when viewed from far away , can take on shapes of familiar faces ? or how close - up microscopic images of an insect can look remarkably like space images of an alien planet ? the phenomenon is all down to how scale distorts our perception			1
without knowing how close or far away something is , nature ’s patterns can take on remarkable , and strikingly similar forms			1
two scientists have since created and collected more than 50 images for display in ' @entity21 ' exhibition which aims to challenge our perceptions of the world			1
this image is an interferogram of the @entity27 in @entity28 , showing topography , including a depression in the center of the image , caused by a sub-glacial volcanic eruption			0
it has a scale of approximately 5 km by 3 km this is something that @entity37 , a geography professor at @entity38 , noticed when he was studying vegetation on @entity41 using satellite imagery			0
in 2004 , professor @entity37 had an exhibition at the @entity45 gallery in @entity46 in which an image of the @entity49 delta was mistaken by many people as a medical scan			1
‘ at this point i started to wonder how people perceive satellite imagery , ’ he told @entity52			2
does this look more like a river or a medical scan ? during an exhibition at the @entity45 gallery in @entity46 this mirror image of the @entity49 delta was mistaken for a medical scan			1
' this is the image which began my thinking of how people perceive satellite imagery , ' said professor @entity37 without knowing how close or far away something is , nature 's patterns can take on remarkable , and strikingly similar forms			1
this image is of an emerging eye of a larval zebrafish			2
the width of the image is around 300 µm ( the same size as a dust mite ) in 2012 , professor @entity37 noticed some electron - microscopic imagery on the office walls of his colleague @entity81			0
' some of his images looked like satellite images of the @entity41 , ' he said			2
one such picture is this landsat image from @entity86 ‘ then , in 2012 , one day i noticed some electron - microscopic imagery on the office walls of my colleague @entity81 , ' he said			0
‘ some of his images looked like satellite images of the @entity41			0
' as a joke i put one of my satellite images on his door and he thought that it was an electron microscopic image created by his officemate			0
’ the scientists soon realised that there must be some recurring patterns in nature at different scales , and they started to work together to look the similarities between each other ’s imagery			1
this may look like a splattering of paint , but it is in fact @entity109 by night at a scale of around 1400 km by 900 km. @entity111 downloaded from @entity112 , and processed by @entity113 with the @entity115 software the surface of the wing of a @entity118 is shown at a width of around 3mm			0
this images was taken using colourised scanning electron microscopy the work had a difference in scale of a million times or more , with professor @entity81 ’s images showing objects millimetres and professor @entity37 ’s revealing scales in kilometres or greater			1
as reported by @entity131 in @entity132 , the two scientists have since created and collected more than 50 images for display in ‘ @entity135 ? , ’ an exhibition currently at both @entity38 ’s @entity137 and @entity139 ’s @entity138 for the @entity140			1
‘ most people had trouble determining the differences in scale and most people were only able to get about 60 per cent of the images correctly identified , ’ professor @entity37 told @entity52			1
‘ we also noticed during these focus groups that people enjoyed many of the images from an aesthetic perspective			1
’ this is an image of a variety of ice types off the coast of @entity156			0
the original images was taken by @entity158			0
' most people had trouble determining the differences in scale and most people were only able to get about 60 per cent of the images correctly identified , ' professor @entity37 told @entity52 professor @entity81 's images show objects in millimetres and professor @entity37 's reveal scales in kilometres or greater			1
this image shows the surface of a green alga , @entity168 as shown at a width of around 1mm this colourful image is a 30 arc - second @entity174 ( @entity174 ) for @entity156			0
' we also noticed during these focus groups that people enjoyed many of the images from an aesthetic perspective , ' said professor @entity37 professor @entity37 said that even biologists who do microscopic imaging and geographers that use satellite images have had trouble determining the scale of some of the images			2
the exhibition aims to be both aestically pleasing as well as challenging how people view the world on different scales			1
in addition to exploring perception , the researchers want to promote a public understanding of science and how scientists study the earth at different scales			2
‘ along with galleries in the @entity201 we hope to have international shows as well , ’ said professor @entity37			2
‘ i lived and worked in @entity204 for a year and hope to bring the exhibition to the @entity206 in the future			0
’ at approximately 60 km by 40 km , this is a landsat image from central @entity209			0
the raw data was taken from @entity211			0
the exhibition aims to be both aestically pleasing as well as challenging how people view the world on different scales the flight feather of a common grackle is shown in this scanning electron microscope image at a scale of 1mm			1
in addition to exploring perception , the researchers want to promote a public understanding of science and how scientists study the earth at different scales at first glance this might look like a cracked piece of wood			2
it is , in fact , a lens of a cow eye , which was freeze - fractured to reveal the internal structure at a width of image approximately 1.5 mm , this image shows the crystal of sodium chloride , also known as table salt			0
exhibitions featuring these images are currently taking place at the @entity137 at @entity38 and the @entity138 for the @entity140 , @entity139			0

the images , ranging from a river delta to the eye of a zebra fish , show remarkable patterns on different scales
they distort your perception of what you see and most people can only identify around 60 per cent correctly
more than 50 of these images are currently on show as part of the ' @entity135 ? ' exhibition in @entity262 , @entity201
