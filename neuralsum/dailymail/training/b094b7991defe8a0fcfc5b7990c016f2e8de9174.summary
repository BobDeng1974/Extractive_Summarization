by @entity0 published : 20:30 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 20:42 est , 2 january 2013 car insurance for young drivers could rise to more than £ 3,000 a year because of changes to how compensation is paid to crash victims			1
insurers are set to increase prices by up to 15 per cent a year – and could impose a similar rise next year , experts warned yesterday			1
hardest hit will be drivers under the age of 22 , who are statistically most likely to be involved in a serious crash			1
they already pay an average £ 2,537 a year , according to the @entity13			1
but the two rises will push this to more than £ 3,300			1
in the driving seat : the cost of car insurance is expected to rise by 15 per cent a year , with those under 22 to be the hardest hit other motorists could have between £ 40 and £ 120 added to premiums			1
the average driver currently pays £ 1,219 a year			1
parents who insure teenagers under their own policies face paying on the upper side of this bracket because insurers may view them as riskier			2
the rises will be a double blow to young female drivers who have already seen the price of their insurance jump by an average £ 300 a year because of @entity36 gender equality rules introduced in december			1
the latest increases are because insurers are passing on to drivers the extra costs from sweeping changes in the way compensation settlements are paid to serious accident victims			2
in the past two years courts have increasingly awarded annual payouts to people who have suffered serious injuries such as brain damage or paralysis in car accidents			0
judges have opted for regular payments because victims who received lump sums have been left struggling to pay for care when their cash ran out			2
another advantage of annual instalments is that they can increase with inflation or if the victim ’s condition deteriorates			0
the insurance industry claims such awards mean they end up paying more to run their businesses and have to hand on the rising costs to drivers			0
@entity68 , from the @entity69 , said : ‘ it is little surprise motor premiums are rising because insurers have been hit with a mixture of extraordinary conditions such as increased cases of fraud and whiplash claims			2
when these costs come under control , the cost to drivers will fall			0
’ @entity82 , of insurance broker @entity83 , said : ‘ motorists could see the increases coming into force from this january and we could see similar rises in future if this trend in settlements continues			0
‘ it will be a blow for young drivers and a double - whammy for young female motorists who have been already hit by the gender directive			0
’ @entity99 , director of motorists ’ organisation , the @entity100 said : ‘ millions of people rely on their cars to get to work but high insurance costs already are knocking motorists for six			0
hikes in premiums and the new gender rules could make driving all but a dream for thousands of young women			0
