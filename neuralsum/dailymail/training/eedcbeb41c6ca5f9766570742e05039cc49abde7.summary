the radical plan is the brainchild of the @entity19 , @entity2 mp , who has revealed his ambition to pioneer one of the biggest shake - ups in the history of our electoral process			1
in a speech to the @entity28 society yesterday , mr @entity2 said he will ask leading figures from @entity4 technology giants such as @entity10 and @entity9 to draw up a blueprint for the implementation of digital ballots in the @entity14			1
he will chair the first ever speaker â€™s commission on ' digital democracy ' , which has set itself the task of modernising the voting system in a bid to boost turn - out figures and make the democratic process more inclusive			1
in his speech , mr @entity2 said : ' what we are talking about here is nothing less than a @entity48 version 2.0			1
' revealing plans to heighten levels of scrutiny and accountability using technology , mr @entity2 also said a new system should include ' e-dialogue ' between mps and their constituents			2
he even hinted that a digital revolution could loosen current election timetables , seeing ballots become more frequent			0
according to the speaker 's office , the commission will ' embrace the opportunities afforded by the digital world to become more effective in representing the people , making laws and scrutinising the work and performance of government			2
' it should also consider how @entity48 can become more relevant to the increasingly diverse population it seeks to serve '			0
work will start at the beginning of next year with the aim of outlining an action plan for the implementation of the proposals by 2015			0
that deadline falls in line with the 750th anniversary of the founding of @entity48			0
inclusive : according to mr @entity2 , one of the benefits of e-voting is that it will make casting a vote more convenient for those who may not be able to easily access a ballot box the speaker plans to use the example of @entity92 to champion his cause			1
the @entity96 state was the first in the world to introduce internet voting			1
it proved a popular alternative for citizens in their 2011 ballot , with around a quarter choosing to cast their votes online			0
@entity92 are now able to vote digitally using just their national identity card			2
they can also register a vote via mobile phone with a pin code			0
the speaker said he plans to consult global internet powers such as @entity9 so that the ideas are not just those of people inside @entity115 initial reaction to the idea of internet voting in @entity14 has been luke - warm from sources inside the three major parties			1
one told the @entity122 : it may happen one day , but not yet			0
there would be big questions about security			0
our system is one of the least corrupt , but there have been a few problems with postal voting and that highlights the potential danger of moving to online			0
' but mr @entity2 said the idea of introducing the online community into the very heart of @entity138 should be ' unpredictable , potentially anarchic ' and ' quite fun			2

@entity2 mp wants *parliament* to consider ' e-voting ' by 2015
he has called upon internet giants to help draw up blueprint for change
the speaker has been *inspired* by @entity92 which allows internet voting
