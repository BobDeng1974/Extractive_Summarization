@entity1 air traffic control officials today called for technology that ground staff could use in an emergency to take remote command of a plane			2
@entity8 - @entity7 , head of the @entity10 authority , urged the aviation industry to develop the system which could help prevent a repeat of the @entity15 crash last month			1
investigators believe co-pilot @entity17 locked his captain out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane into a @entity22 mountainside on march 24 , killing all 150 people on board			1
disaster : rescue workers and debris from the @entity15 jet at the crash site near @entity30 , @entity22 call : @entity32 ( above ) , head of the @entity10 authority , urged the aviation industry to develop the system which could help prevent a repeat of the @entity15 crash last month mr @entity7 said in @entity37 : ‘ such an event might cause us to reconsider systems which would allow the control of aircraft to be taken over by personnel on the ground in emergency situations			1
’ he added that it was important to ‘ think past today 's technology ’ , explaining that such a system could be used in an emergency on the ground to take remote control of a plane and safely land it			1
mr @entity7 said that it was not the ‘ simplest solution ’ , adding that similar technology is already available for piloting drones - but it could take a decade to develop it for passenger jets			1
pilots associations are sceptical of the plans , with @entity1 pilots ' union @entity61 saying the idea of remote control from the ground could be open to abuse			0
in charge : investigators believe co-pilot @entity17 ( pictured ) locked his captain out of the cockpit and deliberately flew the plane into a @entity22 mountainside on march 24 , killing all 150 people on board tribute : flowers in front of the monument in homage to the victims of the @entity15 flight in @entity81 a spokesman said : ‘ we also have to ask whether such a solution would really be an improvement			1
after all , it 's the pilots who are sitting in the cockpit and they 're the ones with all the information			0
’ the @entity89 also urged caution			0
‘ we must act with careful consideration to ensure new safety risks or concerns are not created , such as those raised by the vulnerability of any form of remote control of a passenger aircraft , ’ a spokesman said			2
since the @entity15 crash , @entity101 airlines have implemented a rule that two people must be in the cockpit at all times and @entity1 has set up a task force with the aviation industry to consider changes to medical and psychological tests for pilots			1
commercial planes could be hacked in flight by passengers using the in - flight entertainment system to access flight controls , a @entity113 watchdog agency warned last night			1
cyber-security experts said onboard firewalls intended to protect aircraft electronics from hackers could be breached if flight control and entertainment systems use the same wiring and routers			2
a ' virus or malware ’ planted on websites visited by passengers could provide an opportunity for a malicious attack , one expert told @entity135 investigators			0
a @entity135 report identified the hacking risk as one of several emerging weaknesses that the @entity140 must address as air traffic control systems advance in technology			2
the publication said : ‘ internet connectivity in the cabin should be considered a direct link between the aircraft and the outside world , which includes potential malicious actors			0
’ @entity140 administrator @entity150 said the aviation regulator has begun working with @entity113 government security experts including the @entity154 to identify needed changes			0
‘ this threat will continue to evolve and it is something that needs to be at the forefront of our thinking , ’ he told a @entity157 oversight panel			0
politicians in @entity163 called on the @entity140 to act .			0

@entity10 urges aviation industry to develop safety system
similar technology is already available for piloting drones , but not planes
co-pilot deliberately crashed jet last month in @entity174 killing all 150 on board
