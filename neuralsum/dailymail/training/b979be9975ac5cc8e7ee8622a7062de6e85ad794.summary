by @entity0 @entity1 has called for more from his @entity3 team , warning that not one of the 90 - minute performances from his reign thus far will be good enough to overcome @entity7 on sunday			1
the highlights since he started guiding @entity3 in the right direction include back - to - back defeats of @entity11 who , when beaten 1 - 0 in @entity12 in june 2013 , were ranked fourth in the world			1
@entity3 ’s unbeaten streak stands at six matches but the national coach believes it will require something of a greatest hits compilation of their best work from the last 18 months to enable his men to stun the world champions in @entity24			1
big show : @entity3 have gone their last six games unbeaten before they face @entity7 on sunday demands : @entity3 boss @entity1 says they 'll need to combine the best of their recent efforts when asked to pick one @entity3 team display from his tenure that would satisfy his demands for the opening @entity36 test , @entity1 replied : ‘ i think i ’ll have to pick different bits out of some games			1
‘ there ’s the defensive side in @entity11 , the attacking against @entity44 , the attacking and bravery when we played @entity48			2
if i threw all that in , then i think we ’d need that			0
‘ i do n’t think there is a “ one performance ” that would give us a victory			0
it ’s elements of it all sewn in that would give us the chance			0
‘ but , even with that , what i ca n’t plan for is some brilliance from some of the @entity7 players			1
sometimes , if that happens , you ’ve just got to stand up and say : “ fair enough ”			0
’ nothing to lose : @entity1 ( right ) and @entity67 ( left ) speak ahead of the match at @entity69 if it ’s a @entity3 player who conjures a moment of such brilliance this evening , then a slot in national sporting folklore is guaranteed			1
@entity1 booked his place with a goal against @entity7 in @entity77 at the 1986 @entity78 , albeit @entity3 then conceded twice to lose			1
more recently , @entity79 and @entity80 scored in remarkable home and away performances to see off a world football superpower in @entity84			0
the stage is there for one of @entity1 ’s number to record a career highlight as @entity3 team up against the brilliant @entity92 2014 winners			1
champions : @entity78 - winning @entity95 @entity94 and @entity96 prepare in @entity24 that defining act of glory will only be possible , though , if @entity3 ’s dirty work is on a par with that which so frustrated the @entity84 twice on those nights in euro 2008 qualifying			1
‘ i think people talk about “ the goal ” , no matter what happens , ’ @entity1 said			2
‘ of course , you want to go into a big game and be the best player on the pitch but as part of a team at the same time and on a winning side			0
‘ they ’ll talk about @entity116 ’s goal , @entity79 against @entity84			0
but you ’ve got to remember that behind every individual ’s moment , the defending was phenomenal			0
‘ if you remember rightly , especially at @entity122 , the bravery and commitment the defenders showed was amazing			0
i do n’t think @entity3 had another chance at goal and i think @entity3 defended that well the @entity84 got bored			2
they had that much of the ball and ran out of ideas			0
’ it 's not too late to play @entity132 … there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			2

@entity3 play @entity7 in @entity24 in a @entity137 qualifier on sunday
@entity1 's side are unbeaten in the last six matches
@entity1 warns none of those performance are good enough for @entity7
