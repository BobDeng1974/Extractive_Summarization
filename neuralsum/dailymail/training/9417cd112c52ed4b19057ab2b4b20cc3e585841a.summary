by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 21:01 est , 22 february 2014 @entity3 : 12:45 est , 23 february 2014 @entity4 was last night accused of ‘ incompetence ’ and urged to review hundreds of payouts to victims of the @entity9 scandal after it emerged some customers could have missed out on compensation while others were paid automatically			1
mps piled pressure on the bank after an investigation by @entity17 found that some staff were given the wrong rules for awarding compensation			2
hundreds of people who were sold payment protection insurance on their @entity22 were affected by the mistake			2
@entity24 who lives in @entity25 , had @entity9 on her @entity26 but was denied a refund by @entity4 the error meant customers who happened to have been dealt with by the bank ’s @entity31 office were awarded automatic payouts , while others had to fight for compensation			1
@entity4 has insisted that nobody lost out , but now faces having to explain to mps , the @entity38 and angry customers how what it describes as a ‘ minor glitch ’ could have occurred			1
mp @entity43 , who sits on the @entity44 , said : ‘ this is a major issue			2
what @entity4 needs to do is ensure that all their customers are compensated to the maximum amount			1
they should re-examine all the cases that are affected			2
i am going to raise this with the @entity38			0
’ @entity54 , mp for @entity55 and a member of the @entity57 set up to look into reforms of the industry , added : ‘ the charge here may not involve having cost anyone money ; the charge is being incompetent			1
’ @entity4 was one of the worst offenders when it came to the mis - selling of @entity9 to people who neither asked for it nor needed it			0
tens of thousands of customers paid for cover unnecessarily and @entity4 has set aside £ 3.95 billion for compensation			1
it emerged in july last year that an office in @entity31 had been working to different rules from another four sites that @entity4 had created to handle @entity9 compensation claims			0
the @entity31 case handlers were automatically compensating people who had bought @entity9 for their @entity26 over the phone instead of deciding each case on its merits			0
a whistleblower said : ‘ when managers found out about this , they told us , “ this has happened , let ’s move forward ”			0
’ case handlers worked from an online manual which was updated across all five sites in april 2013			0
but a technical failure meant the new version did not fully upload for the @entity31 workers			1
@entity44 member @entity43 , who said : ' what @entity4 needs to do is ensure that all of their customers are compensated ' contractors became aware of the error in july 2013 after a spot - check			1
on july 29 , a manager alerted staff in an email saying ‘ an error has been made in the operating instructions ’			1
managers held a meeting and the matter was never mentioned again , according to the whistleblower			0
the revelation that the bank did not notice that it was operating a two - tier system for three months has left customers furious			1
@entity24 , 51 , was upset when , after fighting for compensation for three years , @entity4 decided that all she deserved was £ 238 , even though @entity9 had been added without her consent to her @entity26 20 years ago			2
payouts average £ 2,500 but the figure varies widely			1
‘ i am flabbergasted to think some people got their money automatically , ’ said the mother - of - two from @entity25			0
‘ it makes me feel even more angry			0
the least you expect is that everyone is treated fairly			0
’ a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ no customer has been denied redress or treated unfairly in relation to these claims , which relate to less than one per cent of @entity9 cases during a period of three - and - a - half months			0
' those customers , of which we estimate there were less than 200 , were only advantaged			2
’ a spokesman for the @entity38 said of @entity4 ’ @entity9 - handling operations : ‘ we are very closely working with their teams and understand how they are handling complaints			0

error meant that some customers had payouts immediately
@entity54 of @entity57 said : ' charge is being incompetent '
payouts average around £ 2,500 but figures range widely
