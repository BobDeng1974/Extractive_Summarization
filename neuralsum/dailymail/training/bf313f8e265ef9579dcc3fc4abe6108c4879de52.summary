the return of the ‘ archbishop of @entity2 ’ could be a blessing for @entity4 , as @entity5 will take his place in an overhauled team on saturday , full of intent and armed with a useful dose of perspective			1
as captain of @entity13 this season , the flanker has proved he is a man of consistent substance to go with the larger - than - life persona			1
now he has overcome a virus , initially feared to be meningitis , the 29 - year - old is determined to inspire @entity4 as they seek to halt a sequence of five defeats			1
@entity5 , one of three changes to the matchday squad for the @entity25 against at @entity26 , can add an edge to @entity29 ’s team			1
this is a player who can talk the talk , but he has also been regularly walking the walk of late with a strong end to last season , a fine contribution to the gallant near - miss against the @entity36 in @entity37 and a stirring start to the new club campaign			1
flanker @entity5 returns to the @entity4 line - up on saturday against @entity42 at @entity26 the ‘ archbishop of @entity46 ’ has backed up his characterful chat with performances on the pitch having been a frustrated observer in the last two weeks , as @entity4 have sunk to home defeats against @entity36 and @entity49 , @entity5 is ready to enter the fray with a clear vision of what is required			1
‘ it ’s important for us to get results on the board , ’ he said			1
‘ that ’s the key			2
we do n’t feel in crisis but ultimately what cements everything we ’re doing is results			2
no one reflects in a year ’s time and says , “ oh , that was a narrow victory ” , they just want to see a @entity67 as for the idea that , “ win or lose , they ’ve got a really good culture ” , frankly , it does n’t matter			2
‘ with all the fans that have bought into everything we ’re trying to do , you want to do them justice , you want to do yourselves justice , and you want to confirm that everything we ’re doing inside the camp is correct			2
we all know it is ; it ’s now just getting over the line and proving it			2
’ @entity5 gets down to business on tuesday as @entity4 look to stem the flow of @entity25 losses the flanker , coming in for @entity91 , says @entity4 's squad want to repay the fans ' faith 15 @entity95 ( @entity96 ) 14 @entity97 ( @entity98 ) 13 @entity99 ( @entity100 ) 12 @entity101 ( @entity100 ) 11 @entity102 ( @entity103 ) 10 @entity104 ( @entity98 ) 9 @entity105 ( @entity106 ) 1 @entity107 ( @entity96 ) 2 @entity108 ( @entity98 ) 3 @entity109 ( @entity98 ) 4 @entity110 ( @entity98 ) 5 @entity111 ( @entity112 ) 6 @entity5 ( @entity13 ) 8 @entity113 ( @entity103 ) 7 @entity114 ( @entity96 , captain ) @entity5 replaces @entity91 , while @entity116 and @entity117 have come in for @entity118 and @entity119			1
reflecting on the defeats by the @entity36 and @entity49 that have set off a wave of criticism , @entity5 added : ‘ i have been involved when we were getting beaten heavily by these sides , when a narrow loss would have been acceptable			1
‘ it is now at the stage where we should be beating these teams and be right up there			2
i do n’t think anyone is satisfied to be pushing those teams close			2
we should be beating them and we are doing everything in our power to go on and do that			0
’ but @entity5 insisted the present problems bear no resemblance to the debacle at the last @entity138 , which he was involved in			1
‘ it is the polar opposite , ’ he said			0
‘ it does n’t resemble that kind of atmosphere or situation at all			0
‘ my own view and that of the boys is that finishing an honourable second is not acceptable but let ’s get some context here			0
it was the world champions and the second - best team in the world			0
no one wants to talk about a development journey , but we are a side that has come together pretty quickly			0
@entity117 ( left ) and @entity116 ( right ) come into the matchday squad with @entity5 ‘ we have pushed some very good sides close but we are aware that we need to take that step next and take those opportunities			1
‘ we are talking about small percentages - that ruthlessness that @entity36 or the @entity163 have which has been born out of a lot of experience and a lot of games together with pretty unchanged squads			0
they are doing it consistently and that ’s what we are striving for			0
’ that is also what @entity5 has been striving for on a personal level			1
he achieved that impressive continuity prior to his virus - induced week in hospital and he has done enough since his comeback to convince the coaches that he deserves another starting shot			0
his ambition is to maximise the opportunity and that is where deeds must trump words			0
@entity5 stood up to be counted against @entity36 in the 3 - 0 series loss earlier this year ‘ you never want to be the guy who talks it up ; who trains like @entity193 , plays like @entity194 , ’ he said			1
‘ if you talk a good game , you have to play a good game			0
this is a huge opportunity for me and i want to seize it as best i can			0
i want to make sure i perform and leave nothing in the tank			0
there is never next week with international rugby because it is so competitive			0
that is my mind - set			0
’ @entity5 ’s hope is to ‘ make life difficult ’ for the coaches by playing well enough to leave them with a selection quandary			1
but in doing so , he would also be making life much easier by alleviating the pressure which has engulfed the @entity4 set - up			1
that would be a blessing for all involved .			0
