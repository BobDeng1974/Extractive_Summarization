@entity0 has often been a target of derision from @entity4 fans - but after wednesday night 's horror show against @entity6 , they may well have had a point this time			2
the @entity9 midfielder replaced @entity10 in the second half of the 1 - 0 win at @entity13 but his cameo was not a resounding success			1
the 28 - year - old - who may win his 50th cap against @entity19 on monday - has only played quarter of an hour for @entity9 in the @entity20 this season and it showed as his touch was heavy and off target			1
his attempted crossfield pass to @entity54 was not received well inside @entity13 either , with ironic cheers greeting the ball sailing out of play , miles away from its intended target			0
@entity0 has been ( unfairly ) booed on to the pitch before by @entity4 fans and is seen by many as the safe option , emblematic of @entity65 's squad			0
sadly for @entity4 this was not a rare occurrence as the squad performed drastically below par ahead of monday â€™s @entity71 qualifier against @entity19 .			0

the @entity9 midfielder replaced @entity10 in the second half
his disastrous attempt to switch play has been caught on vine
even @entity4 fans mock the misplaced pass as the ball goes out
the 28 - year - old also misplaced a corner which was *uploaded* to @entity50
