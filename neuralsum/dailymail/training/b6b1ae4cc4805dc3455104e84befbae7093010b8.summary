by @entity0 published : 22:11 est , 11 june 2012 updated : 22:22 est , 12 june 2012 after more than three decades of bitter controversy , a coroner ruled yesterday that a dingo was responsible for the death of a baby in the @entity6			1
the decision finally confirmed that a wild desert dog had entered the tent in which @entity10 and her family were staying , near @entity13 , and carried her away to her death			1
there were emotional scenes yesterday when the verdict was delivered			2
@entity20 ’s mother @entity19 , now 64 , tearfully embraced her former husband @entity21 and other family members in the courtroom			0
today a coroner in @entity28 ruled that the youngster was taken by a dingo mrs @entity25 , as she is known following her remarriage , served nearly four years of a life sentence for murder before being released after new evidence was discovered			1
in the 32 years since she cried out in the night ‘ a dingo ’s got my baby ! ’ , there have been four inquests and a government inquiry into nine - week - old @entity20 ’s death			1
but it was the verdict delivered in @entity43 yesterday that has put the seal on whether or not a dingo was responsible			2
@entity25 and @entity10 pictured shortly before her disappearance in 1980 @entity47 , the @entity48 coroner , said she was ‘ satisfied that the evidence is sufficiently adequate , clear , cogent and exact and that the evidence excludes all other reasonable possibilities ’ than that the baby was taken by one or more dingoes			1
the case , which divided @entity28 , inspired six books and a 1988 @entity58 movie @entity56 , starring @entity59 as @entity25			0
mrs @entity25 was jailed in 1982 after being found guilty of slashing her daughter ’s throat and making it look like a dingo attack			0
she was released in 1986 after @entity65 @entity64 fell to his death while climbing @entity13 – known today by its @entity68 name of @entity13 – and landed beside a matinee jacket that was vital to her defence			1
mrs @entity25 had told police that no dingo saliva had been found on @entity20 ’s jumpsuit because the baby was wearing a matinee jacket over the jumpsuit , but no jacket was found at the time the child disappeared			1
a third inquest in 1995 could not determine the cause of death			0
mr @entity83 , who was convicted of being an accessory after the fact of murder but later exonerated , then fought a long legal battle for a fourth inquest			1
that inquest heard new evidence of dingo attacks , including three fatal attacks on children since the third inquest			0
beauty spot : @entity20 was snatched from her tent at campsite near @entity13			2
her clothing was later found beside a dingo 's lair trial : @entity19 and @entity83 leave a courthouse in @entity103 , @entity28 in february 1982			1
@entity19 was originally jailed for murdering @entity10 with @entity21 given a suspended sentence for being an accessory ordeal : mrs @entity25 served six years for her murder before being acquitted in 1988			2
she had always claimed that a dingo killed their child			0
mrs @entity25 , who has two sons and a daughter who was born shortly after she started her prison term , has been spat at and abused by members of the public over the years			0
outside court , she said she was ‘ relieved and delighted to come to the end of this saga ’ and that the verdict was ‘ such a vindication ’ for her and her former husband			0
she wept when asked what she thought her @entity20 might be like if she had lived – the day before would have been her 32nd birthday			0
@entity25 and @entity83 react to the ruling			0

@entity128 served six years in jail for murdering *tot* who disappeared in the night during a camping trip to @entity13 in 1980
she and her then husband had always *maintained* that a wild dog had snatched their child
baby 's body was never found despite *intensive* searches by police , @entity68 *trackers* and park *rangers*
her clothing was later found beside a dingo 's lair at the base of the rock
*incredible* scenes as coroner fights back tears as she delivers the verdict at fourth inquest into the case
