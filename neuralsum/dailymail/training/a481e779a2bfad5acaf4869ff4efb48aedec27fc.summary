by @entity0 a policeman has been caught sipping a drink as he drives his patrol car through @entity4 - days after a young driver was given a ' ridiculous ' £ 100 fine for a very similar transgression			1
the officer was pictured driving through @entity4 today holding a takeaway soft drink at the wheel of his @entity12 car			1
a passer - by took the photograph this afternoon on @entity15 in @entity4 as the car was moving slowly through traffic			1
thirsty ? the officer with the @entity12 was pictured by a passer - by taking a drink as he drove down @entity15 in central @entity4 scene : the car was photographed moving slowly down the street while its driver took a drink it comes less than a week after 22 - year - old @entity28 found herself confronted with four officers and a police van after taking a single slurp of her raspberry @entity33			1
she was fined £ 100 and given three points on her licence after she was spotted drinking while stationary in @entity4 traffic			1
miss @entity28 , from @entity38 , @entity4 , said : ‘ it ’s so petty and ridiculous			1
it was only a tiny sip			0
i was n’t even moving			0
and talk about overkill – to have four police officers dealing with such a petty thing is a joke			2
’ however , after being confronted with their own officer 's conduct , the @entity12 have said that @entity46 was actually given the penalty for after driving without her seatbelt while using both hands to eat the @entity50			1
a spokesman said : ' a female driver was seen driving without a seatbelt and without holding on to the steering wheel			0
' she was holding a ' @entity33 ' in one hand and a straw in the other , using the straw to spoon the ice into her mouth			0
' she drove away but subsequently stopped the car in @entity62 and was spoken to by officers before being issued with a fixed penalty notice			0
' penalty : last week 22 - year - old @entity28 , pictured , was given a £ 100 penalty for sipping a @entity33 while stuck in traffic driving away : the vehicle can be seen moving further down the street through traffic and although she was met by the full force of the law for her breach , the pictured officer appears to have taken a different view of the law			1
@entity76 , 31 , an it engineer who works nearby , saw the officer after reading about miss @entity28 's fine			2
he told @entity80 : ' only a few moments ago i read an article about a driver who was fined £ 100 by police for taking a single slurp of slush at the wheel of her car			1
' to my amazement , i saw this only moments later			0
it 's not ok for us - but they can			0
' the law does not specify whether eating or drinking while driving is illegal , and whether drivers have committed by doing so depends on how it affected their driving			0
according to advice from the @entity101 , drinking a soft drink while on the road is only an offence ' if you present a significant danger ' and if the police think ' you are not in proper control of the vehicle '			2
a study from @entity111 has shown that drivers consuming drinks at the wheel went 22 per cent more slowly than average , but were also 18 per cent more likely to show erratic lane control			0
guidelines published by the @entity117 do not mention food or drink in relation to driving without due care and attention - but they mention that any act which causes a driver to be ' avoidably distracted ' could constitute an offence			2
this is in contrast to more specific laws which exist around other potential distractions such as mobile phones - the use of which attracts an instant penalty .			0
