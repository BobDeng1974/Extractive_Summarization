by @entity1 reporter @entity2 has replaced its @entity4 button with a more to - the - point ‘ @entity5 , ’ letting users block all messages and posts from selected friends			1
like the previous button , it gives users the option of blocking content from certain people without offending them , say through de-friending			1
the latter alternative severs ties with that person on the social network , without notifying them			2
this new one allows for more passive aggression			0
never do this : for demonstration purposes only , here is where to find the @entity28 button -- which lets you mute annoying friends -- on your @entity31 ‘ this means you are still friends , but updates from that person wo n't appear in your news feed			1
the goal of this change is to help people curate their newsfeed and see more of the content that they care about , ’ @entity2 told @entity32			0
the world 's largest social network is constantly tweaking its newsfeed - the main page users look at on the network - often by reducing clutter , especially from advertising , and bringing to the surface or revealing the posts deemed most relevant to any particular user			0
@entity2 began rolling out the ‘ @entity55 ’ button and a related change to its users on monday			2
it added a ‘ following ’ button next to the usual ‘ like ’ button on a page or next to the ‘ friends ’ button on a personal timeline , which will also enable users to block posts			1
dislike : when you 've read one too many updates from a @entity2 friend you ca n't stand , you may now mute them with the @entity5 button the button may be accessed by clicking a dropdown menu beside a friend ’s recent update in your newsfeed			1
when clicked , the selected update and all future correspondences from that person will placed out of sight and , thus , out of mind			0
@entity2 insists it ’s not about passive aggression , it ’s about tidiness			0
‘ the goal of this change is to help people curate their @entity31 and see more of the content that they care about , ’ a @entity2 spokesperson told @entity80 .			0

the @entity5 button replaces the similar @entity4 button , but has a less *spiteful* ring to it
