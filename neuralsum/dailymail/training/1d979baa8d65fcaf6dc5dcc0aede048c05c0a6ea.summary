one of the pleasures of travel is getting to sample the local cuisine			0
but would you tuck in to a developing duck embryo straight from the egg in southeast @entity6 ? or sip fermented mare 's milk in @entity9 ? perhaps a warming bowl of dog soup in @entity12 ? @entity13 , co-founder of @entity14 , a guide to local foods around the globe , says : ' tasting the locally distinct foods and drinks of a place is absolutely essential to a trip , as they illuminate that region ’s unique culture , history , geography , and lore			1
and seeking those foods out inevitably brings a traveler into closer contact with the local people , allowing for a richer travel experience			0
' extra protein ? @entity34 , which translates as ' white children ' is a @entity38 dish made of male fish genitalia containing sperm but not everything on the international menu screams ' eat me '			1
in @entity46 , spicy grasshoppers , known as chapulines , are a popular snack on sale at the market stalls of @entity50 , while tacos de sesos - that 's beef brain tacos to you and me , are a well - loved treat ( which comes with a @entity54 - or mad - cow disease - warming )			1
feeling thirsty in @entity9 ? the local tipple , aireg , is a fermented , alcoholic dairy drink traditionally made from mare 's milk			1
and snake wine is the drink du jour in @entity61 , @entity62 and southeast @entity6			2
produced by infusing whole snakes in rice wine or grain alcohol , the drink was once believed to have medicinal qualities			2
there 's something fishy about the @entity70 ' national delicacy			1
@entity71 , is bulging tinned herring			2
why does it bulge ? because inside the fish is slowly festering			2
and @entity76 's offering , @entity77 , is fermented shark			1
popular @entity80 delicacy , balut , is a ready - to - hatch duck embryo that is half - boiled and eaten in the shell			1
@entity84 ? ' as for how to go about finding these foods : a little pre-trip research goes a long way , ' says @entity13			0
' but on the ground , it 's as simple as asking people where they eat and what their city is known for			1
ask your cab driver , your waiter , the person next to you on the metro - anyone			2
and keep your eyes open - you can probably guess where locals versus tourists are eating by the look of a place ( and , often , the prices on the menu )			2
@entity6 is a hotbed of interesting edibles			0
deep fried chicken feet are a popular street food in @entity61 , @entity113 , @entity12 and @entity114			1

closer to home , there 's the humble haggis : a savoury pudding containing sheep 's heart , liver and lungs , traditionally cooked in the animal 's stomach			0
deep fried chicken feet anyone ? fowl extremities are common all over @entity6 , but would you indulge ? but beware of @entity148 delicacy , @entity149 , which consists of live small octopus and is best served still wriggling			1
the sucker pads on each squirming tentacle have been known to stick to the inside of diners ' throats			0
@entity13 adds : ' when trying new foods , especially if it 's from the street , use caution			0
of course , be wary of anything made with tap water , including ice , unless you ’re sure it ’s safe to drink ; same goes with raw , unpeeled produce			2
' choose established venues , or eat where lots of locals are eating , particularly women and children			0
always wash your hands before eating ; in some countries , carrying hand sanitizer or your own utensils is a good idea			0
and before you travel , check that your vaccinations are up - to - date			0
' @entity178 is a shrub commonly found in @entity179 , and a great source of carbohydrates - but if it is n't prepared properly it can contain enough cyanide to kill you			0

@entity38 dish , @entity202 , or pufferfish , contains deadly amounts of the poison tetrodotoxin			2
chefs leave just the right amount of poison in to give the diner a tingling sensation on the tongue			0
tacos de sesos , or brain tacos , a delicacy in @entity46 has a spongy texture , which is not entirely popular with tourists something fishy : @entity77 is a traditional dish and delicacy of @entity76 consisting of fermented shark spicy grasshoppers , known as chapulines , on sale at the @entity225 in @entity50 , @entity46 @entity148 delicacy , @entity149 - a small live octopus , best served still wriggling			1
