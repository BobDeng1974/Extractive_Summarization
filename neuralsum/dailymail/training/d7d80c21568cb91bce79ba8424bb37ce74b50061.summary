by @entity0 published : 20:57 est , 26 november 2013 updated : 06:08 est , 27 november 2013 prince @entity1 and his team of seriously injured servicemen have been able to travel to the starting line of their @entity6 trek after blizzard conditions left them snowed in at their base camp			1
the @entity12 teams had hoped to fit in skiing training at the starting point , which is 87 degrees south of their accommodation at @entity17 , to help them acclimatise to conditions			1
but a snowstorm and very high winds left them largely confined to their rooms			1
now , with weather conditions having improved , the prince and and his 12 colleagues have arrived at start of the first stage of the 208 mile journey			1
ice cool : @entity1 and his team were able to make the journey to the start line , 87 degrees south of their base camp at @entity33 , after severe weather conditions subsided time to go : the @entity12 team should have embarked to the start line a week ago speaking in his first interview from @entity37 , yesterday , prince @entity1 said his brother @entity38 would be jealous of his adventure , because it would mean getting away from ' a screaming child '			1
the fourth - in - line - to - the - throne also told how proud he was to be alongside such ' extraordinary ' people			1
and although the 29 - year - old prince seems to be relishing the challenge ahead , @entity1 admitted his father , prince @entity46 , has expressed his concern			2
the trek will see the team travel a distance of 208 miles , in temperatures of up to minus 50 degrees – all while carrying custom built arctic sledges known as pulks , weighing in excess of 11 stone			1
inspiring : every one of the prince 's team - mates has lost at least one limb serving in @entity61 but the prince insisted : ‘ every single person who takes part in this challenge is extraordinary			1
' the fact these guys have made it to this point is extraordinary and i count myself incredibly lucky to be part of it			2
' leading the way : during the trek , the teams will have to travel around 15km to 20km per day , enduring temperatures as low as minus @entity77 @entity1 should have embarked on the @entity78 at the weekend but has been confined to base camp due to heavy snow and winds			1
speaking to @entity83 , the prince revealed that his brother - who has been concentrating on his responsibilities as a new father - was envious of the ambitious trek			2
@entity1 said : ‘ my brother , yeah , i think he 's just quite jealous that i managed to get away from a screaming child			2
’ he said the @entity90 and prince @entity91 had taken the time to meet his @entity37 comrades - including @entity95 adventurer @entity94 - before the team set off			1
he said : ‘ what do my family think of this ? i think the last time i said , " i do n't think most of them know about it "			2
‘ obviously , i took all the guys to @entity104 to meet my grandmother and grandfather , which they absolutely loved , especially @entity94 who was very excited , which was fantastic			2
‘ my father was a little concerned , but i obviously tried to keep him calm and explain the @entity110 was the dangerous one because we 're walking on a frozen ocean whereas this time there are crevasses			2
‘ but hopefully the guides will take us around that			2
apart from frostbite you should be able to look after yourself as long as you just head south			1
’ the prince and the trek teams have been unable to fly to the second base camp because of snow storms prince @entity1 and the other @entity125 members have been snowed in at their base camp the teams , pictured skiing during acclimatisation training , have been hit by strong winds and snow storms the @entity12 hopes to raise money for injured service personnel and also to inspire others injured in battle			1
every one of the prince ’s team - mates has lost at least one limb serving in @entity61 , a statistic which clearly humbles the royal , who has been ribbed constantly about breaking a toe in the run up to their departure			1
he said : ' i obviously broke my toe hoping to get out of the trip , that was a massive fail on my part ! acclimatisation to the conditions has been hampered and the frustrated teams have been forced to rest the teams from @entity155 , the @entity156 and the @entity157 have been unpacking and repacking their kit to pass the time ' @entity160 said i really should have gone that step further and break a leg , but i chose not to			1
' my toe is now 95 per cent , so i 'm fine ... whatever setbacks i 've had is irrelevant against these guys , it was always going to be			2
' three teams – one from @entity155 , one from the @entity157 and a rival team from the @entity156 - are due to head to the start of the race tomorrow , weather permitting			1
@entity1 said : ‘ now we 're here , unfortunately we 've had really rubbish weather for the past four days which has meant a lot of lying around …			0
people pack and unpack more times ... you would not imagine			0
prince @entity1 , right , said his brother , prince @entity38 , is jealous he is undertaking the expedition the prince , pictured at base camp , said he counts himself ' incredibly lucky to be part ' of the expedition ‘ for me i 've just kept it really basic on the advice of @entity94 from last time [ when @entity1 joined part of a trek to the @entity110 ] - keep it basic and you should survive			1
‘ some of the guys have got so much comfort stuff - the @entity193 are taking bricks of butter			0
’ he added : ‘ i should be more capable than them on paper , but so far we went for one walk and everyone stuck together and it was nice to see how everyone was , some were uneasy at the start but then got it together			1
prince @entity1 is patron of @entity206 in the 200 - mile @entity12 2013 expedition team @entity206 members ( r - l ) prince @entity1 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213 ‘ @entity214 [ @entity210 , a colleague ] was always trying to convince me to go out for eight hour walks up in the hills			1
that 's fine for you i told him , because you 've got the time to			0
' if i was n't stuck in an office typing up emails or sitting in a cockpit flying around the @entity206 , i was in @entity224 doing something else , wearing a suit and tie - so it have been quite tricky ‘ but i am fit and able , i 'm 29 years old so i have no excuses so a lot of it 's up here , and with the military backgrounds we all have , it should carry it over			0
’ the prince took time to pay tribute to his colleagues , whom he describes as ‘ heroes who just wanted to be treated normally ’			0
prince @entity1 said he was determined to take part in the expedition after having to leave a similar one in the @entity110 for prince @entity38 's wedding ‘ every single person who takes part in this challenge is extraordinary			0
the fact these guys have made it to this point is extraordinary and i count myself incredibly lucky to be part of it , ’ he said			0
‘ the pressures and hurdles that these guys face , as you know , temperatures down to minus @entity251 , winds up to 70 - 90 - whatever it is - it is pretty unpleasant here			0
' just walking to and from dinner here is enough to have their eyes opened to the elements and to make you think to yourself " what have i got myself into ? " stupidity on my part ! ‘ for me being pulled out of the @entity110 [ @entity1 had to leave a 2001 expedition early to attend his brother ’s wedding ] , it was just a case of i 've just got to do this			0
me and my big mouth ! ' there was no way i could have dropped out of this , no way			0
i could n't have done it			0
and also it 's a great opportunity			0
i know it is slightly mad , but i 've got four limbs and completely fine , well , almost fine , up here			0
‘ these guys have got all these issues and life changing injuries that are really hard for them , so if i ’m given the opportunity , and it means i can actually help these guys out , creating more awareness for them or whatever , then so what to minus 50 and 90 mph winds ? occasionally you 've got to put yourself through that for a good cause			0
‘ the honour and the treat is mine to be able to spend time with these guys			0
' they 're not heroes , they do n't want to be known as heroes , they 're just people that have had life changing injuries who just want to get on with it and have as normal a life as possible from this point forward - and that 's the message we 're trying to get across to everyone else			0
‘ these wounded guys are no different and they do n't want to be treated any differently			0

the @entity12 teams were snowed in at @entity313 camp
move to second base camp 87 degrees south had been *delayed* until today
up turn in conditions enabled the team to journey to the start line today
