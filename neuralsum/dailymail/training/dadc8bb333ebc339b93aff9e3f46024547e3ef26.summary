violence : president @entity1 has been supplied with @entity3 cruise missiles @entity3 last night admitted it had defied the @entity4 and supplied @entity6 president @entity5 with a batch of cruise missiles			1
despite warnings today that the country was in civil war and ongoing concerns over terror tactics used against civilians , @entity9 will also go - ahead with training the dictator 's troops to use the state - of - the - art weapons			2
' @entity20 cruise missiles have been delivered to @entity6 , ' said an informed @entity3 source			1
a total of 72 missiles were ordered by @entity24 , but @entity9 did not make clear how many had been delivered in the recent past			2
' these arms will make it possible to defend @entity6 's entire coastline against a potential attack from sea , ' said another source			1
@entity32 fears the cruise missiles could fall into the hands of @entity36 militants in neighbouring @entity37			2
the @entity38 also sought to halt arms sales to the @entity6 ruler after his bloody crackdowns on street protests			1
@entity9 insists that a deal on the missiles and radar equipment , signed in 2007 , is legal under international law			2
with instability growing in the region , @entity9 may have calculated that by arming the dictator , it reduces the chances of @entity52 intervention in the country			2
the revelation came as the @entity56 's top human rights official warned today that @entity6 has entered a state of civil war with more than 4,000 people dead and an increasing number of soldiers defecting from the army to take up arms against the the president			1
@entity6 president @entity5 has been trying to crush an eight - month - old revolt against his autocratic rule , but the violence has only intensified			1
the @entity68 , @entity69 , said the death toll for the revolt stands ' at 4,000 but really the information coming to us is that it 's much more than that			1
' heavy arms : a cruise missile similar to those shipped to @entity6 by @entity3 takes off during a test flight in the desert ' as soon as there were more and more defectors threatening to take up arms , i said this in august before the @entity83 , that there 's going to be a civil war , ' @entity69 said , speaking today in @entity86			1
' and at the moment that 's how i am characterizing this			0
' the scathing criticism from @entity69 comes as the pressure piles on @entity5 from home and abroad			0
the @entity93 imposed fresh sanctions on @entity24 today , while the @entity6 opposition called a general strike inside the country			1
the recent spate of economic sanctions from the @entity93 , the @entity100 and @entity101 are punishing @entity6 's ailing economy , a dangerous development for the government in @entity24			1
@entity6 business leaders have long traded political freedoms for economic privileges in the country , where the prosperous merchant classes are key to propping up the regime			1
but the sanctions , coupled with increasing calls for strikes , could sap their resolve			0
demonstrators wave green , white and black flags during a protest march against president @entity1 in @entity118 , near @entity119 , earlier this week support for the regime : a @entity6 woman holds up a copy of the @entity124 next to a christian icons , during a rally against sanctions imposed against by the @entity100 the new @entity93 sanctions target 12 people and 11 companies , and add to a long list of those previously sanctioned by the @entity93			1
the full list of names of those targeted will not be known until they are published in the official journal of the @entity93 tomorrow			0
the 27 - member bloc also imposed some sanctions on @entity6 's ally @entity140 in the wake of an attack this week by a mob on the @entity144 in @entity145 , the @entity140 capital			1
@entity147 foreign secretary @entity146 accused @entity140 of supporting @entity1 's crackdown , saying ' there is a link between what is happening in @entity140 and what is happening in @entity6			1
' the sanctions came as @entity6 troops stormed a village in the central province of @entity157 , killing at least six people - the latest in what has become daily violence and bloodshed in the country			1
it was difficult to gauge how widely @entity6 were abiding by thursday 's strike , which activists announced on an opposition @entity167 page			1
the regime has sealed the country off from foreign journalists and prevented independent reporting			0
@entity6 warning : @entity56 @entity68 @entity69 residents in @entity6 's two economic powerhouses - the capital , @entity24 , and the northern city of @entity177 - reported business as usual thursday			1
but in the flashpoint city of @entity119 , a resident said that most of the shops were closed , except for those selling food			0
@entity119 has been one of @entity6 's most volatile cities , with increasing clashes between troops and army defectors			2
' few people are in the streets and only about 20 percent of students went to schools and universities , ' said one resident , who asked that his name not be made public for fear of government reprisals			0
a video posted online by activists showed mostly closed shops in the @entity24 suburb of @entity201 , which also has seen large anti-regime protests			0
despite the recent diplomatic squeeze and thursday 's strike , the government has shown little sign of easing its crackdown			0
the @entity209 activist group said security forces swept through the village of @entity212 in the central province of @entity157			0
the group said six people were killed , without giving further details			0
the @entity147 - based @entity217 also said six people were killed and nine wounded in @entity212			0
it added that the operation was continuing in the village			0
earlier today the government took local journalists on a trip to the village of @entity226 in @entity227 , where they spoke to the family of a nine - year - old boy who was shot dead in @entity119 three days ago while he was buying cookies from a shop			0
' he was holding a biscuit in his hand not a pistol , ' said the child 's mother , @entity237			0
' they have burned my heart			0
' she blamed ' armed terrorists ' for killing her son			0
the shooting is particularly resonant in @entity6 because the boy , @entity247 , was from a @entity249 family			2
@entity249 and other religious minorities in @entity6 generally support the regime because they feel it offers them important protections			2
@entity6 is overwhelmingly @entity253 , and many minorities fear they will be marginalized if a @entity253 regime takes over			2
@entity1 and the ruling elite are from the tiny @entity258 sect .			0

death toll in @entity6 *conflict* stands at 4,000
