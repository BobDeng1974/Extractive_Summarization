@entity0 has had enough of being pigeon - holed , so when he confronts @entity4 rival @entity3 on saturday afternoon , the @entity2 centre will aim to tackle the perception that he is solely a defensive force			1
the 28 - year - old has been cleared to play after missing last week ’s defeat at @entity9 with a minor calf injury			2
it is no coincidence that in his absence , his club lost			0
saracens were only beaten three times in the league phase of the @entity20 last season and each time , @entity0 was not on duty			1
he is the man who leads the line – setting the tone for the fabled ‘ wolf - pack ’ defence			2
but that is not all he does , as he has shown in a barnstorming start to this season , notable for his dynamic ball - carrying			2
there is a clear sense that the @entity4 no 12 shirt remains up for grabs and @entity0 is convinced he has the requisite all - round credentials			1
@entity0 ( c ) has made a storming start to the season playing an offensive role for @entity2 @entity0 comes up against @entity4 rival @entity3 ( @entity38 ) when @entity39 play @entity2 on saturday while @entity40 received the @entity41 for his midfield feats on behalf of @entity9 , he was replaced at half - time during @entity4 ’s last match , as they capitulated against the @entity45 in @entity46			1
@entity39 captain @entity3 was dropped after a hit - and - miss display in @entity48 , while @entity49 was also demoted but is another strong inside centre option			1
having made more appearances in that position than anyone else during @entity55 ’s tenure as head coach , @entity0 is fed up with faint praise for his defensive work			1
‘ it is something i ’m very proud of and it is a key component in a centre ’s game , but it can be a bit of a frustration because my attacking contribution can often get over-looked because of what i do in defence , ’ he said			1
‘ there have been numerous games where i ’ve made a big contribution in attack , like @entity73 last year – when i was involved in three assists for tries we scored			0
going back to our ( @entity4 ) win over @entity45 in 2012 , i contributed a try and an assist , and had numerous attacking involvements across the park			1
@entity40 ( @entity38 ) has been named @entity41 but has n't always performed for @entity4 @entity0 has played more games at centre under @entity4 coach @entity55 than any other player ‘ ultimately , i will do whatever the job requires and that is my character ; i will do whatever the team needs			1
but i do think i am very capable of providing that ball - carrying ability and distribution ability and acting as a second 10 , as well as knuckling down when the team needs me			2
i feel like i ’m in a good place in terms of my all - round role as a 12			1
’ @entity55 likes the principal of having two footballing backs who can act as playmakers , whether that is at 10 and 12 or 10 and 15			0
with that in mind , @entity0 worked hard on the @entity45 tour to enhance his kicking game and believes the results are apparent			1
‘ we have scored a few tries from situations where i ’ve put the ball on my foot and sent it behind the first line of defence , ’ he said			0
‘ that is something i did at the end of last season against the @entity116 and it is something i spent a lot of time on the tour working on with @entity120 and @entity121			0
i put a lot of emphasis on it and it ’s something i have definitely added to my game			0
’ another string to his bow this season has been a stint as stand - in captain , while @entity131 was out of action			0
‘ i have enjoyed it , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i pride myself on being ultra-competitive and being a leader			0
in difficult situations i like to think i ’m a player who stands up			0
’ @entity0 takes on @entity137 during @entity4 's @entity139 clash with @entity140 at @entity141 the @entity2 centre would like to resurrect his midfield partnership with @entity145 ' @entity144 ( c ) he will relish saturday 's intriguing duel with @entity3 , the @entity39 captain and seek to harness a fervent desire to regain his status as a fixture in the @entity4 back line			1
‘ it is something i think about every day , ’ he said			0
in the past , he has formed an effective midfield alliance with @entity144 and as the powerful @entity154 is sure to feature at outside centre providing he is fit , @entity0 is keen to resurrect their partnership , which was so instrumental in the record win over @entity45 two years ago			1
he remains in the coaches ’ thoughts and he is hopeful about his autumn prospects			0
‘ there is still a huge amount to play for at 12 , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ it is a position where there have been injuries and different people have had opportunities			0
guys have come in and come out of the team			0
the tour ended very positively for me , i had some great feedback from the coaches and i have started this season thinking it is an open door			0

@entity2 centre believes he has the all - round game to be @entity4 's @entity179
he is competing against @entity40 , @entity3 and @entity49
@entity0 wants to resurrect his midfield partnership with @entity144
he faces rival @entity184 when @entity2 meet @entity39 on saturday
