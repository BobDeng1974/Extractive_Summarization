@entity0 is currently preparing to duke it out with the @entity2 to keep his @entity4 team , but he may also soon face another legal issue - this time from the @entity6			1
that 's because @entity0 's mother and grandmother have been paying property taxes on two @entity12 residences since 2001 , even though both have been dead for decades			1
a new report in @entity15 suggests 80 - year - old @entity0 and his sister @entity16 , 73 , have kept their childhood home and a property across the street in their mother and grandmother 's names and have avoided a reassessment that would increase their property taxes by several thousand dollars			1
a new report by @entity15 finds that two property 's in @entity0 's old neighborhood - including his childhood home - are in the name of his mother and grandmother , women who have been dead for decades @entity0 's mother @entity38 gained ownership of the two properties in her divorce from @entity0 's father @entity42 in 1959 , and went on to live in one of the properties for 30 years as landlady			1
it 's unclear how , but at some point @entity48 's paternal grandmother @entity47 became the legal owner of the childhood home , though no tenants recognize her name			2
@entity0 's mother died sometime in the 80s while his grandmother died in 1966 in @entity57			1
according to @entity61 law , both women 's deaths should have been reported to the @entity62 within 150 days , so that the properties could be reassessed for market value and mostly likely , a tax increase instated			2
@entity0 's paternal grandmother who died in 1966 is the registered owner of his childhood home , pictured above @entity0 's mother @entity38 is still the registered owner on this multi-tenant building located just across the street			1
however , she died sometime in the 1980s but neither death seems to have been reported since both properties are still in the deceased women 's names			1
in 2013 , $ 603.66 was paid in property taxes on @entity0 's childhood home while $ 1,545.11 was paid on the property across the street in his mother 's name			1
neither property has been reassessed since 1978 and would be worth today a combined $ 13,000 in property taxes			1
since 2001 , @entity82 has received 49 money orders in either women 's names , paying these property taxes			2
@entity0 is worth an estimated $ 1.9billion according to @entity86 and owns hundreds of properties in the @entity12 area , from low - income apartments to the lux @entity91 in @entity92			1
billionaire : @entity0 started his career as a lawyer but made his money as a @entity61 real estate mogul			0
he owns hundreds of properties across the @entity12 area from low - income housing to hte @entity91 in @entity92 , pictured above he made headlines last month when the @entity2 banned him from the league for life and hit him with a $ 2.5 million fine for making racist comments in recordings reportedly released by then - girlfriend @entity106			1
they are also trying to force him to sell the team			0
but most tenants at the facility remember dealing with @entity0 's mother and sister as their landladies over the years			2
@entity0 's mother @entity114 was so beloved by her tenants that they let her eat their food			2
that changed with @entity114 's death in the ' 80s , when @entity16 showed up claiming the two properties were hers now			0
@entity0 's mother @entity38 won the two properties in her divorce from @entity0 's father @entity123 in the 50s			2
@entity0 himself is currently starting divorce proceedings with his estranged with @entity128 ( pictured above at a @entity4 game on may 15 , with lawyer @entity130 ) the @entity132 family , who lived at one of the properties for 30 years , was evicted in 2005 and went to court with @entity16			0
while most tenants remember either @entity114 or her daughter @entity16 as their landlady , @entity0 himself was caught on the properties a few times			0
@entity141 , @entity142 's son , remembers a day in may 2012 when @entity0 and a woman he now recognizes as girlfriend @entity106 were taking pictures of the newly - painted properties			0
former girlfriend : a former tenant remembers @entity0 visiting the properties in 2012 with a woman he now recognizes as @entity106			0
@entity106 pictured above at a night club on the night of may 17 at one point , @entity0 tried to open the gate into the backyard but @entity106 stopped him			0
' no , no , honey , you ca n't go in there			0
you need a permit , ' @entity106 said			0
' she just hugged him and kissed him ... i could hear everything , ' @entity141 recalls			0
shortly after @entity0 's visit , a for - sale sign popped up on the front lawn of own of the properties but was soon inexplicably removed .			0

@entity0 's childhood home and a property across the street are listed in his grandmother and mother 's names
both deceased women have been paying property taxes on the buildings since at least 2001 , though @entity0 's mother died in the ' 80s and his grandmother in the ' 60s
if there deaths had been reported , the homes would be reassessed and most likely a tax increase *implemented*
the combined property taxes on both properties in 2013 was about $ *2,000* but could be worth $ 13,000 combined if reassessed
@entity0 is worth a reported $ 1.9billion and owns hundreds of properties in the @entity12 area
the @entity2 is currently trying to force him to sell his @entity4 team after he was caught making racist statements
