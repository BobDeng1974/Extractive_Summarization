by @entity1 reporter published : 23:07 est , 8 september 2013 updated : 02:49 est , 9 september 2013 electronic cigarettes are as effective as nicotine patches in getting smokers to quit , according to the first study to compare them			1
battery - operated e-cigarettes look like real cigarettes and turn nicotine into a vapour inhaled by the user			2
there is little information about the possible side - effects of the nicotine but it is the tar and other toxins in cigarettes which are deadly , not the nicotine			1
new study : e-cigarettes are just as likely to help smokers quit as nicotine patches according to new research the study recruited 657 smokers who wanted to quit			1
nearly 300 were given e-cigarettes while roughly the same number got nicotine patches			2
just over 70 were given placebo e-cigarettes without any nicotine			0
after six months , similar rates of smokers – 6 to 7 per cent – managed to quit after using either the nicotine - containing e-cigarettes or patches			1
four per cent of smokers using the placebo quit			0
among smokers who had n’t quit , nearly 60 per cent of those using e-cigarettes had cut down the number of cigarettes smoked by at least half , versus 41 per cent of those using nicotine patches			2
researchers at the @entity41 at the @entity42 also found similar rates of side - effects in smokers who used the e-cigarettes and the patches			1
comparison : the study by @entity42 professors tested the efficacy of both e-cigarettes and patches the most common side effect in all groups was breathing problems			1
‘ this research provides an important benchmark for e-cigarettes , ’ said @entity56 , director of the @entity41 at the @entity42 , the study ’s lead author			1
‘ we have now shown they are about as effective as a standard nicotine replacement product			0
’ popular : smokers were big fans of the e-cigarettes with many saying they would recommend them to a friend who is trying to quit smokers were also much bigger fans of the e-cigarettes ; nearly 90 percent of users said they would recommend them to a friend compared to just over half of people who got patches			1
@entity76 , an anti-smoking expert at @entity77 , called it a ‘ pioneering ’ study and said health officials should seriously consider recommending e-cigarettes to smokers who want to quit or cut down			2
‘ e-cigarettes also have the potential to replace cigarettes as a consumer product , so their value is not just as a treatment , ’ he said			0
‘ that could stop the tobacco - related disease and death epidemic if everyone switches to a safer way of nicotine delivery , ’ he said			0
he added that although more studies were needed on the long - term safety of e-cigarettes , there were n’t any imminent warning signs			0
‘ e-cigarettes may not be perfectly safe , but even if some currently unknown risk materializes , they are likely to be orders of magnitude safer than normal cigarettes , ’ he said			0
@entity104 and the @entity105 are planning to regulate e-cigarettes as medical devices , a decision that has provoked criticism from some scientists who argue that would limit their availability to help smokers while cigarettes are not as tightly regulated .			0

a study by the @entity42 is the first to compare the two *methods* of quitting
similar rates in side effects were noted between users of e-cigarettes and the patches
