by @entity0 published : 17:55 est , 15 december 2012 updated : 03:45 est , 17 december 2012 it 's that heart - lurching moment millions of us dread			0
for a split second you stand utterly helpless as your dropped @entity6 plunges towards an unforgiving pavement			1
but now inventors have devised an unlikely answer to one of modern life ’s most expensive little mishaps – an airbag for your smartphone			0
motion - sensing technology already built into most smartphones is used to detect when it has dropped – and the mini airbag is then deployed before it hits the floor			1
the idea is the brainchild of retail and technology giant @entity23 , which has patented the protective system for mobile phones , electronic readers such as @entity23 ’s own @entity28 , computer tablets and cameras			1
this week the company won approval for the patent , which was filed in @entity34 by @entity23 ’s founder , @entity35 , 48 , a self - made billionaire who has forged a career from pioneering ideas			1
the patent reads : ‘ prior to impact between a surface and a device , a determination of a risk of damage to the device is made			1
if the risk of damage to the device exceeds a threshold , a protection system is activated to reduce or eliminate damage to the device			2
’ the patent details a system that utilises a gadget ’s built - in gyroscope , camera , accelerometers and other onboard sensors in order to determine if the device has entered an airborne state			1
if it has , the technology will release airbags to reduce potential damage – or possibly even change the trajectory of its fall by firing jets of air			2
it may sound far - fetched but there is no doubting the idea has a market , as @entity6 owners in the @entity76 alone spend tens of millions of pounds a year repairing their devices			0
@entity78 , a lecturer in science entrepreneurship at @entity80 , last night applauded the effort to try new ideas , saying : ‘ i am not sure the next phone i buy will be fitted with an airbag but we are often surprised by what ideas become successful			2
borrowed : a traditional airbag in cars is deployed upon impact , cushioning the passengers ' heads as they are thrust forward			0
the phone system hopes to use similar techniques to prevent damage to the mobile upon inevitable impact ‘ an airbag incorporated into a phone might mean the end of cumbersome cases , but it might be impractical to produce			1
@entity35 is a man known for going his own way and being successful , but i think the real question is : has he come up with this idea because he keeps dropping his own phone ? ’ and @entity107 , telecoms expert at @entity108 , said : ‘ what ’s next , smartphones with built - in parachutes ? or maybe handsets with wings and propellers ? ‘ this sounds like a feature worthy of @entity116 , codename @entity117			0
but airbags for windbags sounds like a lot of hot air to me			0
from a logistical point of view , the handset would have to be rather bulky to hide an airbag			0
’ @entity126 , a technician at @entity6 in @entity127 , said : ‘ no matter what weird or wonderful way we come up with to protect our phones , there will always be someone out there who ends up breaking it			0

system uses motion sensors to detect when a phone has been dropped
airbags and jet *streams* are then engaged , hoping to prevent impact
the patented system is the brainchild of retailer @entity23
