by @entity0 @entity2 's players have been getting to know new boss @entity3 and will be getting familiar with his personality and some of his managerial traits			1
here , @entity6 has exclusive extracts from @entity0 's explosive new book on the @entity9 which lifts the lid on the new man in charge at @entity13			0
@entity3 's march to the @entity16 semi-finals began two years ago in a cosy hotel room with a blazing log fire			1
that ’s where the new @entity21 manager held a secret meeting with a key group of players and coaching staff to write the blueprint for their @entity16 success			1
@entity29 for third place : @entity31 0 - 3 @entity21 high five ! @entity21 reach the semi-finals of the @entity16 under the stewardship of @entity3 it was a perfect match			1
the @entity9 had limped away from @entity36 after a disastrous campaign in which they had hopelessly under - achieved			2
@entity39 still had the stain on his cv of being in charge of the side that failed even to qualify for the @entity16 in 2002			1
he had been out of work , had five operations to fix a hip but at the age of 61 was determined to make a success of his second chance			0
@entity39 had to set the record straight after his ill - fated first tenure as national manager ; the team had a score to settle after @entity36			1
he wanted to hear the views of the players and , after his first training session with the national team , he set up a meeting at the @entity61 hotel in @entity62 , a regular haunt of @entity9 teams , past and present			2
‘ it was a beautiful room with a wood fire , ’ explained @entity39			2
disappointing : @entity67 ( left ) and @entity68 ( right ) played during @entity21 's poor @entity36 ‘ i had asked that they adjust the lighting			1
the chairs of the players were placed in a semi-circle , so that everybody could face each other			0
’ there were 13 in the room including @entity39			0
trusted assistant @entity78 was definitely there and key players such as @entity67 and @entity81 almost certainly were , too			0
@entity39 showed them some video clips , finishing with an interview with @entity85 just before @entity36			1
@entity39 revealed : ‘ he said that a @entity9 national team with so much quality could n’t settle for anything less than the championship			0
on target : @entity93 scores as @entity21 beat @entity31 to claim third place at this summer 's tournament @entity96 for third place : @entity31 0 - 3 @entity21 ‘ so then i asked : “ so how is it possible that things went so differently ? " ‘ that turned into a conversation of two hours but i will not say anything more about it			2
’ whatever was said , events in @entity31 two years later suggest it worked to a tee			0
