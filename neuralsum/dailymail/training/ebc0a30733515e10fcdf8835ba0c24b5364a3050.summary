@entity0 has n't felt very jolly for former public servant @entity1 after he was given a cruel ' @entity3 ' gift at an end - of - year work party two years ago			1
mr @entity1 , who was working as an economic modeller with the @entity7 @entity6 , says he was humiliated by the anonymous gift of a plastic reindeer that poo - ed chocolate pellets when its tail was pulled			1
he says the toy , presented at a function with forty colleagues from the division , ruined his public service career of 37 years			2
it came with a piece of play dough written with the words ' @entity21 's modelling kit '			0
' i remember one of the division asked me laughingly , what did i get ? and i said : " a reindeer modelling poo s * * * " and i walk out , ' he told @entity28			1
economist @entity1 was humiliated to be given a plastic reindeer that poo - ed chocolate from a @entity3 at his work @entity31 two years ago , saying ' someone was saying they thought my economic modelling was s * * * ' the economist , who had been working on financial models for aged - care , disability support and job - start programs with the department for seven years , says he has suffered psychological trauma and a loss of confidence since the incident			1
' somebody was saying they did n't like my work , they did n't understand and value the modelling , that my modelling was s * * * , ' mr @entity1 said			1
he never found out who the gift was from , but discovered through colleagues that is was someone in a more senior position in the @entity58			2
' i can accept if it had come from a person below me - and i could try to explain it and not get upset about bullying , it 's just ignorance then , ' said mr @entity1			1
' but what i 'm most afraid about is that this was a person above me , in a position of authority			0
this kind of thing is an offence to me and to the profession			0
' he said an apology from the offender would not help , the damage was done			0
' nobody talked to me to resolve the problem , some of my colleagues and friends said the person should send me an apology , but i 'm a proud a person , ' said mr @entity1			1
when mr @entity1 discovered the anonymous gift had been given by someone more senior to him in the department , he quit his job with the @entity58 and says he has suffered psychological and emotional damage since mr @entity1 returned to work in the @entity91 but said he felt uncomfortable and sad , and when a redundancy was offered soon after , he grudgingly took it			1
' even my wife , she was complaining to me about why i would so easily get bad - tempered since the day i quit the @entity58 - but i am not a person to burden other people with my problems so i did n't tell her at the time			0
' it was only after reading an article about the ' dangers ' of public service @entity0 parties , that mr @entity1 approached a journalist at the @entity106 times to tell his story			1
' i feel much relieved after speaking with the media and i received support from some of my finance colleagues			0
at least now my wife understands why i was so angry now , ' he said			0
' it 's just unfortunate that some idiot played a joke , maybe someone was jealous or thought that i was a trouble - maker but i always try to do my best			0
' mr @entity1 is not working at the moment and says he does n't know what 's next on the horizon			2
' after this event , i do n't know if i want to work with the @entity58 again			0
i want to get a job that will make use of my experience and my analytical skills in particular but i 'm not sure where			0
' he says he ca n't get away from the ' sad feelings ' that the @entity3 present left him with two years ago and hopes people will think more kindly about the office gifts they buy this year - because what might seem like a harmless joke can be hurtful .			2
