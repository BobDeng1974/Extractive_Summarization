by @entity0 published : 12:51 est , 28 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:50 est , 28 february 2014 the builder who refused to abandon his million - pound home to the floods , and instead constructed his own defences , has successfully kept the deluge at bay - as water levels begin to drop			1
@entity11 became a latter - day @entity12 after protecting his property from the water which engulfed the @entity16			1
the 40 year - old father - of - two triumphed over the elements with a seven - foot high mud dam around his four - bedroom home in @entity21 , @entity22			1
he now says that almost four weeks after he began his battle against the rising waters he feels he has won			0
mr @entity11 , who lives in @entity21 , @entity22 , said that he could now start getting back into a normal routine after the water had dropped by more than 18 inches			1
he said : ' we 've done as much as we can do so now it 's just time to sit back and relax really			2
the waters have now dropped a little bit			0
in the past week it has gone down about 18 inches			0
' there is still about three and a half feet of water left on the drive still but fingers crossed it 'll continue to go down as it has been			1
i feel like i can finally start going back to normal life - i 'm back at work again now as well which is a bit of a relief			2
' obviously we are n't really worried about the water coming up over the barriers any more because the levels have stopped rising			2
the only concern now would be if the barriers broke , because obviously they are still holding back quite a lot of water			2
' thankfully that does n't look like that will happen - it is looking strong and there are n't any cracks or anything			2
undamaged : mr @entity11 poses in his kitchen , which has remained untouched by the floods write caption here relaxed : since the waters have fallen mr @entity11 says his only concern is the huge mud barriers breaking ' we 've still got the pumps running every now and again just to make sure none of the last dregs of water get in the house			1
it 's looking positive though			0
' when flood waters started creeping towards his home , the builder used all of his resources to create a mud barrier surrounding the property			1
he wrapped the base of the house in polythene in an attempt to stop any rainwater soaking through the bricks			0
a series of pumps were also in action to remove any water breaching his blockade			2
mr @entity11 evacuated his partner @entity109 , 31 , and their two children , who are 18 months old and 20 weeks old , at the start of his battle			1
he said that although the water is still too high to move them back into the home he hopes it wo n't be long			1
mr @entity11 said : ' i have n't moved my partner and kids back in just yet , obviously we still need to use a boat to get in and out so it is n't really practical for them to be here			1
' i have managed to get out and go and see them though which was fantastic			0
they 're doing alright , they knew i had to stay here and protect the house			0
' heavy machinery : mr @entity11 hired trucks , pumps and diggers to aid in the audacious defence of his home earlier days : the waters have receded since the peak of the floods , pictured , which prompted mr @entity11 to coat his walls with polythene rising tides : this is the scene mr @entity11 had to contend with on february 7 , when the floods were worst @entity11 began building his treasured home just two and a half years ago after purchasing the four - acre plot - the highest point in @entity21			1
it was built on a spot which , according to records , has never been previously flooded - a claim which mr @entity11 can proudly maintain			1
though he has managed to keep the water out of the impressive property he says that they will still have a lot of work to do once the water disappears			0
he said : ' hopefully , if the weather stays relatively dry , the water will disappear completely and normal life can be resumed			0
' obviously the hard work has paid off and the inside of the house is still dry but we will still have a clean up operation after			0
' we will have to redo the garden and get a new driveway			0
there is still a lot to do but at least we 're not having to do anything on the inside of the house either			0

builder @entity11 , 40 , built his own flood defences rather than allow his home in @entity21 , @entity22 , to be engulfed
the inside of his *luxurious* , million - pound home has been left practically *unscathed* by the water thanks to his efforts
the father of two , who can now go back to his day *job* , hopes his wife and two young children can return soon
