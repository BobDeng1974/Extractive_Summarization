a disabled businessman has been banned from building a bungalow on his own land because his garden falls outside the village boundary			1
polio sufferer @entity5 wanted to rent out his £ 500,000 house in @entity8 , @entity9 and move into a smaller property which would be modified for wheelchair access			1
but council plans show that , while mr @entity5 's house is in the village , his garden is technically in open countryside and is therefore protected from development			1
the 63 - year - old has no use of his left leg or his right arm rejected : planning officers at @entity27 told mr @entity5 that he could n't build the proposed bungalow ( site marked in yellow ) on his property ( red ) as his garden is outside of the village boundary ( blue ) the 63 - year - old has no use of his left leg and has not been able to use his right arm since a devastating motorcycle crash in 1969			1
the grandfather - of - one planned to build and move into a specially bungalow in his 9,700sq ft garden - just yards from his own five - bedroom detached house			2
he was stunned when planning officers at @entity27 told him he could n't because the village of @entity8 's boundary line runs through the middle of his land			2
' the logic defeats me			0
how can my house be in a village yet my garden not be ? , ' he said			2
' it is a long way to another village so my garden is classed as being in open countryside			1
if it is open countryside then it ca n't be a garden but it is my garden , it is n't a field			2
' mr @entity5 moved into the house in 1993 and his garden was included in the village boundary			1
but in 1997 the council redrew the boundary line which effectively marked his land as ' open countryside ' and therefore protected from development			1
space to develop : the grandfather - of - one planned to build and move into a specially bungalow in his 9,700sq ft garden ( pictured ) - just yards from his own five - bedroom detached house the ruling means building is banned under rules to stop ' infill ' - creeping developments causing villages to merge together			2
mr @entity5 claims that while has been banned from building on the land , another developer has got the go - ahead for 100 new homes on land just yards away from the ' infill ' boundary			1
he said : ' the line zig - zags round my house yet nobody seems to be able to tell me why it could n't have been drawn a few metres the other way			0
' i asked the parish council and they said there was a consultation but there was n't a consultation with me			0
defeated : mr @entity5 , pictured outside his home , said he would not challenge the ruling legally as it would ' cost him lots and lots of money ' ' it is ridiculous			1
i have n't appealed because i was told i would have no chance because of the policy about the boundary line			2
' so much money is wasted by councils on their own salaries and things at the top			0
i do n't blame the planning officer because they are just doing their job			0
' i blame the people that made the plan and did it with very little thought other than how much is this going to benefit the council			0
' they do n't seem to look at people anymore			0
it 's a joke , houses come and go but it is residents that are important , houses do n't have feelings			0
' mr @entity5 said he always planned to build a bungalow eventually because of the injuries caused by the polio and motorbike crash , he wrote to the council in 2008 after he separated from his wife - leaving him living in the large house on his own			1
he added : ' i wrote to the council and what i got back to my astonishment was a preordained rule that there was no way i could build in my garden because of the village boundary line			1
' i went back and looked at the plans and saw the line went straight across my back garden			0
' i bought the house in 1993 and i only would have seen the @entity156 plans which it is n't on			0
' i was told categorically that the policy about village confines were instigated and used from @entity159 was told i would have been consulted but i was n't			0
' mr @entity5 said that he had expected the 100 homes nearby to receive council approval as ' @entity27 has to build so many houses in the next five years and they have n't			1
' ' the council want the houses because it increases rates , my situation is irrelevant to them , they are not bothered about me			0
' i wo n't challenge it legally because it would cost me lots and lots of money			2
' protected : this 2010 map shows the planned conservation area of @entity174 , with mr @entity5 's property marked in red			1
building is banned in open countryside to stop villages slowly merging together he added that he now might be forced to sell his property and move away , but said he did not want to leave the village where his family live			1
he said : ' all i really wanted was to build a home that would make living more manageable in future years and keep me out of hospital			2
' i hate the thought of becoming a burden on the state , but it seems i 'm being forced down that road			0
' a spokesperson for @entity27 said : ' @entity190 , which defines the confines of the village , has been in place since 1997 and no changes have since been made			0
' in recent years we have not received any planning applications nor pre-application enquiries for any development at mr @entity5 ’s property but if we do so they will be considered on their own merits			1
' we understand that @entity202 are in the early stages of preparing a @entity204 for their village and consulting residents further and if they proceed their plan will be subject to a local referendum			0
' when the @entity190 was being prepared in the mid- 1990s it went through various stages of consultation which included giving local people the opportunity to give their views on the proposals			0

polio sufferer @entity5 wanted to build home with wheelchair access
hoped to build property in the garden of @entity9 home he owns
but proposal was rejected as village boundary line cuts through his lot
it means his garden is in ' open countryside ' and can not be developed
mr @entity5 said he will not fight ruling as it would ' cost lots of money '
