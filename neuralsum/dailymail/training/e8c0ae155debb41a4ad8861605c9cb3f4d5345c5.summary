by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 21:37 est , 3 november 2013 updated : 08:01 est , 4 november 2013 famously reclusive heiress @entity5 ’s mysterious @entity4 mansion could soon air its secrets as the city implements one of her last wishes and turns the cliffside home into a public center for the arts			1
part of @entity16 ’s hotly contested $ 300m will stipulates a foundation be created and named @entity18 , after the perfectly preserved @entity20 mansion			1
now a public eager to see what ’s inside the breath - taking home may soon get its wish , so long as city officials can come up with $ 18 million @entity28 debt they ’ve inherited with the estate			1
what 's inside ? the mysterious @entity5 's @entity4 mansion sat empty for years as the reclusive heiress lived out her final years in @entity34 but could soon reveal its long held secrets frozen in the @entity20 : the public may soon finally gets its peak inside @entity18 , a home owned by the reclusive heiress @entity5 and now by the city of @entity4 , @entity41 elusive : @entity16 died in 2011 and had n't set in the cliffside mansion since the 50s , but kept it perfectly maintained throughout her life			1
her hotly contested included the home as part of the creation of an arts non-profit @entity16 , the daughter of a copper magnate , spent her final 20 years in a @entity34 hospital room , where she barely rarely spoke to family but was famous for her generosity to healthcare providers , financial advisors , attorneys , and other assistants			1
her closest confidante was an immigrant nurse from the @entity62 , to whom she left much of her wealth upon her death in 2011 at the age of 104			0
eleven lawyers battled it out over the highly unusual will — including distant relatives , her goddaughter , her nurse @entity73 and other people named in the will — till the bitter end , which finally came in september when they came to a satisfying agreement			0
under the september 24 settlement , @entity16 's goddaughter @entity78 , gets $ 3.5 million			1
another $ 34.5 million will be shared among nearly two dozen grandnieces and grandnephews or their children , many of whom said they had never met the reclusive heiress			2
the @entity87 in @entity86 , @entity86 would get a gift of at least $ 10 million , and potentially more if the sale of @entity91 's @entity90 , a painting @entity16 owned , brings in more than $ 25 million			2
but @entity16 's celebrated but largely unseen mansion in @entity4 , @entity41 , was tapped to become the home of a charitable arts organization called the @entity96 , with a bequest of at least $ 4.5 million in cash , as well as assets in the property , valued at about $ 85 million , and its contents , worth about $ 6 million , according to figures from the @entity104 attorney general 's office			1
empty mansion : @entity18 was always impeccably maintained by @entity16 and even had perfectly kept gardens and a 1933 @entity108 limousine decades after the heiress had last stepped foot in the place bittersweet : perched on the edge of the @entity113 , @entity18 will now lend its name to that non-profit and serve as its 21 , 666 square foot home so long as @entity118 comes up with a way to resolve millions in @entity28 penalties the city also inherited what a doll : @entity5 , here with her copper baron father @entity124 senator @entity16 in 1922 , was famously reclusive and spent much of the end of her life in a @entity127 playing with her multi-million doll collection worth it ? the gigantic estate has long been a staple of local @entity4 lore			1
now the town is searching for a way to keep the mansion and open it up for public use but may have to sell the place to pay the @entity28 at the time , @entity138 , the mayor of @entity4 , called the bequest ‘ an amazing opportunity to create a magnificent organization that will significantly add to our strong artistic and cultural heritage			1
’ but now , reports the @entity144 , the mystery - steeped mansion where fruit trees continue to be perfectly pruned and a 1933 @entity108 limousine sits in the driveway would act as the foundation ’s public face may be forced onto the auction block			2
@entity138 told the @entity144 that , while the taxes themselves have been resolves , penalties for @entity16 ’s delayed payments — amounting to $ 18 million — must still be paid			1
after the reclusive @entity16 died at 104 , one will specified who among her family and confidantes would receive her vast wealth while another aimed to give all her money to the arts			1
an agreement split the difference in september strange : @entity16 also shelled out millions keeping up her apartment overlooking @entity169 in @entity170 while she lived in a hospital			2
she did the same for a @entity174 estate she never even lived in @entity5 , at about age four , sits with her doll collection on the porch of her father 's mansion in @entity180 , @entity181 , in about 1910 believed to be a self - portrait , this unsigned painting shows @entity5 in her twenties			1
at a time when most women painted with pastels , @entity5 was a serious art student , mixing her own oil paints begrudging heiress : @entity16 was the youngest child of @entity190 and copper magnate @entity16 , whose money she said made it difficult for her to be happy but the mayor , who is among the only people allowed inside the 21,666 square foot curiosity where @entity138 says ‘ you could eat off the floor ’ , remains confident her already culture - rich beach town will be further enriched by the generous gift			1
‘ the possibilities are endless , ’ she said of the foundation , which @entity16 stipulated must ‘ foster and promote the arts			2
’ fascinating : @entity16 remained on the radar of an enthralled public despite going 80 years without being photographed			1
her hotly contested will , and those it named , made for juicy tabloid fodder that reignited interest in the mysterious heiress one of those possibility also happens to be the sale of the mansion , which would generate tens of millions			1
‘ not so bad , ’ @entity138 told the @entity144			0
‘ but i really do n't want to start there			0
it 's a big question mark			0
and this thing is a big deal			0
’ the mansion was n’t lived it for decades leading up to @entity16 ’s death , but she shelled out a fortune to keep up it and her other homes while she languished in a hospital bed			2
she also maintained in absentia what was her last residence on @entity170 ’s @entity231 overlooking @entity169 as well as @entity232 , in wealthy @entity233 , @entity174 , though she never even lived there			0
court documents show that the enigmatic multi-millionaire spent $ 3.745 million on the up - keep of @entity236 in the last 15 years of life			2
famously , mrs @entity5 also kept her $ 3 million collection of dolls in her @entity241 homes			2
under the final agreement , these were left to the foundation as well			0
miss @entity5 was born in @entity245 in 1906 , the youngest child of @entity124 senator @entity16 , who was known as one of the copper kings			1
he was @entity124 's second richest man in the early 1900s behind @entity249			0
he shocked the political and financial world when he was 62 by announcing he had secretly married two years earlier and that his 23 - year - old wife already had a two - year - old daughter			0
miss @entity5 became the subject of public fascination and an investigation after a century of life as a recluse			2
the last photograph was taken of her more than 80 years ago			1
# @entity260 designed and commissioned many tabletop reproductions of @entity263 buildings : castles , tea rooms , houses , temples			0
" she was just a delightful person , " says @entity268 , her go - between with the artists in @entity263			0
" she developed an incredible knowledge about the art and culture of @entity263			0
it was astonishing what she knew , all the legends and folklore			0
to me , she was the last of an era			0
" on a summer visit to @entity180 in about 1917 , @entity282 posed with daughters @entity284 , left , and @entity260 at @entity286 , the dance pavilion and family park that he built for the people of @entity180			0
the girls were about fifteen and eleven			0
