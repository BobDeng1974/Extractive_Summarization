@entity1 vice-chairman @entity0 claimed he would rather lose @entity2 for free in the summer than lose him to ‘ shambolic ’ @entity3 now			1
a deal to take the 20 - year - old full back to @entity6 was all but done at the turn of the year only for representatives of the east @entity10 club to fail to put pen to paper			2
a furious @entity0 , who believed he had secured a deal that may have risen to £ 2million , told @entity14 that the deal was off			1
‘ we ’d agreed terms with @entity21 for @entity2 to go there once the transfer window opened but unfortunately @entity23 lost his job so that fell away , ’ said @entity0 shortly before the club ’s 5 - 0 defeat to @entity17 at @entity18			1
@entity2 ( right ) has been linked with a move to a number of @entity29 clubs ‘ but prior to that @entity3 had expressed an interest so we then opened a dialogue with them			1
they made an offer which was acceptable and our representatives met with their representatives in @entity10			0
‘ the fee was agreed , @entity2 agreed personal terms through his agent and they were meant to come up on @entity40 to sign off the deal and did n’t appear			1
‘ they then said they would be up on the 4th of januray but did n’t appear so i just cancelled the deal			0
i ’m getting phone calls from @entity10 saying that they want to resurrect it but as far as i ’m concerned it ’s off			0
‘ i ’m presuming they have seen @entity2 playing against @entity49 when he did really well for a kid and have changed their mind but i have not changed my mind			0
@entity2 in action for @entity1 against @entity17 on wednesday night @entity2 has already made more than 100 appearances for the @entity1 first team ‘ i ’m not concerned about him moving in the summer under freedom of contract because we will be compensated			2
‘ i always like to deal with add - ons - and with add - ons the fee for @entity2 would have been well in excess of £ 2m			0
‘ we are sorry for the boy because he ’s not getting his big move			0
‘ i think that @entity3 are shambolic and if that ’s how they carry on their business that ’s up to them , they should do things properly			1
’ @entity2 started wednesday night ’s game at @entity18 but was part of an @entity1 side thumped by their @entity77 rivals .			2
