by @entity0 published : 07:42 est , 4 february 2013 @entity2 : 13:55 est , 4 february 2013 a dull grey line drawing , unearthed in the @entity4 , could be the blueprint for the cheap @entity6 that @entity7 has always denied it 's going to make			1
patent number 8,364,032 was filed by @entity7 with the @entity4 in february last year , and granted late last month			2
the patent covers a device with a front - facing screen , a rear - facing camera and a plastic body - with no iconic home button			1
groundbreaking : patent number 8,364,032 does n't look like much , but it could herald @entity7 's entry to the low - cost market in @entity19 flagship : @entity21 , @entity7 's senior vice-president of worldwide marketing , launched the now iconic iphone 5 in @entity24 last autumn queueing : eager customers wait to get in to a newly opened @entity26 in @entity27 - but analysts say @entity7 is missing the boat in the important @entity19 market but do n't hold your breath if you 'd like to snap up this phone : if this is indeed the cheap iphone that has been rumoured , it is likely to be for the customers in emerging markets such as @entity19 and @entity40			1
the flagship @entity6 was launched amid much fanfare at the end of last year			1
but the @entity6 's maps were a disaster			2
@entity7 had dropped @entity47 's polished and more maps app in favour of its own			0
and the problems quickly emerged , with the new maps directing drivers on to airport runways , missing churches in @entity54 , and even a missing bay in @entity56			0
chief executive @entity57 apologised , saying : ' we strive to make world - class products that deliver the best experience possible to our customers			2
with the launch of our new maps last week , we fell short on this commitment			0
@entity65 , the executive in charge of maps , was quickly fired			0
@entity7 has in the past concentrated on making expensive hardware for high - value customers , making the bulk of its profits from selling hardware			2
but analysts have said that the @entity77 firm should make a cheaper smartphone to gain more of a foothold in the important @entity19 market			2
@entity7 's grip on the smartphone market has weakened - researchers @entity81 said that in the third quarter of 2012 , it had accounted for only 14.6 per cent of worldwide smartphone shipments , down from 23 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012			0
rumours about a cheaper version of the @entity6 have been circulating for some time , and what we know from the patent application seems to fit : the plastic body mentioned in the patent would keep costs down			1
the cheaper version could be powered by the lower - cost @entity98 processor , and would n't have the very high - quality ' retina ' screen			1
a cheap @entity6 for emerging markets would be a departure from the @entity77 giant 's previous strategy			1
however , @entity21 , senior vice-president of marketing , told the @entity104 : ' every product that @entity7 creates , we consider using only the best technology available			0
' despite the popularity of cheap smartphones , this will never be the future of @entity7 's products			0
but @entity57 , @entity7 's chief executive , told the @entity19 state - run @entity113 last month : ' @entity19 is currently our second largest market			1
i believe it will become our first			0
i believe strongly that it will			0

patent application reveals the move to a cheap plastic body
low - cost @entity6 could be aimed at @entity19 *consumers*
new @entity6 could use low - cost processor
