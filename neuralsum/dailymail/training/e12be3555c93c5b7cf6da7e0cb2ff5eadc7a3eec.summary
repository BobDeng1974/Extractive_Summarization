by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 08:31 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 13:09 est , 14 august 2012 @entity3 is all but broke and will ask the court to pay for his legal defense , his attorney claims -- despite the fact that the 28 - year - old has raised nearly $ 250,000 through his website			1
defense lawyer @entity10 made the remarkable claim at a press conference on monday , where he said months of death threats have forced @entity3 and his wife to blow through most of their cash on security and day - to - day living expenses			1
mr @entity10 also said the former neighborhood watch volunteer will not use the ' stand your ground ' defense in the killing of 17 - year - old @entity24 in february -- opting instead for a traditional self defense claim			2
out of school : documents revealed that @entity3 withdrew from @entity28 about a month after the shooting @entity3 's lawyer will ask the judge to declare him indigent -- a legal term that means he can not afford the cost of his own defense			1
he $ 50,000 left from his donations and about $ 20,000 in outstanding bills , the @entity35 reported			2
' he really has to live as a hermit , unfortunately , ' mr @entity10 said			0
' he 's not doing well			0
' the defense lawyer said he has been paid ' zero ' by @entity3 and will represent him for free			2
however , @entity3 still needs to cover the cost of expert witnesses , court transcripts and a private investigator			2
court records show money has poured into a @entity47 account that @entity3 set up to raise money for his legal defense			1
in april , he raised $ 1,000 a day and $ 64,000 on its best day			1
defence : @entity3 is represented by attorney @entity10 , center , seen walking to the @entity54 donations have since slowed to a trickle			1
an interview with @entity59 commentator @entity58 and the roll out of a new website have n't increased the cash flow			0
the case , @entity3 's shooting of an unarmed black teenager at a gated community in @entity68 , @entity69 , set off a national debate about race , self - defense and gun laws			1
@entity3 claims he killed @entity24 only after he was attacked by him and feared for his life			2
supporters say he has been the target of thousands of death threats and massive unwanted media attention			0
prosecutors argue @entity3 followed @entity24 because he was black and then murdered him			0
since the shooting , @entity10 said , @entity3 has been forced to flee his home and hide out in an undisclosed location			0
this has meant he and his wife ca n't work and must live off of the legal defense fund donations , mr @entity10 said			1
court records show he and his wife spent $ 135,000 on car payments , credit card bills , cell phones , cable internet and bulletproof vests			0
the announcement about @entity3 's financial problems comes after mr @entity10 announced he would not employ the infamous ' stand your ground ' defense			1
' evidence : @entity3 has said that @entity24 broke his nose and slammed his head into the pavement , which corroborate with the @entity101 's photos from that night he said looking at the case through traditional self - defense circumstances is appropriate because the facts suggest his client could n't retreat from a beating he was receiving from @entity24			1
' the facts do n't seem to support a ` stand your ground ' defense , ' @entity10 said on monday			0
still , he did say that the defense team will try to get the case dismissed during a ` stand your ground ' hearing			1
' my concern with even calling it a " stand your ground " hearing is we need to be more realistic , ' @entity10 said			0
' i 've said from day 1 we need to wait until all the evidence comes out			0
' @entity10 said he thinks people have a perception about the law that is n't accurate			0
killed : @entity24 was shot and killed the night of february 26 in @entity68 , @entity69 , by @entity3 ' people look at ` stand your ground ' and immediately think somebody 's standing there with deadly force - be it a gun or a weapon - and having the opportunity to back up but not having the need to under the statute , ' he said			2
' i think the evidence in this case suggests that my client was reacting to having his nose broken and reacted to that by screaming out for help			0
' he was n't in position where i think there was any suggestion where he could retreat , which he is allowed to do under the statute			0
' if a judge were to side with @entity3 in a pre-trial hearing under the state 's self - defense statute , the murder charge would be dismissed immediately			1
legal battle : @entity3 , pictured right at an april 20 bond hearing , will fight the charges against him using @entity69 's ' stand your ground ' law			2
