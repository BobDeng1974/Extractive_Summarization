the relationship became even more intense when @entity11 invited @entity5 to go see a documentary about a @entity40 website			2
@entity11 , @entity5 and @entity5 's husband watched the film in january 2010 and @entity11 says the atmosphere was so ' sexually charged ' that it made her feel uncomfortable and that her relationship with the teacher ' was becoming increasingly romantic and sexualized '			2

but @entity5 published the paper without ever informing @entity11			0
sexual tension : @entity11 claims that @entity5 became so obsessed with her sex life that the stress caused her to develop an irregular heartbeat even @entity5 admitted that their relationship had become unprofessional in emails , and eventually attempted to ' conceal inappropriate messages ' by corresponding with @entity11 on her private email instead of university email			1

the stress of uncovering her own childhood *horrors* led @entity11 to develop an irregular heartbeat
she is now suing the school for $ 250,000 in damages and $ *1,000,000* in attorney 's fees
the school acknowledges many of @entity11 's claims but say they are *n't* *responsible* for her health problems

@entity11 has since transferred schools and @entity5 went to work for the @entity71 in june 2013
