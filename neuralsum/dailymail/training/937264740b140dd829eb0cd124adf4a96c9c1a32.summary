by @entity0 a 12 - year - old girl whose ear was gnawed off by a raccoon is one step closer to her dream of wearing two earrings			1
@entity8 's @entity7 was just three - months - old in 2002 when the pet crawled into her crib and chewed off her ear , nose and part of her lip			1
now after revolutionary surgery , doctors have attached a new ear which they grew on her arm			1
dr. @entity43 was the plastic surgeon who attached the man - made ear yesterday			1
he told @entity29 @entity21 was doing well and recovering in the intensive care unit			0
' first time we met her , she never made any eye contact , did not talk at all , ' @entity43 , who repaired @entity21 's nose two years ago , said			1
' in the past two years , she ’s transformed			0
she ’s got more confidence			0
' a 12 - year - old girl who was mauled by a raccoon as a baby is back at home after successfully undergoing surgery to create a new ear			1
before the complex procedure , which has only been performed twice before , dr @entity43 said he practiced on a potato			0
he told @entity62 : ' as plastic surgeons we need to think outside the box a little bit - what can we do to make a life long reconstruction for her			2
' i 've been practicing carving potato last weekend using this as a template			0
' incredible innovation : @entity7 , 12 , holds up her arm to show a fully grown ear at @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity8 , on july 9 , 2014 , days before her reconstructive surgery brave : @entity7 was just three - months - old when a pet raccoon chewed off her nose , ear and lips ( pictured in april this year ) @entity85 has undergone at least 10 operations since 2012 to restore her face			1
' the raccoon pretty much ate the right side of her face , all the way back to the ear , ' @entity21 ’s adoptive mom @entity88 told @entity29			2
' now , all she wants is to wear two earrings			0
' @entity21 was just a newborn when her 18 - year - old mother and 23 - year - old father left her home alone with the pet			2
the raccoon was thought to have escaped from its cage after a door was left open when food had been dropped in , and no one was there to save the baby when she was attacked			0
mauled : @entity21 @entity106 as a baby before and after the attack			2
her adopted parents say she is still a happy girl her great - aunt @entity88 and great - uncle @entity110 only found out about the attack with horror when they watched that night 's news bulletin			1
they gained custody of @entity21 and her brother @entity116 , who was then 15 - months - old , and they and their friends raised more than $ 10,000 to help pay for her trips in and out of hospital			1
@entity88 had to quit her job at a daycare center to look after @entity21 after doctors said she would need full time care			2
remarkable : @entity21 with her adopted mother @entity88 and dr @entity127 after he built her a new nose in a 2012 operation			0
he said this next surgery will hopefully be the last major work she has done attack : it has been a slow recovery for @entity21 , who lived for a decade without a reconstructed nose ( pictured left and right ) happy family : @entity21 now lives with ( from left ) her great - uncle @entity110 , great - aunt @entity88 and brother @entity116 @entity21 previously had a prosthetic ear fitted but it was not an ideal solution and soon became infected and uncomfortable			1
yet despite the enormous damage , there is one miracle			0
even before the extensive surgery which will grant her a new quality of life , @entity21 's hearing has been largely unaffected .			0

@entity8 's @entity7 was *disfigured* in the 2002 attack
on april 15 , doctors implanted lung cartilage shaped like an ear lobe in her arm where it grew
the man - made ear was attached to her head on thursday
