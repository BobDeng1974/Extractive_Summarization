one of the most valuable paintings found in a hoard of art looted by the @entity3 – a @entity4 valued at up to £ 60million – is due to be handed to the ex-wife of @entity6			1
sitting woman , found among more than 1,400 artworks in a recluse ’s @entity10 flat , is thought to have belonged to miss @entity13 ’s maternal grandfather , the late @entity14 art dealer @entity12			1
the news marks a change in the fortunes of @entity13 , 65 , who helped pay for her ex-husband ’s defence when the womanising @entity21 chief was accused of being a rapist			0
remarkable : a painting from @entity4 called @entity25 ( @entity7 ) - one of the previously unknown works found at @entity27 's flat - is projected on a screen during a news conference in @entity30			1
@entity31 is laying claim to it mr @entity12 , whose clients included @entity4 and @entity35 , fled @entity36 during the @entity37 , leaving many works to the @entity39			1
@entity40 , of the group @entity41 , said he was confident miss @entity13 would be given the @entity4			0
the 1,400 paintings were found last year at the home of @entity27 , 80			1
his father @entity45 had been employed by the @entity3 to sell art said to be ‘ degenerate ’			1
many were bought for a pittance from fleeing @entity51 collectors			0
in a phone call to @entity53 mr @entity40 revealed that he met with the @entity12 family on thursday and has drafted a letter for the @entity39 authorities claiming ownership of the @entity4			1
he said : ' we 're hoping that they will accept our offer of a meeting in @entity10			1
' the painting , he explained , was confiscated from @entity12 's gallery in @entity36			1
he then fled to @entity64 and upon his return to @entity36 after the @entity37 could not find the artwork			1
he was @entity4 's art dealer and so received the @entity7 directly from the artist himself , mr @entity40 added			1
it was on display in @entity36 , but it 's not likely that many members of the public ever set eyes on it			1
meanwhile , phones in the cramped @entity77 offices of the @entity78 have been ringing off the hook since @entity39 prosecutors announced what the register 's chairman , @entity81 , calls ‘ the biggest cache of illegally stored art since the end of the war			2
’ ‘ people who are registered with us have been ringing to say , ` you 're on the case , are n't you ? ’ ' @entity81 said wednesday			0
relationship : @entity31 ( right ) divorced @entity6 ( left ) the former director of the @entity21 , in march 2013 the flurry of activity follows the discovery in @entity39 of more than 1,400 artworks - some by modern masters such as @entity99 , @entity4 and @entity35 - stacked in the @entity10 apartment of an elderly man			1
for families whose treasures were stolen by @entity39 's @entity106 regime , the discovery has raised hopes - but also stirred frustration			0
citing an ongoing tax probe into the apartment 's resident , @entity39 authorities have not revealed many details about the vast majority of the paintings , drawings , engravings , woodcuts and prints they have found			2
at a news conference tuesday , officials described only a fraction of the spectacular find , including - tantalizingly - previously unknown paintings by @entity4 , @entity99 and @entity39 artist @entity127			0
that has sparked a clamor for information from art hunters , museums and the lawyers of those seeking to recover looted art. the @entity10 apartment where officials discovered the hidden @entity27 paintings a reproduction of a painting by @entity140 painter @entity139 presented during the news conference on tuesday that could be worth £ 10million treasure trove : an allegorical scene painting by @entity99 worth an estimated £ 15million had never been seen by the art world before emerging from @entity27 's collection the @entity10 trove was found in early 2012 at the home of a man whom @entity39 officials did n't name but who has been identified in media reports as 80 - year - old @entity27			1
his father , @entity151 , was an art dealer who acted for the @entity3 in the 1930s to sell art considered ‘ degenerate ’ by the regime - including @entity155 and modern masterpieces - outside of @entity39 in return for cash			1
some of the works were seized from museums , while others were stolen or bought for a pittance from @entity51 collectors who were forced to sell			0
@entity165 , director of the @entity166 in @entity167 , western @entity39 , called for an inventory of the @entity27 trove to be published online quickly so museums can find out whether their stolen works are among them			1
collector : @entity173 amassed more than 1,500 masterpieces and ordered them to be destroyed in 1945 ‘ if our works are among the discovered art , we will do everything to get them back , ’ said @entity165 , whose museum lost pieces by @entity127 , @entity177 , @entity178 and many others			2
jewish groups also have called for the works to be made public immediately			0
spokesman @entity186 said wednesday that chancellor @entity188 's government favored releasing information about works that ‘ may have been confiscated from people persecuted by the @entity3			2
’ but he gave no details or timeframe for that to happen			0
that leaves people seeking the return of artworks with no quick path to restitution			0
@entity199 , a @entity200 lawyer specializing in restitution claims , said prospective claimants should approach the @entity204 prosecutors with queries about specific works			2
she said it was vital to prove ownership of the artwork until jan. 30 , 1933 , the day the @entity3 seized power			2
any art lost after that is presumed to have been sold under pressure or seized , boosting the chances of restitution			2
others will turn to the @entity78 , which maintains a database of several hundred thousand works of stolen or missing art. the organization 's team of art sleuths , historians and legal experts was busy on wednesday trying to match works on its database with the items found in @entity39			2
@entity81 says it has already found one match - not the @entity4 - but wo n't say what artwork it is			0
although there has been criticism of the @entity39 ' delay in announcing the find , art law expert @entity232 was sympathetic			0
she said the trove is so large that it takes time to catalog the works - and ‘ it might take a decade ’ to reunite them with their owners			0
@entity39 officials say they have done preliminary work on only 500 pieces so far			0
‘ it 's like a giant game of ` concentration , ’ ' said @entity232 , head of the art law team at @entity247			0
‘ they will designate the ones that we know to exist and match those up with documentation of stolen art. those are the easy ones			0
you match up the ones you can get to first , and then you start a big detective search			0

the painting is one of many belonging to the late @entity36 art dealer @entity12 that the @entity3 stole
his *descendants* have been trying to retrieve them for decades
a lawyer representing his *granddaughter* @entity31 has put in a formal claim to @entity7 , found in the @entity10 flat of @entity27
