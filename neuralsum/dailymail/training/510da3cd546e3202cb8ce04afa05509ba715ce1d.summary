technology company @entity0 is putting its supercomputer @entity2 to work - in a robot call centre			1
the artificially intelligent computer system is taking on the role of customer service manager and will be called @entity7			1
companies will be able to sign up to @entity0 's service and its customers can then ring a helpline and complain or get help from the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) machine			1
the @entity15 invited teams to design mobile apps using @entity2 's , pictured , cognitive computing capabilities			2
the 25 finalists will now submit prototypes for judging , after which only five teams will present proposals to @entity0			2
three winners will get access to the @entity2 's developer platform customers will be able to ask the @entity30 questions by phone , email and instant messaging			1
a smartphone app called ' @entity35 ' ( pictured ) is due to launch later this year in february 2011 @entity2 appeared on @entity37 quiz show jeopardy			1
during the show , clues are given to contestants that ' require analysis and understanding of subtle meaning , irony , riddles and other language complexities ' that humans can perform naturally but computers , traditionally , do not			0
@entity2 had to be programmed to make decisions and conclusions in this way by a team of experts at @entity0			1
during the show , @entity2 was given clues as electronic texts , as they were also presented to the human contestants			2
@entity2 would then parse the clues into different keywords and sentence fragments in order to find statistically related phrases			0
the more algorithms that find the same answer independently the more likely @entity2 was to be correct			0
once @entity2 had a number of potential solutions , it was able to check against its database to make sure the answers made sense			0
@entity2 then evaluated the response and determined whether to virtually press the buzzer			0
@entity2 would then speak with an electronic voice synthesized from recordings that actor @entity76 made for an @entity0 text - to - speech program in 2004			1
@entity2 has previously taken part in @entity37 quiz show jeopardy , and has helped medical research teams diagnose illnesses in patients			0
this latest role will use the computer 's internal knowledge database to handle customer complaints			0
