@entity0 is one half of the best central defensive partnership in @entity3 and were any @entity5 club to land him they would have some player			1
think @entity8 in the @entity10 / @entity8 partnership in @entity12 ’s first spell at @entity13			2
@entity14 is @entity15 's @entity10 – the brave leader heroically throwing himself in front of shots , sliding into tackles and heading in set - pieces - while alongside him @entity0 is the cool head			1
he is the perfectly positioned partner who often goes unnoticed because he barely puts a foot wrong			0
you do n’t need the dramatic lunge if you are always in the right place at the right time			0
no you do n't ! @entity15 central defender @entity0 holds off @entity13 striker @entity26 this season key man : the @entity28 has been important for @entity29 during their @entity31 title last season most commentators in @entity34 believe @entity0 has been the best defender in @entity31 this season and no one can quite understand why both he and his @entity15 team - mate @entity37 have been left out of the @entity39 squad			1
six times @entity40 faced @entity0 this season and the @entity43 failed to scored , played out of the game by the 29 - year - old who was consistently voted best defender in @entity28 before @entity47 helped bring him to @entity15 from @entity48 in january 2011			1
as well as being impeccable defensively he knows how to get forward and score important goals , giving @entity15 the @entity51 last season by notching the winner at the @entity53 against @entity54			2
the fact that his outstanding displays have caught everyone ’s eye this season extends to @entity34 coach @entity60			0
the @entity62 - winning manager enquired over the defender ’s international status			0
unfortunately for @entity34 , he had already played full internationals with @entity28 and ca n’t follow @entity66 in making the switch to @entity34			0
he did move back to @entity28 with @entity68 in 2006 after ill - fated one - season spells with @entity70 and @entity71 .			2

@entity28 centre - back has had an outstanding season at the heart of @entity15 's title - winning team
has formed a *sublime* defensive partnership with @entity14
the 29 - year - old has been *linked* with a move to @entity83
his laid back style would be well *suited* to the @entity5 *giants* of @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity13 and @entity90
@entity0 played in @entity93 final defeat against @entity54
his laid back style has been *likened* to former @entity13 defender @entity8
@entity83 's @entity40 failed to score against him in six matches this season
