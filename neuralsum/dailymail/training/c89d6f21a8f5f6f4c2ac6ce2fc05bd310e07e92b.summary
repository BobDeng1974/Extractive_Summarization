weighing 107 kilograms and chowing down on a greasy breakfast , @entity0 watched as her grandmother begged for more time to live from her deathbed			1
at 29 - years - old , the @entity7 mother - of - two from @entity5 in the @entity6 , remembers this moment as the day her whole life changed			1
' i was with her at the hospital when the doctor told her she was passing away , ' mrs @entity0 told @entity13 of her grandmother @entity14			1
' she had always managed her diabetes , but the doctor was saying " this is the last of your life , your body wo n't be able to recover , your organs are shutting down "			2
@entity0 , 29 , ( pictured finishing @entity23 's @entity22 ) transformed her life one and a half years ago after losing 32 kilograms the mother - of - two was inspired by her grandmother @entity14 , who died of diabetes in january 2013 ' she begged and bargained with him for her life			1
she definitely was n't ready to go and wanted more time in life and it just made me feel so guilty			0
' i was throwing my life away and she was begging for hers and i felt extremely embarrassed and shameful			0
ten months after her grandmother passed away in january of 2013 , the 29 - year - old shed more than 30 kilograms from her frame as she forced herself to run from power - pole to power - pole in her tiny town			1
' to start off with , i could n't run one hundred metres – on that same path now , i 'm doing 20kms regularly , ' mrs @entity0 said			1
' back then , i thought that the posts were 200 metre apart so i thought , " ah yeh , i 'll go half way "			0
turns out there 's only 100 metres between the posts			0
' mr @entity43 , who weighed 107kg at the time , listened to ms @entity14 beg for more time on her deathbed since her grandmother passed away , mrs @entity0 has transformed her life as running became easier , mrs @entity0 would walk the 2.6 km to work each day , ' cleaned up ' her eating and soon found herself working as a casual group fitness trainer alongside her full time job as a @entity52 youth worker			1
she also signed herself up for the @entity53 , set up to ' promote healthy lifestyles to @entity56 and @entity57 peoples ' and beat almost 120 people for a spot on the 12 person squad			0
since running with the group , mrs @entity0 says she has realised that running is her ' niche ' , as she continues to be the first in her team to finish each event , including : a 10km @entity67 run , @entity23 's @entity22 , a 21km half marathon at the @entity69 and a 30km event in @entity71			2
' it feels so good , i 've never felt so alive or been this skinny in my entire life			0
it 's important for someone like me to show people that no matter wherever you came from or how big feel , you can train your body to do amazing things , ' mrs @entity0 said			2
the @entity52 youth worker ( left ) joined the @entity53 , a group that promotes healthy lifestyles to @entity56 and @entity57 peoples unable to run for more than 50 metre at a time , she began by training her self to run between the power - poles in her tiny home town of @entity5 in the @entity6 ( left )			2
she now runs up to 20km at a time ' i 've got a three - year - old ( @entity89 ) and a 10 - year - old ( @entity90 ) , and that 's why i wanted to do it because , being @entity7 , i do n't think of myself as an individual – i am my family and then my roots , @entity96 and @entity97			1
' i 'm not just stopping myself from being the diabetic hat trick , i 'm changing my families lives as well			0
' a lot of @entity7 women in @entity5 ask me how i lost weight and when i first started running , i was the only @entity7 woman running in town - now they 're all walking and pounding the pavement			1
' we [ @entity7 people ] are predisposed for some of the worst chronic illnesses out there and we are so community oriented , we need strong mums – they are the fabric of families and teach the kids – if we go back – we could turn around whole lives			0
the next stop for mrs @entity0 ( far left ) is the @entity118 where she 'll run the @entity120 's 42.195km for the first time on sunday alongside her @entity53 team - mates ( pictured ) awarded by @entity123 for being the first to finish the @entity69 half marathon , mrs @entity0 said she believes she 's found her ' niche ' in running mrs @entity0 said that it was her family , three - year - old @entity89 , 10 - year - old @entity90 and her husband @entity126 who push her to keep going			1
' being indigenous , i do n't think of myself as an individual – i am my family ... i 'm not just stopping myself from being the diabetic hat trick , i 'm changing my families lives as well , ' she said the next stop for mrs @entity0 , whose hometown of @entity5 only has one set of traffic lights , is the @entity118 where she 'll run the @entity120 's 42.195km for the first time on sunday			1
' the @entity120 will be my first official marathon			0
i 'm a long distance runner for sure , i 'm not a sprinter			0
i have the same pace for 10 , 20 and 30 km races so i 'll stick to my pace until the end			0
' the last 12km will be all mental determination , but i 'll keep running for my family and my people – i 'll be the first @entity96 and @entity97 to run any marathon			2
' but when life settles back to normal again , mrs @entity0 ca n't wait to get back to the dusty @entity5 track , in the early hours of the morning before her family has woken up for the day			2
' three jobs and two kids , i just love it because it gives me that time for myself , ' mrs @entity0 laughs .			0
