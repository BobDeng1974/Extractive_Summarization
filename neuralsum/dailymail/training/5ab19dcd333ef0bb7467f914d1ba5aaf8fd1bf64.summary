at least six ‘ ghost ships ’ packed with hundreds of migrants have been abandoned to their fate by traffickers in the @entity4 during the past month , it emerged yesterday			2
the @entity8 coastguard rescued 450 migrants yesterday – many of them women and children – who were on board the @entity13 , a 50 - year - old cargo ship designed to transport cattle			1
it came just 48 hours after six officials were dropped on to the deck of another ship , the @entity20 , packed with nearly 1,000 @entity21 and @entity23 migrants that had been ‘ locked ’ on a crash course with the @entity8 coast			1
the ships – with their human cargo often cramped on deck in bitter cold and with few supplies – are fixed on a ‘ crash course ’ with the @entity8 coastline , their engines locked or simply allowed to drift towards land			0
it is seen by the authorities in @entity8 as ruthlessly exploiting the cancellation of @entity53 , a search and rescue response to migrants , that has seen 100,000 rescued in the last year by @entity8 ships			1
previously , smaller quicker boats that could evade patrols were used but now with the number of searches reduced , larger older ships often written off as not being seaworthy are being employed by the smugglers			0
the @entity64 - flagged , 240ft livestock carrier , @entity65 was found drifting without power about 40 nautical miles off the southern @entity8 coast with 450 people on board , including several pregnant women			1
it had been put on a collision course for the @entity8 coast but ran out of fuel , officials said			0
‘ we know that it left from a @entity79 port and was abandoned by its crew , ’ coastguard spokesman @entity76 said			0
‘ when we hailed the ship to ask about its status , a migrant woman responded , saying , “ we are alone and we have no one to help us ”			0
’ for the @entity91 coastguard vessel , @entity88 , which was leading the @entity65 ’s rescue , it was the fifth time it had been involved in the rescue of an abandoned vessel since it was deployed to the area at the beginning of december as part of a @entity99 replacement of @entity53			1
@entity8 coastguard officers were lifted on to the ship by helicopter and managed to pass a tow - rope to the crew of the @entity88			1
engineers were also lowered by helicopter to ensure the @entity65 was safely steered to port			0
when the coastguard rescued 1,000 migrants on board the @entity20 it was believed the crew had left the @entity114 - registered ship , but it is now thought they may have tried to slip in to @entity8 by pretending they were migrants			1
four @entity21 , aged 30 - 46 , have been arrested after investigators intercepted @entity119 and @entity120 messages that they had allegedly used to arrange the voyage , sources told @entity8 newspaper @entity122			1
two other alleged traffickers have also been identified but are yet to be arrested			0
messages between the alleged crew dating back to december 15 show they always planned to impersonate fellow passengers before slipping away , investigators say			0
the migrants made the reservations on @entity119 then paid the equivalent of between £ 3,250 and £ 4,500 for the trip once they had arrived in @entity79 , they told authorities			1
the @entity137 refugee agency says that last year 165,000 seaborne migrants had arrived in @entity8 by november 2014 and a further 40,000 in @entity139			2
this compared with 60,000 for both @entity8 and @entity139 in 2013			0
at least 4,000 have died this year in the waters off the coast of @entity143 having been placed on overcrowded boats			0
the war in @entity21 has meant the numbers fleeing for @entity99 have risen dramatically , overtaking the numbers of @entity148 , @entity149 , tunisians and other nationalities seeking a new start			2
both boatloads abandoned to their fate this week were made up of those fleeing @entity21 .			2
