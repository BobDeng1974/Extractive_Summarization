it is one of the key bonding experiences for a mother and child : breastfeeding			0
so lesbian partners @entity5 and @entity7 wanted to share that with their first - born @entity9			1
they both nurse their one - month - old daughter			1
phenomenon : @entity7 , 25 , nurses her daughter @entity9 despite not giving birth both breastfeeding : her wife @entity5 , 26 , naturally lactates meaning they can both nurse their first - born dubbed ' co-nursing ' , the little - known practice requires @entity7 , who did n't give birth , to induce lactation and take a natural drug to boost breastmilk			1
according to the new parents , it has changed everything			0
' it is so worth it for the closeness i feel with @entity9 , and also for the sanity - saving it provides both of us , ' graduate student @entity7 , 25 , told @entity33 from the family 's home in @entity36 , @entity37			1
' we both feel pretty amazed			0
' it 's amazing to see what our bodies can do , and we felt lucky to have this additional bonding experience available for both of us			0
' the couple , who married in 2012 , discovered the treatment - more common among adoptive families - in a group for lesbians trying to conceive and immediately agreed to pursue it			2
@entity7 followed a program named the @entity52 protocol , which made her body simulate pregnancy			1
starting four months before the birth , she took birth control pills and a breastmilk - enhancing drug called @entity58			1
the drug does not yet have @entity61 approval but is prevalent in @entity62 , some @entity64 states , and @entity65 , where @entity5 and @entity7 eventually bought their dosage			1
experience : the couple from @entity36 , @entity37 , said it has made them stronger as a family journey : @entity7 ( right ) started taking birth control pills and a drug called @entity58 four months before @entity5 ( left ) gave birth to @entity9 on november 7			1
they conceived using artificially inseminated donor sperm @entity7 stopped the birth control pills six weeks before @entity5 's due date , to make her body believe she had given birth , and started ' pumping ' up to six times a day			1
the pump is designed to make a woman 's body produce more milk			0
by the time @entity9 was born on november 7 , @entity7 was ready to nurse			1
she will continue with @entity58 and herbal tablets called ' @entity88 ' until @entity89 is no longer breastfeeding			0
' our friends are fascinated by the fact that my wife and i both breastfeed our daughter , ' @entity5 , a 26 - year - old nurse , said			1
' we get a lot of : " wow , that 's amazing ! " and " i did n't know that was possible ! " ' it came after a long battle to conceive			0
@entity5 endured a year - long battle with endometriosis and ovarian cysts that threatened to affect her fertility			1
in spring this year , she was finally able to undergo an intrauterine insemination ( @entity106 ) to implant a donor 's sperm in her uterus			2
but it took ten cycles before the pregnancy test flashed pink			0
' it was a heart wrenching time and very hard on us both , ' @entity5 said			2
' every cycle and negative test was harder than the last , and the doctors were less and less hopeful			0
birth : having followed the meticulous program , @entity7 was able to nurse @entity9 as soon as she was born @entity121 : they celebrated the birth at their family home and say they are already easing into their nursing routine ' our positive pregnancy test came just in the nick of time , and we were so glad			1
' now , four weeks after their home birth , photographed by @entity133 , @entity5 , @entity7 and @entity9 are easing into their unconventional routine			1
for @entity9 , it means she does n't have to wait around - even though she is sometimes stubborn ( ' she really makes us work for it ! ' )			2
' we do n't really have a set schedule or rotation , ' @entity7 said			2
' whoever is near the baby or holding her will feed her , and the other will try to pump then or shortly after			0
' ' we are able to sleep in longer chunks due to this , since it 's not all on one mama to have to feed her and stay awake			0
we switch whenever the awake mama feels like she needs help or sleep			0
' makes everything easier ! both nursing , it means either can respond to @entity9 's cries if the other is busy but the crucial benefit is their connection			2
@entity7 said : ' for me , i am able to feel even closer to her			2
' i am absolutely in love with her and feel incredibly connected to her ever since she was in utero , but since she 's been out of the womb and i 'm breastfeeding , i feel even more connected			0
' i know other non-carrying lesbian mothers who feel like they are not as close to their child as the mom who carried the baby , and i know that breastfeeding has helped me feel incredibly bonded to her			0
' when she is breastfeeding and falls asleep on me or lays her hand on me , i feel an overwhelming amount of love for her that i would n't have were i not breastfeeding			0
