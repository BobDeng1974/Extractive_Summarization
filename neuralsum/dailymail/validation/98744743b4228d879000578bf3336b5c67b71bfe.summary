children of smokers may be up to four times more likely to develop heart disease later in life			2
and the dangers still exist even if smokers try and limit their child 's exposure to secondhand smoke , researchers warn			1
therefore , the only way to protect children is to not smoke at all , they say			1
the findings confirm previous research that linked tobacco smoke and toxins with a lasting effect on children 's cardiovascular health			1
the new research confirms tobacco smoke and toxins have a lasting effect on children 's heart health @entity27 children were measured for their exposure to passive smoking and whether their carotid arteries - the blood vessels that carry oxygen - rich blood to the head , brain and face - had become narrowed or blocked due to plaque build - up in adulthood			1
plaque buildup is made up of fatty deposits and other cells that can build up in the walls of the arteries over time , making them thicker ( and therefore harder for blood to flow ) as plaque continues to build , it can actually narrow or begin to clog arteries			0
this slow plaque buildup in arteries over time is a progressive disease called atherosclerosis			0
the study involved children whose blood samples were taken in in 1980 and 1983 as part in the cardiovascular risk in @entity56			0
in 2001 and 2007 , ultrasound readings of their carotid arteries were taken			0
then in 2014 , @entity27 researchers measured the participant 's childhood blood cotinine levels from samples collected and frozen in 1980			2
cotinine is a biomarker of passive smoke exposure			2
the researchers found that 84 per cent of children from households where neither parent smoked had non-detectable cotinine levels in their samples			0
however , only 62 per cent of children from households where one parent smoked and 43 per cent of children from households where both parents smoked had blood samples with non-detectable cotinine levels			0
the dangers still exist even if smokers try and limit their child 's exposure to secondhand smoke , the researchers warn			1
therefore , the only way to protect children is to not smoke at all the risk of developing carotid plaque in adulthood was almost two times ( 1.7 ) higher in children who had one or both parents who smoked , compared to children of non-smoking parents			1
and the risk was elevated even if parents tried to limit their children 's exposure , warned the study , published in the journal @entity100			1
children whose parents smoked but did n't limit exposure had almost twice the risk - and those fiull exposed had four times the risk , the study found			2
study author dr @entity108 , of the @entity109 , said : ' although we can not confirm that children with a detectable blood cotinine in our study was a result of passive smoke exposure directly from their parents , we know that a child 's primary source of passive smoke exposure occurs at home			1
' for parents who are trying to quit smoking , they may be able to reduce some of the potential long - term risk for their children by actively reducing their children 's exposure to secondhand smoke , by not smoking inside the home , car , or smoke well away from their children			1
' however not smoking at all is by far the safest option '			0
repeated exposure of children to secondhand smoke is child abuse , a leading doctor has warned			1
@entity139 , a professor in family medicine , says exposure is as abusive as leaving children unattended in hot car , or drink driving			0
he claims he was forced to speak out after caring for ' too many children hospitalised with asthma and pneumonia , caused in large part to their repeated exposure to secondhand smoke '			2
dr @entity151 argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse his controversial opinion piece has been published in the latest issue of the @entity160			1
in it , he argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse			2
' but what if the substance is secondhand smoke ? , ' he asks			0
dr @entity139 , who is director of the tobacco intervention programs in the @entity172 , says the damage from smoke is ' as abusive as many other commonly accepted physical and emotional traumas of children '			2
his comments come after years of caring for children who have suffered severe respiratory illness due to secondhand smoke exposure			0
in the opinion piece , he writes : ' scientific research over the last decade has increasingly demonstrated that exposure to secondhand smoke is not simply a nuisance ; it is deadly			0
' secondhand smoke exposure causes multiple diseases in children , including asthma and pneumonia , and results in thousands of avoidable hospitalisations			0
' it is a major cause of sudden infant death syndrome and may cause lung cancer and heart attacks with repeated exposure			0
he argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse ' no safe level of exposure exists ' [ therefore ] , purposefully and recurrently exposing children to secondhand smoke - a known human carcinogen - despite repeated warnings , is child abuse			1

the dangers still exist even if smokers try and limit their child 's exposure
the only way to protect children is not to smoke at all , say @entity27 *experts*
study confirms tobacco toxins can *permanently* damage child health
comes as doctor said passive smoking should be *classed* as ' child abuse '
