the @entity0 may seem a surprising location to discover a woolly mammoth skeleton , but @entity4 fossil hunters have hauled ancient bones from its depths			1
when the creature was alive 40,000 years ago , the now watery expanse was a low - lying stretch of icy tundra			1
the group of archaeologists , salvagers and palaeontologists trawled the waters off the east coast of @entity17 at a depth of 100 feet ( 30 metres )			2
employees of the company , based in @entity35 in the @entity4 , search for remains of extinct animals in the dark depths and in 2010 discovered bones belonging to an 11ft ( 3.4 metre ) tall woolly mammoth			2
they collected its skull , tusks and other large bones , and filled in any missing ones with finds from similar beasts discovered nearby of a similar age , to form a complete skeleton after months of work			2
salvagers collected the mammoth 's skull ( pictured left ) , tusks and other large bones from the bottom of @entity0 , which 40,000 years ago would have been an icy tundra , connecting @entity57 to @entity58 ( pictured right ) ice age find : carbon dating tests revealed that some of the bones belonged to a mammoth that roamed @entity65 - a former landmass in the southern @entity0 that connected @entity57 to mainland @entity58 - around 40,000 years ago			1
its impressive tusks are pictured during the @entity60 , when mammoth roamed the @entity74 , lots of water that now makes up seas and oceans , was locked up in glaciers and huge sheets of ice , so sea levels were lower than they are today			2
the @entity0 did n’t exist at all and the @entity79 was a tributary of the ancient @entity82 @entity81 , which ran down the middle of what is now the @entity85			2
a vast tundra stretched between @entity57 and @entity58 in an ancient landmass known as @entity65			2
it looked a bit like northern @entity90 , with green shoots poking though snow in winter , when it was cold and barren			0
to cope with such conditions , mammoths had six inches of fat and fur as long as three feet in places			0
they shared the land with bison and wolves , as well as other megafauna			0
in the spring , the ice melted a little , revealing rich pastures that attracted herds of grazing animals			0
because of the low sea levels , antelope and ancient deer , for example , could migrate from what is now mainland @entity58			0
' it took a couple of trips			0
we started with the skull and then found little ones to replace those that were missing , ' he explained			0
they also uncovered bones belonging to woolly rhinos and @entity124 elks , plus a prehistoric skull of a @entity58 bison , also known as a @entity127 on the @entity0 bed			1
carbon dating tests revealed that some of the bones belonged to a mammoth that roamed @entity65 - a former landmass in the southern @entity0 that connected @entity57 to mainland @entity58 - around 40,000 years ago			1
' in the @entity60 , lots of water from the sea became great ice sheets and the land between the @entity4 and the @entity139 was joined up , so megafauna could just walk around			0
' when they died , their skeletons remained there so it 's quite common to find extinct bones in the @entity0 , ' he explained			1
the mammoth would have eaten vegetation on the low - lying tundra			2
at the time of the last glacial maximum , 18,000 years ago , sea levels were 340ft ( 120 metres ) lower than they are today			0
mr @entity23 said it is ' extremely rare ' to find mammoth skulls and large bones on the seabed			1
the place to be : the bones were pulled from the sea near the port of @entity17 in the @entity4 ( mapped )			2
mr @entity23 explained that lots are found because large ships leaving and entering the bustling port disturb the sea bed , making bones easier to find roaming the tundra : the mammoth would have eaten vegetation on the low - lying tundra			1
the land mass altered according to climate changes from dry and icy to marsh			0
an illustration of the @entity60 giant is pictured a rare discovery : @entity23 , who works at @entity24 , said it is ' extremely rare ' to find a complete mammoth skeleton on the seabed			1
here , amateur palaeontologist @entity182 and mammoth expert @entity181 examine bones collected on a boat trip in the @entity0 ' but it 's quite common to find something			1
most fishermen have found extinct bones [ near @entity17 ] by dredging and they 're more likely to find something than not , ' he said			1
' they often dump the bones back in the sea '			0
he explained that his fisherman father - in - law started collecting these bones at a young age and has amassed a large collection			2
mr @entity23 said : ‘ most weeks we go to the fishing ports to meet the fishing vessels and buy the fossils they caught			0
a vast icy terrain : the area was a low - lying expanse of icy tundra when mammoths roamed the @entity74 , much like parts of @entity90 today ( pictured ) catch of the day : the salvagers managed to piece together the entire mammoth skeleton after initially discovering the skull ( pictured ) and tusks of the animal in 2010 ‘ sometimes we charter a boat of our own and go for special “ fossil hunting ” expeditions			1
‘ because we see so many fossils we work very closely with the leading experts in the field , such as @entity181 , who is the world 's leading authority on mammoths			0
‘ we have assembled a number of complete skeletons of mammoths , something very few companies in the world can do ’			0
they have also found parts of sabre - toothed tigers , the skull of a woolly rhino and the cranium of a reindeer			1
something to chew over : mr @entity23 told @entity26 : ' most fishermen have found extinct bones [ near @entity17 ] by using dredging and they 're more likely to find something than not , ' before adding that discovering large mammoth bones are ' extremely rare			1
' here , a salvager holds part of a mammoth 's lower jaw while mr @entity23 told @entity26 that the mammoth is perhaps the team 's most impressive discovery , they found a ' wonderful fragment of lower jawbone from a sabre - tooth tiger			1
' it does n't look like much , but then we had it carbon dated			0
' the bone is 20,000 years old , making it one of the youngest found in the area , causing experts to re-think when the creature became extinct in @entity58			0
' it proves the animal was there much longer than thought , ' he said			0
' it 's not as impressive [ looking ] as the mammoth , but it 's more scientifically interesting			0
' large clean - up operation : the salvagers managed to piece together the entire mammoth skeleton after initially discovering the skull and tusks of the animal in 2010			1
here , an expert cleans mammoth molars another bid discovery : the team also found bones belonging to woolly rhinos and @entity124 elks , plus a prehistoric skull of a @entity58 bison ( pictured ) , also known as a @entity127 on the @entity0 bed			1

skeleton 's *composed* of mammoth bones found *offshore* of @entity17
@entity291 was an expanse of icy tundra when mammoths roamed the @entity74
' @entity65 ' let prehistoric creatures roam what is now the @entity0
salvagers said it 's common for fishermen to find ancient bones in the area
but discoveries of large skulls and *leg* bones are ' extremely rare '
bones from sabre - tooth tigers and ancient bison have also been found
