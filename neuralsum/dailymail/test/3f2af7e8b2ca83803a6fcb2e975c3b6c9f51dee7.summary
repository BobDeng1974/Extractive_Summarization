a bloodstained document revealing a life - or - death episode that could have derailed the whole @entity3 space programme of the 1960s is tipped to sell for £ 80,000 ( $ 120,000 )			2
the splatters of blood on the checklist for the very first @entity3 spacewalk were from an astronaut as he frantically battled to close the hatch door of the spacecraft after a historic venture			1
but the @entity14 mission of june 1965 ultimately proved successfully , and paved the way to astronauts walking on the moon for the first time four years later			1
a complete 13 - page checklist , including a bloodstained document seen at the front ) , from the @entity14 mission in june 1965 is tipped to sell for a huge £ 80,000 ( $ 120,000 )			1
the list shows the various steps the astronauts had to go through when opening and closing the hatch to space @entity14 launched from @entity28 in @entity29 on 3 june 1965 with two astronauts on board			1
one , @entity32 , was tasked with performing the first @entity3 spacewalk , less than three months after @entity35 @entity34 had completed the first spacewalk in history			0
the two astronauts on the @entity14 mission were @entity40 and @entity32			1
the @entity42 programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the @entity48 missions			0
the first crewed @entity42 flight , @entity49 , lifted off @entity50 19 at @entity28 in @entity29 on march 23 , 1965			0
@entity52 's two - man @entity42 spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule 's orbit , remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft			1
they also pioneered rendezvous and docking with other spacecraft			0
all were essential skills to land on the moon and return safely to @entity63			2
they orbited @entity63 66 times over four days and , on the first day , @entity32 donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule			1
he spent 20 minutes in space on the spacewalk , or extravehicular activity ( @entity71 ) , before having to come back in , which he said was ' the saddest moment of my life '			0
but the hatch to get out had proved difficult to open and it was equally difficult to close when @entity32 was back inside			2
it 's thought one of them cut their hand or finger on the hatch locking mechanism and their blood ended up on the checklist after they removed their gloves while safely inside			1
had the pair not been able to lock the hatch after themselves , they would n't have been able to re-enter @entity63 's atmosphere and would have been lost in space			1
and had that worse case scenario happened , it could easily have scuppered the @entity48 missions that followed including the first of the moon landings four years later in 1969			0
@entity95 , pictured , became the first @entity3 astronaut to perform a spacewalk on 3 june 1965			2
he spent 20 minutes in space , and said coming back in was ' the saddest moment of my life '			0
as it was the first spacewalk , there were a number of complications			0
@entity32 used a small jet propulsion unit to move around in space the two astronauts on the @entity14 mission were @entity40 and @entity32			1
they orbited @entity63 66 times over four days and , on the first day , @entity32 donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule			1
shown is the first page of the checklist ( left ) and the @entity116 ( right ) for the spacecraft the @entity42 programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the @entity48 missions			2
on the left is part of the checklist used for leaving the spacecraft , and on the right , part of the checks the astronaut leaving had to go through @entity52 's two - man @entity42 spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule 's orbit , remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft			1
pictured is the later @entity139 in orbit , as seen from @entity141 during a rendezvous mission in december 1965 checklists from space missions are said to be highly collectable items because they flew in space and were so vital to the astronauts			2
the spacewalk checklist for the @entity14 mission of 1965 belonged to @entity40 who gave it to a friend after signing it many years ago			1
the document is now being sold at auction to mark the 50th anniversary of the historic mission			0
@entity157 , of auctioneers @entity158 which is selling the item , said : ' the @entity14 mission was the first time [ an @entity3 ] walked in space and it was a huge step in the development of the space programme			1
@entity14 ( pictured ) launched from @entity28 in @entity29 on 3 june 1965 with two astronauts on board shown are astronauts @entity95 ( left ) and @entity40 , command pilot for @entity14 ' we knew we could get into space but until this point we did n't know if we could walk and float around out there			1
@entity40 and @entity32 's achievement is second only to landing on the moon			0
' the checklist was vital for making sure things did n't go wrong and they did n't get sucked out into space			0
' they had a difficult time in getting back in the capsule afterwards as the hatch got stuck			0
there was a problem with the latch on the hatch			0
it was a really scary , life or death moment			0
' if they had n't been able to get the hatch closed they would have died in space			0
it would have been the first major space programme disaster which could have jettisoned the whole space programme			0
' the auction takes place on april 24 in @entity197			2
the @entity42 ( illustrated ) was fairly cramped , leaving the astronauts little room to move around this fantastic shot shows @entity32 floating above the curvature of @entity63 with the hatch seen open on the right			2

a piece of space history is going up for auction in @entity197 this month
it is a bloodstained checklist from the @entity14 mission in 1965
this spacecraft orbited @entity63 66 times with two astronauts on board
blood came from astronaut 's hand while trying to close the hatch in space
