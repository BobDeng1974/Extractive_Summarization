@entity0 are considering a £ 7million swoop for @entity3 defender @entity2 in an attempt to solve their defensive headache			1
speaking at thursday 's @entity8 , manager @entity7 confirmed he will look to sign a central defender in january			1
and @entity10 is emerging as a prime contender amongst the @entity13 hierarchy			0
@entity14 could be on his way for @entity0 for £ 7million ... the @entity13 failed to sign him in the summer @entity7 is looking for defensive cover and admitted he will sign one player in january @entity18 ( 2010 - 2013 ) games 62 goals 7 @entity3 ( 2013 - present ) games 42 goals 5 @entity0 looked into the prospect of signing @entity10 , 23 , on transfer deadline day but could n't get a deal over the line			1
but the @entity13 are set to revive their interest in january as they look to bolster their defensive options @entity0 have nine first - team players unavailable for tomorrow 's clash against @entity31			2
@entity7 's biggest concern is in defence , with @entity34 ( @entity35 ) , @entity36 ( ankle ) and @entity38 ( suspended ) all unavailable for the repeat of last year 's @entity41 final			1
@entity34 's long - term fitness is major concern			2
the @entity35 injury is a long - standing problem , which has deteriorated in recent weeks			0
' it has got worse , he finds it difficult to play with at the moment , ' said @entity7 , who insisted @entity50 international does not require surgery			2
' if you wait for it to be better , it can be a short time			0
if you want to get rid of it completely , it is long term			0
' we will monitor him and as soon as he can take enough pain again he will play			0
' @entity34 will be out of the game against @entity31 this weekend with a mysterious achilles problem @entity65 defender @entity38 is unavailable for the game against @entity31 due to a suspension the fear is @entity34 's injury could manifest itself into a problem that could see him miss months rather than weeks , leaving @entity7 with the dilemma of whether to hand @entity34 an extended break in hope that the @entity35 does not become a serious hinderance or continue playing the @entity50 and risk aggravating the injury further			1
@entity34 's absence means @entity7 is almost certain to use left - back @entity77 as a makeshift central defender alongside @entity80 against @entity31 in a back - four that could also consist of rookie right - back @entity81 and @entity83			1
@entity84 to search for defensive cover			0
