it was a trend started by @entity2 ’s hiring of @entity3 and we see its ultimate manifestation in the fascinating sub-plot to sunday 's men ’s @entity8 final			1
@entity10 and @entity11 faced off 35 times in their career , with three of those being on this very same occasion			1
now the rivalry rekindles itself by proxy , with their respective coaching charges @entity20 and @entity21 going for the ultimate prize			1
it is a sweet coincidence that this will also be the 35th meeting between this afternoon ’s finalists , although their career record against each other ( 18 - 16 to the @entity29 ) is much closer than the 25 - 10 superiority of the @entity31 over the @entity32			2
a quarter of a century on , @entity11 barely looks a day older than he did then , that sublimely easy mover who could glide to the net as if his feet never touched the ground , so often delivering a beautifully executed volley to win the point			1
he has lived an uncomplicated , low - profile existence since and is said to have multiplied his fortune from tennis by working as a high - end financial planner for himself and others			2
@entity10 has had a far more complex existence in both his business and private lives , and middle age is a more obvious intruder on his much larger frame			1
‘ @entity11 was my biggest rival , ’ said @entity10			1
‘ always a nice guy off the court but a very difficult opponent on it			0
he always had such control of himself and was such a great natural athlete			0
in some ways losing that 1990 final was one of the most difficult matches to get over in my career			2
in these matches , we can give our players some of the things we learned from our experience			0
’ incredible : @entity21 will play his 25th @entity38 final on sunday @entity2 ’s partnership with @entity3 has spawned a host of copycat arrangements			1
@entity85 quarter - finalist @entity84 , for example , works with his compatriot @entity86 , and @entity88 ’s rising star @entity87 is with @entity89			0
in all cases the modern - day players are seeking to garner that little bit of stardust from those they once idolised			0
@entity21 has described @entity11 as his boyhood hero , and this year it has been clear that the @entity32 has acted as extra inspiration — hard to find when you are a 32 - year - old who has won 17 major titles and has nothing to prove			1
the key to @entity21 ’s longevity is quite simple : he loves the game as much as he ever did and the @entity32 , now 48 , is part of that , as is the challenge of doing it with a large , young family in tow			1
‘ @entity11 is clearly a piece of the puzzle but then so is my fitness trainer and @entity114 ( @entity115 , his longstanding general coach and confidant ) , and everybody around me , ’ said @entity21			1
‘ they make it possible to wake up every morning motivated , healthy , fit and eager to play			0
‘ the fun for me is being able to do it at this age			0
i know so many people on the tour after being on it for so many years and travelling on it is still something i really enjoy			0
it ’s the whole package			0
you ’ve got to love the game because if you do n’t , it ’s too hard to keep going			0
’ focus : @entity21 ( left ) and coach @entity11 ( right ) take part in a practice session on court four @entity21 is a month away from his 33rd birthday			1
we should enjoy him while we can because even he can not keep going for ever			0
it is hard to imagine him going all the way at any other @entity38 but a key this fortnight has been that he has got through his matches relatively quickly and that they have been on what is , for the body , the most forgiving of @entity145 on grass , where his ability to come forward is most rewarded , can you look at this match - up and struggle who to pick as favourite			0
do not believe that there is anything other than a massive incentive for @entity21 to win			1
aside from wanting to prove wrong those of us who believed 2012 would be his last @entity38 title , it is a priceless , and possibly last , opportunity to add to his tally			0
with @entity161 on 14 slam titles but aged 28 , it could be very tight who ends up with the most , and one more for the @entity29 might yet make all the difference			0
there is also not a great deal of love lost between @entity21 and @entity20 , the 27 - year - old @entity168 who hardly lacks for motivation either			1
experience : @entity172 2 @entity20 will contest his eighth @entity38 final for such an incredible competitor it is remarkable that @entity20 has lost five of his last six @entity38 finals , and he is without a major title since the @entity179 18 months ago			2
his most lacklustre display in all of those was probably this time a year ago , although he faced an inspired @entity2 at the height of his grasscourt powers , plus the whole of the @entity185			1
@entity21 is certain to be the huge sentimental favourite again today , and the crowd support could be a factor again			2
and do not underestimate how important this is for @entity10			2
his appointment last december was greeted with much scepticism , and with @entity20 ’s other coach @entity192 absent ( he wants to travel less ) the @entity31 has been running the show			0
for @entity10 , a @entity20 victory would represent quite a comeback in itself			2
helping hand : @entity20 of @entity168 talks with his coach @entity10 during a practice session on saturday			2

@entity10 and @entity11 faced off 35 times , three times at @entity8
*djokovic* and @entity21 will meet in a final for the 35th time at @entity205
