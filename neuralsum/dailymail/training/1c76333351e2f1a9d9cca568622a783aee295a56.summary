by @entity0 published : 07:15 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 10:22 est , 25 january 2013 at first glance it looks more like smoke - stained debris from a house fire than a component from a $ 200 million passenger jet			0
but this burnt out battery from a @entity10 airlines @entity9 which caught fire at @entity12 in @entity13 earlier this month could hold the key to a technical problem which has grounded the entire multi-billion dollar fleet			1
experts from the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) have disassembled the device in a bid to discover the cause of the malfunction - but admitted yesterday they are no closer to reaching a conclusion			0
the battery has been taken apart by experts in a bid to work out what went wrong the @entity18 said yesterday night that its investigation into the incident on january 7 is still in its ' early stages			1
' @entity9 ’s fleet was grounded by the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) just over a week after the fire in @entity13 , following a similar incident on board a 787 in @entity10			1
@entity52 , head of the @entity18 , described the incident in @entity13 as a ' very serious air safety concern ' , and that the body does ' not expect to see fire events onboard aircraft , ' according to the @entity58			0
meanwhile , batteries expert @entity59 , who worked for @entity61 for 40 years told @entity63 news that from what he knows about the incidents on board the @entity9 787s he would ' not fly in a @entity9 tomorrow			1
' ' i just would n't feel that it was appropriate or safe , ' he said			2
burnt out : the battery shows evidence of short - circuiting and a chemical reaction which can cause progressively hotter temperatures , federal accident investigators said probe : @entity18 investigators and metallurgists examine parts of the disassembled battery which have been laid out on a table detailed : a member of the @entity18 investigation team examines pieces of damaged electrode coils from the battery the @entity18 said that despite establishing that the lithium - ion device suffered a short circuit it still has to ' figure out why these events occurred			1
' the revelation is more bad news for @entity9 as it means the worldwide fleet of @entity32 remains grounded			1
the @entity25 plane caught fire while sitting on the tarmac at @entity12			2
in a separate incident on january 16 , an @entity94 flight made an emergency landing in western @entity10 after a cockpit message warned of battery problems and a burning smell was detected in the cockpit and cabin			0
an investigator in @entity10 at the time said the burned insides of the plane 's lithium ion battery showed the battery received voltage in excess of its design limits			0
concern : @entity18 chairman @entity112 speaks during a press conference at the @entity28 in @entity29 , yesterday incident : a 787 made a landing in @entity116 after a burning smell was also detected in its cockpit			0
both all @entity119 and @entity25 have grounded their entire @entity9 fleets hopes : visitors admired the first production model of the @entity9 when it was unveiled to an audience of several thousand at @entity9 's assembly plant in @entity126 , @entity29 technology : spectators reach out to touch the fuselage of the first production model of the @entity9 when it was launched			1
the jet was plagued with manufacturing delays and cost overruns since then , all 50 787s that @entity9 has delivered to airlines ' fleets have been grounded , and the manufacturer has halted deliveries of new planes until it can address the electrical problems			1
@entity143 air safety bosses acted just hours after @entity144 ’s @entity48 ( @entity48 ) issued an ‘ @entity145 ’ to halt flights of the planes - the first time a fleet of aircraft was been grounded across the world in 34 years			2
@entity9 said lithium ion batteries ' best met the performance and design objectives of the 787 ' and that ' based on everything we know at this point , we have not changed our evaluation , ' @entity63 news reports			1
complex : parts for the flagship craft are constructed by firms around the world out of service : one of @entity164 six 787s sits on the tarmac at @entity166 in @entity167 the @entity9 is the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium - ion batteries			2
they charge faster and can be better moulded to space - saving shapes compared with other aeroplane batteries			0
the battery fire is just one of a series of problems - including two fuel leaks , a wiring problem , brake computer glitch and cracked cockpit window – to afflict the 787 which got off to a bad start when launched three years late			0
@entity183 , chief engineer on the 787 , said earlier this month that the plane 's batteries have operated through a combined 1.3 million hours and never had an internal fault			0
he said they were built with multiple protections to ensure that failures ' do n't put the airplane at risk '			0

burnt out shell of battery from @entity25 @entity9 revealed
investigators have taken device apart to figure out what went wrong
batteries expert says he ' would not feel safe to fly in a @entity9 '
