far - flung family members , co-workers and friends frantically used social media , cellphones and even a @entity6 ' people finder ' website to try to learn the fate of participants and spectators at the @entity11			1
the search was made more difficult because heavy cellphone use caused slow and delayed service			1
in an age connected by everything digital , the hours after the blasts produced a tense silence			1
@entity6 stepped in to help find loved ones , setting up a site called @entity21			1
the site allows users to enter the name of a person they 're looking for or update information about someone who was there			1
@entity6 's person finder was invaluable for those trying to find their loved ones in the wake of the @entity11 bombing a few hours after the explosion , the site indicated it was tracking 5,100 records			1
at the race , 51 - year - old @entity38 , of @entity39 , @entity40 , had finished about 15 minutes before the explosions and was about two blocks away when she heard two loud booms			1
she immediately tried to call her parents but could not place the call			1
a friend was able to post on @entity48 that they were ok , but reaching her parents was another worry			1
' i was n't able to call and i felt so bad , ' @entity38 said			2
' when i was finally able to reach them , my mom said she was just absolutely beside herself with fear			2
' on the other side of the continent , in @entity54 , @entity55 was waiting for any word from her brother and sister - in - law			1
@entity61 , 51 , and his wife , dr. @entity62 , 54 , have run several marathons together and always send their sons text messages after crossing the finishing line			2
on monday , those messages did n't arrive and the couple could not be reached via cellphone			1
@entity55 said she went to the marathon 's website and tried to calculate where the couple should be based on their last locations and running speeds			2
she decided they should have already finished the race when the blasts hit			2
' the question is , do you loiter around the finish line ? ' she said			2
' and where was the bomb ? ' finally , about three hours after the blasts , the couple called their sons to tell they were unhurt			2
@entity88 sent his sister a text that said , ' we were about 100 yards from second explosion			0
' as terror and confusion reigned in @entity96 , people turned to social media to reach their friends and family @entity100 , of @entity101 , @entity102 , and her husband were using an app to track their daughter @entity106 's progress along the marathon route			0
they did n't realize anything was wrong until a worried friend texted @entity100 and asked if @entity106 was ok			0
the app indicated that @entity106 was still moving , a relief for her parents			1
@entity100 tried in vain to call her daughter for about 30 minutes before @entity106 called her			0
' when i talked to her she was pretty upset , ' @entity100 said			0
@entity117 , a substitute teacher in the @entity119 area , did not know about the explosions until her students went home and she got a chance to look at her phone			0
there were messages from acquaintances asking , ' is your brother ok ? ' she searched the news and it dawned on her why they were asking			0
heavy cell phone use following the bombing made it incredibly difficult to reach people ' i tried to call him immediately , but there was no cell service , ' the @entity138 , @entity137 , woman said			1
' i waited anxiously by the phone			0
i had a hard time holding myself together			0
' five minutes became 10 , then 20 - finally , 45 minutes later she looked down to see a text from her brother , @entity146			1
he had crossed the finish line shortly before the explosion and was 120 yards away when it went off			0
' i was relieved , ' she said			0
' but the whole thing was so heartbreaking			0
' @entity153 , of @entity154 , had n't been able to reach her husband , @entity155 , who was running with his son , brother and other family members			0
but she said he 'd posted on @entity48 that he and the others were ok			0
' that 's all i know about it , ' @entity153 said , adding she 'd been trying to call since she 'd first heard of the explosions			0
' i 'm just waiting - keep trying to call			1
' she declined to talk further so that she could keep her phone line open .			0

cellphone networks were unable to handle the huge demand for service
@entity6 set up a site which allows users to update information on runners and spectators which anyone can *access*
apps which tracked runners ' movements - and showed if they were still moving - also brought relief to loved ones
