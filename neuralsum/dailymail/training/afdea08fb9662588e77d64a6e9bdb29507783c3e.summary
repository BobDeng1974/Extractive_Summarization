by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 15:34 est , 12 february 2014 @entity3 : 13:48 est , 13 february 2014 @entity4 was the butt of jokes at @entity7 in the late 1990s as her father battled impeachment and fended off the national scandal of his affair with @entity13 intern @entity12			1
and first lady @entity14 kept careful track of her experiences in the @entity13 , especially during her ill - fated 1994 ' @entity18 ' effort to nationalize the health care industry , confiding in long - time friend @entity20 that she might one day need her notes for ' revenge			1
' the new revelations come from a previously unknown archive of @entity26 's papers , willed to the university after the political science professor passed away in 2000			1
the @entity29 first unearthed the treasure trove , setting off a mad scramble of journalists eager to scrape up the bombshell collection 's remains			0
scroll down to read the documents political science professor @entity20 ( r ) kept meticulous notes of her conversations with @entity14 photos like this 1992 post-victory snapshot made the rounds on tv at the height of the @entity44 impeachment , drawing jeers from @entity7 classmates of the then much older @entity48 ( @entity47 ) @entity14 ( c ) , kept notes about friends and foes during her 1994 attempt to reform the @entity1 health care system , saying she would need them someday for ' revenge ' @entity14 told @entity26 that although her daughter @entity48 was a solid student at @entity7 , her classmates mocked her whenever they saw family photos of the @entity59			1
' 2 or 3 hissed ; [ it ] just killed her , ' @entity26 wrote in an excerpt found by @entity62			0
but she added that @entity14 ultimately did ‘ give @entity63 [ @entity44 ] credit for being aware of pain and anguish he ’s caused [ @entity48 ]			1
' @entity68 spotted a reference to a question @entity14 asked @entity26 about ' how best to preserve her general memories of the administration and of health care in particular			0
' on june 20 , 1994 , @entity26 's diary mentions that she asked @entity44 why she would need notes about the episode			2
' revenge , ' @entity44 replied			0
she also predicted she would need recollections of her staff 's insights for a future book project , according to @entity26 's diary on that same day , ' just to get it down while still fresh , so when everyone else is writing their books , she will have materials – dates , meetings , events , to write hers , and for at least that story to be told			2
' other woman : @entity12 , the @entity13 intern whose presidential affair launched the @entity44 impeachment , testified in the @entity98 investigation where the president later lied under oath @entity48 ( r ) had to put up with @entity7 classmates ' jokes about her father 's dalliance with @entity12 , and with headlines like one the @entity106 ran in 1996 but @entity26 wrote the following january that @entity14 decided not to keep any records of personal or ' intimate thoughts and conversations , ' for fear of ' subpoenas ' in years to come			1
@entity26 first befriended @entity44 , who later introduced her to his then - girlfriend @entity14			2
her archived papers include a love letter to an unnamed woman , written by @entity44			2
it 's unclear why she had the letter , raising the possibility of a romantic relationship between the two			0
the @entity29 noted that the intimate letter came with an attached photo of @entity63 playing the saxophone , telling his lover that ' i thought you might get a kick out of this – i was once even younger			2
' @entity26 was eight years older than the future president , who is one year older than his wife @entity14			1
@entity63 's reference to his ' even younger ' self suggests that the letter was written to an older woman			0
water under the bridge : as @entity14 ran for president in 2008 , @entity48 and @entity63 were by her side and all seemed forgotten fourteen years after the @entity139 broke the news of the @entity12 scandal and shamed the @entity1 newsweekly that sought to cover it up , the @entity59 were all smiles at @entity48 's 2010 wedding to millionaire banker @entity146 , the son of a liberal former @entity148 congresswoman the @entity26 archive caught political fire on sunday for @entity14 's reference to @entity12 as ' a narcissistic looney - tune			1
' also drawing focus were the conclusions of a secret poll conducted by pollsters @entity155 and @entity157 in 1992 that painted @entity14 in a horible political light			0
' while voters genuinely admire @entity14 ’s intelligence and tenacity , they are uncomfortable with these traits in a woman , ' the public opinion gurus determined			0
' what voters find slick in @entity44 , they find ruthless in @entity14			0

revelations come from the archives of @entity20 , a @entity175 political science professor who knew the @entity59 for decades
@entity14 , she wrote , thought she would need to remember who helped and who hurt her during her ill - fated march toward nationalized ' @entity18 '
@entity44 's affair with intern @entity12 and his *ensuing* impeachment battle caused daughter @entity48 no end of *embarrassment*
@entity7 classmates would jeer whenever family *portraits* were shown on tv , @entity14 recalled , and it ' just killed her '
a love letter in @entity26 's files from a young and *passionate* @entity63 may indicate a romance between the two , since the much younger future president jokingly refers to himself as having once been ' even younger '
