it is one of the most spectacular @entity2 , with a wingspan of more than 1.5 metres			0
so when this magnificent osprey swooped down to poach a trout from a loch near @entity8 in the @entity9 , the outcome was perhaps predictable			1
but that did n’t stop one plucky duck from playing the role of gamekeeper			0
catch : the osprey swoops for the trout in the @entity9 loch - drawing the attention of a mallard attack : the osprey attempts to take flight with the trout between its claws - and with the mallard in hot pursuit as the raptor clasped the fish between its iron - like talons , the outraged mallard – a featherweight by comparison , with a mere 80cm wingspan – launched a full - frontal attack			1
spreading its wings , it churned the water into a frenzy , quacking loudly in anger			0
had the osprey , also known as a sea hawk , not been so determined , it may well have scored a duck			0
but in the end , the mallard ’s valiant efforts were in vain and the osprey made away with its tasty catch			2
