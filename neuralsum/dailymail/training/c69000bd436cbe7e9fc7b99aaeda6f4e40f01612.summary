but @entity13 stunt cyclist @entity12 dreamt up the skilfull display in a giant play room himself for a @entity17 sponsored video released yesterday			0
the 27 - year - old daredevil 's latest clip begins with a younger version of the biker playing in his room in a remote cottage on the isle of @entity25 - where @entity12 himself was brought up			1

the former bike mechanic jumps over and somersaults off a series of oversized props made to look like toy building blocks , @entity45 cubes and even flipping over the top of a @entity17 @entity3 racing car			0
