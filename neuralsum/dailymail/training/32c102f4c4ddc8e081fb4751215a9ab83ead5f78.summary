by @entity0 potholes are the bug bane of every driver , but it seems that they 're not a modern affliction			0
archaeologists have discovered that as far back as the @entity8 , drivers were forced to deal with faulty and uneven road surfaces			1
wheel ruts found in a newly excavated road surface in @entity12 are thought to be similar to those at @entity14 , and were caused by carts being driven over them			1
a roman road discovered on an archaeological dig has repairs to the road surface , proving pot holes are nothing new			1
small pieces of clay and rocks ( pictured ) were found that had been laid after the original rocks had been placed , suggesting the @entity8 attempted to fill these ruts and make the road smoother @entity28 and rocks found in these ruts , that appear to have been laid after the original rocks had been placed , suggest the @entity8 attempted to fill them to make the road smoother			1
archaeologist @entity33 , the @entity34 for the @entity35 said : ‘ the road must have been extensively used , it ’s intriguing to think what the horse - drawn carts may have been carrying and who was driving them			2
' this is a fantastic opportunity to see a snapshot of life 2,000 years ago			0
’ the excavation at @entity47 began following the discovery of a complex series of archaeological features thought to be part of the largest @entity54 - @entity53 settlement in @entity12 outside of @entity55			1
in @entity57 , people travelled on land on horseback , in carts pulled by oxen , or walking on roads they created , known as viae			2
floor mosaics of the frigidarium of the @entity65 in @entity66 show a typical @entity57 cart being pulled by horses ( pictured ) during @entity57 , people travelled on land on horseback , in carts pulled by oxen , or walking on roads they created , known as viae			0
before the @entity8 arrived , the region had no proper roads and while the majority they built were straight and designed to be the shortest route possible , roads were known to zigzag to make going uphill easier			1
straight roads also saved construction time and material costs			0
when they built a road across boggy ground , for example , roman engineers placed sticks and sheepskins as foundations , to stop the road sinking			0
the @entity8 then built their roads on foundations of clay , chalk and gravel , with larger , flat stones on top			1
the road sloped from the middle to ditches either side , to help water drain off the surface			2
the laws of the @entity103 legislation written in approximately 450 bc - specified a road should be 8 ft ( 2.45 m ) wide when straight , and 16 ft ( 4.90 m ) where curved			0
the tables added @entity8 should give wayfarers the right to pass over private land where the road is in disrepair			1
the @entity8 therefore aimed to make roads that did n’t need constant repair , but the evidence found in @entity47 suggests their techniques were n't foolproof			1

the excavation site is at @entity47 in @entity12 ( marked )			2
university of @entity55 archaeologist , dr @entity174 said : ' we are beginning to demonstrate the importance of this site in the @entity57 period when the road going through the settlement connected @entity47 with the @entity57 world ' roman law and tradition forbid the use of vehicles in urban areas , except in certain cases			0
@entity55 archaeologist , dr @entity174 added : ’ this season ’s excavations are proving to be a real success			0
‘ we are beginning to demonstrate the importance of this site in the @entity57 period when the road going through the settlement connected @entity47 with the @entity57 world and brought here not only coins , but also pottery and personal goods used in everyday life			0
’ the dig is funded by the @entity55 , @entity35 , @entity203 and @entity204			0
@entity205 : the @entity206 of the @entity8 model ( pictured ) is based on a simplified version of the network of cities , roads , rivers and sea lanes that framed movement across the @entity8			2
it broadly reflects conditions around 200 ce , it also covers a sites and roads created in late antiquity			0

wheel ruts were found during excavation of a road surface in @entity12
they are thought to have been caused by carts driven over the surface
small pieces of clay and rocks were found among the larger , flat rocks
this suggests they were laid after the original rocks had been placed
*experts* believe they are signs of repairs made by the @entity8 to fill the gaps and make the road smoother
