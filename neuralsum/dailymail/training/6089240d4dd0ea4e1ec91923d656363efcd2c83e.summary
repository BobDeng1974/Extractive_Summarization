by @entity0 published : 19:50 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 06:32 est , 29 november 2013 working couple : deputy prime minister @entity2 and wife @entity3 who have three sons parental leave rules are to be torn up to smash the ‘ old - fashioned assumption ’ that women rather than men should stay at home to look after young children			1
deputy prime minister @entity2 will today unveil plans to allow new mothers and fathers to share leave – meaning men will be able to take almost a year off work			1
mr @entity2 , who took an extended period of paternity leave when his first son was born , said the current system , which means a father can only take a fortnight off after the birth of a child , was ‘ edwardian ’			1
his wife @entity3 returned to work first , but admitted she relied on an army of helpers ‘ making my life possible ’			1
the proposals have been the subject of a fierce @entity33 argument and have split the business community			0
the @entity35 condemned them as a ‘ nightmare for small businesses ’ but the @entity39 said it was pleased the @entity40 had listened to concerns about the system			1
mr @entity2 ’s plans will anger some conservatives , who argue firms can not be expected to cope with more rights for employees as the economy comes out of recession			0
from april 2015 , parents will be able to share 52 weeks of leave			1
new mothers will have to use the first two weeks , deemed important for recovery and bonding with their baby			2
but they will be able to transfer the rest of the time off to their partner – meaning he can tell his employer he wants as many as 50 weeks off			1
alternatively , parents could each take 25 weeks concurrently – or opt for one to take a period of time off and then the other			2
but @entity63 have insisted that businesses have the right to make parents take leave in a continuous stretch if they deem coming and going over the year is too disruptive			1
the proposals have been the subject of a fierce @entity33 argument and have split the business community the right to shared leave will only apply to couples who both work			1
the first 39 weeks of shared leave will be paid at the statutory minimum , with the last 13 weeks unpaid			2
fathers will be guaranteed the right to return to the same job after up to 26 weeks off , but could be offered a different , equivalent post if they are away for longer			0
an employee will be required to give their employer eight weeks ’ notice of their intention to take leave			2
there will be a cap on requesting separate blocks of time off – at three per employee			0
ministers say the measures will offer flexibility to modern families where women are as likely as men to be the main breadwinner			0
mr @entity2 argued that the new system will drive a ‘ real cultural shift ’ , reducing the impact of pregnancy on women ’s careers and helping working fathers play a greater role in childcare			0
when his eldest son @entity109 , 11 , was born in 2002 , the @entity108 leader took an extended period of paternity leave so wife @entity3 could return to work first			0
he took two weeks ’ paternity leave after the birth of son @entity114 , in 2009 and also when @entity115 , eight , was born			2
but his wife has previously revealed that she has an army of helpers to enable the family to juggle work and childcare			0
mrs @entity122 said she was able to rely on ‘ a lot of shadows behind me making my life possible ’ , including a nanny ‘ who is almost like my aunt and gives me orders ’			0
the deputy prime minister said : ‘ women deserve the right to pursue their goals and not feel they have to choose between having a successful career or having a baby			1
' they should be supported by their employers , rather than being made to feel less employable or under pressure to take unchallenging jobs			0
’ he added : ‘ we need to challenge the old - fashioned assumption that women will always be the parent that stays at home – many fathers want that option too			0
’ mr @entity2 condemned existing ‘ outdated @entity154 parental leave laws ’ , adding that ‘ the whole economy is suffering because we ’re not giving women more opportunities to combine family and work ’			1
@entity155 , of the @entity35 , said the proposals heaped ‘ yet more burdens on struggling employers at a time when government should be freeing them to create jobs and wealth ’			1
‘ the proposed system is considerably more complex and unwieldy … and employers will , once again , have to absorb the cost of adapting and implementing this new system , ’ he added			0
the @entity168 ’s @entity167 warned that unless leave is backed up with better pay ‘ couples simply wo n’t be able to afford to take it ’			2
