by @entity0 fisherman @entity1 cuts the engine of his sailing boat on a gently swelling sea beyond @entity5 , so all we can hear is the sound of the waves			1
‘ listen ! ’ he whispers			2
‘ hear that gurgling sound ? that ’s the boat singing to us			1
’ and so it seems			2
there is no lullaby as gentle as the quiet lapping of water against the sides of a small boat			1
@entity1 , 75 , runs up the main sail			1
the breeze tugs at it			2
it bellies out and we ’re off , gliding on a current of air			2
seadog : fisherman @entity1 has become the go - to man for @entity28 film scouts hoping to give authenticity to nautical scenes by including sea - faring men he reels in his fishing lines			1
all along them , like jewels on a necklace , hang a shoal of mackerel , silver and iridescent green			2
below in the cabin , @entity1 ’s mate @entity40 , 63 , brews coffee			1
we warm our hands on mugs of it			2
above us , in a cold , bright sky , an early winter sun shines			2
‘ @entity49 , ’ declares @entity1			1
and that ’s just how it seems			2
@entity1 fell in love with the sea 65 years ago ; now it runs in his blood , a briny tide			1
and if you were to ask anyone , the world over , to describe an old sea dog , they ’d paint a verbal picture of him : a face craggy and weathered by salt and sea air ; snowy hair and a white beard ; twinkling eyes as blue as a summer tide			2
which is why , when @entity28 film scouts are looking for sea - faring men — sailors , fishermen , sea captains , pirates — to give authenticity to nautical scenes , @entity1 is their go - to man			1
and why , late in life , he has a burgeoning career as an extra in big - screen movies			2
@entity28 calls : @entity1 spruced up as the captain of the @entity84 for a tv documentary during his burgeoning career as an extra in big - screen movies and tv programmes @entity1 has worked alongside a veritable galaxy of a-list stars			1
his credits include @entity92 , @entity94 ’s 2012 gothic comedy starring @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 , who plays a 200 - year - old vampire			1
@entity99 portrayed a fisherman in the film as he also did in @entity102 , a 2012 fantasy based on the @entity105 ’s fairy tale and starring @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			2
spruce and neatly barbered , he was elevated to @entity111 of the @entity84 in a 2012 @entity113 documentary film @entity84 : case closed			0
he even had a line ( ‘ carry on , @entity116 ’ ) to deliver to the doomed ship ’s first officer			0
he appears , too , in @entity119 , a @entity122 / @entity121 collaboration for @entity123 in which he brings realism to a dockside scene as a beggar			0
and his most recent call was to @entity129 , where he will play a fisherman in @entity132 ’s remake of @entity133 , directed by @entity134 , with @entity135 as the fairy godmother and @entity137 , of @entity138 , as @entity139			2
but how it all came to be is a story in itself			0
for decades , @entity99 — long - since divorced with three daughters and 11 grandchildren — has garnered a reputation as a local celebrity on the picturesque quayside of @entity5 , @entity147			1
you ’ll find him there most days on his boat , @entity152			2
worked alongside celebs : @entity99 portrayed a fisherman in film @entity102 , a 2012 fantasy starring @entity107 , @entity106 and @entity108 ( left to right ) a-listers : @entity1 has worked alongside a veritable galaxy of a-list stars including @entity96 ( left ) and @entity97 ( right ) in @entity94 's 2012 gothic comedy @entity92 a lithe man , upright as a ship ’s mast , in navy blue @entity162 and reefer jacket , he sits among barnacled lobster pots , smoking a roll - up			1
sightseers are drawn to him			0
many ask to photograph him and he is always happy to say ‘ yes ’ as long as they donate £ 1 to the @entity169			0
indeed , one recent summer ’s day , he reckons he raised about £ 85 for the lifeboats			0
but he made the leap into films by accident , when five years ago production workers on @entity177 ’s film @entity178 — set in 1966 , it features a fictitious pirate radio station — arrived in @entity5 to recruit extras for a sea rescue scene			1
@entity1 was walking along the seafront to his boat when he saw the queue of hopefuls waiting to audition outside a hotel			1
he bumped into a friend who told him the extras were wanted for background shots and needed to ‘ blend in ’			2
‘ i told him : “ i ’d be no good for that			0
i stick out like a sore thumb			0
” ’ but as he stood having a smoke and chatting , he was approached by a man with a clipboard who encouraged him to apply			0
‘ so i thought : “ why not ? ” and that ’s how i got the job			0
’ he beams a toothless smile			0
there are only two teeth in @entity1 ’s head			1
‘ i did have three , but i pulled one out with a pair of long - nosed pliers only last week			0
it was giving me gyp			0
’ @entity1 took to filming like a boat to water : he featured in the @entity177 film as one of the crew of a fishing boat that goes to the rescue of the pirate radio djs in a storm			1
‘ one of my grandsons told me : “ @entity220 , i saw you in the film — for all of five seconds ! ” ’ he chuckles			0
extras career : mr @entity1 with fellow fisherman @entity40 stand beside their boat in @entity5 , @entity147 it might have ended there , were it not for @entity1 ’s friend @entity229 , a keen amateur photographer , who persuaded him to enrol with @entity230 , an agency specialising in extras with character			1
thereafter , the work rolled in			2
‘ i never need make - up , ’ says @entity1 , proudly			1
indeed , his sea - blown characteristics are so perfect , one make - up lady refused to trim his beard after he asked her to			0
she told him : ‘ my notes say : “ do n’t touch his beard			0
do n’t touch his hair			0
do n’t touch a thing			0
” ’ @entity1 ’s interpretation is : ‘ they ’re too polite to say it , but i ’m scruffy and that ’s exactly the look they want			1
but i ’ve lived with this face for 75 years			0
i would n’t change it now			0
’ indeed , the casting agents were so impressed with @entity1 that they asked @entity251 if she knew any more @entity5 fishermen who might also want to become film extras			1
after placing an advert in the bistro where they go for breakfast , lots of men came forward			0
the agency recruited 12 — @entity1 ’s friend @entity261 among them — and they were asked to grow @entity99 - style beards			1
‘ so any fisherman you see hereabouts with a beard has most likely been in a film , ’ says @entity1			1
beginning of his movie career : @entity1 got his first extras job working on @entity177 's film the boat that rocked after the film crew arrived in @entity5 to recruit extras for a sea rescue scene they hired a minibus to go to @entity129 to film @entity92 and later , @entity102			1
@entity1 ’s friend @entity278 , 60 , who appeared in both films , remembers the fanfare when they turned up on the set , a replica of a harbour town in @entity285			1
he says : ‘ someone shouted : “ everyone stop ! the @entity288 have arrived ! they ’ll show you exactly what happens on a boat ! ” ‘ they ’d even imported @entity121 seagulls which had to be looked after by a specially employed seagull wrangler			2
’ the high - point for @entity278 was sitting during a pub scene next to veteran actor @entity296			0
‘ @entity97 was there , too , filming until 2am			1
he chatted with us and was lovely to everyone , ’ says @entity278			0
they even shared a pint with film producer @entity302 who was responsible for such hits as @entity304 and @entity305 ( @entity92 was his penultimate film before his death last year )			0
a photo of them all is displayed in @entity99 ’s local , @entity310 , on the harbourside			2
‘ see that knife stuck in the table ? ’ @entity1 says , pointing to a lethal looking blade in the photo			1
‘ that ’s my best filleting knife			0
’ memorable moment : a high point in @entity1 's career was sitting next to @entity296 in a pub scene out on the sea , sailing past oil tankers , fishing boats and the condor cross-channel ferry , @entity1 is most at home			1
he and @entity40 , friends for almost 50 years , share reminiscences about their filming exploits			0
@entity40 remembers : ‘ during filming of @entity102 , the producer told @entity1 to say to me “ that ’s the huntsman ” every time one actor rode by			1
the third time he said it , i said : “ @entity99			0
you ’ve already told me twice			0
i know it ’s the blooming huntsman ! ” @entity1 said : “ you silly b * * * * r , i ’ve been told to say that ! ” ’ then there was the occasion their friend , fisherman @entity341 , newly recovering from a cataract op , was called on to man a fish stall on the set of @entity346			1
‘ and he was blinking and grimacing because of the eye op , ’ says @entity1 , ‘ and they says to him : “ yes , that ’s brilliant			1
@entity351 at the lady customers just like that ! ” ’ the little boat is rocking with their laughter			2
@entity1 and @entity40 are a double act , united by their love of the sea			1
every weekend , @entity40 deserts his wife @entity361 to go sea fishing with his friend			0
‘ my wife spends a lot more on her pleasures than i do , but i enjoy myself more , ’ he says			0
‘ come friday , i ’m still smiling from the weekend before			0
’ @entity1 concurs : ‘ i ’m never happier than when i ’m out on the water			1
and filming ’s a good life , too			0
we just mess around with nets and fish like we would do anyway			0
’ i wonder what characters @entity1 would like to play next			1
‘ i could be the new captain @entity374 , ’ he says , ‘ only a slimmer , trimmer version			0
and if @entity97 makes another @entity377 , i ’d love to be in that			1
‘ in fact , ’ he smiles , ‘ they need look no further than @entity5 for the whole cast			1
the @entity381 could supply a complete crew			0

he first started extras work on the boat that rocked
