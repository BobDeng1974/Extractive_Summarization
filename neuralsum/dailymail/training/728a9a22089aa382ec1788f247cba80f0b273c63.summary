a couple who sent a barrage of emails and letters to their children ’s school have been strongly criticised by a high court judge			1
the unnamed @entity8 couple were described as ‘ foolish , overbearing and demanding ’ after swamping independent @entity9 , @entity10 , south west @entity11 , with complaints that verged on the ridiculous			1
in one complaint the mother – who sent most of the communication – said she was unhappy that their six - year - old daughter had been scored an a and not an @entity19 in a spelling test			1
claim : a judge at the @entity22 in @entity11 , pictured , has rejected a damages claim brought by an ' overbearing ' couple against a school , after it asked their children to be taken out in another , she wrote about her concerns over the ' unhygienic ' position of her son ’s water bottle in the classroom			1
the school was left no choice but to ask the parents to take the children out of the school , sparking the legal battle in which the parents claimed a breach of contract			1
however , taking the side of the school , judge @entity41 said their behaviour ‘ went well beyond the realms of even the most zealous , some might say pushy , parents ’			1
describing the ‘ enduring nightmare ’ that the school suffered at their hands , judge @entity41 said : ' the focus of any school should be on the education and welfare of the children who attend it			1
of course , parents need to play a full role and take a keen interest in their children			2
that is right and proper			0
' but equally , parents must - and most do - appreciate that school is a community which needs to be permitted to get on with its principal task of educating children collectively			1
no school should be bombarded with unwarrantable demands by parents			2
' @entity67 and other staff bear a high responsibility in what they do			0
looking over their shoulders for fear of litigious parents is one aspect of their professional lives they could well do without			0
judge @entity41 said their behaviour ¿ went well beyond the realms of even the most zealous , some might say pushy , parents ' it is also of critical importance that teachers and others of whatever rank feel able to express their views with candour			0
' the couple were seeking £ 50,000 in damages from the school , claiming teachers backtracked on a deal to give their children good references after they were withdrawn from the institution			1
but the businessman and his wife , who can not be identified to protect their two sons and daughter whom the judge described as ' delightful ' , were the ' authors of their own misfortune ' , the judge said			0
he said the meddling parents ' case was unseemly and without one shred of believable evidence to support it			0
tensions between the parents and staff worsened when headteacher @entity115 insisted on being present during meetings between them and teachers			2
but it was at a subsequent parents ' evening last summer when the couples ' behaviour left staff ' visibly shaken '			1
the couple confronted teachers , kept one member of staff in discussion for 45 minutes and left two senior members of staff extremely upset			1
the judge brushed aside the father ’s insistence that the meeting had been simply ' lively ' , and described both the mother and father 's conduct as ' appalling '			2
headteacher @entity115 had then asked for the children to be withdrawn - or they would be expelled - as the relationship between the family and the school had broken down			1
he said the children must leave through no fault of their own , with the next term ’s fees waived and deposits returned , due to the irretrievable breakdown in trust			0
mr @entity115 agreed to write supportive references for the boys to the head of nearby @entity152 , @entity153 , but did not , as was claimed , say he would not disclose information about the parents if asked , as it would have been professionally negligent to have done so			1
the judge rejected the couple ’s allegation that mr @entity115 had conspired with mr @entity153 , resulting in the boys being refused a place			2
the school , not pictured , was accused of back - tracking on a deal it made when three children were withdrawn ( file photo ) , but this was rejected by the @entity22 ' there was no cover - up nor conspiracy nor anything else untoward			1
to suggest mr @entity115 and mr @entity153 were bare - faced liars was frankly outrageous			0
they leave this court as honest and honourable men , as they arrived			0
' the judge said that most parents would have been ' absolutely delighted ' with the school ’s observation that the couple ’s children were a ' credit to you both ' and there were no concerns for their future development either academically or socially			1
instead , the parents ' viewed everything in a self - centred self - contained artifice as though no - one else but them and their children mattered '			2
' they interfered and meddled with the school and made unwarranted demands			0
of course , all parents want the best for their children			2
parents at fee - paying schools rightly demand the best but the school must be allowed to be a school			2
' the conduct of the parents far exceeded the worst excesses of normal concerned parents by a considerable margin			0
i can well believe their domineering and demanding conduct became an enduring nightmare for the school			1
' this parental misconduct - and it was misconduct - was such a shame as , whatever their failings , their children are a delight and were much liked by the staff at the school			1
' if only the parents had been sensible , restrained and interested in their children ’s progress , and there was progress , instead of being foolish , overbearing and demanding , events would have been , i am sure , to the advantage of all their children			0
' he added : ' whichever way one looks at this case from a legal viewpoint , there is simply not a viable case against the defendant			0
there was no breach of contract whatever			0
there was a variation of an extant contract to bring it to an end			0
' after the ruling in @entity11 , mr @entity115 said : ' we are very glad at the outcome			0
we do n’t think it should ever have come to this stage and we are very glad that the children are settled in another school and are doing well			0
' the parents declined to comment			0
