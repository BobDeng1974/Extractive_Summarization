archaeologists have unearthed hundreds of @entity2 graves in southwest @entity3 , some of which contain skeletons still bound by shackles on their necks and ankles			1
the incredible excavation is located at a building site about 250m west of the @entity13 amphitheatre once used for battles between gladiators and wild animals			0
among the hundreds of graves found , five skeletons - four adults and one child - were found shackled or chained			2
a skeleton uncovered at the @entity2 burial site pictured exactly as the individual was buried - with an iron shackle attached to his neck a wider photo shows the same skeleton - thought to be a man - with a shackle on his ankle as well as his neck this group of four people were buried head - to - toe in a small , trench - style grave dating back to the first and second centuries @entity34 , the grave site is thought to have been an important necropolis used for those massacred at the nearby stadium			1
three skeletons were found with iron chains attached to their legs , another was buried in a crude shackle around his neck and a child was found with a device on its wrist			2
several of the graves were found to be mass burials - pictures show individuals buried side - by - side , head to toe in trench - style graves			1
the site was first identified as a possible necropolis last year and scientists are now hoping they can establish the individuals ' cause of death			1
roman necropoleis were usually constructed in the country as a site for burials and cremations to take place away from tombs built within a city			0
in this photo , another skeleton can be seen buried with a shackle still attached to its ankle unfortunately , the graves at @entity13 have yielded almost no artefacts or possessions			2
only a few vases were found with the remains of one man , and a child was found with coins resting on his eyes			0
roman custom was to place coins on the eyes of the deceased so the person 's spirit could pay the ferryman to take them across the river @entity2 believed divided the world of the living and that of the dead			1
the period of @entity2 rule across what is now @entity3 is commonly referred to as @entity97 , and the graves discovered in @entity13 this week fall within this category			1
