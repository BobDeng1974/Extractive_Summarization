' i think the @entity40 people are with me			2
young people who use computers are with me			0
' on the news program @entity1 unveiled his plan to urge all @entity32 and phone providers to ask their customers to join in in a class - action lawsuit			1
' if we get 10 million @entity40 saying we do n’t want our phone records looked at , then maybe someone will wake up and something will change in @entity56 , ' he said			2
the information surveillance program was exposed last week by @entity58 , who released details of the top secret court order issued to @entity62 in april , requiring that the company turn over phone records to the government on an ' ongoing daily basis			1
' @entity1 announced on @entity42 that he would like to bring a @entity4 challenge against the government 's phone and internet surveillance program of its private citizens the court order mandated that the company give the numbers of both parties on the call , their locations , call duration , and the time the calls were placed , though the call 's contents were not revealed or recorded			1
the telephone company was told to record their subscribers information whether they were suspected of a crime or not , resulting in roughly three billion phone records being turned over a day			0
' that does n’t look like a modest invasion of privacy , ' @entity1 told @entity42			2
' i have no problem if you have probable cause … but we ’re talking about trolling through a billion phone records a day			0
' one of @entity1 's biggest objections to the program is that the government is using a general warrant to obtain the data , as opposed to a specific warrant targeting specific suspects			1
@entity1 argued that this violates the @entity104 with prevents unreasonable search and seizure of citizens			2
he also alleged on the program that the massive amount of data gathering is actually hindering the government 's targeting of terrorists , as they are overwhelmed by the volume of audio conversations and can not pinpoint specific criminal correspondence			1

he condemned the @entity117 administration , calling his government ' authoritarianism , ' and criticizing the new surveillance tactics as being harsher than anything president @entity133 used during his time in office ' the irony is that people voted for president @entity117 hoping for something different , ' he said			0
' that 's why a lot of people i think are disappointed in the president			0
' meanwhile , the president and several senators have come out in defense of the information monitoring			2
' you ca n't have 100 per cent security and also then have 100 per cent privacy and zero inconvenience , ' @entity42 quoted president @entity117 as saying			0
' we 're going to have to make some choices as a society			0
' senator @entity155 , chair of the @entity156 , spoke in favor of the information monitoring programming claiming that it helped to keep @entity40 safe against further terrorist attacks ' terrorists will come after us if they can and the only thing that we have to deter this is good intelligence , senator @entity155 , chair of the @entity156 said in a press conference			1
' it 's to ferret this out before this happens			0
it 's called protecting @entity40			2
i think people want the homeland kept safe			0
' @entity56 officials have acknowledged that all branches of the federal government were aware of the @entity12 act being carried out over the past few months under the @entity179 , the @entity123 reported			1
however @entity1 still has strong objections to the way in which the government has been gathering its data against terrorists			2
' i 've been saying for a long time that we ought to obey the @entity127 and the @entity188 , ' the @entity123 reported that @entity1 said in a statement			0
' i 'm all for going after terrorists , i 'm all for going after criminals , but i think you go to a judge and you ask for a warrant specified to a person			0
you should n't look at millions and millions			0
