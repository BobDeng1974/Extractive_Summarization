these images look like incredible paintings - but in fact they are close - ups of water from a mountain stream which runs over the earth 's minerals			1

the close - ups of water from a @entity21 stream which runs over the earth â€™s minerals show an incredible array of colors the thin layer of film full of minerals sits on top of the slow moving stream as the water mixes with deposits from the ground the colorful water , which emerges from mountain springs , is created by a natural process and occurs in areas of abundant minerals photographer @entity33 , 66 , spotted the water in the @entity35 near @entity36 - just 50 miles south west of the state capital @entity38			1
the former construction project manager was out shooting waterfalls , cascades and streams when he spotted one had an unusual colour			0
he said : ' @entity45 is known for its mining of minerals , particularly gold and silver			0
' the minerals lay dormant until the spring run - off and the water fills the ground like a sponge			2
' once filled , the ground water then oozes out of the dirt banks and picks up minerals from the dirt			2
photographer @entity33 , 66 , spotted the water in the @entity35 near @entity36 - just 50 miles south west of the state capital @entity38 @entity33 explained that the state of @entity45 is known for its mining of minerals , particularly gold and silver the minerals that create the incredible colors lay dormant in the earth until the spring run - off and the water fills the ground like a sponge ' there are hundreds of these minerals in the mountains - in addition to silver and gold there is uranium , radon , radium , sulphates , lead , copper and molybdenum			1
' the contaminated water , which emerges from mountain springs , is a natural process in areas of abundant minerals			1
however , the incredible colors can take weeks to form as rain water can wash it all away in seconds			0
once the ground is saturated , the ground water then oozes out of the dirt banks and picks up minerals from the dirt @entity33 , a former construction project manager , was out shooting waterfalls , cascades and streams when he spotted one had an unusual colour @entity33 explained that there are hundreds of these minerals in the mountains - in addition to silver and gold there is uranium , radon , radium , sulphates , lead , copper and molybdenum the incredible colors in the streams can take weeks to form as rain water can wash it all away in a matter of seconds @entity33 , from @entity119 , @entity45 , added : ' photographers like to shoot unusual , beautiful , breathtaking scenes			1
' when i discovered the minerals , my friend and i immediately stopped and focused on the minerals			0
' they are difficult to shoot as so many variables come into play and some of the colors come from reflected light			0
thunderstorms , rain showers and hailstorms can destroy the minerals and it may take several dry days for the minerals to reform @entity33 , from @entity119 , @entity45 , said that photographers like to shoot unusual , breathtaking scenes - and these streams are a perfect example @entity33 said that when he discovered the minerals , he and his friends immediately stopped what they were doing and focused on them ' thunderstorms , rain showers and hailstorms destroy the minerals and it could take several dry days for the minerals to reform			2
' the minerals are a really a fragile layer of film merging with slow moving water			0
' but pure and simple they took my breath away as the colors and designs were unlike anything i had seen before			0
' the minerals that create the breathtaking colors are a really a fragile layer of film merging with slow moving water , @entity33 explained the @entity35 in @entity45 contain a rich array of minerals within its wilderness of mountains , lakes and valleys @entity33 said that ' pure and simple they took my breath away as the colors and designs were unlike anything i had seen before ' the minerals on the water ' are difficult to shoot as so many variables come into play and some of the colors come from reflected light '			1

photographer @entity33 , 66 , spotted the water in the @entity35 near @entity36 , just 50 miles from @entity38
the contaminated water in the mountain springs is created through a natural process in areas of abundant minerals
colors are created by layer of minerals sitting on top of the stream as the water mixes with deposits from the ground
