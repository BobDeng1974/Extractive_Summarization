after failing to win a match during the disastrous 2010 @entity5 campaign in @entity17 and struggling during qualification for @entity4 , the free - scoring @entity19 finally believe they have their confidence back			2

' if we do not do it then it would be a failure			0

' @entity1 found goals easy to come by in their first two @entity53 matches , beating @entity54 3 - 0 and @entity55 5 - 2 , before confirming their place as groupwinners after a 0 - 0 draw with @entity60			0
and @entity61 midfielder @entity8 believes they need to keep playing in the same way to progress			1
he said : ' for us , the goal is to win the @entity5 otherwise it is useless to participate - but without putting unnecessary pressure on ourselves			2
@entity68 : @entity7 ( left ) says the campaign will have been ' a failure ' if they do not lift the trophy attack : @entity8 ( right ) says the squad must ' build on the exciting game ' they used during the group ' we will see upcoming deadlines , but the the players and staff , we say that there is something beautiful to do			1

' you can not play twenty - three players			0
' relaxed : @entity96 ( left ) and @entity7 ( right ) enjoy a joke ahead of @entity1 's clash with @entity34 on monday goals : @entity100 ( centre ) could be key if @entity1 are to win the @entity5 in @entity4			1
