there is a convincing argument to suggest that @entity2 is n’t good enough to a @entity4 goalkeeper			1
if that is the case then logic tells us his understudy @entity8 is n’t either			1
@entity8 had n’t played a @entity11 game for more than 18 months prior to sunday ’s game at @entity13			1
such are @entity4 ’s problems at the moment , though , that the @entity16 was handed perhaps the biggest challenge of his rather modest career			2
when @entity4 reflect on what went wrong , they will perhaps not focus too much on their stand - in goalkeeper			1
he is not the reason they lost			0
manager @entity25 will focus on chances missed by @entity27 and @entity28 and ask why defenders @entity29 and @entity31 made basic errors			1
@entity33 denies @entity28 in the second half in what was an impressive display from @entity37 1 @entity38 celebrates as @entity37 go up the other end of the pitch and score as he keeps a clean sheet @entity38 pulled off a number of important saves to deny @entity27 @entity8 had a game to forget as he let in three goals as @entity4 lost at @entity37 nevertheless , while @entity37 goalkeeper @entity33 made three or four crucial saves that helped his own only fleetingly effective team over the line , it is very much the case that @entity8 offered @entity4 very little , or anything , of the same ilk			1
@entity37 ’s player of the season so far – made two good saves – both from @entity27 – and one outstanding one from @entity28			1
undoubtedly , @entity37 would not have won without them			0
the first save stopped his team falling behind and 25 seconds later they were ahead			0
his stop from @entity28 , meanwhile , came at the start of the second half and prevented @entity4 assembling a comeback that was beginning to look likely			2
@entity8 , on the other hand , was largely helpless , if not quite hopeless			2
his very first contribution was to slice a clearance first time up in the air			0
given that distribution has been one of @entity2 ’s recent problems , this did not bode well			0
soon after , he was picking the ball out of his net , having dived the wrong way as @entity76 struck firmly towards goal from the edge of the penalty area			0
@entity8 ( left ) gets his hands to the ball under pressure from @entity37 forward @entity83 @entity8 can only watch on as @entity85 ( left ) scores @entity37 's second at @entity13 @entity85 wheels away to celebrate as the @entity16 remonstrates with the @entity4 defence after that , there was a rash dash from goal at a corner – he got nowhere near the ball – and a routine take from a low @entity76 cross before he could do nothing about @entity85 ’s decisive second goal scored from an offside position just before half - time			1
@entity38 was actually the busier goalkeeper for much of the game and perhaps that did n’t help @entity8			1
goalkeepers – like to outfield players – like to find a rhythm , especially if they have n’t played for a while , and @entity8 was unable to do that here			2
the save he made from a @entity76 shot as @entity37 broke early in the second period was comfortable enough but shortly after @entity38 ’s saved from @entity28 , @entity8 stumbled in trying to adjust to @entity31 ’s error and @entity109 was able to slide the third goal in to an empty net			1
it was n’t a decisive mistake			0
it was n’t even that noticeable at first			0
but it was indicative of @entity4 ’s afternoon			2
but then we knew that			0
about @entity8 and the indeed about the team he represents .			0

@entity29 and @entity31 made basic errors during 3 - 0 loss
