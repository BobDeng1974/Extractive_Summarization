@entity2 manager @entity1 ' attempts to sign @entity3 forward @entity4 have been given the green light by the player 's manager @entity6			1
@entity1 watched the @entity10 club 's second string at the weekend with a view to asking after @entity4 and his team - mate the striker @entity13			2
@entity14 lost again and are now just one place and one point above the drop zone but it seems @entity14 coach @entity6 is still open to the idea of players leaving			1
he said : ' it is a question of talking to all parties			0
i would n't close any doors because it is no good having players here whose heads are elsewhere '			0
@entity3 youngster @entity4 ( left ) has emerged as a target for @entity1 ' @entity2 revolution @entity1 watched @entity14 at the weekend where he also ran the rule over striker @entity13 the comment was understood to refer to speedy winger @entity4 who has already starred and scored for the @entity3 first team in the @entity33 this season			1
he turned 19 on sunday and the club believe he could progress to the first team as early as next season but that does not rule out a loan move now			0
former @entity3 striker @entity40 has rediscovered his scoring touch at the @entity42 @entity1 ( left ) has also brought in @entity44 graduate @entity43 and would like to add more with former @entity3 players @entity40 and @entity43 at the club @entity1 would like to add to his @entity44 contingent and has also looked at @entity13 who has already scored for the first team in the league			1
@entity13 seems less keen to force his way out and is likely to remain in @entity51			0
it is vitally important that @entity3 stay in the second division in @entity51 because of the drop in quality from the second division to the four regional divisions in the third tier			0
with another defeat at the weekend @entity14 continued to plummit and @entity6 's job is on the line but that does not appeared to have ended @entity2 's chances of landing @entity4 .			2

@entity1 is *interested* in @entity14 players @entity4 and @entity13
coach @entity6 has *hinted* that @entity4 will be *allowed* to leave
@entity2 already have former @entity44 stars @entity40 and @entity43
