a year - long experiment examining the sales of @entity9 on @entity10 in the @entity11 revealed racial bias as black sellers did worse than their white counterparts the research showed that black sellers got fewer responses and lower offers for their ipods , while shoppers were also less attracted to white sellers with tattoos on their wrists			1

the researchers posted similar photos of the devices being held by white and black men @entity11 researchers posted 1,200 classified adverts in over 300 areas of the @entity11 between march 2009 and march 2010 , to test for racial bias among buyers by featuring similar photos of the @entity9 held by a man ’s hand that was wither black , white or white with a wrist tattoo			1
the experiment found black sellers receive 13 per cent fewer responses , 18 per cent fewer offers and the money offered was 12 per cent lower than that offered to a white seller			1
white sellers with wrist tattoos were found to have similar responses and offers			2
in the study , published in the @entity49 of the @entity50 , buyers interacting with black sellers behaved in ways that suggested they trusted them less			1
they were 17 per cent less likely to include their names , 44 per cent likely to agree to a proposed delivery by mail and 56 per cent more likely to express concern about making a long distance payment			0

the researchers placed their adverts among over 300 local classified ad websites with an average of 15.7 other adverts for @entity84 listed the previous week			0
in more crowded markets , with over 20 @entity9 adverts , black sellers received the same number of offers and equal best offers relative to white sellers			2
but black sellers suffered ‘ particularly poor ’ outcomes in markets with fewer products on sale , where they received 23 per cent fewer offers and best offers were 12 per cent lower			1
the news comes after a recent study that found a person 's race is still a major factor when picking a partner			0
research examining the preferences of a dating app found black men and women receive fewer responses to their messages ( graphic of results , pictured ) the study also found that black sellers do worst in markets with high property crime rates and more racially segregated housing , suggesting that at least part of the explanation is ‘ statistical discrimination ’ - where race is used as a proxy for unobservable negative characteristics – rather than simply ‘ taste - based ’ discrimination , professor @entity59 explained			1
however , ‘ it is also possible that bias against black sellers is higher in high - crime or high - isolation markets , ’ she said			2
the researchers also found evidence that black sellers do better in markets with larger black populations , ‘ suggesting that the disparities may be driven , in part , by buyers ’ preference for own - race sellers , ’ according to the study			2
‘ we believe our study isolates the effect of race on market outcomes more convincingly than previous studies and provides some insight into why buyers are discriminating , ’ professor @entity59 said			0
