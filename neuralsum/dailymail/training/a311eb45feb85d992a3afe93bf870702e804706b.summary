@entity0 has explained why he declined the offer to appear in the book celebrating @entity5 's ' @entity4 ' season of 2003 - 04			1
@entity0 made a controversial switch to west @entity8 rivals @entity7 in 2006 - a move which angered @entity5 's fans , many of whom still refuse to forgive him			1
the book , released last october , featured interviews with a host of stars from that season , including @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , but not @entity0 - who has now explained why			1
@entity0 ( second right ) celebrates with @entity20 , @entity22 and @entity18 as @entity5 won the league title at @entity24 after a 2 - 2 draw with @entity26 @entity0 celebrates with the @entity28 trophy with @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 @entity0 said in a series of tweets that he will never forget his time at @entity5 members of the invincible side @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity22 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity39 gathered in @entity8 for a preview screening of ' @entity42 ' documentary on @entity43 he said on @entity44 : ' people asking why i 'm not in the @entity48 book i thought it would be for the best			1
i did n't think fans would want it			0
' but i will never forget my times at @entity5 and the amazing achievements i accomplished there with great people			2
' the book was written by journalist and life - long @entity5 fan @entity57			2
she tracked down and spoke to all members of the squad and management to talk about the unbeaten season			2
@entity0 , who was still playing for @entity7 at the time , turned down the chance to be interviewed for the book , and @entity65 thought it was due to the manner of his controversial switch from @entity69 to @entity8			1
@entity0 moved to @entity7 from @entity5 on transfer deadline day in 2006 @entity5 fans made mock £ 20 notes to wave at @entity0 when @entity5 played @entity7 as they accused him of moving for money @entity0 and @entity5 fans never really made up following his departure in 2006 @entity0 was offered a new contract by @entity5 on wages of £ 55,000 per week , but in his own book , my defence , the left back said the offer left him ‘ trembling with anger ’ as he had asked for £ 60,000 per week and felt the club were not that keen on keeping him if they were prepared to haggle over £ 5,000			1
@entity0 moved to @entity7 on transfer deadline day with the @entity86 offering a deal worth £ 90,000 - a - week and the move left a bad taste in the mouth for all concerned			1
manager @entity91 described the whole @entity0 saga as one of the regrets of his career			0
@entity0 had been earmarked by @entity20 to replace him as @entity5 captain and spend the whole of his career at the club			2
@entity91 says in the book that @entity0 left due to a misunderstanding between his agent and the club			1
in an interview with www.the42.ie , @entity65 said : ‘ when he left and went to @entity7 , there was a lot of bad feeling on @entity5 ’s part and on his part			2
i do n’t think he feels like he was treated well , and obviously @entity5 do n’t feel as if they were treated well			0
it was like a very messy divorce			0
‘ you ’d like to think with a bit of time , he could look back on that period and be proud of it			0
i ’m not sure he ’s ready to do that yet — he certainly was n’t ready while he was a @entity7 player			0
‘ perhaps in a few years ’ time when his career is over and he has a bit more distance , maybe he can recognise what he achieved			0
i would n’t be convinced it ’ll happen , but certainly the players spoke fondly of him and had a lot of affection for him as a person as well as a player			0
but there ’s obviously still a bit of a problem there			0
