by @entity1 reporter published : 09:00 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 10:16 est , 3 october 2013 the @entity3 hero who had his boat seized in april after finding the @entity6 bombing suspect hiding inside will has bought a new vessel with the help of donors across @entity10			1
@entity11 became a national figure after finding @entity13 inside his 22 - foot @entity14 on april 19 and a crowdfunding campaign quickly began to brim with donations thereafter in an effort to raise $ 50,000 so the @entity19 man could buy himself a new boat			1
that goal was met and then some			0
now , @entity11 has purchased a used vessel he modestly calls a ' fixer - upper ' and plans to give the money left over to charity			1
overwhelmed : @entity11 calmly called 911 after finding @entity13 in his boat			1
he was quickly dubbed a hero , but the @entity28 quickly carted his beloved boat away ' we just recently , two weeks ago , got a used boat , ' @entity11 told @entity32			1
' we did accept [ the $ 50,000 ] and we did also request that anything over that went to the one fund			0
it just seemed right to do			0
' the one fund is a charity put in place to help victims of the savage april 15 attack and their families			2
the crowdsourced funds came from a site called @entity43			2
@entity44 dubbed the campaign ' let 's fix @entity11 's @entity47 in the @entity48 ) ! ' but that 's not precisely how it happened			1
sighted : @entity13 rises from @entity11 's boat with a laser sight on his forehead at the time of his capture sinking feeling : the suspected terrorist engaged authorities in a shootout that left the boat , dubbed slip away , riddled with holes generous : a campaign to replace @entity11 's boat quickly popped up on @entity62			1
just days after the campaign began , it had received $ 50,597.50 ' it was actually taken by the @entity28 , but that 's another thing , ' he said			1
donations began to flood in within days after @entity13 's capture , as did postcards and letters of thanks , which @entity11 found extremely touching			1
' you just want to ramble on you feel so grateful , ' @entity11 told @entity74			2
' after such a bad thing happened to us and the people of @entity6 , it was wonderful to see that			0
' by april 30 , the fund exceeded its goal			0
thanks to a large donation from the @entity86 boat company , @entity11 received exactly $ 50,597			2
' it restores your faith in people , ' he said			0
' they do n't know me			0
' @entity11 named his new boat after his wife , dubbing it @entity95			2
his old boat was called @entity97			0
' that 's fitting , is n't it ? ' he laugh			0
' we decided we 're just going to let slip away slip away			0
' history : @entity11 said that he saw a ' good amount ' of blood in the cabin , and then a body			0
he calmly called 911 and the rest is history ... along with the boat @entity13 emerges wounded , bloody , and dazed from the boat			1
now that @entity97 has slipped away , @entity11 has purchased a used boat he calls @entity112			2

@entity11 was *hailed* a hero after ' calmly ' calling 911 when he found @entity13 inside his 22 - foot @entity116 *cruiser* in april 19
a shootout *ensued* , *ending* in @entity13 's capture and the seizure of @entity11 's *bullet* - riddled boat
a crowd - sourcing *fundraiser* on @entity43 raised $ 50,597.50 , so @entity11 bought a new boat and is giving the rest to charity
