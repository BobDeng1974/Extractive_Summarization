by @entity0 published : 11:33 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 11:36 est , 19 july 2013 girls should be ‘ disruptive ’ in class as challenging authority will help them in their careers , according to the boss of a leading private school group			2
dr @entity9 , head of innovation and learning at the @entity12 ’ @entity7 , which runs 26 schools , said it was common for girls to be praised for good manners , politeness and even neat written work			1
but it would be more ‘ empowering ’ for young women to question what they are told and take risks , he said			1
disruptive : girls should not be encouraged to be polite but learn to challenge authority , dr @entity9 said ( file picture ) girls now outperform boys at every stage of their education , from primary school exams to gcses and a-levels and are more likely to attend university and graduate with a good degree			1
however men earn around 10 per cent more than women , recent figures showed , and dr @entity9 warned that praising girls for their politeness , neatness and balanced well thought - out essays may be counterproductive			1
in an article in the @entity43 , he questioned whether the education system was ‘ doing girls a long - term disservice ’ by conforming to gender stereotypes of behaviour			2
dr @entity9 said ‘ of course , encouragement of ‘ misbehaviour ’ should only go so far			1
we do n’t want to motivate students to not value academic success			2
‘ but disruptiveness - as in the willingness to question , suggest alternatives , challenge , take risks , adapt and lead - can be very empowering			2
’ he quoted authors who claim that ‘ disruption is a proven path to success ’ suggesting that girls learn to ‘ challenge and influence authority ’			0
schools should alter their view of ‘ disruptiveness ’ as something to be discouraged , he said , instead embrace it as something ‘ not so very far from those of resourcefulness , resilience , enterprise , adventurousness , risk - taking , determination , standing up for yourself , leadership and connectivity , which good schools do indeed seek to encourage and develop in girls			0
’ he praised a proposal at independent @entity81 in @entity82 to give sixth formers lessons in stand - up comedy to improve their risk - taking skills and show them how to ‘ think on their feet ’			0
last term pupils from single - sex @entity90 , a private girls school also in @entity82 , were taught about boasting , self - promotion and celebrating success as part of an innovative ‘ blow your own trumpet week ’			0
dr @entity9 said that other single - sex schools had promoted debating societies and encouraged pupils to sit tests with ‘ impossible questions ’ to get them to think in different ways			1
he argued : ‘ as testing in schools becomes ever more standardised , modularised and tick - box in form , we run the risk of inadvertently encouraging girls in their typically more measured , stepwise approach to tasks			0
‘ when we give higher marks to essays that show balance and give equal weight to opposing arguments , and praise girls who shine in set - piece performances , recitations and productions , we could be setting them up to fail when they face more competitive , combative situations such as interviews for selective universities			0
’ challenge : exams encourage girls to be too safe and give balanced answers instead being prepared for combative situations dr @entity9 has previously spoken out about the need for more male teachers in both boys and girls schools so children do not associate certain jobs with men or women			1
but the chief executive of the @entity138 , which regularly top the school league tables , made headlines last year by saying girls should work as hard at finding a good husband as on their careers			0
@entity143 , 63 , told the trust ’s annual conference girls should be ‘ ambitious ’ in their relationships just as they aspire to the top universities - as they need to find the right partner who ‘ shares the load at home ’ if they want to have it all , a career , marriage and motherhood .			0

dr @entity9 said young women should be empowered to take risks
praising them for politeness fails to equip them for later life
