this amazing 125 - foot tall chasm is actually just one of a number of stunning rooms and passages in an abandoned mine in @entity14			1
the shots were taken during a caving - camping trip by photographer @entity17 - and capture the stark beauty of this ancient free - stone quarry , located in the tiny town of @entity21			1
he descended into the dark depths with a fire - juggling friends @entity25 and @entity26 to cast a unique light around the interior of the mine , which is said to date back to @entity30			1
sparks fly : fire juggler @entity25 illuminated the yawning chasm of the ancient mine by juggling fire fireworks : fire juggler @entity36 casts haunting shadows around the gaping interior of the long abandoned @entity39 in @entity21 , @entity14 the ' cathedral ' chamber is an impressive 125 - feet tall , 120 - feet wide and 120 - feet long			1
in the early morning , when the photo was taken , the condensation from the stone creates an eerie mist			0
the @entity46 was worked since the @entity30 era , reaching it peak stone production in the 19th century , until it was abandoned in 1968			1
it was progressively enlarged over the years and now has more than 90km of passages divided into three sections - northern , central and southern			2
according to @entity53 , it retains many impressive features such as tools , work benches , cranes and wells			0
subterranean : explorers in the ' cathedral ' chamber of the @entity39 in @entity21 , @entity14 , shine a torch towards to small opening to the world above cavernous : the enormous ' cathedral ' chamber of the @entity39 measures 125 feet tall , 120 feet wide and 120 feet long it is a mecca for brave explorers and professional cavers , but only five to 10 secret entrances are used by them			1
it is also a designated @entity74 due to the number of bat species which reside in the mine			0
caving in such an environment can be incredibly dangerous unless you are very experienced , according to mr @entity17 , as there are scores of open wells littered about and if you do n't have adequate lighting - they could be fatal			2
he said : ' as long as you have all the right gear and lighting - lighting is vital - you 're fine			2
but you have to be experienced too and always wear a hard hat			0
' there are open wells scattered about and i 'm not sure how deep they are but you ca n't see the bottom			0
' my explorer friends and i went to the @entity94 last month and some even camped down there with tents and had barbecues			0
' one of my friends is a juggler so he juggled fire down there			2
' hungry work : explorers barbecue some food while camping at @entity39 in @entity21 , @entity14 shaft of light : explorers in the ' cathedral ' peer up at the tiny gap in the rock which lead to the surface and out of @entity39 in @entity21 , @entity14 the descent : explorers make their way to the small hole in the forest floor which will lead to the labyrinthine interior of @entity39 in @entity21 , @entity14 according to @entity17 , the quarry is slowly collapsing so explorers have to be aware of that too			1
he said : ' it 's caving in over time so you have to check the state of the rock and make decisions about which routes are unwise to take			0
@entity17 added : ' but i love the excitement and the sheer size of places like this			0
' abandoned places like this really inspire me to take photos of places that most people will never see			0
