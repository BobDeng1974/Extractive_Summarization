@entity0 is not known for his scoring prowess but the bearded wonder leaves @entity3 rooted to the foot of the @entity5 thanks to his second - half header			1
@entity8 rang out at the end after yet another decent performance had nothing to show for it			0
it was a statement of the obvious but @entity14 ’s programme notes confirmed it in black and white			1
the matches against the clubs hovering round the relegation zone ‘ are the ones that will probably be decisive in our season			2

having beaten both @entity79 and @entity80 since @entity81 , it could be argued that his team have got the message despite the continuing danger of anger of being cast adrift at the bottom of the table			1
if only @entity89 results counted in the @entity5			1
@entity3 have knocked out top flight opposition in @entity91 and @entity92 and next weekend bid to make it a hat - trick against @entity79			1
sadly , back in the real world , it has been a season of toil for @entity14 ’s players , not helped by a dismal home record of two wins in the league			1
the @entity103 owners continue to back their manager , to the extent that he was able to splash out a record £ 9.7million on striker @entity47 , who was named substitute			0
this was an opportunity to sign off from the @entity109 in style – a quirk of the fixture list plus @entity115 ’s @entity114 final means that the next time the @entity117 are at home is the middle of march			2
first on the agenda was avoiding a third straight league defeat against a side who have been resurgent under @entity124			0
the bandwagon hit a pot hole last week when @entity127 mugged @entity32 and left south @entity128 with all three points			1
@entity124 ’s 100 per cent win record suffered a first dent but they still started this match in 13th place and with 23 points safely gathered in			0
confidence has risen and the way @entity32 started proved that			2
the first 10 minutes was all about the visitors with @entity60 looking to join striker @entity29 at every opportunity			0
decent build - up play did not equate to a real threat on @entity36 ’s goal , though , and gradually @entity3 came into the game			1
@entity3 goalkeeper @entity36 was unable to keep out @entity0 's headed effort @entity3 striker @entity46 came close to scoring for @entity3 however his header hit the woodwork chief tormentor @entity45 has been at the @entity148 with @entity149			1
from the heat of @entity151 to the chill of the @entity153 but @entity45 ’s only concession to the cold was gloves with his short - sleeved short			0
more importantly , he looked in hot form and was at the centre of most of @entity3 ’s attacking moves			2
twice he set up @entity46 only for the striker to slice his shot - come - chip over and then @entity46 headed @entity45 ’s corner against the bar			0
and when the winger tried a shot himself , @entity54 did his job in the @entity32 goal before @entity56 blocked @entity46 ’s follow - up			1
@entity54 , in his bright green kit , was far the busier goalkeeper and kept his team on even terms with a stop to deny @entity42			0
as the home side launched attack after attack , @entity56 and @entity40 both went up in an aerial challenge and cracked heads			0
both went down pole - axed and it was no surprise when @entity56 failed to reappear for the second half			0
@entity124 made two substitutions and both were involved in @entity32 ’s opener			2
having lived dangerously when @entity41 ’s low shot skimmed a post , the visitors hit back			0
sub one , @entity189 , who forced a block from @entity39 , won a corner , which was taken by @entity29			0
sub two , @entity21 , used his height to head @entity29 ’s flag kick back across the area and @entity0 got the final touch for only his second league goal of the season			1
@entity3 had a chance to equalise immediately but @entity44 paid the price for dithering and his shot was cleared			2
@entity54 turned out to be just as busy in the second half as the first and made one world - class stop from @entity38 right at the end			0

@entity0 scored in the 55th minute to ensure the @entity32 claimed all three points against @entity3
the @entity269 *international* leaped above @entity3 's defence to score his second goal of the season
@entity3 remain adrift at the bottom of the @entity5 table having won just four league games
the foxes face tough games against @entity280 , @entity115 and @entity281 in *upcoming* weeks
@entity14 appeared to put his hands around the throat of @entity32 midfielder @entity22
