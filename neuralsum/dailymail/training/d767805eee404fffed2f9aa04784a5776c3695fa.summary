' @entity28 ' : 83 year - old @entity9 leaves @entity29 today after being found guilty of breaching a restraining order and told she may face jail the soldier , who can not be named to protect the identity of his children , said he had been awarded eight medals for service , but would ‘ gladly give them up ’ if he could guarantee peace for his family			1
harassment : @entity9 , 83 , launched a shocking campaign against a young family after a child 's football landed in her garden he feared they would never sell their home because he would feel ‘ honour - bound ’ to tell buyers about @entity9			1
@entity9 ’s campaign began when a football landed in her garden shortly after the family moved in to the house in @entity53 , @entity54 , in 2011			1

but just 24 hours later , the former @entity68 base stores worker committed the first of four breaches of the order			0
the grandmother yesterday returned to the court to deny the breaches			0
@entity9 told magistrates that far from taunting the family with songs about the soldier ’s fate in @entity19 , she was singing her favourite hymns , @entity81 but magistrates – who branded her ‘ not credible ’ – convicted her of the four breaches			1
chairman of the bench @entity85 told @entity9 , who followed the proceedings with a hearing aid : ‘ we are leaving all our options open including prison , or the case being sent to the @entity91 where the sentencing powers are far greater			1
’ the case was adjourned to january 23			0
abusive : the pensioner would pass the house ans swear at the house , as well as sing vile songs and abuse her neighbour about the death of her baby and that she hoped her husband would be killed in action the court heard @entity9 regularly insulted the mother with songs she had made up , and began setting off her own burglar alarm and banging on the walls to prevent the children from sleeping			1
magistrates took just an hour to convict @entity9 yesterday			2
she declined to apologise or comment as she left court			0
@entity9 married the same man , @entity111 , three times , with the couple splitting twice – apparently over her combustible personality			2

i told her to get back on her broomstick and get lost			0
’ a friend of the victims said they were ‘ very happy ’			0
he added : ‘ they say that it shows that people who complain of harassment will be listened to			0

pensioner @entity9 ' waged psychological warfare ' and said she hoped her soldier husband died in @entity19
it all started because the couple 's young children kicked a football into her garden
the 83 - year - old *repeatedly* swore at the house as she passed
she was handed a restraining order this year only to breach it a day later
magistrates warn today she may go to prison for her ' vile ' abuse
