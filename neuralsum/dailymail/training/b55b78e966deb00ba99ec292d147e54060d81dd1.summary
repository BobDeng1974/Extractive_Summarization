by @entity0 published : 15:36 est , 31 august 2013 updated : 23:50 est , 31 august 2013 the @entity1 announced saturday they have released the immensely popular @entity2 a week before the @entity4 season begins			1
known as much for his faith , his charity work and for ' @entity7 , ' as much as he was for his on - field performance , @entity2 might have finally seen his last @entity4 opportunity slip through his fingers			1
@entity2 rose to prominence as one of the greatest quarterbacks in college football history and his outspoken @entity16 faith , which earned him the nickname ‘ @entity2 ’ during his time with the @entity19			1
last game : @entity2 played for the @entity1 on friday but has now been cut tebowing : former @entity19 quarterback @entity2 prays near the endzone during the 2011 season already a household name before he graduated from the @entity27 after winning two national titles and the @entity29 as the sport ’s best player in 2007 , @entity2 ’s candid talk about his faith and never - ending charity work converted legions of fans to ‘ @entity34			1
’ @entity2 was in the @entity4 spotlight long before he even donned a pro uniform			1
the most high - profile player in college sports , @entity2 often inscribed biblical verses into his eye black , such as ‘ @entity41 , ’ causing the term to be searched over 94 million times on @entity44 , according to @entity45			1
best in the land : @entity27 quarterback @entity2 won the 2007 @entity29 twice as nice : @entity2 won two national championships as quarterback of the @entity50 @entity51 3:16 : one of @entity2 's most preferred bible passages , he inscribed it into his eye black for the 2009 @entity55 - which his team won when told of the searches , @entity2 replied ‘ that just kind of showed me , wow , the impact , i could wear something under my eyes and millions of people were going to @entity44 it			1
i really had a platform			0
i wanted to take advantage of that for one more year , be a good role model for the kids that look up to me , ’ when announcing his decision to return to college for his senior year			0
the @entity75 soon implemented a rule against allowing messages in eye black , which media dubbed the ‘ @entity80			0
’ in a trend that started in college and carried over to the @entity4 , @entity2 began every press conference by saying ' first i 'd like to thank my lord and savior , @entity87			1
' also made public in college was his firm commitment to abstinence until marriage , a pledge @entity2 has kept at least until now , he 's 26 - years - old			1
@entity2 often cited bible versus throughout his college career			2
after a lopsided defeat during the 2009 season @entity2 answered a reporter 's question with @entity51 16:33			1
' these things i have spoken unto you , that in me ye might have peace			0
in the world ye shall have tribulation : but be of good cheer - i have overcome the world			0
' @entity2 is famous for ' @entity7 , ' an act where the player dropped to one knee and prayed in the corner of the end zone after each game , became a national phenomenon and took social media by storm - with thousands taking pictures mimicking the pose everywhere imaginable			1
' the greatest form of flattery is imitation , but i think that just that prayer is being talked about is pretty cool , ' @entity2 told @entity125			2
a shocker : many were astounded when the @entity19 picked @entity2 25th overall in the first round of the 2010 @entity129 highly successful : the draft surprise was likely the result of winning two national titles an ad that aired during the @entity134 featured a woman talking about how she contracted an infection during a visit to the @entity138 while pregnant			1
the medicine she took to beat the infection would likely harm her unborn fetus , she remembered doctors saying			0
@entity143 , she gave birth to a healthy baby boy not long after – that boy was @entity2 , who then joined his mother on camera			0
picked 25th overall by the @entity19 in the first round of the @entity151			0
@entity2 was cheered by casual fans and religious devotees , but football experts doubted his ability to be a successful @entity4 quarterback due to an unusual throwing motion and streaky accuracy			1
that the team traded away three other draft picks to get the maligned qb , mattered little to coach @entity162			0
‘ he has all the traits you look for			0
it 's a good pick , ’ @entity162 said of @entity2			2
@entity2 set an @entity4 record before even stepping onto the field , by logging the highest draft weekend jersey sales tally in league history , according to @entity173			1
played sparingly his rookie season in 2010 , @entity2 entered halfway through the team ’s fifth game of the 2011 season and almost led them to a furious comeback win			1
he was anointed the ‘ @entity2 ’ when he was announced as the starter for the next game			0
trailing 15 - 0 with about three minutes left in the game , @entity2 began one of the most improbable runs in league history by leading the team to an 18 - 15 overtime win over the @entity188			0
another bible verse : though he most - often selected @entity51 3:16 , @entity2 also picked other bible verses to inscribe into his eye black the team then decisively won their next two games before miraculously pulling off three come - from - behind wins in a row and somehow putting them into the playoffs			2
the @entity19 then knocked the defending champion @entity198 out of the playoffs when @entity2 threw a jaw - dropping 80 - yard touchdown pass on the first play of overtime to win the game			1
amazingly , @entity2 finished with 316 passing yards on 10 completions , for an @entity4 - record 31.6 yards per catch			2
even more curiously , the numbers matched the bible verse religious signal caller often inscribed in his eye black while playing in college			0
also known for his overwhelming amount of charity work , @entity2 that would be the last touchdown pass @entity2 would throw in the @entity4			2
the @entity19 lost their next game and traded him to the @entity214			0
though he arrived with much fanfare , and was likely the only backup quarterback with an underwear ad over the @entity220 , his stay in @entity216 was short - lived – he was cut from the team at season ’s end			2
last stand : @entity2 playing erratically in a @entity1 uniform during the 2013 preseason might be the last image of the polarizing player in the @entity4 weekly ritual : if @entity2 's career is over , he ended it the same way he does every game , leading a prayer circle made up of players from both sides at the end of every game despite backing up a historically - inept quarterback , @entity2 saw limited action and his tenure went largely unnoticed outside of a controversial church he planned to speak at and then backed away after public outcry			1
@entity2 signed with the @entity1 prior to the start of training camp for the 2013 season , but with his release today – one week before the season begins – it looks like @entity34 may finally be over , despite the maligned player ’s determination to be an @entity4 quarterback			1
during his short time with the @entity1 , it was revealed by a longtime scout appearing on a @entity255 radio show that a @entity257 team was considering drafting @entity2 shortly after he graduated college			2
which team ? the ( @entity261 ) @entity260 , or course			0
thanking the @entity1 owners and coaches , @entity2 tweeted saturday afternoon to his almost 2.4million followers ‘ i pray for nothing but the best for you all			0
i will remain in relentless pursuit of continuing my lifelong dream of being an @entity4 quarterback			2
' he then , as always , ended with a bible verse			0
this time it was 2 @entity273 12:9			0
‘ my grace is sufficient for you , for power is perfected in weakness			0

@entity2 won two national titles in college as quarterback of the @entity50
@entity2 also won the @entity29 as college football 's greatest player during the 2008 season
he played for three @entity4 teams , most notably the @entity19
@entity2 is known as much for his outspoken @entity16 *beliefs* as he is his performance on the field
his dropping to one knee in the corner of the end zone after games *spawned* ' @entity298 ' craze
