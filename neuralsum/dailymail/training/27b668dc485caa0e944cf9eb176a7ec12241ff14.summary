by @entity0 despite food shortages in rural areas , reports of concentration camps and rising tensions between it and its neighbours , @entity1 is a wonderful place to be - according to its rulers at least			1
now the ridiculous nature of their claims has been laid bare by a series of @entity17 videos created by @entity19 photojournalist , @entity18			0
from bleak country dwellings covered in peeling paint to a girl eating lunch under a television showing a military parade , it offers a rare look at the realities of life inside the @entity30			0
despite travelling with a government ' minder ' , @entity18 's images paint a shocking portrait of life inside the communist country - one that is entirely at odds with the official version			0
' [ @entity1 ] is an endlessly fascinating and visually surreal place , but it is also one of the hardest countries i have ever photographed , ' writes @entity18 in a @entity57 blog for the @entity19			1
' as one of the few international photographers with regular access to the country , i consider it a huge responsibility to show life there as accurately as i can			0
' few foreigners , he adds , are allowed to leave the showpiece capital , @entity33 , while the presence of minders makes getting photos of anything that does n't toe the official line almost impossibly hard			0
propaganda : billboards pushing the ' @entity76 ' way of life are seen everywhere in @entity1 inescapable : the military is all pervasive even at a festival dedicated to ' @entity81 ' and ' @entity83 ' flowers @entity84 : a girl eats under a tv showing more military might while in rural areas , people live in extreme poverty that @entity18 has managed to get so many is an impressive feat , particularly as many reveal the all - pervasive influence of the country 's military as well as a rare shot of guards patrolling the border with @entity98			1
others show a surreal military conference where rows of identically dressed men clap perfectly in time , while others show grim @entity105 style apartment blocks and equally grim looking soldiers standing guard beside the @entity109 rocket at @entity110 in @entity111			1
' my window on @entity1 is sometimes , quite literally , a window â€“ of a hotel room , the backseat of a car , a train , ' adds @entity18			2
' @entity119 moments of daily life present themselves suddenly , and they are opportunities to show a side of the country that is entirely at odds with the official portrait of marching troops and tightly coordinated pomp that the @entity33 leadership presents to the world			0
' desolate : @entity1 's rural areas are utterly grim while the @entity98 border is yet another military zone stalinist : @entity1 calls itself a socialist utopia but in reality operates similarly to the @entity136 the @entity137 , which ended almost exactly 60 years ago on the 27th july 1953 , brought the @entity139 dynasty to power and set the scene for decades of tension between it and its southern neighbour			1
on the country 's official website , @entity1 authorities describe the country as ' the @entity76 - oriented socialist state which embodies the idea and leadership of comrade @entity152 , the founder of the @entity153 and the father of socialist @entity1			2
' in reality , @entity1 is home to the world 's last @entity157 regime and it shares many characteristics with the @entity136 , not least a marked penchant for secrecy			0
more recently , the regime 's pursuit of nuclear arms has brought it into conflict with @entity167 powers - the @entity168 in particular - while relations with its main ally , @entity171 , appear increasingly lukewarm			2
currently , tension centres around the @entity109 rocket programme , which could , if developed further , eventually develop a long enough range to make a strike on @entity176 possible			2
while the country is yet to fire a missile in anger , @entity1 leader @entity177 threatened the @entity168 with a pre-emptive nuclear strike in march , describing the @entity168 as the ' sworn enemy of the @entity1 people			1
' the regime also pulled out of the 1953 armistice with @entity98 and said they would end all mutual non-aggression pacts			0
although the regime has since backtracked and has opened talks with its southern neighbour , @entity187 increase its defence budget for the first time in decades , while the @entity168 has threatened to defend itself if necessary			1
truce : then @entity1 leader @entity152 signs an armistice treaty to end the @entity137 on 27th july 1953 treaty : the @entity1 ripped up the document that ended the war in march but have since backtracked			1

clips reveal *terrifying* extent of military *oppression* in @entity1
also reveal desolate living conditions and endless *blackouts*
*footage* of the @entity109 *ballistic* missile also *included* in the film
in march , @entity1 threatened a nuclear strike on the @entity168
it has since backtracked but neighbouring countries remain *uneasy*
