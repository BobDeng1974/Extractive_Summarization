the @entity1 's first forensic science regulator claims that human error , partial prints and false positives mean that fingerprints evidence is not as reliable as is widely believed human fingerprints may not be unique , according to the @entity1 's first @entity0			1
this cornerstone of criminal investigation and identification may be flawed , as @entity11 claims that human error , partial prints and false positives mean that fingerprints evidence is not as reliable as is widely believed			1
mr @entity11 , who introduced the first automated fingerprint detection system to the @entity14 , said : ' no two fingerprints are ever exactly alike in every detail ; even two impressions recorded immediately after each other from the same finger			1
' and the fingerprint often is n't perfect , particularly at a crime scene			2
it might be dirty or smudged			2
there are all sorts of things that reduce the accuracy			2
' and not everyone 's fingerprints have been recorded so it 's impossible to prove that no two are the same			1
' it 's improbable , but so is winning the lottery , and people do that every week			0
' other factors which can reduce the ' uniqueness ' of finger prints include certain skin conditions which can make the fingertips smooth , and elderly people 's skin changing in elasticity			1
families also share extremely similar patterns			0
mr @entity11 stressed that juries are should be made better informed of these caveats , and said : ' i think it is important that juries are aware of this			1
' too often they see programmes like @entity52 and that raises their expectations			0
what you see on csi or @entity57 simply does n't exist			0
he added that the same logic could be applied to the assumption that all dna is unique , as this claim is impossible to prove			0
a police officer uses a mobile finger print analyser on a suspect incorrect fingerprint evidence has led to several cases of innocent people being wrongly linked to criminal cases			0
in 2004 , @entity70 , was wrongly linked to the @entity72 train bombings by @entity74 fingerprint experts in the @entity75 and @entity76 , a @entity77 police officer , was wrongly accused of having been at a murder scene in 1997 after a print supposedly matching hers was found near the body .			0

@entity11 *blames* human error , partial prints and false positives
he says they mean fingerprints are not as reliable as is widely believed
mr @entity11 stressed that juries are should be made better informed
