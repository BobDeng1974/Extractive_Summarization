@entity0 has said ' a lot of white politicians ' prefer to keep silent about the segregation of our communities for fear of being dubbed racist			1
the former @entity9 home secretary said it was the responsibility of politicians to get such issues out in the open , but said there was a ' polite society ' which meant that such issues are not talked about			1
and @entity16 , the former @entity9 mp for @entity17 , said it had been difficult for her to raise the issue of grooming by @entity22 men in her @entity24 constituency ' without being called a racist '			1
@entity0 , @entity9 mp for @entity25 has said ' a lot of white politicians ' prefer to keep silent about the segregation of our communities for fear of being dubbed racist she said friends of hers in the @entity30 had known about the abuse for years , but said nothing about it			1
the two politicians made their comments on a documentary to be screened on thursday and presented by @entity37 , the former chairman of the @entity38			1
it comes days after mr @entity40 said in an article that @entity42 is silencing debate on race issues by ' intimidating ' those who dare to ask questions			1
he said far too many people felt unable to speak their minds out of a fear they would be branded racist , and that people would have to become ' more ready to offend each other ' as the price of free speech			2
the comments come 10 years after he warned that @entity42 was ' sleepwalking to segregation ' – comments which attracted a welter of criticism			2
but one politician who did not condemn the comments at the time was mr @entity0 , home secretary from 1997 and 2001 and foreign secretary until 2006			1
the mp for @entity25 , one of @entity42 's most segregated constituencies , said : ' it is a fact of life that people tend to want to live where people like them live			2
' if you got a map i could say the people in that area some from this part of @entity79 , the people in that area come from another @entity79 area but not very far away by the way , and this is a @entity83 area and these people come from here and these people come from there , ' he said			0
asked mr @entity37 why it is that the @entity42 is not comfortable talking about segregation , mr @entity0 said : ' there is a sort of polite society in which people are n't comfortable about talking about this			1
' but i think that in politics you have a responsibility to get things out in the open			0
i am concerned about the effects of people living wholly separate lives of course , but you ca n't direct where people live			0
' @entity16 , the former @entity9 mp for @entity17 , said it had been difficult for her to raise the issue of grooming by @entity22 men in her @entity24 constituency ' without being called a racist ' mr @entity37 then asked him why he thinks there is ' essentially such a silence on these questions '			1
mr @entity0 said : ' i think that a lot of white politicians are nervous about this			2
they lack confidence about what their views are – and think that somebody will criticise them if they come out with them			0
' when mr @entity37 suggested : ' somebody will call them racist ? ' , mr @entity0 replied : ' racist or some nonsense like that			2
' mrs @entity16 also spoke to the programme about how she felt ' politically inhibited ' when she tried to raise the subject of child grooming in her @entity17 constituency in 2002			1
' it was difficult for me to make these arguments without being called a racist , ' she said			1
' and i just could n't interest either @entity140 or @entity141 , and it was very distressing for me , so the last resort was to go public			0
' she said the victims of abuse were aged 12 or 13 , but neither the mothers or the girls themselves could get any interest from the local police			0
' their mothers knew what was going on , that there was sexual activity with girls who were underage , ' she said			0
' not entirely – but nearly always – the gangs are from the @entity158 @entity83 community			0
' these seven women were saying : ' it 's not fair , we 've told @entity141 about it			0
we 've told @entity140 about it and no one will do anything			0
' totally absurd : i mean , friends of mine in the @entity30 , they 'd known about it for years and they never mentioned it to me			0
' mr @entity37 ' documentary , things we ca n't @entity174 , is on @entity175 on thursday at 9pm .			0
