former officers warned that withdrawing @entity3 from his military role would be ' playing into the hands of the @entity11 ' , granting the opposition a morale - boosting propaganda victory			1
concerns have heightened over the @entity3 's deployment since friday night 's attack , in which two @entity22 were killed and four @entity24 airmen were seriously wounded			1
the intense three - hour fire - fight was followed by the killing of two @entity24 soldiers by a man wearing @entity4 police uniform in a separate incident			1
the soldiers , from @entity33 the @entity32 , were killed at a checkpoint in the south of @entity38 - e @entity37 district in @entity39			2
@entity3 , an @entity40 captain , is based at @entity6 for his second tour of duty , due to last four months			1
@entity43 officials said the attack on @entity6 was by heavily - armed insurgents and involved a range of weaponry , including mortars , rockets or rocket - propelled grenades , as well as small arms fire			1
the @entity11 said it carried out the attack because @entity3 was on the base , and also as revenge for an internet video that mocks the @entity56			1
@entity11 spokesman @entity57 said : ' we attacked that base because prince @entity3 was also on it and so they can know our anger			1
' he added : ' thousands more suicide attackers are ready to give up their lives for the sake of the @entity56			0
' @entity67 mp colonel @entity66 , a former commander of @entity24 troops in @entity69 , dismissed suggestions that @entity3 should be withdrawn because of the attack			1
' to hell with them , ' he said			0
' @entity3 wants to go there and our soldiers want him there			2
' these things are n't set in concrete , ' he said			0
' if circumstances really change then we 'll make different judgments			0
' col @entity93 added : ' capturing , killing or hurting prince @entity3 would be a huge propaganda coup for the @entity11			1
' major @entity95 , a former infantry officer and editor of @entity99 publication , warned against the dangers of ' playing into the hands of the @entity11 '			2
he said : ' on balance it is a difficult equation but i think he should be kept there			0
' if we take him away the @entity11 will crow that they have just scored a major victory			1
@entity109 : @entity3 is based at @entity6 for his second tour of duty , due to last four months ' the second point is it would affect the morale of the troops on the ground if prince @entity3 was taken out just because there was a threat			1
' maj @entity95 added that it was not the first time @entity6 had been targeted			1
' the @entity11 have been doing these things for five years now , ' he said			2
' @entity6 is a huge complex			2
it is really a military city			0
' this is one of those pinprick attacks that went right as they killed two @entity22			1
but in most of them no one gets hurt			0
' a @entity129 spokesman said : ' the threat to all our service personnel is continually assessed and all measures taken to mitigate it			0
' as we stated last week , the deployment of captain @entity136 has been long planned and the threat to him and others around him thoroughly assessed			0
' we stated that any risk posed by his deployment , based on the capability , opportunity and intent of the insurgency , is continually reviewed			0
' the prince last night told his commanding officers he was ' staying put '			2
he insisted to superiors that he was ‘ fine ’ and was determined to carry out his duties as an @entity154 helicopter pilot			1
military sources told @entity156 the attack must have been planned days , if not weeks in advance in order to gain access to the heavily fortifed base and get to ‘ within 400 yards ’ of @entity3			1
the insurgents are believed to have studied @entity6 beforehand and passed unnoticed through vehicle checkpoints before recovering a cache of weapons hidden in the desert			2
at about 10pm local time on friday , 16 fighters dug beneath a perimeter fence on the camp ’s eastern side and ran towards the airfield , where they were challenged by @entity22			2
they fired rocket - propelled grenades and rifles , killing the two @entity22 and destroying aircraft including harrier jets and @entity177 helicopters			1
at this stage 50 @entity24 and @entity43 personnel , including airmen from the @entity181 ’s @entity180 , were scrambled to the airfield			1
the gun battle continued for three hours with the @entity11 desperate to reach @entity3 ’s accommodation and a @entity24 airstrip where his @entity154 helicopter was standing idle			1
the @entity3 was rushed to safety as the @entity11 closed in			1

the four @entity24 casualties were also treated for gunshot wounds			2
a military source said : ‘ this was a very well planned and executed attack			1
the logistics involved in order to get inside a base with heavy weapons takes a lot of working out			0
so this is not something they just dreamed up in the space of a few hours			0
‘ from our point of view we do not know they are enemy until they take hostile action			0
they knew that and took precautions , reaching the fence surrounding @entity6 with their weapons concealed			2
‘ the investigation into the attack will look at whether the insurgents belonged to the @entity40			0
but if they were @entity40 they would probably have chosen a different method of entry to @entity6			2
‘ when the attack began @entity3 was with the other @entity154 crew members			1
he was not training , this was during his down - time			0
‘ he was accompanied by protection officers			2
