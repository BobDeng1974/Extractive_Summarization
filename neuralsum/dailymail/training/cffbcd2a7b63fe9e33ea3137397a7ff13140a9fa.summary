he told reporters : ' i 've been before ( to the city ) but today 's visit was a very brief one i 'm afraid			2
' i saw about 15 seconds of it			0
it 's quite tough to judge			2
some of the inhabitants are not all that friendly			0
i 'm sure that 's not the view of most			2
' the incident happened within seconds of mr @entity2 stepping out of his car and heading to meet @entity7 supporters in the city the incident came barely 24 hours after mr @entity2 faced claims of being a ' chicken ' for refusing to stand in a by - election in @entity74 he accused the media of whipping up a storm around the ' injudicious , or in a couple of cases , offensive comments from a handful of people ' after a series of damaging headlines about racist and sexist comments made by cancidates and supporters			1
' it 's whipped up this kind of storm of hatred among some on the left			0
' they 're organised , they 're taxpayer funded and they 're going around the country chasing me around trying to stop us from getting our message out			0
' that is a fundamentally anti-democratic thing to do			0
it 's not good and it 's not healthy			0
' later , when asked about allegations of racism , mr @entity2 said : ' it 's remarkable			1
you 've got 77 % of the @entity107 population in the @entity107 @entity108 , including over 60 % of first and second - generation migrants , who think we need border controls			0
' the truth of it is we now have an open door to 485 million people and i want to debate that over the course of the next three weeks			0
i tried with @entity27 to debate this issue - he ignored me			0
' @entity25 and @entity26 wo n't engage with it			0
but i think despite all the distractions , i think out there in the street people are debating it and the commonsense position is to say ' look , immigration sensiblycontrolled can be a positive thing for society and for our economy but we must have control over the quantity and quality of those that come to our country '			0
' we now have this farcical situation where if you 're a skilled person from @entity140 or @entity141 , you probably wo n't get in because we have an open door to @entity143 and @entity144 and that is absolutely mad from every perspective			0
' and i think with this we 're right at the centre of where the @entity107 public feels , and what we 're arguing for is actually very moderate , very logical , and for the establishment to come out and cry racist shows how devoid of any other argument they are			0
" mr @entity2 said @entity7 would give people back ' their pride and their country '			1
@entity158 confirmed a man from the city has been arrested on suspicion of assault			2

mr @entity2 was smiling for the cameras as the protestor approached him and hurled the egg mr @entity2 cowered as he was struck by the egg in front of a crowd of supporters several @entity7 visits have had to be scaled back or cancelled to avoid a clash with protesters mr @entity2 was quickly bundled into his official car before speeding off - and heading for a pub @entity7 supporters appeared alarmed by the drama which meant their party leader was quickly ferried away from the scene he threw away the chance to become an mp within weeks as he ruled himself out of being the @entity7 candidate			1
opponents accused the @entity7 leader of ' bottling it ' and being ' frit ' for not contesting the @entity197 seat of @entity74 vacated by shamed mp @entity198			1
@entity200 frontbencher @entity199 said : ' i 'm not surprised that @entity2 does n't want to fight in @entity74			2

' @entity197 defence minister @entity210 said on @entity211 : ' @entity212 is not stupid - he knows he 'd lose and runs frit from @entity74 !
