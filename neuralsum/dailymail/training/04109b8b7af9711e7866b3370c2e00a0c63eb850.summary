@entity12 was stunned when @entity6 blamed exorbitant medical costs for two ' distressed babies ' as the reason for the 401 ( k ) policy change and spoke out about the ' completely dehumanizing ' remarks over the weekend			1
however , last night she said @entity6 phoned her to apologize			1
he has also reversed the 401 ( k ) change and publicly admitted he ' made a mistake			1
' ' i really feel like he spoke to me ... not in his public role as ceo , he spoke to me in a heartfelt way as a father of three kids to a fellow parent , ' @entity12 told today			1

' @entity12 's husband , @entity45 , is executive business editor at @entity7 - owned @entity46			1

but she said she felt she needed to speak up to defend her daughter , who was born four months premature and spent three months in intensive care			2
' it did sound like the implication ( was ) that somehow we were greedy consumers of healthcare benefits , that we had gobbled up more than our share of the pie			2
it felt like an invasion of my family 's privacy and it felt like a dehumanization of my daughter			0
past problems : @entity69 has discovered @entity6 was accused of forcing a sales executive out when she was suffering a terrible pregnancy with quadruplets when he worked for @entity73 spotlight : @entity6 's views of women at work were put under scrutiny after he accused two mothers of ' distressed babies ' of being to blame for cutting @entity7 401 ( k ) benefits			1
they had their daughter , pictured shortly after birth , in october 2012			0
she was four months premature and spent three months in intensive care visit @entity86 for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy ' i felt like someone has to speak up for her			0
she ca n't tweet , you know , she ca n't go on tv to defend herself , she ca n't justify the spending that saved her life			0
she did n't deserve to get singled out in this way			0
' @entity12 said the experience ( of having a premature baby ) was so traumatic that even some of the couple 's closest friends did n't know what happened , until she spoke up in response to @entity6 's insensitive remarks			1
' when i saw the headlines , it was sort of impossible to process he was talking about my daughter , ' @entity12 told @entity111 last week of the moment she first heard @entity6 's controversial comments			1
' it ( was ) a violation - for singling us out for using the health plan we paid for			0
' @entity6 's policy changes would have switched 401 ( k ) matching contributions to an annual lump sum , rather than being distributed throughout the year with every paycheck			1
shocking : this gorgeous little girl was one of the ' distressed babies ' @entity7 chief @entity6 blamed for scaling back retirement savings plans shocked : @entity48 couple @entity12 ( left ) and @entity45 ( right ) are still in shock at the way @entity6 announced @entity7 's pension policy changes the switch would have cost employees who left mid-year and even those who stayed , since they would not see the benefits of compounding in their retirement accounts , @entity129 reported			1
but the embattled chief made matters worse when he tried to explain the controversial plan during an employee meeting last thursday			0
@entity6 told a story about two women covered by @entity7 who had complicated pregnancies , forcing the company to shell out $ 2 million ' above and beyond ' what was necessary			2
he said , with @entity148 potentially adding $ 7.1 million to @entity7 's costs in addition to the ' distressed babies ' , the company needed to find cost savings elsewhere and was forced to change 401 ( k ) to protect itself			1
@entity6 reportedly earned $ 12 million in 2012			2
the comments caused a publicity storm , with employees sending letters to @entity6 , and @entity46 giving it big coverage			2
@entity160 blew up with outraged users			0
big wigs : @entity45 executive business editor at @entity7 - owned @entity46 , holding his son and speaking with @entity165 as a result of the outcry , @entity6 apologized publicly and agreed to restore the original 401 ( k ) policy			1
' the leadership team and i listened to your feedback over the last week			0
we heard you on this topic , ' he wrote in an email to employees , according to @entity177			0
' and as we discussed the matter over several days , with management and employees , we have decided to change the policy back to a per - pay - period matching contribution			2
' however @entity12 , author of 2010 bestseller ' a thread of @entity185 ' , remained upset			2
she decided to pen a heartbreaking first - person article for @entity188 in which she recounted the painful birth of her now one - year - old daughter and reprimanded @entity6 for his thoughtless comments			1
writer : @entity12 is the author of 2010 novel , ' a thread of @entity185 ' ' i take issue with how he reduced my daughter to a ' distressed baby ' who cost the company too much money			1
how he blamed the saving of her life for his decision to scale back employee benefits , ' she wrote			2
' how he exposed the most searing experience of our lives , one that my husband and i still struggle to discuss with anyone but each other , for no other purpose than an absurd justification for corporate cost - cutting ... ' our daughter has already overcome more setbacks than most of us have endured in the span of our lives			0
having her very existence used as a scapegoat for cutting corporate benefits was one indignity too many			0
' in the harrowing piece , @entity12 explained how her little girl was born prematurely on october 9 , 2012 , with reddish - purple skin , bloody and bruised all over			2
' one doctor , visibly shaken , described it as " gelatinous , " ' she wrote			0
' i could n't hold my daughter or nurse her or hear her cries , which were silenced by the ventilator			0
without it , she could n't breathe			0
' doctors told the couple their daughter might not survive one month or one week or one day			0
she also had at least a one - third chance of being severely disabled			0
in the toughest months , the little girl suffered a brain hemorrhage , her right lung collapsed and one morning , she stopped breathing altogether			0
she spent three months in the @entity240 , enduring blood transfusions , head ultrasounds , the insertion of breathing tubes , feeding tubes , and a central line extending nearly to her heart			0
' because the day of her birth was the furthest thing from a happy event , because so many of her first days were lived under the specter of death , i 've never had the luxury of taking her presence for granted , ' @entity12 wrote for @entity188			1
' it can be a struggle to set aside my lingering trauma amid the daily realities of coordinating her care to simply celebrate the fierce , beautiful girl who has completed our family			0
' all of which made the implication from @entity6 that the saving of her life was an extravagant option , an oversize burden on the company bottom line , feel like a cruel violation , no less brutal for the ludicrousness of his contention			2

@entity48 mom , @entity12 , was stunned when @entity6 blamed her premature baby 's exorbitant medical costs for slashing 401 ( k ) benefits
she spoke out about the ' completely dehumanizing ' remarks in an article in @entity188 on the weekend
however , last night she said @entity6 phoned her to apologize . he has also reversed the 401 ( k ) change and publicly admitted he ' made a mistake '
' his apology was heartfelt and i appreciated it and i do forgive him , ' the mom - of - two said
