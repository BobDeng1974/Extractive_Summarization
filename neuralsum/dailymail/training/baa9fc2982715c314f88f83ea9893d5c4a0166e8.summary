what is it about the @entity3 and treasure hunts ? hint at something shiny , add an air of mystery — and we reach for our spades			1
that ’s what ’s happening on @entity14 ’s @entity13 beach this week , where wily @entity16 artist @entity15 has tapped deep into the @entity3 national character by hiding 30 miniature 24 - carat gold bars beneath the sand			1
he has upped the romance of it all by burying the bullion , worth £ 10,000 , between the high and low tidelines			1
cue dozens of people rushing down to the shore whenever the sea goes out			2
national obsession : hundreds flocked to @entity14 's @entity13 beach in search of bullion this week so far , just a handful of the bars are thought to have been discovered , with those successful including a trio from @entity36 — @entity37 , @entity38 and her sister @entity39 — and a local family			1
there ’s still plenty of gold in them thar sands			1
and the @entity14 hoard , part of an arts festival , is n’t the only treasure around			1
in @entity51 , a jeweller is staging a diamond hunt to raise money for cancer charity @entity54			1
ten genuine , if small , diamonds — worth £ 10,000 in total — have been hidden in obscure spots around the town			1
participants buy maps and clues to track them down , and the winners can have the stones made into their own unique piece of jewellery			2
in june this year , @entity68 property millionaire @entity67 was even more ambitious in the scale of his hunt , hiding cash in cities around the world and posting clues online			1
what he called ‘ a fun game that brings people together ’ caused such a fever that a park in @entity77 was ripped apart — the fences torn down by fortune seekers			1
the reaction was also intense in @entity83 , where crowds descended on @entity85 in search of envelopes containing £ 50 each			1
success : @entity38 , 26 , and @entity37 , 28 , from @entity36 , were among the lucky ones in @entity90 even writers are getting in on the act			2
@entity68 author @entity93 is offering £ 300,000 to the first reader who can crack the hidden code in his book @entity97 , published in the @entity3 next month			1
so , why does treasure hunting exert such a magnetic pull on us ? there ’s the money , of course			1
but it ’s more than that			2
these latest stunts play on a long history of real and fictional trails that have excited the @entity3 for more than 150 years			2
the most famous of all — and still the most influential — is that featured in @entity109 , written in 1883 by @entity110			2
the original treasure hunt : @entity109 had it all - one - legged seamen and an x that marked the spot his novel established many of the crucial elements of the traditional buried treasure adventure : @entity122 islands , one - legged seamen and — most importantly — a map with an x that marks the spot			1
it begins with the young hero @entity128 ( as in ‘ @entity129 , @entity130 ! ’ ) sifting through the contents of an old sailor ’s sea chest and finding a map of a faraway isle where the loot is hidden			2
the battle to find the haul is on			2
there had been other desert island stories before it , chief among them @entity144 ’s @entity142 , published in 1719 , which told of a castaway stranded on a @entity148 island for decades			2
there had been treasure stories , too , notably @entity152 ’s @entity151 , in 1843			1
in it , a man is bitten by a gold - coloured insect and becomes obsessed with finding treasure			1
deciphering a secret message , he ends up doing exactly that			0
@entity110 ’s genius was to combine these different elements into the ultimate tale of fortune - hunting			0
yet it was n’t just fiction that inspired him and sparked off our national obsession			0
real pirates such as @entity170 , who is mentioned in @entity109 , did in fact bury their loot			0
( @entity170 ’s booty , hidden on @entity173 in @entity174 , @entity175 , was dug up by the authorities			0
) the discoveries of the lost @entity179 cities of @entity180 , in 1738 , and @entity181 , in 1748 , and the valuables they held , also gripped the public imagination — as did the excavation of @entity187 ’s gold - filled tomb in @entity188 in 1922			1
indeed , much of early archaeology was driven by the search for lost riches			0
in the late 19th century , @entity197 , the @entity16 who excavated the ancient @entity194 cities of @entity195 and @entity196 , caused a stir by claiming to have dug up the gold mask of @entity194 hero @entity200 and jewels belonging to @entity202			1
in all likelihood , the treasure belonged to an even earlier civilisation			1
elusive : the gold bars hidden in @entity14			1
but why is @entity3 so obsessed with the idea of hidden plunder ? sometimes the riches have n’t been hidden so much as mislaid			0
ships loaded with precious cargo , have been sinking to the bottom of the ocean since man first took to the sea , and pirates , chancers and looters have been trying to retrieve it ever since			0
@entity110 ’s novel refers to a famous real - life salvaged wreck : the @entity224 , sunk off the coast of @entity226 in 1715 and later picked apart by pirates and opportunists			0
among them was a privateer ( a kind of government - approved mercenary ) called @entity234 , who made off with 350,000 pieces of eight			0
there are still prizes to be found			0
the greatest discovery of modern times is the @entity241 , @entity243 ’s warship , which sank in the @entity244 in 1545 while fighting the @entity245			0
in 1982 , her hull and 26,000 precious artefacts were raised from the seabed — not by pirates , but a charitable trust			0
the appetite for obscure clues has been around for a long time , too , with some still unsolved after centuries			0
in 1820 , prospector @entity254 buried gold and silver in @entity257 for safekeeping			1
he then gave three coded messages to a bar owner and promised to return with the key — but never did			0
modern times : the treasures of the @entity241 were recovered not by pirates but a charitable trust the bar owner , in turn , left the messages to a friend on his death			0
that friend deciphered one of them but found none of the treasure , thought to be worth £ 40 million today			1
people are still burrowing into the @entity257 hills in search of it			0
more recently , artist @entity278 used elaborate pictures in his 1979 book masquerade to give clues to the whereabouts of a hare - shaped jewel			1
after three years of frantic searching — during which time the book became a best - seller — it was discovered by a man called @entity289			0
he rushed down to its hiding place in @entity292 , the nation heard , to find a pile of earth dug up by two rivals who were agonisingly close to reaching the jewel — and whisked it from under their noses			0
@entity289 , however , turned out to be one @entity299 , who knew @entity278 ’s ex-girlfriend			0
she had accidentally revealed the rough location of the prize			0
despite not finding it in the expected way , he got to keep the hare , which was later sold at auction by @entity309 for £ 31,900			1
today we are still a country packed with treasure - hunters , but they ’re now aided by modern technology			2
in recent years , some staggering finds have been made , going back to the earliest @entity3 civilisations			0
in 2009 , the @entity316 — the largest haul of @entity319 gold and silver ever discovered — was dug up in a field near the village of @entity323			2
sensational : the @entity316 , found in 2009 , was the largest ever haul of @entity319 gold and silver the 3,500 pieces , reckoned to be from the seventh or eighth century @entity327 , are thought to have been buried by their owner with the intention of returning to claim them one day			2
there they lay until they were discovered by a metal - detector enthusiast searching a freshly - ploughed field			0
the following year , an exceptional @entity179 antiquity , a rare copper alloy helmet with a griffin crest , was unturfed by another metal detective in @entity340 , @entity341			0
it ’s thought the helmet had been hidden away in a stone box by an owner who , again , failed to return			0
these ancient treasures are far more valuable than the gold bars buried at @entity14			1
that @entity179 helmet was sold for £ 2.3 million , and the @entity316 has been valued at close to £ 3.3 million			2
if you want to track down a fortune , the only way forwards is backwards — start digging into the past .			0

artist @entity15 set the hares running with gold bars in @entity14
and in @entity51 , a jeweller is staging a £ 10,000 treasure hunt for charity
it comes after @entity365 game swept major cities and tore apart a park
