party membership has also risen dramatically , with the @entity33 claiming to have overtaken both the @entity34 and @entity35 , bolstered by a row over whether miss @entity6 should be included tv election debates			1
but after years in the political wilderness , few people know what the party stands for , beyond its environmental credentials			2
@entity2 policy states ' it should not be a crime simply to belong to an organisation or have sympathy with its aims , though it should be a crime to aid and abet criminal acts or deliberately fund such acts '			2
on @entity52 's @entity51 was challenged about the policy and whether that would make it legal for people living in @entity14 to join brutal terrorist groups such as @entity4			1
she said : ' this is a part of our policy that i think dates back to the age of the @entity64 and apartheid @entity65			0
' pressed on whether that meant it would be allowed to be a member of @entity5 or @entity70 , she said : ' exactly			0
what we want to do is make sure we are not punishing people for what they think or what they believe			0
' obviously actions of inciting violence , supporting violence , those are absolutely unacceptable , illegal and should be pursued to the full extent of the law			1
' she added : ' what we are talking about is a principle that you should n't be punished for what you think			0
and we need to balance , we do not protect freedom by destroying it			0
' security agencies warn @entity14 faces a severe threat posed by extremists inspired by @entity91 in @entity16 and @entity15 @entity94 will take part in tv election debates , the @entity93 chairman indicated yesterday			1
@entity97 said discussions were ' edging towards a solution ' and that the prime minister ' wants the debates to happen '			0
the move comes after broadcasters issued a ' take it or leave it ' warning that the debates – now involving seven parties – would go ahead with or without the pm			0
membership of @entity4 was formally banned when it became prescribed organisation last summer			1
security minister @entity109 said at the time : ' @entity111 is a useful weapon in the armoury at the disposal of the government , police and security service to disrupt terrorist activity and protect the @entity14			1

he said : ' we have to regard @entity4 as probably the greatest single immediate threat to @entity14 's national security at the moment			1
' there 's a very significant risk of an @entity4 - inspired attack being planned and , if we are not successful in intercepting it , executed by @entity4 sympathisers who live in the @entity14 but are inspired by what is going on in @entity16 and @entity15			1
' a @entity31 survey last week put the @entity33 on 10 per cent , up from 5 per cent when the @entity145 set up a unit designed to tackle the threat of the minor party a surge in support for the @entity2 cld cost @entity145 22 seats , a polling expert has warned			0

@entity159 of the @entity160 , carried out analusis of local election results 2010			0
it found 22 marginal seats @entity145 needs to win or cling on to where more than 10 per cent of voters are identified as being @entity145 / @entity167 - inclined			0

mr @entity159 told @entity177 : ' the voters fuelling the @entity167 boom share one characteristic with supporters of the @entity35 and @entity183 insurgencies – a deep - seated disaffection with the political establishment			1
' besides the general problem of disaffection , @entity145 also faces a specific problem with the @entity33 into political competition			0
' @entity191 , highly educated , cosmopolitan liberal idealists , @entity33 are more or less the polar opposite to @entity35 's ageing , socially conservative , nationalist electorate			2
@entity145 is losing votes to both , but any policy that appeals to one pole will anger those at the other			0
' mr @entity119 added : ' of course , our security and intelligence agencies , our police forces are working tirelessly around the clock to monitor , to identify , to intercept and to disrupt plots of this nature , and we 've been very successful in doing so , but we must n't be complacent			0
' we know there are people out there who wish us harm and we have to be vigilant and we have to work extremely hard to make sure we identify and disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack			2

on immigration policy , she said in the ' medium term ' the party 's policy was to progressively reduce @entity14 immigration controls			2
she added : ' what we want to do now is allow people who should have the right to be in the country , to be in the country			0
what we have to do is stop the race to the bottom on immigration rhetoric that we have been hearing , led by @entity35 and sadly followed by the other ( parties )			2
' people who should have a right to be here - which means asylum seekers and refugees - we are not treating them properly and we need to			2
' @entity14 people who want to live with a foreign , @entity259 spouse or partner here , on the government 's own figures 19,000 @entity14 ca n't live in their own country			1
' we saw last year the number of foreign students applying to @entity14 universities going down			2
' all of those are things that are causing real damage to people 's lives			0
' asked whether the party was committed to an ' open doors ' policy because it believed ' richer regions do not have the right to use migration controls ' she said the short - term policies would be those in the manifesto but added : ' in the longer term , thinking about 20 , 30 years hence , we are talking about a different kind of society , a society in which the world is more equal , where it is more balanced			2
