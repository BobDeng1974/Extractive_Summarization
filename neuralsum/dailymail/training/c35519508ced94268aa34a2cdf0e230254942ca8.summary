he has been fighting before top judges over his multi-million pound divorce from his ex-wife @entity6 a multi-millionaire estate agent whose ' disastrous ' divorce left him unable to afford to buy a home of his own has won a ruling that parts of a family court judgement made last year were ' too favourable ' to his ex wife			1
@entity1 , 59 , argued that a £ 1.45million payout was handed to his ex-wife @entity6 by an ' unfair ' and ' biased ' divorce judge and that he had to put their £ 1.8million six - bedroom former home on the market and move into a rented one - bedroom flat			1
the estate agent , who made his fortune from a lettings agency in @entity24 , ironically complained to the @entity2 that being forced to move into rented accommodation had left him ' nowhere near as comfortable as i have been accustomed to			1
' he argued that the award to his ex-wife effectively saw her handed double the share of the marital assets that he received			1
top judges at the @entity2 ruled that parts of the family court order made last december by mrs justice @entity36 were ' plainly too favourable ' to his ex-wife			1
the court heard how the husband and wife had lived all their married lives in north @entity3 , having been wed for more than 34 years , and had three grown up children when mrs @entity43 began divorce proceedings in 2007			2
as well as the estate agency , @entity47 , and the £ 1.8million former matrimonial home in @entity49 , north @entity3 , the couple had valuable business and property interests in @entity52 and @entity53			0
mr @entity1 , who mrs justice @entity36 said had a 31 - year - old @entity57 girlfriend , told the @entity58 last year that he was ' shocked ' when his wife , aged 59 , told him she was ending their marriage			1
she levelled accusations that her husband had been ' having relations with a call girl called @entity66 ' and ' wasted money by gambling in casinos ' , to the tune of £ 800,000			0
mr @entity1 countered by alleging that his wife had had an affair			1
mrs @entity71 declined to investigate those disputed allegations , but said that mr @entity1 had admitted spending £ 800,000 in casinos over the years			2
despite being given £ 1million worth of assets by the divorce judge , mr @entity1 told the @entity2 that sum was effectively reduced to £ 648,000 - less than half what his wife received - when his debts and liabilities were taken into account			1
he added that most of that sum is tied up in his businesses and , as a result , the former multi-millionaire is now living on just £ 11,000 - a - year			0
mr @entity1 bemoaned his ' desperate financial position ' , saying a delay of 12 months between the divorce hearing and the judge ’s decision meant that ' the judgment no longer reflected a fair division of the family fortune			1
' he said : ' the judge has awarded twice as much to my former wife which is grossly unfair			0
' most of what the judge has left me is tied up in business , therefore i will never be in a position to buy a home for myself and will be forced to rent accommodation which will be nowhere near as comfortable as what i have been accustomed to			2
' @entity43 outside @entity3 's @entity2 ' i do n’t want to be left without any money and have to stay in the one - bedroom rented flat i ’m in at the moment indefinitely			2
' he added : ' my family made huge contribution to the matrimonial property			0
no reasonable judge who had read and understood the facts of the case could have reached the decisions she has reached			0
her decision is perverse and completely biased against me			0
' mr @entity1 was accused in the family court by his former wife of concealing assets worth £ 22million			1
while mrs justice @entity117 found that there was no evidence that he had ' a £ 20million lifestyle ' , she did find that he had ' given a deliberately inaccurate or concocted account ' to the court and ' not made full disclosure ' in relation to his finances			0
but at the @entity2 , mr @entity1 said that he had no reason to conceal that money from his former wife as he thought they were ' a happily married couple until she shocked me with news that she wanted a divorce			2
' mr @entity1 said that he had been a good husband and father for more than 30 years and was not a ' gangster			2
' he claimed that , because of the delay between hearing and judgement - due to the judge being taken seriously ill - she had ' forgotten the evidence and did n’t get to grips with the case			0
' @entity145 , for mrs @entity43 - whose lifestyle @entity117 found involved ' extravagant personal spending ' - said that the judge had not made her decision on the division of wealth out of ' bias ' but on the evidence and had not strayed outside her judicial discretion			0
lord @entity154 concluded that the way the judge ’s decision was framed had unfairly left mr @entity1 solely liable for £ 330,000 worth of debt on the couple ’s property in @entity53			1
the judge also criticised a clause giving the wife control over when mr @entity1 will receive his share of the marital assets , putting him in a position where he could potentially have to wait indefinitely			1
allowing the appeal and altering mrs justice @entity36 's ruling , the judge said : ' the wife has been put in a better position than she would have been			2
' the ruling means in effect that the husband ’s share of the marital assets has been increased by £ 165,000 and the period of time he must wait before receiving his portion has been taken out of his wife ’s hands			1
judges at @entity3 's @entity2 , pictured , ruled that justice @entity36 's original divorce ruling was ' unsupportable and not fair ' lord @entity187 , delivering the court ’s main judgement , said : ' the history is unfortunate			1
the husband has described these proceedings as a disaster and i have some sympathy with that view			0
' the trial took place in december 2010 , but the judge did not deliver her judgement until december 2011			0
that is highly unusual in an ancillary relief trial			0
' mr @entity1 has asserted that the 12 months between trial and judgement led to a number of errors and erroneous conclusions by the judge			2
' i ’m not persuaded that the fundamental division order made by the judge resulted from any misdirection or error or otherwise exceeded the generous ambit of her discretion			0
mr @entity1 said that the divorce settlement had meant that he had to put the couple 's home on this leafy @entity49 avenue on the market and rent a one - bedroom flat ' however she wrongly , in my opinion , rejected submissions to limit the period in which the husband might be kept out of his allotted share of the assets			1
' the order that the husband bear the £ 330,000 debt had resuted in ' a windfall ' for the wife and the judge said that clause was ' completely unsupportable and not fair			2
' lord justice @entity187 said : ' we are not happy that she came to the right decision on these points			0
we allow the appeal to the extent of redrafting aspects of the order which are plainly too favourable to the wife			0
' ' the husband has succeeded in reducing the shadow of this order on his future			0

@entity1 , 59 , said that ruling had left him nowhere near ' as comfortable ' as he is used to
he argued that his ex-wife @entity6 effectively got double the share of the marital assets
@entity252 ruled that the original settlement was ' not fair '
