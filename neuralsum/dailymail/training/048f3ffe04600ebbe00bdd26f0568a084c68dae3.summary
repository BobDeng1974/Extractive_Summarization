victims of alleged historical child abuse have told @entity2 may they are withdrawing support from the government ’s paedophile inquiry			1
a total of 23 individuals sent the home secretary a letter claiming the inquiry was ‘ not fit for purpose ’			2
it came ahead of a crunch meeting today between mrs may and some of the largest groups for child sex abuse victims which could lead to the inquiry being undermined			1
victims of alleged historical child abuse have told @entity17 ( pictured ) they are withdrawing support from the government ’s paedophile inquiry @entity20 , chief executive of the @entity21 for people abused in @entity23 , said his organisation had not signed the letter – but insisted it echoed the views of the other abuse survivors			1
he said mrs may must pledge to give the beleaguered inquiry extra powers , including granting it statutory powers to compel witnesses to give evidence and to properly consult victims ’ groups			1
‘ at the end of the meeting , if we feel the home secretary is not serious about getting the inquiry right , then we will probably walk away , but until then it is too early to say			2
i believe she is committed to it ; now she must show that commitment			0
’ @entity43 ( pictured ) and @entity44 have quit the role amid concerns about their links to figures alleged to be involved in the alleged cover - up ‘ i am not hopeful that we will get what we want			0
’ the letter to mrs may said the 23 signatories would not take up an offer to attend the meeting			1
it said : ‘ we , alongside many survivors , have made numerous representations to you regarding our view that the @entity60 as it stands is not fit for purpose			0
‘ the @entity65 seems to be running the inquiry to meet others ’ needs rather than those of survivors and the public			1
’ we therefore have little option but to end engagement with the @entity60 and call on other survivors , whistleblowers , associated professionals and agencies to follow suit			2
’ mrs may set up a government inquiry into historical child abuse in the summer amid incendiary claims there was an @entity81 cover - up of a murderous paedophile ring around @entity83 in the 1980s			1
but she has struggled to put in place a chairman who retains the confidence of victims ’ groups			2
@entity43 and @entity44 have quit the role amid concerns about their links to figures alleged to be involved in the alleged cover - up			0
mrs may said : ‘ i am aware of the letter , i have been speaking to survivors , various groups of survivors and representatives of those groups and listening to the issues they have raised			1
the issues in the letter have been raised previously and we are looking at them			0
‘ i am very clear that we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to get to the bottom of this issue and what has happened			0
' why is it that over the years - not just in the past but as we have seen in @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 that it is happening today – why is it that institutions , parts of governments , agencies including police and local authorities whose duty it is to protect children have been failing in that duty			0
we need to look into that and learn lessons for the future			0
