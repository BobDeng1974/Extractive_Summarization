taxpayers face a bill for at least £ 100million after the competition to run the flagship @entity4 rail franchise descended into a humiliating farce yesterday			2
in an embarrassing u-turn – announced one minute after midnight – transport secretary @entity7 pulled the plug on the 15 - month bidding process to run trains between @entity11 and @entity12			1
in a highly unusual move , three officials at the @entity14 were suspended as ministers sought to blame civil servants for a series of ‘ unacceptable mistakes ’ in the way the department handled bids by @entity23 , @entity24 and two other companies			1
embarrassing u-turn : ministers have ditched their controversial plans for the @entity4 after sir @entity29 challenged their decision in the @entity31 mr @entity7 said the department was ‘ wholly and squarely ’ to blame for getting its sums wrong			1
bidding on three other rail franchises was also suspended			1
the @entity14 ’s permanent secretary @entity35 said he had suspended three civil servants , two of them senior , connected with the franchise bid			1
@entity38 – which said it would consider renationalising the railways – claimed ministers bore some responsibility for the ‘ debacle ’			0
@entity43 was said to be furious about the handling of the multi-billion - pound franchise bid			1
a source said the revelation that the @entity14 had made serious errors had ‘ gone down like a cup of cold sick ’ in @entity49			1
the affair also threatened to shred the reputation of rising @entity55 star @entity54 who , as @entity7 , had repeatedly brushed aside concerns about the bidding process			1
fiasco : @entity43 is said to be furious about the handling of the bidding process , which was scrapped in an announcement made by transport secretary @entity7 ( right ) at one minute past midnight under fire : the affair also threatens to shred the reputation of rising @entity55 star @entity54 who , as @entity7 , had repeatedly brushed aside concerns about the bidding process and it is a warning shot to @entity66 who , as rail minister , actually signed off the controversial deal			1
she has since been promoted to be @entity69			0
@entity24 boss sir @entity29 , whose court challenge forced the government to examine its decision , welcomed the climbdown			1
sir @entity29 , who branded the @entity14 ’s initial decision as ‘ insane ’ , told the @entity76 that his firm , which has run the franchise for 14 years , faced ‘ institutional bias ’ from @entity14 officials			1
comic relief : @entity82 's take on the rail franchise debacle ‘ @entity23 were given information @entity24 was not given			2
and some of the information was not given to everyone equally , ’ he said			0
‘ but to the credit of the new minister , he said they were 100 per cent guilty and were dealing with it			0
’ sir @entity29 said it was ‘ highly likely ’ he would continue to run the route for the next two years and would donate all profits to ‘ good causes ’ including developing greener fuels			2
@entity24 complained that @entity23 , which offered £ 2billion more , had overbid for the lucrative franchise and would be unable to deliver – a claim flatly denied by @entity23			0
former cabinet secretary @entity99 , who retired last december , admitted the @entity4 fiasco ' does raise some issues about skills in the civil service '			1
he said civil servants who made mistakes should be held accountable , adding : ' there are civil servants up and down the country doing great jobs , but we are suffering some areas where there are skills shortages , in the commissioning area , in the procurement area			1
' he added that this results in ' occasional mistakes '			0
lord @entity99 claimed @entity118 must pay higher salaries if it wanted the best staff , telling today : ' that 's part of the answer and we should be prepared to do that			1
' having an arbitrary constraint like the prime minister 's salary is n't helpful			0
' hel added : ' it 's not that they 're greedy , but pay is a measure of how much they feel they 're valued			0
' he also criticised ministers who attacked civil servants , saying it was ' a mistake ' and ' self - defeating '			2
yesterday mr @entity7 acknowledged his department had fatally miscalculated the risk attached to the rival projects			0
mr @entity7 said the decision to cancel the bidding process would cost £ 40million , but most observers expect the final bill to rise to well over £ 100million because of potential compensation claims from @entity23 and the costs associated with a complete overhaul of the franchise system			2
@entity150 , a @entity38 member of the @entity152 transport committee , said : ‘ they are talking about £ 40million but it will be several times that in the end by the time all the legal issues are settled – it is an utter shambles			0
’ @entity23 , which had initially been told it had won the contract , saw £ 240million wiped off the value of its shares as they plunged by 21 per cent on the news			0
the firm was last night said to be considering legal action			0
all change : the competition to run the @entity4 , which runs from @entity11 to @entity170 , has been cancelled mr @entity7 said he was ‘ very angry ’ about what had happened , insisting : ‘ i want to make it absolutely clear that neither @entity23 nor @entity24 did anything wrong			0
' the fault of this lies wholly and squarely with the @entity14			2
both of those two companies acted properly on the advice that they were getting from the @entity14			0
’ mr @entity7 said the mistakes had been uncovered as the @entity14 prepared for the @entity24 legal challenge			2
@entity23 was supposed to take over the line on december 9			0
labour leader @entity181 branded the bidding process ‘ a disgrace ’			1
he said the prime minister – who was urged by sir @entity29 to take personal charge of the affair – bore responsibility for the disastrous outcome			1
he also indicated he was willing to reconsider the ownership of the rail network			0
asked what form rail ownership might take under a future @entity38 government , he told the @entity194 : ‘ it could be public , it could be private , it could be not for profit franchises			1
here are the key dates in the @entity4 franchise saga : 1997 : @entity198 , a joint venture between sir @entity29 's @entity200 and @entity201 , begins running the @entity4 after being awarded a 15 - year contract following the privatisation of @entity205 railways			1

august 26 , 2012 : sir @entity29 offers to run the line " for free " to give @entity229 time to conduct a review into the procurement process			2
he said @entity200 and @entity201 would run the service on a not - for - profit basis after december if mps needed more time to look at the matter			0
august 27 , 2012 : @entity38 urges the government to delay signing the contract with @entity23 until @entity229 reconvenes so the matter can be debated in the @entity152			0
the @entity14 says there is " no reason " to delay the signing			0
august 28 , 2012 : @entity24 starts @entity31 proceedings demanding a judicial review into the decision to hand the contract to @entity23			0
