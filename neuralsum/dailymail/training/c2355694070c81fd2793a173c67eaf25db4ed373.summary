@entity1 , 45 , could face up to seven years in prison when he is sentenced on february 26 after being convicted of failing to pay nearly £ 628,000 in @entity11 over a 12 - year period			1
he had been working as a @entity13 , a member of the legal profession ’s elite , at @entity17 ’s 39 @entity16 , enjoying a gold - plated pay package			0
it is headed by @entity20 , @entity13 , the senior counsel to the @entity21 on the culture , practices and ethics of the @entity25			0
@entity1 , whose income rose from £ 85,000 in 2001 to £ 346,000 by 2008 , was charging vat on his fees but failed to pass a penny on to @entity29 between june 1999 and september 2011			1
the money helped to buy a £ 1.1million home in @entity32 , @entity33 , and a £ 490,000 home in @entity35			0
@entity1 , whose online cv depicts a lawyer with a particular expertise in fraud cases , insisted he was simply ‘ extremely poor at paperwork ’			1
his conviction at @entity2 comes weeks after the @entity42 promised a crackdown on middle - class professionals , such as lawyers , who do n’t pay their taxes			0
yesterday a statement from 39 @entity48 said : ‘ it is and always has been clear that all members of these @entity51 , in common with all other self - employed barristers , are personally responsible to account to , and pay , @entity29 for @entity11 received , and for income tax			1
’ prosecutor @entity54 told the court : ' through all of that time , he was collecting the vat			0
' it ’s just that for that period of 12 years , whilst it was being collected in , it was n’t being accounted for or handed over as vat			1
' it provided him , if you think about it , with a private , tax - free income because @entity11 was not being paid			2
this money , it stayed with mr @entity1			2
' convicted : @entity1 , a barrister , stopped paying his own vat in 1999 - shortly before he moved to the @entity68 chambers - and then fell off the tax register , meaning he ' disappeared off the vat radar ' hearing : @entity1 was today found guilty of cheating the public revenue at @entity17 's @entity2 after the jury was asked to give a majority verdict following more than nine hours of deliberations ' this is a man that is used to looking at other people ’s business and dissecting it and finding fault in it , ' he told jurors			1
