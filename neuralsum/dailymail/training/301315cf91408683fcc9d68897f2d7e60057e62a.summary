the suicide rate is skyrocketing in @entity1 as the economic catastrophe engulfing the nation shows no signs of letting up			1
a sun - kissed land with once the lowest recorded suicide rates in @entity8 , @entity1 has seen a huge spike in people taking their own lives			1
experts believe that not all suicides are the result of depression ; some are ending it all in an act of ultimate political protest			0
@entity1 used to have the lowest recorded suicide rates in @entity8			1
recently , there has been a spike in people taking their own lives , however more than 2,500 people have taken their own lives since 2010			1
' this is the number for confirmed suicides			0
we think the real number is much higher , ' said psychiatrist @entity28			0
he mans a psyhiatric hotline that rings off the hook every day			0
@entity1 , which is headed for an autumn bankruptcy unless it does more to reign in spending and release fresh @entity34 funds worth 40 billion euros , saw 50 deaths and a further 350 suicide attempts in the capital athens in june alone			1
deaths are rising across the country and on the numerous islands that surround @entity1			2
@entity1 prime minister @entity41 will next week hold his first meetings with euro zone leaders since taking office , striving to assure them he will honour a pledge for more austerity and gauging whether they could grant him more time to pull it off			1
mr @entity41 will insist he can ram through an austerity package worth about 11.5 billion euros ( $ 14.2 billion ) - a key condition to continue receiving @entity53 / @entity34 bailout funds and avoid default and a possible exit from the currency club			1
@entity1 has yet to nail down the requested austerity package			2
the bulk of the cuts will come from state salaries and pensions , and up to 40,000 public sector firings , further angering an austerity - weary public that often takes to the streets			0
the coalition 's two leftist junior partners have also opposed any further cuts			0
mr @entity41 said : ' we 're all having a difficult time			1
there will be more hardship '			2
the @entity1 people have been hit hard by austerity cuts which have led some to take their lives the first four months of this year saw a surge in the number of suicides among the poor and those older than 65			1
it has risen by more than 33 percent against the same period for 2011 - 700 people taking their lives since january 1			1
before the financial crisis began , @entity1 had the lowest suicide rate in @entity8 at 2.8 per 100,000 inhabitants , according to @entity86			2
' most of the suicides were among members of the middle class and , in many cases , the act itself was carried out in public , almost as if it were a theatrical performance , ' commented @entity96 's @entity95 magazine this week			2
rising in tandem is the usage of anti-depressant drugs ; up 25 percent on last year in @entity100 , 18 percent across the country as a whole			1
deaths like that of a 77 - year - old pharmacist who shot himself to death on @entity107 in downtown @entity100 in april , and @entity108 , who blew his brains out at the same place in the same month , have captured headlines and stoked fears among experts that worse is to come			0
people have hanged themselves in public , set alight to themselves in public and died in numerous other ways in the privacy of their own homes			0
a note written in red letters on a piece of cardboard are pinned on a memorial to @entity108 in @entity100			0
they read : ' the government has annihilated all traces for my survival , which was based on a very dignified pension that i alone paid into for 35 years with no help from the state			0
' i see no other solution than this dignified end to my life so that i do n't find myself fishing through garbage cans for my sustenance			0
' i believe that young people with no future will one day take up arms and hang the traitors of this country on @entity107			0
' the newspaper @entity142 describes the mood among @entity1 as a ' society on the verge of a nervous breakdown			1
' many @entity1 took to the streets to protest against the cuts that have seen many fall into financial hardship in a bid to offer suffering @entity1 some hope , mr @entity41 will use his talks next week to raise a long - standing proposal that the measures be spread over four instead of two years , to soften their impact on a @entity1 economy enduring its longest and deepest recession since @entity159			1
no formal request will be made but the proposal will be broached as part of exploratory talks , an official said			0
' the matter of extension is already being debated in @entity1 and abroad			2
its official submission is a different matter '			0
@entity169 insists that @entity100 honour its pledges but was open to discussion , mr @entity168 said			0
asked about @entity1 seeking a two - year austerity extension , he said : ' the chancellor will of course first listen to what mr @entity41 has to say about the situation in @entity1 and about the implementation of its programme			1
' for her , as for the rest of the @entity96 government , the agreed memorandum of understanding which sets out what the @entity1 must achieve and which remains valid for us , forms the basis for working together with or helping @entity1			2
' a two - year extension to narrow the budget deficit below 3 per cent of @entity189 in 2016 instead of 2014 was a key plank of @entity41 's campaign for the june 17 election that brought him to power as head of a fragile three - party coalition			2
but @entity41 and his finance minister , @entity196 , put the demand on the back burner after meeting @entity53 / @entity34 inspectors in @entity100 last month , realising that no concessions would be considered until the lenders were convinced of their commitment to austerity - a big task given repeatedly missed targets and broken promises over the past two years			1
they must deliver the 11.5 billion euros before the inspectors return in early september to decide whether to release the next loan tranche and draft a key report that will determine whether the country will be supported or abandoned .			0
