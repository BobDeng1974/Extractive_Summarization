in memory : a statue of @entity2 has been placed in @entity5 following her execution a woman who was burned at the stake for sorcery more than 300 years is the subject of an extraordinary retrial which is seeking to clear her name			1
@entity2 was tried , convicted and burned at the stake in the @entity14 city of @entity5 in 1627 for being a witch - one of an estimated 25,000 alleged sorcerers incinerated for practicing the dark arts in @entity18 in days gone by			1
however , her supporters are hoping to see her name cleared of any wrongdoing in a trial which could pave the way for other similar hearings to take place			2
mrs @entity2 ran the local post office and attended parties in the city			1
her modern - day defenders say she was tortured and burned because a political rival wanted to get his hands on her money			1
her story is well - known in @entity18 - there is a statue of her in the town hall in @entity5 and a book was written about her			1
now @entity5 council - the same body which found her guilty - is reopening her case			1
@entity41 , an evangelical priest and religious education teacher who made the request for the trial to be reheard , said : ' @entity2 held her own reputation in high esteem , she would want to have it cleared			2
' as @entity49 , we find it challenging when innocent people are executed , even if it was centuries ago			2
' @entity41 tracked down some of her living relatives , some of whom will attend the hearings			0
evidence from the time will be re-examined and a panel of local politicians , clergy and lay people will decide on her guilt or innocence			0
one of her relatives , @entity67 , said : ' i do think she should have her name cleared			0
but i think of the endless amount of people still living who are being mistreated and find that much worse			0
' if the case is successful it could lead to similar hearings across @entity18 , the @entity76 country which burned more witches than any other			0
following the @entity82 , which lasted from 1626 to 1631 , 157 men , women and children in the city were burned alive at the stake and more than 900 burnt altogether over the entire area			0
they were judged for sorcery and witchcraft and for having made a pact with the @entity88 , and were a part of the witch hysteria that precipitated a series of witch trials in @entity18 at that time , such as at @entity93 where over 300 executions took place , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98			2
witch hunt : men , women and children were burned alive at the stake for using sorcery during the witch trials of the 1600s retrial : @entity5 ( pictured ) - the same city where @entity2 was executed - is the scene of a retrial into her sorcery crimes the @entity109 was the driving force behind the persecution which was enthusiastically stoked up by nobles across the @entity113 , prince bishop of @entity114 , and his nephew @entity115 , were responsible for burning 900 people , including 19 catholic priests and children of seven who were said to have had intercourse with demons			1
people from all walks of life were arrested and charged , regardless of age , profession or sex , for reasons ranging from murder and @entity131 to ' humming a song with the @entity88 , ' or simply for being vagrants and unable to give a satisfactory explanation of why they were passing through town			0
witch trials : the town of @entity114 @entity2 was said to have been an influential citizen of @entity5			1
she and her brother @entity140 inherited a post office from their father and were thought to have been embroiled in a dispute at the @entity144 about the creation of a central post office			1
she was accused of sorcery amid a great witch trial in @entity5 between 1626 and 1631			1
both she and her brother were arrested by the commission of the archbishop in january 1627 and were accused of using magic to cause several cases of death and sickness			0
she was imprisoned but - despite suffering terrible sickness and injuries from torture - never admitted to anything			2
in spite of this , she was found guilty of witchcraft and sentenced to be burned at the stake for sorcery			0
her brother tried many times to get her freed , but he was unsuccessful and he also tried to get her name cleared after her execution			0
it was not until after her death that research revealed she could have been the victim of a conspiracy			0
in 1629 , @entity140 was himself accused of witchcraft and was arrested in 1631 , along with a number of other influential @entity5 citizens			2
however , his witch trial was interrupted soon after by intervention			0
