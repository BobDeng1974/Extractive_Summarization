by @entity0 published : 09:55 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 06:15 est , 18 september 2013 @entity1 is in the throes of a ' grandma export ' as one in five @entity1 say they are considering sending their elderly relatives to a care home abroad			1
a survey released by @entity1 pollster @entity8 shows the so - called ' @entity10 ' is becoming a trend as the cost of residential care rockets out of the remits of the state insurance			2
@entity1 citizens enjoy long - term care insurance that pays out € 1,550 ( around £ 1,300 ) a month , but this covers less than half of the € 3,250 ( £ 2,730 ) average monthly cost for care inside @entity1			1
cost of care : the average @entity1 care home costs around ¿ 3,250 ( £ 2,730 ) per month , compared with ¿ 1,200 ( approximately £ 1,000 ) for the same or better care in @entity25 the @entity26 predicts prices will rise , as the cost of long - term care of the elderly is expected to go up from 1.4 per cent of gdp last year to 3.3 per cent by 2060			1
by contrast , the average cost of care in a @entity25 home is just € 1,200 ( just over £ 1,000 )			1
aging : more than 15 per cent of @entity1 's population is expected to be over the age of 60 by 2050 the @entity1 government will pay as much as € 700 ( £ 590 ) towards nursing care outside the country - enough together with most elderly people 's pensions to cover @entity25 costs , often with money left over			1
in december last year , the @entity1 socio - political advisory group @entity45 ( @entity46 ) said an ' alarm signal ' should be sounded about the number of elderly @entity1 leaving the country			0
researchers said there were 7,146 pensioners living in @entity53 retirement homes in 2011 , more than 3,000 in the @entity54 and more than 600 in @entity55			0
many are concerned about the trend , with journalist @entity58 writing in the newspaper @entity59 of a ' gerontological colonialism ' and commenting ' rubbish is exported ... wherever it is cheapest to dispose of them ... and now we 're exporting our infirm and elderly '			0
but the new figures also highlight how many @entity1 have been disappointed by the standard of care in their own country and say @entity25 nursing homes are not only cheaper , but also better			1
@entity70 , 66 , said she chose a @entity25 nursing home for her 94 - year - old mother after struggling to care for her in her own town of @entity74 in southern @entity1			1
her mother had to move from her own apartment to an assisted - living arrangement , which then closed			0
she then went to a nursing home where mrs @entity79 slaims her mother lost weight and was given sedatives			0
the € 1,200 - a - month @entity25 nursing home she chose offers 24 - hour care , a double room , full board , medical care and a range of therapy programmes			1
speaking to @entity91 news , mrs @entity79 said : ' i can only say , children , when your parents get older , send them to @entity25			0
' ' i can only say , children , when your parents get older , send them to @entity25 ' @entity70 , 66 , daughter of @entity25 care home resident many top - class @entity25 facilities now advertise on @entity1 - language websites and cater specifically to @entity1 clients			2
one home in the @entity25 town of @entity104 in @entity105 has @entity1 - speaking nurses , lift announcements and emergency call systems in @entity1 and shows @entity1 @entity110 football on fancy flat - screen tvs			2
the kitchen is made by @entity113 and serves classic @entity1 meals such as suppers of bread , meat and cheese , and even the teaspoons are made in @entity1 - as is all the linen and the plastic hygienic gloves worn by staff			0
since it opened at @entity124 , it has filled all its 34 places and six more single rooms are already reserved for when they open in november			0
however , some have expressed concerns that the distance and the language barrier could lead to people being taken in by false adverts and scams			0
higher standards : germans say @entity25 care homes can offer more for their relatives , even if they are far from home one place called @entity141 in @entity142 near the @entity1 border , which offered delights such as mushroom hunting excursions for its residents as well as an on - site nurse and ultra-cheap rooms at € 400 ( £ 340 ) a month , was exposed in april to be entirely non-functioning			1
a report by the @entity151 suggests around 15 per cent of @entity1 will be over the age of 80 by 2050			2
this will mean the country has the oldest population in the world , along with @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159			2
the @entity160 expects the global population of people over 60 to more than triple to almost 2billion by 2050 .			0

' @entity166 export ' now *recognised* *phenomenon* in @entity1
*eastern* @entity170 care homes charge average € 2,000 ( £ 1,680 ) less per month
@entity1 expected to have oldest population in world by 2050
many @entity1 say @entity25 standard of care better on average
