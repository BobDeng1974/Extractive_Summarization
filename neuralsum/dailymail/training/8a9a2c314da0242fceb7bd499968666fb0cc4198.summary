when @entity1 signed for @entity2 in 2007 , the whole team was invited to a welcome party thrown by @entity4 and @entity5			1
stars grow on trees in @entity8 and we were suddenly mingling with people like @entity11 at this glitzy event held for the @entity1			0
at the time @entity2 was n’t ready for a star like him to play for the club , but a lot has changed over the past few years			1
it is a big , bold statement by @entity32 and particularly a team with @entity2 ’s ambitions			1
since @entity17 made the decision to move to @entity8 he has had a number of telephone conversations with the president @entity39 and the coach @entity40			1
from what i hear they were very impressed by him			0
@entity17 is a leader , an iconic figure and to acquire a player of this quality and pedigree at this stage of his career is a pretty big deal for @entity2			1
@entity17 has signed an initial 18 - month contract with @entity2 , but @entity22 would like to see him stay even longer @entity17 has set his sights on more silverware after sealing a move to @entity2 his initial contract is for 18 months , but i would love to see him stay out here a bit longer because then he could play in the derby against the new franchise @entity60			1
the @entity62 derby against @entity63 is an iconic fixture that @entity17 has starred in over the years , and it would be something special to see him play for @entity2 against a rival team from the same city when they are up and running in 2017			1
in a few months ’ time there is also a big lifestyle change coming for him and all the boys in the locker room will be lobbying him to live in their part of the city			0
i think @entity77 lives in downtown @entity8 , you have the guys who live in @entity79 , @entity80 and those who choose to live by the ocean			0
i was talking to @entity1 the other day and we had a laugh because he said maybe @entity17 should just rent out his house ! @entity17 will be hooking up again with former @entity86 team - mate @entity77 @entity77 has been a big hit since his move to @entity2 in 2011 he can live wherever he wants untroubled and stress free , taking his kids down to the ocean in the afternoons or to the park			1
i do n’t think he will get the same attention with the paparazzi as @entity1			0
in many ways i felt for @entity1 because i really liked him and i saw a guy who just wanted to be normal and to play his football			0
he was humble and remains a good friend			0
there is a huge difference in the salaries of the players , but the @entity2 players will respect @entity17 for his achievements in the game and his status , they will play practical jokes just like any other			1
@entity1 was a sensation during his time in the @entity32 @entity77 jokes with @entity1 in training back in 2011 at @entity2 , when @entity1 and i were trying to get to the medical room first he taped up my locker while i was having treatment because i had got there first			1
i retaliated by putting super glue on the soles of his flip flops so that when he put his feet into them he would not be able to move			2
the poor guy nearly fell on the floor when he tried to walk			0
that is normal , usual stuff in any locker room and @entity17 will be made to feel part of it			1
he will make friends for life there			0
yes the guy next to him could be earning $ 30,000 a year and he will be earning maybe $ 5m , but that same player will still invite him round to a bbq with the rest of the players later that day			0
when @entity1 was with us he told me that at one of his clubs he did n't get invited to a team - mate ’s house once			0
@entity2 is a different way of life and everybody mixes socially			2
@entity2 sold plenty of ' @entity1 ' shirts during his time at the club the temperature is around 70 - 75 every day as well and he will be able to walk down the street in relative anonymity			1
people travel from all over to be in our backyard and @entity17 is going to live in one of the greatest cities in the world			2
the standard of @entity32 is better than the @entity157 like to portray it , too			2
@entity17 will help raise the profile of it			2
there will be adaptations , such as the long distance travelling for games			0
that really did shock @entity1 and @entity167 , the former @entity63 defender , when they signed for @entity2			2
@entity22 insists @entity17 will love his time in @entity8 some of the pitches are artificial too and @entity17 will have to get used to playing on them			1
i do n’t think @entity1 liked them			0
the @entity2 fans will love his commitment , passion and desire			2
it was very noticeable that he has spoken of winning trophies and that is good because @entity2 have won three titles in the last four years			2
they get around 28,000 at the @entity25 and they are a passionate group of fans			0
at this stage of his career it is the perfect fit			0
@entity22 is a @entity186 analyst for @entity187 and is a former @entity2 and @entity189 national team player .			1
