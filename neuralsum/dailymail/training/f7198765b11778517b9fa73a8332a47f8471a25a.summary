a judge struck down part of @entity3 's gay marriage ban for the first time on friday by ordering the state to recognize same - sex marriages legally performed in other states , saying state laws banning the unions single out gay couples ' for no logical reason			1
' the order means such couples will be eligible to sign up for a wide range of tax , health insurance , veterans and other benefits now afforded to opposite - sex married couples			2
@entity3 attorney general @entity21 , who has defended the state 's ban on gay marriage , said his office was reviewing the ruling			1
victory : same - sex couple @entity28 , second from right , and @entity30 , right , of @entity31 , give interviews at the @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity3 the decision comes in a lawsuit filed by 10 same - sex couples who legally married outside the state , including @entity30 and @entity28			1
the @entity31 couple , who married in @entity40 , said friday 's ruling could boost their household income , and they plan to apply monday for @entity45 to receive @entity47 benefits as @entity28 's spouse			1
' to me , it 's a real validation by the judge of our relationship and our commitment to each other , ' @entity28 said			0
the @entity56 , which is helping the couples , noted the ruling was a first in the state			0
' we 're gratified that the court recognized that married same - sex couples and their families are no different than other couples , and that the @entity66 requires them to be treated equally , ' @entity56 attorney @entity60 said			0
' this is not the first court to reach this conclusion , but it is the first court to do so in @entity3 , so it 's a tremendous day for our state			2
' @entity33 circuit judge @entity72 sided with the couples , who argue that their rights to equal protection and due process are being violated by @entity3 's ban on gay marriage			1
@entity72 said the couples deserve the same recognition as opposite - sex couples who married in other states			0
' the undisputed facts before the @entity85 show that , to the extent these laws prohibit plaintiffs ' legally contracted marriages from other states being recognized here , they are wholly irrational , do not rest upon any reasonable basis , and are purely arbitrary , ' @entity72 wrote			0
' all they do is treat one segment of the population - gay men and lesbians - differently than their same - sex counterparts , for no logical reason			0
' landmark : the ruling entitles same - sex couples who married elsewhere to apply for various state benefits and entitlements - though it did not address the state 's current ban on same - sex marriage ceremonies the lawsuit before @entity72 only challenges @entity3 's refusal to recognize marriages legally performed outside the state , not laws that bar same - sex couples from getting married in @entity3			1
@entity60 said the ruling means that thousands of @entity3 couples can now qualify for spousal government benefits and , on a smaller level , change their last names to match their spouse 's on their @entity3 driver 's license			1
the case is among at least three challenging @entity3 's ban : there is a federal challenge in @entity34 , and a @entity31 case focuses on city officials who issued marriage licenses to four same - sex couples to trigger a legal test of the ban			1
the lawsuits are based on the same arguments that led the @entity132 @entity85 last year to overturn part of the federal @entity134 that denied a tax , health and other benefits to legally married gay couples			2
in @entity3 , @entity72 said he expects the state @entity85 to ' provide the last word on all of the important legal issues presented by this case			2
' same - sex marriage is now legal in 19 states and the @entity144			0
the @entity56 has cases pending against 13 other states with such bans , including five cases currently before federal appeals courts			0
