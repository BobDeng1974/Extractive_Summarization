the nation 's knees are crumbling under the strain of the obesity crisis , @entity0 can reveal			2
almost 9,500 people classed as obese , including two teenagers , underwent knee replacement surgery last year , at a cost of more than £ 50million			1
the numbers have surged by 150 per cent in just four years , and raise fresh concerns about the extraordinary cost to the @entity12 of dealing with expanding waistlines			1
obesity costs the @entity12 £ 5.1 billion each year with 40,000 people dying as a result of being overweight or obese			1
now it can be revealed that one in 10 patients given new knees is obese , up from one in 20 just four years ago			1
in 2009 - 10 , there were 3,787 operations carried out in @entity34 and @entity35 where obesity was listed as a main or secondary diagnosis			1
but by 2012 - 13 , the number had leapt to 9,438 , figures compiled for @entity0 by the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) reveal			2
over the last four years there have been a total of 28,000 knee replacements operations carried out on people who were obese			1
it includes one boy aged between 10 and 14 who went under the knife in 2010 - 11			1
also in the last four years , knee replacements have been carried out on two boys and two girls aged 15 - 19			1
@entity52 mp @entity51 , chairman of the health select committee , said : ‘ obesity is n’t a disability , it causes disability			0
because of the rise in obesity we are going to see a rise in avoidable disability			0
‘ the thing we should be worrying about is we are not tackling it at an early enough stage			0
‘ we should be focussing our effort on stopping people getting there in the first place			0
' this is just the opening salvo of something that is going to get worse over the coming decades			0
’ data compiled for @entity0 shows how the number of knee operations for obese patients has soared from 3,787 in 2009 - 10 to 9,438 in 2012 - 13 the bulk of knee operations are carried out on people aged 60 + , but in the last four years there has been a three-fold increase in knee replacements among obese under - 40s @entity52 mp @entity51 , chairman of the health select committee , warned the problem would only get worse unless urgent action was taken to prevent obesity causing increased disabilities a knee replacement costs around £ 5,500 , meaning the bill for last year alone could have topped £ 52million			1
the @entity12 says a replacement knee will last for around 15 to 20 years if it is ' not put under too much strain ' , raising the prospect of the same people undergoing repeated surgery throughout their lives			1
official guidance suggests that most knee operations are offered for arthritis , with the over- 65s most likely need treatment			2
however , a quarter of those classed as obese who had knee operations were under 60			1
there has been a three-fold increase in knee replacements among the under - 40s			1
in the last year alone nine people in their twenties and 70 thirty - somethings have had knee operations after becoming obese			1
women are almost twice as likely as men to need treatment			0
of the 9,438 operations last year , almost 6,000 were for female patients			0
@entity117 , from the @entity118 , said : ‘ these figures will continue to rise			0
the human body has evolved for perfection and the knees and the legs and arms and all the bones fit together beautifully			2
‘ what we have done over the last 50 years to an incredible degree is upset the balance of evolution			0
' we are now putting our bones under huge extra burdens which the human body was never designed for			2
‘ what ’s disastrous is people do n’t know of the medical problems which are attached to obesity			0
’ a knee replacement is classed as ‘ major surgery ’ by the @entity12 and is only offered after other treatments , such as physiotherapy or steroid injections have failed to help			2
last year one in 10 patients given new knees was obese , up from one in 20 just four years ago the @entity145 warned obesity affects all age groups and ‘ there is no magic bullet to solve the problem ’			1
a spokesman said : ‘ it is going to take continued effort from all of us ; @entity155 , local communities , industry and individuals to reverse this trend			0
‘ our primary responsibility is to help the nation to be healthier			0
this is why we are working with industry , through the @entity162 , to reduce calories in food and drinks to ensure that healthier options are available			0
‘ we also have a voluntary front of pack labelling scheme which will help people keep track of what they 're eating and give them the information to make healthier choices			0
‘ everyone over the age of 40 can have a free @entity12 health check to spot the warning signs of long - term illness - more people are taking them up than ever before			1
' and for the first time we have given local authorities the power and over £ 5 billion in funding to tackle public health issues in their areas			0
’ this month it was announced free weight - loss surgery could be offered to nearly a million diabetes patients			2
the health watchdog @entity191 called for more obese people with the condition to be considered for a gastric band or bypass			2
at a stroke , the ruling doubled to 1.8million the numbers qualifying for taxpayer - funded surgery .			0
