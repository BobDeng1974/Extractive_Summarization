by @entity0 guzzlers prevailed thursday as @entity3 's highest court refused to reinstate @entity3 's ban on the sale of big sodas , ruling that the city 's health department overstepped its bounds when approved the 16 - ounce cap on sugary beverages			1
the court largely ignored the merits of the ban in the 20 - page ruling , but determined the city 's @entity16 engaged in policy - making , and not simply health regulations , when it imposed the restrictions on restaurants , delis , movie theaters , stadiums and street cart vendors			1
‘ @entity27 engaged in law - making beyond its regulatory authority , ’ the opinion reads			2
‘ ... it is clear that the @entity16 wrote the @entity31 without benefit of legislative guidance			0
’ gulp : @entity3 's highest court dismissed @entity3 's appeal to reinstate the @entity37 - era ban on large sugary soft drinks			1
in this march 2013 photo , then - mayor @entity39 gazes at one of the 64 - ounce cups he so vocally despised the city had hoped thursday 's ruling would overturn a lower court 's decision that blocked the restrictions after restaurants , theater owners , beverage companies and small stores sued			1
‘ we are pleased that the lower courts ' decisions were upheld , ’ the @entity52 said in a statement after the decision was handed down			0
the restrictions , if reinstated , ‘ would have created an uneven playing field for thousands of small businesses in the city and limited @entity3 ' freedom of choice			1
’ @entity61 said the administration of current mayor @entity63 continues to look for ways ‘ to limit the pernicious effects of aggressive and predatory marketing of sugary drinks and unhealthy foods			1
’ victory : former partial - term @entity71 governor and failed vp candidate @entity72 famously mocked @entity37 's ban in 2013			1
now she and her supporters have won a victory ‘ today 's ruling does not change the fact that sugary drink consumption is a key driver of the obesity epidemic , and we will continue to look for ways to stem the twin epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes , ’ @entity76 said			2
the case was decided 4 - 2 , with the majority opinion written by judge @entity89 wrote that city health regulators appeared to carefully weigh the economic , social and health implications of the ban — a policy function that @entity89 wrote was not the health board 's to exercise			1
the two dissenting judges wrote that they believe the @entity16 was within its rights to impose the ban , and that the judiciary should n't ‘ step into the middle of a debate over public health policy			2
’ the city has n't said whether it plans to try to appeal			2
but it 's unlikely that an appeal to the @entity105 would be accepted because the case centers on local government authority and legislation , not federal issues			2
mayor @entity39 spoke out on the decision thursday and condemned the judge for making the decision despite ' irrefutable ' evidence that sugary drinks are horrible for consumers ' health			1
' we are extremely disappointed by today ’s court decision that prevents the city from implementing a sugary drink portion cap policy , ' he said , while noting his team is still in the process of examining the court 's decision			1
@entity125 has been under fire for years , with health advocates saying the sugary beverages are unique in their harmfulness because people do n't realize how much high - fructose corn syrup they 're guzzling			0
the bad publicity has helped lead to a steady decline in @entity136 soda sales for nearly a decade			0
but other sugary drinks such as sports drinks and energy drinks have been growing			0
to help curb consumption , lawmakers and health advocates around the country have proposed soda taxes in recent years			0
none have succeeded , however , in part because of heavy campaigning and lobbying from the beverage industry			0
in @entity153 , a measure that would have slapped a warning label on sodas was recently defeated			0
in the meantime , @entity154 and @entity155 have also been rolling out smaller cans and bottles , some as small as 7.5 ounces			0
the idea is that people would be more willing to drink soda if they could control the portion sizes			0
the smaller sizes are also more profitable for companies			0

@entity3 's highest court ruled thursday that @entity37 and his health department overstepped their legal bounds by *instituting* 2012 ban
a state judge *invalidated* the law in march 2013
the city had since appealed with new mayor @entity63 taking up the cause , which he lost for good thursday
