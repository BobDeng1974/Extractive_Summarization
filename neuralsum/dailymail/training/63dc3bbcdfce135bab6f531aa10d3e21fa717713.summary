by @entity0 published : 09:15 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 12:14 est , 21 january 2013 a former @entity1 has earned himself a place in the record books for freediving after reaching a lung - busting depth of 315ft - the same height as @entity7			1
@entity8 , 40 , held his breath for an incredible two minutes and 52 seconds to claim the title for the deepest freedive ever carried out by a @entity12			1
and he went on to plunge to an even deeper depth of 100m in another dive but was disqualified when his nose clip fell off			2
wearing a wetsuit and flippers , he used a rope to guide himself through the water in a straight line			0
he explained that diving to such depths puts so much pressure on the lungs and muscles that competitors are prone to blacking out			2
he said : ' the air in your lungs gets really compressed			0
' at about 40 metres down the lungs are crushed until they are about a quarter of their size and blood then enters them , protects them and stops them from getting smaller			2
' you really are n't worried about having enough oxygen to get back to the surface , its more about not blacking out			1
dangers in the deep : mr @entity8 said diving to such depths puts so much pressure on the lungs and muscles that competitors are prone to blacking out nearly there : mr @entity8 makes his way back to the surface following his enormous dive down into the water ' the more you dive the more you condition yourself to it			1
' the competition was in the @entity24 so it was a long way to go but you are surrounded by world class divers and you get quite a few opportunities to dive			0
' my first dive did n't go very well but i got my head together and after that every dive felt easier			0
' as soon as i broke the record of 91 metres and made it to 92 metres the pressure was off and it was relatively straight - forward from there to get to 96 metres			2
to watch more dive videos click here pressure : mr @entity8 said after 40 metres down , the lungs are crushed until they are about a quarter of their normal size ' it would have been nice to get 100m , which i did do , but my nose clip came off and rules are rules			1
' it was an immense relief to get the @entity20 record			1
you try and tell yourself it does n't matter but i had built it up because this record was the one i wanted			0
' @entity8 , who now runs a diving school in @entity100 with his girlfriend @entity101 , became interested in free diving while working as a scuba diving instructor			2
he used to get into contests with his friends to see who could hold their breath the longest and found he was quite good at it			0
he said : ' i wanted to do more of it and learned to become a freediving instructor			0
i 've been doing if for four - and - a - half - years now			0
' the previous @entity20 free dive record of 91 metres was held by @entity113 , a geography teacher from @entity114 who set it in 2009			1
the world record holder for free immersion diving is @entity118 , from , @entity119 , which stands at 121 metres			0
mr @entity8 dived 315ft - which is the same height as @entity7			1

@entity8 held his breath for two minutes and 52 seconds in @entity20 record
the 40 - year - old was competing in championships in the @entity32
he said main worry is not running out of oxygen but blacking out during dive
