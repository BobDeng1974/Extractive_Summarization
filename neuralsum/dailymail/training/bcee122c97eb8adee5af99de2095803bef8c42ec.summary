by @entity0 @entity1 was the last person anyone suspected of stealing dinner money from a primary school living in a £ 650,000 detached house and married to a successful financial adviser , @entity1 was universally regarded as a pillar of society			1
so when children 's dinner money started going missing at the primary school where she served as a parent - governor , the former @entity9 hostess was the last person anyone suspected			1
@entity15 by speculation as to which member of staff was the thief , the headmistress installed a hidden camera - and to her horror , the much - respected mother - of - three was captured removing a bag of money which never reached the bank			1
it emerged she had even helped herself to £ 170 which the headmistress had put aside for her @entity29 syndicate			2
questioned as to why she should risk throwing her reputation away for such modest sums , she could only tell police she had been using the money ' to go shopping '			0
yesterday the 46 - year - old 's humiliation was complete as she admitted stealing over £ 3,400 from the school where she had helped out three days a week in the office			1
her ' mortified ' husband @entity39 - the £ 100,000 - a - year managing director of a wealth management company - watched as she admitted seven counts of theft			1
@entity1 , whose elder two children are privately educated , became a governor at @entity47 in @entity47 , @entity48 , after her younger child began attending classes , a court heard			1
she later took on a part - time job as an administrative assistant with duties which included being entrusted with cash and cheques sent by fellow parents for school dinners , trips , uniform , social events and out - of - hours clubs			2
once a week she was meant to bank the money , @entity62 was told			0
' one day a brown envelope containing £ 300 for pupils ' school photographs went missing , ' @entity67 , prosecuting , said			1
' that was followed by the disappearance of £ 170 which was headmistress mrs @entity70 's money for the lottery syndicate			0
' the court heard that the school was torn apart , with both staff and pupils under suspicion , so last summer a @entity78 system was secretly installed to catch the thief			1
@entity1 admitted stealing over £ 3,400 from the school where she had helped out three days a week in the office @entity82 's £ 650,000 detached house she shared with her successful financial adviser husband footage showed @entity1 removing a bag of money from a desk , and after checks established the cash had never been banked , police searched her detached home ' @entity92 ' on an exclusive lane in @entity47			1
she then produced school bank account cheques and paying in slips from a desk			0
interviewed by officers , she had used some of the money ' to go shopping and pay for food ' she said she had wanted to stop stealing and pay the money back but had not done so			0
she thought it was school money and she was not robbing an individual			0
in all , the school lost £ 3,434 over an eight - month period			2
in a victim 's statement , headmistress mrs @entity70 said she had trusted @entity82 and had never suspected she would prove to be the thief			0
' i was saddened when i had to install @entity78 , ' she said			0
' this is a primary school and i should be dealing with education and not having an environment where all the staff and pupils were suspects			2
' i had real affection for mrs @entity1 and trusted her			2
i suspected people but not her			0
' there was real angst in the school over this period and pupils were no longer allowed to go in areas or complete tasks they formerly did			0
' @entity127 , defending , said that while @entity1 and her husband were ' comfortably off ' , she had felt ' invisible ' and had low self - esteem .			1

@entity1 , 46 , admitted using the cash to ' go shopping '
she was caught after £ 3,400 went missing over eight months
suspicion fell on staff and pupils , but no - one thought it would be her
@entity1 helped out three days a week and served as a parent - governor
she was universally regarded as a pillar of society - until she was caught
