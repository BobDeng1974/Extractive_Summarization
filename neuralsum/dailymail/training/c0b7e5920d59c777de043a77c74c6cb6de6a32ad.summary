the worlds of golf and motor racing will meet in the @entity3 next week for the season ’s finale of the @entity6 and @entity7 respectively			1
but while one sport frets about how a distorted points distribution in the final grand prix might affect the overall outcome , the other is left to reflect on how the lack of such contrivance means its race is already effectively run			1
@entity16 could claim title without swinging a club after sensational year it ’s an interesting one , is n’t it ? do you go the route of @entity7 and the @entity23 with its @entity24 to ensure it all comes down to the final event ? or the @entity6 route , which risks the final tournament , as it will be this year , becoming a 72 - hole coronation ? certainly you can understand the angst that will be on show amid the racing fraternity in @entity33			1
it does seem wrong that the most important prize in the sport might be decided by a gimmick			1
but the @entity38 ? could n’t we have done with a gimmick to ensure the race to @entity42 is still a race when everyone gets there ? second - placed @entity46 must win last two tournaments to have any chance of claiming bonus at the moment you ’ve got the season concluding with four strong tournaments known as the @entity54			1
to be fair , the points totals for each event have been tweaked to try to ensure a big finish but the fact is nothing that happened in the first two events in @entity61 has made a blind bit of difference			2
@entity16 began with a lead of just over three million points and , despite playing in neither , ends them with an advantage of just under three million			1
what ’s the point of linking four tournaments together if so little change takes place ? where ’s the incentive to make sure everyone turns up when the leader can miss the first three events and still be miles in front going into the last one ? @entity80 ’s dramatic duel in @entity7 with @entity81 will go to the final race this week ’s @entity83 is a good event in its own right but it ought to be a pivotal tournament in terms of building the excitement towards @entity42			1
yet even if second - placed @entity46 were to win it , there would still be no pressure on @entity16 for top spot			1
maybe this is how it should be , given the truly spectacular year the @entity95 has enjoyed			2
but , in that case , why go along with the pretence of a @entity54 ? if you ’re keen for a four - tournament grand finale , surely the format has to reflect the fact ? who ’s got it right between @entity7 and the @entity6 ? right now , it is tempting to think ... neither			2
@entity105 mirrors past mistakes over the past five years , gifted @entity108 @entity107 has rewritten the record books when it comes to being the youngest to reach a landmark			2
among the highlights are : youngest player to win the @entity114 ; youngest to win the silver medal at @entity116 ; youngest to win on the @entity6 ; youngest player to make the halfway cut at the masters , and youngest to win the tour ’s flagship event			2
now , however , comes one he could have done without : youngest player to suffer such a precipitous decline			0
what on earth has happened to him ? 18 months ago he was on the cusp of the world ’s top 20			1
now he ’s outside the top 120 and never came close to making @entity132 ’s @entity131 team			0
@entity107 finished 76th out of 78 in his last outing in @entity134 at the @entity135 following an encouraging 19th place at @entity116 he has played in seven events with four missed halfway cuts and a best finish of tied 47th for the princely earnings , from the middle of july , of £ 23,000			0
in his last outing in @entity134 at the @entity135 he concluded with a final round of 80 to finish 76th in a field of 78			0
‘ after playing in the majors and seeing the length of the courses , @entity105 has been working on his swing to hit the ball further but unfortunately at the moment it has taken its toll on his results , ’ explained his manager , @entity144			0
@entity107 is not one of the power players and probably does need to find some length			0
and at just 21 , he ’s the right age to try			0
but let ’s hope he does not end up as yet another lost soul who is so bewitched by the big hitters that he loses sight of his own strengths			0
quote of the week ‘ @entity163 is in a very strong position now and that is why i have the confidence to move aside			0
’ after 40 years with the @entity6 , chief executive @entity168 announced last week he is standing down			0
the 65 - year - old is certainly quitting at the top , following the most successful playing season in the tour ’s history , with three of the four majors in @entity132 hands plus the @entity131			0
it is also one where the top 25 in the race to @entity42 will all make in excess of £ 1million , and the top 10 more than £ 2m .			1

@entity16 has *commanding* lead in the race to @entity42
the world no 1 could claim the title without swinging a club
@entity46 , @entity186 and @entity187 have outside chance
