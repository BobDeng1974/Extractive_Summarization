by @entity0 published : 19:17 est , 5 september 2012 updated : 10:37 est , 6 september 2012 two astronauts resorted to @entity2 like moves to save the $ 100 billion @entity4 with a $ 3 toothbrush			1
astronauts @entity6 and @entity7 were able to construct a make shift tool , proving that just because they are rocket scientists does n't mean they ca n't be handy			2
their ingenuity allowed for the installation of a much needed part on the space craft , needed to relay power			1
there are four 220 - pound @entity26 on the @entity4 that are able to harness power from the outpost 's solar arrays			1
but with one of the electrical units not operating , there had been limited power use in the space station and astronauts were called on to replace it with a new one			1
@entity6 and @entity7 had been working to install a new @entity22 back on august 30 but encountered difficulty in bolting the new unit down to the spacecraft			2
it appeared that there was significant debris , described as metal shavings , that had amassed inside the bolts and was preventing them from attaching it to the space craft and securing the @entity22			2
@entity7 was able to maneuver a wire cleaner around one of the bolt holders , that loosed a lot of metal shavings but it just was n't enough , he told the @entity58 team back in @entity59			0
their repeated attempts to clean out the bolts drew out their space walk to a daunting 8 hours			0
' over 10 hours in the suit			0
no bathroom and no lunch , ' @entity6 wrote in her blog about the grueling ordeal , about the total time she was suited up for space			0
cleaning house : the astronauts prepared for cleaning the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) on september 5 , with their toothbrush mission possible : @entity6 and @entity75 perform a spacewalk to complete an equipment installation outside the @entity4 with the debris around the bolts , there was little chance of a successful @entity22 installation			1
so the space team , along with their colleagues at @entity58 back on earth put their heads together to figure out a way to fix the problem			0
they decided the outer space team needed to do some deep cleaning and the idea for the toothbrush tool was born - fastening a simple toothbrush to a metal pole			1
on wednesday , @entity6 and @entity7 took to cleaning the bolts			0
after about four hours of intense scrubbing , the bolts were pristine and the pair were able to successfully attached the @entity22			0
' looks like you guys just fixed the station , ' astronaut @entity101 radioed from @entity105 at @entity58 's @entity106 in @entity59 , @entity107			0
the @entity4 is currently home to six astronauts : @entity6 and @entity109 of @entity58 , @entity20 of the @entity110 , and @entity112 cosmonauts @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			1
space walk : @entity58 astronaut @entity6 and @entity117 astronaut @entity75 at the @entity4			2

the @entity4 needed a scrubbing to allow for the installation of a new electrical unit
astronauts were limited in their cleaning *hardware* , until the idea was born for an *ingenious* toothbrush tool
the *effective* scrubber *removed* the collected debris on the spacecraft and allowed the new power unit to attach to the space station
