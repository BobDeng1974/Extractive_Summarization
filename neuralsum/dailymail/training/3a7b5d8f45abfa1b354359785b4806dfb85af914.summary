by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 18:07 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 01:58 est , 19 july 2013 five rail bosses are set to receive £ 11million over three years in an extraordinary deal that critics condemned as rewarding failure			1
the top executives at @entity7 could share bonuses of £ 5million on top of their six - figure salaries , despite years of dismal performance and inflation - busting fare rises			1
the deal was nodded through yesterday			0
the taxpayer - funded firm is currently facing a £ 75million fine for missing its punctuality targets for long distance services			1
@entity7 , a not - for - profit company , has also been dogged by constant complaints over crowded trains and fare rises			1
its five bosses were already earning salaries of between £ 348,000 and £ 577,000 a year , with annual bonuses worth up to 60 per cent of their basic income			1
but yesterday a new ‘ long - term incentive ’ payment was agreed			0
this additional bonus will be paid at the end of three years and is worth a maximum of a full year ’s salary , depending on performance			0
the new element was rubber - stamped at the company ’s annual general meeting in @entity35			0
over three years chief executive @entity36 could earn £ 3.1million , made up of his basic salary of £ 577,000 , a long - term bonus worth the same again and potential annual bonuses worth £ 790,490 over three years			1
the other four directors will earn between £ 1.8million and £ 2.1million over the three - year period if they hit performance targets			1
before the vote @entity46 , general secretary of the @entity43 ( @entity44 ) , had written to members – the company ’s equivalent to shareholders – urging them to reject the bonus plan			0
afterwards , mr @entity46 said the union was ‘ bitterly disappointed ’ by the plan			0
‘ once again public members of @entity7 have put the interests of bosses ahead of passengers , ’ he said			1
‘ these bosses will be on board a very lucrative gravy train while the poor passengers pay through the nose with annual above - inflation fare rises			2
’ it was voted on by @entity7 ’s 44 ‘ members ’			2
their job is to hold the board to account			0
top dollar : financial director @entity70 ( left ) and chief executive @entity36 ( right ) earn £ 394,000 and £ 577,000 respectively			1
they are to receive £ 11million over three years with their three fellow executives bonuses : the director of operations @entity76 ( left ) and strategy director @entity78 ( right ) earn £ 371,000 and £ 348,000			1
their annual bonuses are worth up to 60 per cent of their basic income condemned : critics say bosses like @entity84 ( pictured ) should not be given the bonuses when they have missed targets and customers are paying more for tickets but as a company limited by guarantee , its members do not have any financial interest in the company , which is supposed to put its profits back into maintaining the railways			1
chief executive of @entity98 , @entity99 , said : ‘ passengers will wonder why bonuses are being paid if the service is getting worse			0
‘ we support incentives for improved services , but bonuses should be tied to passenger satisfaction , not be rewards for failure			0
’ @entity110 ’s transport spokesman , @entity109 , also condemned the move			1
she said : ‘ commuters facing inflation - busting fare rises will be outraged at the scale of the bonus packages being enjoyed by a few at the top of the rail industry			2
‘ with passengers facing overcrowded services and too many delayed and cancelled trains , it is wrong for @entity7 to be paying out such large sums to its senior managers			2
‘ it will particularly anger passengers that these bonuses are being paid for a year when @entity7 has failed to meet its own performance target on train punctuality			1
’ she added that ministers should ‘ make it clear that bonuses on this scale are simply not appropriate in a company that receives nearly £ 4billion of taxpayers ’ money every year ’			2
@entity7 has defended the long - term bonus , saying it is intended ‘ to recognise outstanding and exceptional performance over the three years to 2015 ’			2
it said any future awards would be measured against train performance , savings made for the taxpayer and the successful delivery of congestion easing projects , each of which has ‘ tough ’ targets			2
@entity7 chairman @entity150 , who does not receive any bonuses , said : ‘ @entity7 executives are rewarded only when exceptional performance exceeds tough targets , which have been approved by our members through an open and transparent process			1
‘ if targets are not met , or safety comprised , no bonuses are made			2
’ he insisted the firm had made exceptional progress over the past 12 months , with passenger numbers rising to 1.5billion			0
the annual bonuses scheme already pays bosses up to 60 per cent of their salary provided they meet targets on punctuality as well as train company and passenger satisfaction			1
controversial : @entity7 members have approved a fresh lucrative bonus package for its top directors - despite fierce criticism from unions about the firm 's performance but those targets were missed last year , so executives received just 17 per cent rather than the maximum 60 per cent of salary			1
a spokesman for the @entity182 said : ‘ @entity7 has a licence requiring it to have a remuneration and bonus scheme to ensure that it encourages high standards of performance			0
‘ the company is responsible for delivering key @entity190 infrastructure and large investment projects which are of huge value to rail users , taxpayers and the economy			0
it is vitally important that it is able to secure the right talent and leadership			0
’ the £ 40billion high - speed rail line should be ditched because hologram technology will supercede it , @entity201 ’s new business guru said yesterday			0
lord @entity204 said the @entity206 line linking @entity207 to @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 would be made redundant within 20 years			0
@entity211 uses lasers to create lifelike images in the air			0
lord @entity204 suggested businessmen would be able to beam images of themselves to meetings , removing the need for travel .			0
