by @entity0 , royal correspondent published : 06:06 est , 16 april 2013 updated : 07:40 est , 16 april 2013 they are both royalty , of sorts			0
she is the niece of the late @entity5 , while he is touted as one of the most outstanding @entity9 batsmen of his generation , whose cricketer grandfather remains an icon to lovers of the game			2
stepping out for the first time as a couple this week , @entity15 and @entity16 – grandson of the legendary @entity19 - made a dazzling couple – impossibly good looking , blue - eyed , tousled blondes			1
and far from being concerned that @entity25 might have inherited her family ’s marital curse ( her father , @entity24 , has of late married his third wife and fathered his seventh child ) , @entity16 ’s family have welcomed her with open arms			1
@entity15 and boyfriend @entity16 have kept their romance under wraps until now , but @entity16 's mother says it began last year the pair appeared happy and in love when they appeared at a cricketing awards dinner at @entity40 's last week in their first public confirmation of their romance speaking exclusively to @entity42 from her home in @entity45 , @entity46 , the mother of the 29 - year - old sports star , who was @entity9 ’s leading run scorer last year and was this week named by @entity49 as their cricketer of the year , described prince @entity53 ’s pretty cousin as ‘ bright , funny , down - to - earth – without any airs and graces ’			1
@entity58 - born @entity57 , a newspaper sub-editor , revealed that the pair had been dating since september last year and @entity60 , 22 , had already flown over to meet her and husband @entity61			1
for his part , @entity16 who was born in @entity46 but educated at upper - crust @entity64 public school @entity62 , has visited the @entity24 ’s ancestral home , @entity67 in @entity68 , and told his parents that he was ‘ blown away ’			1
‘ he said it was unbelievable …			0
magnificent , ’ mrs @entity57 said			0
spirited aristocratic beauty @entity25 was raised in @entity72 after her mother , former model @entity74 ’s , marriage to @entity24 acrimoniously broke down in the face of his infidelity as well as her own eating disorder and battles with alcohol and drug addictions			1
ironically , however , @entity25 , who has been named as one of the eligible girls in the country by society bible @entity85 , and @entity16 did not meet until she came to @entity9 last year to study for an @entity87 in luxury brand management			1
the pair were introduced by a mutual friend from @entity72 and hit it off straight away , exchanging flirty messages on the social networking site @entity94 with @entity60 teasingly calling her new man ‘ granddad ’ due to their seven - year age gap			0
@entity60 ( centre ) with her sisters , twins @entity99 and @entity100 , 18 , attracted attention at the marriage of prince @entity53 for their fashion choices and good looks @entity25 is the daughter of the @entity107 and @entity74 , though their marriage ended due to his infidelity as well as the former model 's mental health problems ‘ they ’ve only known each other for a short while , since september or october last year and i have no idea where their relationship is going			2
but they have seemed to have carried on [ to the next level ] , ’ mr @entity16 ’s mother said			1
the family met @entity25 for the first time over @entity120 when she joined @entity16 at their family holiday cottage in @entity123 , on the picturesque @entity124 , for the @entity16 family ’s annual holiday			1
apparently she drove down from @entity72 by herself to spend time with them			0
a friend said : ‘ for her to do that she has to be super keen on him			0
for @entity25 that ’s like driving across @entity46 … ’ ‘ i was really impressed			1
she ’s very bright , she ’s cheerful , down to earth and funny			1
and she ’s stunning looking and very natural , ’ mrs @entity57 , who gave the @entity132 this photograph taken during that holiday , recalled			2
@entity16 is touted as one of the most outstanding @entity9 batsmen of his generation ‘ she ’s different , a really lively character who is interested in things and interesting to talk to			1
she ’s had a completely different upbringing to @entity16 and that must be difficult to cope with but it does n’t show			1
she ’s got no airs or graces			0
’ asked whether her son was ‘ keen on @entity60 ’ , mrs @entity57 said with the kind of toe - curling candour only a mother can : ‘ of course he is keen on her ! he has n’t had many girlfriends because he ’s always been really focussed on his cricket and has n’t had time for relationships			1
but he is still with @entity25 … ‘ but she insisted her genial son , who is known as a gentleman both and on and off the field , was n’t fazed by her status or aristocratic lineage			0
‘ no , @entity16 is a very down to earth person			2
he ’s completely honest and straight			2
he says what he thinks			0
so i do n’t think it really matters at all , ’ she said			0
@entity16 's grandfather , @entity19 , right , is a sporting legend while @entity25 's @entity162 is the @entity163 , right ‘ @entity16 has also never shied away from the cameras			1
he ’s very easy going in tv interviews , very good at talking to people and always outgoing			0
‘ they do look the part do n’t they ? they look comfortable together			0
they are quite different in some ways … their backgrounds are very different … but they make each other laugh and he feels very comfortable in her company			0
’ she added laughing : ‘ her dad is also very keen on cricket so that counts			0
‘ @entity16 ’s met her family , but i have no idea if they approve			2
i have n’t met them , but they seem like very nice people			0
’ @entity60 should also be impressed by @entity16 ’s own , some might say more illustrious , family lineage			1
@entity15 is a first cousin of the @entity189 and @entity190 his grandfather , @entity19 , played 78 tests for @entity9 - as well being a top class footballer , playing in the fa cup for @entity195 in 1950 and taking a winner ’s medal			1
sixty years ago this summer he hit the run that won the ashes for @entity9 – and his grandson is tipped to help his country retain the series this year			0
he has also inherited his grandfather ’s model looks			0
@entity19 was dubbed the @entity205 after advertising the brand and @entity16 is cutting quite a dash himself off the field , too			2
so could @entity25 be ‘ the one ’ , then ? ‘ i think it might be a bit too early to say that , ’ his mother said			2
‘ @entity16 is probably going to kill me [ for saying all this ] ! ’			0

stunning blonde couple only went public with romance at event last week
@entity16 , 29 , plays cricket for @entity9 like illustrious grandfather @entity19
@entity25 , 22 , is first cousin to the @entity189 and @entity190
@entity16 's mother , @entity57 , says @entity25 has already flown to meet them
' i was really impressed . she ’s very bright , cheerful and down to earth '
' she ’s had a completely different upbringing to @entity16 and that must be difficult to cope with '
