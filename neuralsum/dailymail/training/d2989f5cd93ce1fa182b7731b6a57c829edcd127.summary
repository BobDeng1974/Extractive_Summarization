they were n't bad either			2
here 's @entity25 's a-z of @entity11 football in 2014			1
a for @entity13 @entity12 ’s team became the first since @entity29 ’s @entity28 in 2004 to break the big - two ’s stranglehold on @entity15 when they won it in may thanks to @entity32 ’s goals , @entity33 ’ saves , some @entity34 , and the brooding boss who made them believe			1

@entity42 was on the halfway line when he started his race with @entity41 , he ran off the pitch and back on it and still out - sprinted the defender to score the winner			2
c for court @entity16 spent too much time there in 2014			2
they were taken to court by one of their own supporters over the @entity61 transfer ; and then went to the court of arbitration ( @entity62 ) over @entity63 banning them from making transfers			2
@entity23 went to court over tax evasion , and @entity68 also went to @entity62 to appeal a ban on him training with his new @entity16 team - mates			2
d for @entity71 you may have heard @entity5 supporters mention this once or twice			1
the tenth @entity6 was finally won in @entity75 in may after 12 years of trying			1
they spent a billion and sacked 10 managers along the way but they got there with a 4 - 1 win over @entity13			1
the @entity5 team celebrate with manager @entity82 after winning their tenth @entity6 @entity83 hails ' unforgettable year ' for @entity5 e for @entity84 abroad the first man @entity82 embraced on the touchline at the final whistle was his no 2 @entity88			1
becoming a no 1 somewhere will be the @entity91 ’s next step			2
@entity92 is for @entity93 nicknamed ‘ the noodle ’ , @entity94 began the year losing his place to @entity42 at @entity5 but he ended up playing alongside @entity42 , scoring in the @entity45 final , winning @entity98 in the @entity6 final and moving to @entity100			1
@entity101 is for @entity102 the rock at the heart of defence scored the goal that won the league for @entity13 at the @entity108 on the last day of the season			1
@entity110 is for hoops after 115 years of wearing stripes @entity16 revealed in december that they will wear hoops next season			0
the fans say it ’s sacrilegious ; the kit - makers say it’a lucrative – both are probably right			0
i is for @entity120 after a terrible @entity122 @entity5 ’s legendary goalkeeper looked all washed up			1
but he ’s back to his best and in november told @entity25 : ' i want to play until i ’m 40 '			0
@entity124 ( centre ) holds the @entity126 aloft following @entity5 's win against @entity128 @entity129 is for @entity130 @entity132 in the @entity133 the 18 - year - old @entity131 is destined for big things both for club and country			1
@entity137 is for @entity138 not often @entity139 make a mistake in the transfer market			0

that is what @entity161 hope to be able to say in the coming years as @entity157 works his magic at their @entity165 youth academy			0
he took over in november			0
@entity168 is for @entity61 he has already topped the nine league goals he scored in his first season			0
and he ’s kept himself busy off the pitch , flying model @entity172 into @entity16 in october			0
@entity174 is for odd signings @entity16 needed to rebuild their defence this summer			0
they signed @entity177 right back @entity178 for £ 4.4m and @entity179 for £ 15m			0

at 28 , he has already played over 300 @entity5 games			1
@entity204 ' header hauled @entity5 back into the @entity6 final , which they ended up winning @entity211 is for seventeen some say @entity22 only scores so many goals because of weak @entity15 defences			1

@entity224 for @entity225 @entity227 coach @entity226 led his team to @entity230 glory in may			0
his reward ? the same as every other year – his best players were sold			0
@entity226 won the @entity230 with @entity227 in may but his best players left the club soon after @entity235 is for @entity236 do you really want to be kicking the ball straight at @entity12 when the @entity239 has just let the @entity6 slip ? @entity12 stormed on to the pitch to confront @entity236 and earned an eight - match ban			1
