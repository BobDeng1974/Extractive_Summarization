the @entity1 has a new bad boy			1
@entity3 completed a loan move to @entity5 from @entity6 on tuesday , but in @entity8 they are simply glad to see the back of him			1
despite his obvious talent , the @entity11 winger has disappointed in his two spells as a @entity15 player			0
like @entity16 's controversial frontman @entity0 , @entity3 is more accustomed to grabbing headlines for his misdemeanours off the pitch , rather than his achievements on it			1
the winger first came to the @entity15 when he joined @entity23 in 2009			2
after two years of failing to live up to expectations , the @entity11 left the club in 2011 under a cloud of controversy			0
2013 - caught speeding at 3am alongside now @entity40 midfielder @entity39			1
it was alleged that the pair had insulted and acted agressivley towards the police officer			0
2014 - @entity46 ' @entity45 ' ahead of @entity6 vs @entity23 clash before insulting a fan of his own team via @entity50			1
he complained that the team 's style did n't suit him , and that the club had not looked after him during an ankle operation			0
@entity23 fined him for his complaints , and @entity3 stormed off to @entity36			1
one disappointing year later , he was back in the north of @entity8 , signing for @entity23 's arch rivals @entity6			1
the club shelled out £ 4.5m for the player and put him on a £ 2m salary			0
@entity3 was billed as “ the man who will shoot @entity6 back into @entity62 ”			1
instead , the club have spent two and a half seasons loitering around the relegation zone , and @entity3 has shown the worst side of his character in a host of off the field scandals			2
in april 2013 , the @entity11 was caught speeding at 3am alongside then team - mate @entity39			1
it was later alleged that the two players had acted aggressively when stopped , and had insulted a police officer			0
@entity3 ( left ) will join the club on january 3 with a view to a permanent transfer next summer @entity0 has scored just one @entity1 goal since joining @entity16 as punishment , the two players were made to train in isolation for the rest of the season			1
it was the final straw at @entity83 , who left for @entity40 that summer			0
@entity3 stayed , however , though there was little change in his behaviour			2
this month alone , the 27 - year - old has been at the centre of two social media scandals			1
before the derby game against @entity23 , @entity3 tweeted the words “ @entity45 ” , a phrase which does n't go down too well in @entity8			1
he later insulted a @entity6 fan on @entity50 , telling them to “ go f * * * yourself ”			2
on the pitch , too , @entity3 has repeatedly failed to live up to expectations , with only four goals in 66 appearances for @entity6			2
the @entity103 midfielder has become known for being a difficult character to handle off the pitch new coach @entity106 accused the player of arrogance , saying that ' it would be nice to see a bit more effort from him			0
he needs to realise that his job is about more than just annoying his team mates			0
' a flop on the pitch , a perpetual irritation off it , @entity6 were desperate to get rid of @entity3			2
' he is a good player , but he has n't really performed for us			0
when a player with this kind of contract is n't even in the squad , you have to think about moving him on ' , said director of sport @entity123			0
perhaps wary of his reputation , @entity5 declined to buy @entity3 straight away , but the @entity5 do will have that option in the summer			1
whether they act on it will depend on @entity129			0
if the @entity11 manager can realise his compatriot 's potential , credit to him			0
if not , @entity133 may spend the next six months plagued by the poor man 's @entity0			0
@entity5 boss @entity129 could have his work cut out when @entity3 arrives at the club			2

@entity3 will join @entity5 from @entity6 in january
@entity3 has a bad boy reputation after a *turbulent* time in @entity8
the winger has been fined @entity23 and caught speeding in the past
27 - year - old seems to be on similar path to @entity0
