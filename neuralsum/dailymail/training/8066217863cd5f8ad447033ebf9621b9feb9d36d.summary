by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 19:55 est , 16 june 2013 updated : 06:06 est , 17 june 2013 @entity3 is at the centre of a fresh spying scandal today after its agents apparently intercepted phone calls and monitored the computers of foreign officials at two major meetings held in @entity11			1
it is alleged the @entity3 's secret services even tricked delegates into using internet cafes they had set up at the 2009 @entity17 summits to allow @entity3 intelligence agencies to easily read their emails			1
@entity21 documents seen by the @entity22 , labelled top secret , even bragged about the ' successes ' of spying at @entity17 , and named at least two targets of the spying - long - standing allies @entity27 and @entity28			1
a large number of smartphones and @entity31 were tapped to harvest confidential calls , emails and documents , which ' provided timely information to @entity3 ministers ' , according to confidential slides leaked by @entity38 whistleblower @entity37			1
the embarrassing news comes as @entity3 prepares to host a @entity40 for nations which were all present - and spied upon - in 2009			1
keeping a close watch : world leaders pictured at the @entity17 summit in april 2009			0
the @entity22 has reported that @entity21 spied on foreign representatives while they were in the @entity3 it raises new questions about the boundaries of surveillance by @entity21 , the @entity3 intelligence agency , and its @entity38 sister organisation , the @entity51			2
ministers say access to phone records and internet data is necessary in the fight against terrorism and serious crime			0
the 2009 spying appears to have been organised for a less important purpose - securing an advantage in meetings			0
secrets : the data about the apparent @entity3 spying is alleged to have come from @entity37			1
a former technical assistant for the @entity67 who has fled to @entity68 eavesdropping : @entity21 , @entity3 's electronic listening agency , mounted an intensive spying operation on foreign politicians attending two @entity17 summit meetings in @entity11 in 2009 , it has been reported during @entity17 meetings in april and september 2009 , @entity21 used what one document calls ‘ ground - breaking intelligence capabilities ’ to intercept the communications of visiting delegations			1
this included setting up internet cafes where they used an email interception programme and key - logging software to spy on delegates ’ use of computers ; and penetrating the security on delegates ’ @entity31 to monitor their email messages and phone calls			1
other moves also include supplying 45 analysts with a live round - the - clock summary of who was phoning who at the summit ; and targeting the @entity27 finance minister and possibly 15 others in his party			0
embarrassing : as @entity104 arrives with his family for @entity40 today , details of the spying at previous @entity17 summits emerged the documents suggest that the operation was sanctioned in principle at a senior level in the government of @entity111 , the then prime minister - and that intelligence , including briefings for visiting delegates , was passed to @entity3 ministers			1
an outline of the objectives of ' spying ' on delegates written by @entity21 director sir @entity120 was handed out to officials , according to @entity22			0
one report seen by the newspaper explains the efforts that @entity51 specialists working at @entity126 in @entity127 went to to decode encrypted telephone calls by @entity130 president @entity129			0
powerful : @entity17 leaders including @entity38 president @entity104 , @entity133 prime minister @entity132 and @entity130 president @entity129 were at the summit at the @entity135 in @entity11 summit : @entity138 prime minister @entity137 ( left ) , @entity140 chancellor , @entity139 ( centre ) and her finance minister , @entity143 during the round table session at the @entity145 in april 2009 in a september meeting of @entity17 finance ministers @entity21 details of intercepted calls were displayed on a giant screen of the organisation 's operations centre as well as to individual officials ' screens			2
that information was then quickly passed on to @entity3 delegates at the summit to provide them information to use for negotiations			2
officials were also able to get hold of advanced copies of @entity17 briefings to ministers by bypassing @entity166 security			0
@entity21 was able to spy on the foreign diplomats under the 1994 @entity168 ( @entity168 ) which allows @entity3 's security services to conduct such operations with ministerial authority			0
important : then - prime minister @entity111 made the summit a top strategic priority the law includes a clause which says that agencies should operate ' in the interests of economic wellbeing of the @entity3 '			2
the @entity168 was greeted with great suspicion by @entity181 countries when it came into force because countries were concerned that @entity3 companies would have access to intelligence that would give them a competitive edge over rival foreign firms			0
it is not clear whether @entity168 was specifically invoked for the @entity17 meetings but then - prime minister @entity111 had made the summit a strategic priority so it was likely that it had .			0
