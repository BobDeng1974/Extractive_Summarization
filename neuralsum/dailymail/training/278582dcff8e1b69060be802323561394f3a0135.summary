@entity0 is no ordinary grandmother			2
she has conquered deserts , the @entity2 and the jungle on foot in a number of gruelling ' ultra marathons '			0
now she is set to challenge herself again by running 1,460 miles across @entity7			2
the 52 - year - old from @entity9 is joining forces with @entity12 ultra runner @entity11 , 29 , to take on the epic journey			1
long journey ahead : @entity0 is an experienced distance runner but she said taking on the @entity15 in @entity7 will be her biggest challenge yet the pair will run together along the @entity15 , an off - road route starting in @entity19 and finishing in @entity20 , just outside @entity21			1
the route requires navigational skills , river crossings and scrambling across rocks in parts and will take the pair just over a month to complete - running a total of 56 marathons back - to - back			1
although both are experienced endurance athletes , @entity0 told @entity31 that taking on the @entity15 will be one of the hardest things she has ever done			1
' for both of us this will be the biggest challenge of our running careers , ' she said			1
' running an average of 80km per day for 32 days is n't something to be taken lightly and technical running is n't my forte			1
road ahead : the @entity15 in @entity7 starts in @entity19 and finishes in @entity20 , just outside @entity21 ' but i believe that in order to grow as a person we all need to do things that take us way out of our comfort zone , each time pushing just that little bit further â€“ this project will push me further than i have ever pushed myself before , in many ways			2
' @entity0 and @entity11 are putting themselves though the long - distance run with the support of @entity55 in order to raise money for girls and women in @entity7			1
@entity0 , who has achieved three @entity60 including being the fastest woman to run from @entity62 to @entity63 , said : ' both of us felt that if we were to take on a challenge as big as this we wanted to raise money to help @entity7 girls and women			1
@entity11 is 29 and i 'm 52 , two women , two generations and two pairs of legs supporting others			0
' not going it alone : the grandmother - of - three , pictured here during another endurance race , will be joined by @entity11 as they run about 80k a day for 32 days they are aiming to raise awareness and funds to set up of a social enterprise business in the @entity82 of @entity7 that will employ a dozen @entity7 women to make re-usable sanitary pads in order to keep girls in education			1
the pair were shocked at how many girls are missing out on school because of a lack of adequate sanitary products			1
@entity0 explained : ' once they reach puberty , one in three @entity7 girls miss out on four or five days of school per month because they can not afford to buy sanitary pads			1
instead they stay at home and use anything from old rags and rolled up newspapers - anything they can get their hands on			0
eventually they drop out of school altogether			0
' the grandmother - of - three said thinking about the cause will keep her pushing on when the going gets tough when the race gets underway in september			0
accomplishment : @entity0 has previously ran the @entity111 ultra marathon in @entity112 twice in a row she said : ' many people have asked me what is driving us to run this ridiculously long distance			2
the answer is simple ; we are absolutely passionate about the cause for which we are running			0
' we are both lucky and have had privileged backgrounds where education was a given , enabling us to make choices about our futures , the @entity7 girls in rural communities are n't always so lucky			2
' by supporting girls to remain in education it will enable them to make a lasting and positive impact on the communities they live in and society as a whole			0
' @entity0 is no stranger to such endeavors for charities			0
her many other endurance feats include the fastest crossing on foot across @entity140 ( 345 miles in three days , 15 hours and nearly 37 minutes ) , doing the infamous @entity141 in @entity142 twice back - to - back and completing the @entity144 ultra in the @entity146 desert			0
inspirational : @entity0 only took up running at the age of 36 and it has helped her overcome an eating disorder what makes @entity0 's achievements ever more remarkable is that in her youth , she suffered from an eating disorder and only took up running at the age of 36			1
it was the joy of running that gave her the impetus to overcome anorexia			0
she explains : ' running means i have to eat , otherwise my body simply would n't have enough energy			0
so i 'm no longer afraid of food , it 's not the enemy but an essential part of life			0
running quite literally has given me back my life which otherwise may have turned out so differently			0
' if you would like to support @entity0 and @entity11 's marathon efforts , make a donation to the charity via www.freedomrunners.org or http://www.pozible.com/project/183111#p2 @entity0 and @entity11 are still looking for corporate / individual sponsors who might be interested in supporting the expedition side of their run , if interested , contact @entity0 via her website @entity179			2
