@entity1 manager @entity0 has hit out at @entity3 disciplinary rules after @entity5 's seven - match ban for racist language was upheld			1
@entity5 was described as neither a credible nor a reliable witness by an @entity3 - appointed judicial panel in a report that was published following the failure of his appeal			1
the report revealed @entity15 defender @entity14 had accused @entity5 of calling him a ' black c * * * ' during a @entity18 match on september 13 and the panel found the on - loan @entity21 winger guilty after describing the @entity15 player as an ' impressive witness '			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 hit out at the @entity3 's decision to uphold @entity5 's ( left ) seven - match ban @entity0 ( left ) said that @entity1 supports on - loan winger @entity5 ( right ) as there is no real proof of racist language the @entity3 's disciplinary rules , like civil court cases , do not require that guilt be established beyond reasonable doubt , unlike criminal cases			1
the criteria for finding @entity5 guilty was summed up in the report as ' it is more likely than not that the subject of the complaint committed the act of misconduct alleged '			1
but @entity0 feels more proof was needed - no one else heard the offending words , although @entity14 quickly told others			1
the @entity47 said : ' you ca n't judge a person on word against word , in my opinion			0
you will never do that in any real court			0
' there is no proof and we still believe him			2
we will continue to do that when we do n't have any other proof			2
' you call another person a racist just on a word ? i ca n't understand this happening			2
' for me , if you are going to judge someone you have to do it with real proof and not word against word			2
because a @entity74 guy , with not very good @entity75 , is going to defend himself ? not so easy			1
' @entity1 vowed to address issues raised in the proceedings with the @entity3 but there appears to be no recourse for challenging the decision again			1
' i do n't think there is any possibility to go further , ' @entity0 said			1
' we have to take the penalty but we still feel it is not right and we believe @entity5 in full			1
' @entity1 have consistently stood by @entity5 and there appears little chance of him being returned to @entity21 midway through his season - long loan			1
' he still has a future here , ' @entity0 said			1
' of course it is going to be difficult being seven games out but that 's football			2
the most important thing is we stay behind him and support him			0
' we are going to give him some days off to go to @entity74 for @entity99 and when he comes back he will be fighting to get back in the team			1
' he is very disappointed of course but he moves on			0
he knows his innocence and he will just keep on going			0
' @entity15 's @entity103 accused @entity5 of calling him a ' black c * * * ' in their game at @entity107 on september 13 @entity1 captain @entity108 ( centre ) showed his support of @entity5 and said his teammates stand by him @entity0 insisted there had been no approaches for @entity114 or @entity115 ahead of the transfer window the damning nature of the report might make it difficult for @entity5 when going to opposition grounds but @entity0 does not feel the player will be universally condemned			1
' i think football fans are clever people as well , ' he said			0
' they can see behind the case and behind the results as well			0
i say we have to have proof			0
' and he feels the 24 - year - old will still want to play in @entity3			1
' i think so but i have n't talked a lot about this , ' @entity0 said			1
' but he is training well for the two days and he seems good			0
' @entity1 skipper @entity108 reaffirmed his support for his team - mate			2
' we all stick by him , we know what happened and stuff like that , ' @entity108 said			0
' his training has been excellent , he has enjoyed training and there has been good banter with the lads as well			0
' it 's going to be hard , it 's a long few games he is going to be out for but he will work in training , he will work on his fitness and when he 's available he will be back in the squad			0
' he has spoken to the players and we all stand by him			0
' there was more controversy in the @entity3 disciplinary procedures this week when @entity153 midfielder @entity152 was banned for two games for spitting despite being publicly backed by his alleged victim , @entity15 winger @entity155			1
the suspension rules @entity152 out of an awkward meeting with @entity1 on sunday as he awaits the procurator fiscal to consider charges against him for an alleged assault on @entity1 goalkeeper @entity162			1
when asked about the issue , @entity0 said : ' i do n't think we will use any energy on that			2
we are looking forward to the game and this is outside the pitch			0
' i was at @entity170 last weekend and they are very , very nice people			0
there is a good culture at that club			0
' again , we do n't have any proof about that			0
it 's a football game and we are looking forward to it			0
' meanwhile , @entity0 insisted there had been no approaches for @entity114 or @entity115 but confirmed he had taken 22 - year - old @entity182 midfielder @entity181 on trial this week			2
the @entity185 - born player was previously with @entity186 and @entity187 and had a loan spell under @entity0 at @entity189			2
' he is a player i know from before , ' @entity0 said			2
' i have n't decided yet if he is going to stay for some more or he is going to go back			0
