they could be strike partners for @entity1 next month and , at this rate , for some years to come			0
on tuesday night , however , @entity3 and @entity4 found themselves on opposing teams with very different goals in mind			1
the shootout between two of @entity1 's most prolific marksmen became a focal point for what was otherwise a breathless , exhilarating encounter featuring two teams built to attack			2
@entity17 will have been as interested a spectator as anyone as he weighs up his options for the forthcoming @entity21 qualifier against @entity22 at @entity23 on march 27 and the friendly with @entity25 four days later			1
@entity4 re-arranged his feet brilliantly to take @entity28 â€™s pass and score in the 26th minute @entity30 goalkeeper @entity29 looks on as @entity32 striker @entity4 makes it 1 - 1 at @entity34 the @entity32 forward wheels away to celebrate after scoring his 23rd goal in all competitions this season @entity4 celebrates with team - mate @entity38 in front of the @entity32 support following his first - half equaliser @entity4 arrived on @entity42 on tuesday night having just upstaged two of his rivals for an @entity1 place ; 10 days earlier he had scored twice at the @entity46 to overshadow @entity48 's @entity47			1
then on saturday , of course , came that double in the @entity51 at @entity52 to eclipse @entity53 and give @entity32 a memorable victory over @entity55			0
tuesday night was arguably an even tougher proposition			0
@entity3 might have missed the majority of the season with a combination of thigh and calf injuries , but he remains @entity1 's pre-eminent striker and the one most likely to be first on @entity17 's teamsheet when fully fit			1
coincidentally , the two men had an identical record of 15 goals from their last 20 @entity67 starts			2
@entity4 got another one on tuesday night and has now scored all of his 13 @entity67 goals since november , while @entity3 's injury issues inevitably meant that his record stretched back well into last season when he formed a prolific partnership with @entity74			1
@entity3 wins a penalty for @entity30 following a clumsy challenge from @entity77 @entity78 stepped up to convert the resulting penalty during a frantic contest at @entity34 in fact , tuesday night was his first start since last august and a 3 - 0 win over @entity32 at a time when @entity4 was only considered good enough for the substitutes ' bench			1
@entity30 manager @entity88 has no doubt that @entity4 is worthy of his first senior @entity1 call - up after eight goals in 10 internationals for the under - 21s , but had said on the eve of this game that ' as an @entity98 striker there 's no - one better than ' @entity3			1
' for me , @entity3 clearly has everything as a top @entity102 striker , ' @entity88 said before kick - off last night			2
' if we can get him on the field regularly now he will show that			0
@entity3 was making his first start for @entity30 since last august following an injury - ravaged season ' but it 's brilliant for young @entity4 seeing him as a young player coming through the system			1
he 's a terrific talent and it shows you that , given the opportunity , a homegrown player can come in and do very well			0
i 'm delighted to see him do that and i hope it will continue after tonight			0
' it 's hard to see how @entity17 can ignore @entity4 now			2
the @entity32 man continued his remarkable run of form by scoring the first - half equaliser that takes his total in all competitions to 23 by mid january			2
no @entity67 striker has scored more			1
it was another well - taken goal by the 21 - year - old who managed to re-arrange his feet to take @entity28 's pass in the 26th minute when @entity131 was falling over his			0
reds keeper @entity29 does well to thwart a goal - bound effort from @entity4 during the second - half once again , @entity4 went for power rather than precision , and @entity29 just could n't keep it out			0
he then helped set up @entity32 's second equaliser for @entity141 and , on that basis , you would have to say that he just about shaded the duel with @entity3			1
the @entity30 striker is not one to be easily outdone , however			0
in his defence , @entity3 is getting back to full fitness			0
he was still enough of a handful to win the penalty that enabled @entity78 to restore @entity30 's lead early in the second half when @entity3 's jinking run invited a clumsy challenge from @entity77			1
@entity1 manager @entity17 ( centre ) will have been watching @entity3 and @entity4 closely at @entity34 as he weighs up his options for the forthcoming @entity21 qualifier against @entity22 in march both he and @entity156 are clearly high on confidence			1
@entity4 tried his luck with an effort from the half way line in the first half , while @entity3 sent an audacious backheel against the post			0
@entity164 made two saves from @entity3 in the early stages and was relieved to see @entity167 recover to deny the former @entity169 striker with a magnificent block after @entity171 contributed to a catalogue of defensive errors by @entity32 with an awful pass			2
@entity167 then produced another fantastic tackle on @entity3 in the second half when @entity30 fans were screaming for a second penalty			2
by the end , they had to be happy with a point			0
@entity4 and @entity3 had both made theirs .			0

@entity30 defeated @entity32 3 - 2 in a breathless encounter at @entity34
@entity4 scored scored @entity32 ' first and set up @entity141 's goal
@entity3 won the penalty which @entity78 converted
