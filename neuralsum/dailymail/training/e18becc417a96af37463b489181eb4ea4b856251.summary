by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has branded @entity4 ’s opening @entity6 encounter with @entity7 as the game from hell for @entity11 ’s side			1
while the @entity13 chairman stopped short of publicly declaring that @entity11 ’s job is safe whatever happens here in @entity17 , he did stress how difficult a group @entity4 face			1
at the draw last december @entity2 memorably made a throat - cutting gesture when @entity4 found themselves in the same group as @entity7 , @entity24 and @entity25 , and he was reminded of that yesterday			1

‘ but we sat there and said there were two things we did n’t want			2
we did n’t want @entity7 and we did n’t want @entity40 , and we got both ! ’ in the past @entity2 has said @entity11 ’s job is safe irrespective of @entity4 ’s results			1
that his contract runs until @entity46 in @entity47 and that he will continue in charge until then			2
indeed @entity49 , the @entity13 general secretary , has said the same			1
on tuesday , @entity2 would not quite commit to that position			1
‘ i ’ve got a lot of time for @entity11 , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’m a big fan			2
’ but asked if @entity11 would remain @entity4 manager regardless of what happens , @entity2 said : ‘ well who knows ? he ’s contracted to			1
‘ we would n’t want to discuss what happens to him afterwards because this is the moment when things should be going well			0
so it ’s not appropriate to discuss that now			0
but i ’m a big fan of @entity11 ’s			1
‘ i would say we would obviously hope to get out of the group and then after that … ‘ but it ’s a tough group			0
i think one of the reasons we are coming here with less expectation is because it ’s such a tough group			0
i was looking at the @entity47 group the other day			0

even if what he said had a ring of truth about it			0
‘ what i ’m surprised about this city is the fact that you would n’t know there is a @entity6 going on , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’m told there ’s all sorts of politics			0
there is real concern about the protesters			0
some people do n’t want @entity17 to win because they do n’t want the government to get re-elected			0
‘ the only reason you ’d know there ’s a @entity6 here is because half the people are on strike and you ca n’t get from the airport			2
‘ the people i ’ve been talking to are of the view that it ’s very quiet			0
it does bring up the question for the future , because clearly there are a lot of people in this country who think too much money has been spent when there are extremes of poverty			0
