an incredible whirlwind of gas and fire , swirling 3,280ft into the air , has been captured above @entity6 ’s @entity5 volcano			2
the stunning footage was taken last week by an aircraft - fitted infrared camera designed to monitor potentially dangerous ash clouds			1
scientists are still unsure what caused the tornado - like phenomenon , but have suggested it may be due to the difference between hot and colder air , causing something akin to a ‘ dust devil			1
dust devils are small , rotating columns of air which can be seen because of the dust and debris they pick up from the ground			2
they form because hot air close to the ground rises , punching through the layer of cooler denser air above			1
the rising plumes of hot air and falling plumes of cool air begin circulating vertically in something known as ‘ convection cells ’			1
this amazing aerial shots of the erupting @entity5 , @entity6 's largest volcano			2
was taken by a helicopter hovering over the molten lava by photographer @entity57 steam and smoke rise over a fissure in a lava field north of the @entity63 glacier , which covers part of @entity5 volcano system			0
yesterday morning , an earthquake struck the region around the volcano while fissures in the area continued to spew out lava scientists are watching closely to see how molten rock at and below the surface will interact with glacial ice , surface melt , and groundwater if a horizontal gust of wind blows , it turns the circulating air cells , so they begin spinning horizontally , forming vertical columns - and starting a dust devil			1
@entity5 , which has erupted more lava than any other volcano on the planet in the last 10,000 years , has awakened since mid-august			0

yesterday morning , an earthquake struck the region around the volcano while fissures in the area continued to spew out lava			0
the earthquake occurred at 0808 bst and reached a magnitude of 5.4 , making it one of the bigger quakes in the area in central @entity6 since significant tremors began on august 16			0
' there was also another quake , magnitude 4.6 at 0430 ( bst ) in the night , ' said @entity128 , geologist at the @entity129			0
' seismic activity underneath @entity5 volcano is still ongoing but remains steady , ' she added			0
lava from the fissures around @entity5 has so far reached the surface only on land that is not covered by ice			0
but scientists warn an eruption under an ice cap may be explosive and result in an ash cloud that could under certain circumstances disrupt aviation			0
in 2010 , a cloud of abrasive ash from the @entity146 volcano , in a different region of @entity6 , closed much of @entity149 's air space for six days after an eruption under the ice cap			2
the ash warning level for aviation related to the current fissure eruptions remained at orange , the second - highest level on a five - colour scale , after several brief hikes to the top red in recent weeks			0
the @entity160 says the lava eruptions and fire fountains from @entity163 currently present no threat to flights			1
hot air rising above @entity5 , located under @entity63 , @entity6 's most extensive glacier , is thought to have created the tornado of fire images of the gaping fissure , volatile lava fountains and a billowing cloud of steam and gas reveal the raw beauty and brute force of volcanic activity @entity5 has erupted more lava than any other volcano on the planet in the last 10,000 years			1
the ancient volcano sits below a central @entity6 glacier @entity184 fountains danced along a lengthy volcanic fissure near @entity6 's subglacial @entity5 volcano			2

@entity192 may have formed due to difference between hot and cold air
hot air close to volcano rises punching through layer of cool air above
circulating air currents then produce something similar to a dust devil
