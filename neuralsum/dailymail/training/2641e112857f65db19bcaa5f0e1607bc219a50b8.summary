the cunning game of cat and mouse between @entity4 ’s greatest detective and his nemesis @entity5 is the stuff of literary legend			1
and it almost seemed as if @entity10 star @entity9 was trying to outwit his on - screen adversary in real life yesterday , as he took ingenious steps to keep his wedding secret			1
yet actor @entity15 , who plays the master criminal in the latest @entity18 adaptation of sir @entity20 ’s books , nonetheless managed to find his way to the @entity23 church where the ceremony took place			1
pictured arriving at the church is @entity15 , who plays @entity9 's arch - rival @entity5 in @entity10 , and actor @entity30 ( top left ) intimate : the hasilty - arranged ceremony , organised to take place before pregnant @entity33 gives birth , took place in this church in front of friends and family today the bride and groom 's car , thought to be a classic @entity43 , was pictured pulling up to the church today , but there was no sign of mr @entity9 or miss @entity28 one especially stylish guest , dressed in a cream double - breasted waistcoat and tartan print trousers , waits outside the church on the @entity23 this morning @entity9 went to extraordinary lengths to keep his wedding secret , especially from the press and his fans			1
roads around the village of @entity58 were cordoned off , staff at the hotel where the wedding party celebrated were sworn to secrecy , and , in a particularly deft touch , a white van drew up outside the church at the crucial moment @entity9 and his new bride @entity28 emerged , blocking the view			1
the sneaky deployment of the vehicle was a sly echo of the moment in the 2012 tv series when the detective used a truck in the plot to fake his death			0
@entity15 has previously joked about his screen relationship with 38 - year - old @entity9 , reacting to the recent news that he is to become a dad , by joking : ‘ i do n’t think @entity9 will ask me to be a godfather			1
i ’m his arch nemesis			0

@entity102 , who plays @entity107 in @entity18 series @entity10 , was expected to be the best man it was thought that @entity111 , who starred alongside @entity9 in the @entity112 would attend , but she was spotted in @entity113 today invatations were sent to guests via email because the ceremony was organised at short notice , believed to be because the couple wanted it to take place before miss @entity28 gave birth after the hour - long ceremony , the couple climbed into a car to drive the short distance to @entity127 for their reception			1
@entity9 ’s choice of the @entity23 came as a surprise to local residents who had no idea why he had chosen the island			1
but bride @entity28 , a theatre and opera director , is thought to be distantly related to the first lord @entity58			0
@entity9 ’s hopes to keep the ceremony entirely secret were foiled when marquees began to appear in the grounds of the manor and road closure signs were erected close to the church			2
the star is believed to have spent friday night at the @entity145 in @entity146 on the island			0
that evening , he joined 140 guests for a party there			0

’ another added : ‘ so if everyone is camped out at @entity58 church to gatecrash the celeb wedding , does that mean @entity184 ’s will be nice and quiet ? ’ there had been speculation that @entity102 , who plays dr @entity107 to @entity9 ’s @entity10 , may have been best man			1
but @entity102 ’s partner @entity187 said such rumours were ‘ bowel - shatteringly , mind - numbingly wrong ’			2
@entity9 is also a frontrunner to take the @entity191 at next weekend ’s @entity192 , thanks to his acclaimed performance as the gay @entity196 codebreaker @entity195 in @entity197			2
spotted : the pair were first seen watching the @entity200 tennis together in @entity201 in june tying the knot : news of the wedding comes just three months after their engagement was announced in @entity207 section of the @entity209 newspaper on november 5			0
