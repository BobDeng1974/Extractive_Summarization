by @entity0 in the course of nearly half a century it has become one of the most familiar sounds on radio			0
but old age has finally caught up with the whistle that calls time on contestants in @entity10 ’s @entity9			1
the ‘ pea ’ which has provided the shrill for 826 episodes of the award - winning panel game is so ancient , it has made the whistle unreliable			1
louder : the new @entity20 whistle , left , the same kind used by football referees , and the original that raises the almost unthinkable prospect that panellists could be left blathering on for critical seconds , even after successfully completing the challenge to speak for a minute on specially chosen subjects ‘ without repetition , hesitation or deviation ’			1
but yesterday a @entity10 whistleblower revealed to the @entity34 that help is at hand			0
production assistant @entity36 , currently in charge of blowing the whistle at the end of each minute , confirms she has been given a new one – an @entity20 of the kind used by referees			1
it ’s so loud she fears the consequences when she blows it for the first time beside veteran presenter @entity46 , who will be 91 this year			2
' i do n’t want to startle him , ’ she said			0
‘ the other week i did manage to blow the old whistle really well and it made him jump out of his seat			2
’ ' i do n't want to startle @entity46 ' : the new whistle so loud whistleblower @entity36 fears the consequences when she blows it for the first time beside veteran presenter @entity46 , who will be 91 this year @entity36 was recruited as a whistleblower in 2007 , and has probably blown it around 500 of the estimated 8,000 times it has been heard since mr @entity46 chaired the first episode in 1967			1
‘ he tells listeners that whistleblowers need big breaths , ’ says @entity36			0
‘ however people who follow the show tell me i have “ a unique style ” – which mainly means i do n’t blow it hard enough			0
’ yesterday , mr @entity46 declared he was delighted a replacement had been found , adding : ‘ the whistle was very antiquated – i think they got it out of an old trunk somewhere , and it was somewhat unreliable			2
' i hope listeners will look forward to hearing the new one			0
