by @entity0 published : 06:41 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 20:54 est , 5 march 2013 a pub landlady who underwent a gastric bypass operation has become so thin she must eat a mountain of food every day to stay alive			1
a rare complication of the slimming surgery caused @entity8 ’s body to stop absorbing the nutrients it needs			1
in 12 months , her weight plummeted from 20st 7lbs to a skeletal 6st – and she ended up in hospital dangerously malnourished and close to death			1
her daily menu includes half a block of cheese , a packet of smoked salmon , a packet of biscuits , nuts , fruit , cake , a curry or shepherd ’s pie for dinner and bags of sweets			0
miss @entity8 , 51 , of @entity49 , @entity50 , said : ‘ it ’s a full - time job			1
our food bill is phenomenal			0
it must cost about £ 200 to feed me a week			0
‘ it was enjoyable at first but now it ’s a pain and i hate it			0
even if i do n’t feel like it i still really need to eat			1
’ ms @entity8 , 51 , decided to have weight loss surgery after her weight crept up to 20st 7lb malnourished : ms @entity8 's weight plummeted to 6st after surgery and she had to be fed through a tube in 2010 , miss @entity8 paid £ 10,000 to have the biliopancreatic diversion with a duodenal switch operation at the private @entity64 in @entity49			1
in this type of weight - loss surgery a large part of the stomach is removed and the small intestine re-routed			1
the object is to reduce the amount of time the body has to capture calories and absorb fat			2
following the operation , her weight dropped so quickly that her sister @entity77 , 50 , was inspired to have the same procedure			2
but while the sister ’s weight levelled off at 10st , miss @entity8 ’s continued to drop at an alarming rate			1
she said : ‘ it was an absolutely awful time			0
in the pub , people looked at me and thought , “ she is not going to make it ”			0
then and now : she says she now eats far more than when she was overweight ‘ my face was like a skeleton and it was totally sunken in			0
there was n’t an ounce of flesh on me			0
’ she was so malnourished she developed @entity92 , normally seen in alcoholics , people with @entity95 or those who have been starved , leaving her with memory loss and balance problems			1
breakfast : three cups of coffee with milk two egg omelette with 175g of cheese ( around about half a block ) two yoghurts bowl of crunchy nut cornflakes dinner : @entity108 curry with rice , roast dinner , shepherd 's pie snacks throughout the day : a whole packet of parma ham or smoked salmon chicken liver parfait on toast cheese and biscuits 100g of cashew nuts biscuits and chocolate lots of fruit water , milk and @entity128 bags of sweets , especially jelly beans and fruit pastels a huge piece of cake in the middle of the night miss @entity8 added : ‘ looking at pictures of myself is like looking at a picture of an @entity139 child that is starving			1
‘ i went into hospital to lose weight and i came out as a different person			2
’ miss @entity8 underwent two more operations last year to increase her stomach size to aid the intake of nutrients , but nothing else can be done to maintain a healthy weight apart from eating			1
she is now a healthy eight stone but has to continue to eat as much as she can to ensure she continues to gain weight			1
' to combat the illness , i need to absorb as much as i can from food , ' she said			2
' for example , whereas a normal person would consume about 30 - 40g of protein a day , i need to take 125g in to get my levels up to where they should be			2
' it has completely changed me as a person			0
' at the beginning i was really happy , because i was dropping lots of weight			2
' but then it 's supposed to stop and it just did n't			0
' there was no light at the end of the tunnel - it was an absolutely awful time			0
now , thanks to her huge calorie intake , she has managed to prevent her condition from worsening .			0
