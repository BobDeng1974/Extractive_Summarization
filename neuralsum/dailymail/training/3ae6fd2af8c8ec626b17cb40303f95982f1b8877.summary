by @entity0 a @entity2 appeals court judge has ruled that an insurer is not liable for damages that occurred to an apartment after a neighbor 's dead body ' exploded			1
' @entity8 battled @entity9 for almost six years , arguing that the insurer of her @entity12 condo should pay for the clean - up of her apartment			1
she argued that the @entity15 left the neighbor 's corpse so long that the body 's fluid leaked into her apartment			1
' putrid effluvia ' : @entity8 's apartment was damaged by her neighbor 's corpse , which rotted , undiscovered , for two weeks before ' exploding ' @entity24 's civil lawsuit against @entity9 stated that ' another unit owner 's body exploded thereby causing blood and bodily fluids to go into the adjoining condominium and the unit owned by @entity8			1
' the neighbor 's body was discovered an estimated two weeks after her death after a foul odor filled the adjacent units			1
the elderly woman 's puppy had been feeding on the corpse , according to the @entity39			0
the body was so decayed that gases caused the abdomen to bloat and eventually burst , releasing fluids			0
' i do n't know how the dog stayed alive			0
it must have been at her for some time , ' neighbor @entity46 told @entity49 in 2009			0
@entity9 offered @entity24 a sum for the clean - up , but she refused it , seeking full coverage			2
she argued that her policy covered personal property damage , including ' explosions			0
' not covered : the judge ruled that the neighbors body bursting during decomposition does not constitute an explosion @entity9 argued that a decomposing body does not constitute an explosion - and judge @entity63 agreed			1
' rather than stretching common sense , the trial court correctly gave the term " explosion " its " plain and unambiguous meaning as understood by the man on the street , " ' may wrote			0
' the plain meaning of the term " explosion " does not include a decomposing body 's cells explosively expanding , causing leakage of bodily fluids			2
' may wrote that @entity79 's attempt to prove the body exploded was ' novel ' but ultimately ruled against her .			2

@entity8 fought insurer @entity9 for almost six years for damages after her neighbor 's corpse ' exploded '
the body was left for so long , argued @entity24 , that the abdomen burst , leaking foul fluid and gas into her apartment
the body belonged to an elderly neighbor whose dog feasted on what remained of her body
@entity24 is covered for ' explosions ' , but @entity9 argued a decomposing body is not an explosion
a judge agreed and ruled against @entity24
