@entity1 ’s miserable stint at @entity2 hit a new low on tuesday night when he was dumped into the reserves by manager @entity5			1
@entity1 has not played a minute for @entity2 ’s first team since being dragged off in the home win over @entity8 last month and was left on the bench as @entity11 ’s team were knocked out of the @entity12 by @entity13 on monday night			1
now the £ 250,000 - a - week loan signing from @entity15 has suffered the indignity of being made to play in the @entity17 against @entity18			0
he did n’t score and was taken off as it ended 1 - 1			0
@entity1 was humiliated by being dumped in @entity2 's under 21s team on tuesday night @entity5 could be waving goodbye to @entity1 in the summer after dropping him to the reserves the @entity26 striker ’s demotion underlines @entity11 ’s concern over his fitness			1
the @entity2 manager usually asks senior players to play at this level only if they are on their way back from injury			1
@entity1 has been injury - free since recovering from a thigh strain in november and is unlikely to be pleased at being asked to drop down a level when he is desperate to prove he is worth a permanent deal			2
@entity1 did not manage to get on the scoresheet against @entity18 's under 21s and was poor the £ 250,000 - a - week loanee tries to escape from @entity18 's @entity41 ( left ) and @entity42 ( right ) having scored only four times in six months , @entity1 ’s chances of being retained in the summer are almost nil			0
but he feels he has not always been given a fair crack of the whip by @entity11			0
@entity47 reported earlier this year that the 29 - year - old feels he has to work twice as hard to impress @entity11 than other players			0
@entity11 ( back , left ) did not bring on @entity1 ( middle , second right ) in monday night 's @entity12 defeat to @entity13			2

@entity1 played in the @entity2 under 21 side on tuesday
manager @entity5 dumped @entity1 after his recent *performances*
@entity11 *rarely* does that apart from for players coming back from injury
but @entity1 has not been injured and is almost certain to leave in summer
