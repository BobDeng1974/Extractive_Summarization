@entity2 star @entity1 's chances of winning bail appeared to increase dramatically today after an embarrassing series of blunders and confusion in the prosecution case			1
just hours after the police officer leading the murder hunt told the athlete 's bail hearing in @entity13 that the performance enhancing drug testosterone and steroids had been found at his mansion home shortly after the killing of girlfriend @entity19 , prosecutors changed their story			1
in a humiliating u-turn , a spokesman for @entity23 's @entity22 said there had been an error in the evidence of detective warrant officer @entity28 when he identified the substance found in the 26 year - old 's bedroom			1
he then said it was testosterone but prosecution later admitted the drugs have not yet been tested @entity44 said it is too early to identify the substance as it is still undergoing laboratory tests			1
in fact , no results of any forensic tests from the scene of the killing had been given to investigators			0
there had been gasps in court when @entity56 , a policeman for 24 years and the first officer to arrive at the @entity1 house on @entity60 following the shooting of the 29 year - old model and law graduate , and prosecutors claimed testosterone had been found together with needles			1
discovery of the sports drug could potentially have brought questions over the star 's achievements at @entity72 where he became the first athlete to compete at an @entity74 and @entity2 , winning two gold medals and a silver			2
at one stage , the detective supposedly providing the key facts to keep @entity1 in custody had agreed with the defence lawyer that police had no evidence challenging the runner 's claim he accidently killed his girlfriend in a bathroom , believing it was an intruder			1
police accuse @entity23 's most famous sportsman of premeditated murder , a charge he emphatically denies			2
damning : the first half of the hearing saw damning allegations surface , but after a recess his defence team fired tough questions at the main witness , chief investigative officer @entity28 @entity56 left prosecutors rubbing their temples , only able to look down at their notes as he misjudged distances and acknowledged a bungling forensics team left in the bathroom toilet bowl one of the bullets fired at @entity109			1
the second day of the bail hearing in a case that has riveted @entity23 and much of the world appeared at first to go against the double - amputee runner , with prosecutors saying a witness can testify to hearing ' non-stop talking , like shouting ' between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. before the predawn shooting on february 14			1
however , @entity56 later said under cross examination that the person who overheard the argument was in a house 600 metres away in @entity1 's gated community in the suburbs of @entity23 's capital , @entity13			1
later , prosecutor @entity124 questioned the detective and acknowledged the distance was much closer			0
but confusion reigned for much of his testimony when at one point @entity56 said officers found syringes and steroids in @entity1 ' bedroom			2
mr @entity124 quickly cut the officer off and said the drugs were actually testosterone			2
defence lawyer , @entity138 , asserted when questioning the detective that it was not a banned substance and that police were trying to give the discovery a ' negative connotation			0
' ' it is an herbal remedy , ' mr @entity138 said			0
' it is not a steroid and it is not a banned substance			0
' @entity56 had claimed examination of the model 's body and the bathroom door @entity1 fired through suggested he had been had been wearing his prosthetic legs - directly contradicting the athlete 's claims that he was on his stumps and fired believing an intruder had broken in			1
' i believe that he knew that @entity19 was in the bathroom and he shot four shots through the door , ' the detective told the court			2
@entity1 broke down in tears during the second day of the bail hearing as mr @entity28 outlined the forensic evidence detective @entity28 said he believed the bullets were fired down suggesting @entity1 was wearing his prosthetic legs when the shots were discharged as details were released from miss @entity19 's post mortem showing bullets hit the right side of her head , her hip and right elbow - resulting in a broken arm , @entity1 lent forward sobbing and muttered prayers , the muscles straining on his neck			1
in apparently damning evidence aimed at countering the athlete 's case for bail , @entity56 said he viewed the man who won two gold medals and a silver at @entity72 as a ' flight risk ' pointing out he had not used any of the four telephones found at the house to call police and claiming his family had been searching for a memory stick containing details of off - shore bank accounts			1
but amid confusion , mr @entity138 began to pick holes in the prosecution case with the officer forced to acknowledge that the witness who allegedly overheard the argument was 600 metres from @entity1 ' house at the @entity207 complex on the outskirts of @entity13			1
he later changed this to 300 metres			0
police ' take every piece of evidence and try to extract the most possibly negative connotation and present it to the court , ' mr @entity138 told magistrate @entity215			0
@entity1 's brother @entity216 said after the hearing that he ' trusts everyone has more clarity about this tragic incident ' there was even laughter in the court during an exchange between mr @entity215 and @entity56 with the magistrate asking the officer about his belief that if granted bail , @entity1 would flee @entity23			1
addressing @entity56 and prosecutor @entity124 , mr @entity215 said : ' the accused before court is an international athlete , paralympic athlete , he uses prosthesis on both legs			0
' i 'm sure we would both agree that his face is widely recognised internationally			0
do you subjectively believe that he would take the opportunity , being who he is , using prosthesics to get around , to flee @entity23 ? ' @entity56 responded : ' yes			1
' security in the court stopped the laughter in the court			0
the magistrate raises his eyebrows			0
@entity56 protested : ' i believe for someone facing 15 years to life , i would make a plan to get out and go somewhere , with the finances he has			0
' bathroom plan : a projector was used to beam the plans up for the public and press to see mr @entity215 said : ' and if he were to flee , he may opt for a country with no extradition agreement with @entity23 ? ' ' it 's possible , ' the officer replied			1
mr @entity215 pressed him : ' but do you think it 's possible that a person who has won @entity74 golds would want to forsake his career when he has a chance to prove his innocence in a court of law ? ' ' your honour , imprisonment is no joke , ' the officer said			2
the exchanges appeared to lift the spirits and hopes of the @entity1 family sitting in court that the bail application might be successful , their dark mood during the initial stages of prosecution evidence changing to one of relief and smiles as they left court			1
earlier , mr @entity124 said the killing was premeditated because @entity1 took time to put on his prosthetic legs before the shooting			0
scene of horror : this is the toilet cubicle where @entity19 was found ' slumped over but alive ' after being shot three times through the locked door he projected a plan of the bedroom and bathroom for the courtroom and argued @entity1 had to walk past his bed to get to the bathroom and could not have done so without realizing the @entity109 was not in the bed as he claimed			1
' there 's no other way of getting there , ' mr @entity124 said			0
@entity56 said the holster for the 9mm pistol was found under the side of the bed on which @entity19 slept - also implying it would have been impossible for @entity1 to get the gun without realizing that @entity109 was not in the bed and could have been the person in the bathroom @entity56 said he wanted @entity1 charged additionally with a weapons violation after unlicensed .38 calibre ammunition was found at the house			1
mr @entity138 asked the officer if miss @entity19 's body - she was wearing white shorts and a black vest - showed ' any pattern of defensive wounds , ' and the detective said it did not			2
@entity56 said the shots were fired from five feet , and that police found three spent cartridges in the bathroom and one in the hallway connecting the bathroom to the bedroom			2
he admitted police had initially missed finding one cartridge			0
the hearing at @entity328 is due to resume at 11am local time tomorrow morning - it was initially expected to last for two days police also found two iphones in the bathroom and two blackberrys in the bedroom , he said , adding that none had been used to phone for help			0
@entity1 had said that he called the manager of his guarded and gated housing complex and a private paramedic service			0
mr @entity138 countered @entity1 did make calls , including to the guards of the housing estate			0
in one case , he said , a guard could hear @entity1 crying			0
' was it part of his premeditated plan , not to switch off the phone and cry ? ' mr @entity138 asked sarcastically			0
screaming heard coming from the house was @entity1 calling for help from his balcony , not @entity109 , the lawyer said			2
leaving court , the athlete 's brother @entity354 said : ' i feel like the court proceedings went well			2
we trust that everyone has more clarity about this tragic incident			0
' @entity363 arrives at court two hours early for second day of bail hearing			1

investigating officer says boxes of ' testosterone and needles ' found
but prosecution later forced to admit tests not yet carried out on drugs
one of series of errors made on second day of @entity1 's bail hearing
@entity380 says witness heard shouting and shots being fired on the same night @entity19 was killed
but warrant officer @entity28 says witness lives *600metres* away
*prompts* laughter in court by saying world famous athlete could be a ' flight risk ' and try to flee @entity23 if he was granted bail
