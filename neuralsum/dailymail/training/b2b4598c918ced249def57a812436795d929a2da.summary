scientists have discovered a simulated version of the elusive ' @entity3 particle ' using superconductors			1
the @entity5 , which is believed to be responsible for all the mass in the universe , was discovered in 2012 using a @entity9 's supercollider			1
the superconductor experiment suggests that the @entity12 particle could be detected without the huge amounts of energy used at by the @entity15			1

in this image two high - energy photons collide			2
the yellow lines are the measured tracks of other particles produced in the collision , which helped lead to the discovery of the @entity3 particle the results could help scientists better understand how this mysterious particle – also known as the @entity5 – behaves in different conditions			1
' just as the @entity9 experiments revealed the existence of the @entity5 in a high - energy accelerator environment , we have now revealed a @entity12 boson analogue in superconductors , ' said researcher @entity34 from @entity35			1
superconductors are a type of metal that , when cooled to low temperatures , allow electrons to pass through freely			0
' the @entity12 mode was never actually observed in superconductors because of technical difficulties - difficulties that we 've managed to overcome , ' professor @entity34 said			0
the superconductor experiment suggests that the @entity12 particle could be detected without the huge amounts of energy used at by the @entity15 ( pictured ) the ' @entity5 ' , also known as the @entity5 , was a missing piece in the jigsaw for physicists in trying to understand how the universe works			1
scientists believe that a fraction of a second after the @entity57 that gave birth to the universe , an invisible energy field , called the @entity5 , formed			1
this has been described as a kind of ' cosmic treacle ' across the universe			2
as particles passed through it , they picked up mass , giving them size and shape and allowing them to form the atoms that make up you , everything around you and everything in the universe			2
this was the theory proposed in 1964 by former grammar school boy @entity12 that has now been confirmed			0
without the @entity12 field particles would simply whizz around space in the same way as light does			0
a boson is a type of sub-atomic particle			2
every energy field has a specific particle that governs its interaction with what 's around it			1
to try to pin it down , scientists at the @entity15 near @entity91 smashed together beams of protons – the ' hearts of atoms ' – at close to the speed of light , recreating conditions that existed a fraction of a second after the @entity57			1
although they would rapidly decay , they should have left a recognisable footprint			0
this footprint was found in 2012			2
the main difficulty was that the superconducting material would decay into something known as particle - hole pairs			0
large amounts of energy – which are usually needed to excite the @entity12 mode - tend to break apart the electron pairs that act as the material 's charge			1
professor @entity34 and his colleagues solved this problem by using ultra-thin superconducting films of @entity115 ( @entity116 ) and @entity117 ( @entity118 ) as something known as the ' superconductor - insulator critical point			0
' this is a state in which recent theory predicted the decay of the @entity12 would no longer occur			0
in this way , they could still excite a @entity12 mode even at relatively low energies			0
' the parallel phenomenon in superconductors occurs on a different energy scale entirely - just one - thousandth of a single electronvolt , ' professor @entity34 added			0
' what 's exciting is to see how , even in these highly disparate systems , the same fundamental physics is at work			0
' the different approach help solve one of the longstanding mysteries of fundamental physics			0
the discovery of the @entity5 verified the @entity142 , which predicted that particles gain mass by passing through a field that slows down their movement through the vacuum of space			1
to try to pin it down , scientists at the @entity15 near @entity91 smashed together beams of protons – the ' hearts of atoms ' – at close to the speed of light , recreating conditions that existed a fraction of a second after the @entity57			1
although they would rapidly decay , the also left a recognisable footprint			0
professor @entity12 , 83 , has been waiting since 1964 for science to catch up with his ideas about the @entity5 according to professor @entity34 , observation of the @entity164 in superconductors is significant because it reveals how a single type of physical process behaves under different energy conditions			2
' exciting the @entity12 mode in a particle accelerator requires enormous energy levels - measured in giga - electronvolts , or 109 @entity173 , ' professor @entity34 says			2

' what 's exciting is to see how , even in these highly disparate systems , the same fundamental physics is at work			0
' the @entity15 is due to come back online in march after an upgrade that has given it a big boost in energy			1
' with this new energy level , the ( collider ) will open new horizons for physics and for future discoveries , ' @entity9 director general @entity187 said in a statement			2
' i 'm looking forward to seeing what nature has in store for us			0
' @entity9 's collider is buried in a 27 - km ( 17 - mile ) tunnel straddling the @entity202 - @entity201 border at the foot of the @entity205 mountains			1
the @entity15 in @entity91 will come back online in march after an upgrade that has given it a big boost in energy			1

@entity5 is believed to be responsible for all the mass in the universe
particle was discovered in 2012 using a @entity9 's supercollider in @entity91
superconductor experiment suggests the particle could be detected without the huge amounts of energy used at by the @entity15
@entity15 is due to come back online next month after an upgrade that has given it a big boost in energy
