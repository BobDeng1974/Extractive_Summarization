by @entity0 published : 18:35 est , 24 may 2012 updated : 11:09 est , 25 may 2012 defeat : @entity1 described stories referring to her sexuality published after her secret affair with the @entity5 became public as ' highly unpleasant and hurtful ' @entity8 ’s lover had only herself to blame for a series of newspaper articles she claimed provoked a ‘ cataclysmic interference ’ with her private life , a high court judge ruled yesterday			1
@entity1 described stories referring to her sexuality published after her secret affair with the @entity5 became public as ‘ highly unpleasant and hurtful ’			1
but mr justice @entity14 threw out her claim for damages against the @entity17 and @entity18 , leaving her with estimated legal costs of £ 410,000 , and in a damning judgment accused her of seriously exaggerating some of her evidence			1
describing her as not a ‘ good or reliable witness ’ , he added : ‘ one reason for my reluctance to accept ms @entity1 ’s evidence is the poor view i have formed of her candour , given all the circumstances of this case			1
’ miss @entity1 , 44 , went to court over what she said were ‘ crude and demeaning stereotypes ’ about her bisexuality and sued @entity33 , publishers of the @entity17 newspapers , for alleged misuse of private information and harassment in 65 articles			1
but the judge said she was ‘ not the purely private figure she claims to be ’ because of her involvement with mr @entity8 ‘ both professionally , as his press agent , and personally , as his secret mistress , in circumstances where he campaigned with a leaflet to the electorate of @entity52 ( his @entity54 constituency ) about how much he valued his family ’			1
ordering her to pay @entity33 ’s legal costs and refusing her leave to appeal , he added : ‘ ms @entity1 has shown little sign of recognising how what she herself has done has given rise to the publicity she finds so unwelcome			1
‘ the difficult situation she found herself in was of her own making			0
’ rejecting all her claims , he said : ‘ i do not accept the first premise of ms @entity1 ’s case , namely that she is a private individual			1
‘ there are two reasons			0
first , in her professional capacity , she undertook to work for one of the leading politicians in the country in the capacity of press officer			0
‘ secondly , in her private capacity , she conducted a sexual relationship with mr @entity8 which he told her would lead to him leaving his wife			1
‘ she did this in conditions of secrecy which she knew were likely to give rise to publicity , or in other words , to a political scandal			0
‘ the scandal may or may not be bigger than she ( or mr @entity8 ) had foreseen , but there was always likely to be a scandal			2
‘ the public has an interest in knowing how the personal life of a leading politician , especially a cabinet minister , is likely to affect , or has affected , the business of government			0
so ms @entity1 in her private capacity chose to take the risk of being mixed up in a political scandal , which her own conduct precipitated			1
’ the judge also warned : ‘ @entity103 report the break - up through adultery of the marriage of a cabinet minister , a court should be slow to decide that information about the other woman which is included in the articles is irrelevant			0
’ mr @entity8 left his wife of 26 years , @entity111 , for miss @entity1 soon after she became his press officer during the 2010 general election			1
it followed a two - year affair , which he kept secret from @entity117 and miss @entity1 kept secret from her civil partner , @entity119			1
the judge heard that because her husband ’s press aide was in a same - sex relationship , miss @entity1 was the last woman @entity117 might have suspected he would run off with			0
during a five - day hearing last month miss @entity1 , a former political journalist , admitted giving newspapers tips about the sex lives of @entity129 stars and senior politicians , selling a diary item to the @entity18 about the current deputy prime minister , which she described as ‘ @entity134 18 shags story ’			1
mr @entity14 , in a withering 136 - page judgment , totally rejected her case			1
he said he was not persuaded @entity139 ‘ was being candid ’ when she initially said she had sold stories only to the @entity141 and claimed to have forgotten the other newspapers and what the stories were about			1
dismissed : mp @entity8 's partner @entity1 has lost her privacy and harassment claim against @entity33 , which publishes the @entity17 a high court judge told ms @entity1 , pictured left today and right at the @entity148 last september , that she was in a situation ' of her own making ' he said her words , the ‘ @entity134 18 shags story ’ , on her invoice supported the view that she was ‘ a journalist with a robust personality			1
a person who saw nothing wrong in disclosing to the world at large what she considered to be newsworthy information about the sexual activities of others			0
‘ that was so even if ( or especially if ) that information had previously been known only to a small number of people			0
‘ likewise , she saw nothing wrong in disclosing to the newspapers information conveyed to her in or from a private conversation			0
’ the judge singled out evidence given by mail columnist @entity173 , whom miss @entity1 accused of inaccurate reporting			2
he said : ‘ i found mr @entity173 to be a candid and reliable witness			0
‘ given the assessment that i have made of the evidence of ms @entity1 , i have no hesitation in preferring the evidence of mr @entity173 where it conflicts with that of ms @entity1			1
’ columnist @entity182 and other mail journalists gave evidence during the hearing and the judge said : ‘ i have no reason to doubt that all of the defendant ’s witnesses were giving their evidence truthfully			0
‘ it follows from this and from the view that i formed of ms @entity1 ’s evidence			2
that where her evidence conflicts with theirs , as it does in the case of mr @entity173 in particular , i reject ms @entity1 ’s evidence			2
’ he was also critical of miss @entity1 ’s unfounded allegations that a journalist had stolen a photograph of her civil partnership ceremony			2
‘ this is a regrettable part of her evidence , ’ said the judge			0
mr @entity14 said what the @entity17 wrote was insulting and offensive in so far as it referred to her personal clothing and appearance			1
but the words ‘ bisexual ’ and ‘ lesbian ’ are factual words which are not normally to be understood as pejorative by a reasonable person			0
‘ what the defendant has expressed hostility to is not her sexuality but her conduct			0
‘ it would be a serious interference with freedom of expression if those wishing to express their own views could be silenced by , or threatened with , claims for harassment based on subjective claims by individuals that they feel offended or insulted			0
’ rejecting her claims that the 65 articles amounted to harassment , the judge pointed out : ‘ each time the defendant has named ms @entity1 it has done so in a story in which the main character is mr @entity8			1
‘ and each publication has been prompted by a particular event in mr @entity8 ’s public career or life , or some other newsworthy event , such as a party conference			2
‘ the main target of the articles complained of is mr @entity8			0
‘ ms @entity1 is named in them only because of the very important secondary role she played in events relating to mr @entity8			1
’ on her claim for misuse of private information regarding miss @entity1 ’s sexuality , he said : ‘ it is her own evidence , as well as the evidence of the journalists , that even before the revelation of her affair with mr @entity8 in june 2010 she had had relationships with other men , and those who knew her knew of her sexuality			1
she did not attempt to keep it private			0
‘ the submission that in these circumstances ms @entity1 had a reasonable expectation of privacy as to her being bisexual seems to me to be unarguable			2
’ the judge added : ‘ it is important that i stress that i have not reached any conclusion about the conduct of mr @entity8 in relation to any of the matters referred to in this judgment			2
‘ he is not a party to this action , and he has not given evidence			0
‘ it would be wrong for the court , or for any reader of this judgment , to draw any inference adverse to mr @entity8 in a case where he has not given evidence and not been represented			0
’ a spokesman for @entity33 said : ‘ this was an important example of the @entity103 exercising its right to free speech in relation to matters of significant public interest			2
‘ we are pleased that the court agreed with us and has today dismissed all of miss @entity1 ’s complaints			2
‘ the references to miss @entity1 ’s sexuality in our coverage were never pejorative , private or in any way homophobic			1
‘ miss @entity1 chose to level some very serious charges against our journalists in this case			2
this judgment vindicates both our journalists and their journalism			0
’ outside court @entity139 said she thought the ruling was ‘ confused and wrong , ’ adding : ‘ i am extremely disappointed by this judgment			0

@entity1 described stories referring to her sexuality published after her secret affair became public as ‘ highly unpleasant and hurtful ’
mr @entity14 threw out her claim for damages against the @entity17 and @entity18 , leaving her with estimated legal costs of £ 410,000
@entity322 said she was ‘ not the purely private figure she claims to be '
