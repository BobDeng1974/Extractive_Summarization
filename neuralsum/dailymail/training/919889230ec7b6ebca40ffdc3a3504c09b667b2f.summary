@entity13 , based in @entity14 , @entity15 , has closed its @entity5 chapter after several incidents , including the february noose tying			1
the names of the three students , all from @entity21 , have n't been released			0
the @entity23 school was all - white until the 1962 enrollment of eventual civil rights icon @entity25 broke down the walls of segregation and set off violent protests that left two dead and several injured			2
action taken : @entity13 members who reportedly hung a noose around the @entity25 statue on the campus of the @entity5 earlier this year have caused the group to be shuttered fraternity members are also accused of draping of a pre- 2003 @entity21 state flag with a @entity39 battle emblem in its design on the face of the statue in the pre-dawn hours of feb. 16			1
the fraternity booted the students from it 's ranks and had been suspended while under review by the national office , but its ultimate fate has now been decided			2
' the decision is not a result of any individual incident , but a response to newly discovered , ongoing behavior that includes incidents of hazing , underage drinking , alcohol abuse , and failure to comply with the university and fraternity 's codes of conduct , ' the fraternity said in a statement released to @entity64			1
' though the incident involving the @entity25 statue several months ago did not directly result in the chapter 's closure , it did mark the beginning of an intensified period of review			0
' @entity72 : @entity25 , the first black student to integrate the @entity5 in 1962 , speaking to an audience at a 2012 book reading , has not publicly spoken about the incident a race problem : a current student says students at the school are culturally insensitive home base : the @entity13 fraternity house on the campus of the @entity5 - it will be taken over by the school after this semester @entity5 student @entity84 told @entity64 that he believes ' @entity5 has a race problem , ' but it is n't just limited to his school			1
' universities across the @entity89 are just more prone to these kind of incidents because of the past history at the [ schools ] , ' he said			0
' the school has been dealing with race issues since @entity97 € ™ s admission , and has been prone to isolated incidents because of its history			2
' he insisted @entity5 is taking steps to mitigate such future incidents , but could not say what is being done outside of sensitivity training to this fall 's incoming freshmen			2
a 2013 on - campus performance of ' @entity108 , ' a play about the 1998 murder of openly gay @entity112 student @entity111 were met with football players shouting derogatory comments at the stage			1
students also openly chanted racial slurs to protest president @entity119 's reelection in 2012			0
@entity5 only ditched its @entity121 mascot - which evoked strong imagery of the civil war - for a black bear in 2010			0
@entity39 flags were only banned from football games in 2003			0
@entity127 : students jeered at @entity25 in 1962 as he walked the @entity5 campus with armed guards race riots : @entity133 troops patrolled the streets of @entity135 , @entity136 , where the school is located , during riots after @entity141 's enrollment costly : burned out cars and debris were littered about the campus after the riots a different world : an effigy of @entity25 hangs at right during the riots			1
@entity141 ( right ) holds a newspaper as he attempts to register university disciplinary proceedings against the three students are ongoing			2
according to a school spokesperson , the @entity153 is also investigating			0
the @entity156 district attorney has said state charges wo n't be brought because no state laws were broken			1
@entity136 's hate crime law requires an underlying crime for those additional charges			1
because the statue itself was n't marred or broken , prosecutors say typical vandalism charges do n't apply			2
after the noose was found , the university asked the national headquarters to review the 130 - member chapter , which had been on campus since 1987			1
' the closure is not a result of what happened with the @entity141 statue , but the @entity141 statue precipitated the intensive review of how they conduct business , ' the fraternity added			0
controversial : @entity182 mascot , col. @entity121 , shown during a 2003 @entity184 game , was replaced in 2010 by a bear @entity5 officials said the national office had previously intervened in 2010 to fix similar problems			0
' we are disappointed that a pattern of bad behavior and serious , inexcusable hazing occurred within the chapter , ' @entity190 @entity189 said in a statement			0
' periodic reports from and meetings with local alumni and national headquarters led us to believe that the chapter was improving			0
' @entity13 ceo @entity202 said in a statement the organization had ' no choice ' but to close the unit			2
' though it 's always painful to close a chapter , these students ' actions clearly illustrate a determination to perpetuate an experience based on risky and unconstructive behavior			0
' @entity214 said students currently living in the @entity13 house on campus would be allowed to stay and eat meals there through the end of the semester , but would not be allowed to have any social activities			1
after that , the university , which owns the land under the house , and the fraternity would discuss uses for the structure			0
@entity13 officials said they would discuss a return to campus with the university			1
it 's not clear how long that might take			0
@entity214 said that several years ago , the university did not reinstate the closed chapter of another fraternity until all the members at the time of the closure had graduated			1

the @entity13 fraternity has closed but not ruled out returning to campus in the future
the noose incident is one of many racially - charged events that have occurred on campus
a student admitted that the university has a race problem but insisted it was not limited just to his school
the students are not likely to face any hate crime charges after authorities said no laws were broken by the hateful act
