this amazing series of pictures captures the famous @entity3 display team while they fly above @entity5 in @entity6			1
the selfie - style shots show the squadron forming up just feet from the wings of their fellow pilot as they practice their performance			0
the pilots â€™ routines see them fly at speeds of up to 600 miles an hour , swooping as low as 100 feet and pulling up to @entity15 during the @entity17 manoeuvre			2
in @entity19 everything weighs 8 times more , and so it can be difficult for photographers to capture images as it is almost impossible to hold the camera up to eye level			2
the force will also drain blood away from the eyes and brain and into the legs , which can cause black out			0
these pictures were captured by expert @entity33 who is one of just ten air - to - air photographers in the world , and who has worked with the @entity3 on several occasions			1
these stunning pictures , captured by air - to - air photographer @entity33 show the @entity3 flying in formation above @entity5 in @entity6 the ' selfie ' style shots were captured from the cockpit of one of the arrows as his co-pilots form up just feet from the tips of his wings the @entity3 began training in 1964 and had their first display season in 1965			1
the red in their name comes from the fact that @entity54 training aircraft of the day were red , and the arrow references another famous display team , the @entity43 @entity33 is just one of ten licensed air - to - air photographers in the world and has worked with the @entity3 on several different occasions as the team perform their aerial acrobatics they will fly as low as 100 feet , pull up to @entity63 of force and travel at up to 600 miles an hour , all while coming within feet of each other 's aircraft at @entity69 , everything weighs eight times as much , making photography very difficult as it is almost impossible to keep hold a camera level with your eye the team 's new tail design , to mark 50 year since it began flying , can be seen in the pictures			1
the @entity79 - style design is the most significant change to the livery of the aircraft in the group 's history the @entity3 have always flown whichever aircraft is in service as the @entity54 's advanced fast jet trainer ; currently the @entity88 each of the nine @entity3 display pilots is chosen by a selection board and flies with the team for a three - year tour of duty the pilots wear special @entity97 suits in order to keep blood evenly distributed around the body			0
under that amount of pressure blood can drain away from a pilot 's head and brain , causing loss of vision and blackouts the vapour trails are created by pumping diesel fuel into the jet exhaust which heats to over 500 degrees @entity112			0
the diesel immediately vaporises creating a white cloud , with dye added to make it blue or red			0
