@entity1 will never have full control of its borders as long as we are part of the @entity6 , foreign secretary @entity0 admitted @entity1 can never have full control over national borders as long as we remain a member of the @entity6 , the foreign secretary has admitted			1
@entity0 warned the @entity1 people will vote to leave the @entity6 if we do not get reform			1
in a forthright interview , mr @entity0 said ‘ destabilising movements ’ across @entity16 in recent years had seen ‘ large waves of migrants ’ settling in @entity1 , putting pressure on public services			1
he said @entity19 should realise that if we do not get new powers to at least limit the number of migrants from the @entity24 , @entity1 voters will choose to leave the @entity6 in the 2017 referendum			1
‘ if your ambition is that we have total unfettered control of our own borders to do what we like , that is n’t compatible with membership of the @entity6 , it ’s as simple as that , ’ he said			1
‘ so if that ’s what you want , you ’re essentially talking about leaving the @entity6			2
‘ if what you want is the ability to avoid the kind of destabilising movements that we ’ve seen over the last decade or so – large waves of migrants settling in concentrations that puts pressure on public services , people coming in to take advantage of the benefits system , people coming here who are working but who are getting an unwarranted bonus out of our benefits system through things like child tax credits and so on – if that ’s what we want to deal with , i think there are ways we can agree to deal with these things with our partners in @entity16			2
’ mr @entity0 went further than @entity62 has gone in saying @entity1 will walk away from the negotiating table if other countries are not prepared to give us greater immigration powers			1
he also hinted that ministers may try to force the @entity6 to pay for extra school places needed by the rise in child immigrants , adding that the @entity71 will ' look at everything ' to relieve pressure on strained public services			1
the foreign secretary revealed he has already started talking to his counterparts among the other 27 member states to work out what their ‘ red lines ’ are , ahead of official renegotiation after the election			1
he said the talks had made him more optimistic that @entity1 could get enough powers back without wholesale reforms to @entity6 treaties			1
only 20 per cent of @entity1 believe @entity62 will be able to strike a deal with the @entity6 of border controls these treaties mandate freedom of movement , but mr @entity0 said the wording was more flexible than many countries think – and the freedom could be limited by ‘ stretching ’ the meaning of the treaties			1
last night , an opinion poll showed there is deep scepticism about whether mr @entity62 can deliver on his ambition to curb the free movement of @entity6 workers			2
@entity99 found that only 20 per cent think he can strike a deal that will allow the @entity1 to turn some @entity16 citizens away at its borders			1
the overwhelming majority , 73 per cent , are doubtful			2
mr @entity0 ’s intervention comes just after sir @entity105 warned that @entity1 is likely to leave the @entity6 unless it allows us to restrict immigration			1
sir @entity105 warned that @entity1 is likely to leave the @entity6 unless immigration can be restricted the former premier said the chances of @entity1 leaving the @entity6 were now ‘ just under 50 per cent ’ – and would grow unless @entity110 agreed to accommodate @entity1 concerns on freedom of movement			1
yesterday mr @entity62 , attending the @entity115 summit in @entity116 , said he agreed with sir @entity105 ’s ‘ excellent ’ speech about ‘ the need there is to address @entity1 ’s concerns about immigration inside the @entity6 ’			1
but the @entity123 received a blow last night when @entity126 foreign minister @entity125 said freedom of movement was a cornerstone of the @entity6 and unlikely to be reformed			1
but mr @entity0 , who has been on a tour of @entity16 capitals since taking the post in july , said : ‘ we ’re in the beginning stages of a negotiation			2
‘ i ’d like to be telling my @entity19 counterpart honestly if you draw the line there , i do n’t think we ’re going to get this past the @entity1 public in a referendum			1
but if you could move your line to there , i think we might			0
’ he said that if @entity1 does not get what voters want , the referendum result is likely to be a ‘ no ’			2
and the foreign secretary said @entity1 is floating the idea of an ‘ emergency brake ’ which could be applied to limit numbers if migration exceeded forecasts			1
he welcomed this week ’s @entity153 ruling saying member nations can refuse to pay certain benefits to jobless migrants			0
‘ i do n’t want to knee - jerk react , but it clearly means that because most of our benefits system is non-contributory , it gives us probably more scope than almost anybody else in @entity16 to look at how we apply the availability of benefits to @entity6 migrants , ’ mr @entity0 added			1
the foreign secretary said the court ’s ruling showed that movement from @entity110 on freedom of movement was possible			1
@entity173 gipsy @entity172 's refusal to work spurred a crackdown on benefits tourism wrapped up warm for a day out in town , this is the @entity173 gipsy whose refusal to work has spurred a crackdown on benefits tourism			0
@entity172 , 25 , has found herself at the centre of a landmark @entity16 case , which has apparently given @entity1 the green light to block welfare claims from migrants who refuse to work			2
but while the courts – and her own family – insist she must now get a job , @entity191 yesterday declared : ‘ it is unfair ’			0
the @entity196 tracked down @entity191 to a high street apartment in the @entity19 city of @entity199 , 120 miles south of @entity200			2
the newly married mother – whose husband is also unemployed – moved four years ago from @entity203 to @entity199 , where her sister @entity204 had already relocated with her husband and five children			0
@entity191 is a convicted criminal who has never worked a day in her life but has been given a state - funded flat and a range of benefits			0
the @entity16 ruling this week , however , means she can not claim welfare benefits intended for jobseekers because she has made no effort to find employment in @entity19			2
the judgment suggests the @entity1 can , similarly , refuse to pay welfare benefits to migrants who have moved to @entity1 simply to live off the state			1
@entity191 insists she does want to work and is unemployed only because she can not get a work permit			0
speaking as she waited for a tram into the centre of @entity199 , she told the @entity196 : ‘ i came here to babysit for my sister who has five children , but now the children are older i ’m not needed as a babysitter any more			0
i then tried to get a job , but was told i needed a work permit			0
i applied several times but i was never granted one			0
’ @entity191 completed just three years at school in @entity236 , a small town of 20,000 residents close to the @entity239 border in north - west @entity203			2
she has a five - year - old son , @entity240 , whose father is unknown			0
she has no professional training , has never worked , and was sentenced to two years on probation for petty theft while living in @entity203			0
despite living in @entity19 since november 2010 , she can speak only basic @entity19 and can barely read , write or do basic sums			2
her sister , @entity246 , said she was desperate for @entity191 to start supporting herself			0
‘ i wish my sister would get a job			0
i ca n’t bear the situation any more			0
’ the @entity153 ruled that national governments can limit access to jobless benefits @entity191 was apparently given a flat in central @entity199 for her , her husband and her son so she could move out of her sister ’s apartment			0
at the apartment in a smart block above a bank , @entity191 ’s husband said he did not understand what the fuss was about			0
the @entity16 ruling is seen as a boost to the @entity268 ’s welfare reforms and means @entity6 countries do not have to pay jobless @entity6 migrants who emigrate looking to live off state handouts			1
but critics say the case simply shows that not enough is being done to stop migrants emigrating for handouts – because @entity191 is still entitled to other benefits			0
@entity191 receives £ 145 a month in child benefit and £ 105 a month in ‘ maintenance ’ payments , which she will continue to get from the @entity221			0
she also applied for ‘ basic provision ’ benefits worth £ 300 a month to jobseekers			0
the local job centre refused this application so @entity191 appealed to a social court and the case was referred to @entity289			0
this week , the @entity16 court rejected her appeal , declaring that rights of free movement depend on migrants not being an ‘ unreasonable burden ’ to the host country .			0

foreign secretary admits @entity1 will never have border control in the @entity6
@entity0 warned that the @entity6 needs to reform or @entity1 will leave
@entity19 should realise @entity1 will leave unless we get new powers , he said
hinted that @entity6 may have to pay for school places taken by migrant children
only 20 per cent think the pm will be able to strike a deal with @entity6 *leaders*
