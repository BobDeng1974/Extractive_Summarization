by @entity0 @entity2 ’s free school meals plan was in disarray last night after it was savaged by headteachers			1
they blasted ‘ ludicrous ’ official advice that infants could be asked to choose their meals two hours ahead , eat at 11am and have cold lunches			1
the guidance from the @entity11 even says parents might be brought in to chop vegetables			0
@entity2 ' free school meals plan was in disarray after it was savaged by headteachers from september , all children between four and seven will qualify for free lunches under the £ 1billion scheme announced by the deputy prime minister at the @entity22 autumn conference			1
heads have already warned they do not have the facilities to cope			1
the guidance responds with positive case studies and the suggestion that schools make ‘ lunchtime part of the curriculum ’ and lengthen or stagger lunch breaks			0
but @entity32 , of the @entity33 , said : ‘ this policy was a nice soundbite and took us all by surprise – it just was n’t thought through properly			1
' one school that has been trialling this has had to start lunches at 11am and finish at 2pm – it ’s ridiculous			1
’ @entity42 , head of @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 , insisted the tips were worthless			0
‘ they are not addressing the problem that we have , which is lack of capacity , ’ he said			0
deputy prime minister @entity2 eating lunch with children from the @entity53 in @entity54			1
but heads have blasted ' ludicrous ' official advice that infants could be asked to choose their meals two hours ahead , eat at 11am and have cold lunches ‘ it ’s being done so badly the government could end up with a monumental own goal			1
the motivation is less about children ’s welfare and more about election promises			1
‘ how much of break time would be taken up getting children to pick what they want for lunch ? that frankly is a ludicrous solution			1
‘ has anyone from the @entity11 ever tried to get 60 four - year - olds to choose at break time what they want for lunch and to remember by the time they get up to the serving hatch – or not to change their mind when they see the food laid out in front of them ? ’ he also questioned advice suggesting that menus be simplified : ‘ the recipes are n’t complicated			1
we ’re not having chateaubriand			0
it ’s spaghetti bolognaise etc etc. i ’m not sure there ’s much mileage in that			0
’ mr @entity42 has asked his local authority for a share of £ 150million made available by the @entity94 to help schools improve kitchens and dining halls			0
but his likely allocation will be nowhere near enough to cover the renovations to kitchen and dining facilities he needs			1
he said the guidance showed the initiative could not be delivered without detrimental effects on other aspects of school life , such as @entity108			0
the guidance ‘ toolkit ’ suggests that schools ‘ set aside extra time to help children learn how to use cutlery as part of their curriculum ’			2
from september , all children between four and seven will qualify for free lunches under the £ 1billion scheme announced by the deputy prime minister at the @entity22 autumn conference it highlights a school where pupils are taught about the food they are eating , encouraged to eat more fruit and vegetables and shown how to use knives and forks			1
further case studies include a primary that relies on parent volunteers to ‘ prepare vegetables and bake cakes for its in - house lunch service ’			2
the toolkit notes that putting up ‘ brightly coloured posters ’ will improve the dining hall environment			0
it also tells heads to control noise levels by playing music , rewarding quiet pupils or supervising children more closely			1
mr @entity2 ’s initial hope that all 1.5million meals would be hot has been abandoned , with the @entity11 confirming schools will able to provide cold lunches as long as they meet nutritional standards			2
for schools with too many children to feed in an hour , the advice is to ‘ lengthen or stagger lunch breaks ’			2
the toolkit , written with an introduction by @entity22 schools minister @entity159 , notes that schools which took part in a free meals trial scheme found they ‘ could get it right after a few weeks ’ by being flexible about how they organised their lunch hours			1
at @entity167 in @entity168 , @entity169 , there is no kitchen and all pupils eat packed lunches in their classrooms			2
head @entity174 said : ‘ the status quo here works extremely well			0
i can see a situation where millions of pounds will have gone into this but that money will be squandered			0
’ @entity180 , @entity181 chairman of the @entity182 , said the free meals policy should have been thought through more carefully			1
‘ it does show the dangers of @entity2 pitching into education policy without being aware of the realities in schools , ’ he added			0
he urged the government to step back from the september deadline			2
but a spokesman for mr @entity2 said : ‘ pilots of universal free school meals run by the @entity11 and @entity194 started in 2009 and ran for two years			2
‘ evaluation showed clear benefits for all in terms of educational attainment and healthy eating , but in particular for the poorest children			2
the plans are fully tested , well designed and properly funded			0
‘ every child deserves the best possible start in life , and at the same time we are doing all we can to help ease the pressure on household budgets			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity11 said : ‘ we are providing more than £ 1billion to ensure children get a healthy meal in the middle of the day			0
' we ’re also making sure that schools are not left out of pocket by putting £ 150million on the table			0

from september children aged four to seven will qualify for free lunches
but heads have already warned they do not have the facilities to cope
they say the @entity22 - @entity22 scheme just ' was *n't* thought through properly '
