by @entity0 published : 04:46 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 07:23 est , 19 december 2012 for millions of children , @entity2 dinner means just one thing : the dreaded @entity5 sprout			0
would n't it be nicer if the tiny offensive vegetables tasted of , say , cake ? which is precisely what @entity11 - based food artist @entity10 , 41 , thought when she decided to craft a festive feast of turkey and all the trimmings entirely out of sponge cake , chocolate and buttercream icing			1
she painted everything from the sprouts to the tiny herbs on top of the roast turkey			0
for those with a sweet tooth , it 's the perfect opportunity to tuck into desert first as even the gravy and candles were made out of chocolate			0
@entity2 cake ? @entity24 's spongecake dinner includes peas , @entity5 sprouts , toast potatoes , carrots and pigs in blankets @entity56 and trimmings : @entity24 painted everything from the sprouts to the tiny herbs on top of the roast turkey - even the gravy and candles were made out of chocolate along with three other cake artists , @entity24 showed off her skills and managed to pull off the @entity2 dinner which went on display at @entity66 on 13 december			1
incredibly , @entity24 only turned her hand to cake art two years ago when she married her @entity70 husband @entity69 and needed a cake to celebrate the big day			2
the two - tier white chocolate mud cake was a huge hit with her guests , and @entity24 soon found herself with orders coming in from family and friends			2
sweet feast : along with three other cake artists , @entity24 showed off her skills and managed to pull off the @entity2 dinner which went on display at @entity66 on 13 december she decided to put her skills into practice and set up her own business , @entity82 , which she runs from her home in @entity84 , @entity11			1
@entity24 said : ' the hardest part of it for me was getting the herbs to look like real herbs as i 'd never done anything like that before			2
' when i look back at how it all turned out , i 'm really pleased and it 's actually better than i imagined			0
' can we eat it ? visitors to the exhibition in @entity30 were initially shy about scoffing @entity24 's art , but eventually everyone got stuck in the idea behind the sweet dinner was that visitors to the exhibition would eat it - but in typically @entity107 fashion , people were too polite to touch the art , much less take great bites out of it			1
@entity24 said : ' we took the dinner along to the exhibition for people to eat but to begin with everybody was a bit shy about trying tucking in			1
' once the first person tried a bit though , everybody else joined in and it was gone within 30 minutes			0
' and for my next trick : @entity24 runs her own cake business , @entity82 , from her home in @entity84 , @entity11 and just like other artists , @entity24 worries about her work being damaged during delivery - especially if the delivery men are peckish			1
she said : ' it 's always a worry when it comes to delivering my work because you want to make sure it gets there in one piece			0
' myself and the other cake artists got really positive feedback from everybody who saw the dinner so it makes it all worthwhile			0
' to be honest , even though i had to change the turkey about three times , the whole thing was really exciting from start to finish			0
' tuck in : visitors to the exhibition in @entity29 using toothpicks to sample @entity24 's alternative @entity2 dinner @entity24 said : ' myself and the other cake artists got really positive feedback from everybody who saw the dinner so it makes it all worthwhile '			1

@entity154 , 41 , from @entity11 , made ' dinner ' for exhibition
on display at @entity29 , @entity30 , where people are asked to eat it
