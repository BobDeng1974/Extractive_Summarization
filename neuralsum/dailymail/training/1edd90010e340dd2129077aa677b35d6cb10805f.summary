so large that it can be seen from space , it is enough to send shockwaves through even the most cynical @entity4 sceptic			2
this shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly with two giant flippers powering it through the waters of @entity10 was photographed by a satellite			1
for six months the image has been studied by experts at the @entity15 @entity14 , where excitement is mounting after various explanations for it were ruled out ... leaving them to conclude it is ‘ likely ’ to be the elusive beast			2
a shadowy form , pictured , measuring around 100ft long ( 30 metres ) with two giant flippers was photographed by a satellite and spotted on the @entity39 app @entity14 president @entity40 , who keeps a register of sightings , said : ‘ we ’ve been looking at it for a long time trying to work out exactly what it is			1
‘ it looks like a boat wake , but the boat is missing			0
you can see some boats moored at the shore , but there is n’t one here			0
we ’ve shown it to boat experts and they do n’t know what it is			0
‘ whatever this is , it is under the water and heading south , so unless there have been secret submarine trials going on in the loch , the size of the object would make it likely to be @entity4			1
’ he said other ‘ logical ’ explanations – such as a floating log or a seal causing ripples – could not be used to account for the imposing shape either			0
the photographs were captured by two different amateur @entity4 hunters scanning different satellites transmitting images of the earth from space - @entity79 from @entity80 and @entity82 @entity81 the image has ended a recent drought in ‘ confirmed sightings ’ of the creature			1
in february mr @entity40 announced that no one had come forward in the previous 18 months to say they had seen @entity4 – the first time since 1925 this had happened			0
the club was alerted to the new image by two people who noticed it at the end of last year on satellite pictures used by @entity25 for its smartphone maps			1
one of the spotters , @entity99 , 26 , a charity worker for the @entity100 , from @entity101 , @entity81 , said : ‘ it was a total fluke that i found it			0
i was looking at satellite images of my town and then just thought i ’d have a look at @entity10			1
‘ the first thing that came into my head when i saw it was , “ that ’s the @entity4 ”			0
it was the shape of it , i thought it had to be something more than a shadow			0
@entity114 sonar equipment , a yellow submarine , @entity117 actors and even a white witch have all tried to find the elusive @entity4 mr @entity82 said : ' it was purely by accident that i came across the image			0
i was trawling through satellite transmissions of different parts of the country and i thought i would try @entity10 ' the image was recorded by sonar equipment on board the flagship vessel of @entity130 - based @entity129 as it sailed on @entity10 , pictured ‘ it was exciting			1
i ’ve never been to @entity10 but i ’m always interested in that sort of stuff			0
’ @entity79 , from @entity134 , @entity80 , also came across the same image through @entity25 ’s satellite map app. both he and mr @entity82 forwarded the image to the club			1
mr @entity40 , 49 , a chartered accountant who lives in @entity130 , said : ‘ now that we have spies in the skies above @entity10 , maybe we will get more sightings which will whet the appetite of more down to earth @entity4 hunters to come north			0
‘ furthermore , the use of satellite technology means that if @entity4 is just swimming below the surface like in this case , we can still pick her up			1
’ he added : ‘ last year was the first time in almost 90 years that @entity4 was n’t seen at all			0
after @entity4 “ going missing ” for 18 months , it ’s great to see her back			0
’ despite the club ’s claim , however , another explanation for the shape seen in the image could simply be underwater currents in the loch			1
elusive sight : this picture , taken by dr @entity161 in 1934 , is said to show the @entity4 the legend of the @entity4 has been around since the sixth century , when an @entity164 monk called @entity165 witnessed locals burying a man who had been attacked by a ' water beast			2
' one of the first famous sightings was in 1933 , when @entity170 and his wife claimed they saw ' a most extraordinary form of animal ' which was 4ft high and 25ft long crossing the road near the loch			1
the following year , dr @entity177 took a picture , in main story above , which is now the most famous picture of the monster , although it was later revealed to be a hoax made with a toy from @entity183 's			1
@entity184 , centre , was said to have faked footprints which he said were the ' monster 's ' and in 1935 , renowned big game hunter @entity184 found a footprint he said was the monster 's			2
it was later revealed to have been made by him using a dried hippo 's foot of the type used as umbrella stands at the time			2
despite many recording sightings over the years , most have been revealed to be hoaxes and scientists do not give credence to the suggestion that a monster lives in the loch .			2

satellite in the atmosphere was accessed using @entity25 's satellite map app
shows a creature swimming below the surface of the world famous loch
location just south of @entity216 - only be viewed on some @entity217 and @entity218
creature in the water is about 50ft in *length* - half the size of a blue whale
