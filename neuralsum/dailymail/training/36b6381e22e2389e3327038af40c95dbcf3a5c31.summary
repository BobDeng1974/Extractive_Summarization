i knew moving to rugby union would take me out of my comfort zone and that is definitely what has happened in the past couple of months , but i ’m still more determined than ever to make it work			1
even though i ’m a player from league trying to learn a new sport , there has been a lot of hype around me and i ’m expected to do something special every time i play , which is quite hard when i ’m still working out the basics			1
i was under massive scrutiny when i was in the @entity17 in @entity18 , but that was different because i was established and knew the game			2
since i ’ve joined @entity21 , i know everything i do is being watched and dissected , which is no surprise to me given the build - up to my arrival and the way my season finished in @entity18			1
@entity28 has relished his time with @entity21 thus far but knows he has plenty of learning ahead of him @entity28 played outside centre in his side 's recent 17 - 8 loss to @entity35 at @entity36 @entity28 admits the transition from playing rugby league in @entity18 ( above ) to union has been tough when i ’m on the field , those thoughts never enter my mind , but sometimes it ’s hard to miss what people are saying post-match on social media and even just when i ’m grabbing a brew at a cafe in @entity21			1
the key is to not let all the chat affect my confidence in learning a new game which , quite frankly at the moment , i ’m a novice at ! i ’ve been totally honest about my transition by admitting i ’m finding it even harder than i expected			1
there ’s no point me saying that it ’s easy because it definitely is n’t			2
i understand now even more than i did before just how much work it ’s going to take to be successful			0
i just need more time out on the field , in matches			0
it ’s been useful to see the game as a back and as a forward			2
i ’ve been playing at centre for the first team but i ’ve also had a couple of run - outs for the ‘ a ’ team as a flanker and that has been helpful			1
it ’s been like a very intense practice session really — out of the spotlight , with not as many people watching those games , so i can make mistakes and get away with them a bit more ! @entity28 is still learning his trade , especially in defence , after crossing codes from rugby league there were a few thousand people at our home game , including a few boys from the squad who sat up in a box eating curry ! at @entity95 there was a crowd of 5 - 6,000 , which was a great turn - out			1
but of course it was a bit of a change in occasion , after being in an unbelievable competition in the @entity17 and finishing with a @entity105 win in @entity106			1
i had to see the games in a different way ; as a learning process to help me develop my skills			0
in my first ‘ a ’ game , there was a guy from @entity114 who gave me a bit of stick			2
we were in a ruck and he was giving it to me , saying , “ you do n’t know what you ’re doing ”			2
he was probably right , so i just said , “ maybe not , but i know how to tackle , so run at me and we ’ll see how it goes ! ” it was good banter			0
@entity28 admits to struggling with certain technical aspects with the lineout ( above ) proving a big challenge meditation became a valuable tool for me when i was playing rugby league in @entity18 and it ’s a technique i ’ll carry on using for the rest of my career			1
i was quite sceptical when we first started meditating at @entity106 , but i began to connect with the people who were doing the sessions so i bought into it			1
it was all about opening up our minds and talking to each other a bit more , and also about clearing your own mind in terms of being calm and ready to perform			0
we used techniques to bring ourselves back down to a calm level if we found ourselves getting frustrated or lost confidence during a game			2
since joining @entity21 , i ’ve been having sessions with @entity150 , who works with @entity152 drivers and other sportsmen , and lives two minutes away from me			1
i find it really helpful			0
it helps me stay calm , keeps my blood pressure down and keeps my mind focused			0
it ’s even helped me to go easier on refs when decisions go against me ! i truly believe that meditation was a big part of our success at @entity106			1
just before the biggest games of the year , the guys would be laughing and joking , but then everyone would switch on and be in the right mental state to play			2
as i see it , the brain is a muscle and i ’ve got to train it like i train other muscles			0
at @entity21 , it ’s been helping me to visualise the game and accelerate my learning			1
you train your brain with little triggers so when you get into certain match situations , your mind subconsciously knows how to react			0
it is really useful for me during this transition phase			2
i had mentally prepared myself for the fact that there would be a change in the number of plays i would be involved in during games , but it ’s still been tough to get used to			0
the amount of distance covered is similar to what i was doing in league , but in union there is lot more kick - chasing , running off the ball and getting back into position			1
last weekend at @entity35 , i think i touched the ball once in the first 40 minutes , so i had to keep my hands warm ! people who follow and play league do n’t quite understand it			2
my mates have been taking the p * * * out of me about it			0
they were having a laugh because it showed on tv that i ’d made 15 metres , or something like that			2
if you did that in league , it would be embarrassing			2
it ’s just different ; i ’m finding there are less opportunities in union and you do n’t have as much space to play with between the lines of defence			1
@entity221 is more of a mental , tactical game and i ’m enjoying the strategic side of it			1
i like to describe it as a game of chess ( to all my mates in league reading this ! )			1
i ’ve found the rucks hard to get used to , but i ’m starting to learn all the sneaky little tactics			0
i remember my first ruck against @entity234 ; i carried the ball , ended up on the floor on my side and the next thing i knew i was being kneed in the forehead by my own team - mate cleaning the ruck			1
i felt like road - kill ! it ’s such a different experience to being tackled in league , but a fun one			1
i ’ve found the scrums hard too			0
i could n’t be a prop — there ’s so much pressure on their bodies in there			0
when you get a seven or eight - second scrum , you really know about it afterwards			2
my respect for those guys ( and their ears ) is through the roof			0
the best pair of ears i ’ve seen are @entity261 ’ ( @entity21 captain @entity262 ’s ) so far — they ’re a cracking set of cauliflowers ! @entity28 has plenty of new - found respect for the @entity21 forwards including skipper @entity262 ( above ) people have been very interested in what position i ’m playing , but to me there is n’t a big difference			1
at 12 , i stand a bit wider in defence and at @entity273 have to push in the scrums and sometimes i have to go in the lineout			0
that ’s about it in my mind right now			0
another thing people are focusing on a lot is when — or if — @entity282 might pick me			0
i ’ve not heard anything from @entity284 with regards to selection			0
@entity287 , who was a great idol of mine growing up , has given me a call to see how i ’m getting on			0
i ’m sure the coaches will have their eyes on a lot of players at the moment , so i ’m just going to do as much as i can to be in contention			0
i came here to chase a challenge , and it ’s delivering			0
@entity282 assistant coach @entity287 ( above ) has been in touch with @entity28 to monitor his progress @entity28 is a @entity301 ambassador for rugby & training products			1
@entity28 is the face of the new since 1904 fashion range to be launched by @entity301 in february			1
