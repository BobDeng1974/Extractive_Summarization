in a blog post made thursday by head @entity10 security engineer @entity14 , @entity1 said that every time a user checks or sent email , it will be encryped as the data goes to and from @entity1 's servers			1
although @entity1 has given @entity10 users the ability to sign into their accouints through an encrypted connection ( known as @entity24 ) since 2010 , @entity10 will now automatically default users to the more secure network			2

' this ensures that your messages are safe not only when they move between you and @entity10 's servers , but also as they move between @entity1 's data centers — something we made a top priority after last summer ’s revelations			1
' those revelations were made last year by @entity47 , a former @entity3 contractor , who leaked documents about global surveillance efforts used by the agency , including snooping on emails			1
reports have indicated that the @entity3 was hacking into fiber optic cables used by tech companies to send data to and from data servers scattered around			0
the trouble is that the data sent through these cables is usually not encrypted , which allowed @entity3 spies easy access to the information being sent			0

' by protecting the connection between you and @entity1 servers , they protect you against tons of attackers , ' @entity76 , a security researcher in @entity77 , told @entity84			0
however , @entity1 has n't @entity3 - proofed @entity10 completely			0
the agency still has the ability to send out @entity87 letters compelling a company to release information			0
and the federal government has n't been shy requesting data from @entity1			2
in a transparency report , @entity1 said that for the first half of 2013 , it received 25,879 requests for user information from government agencies and courts .			1

all messages sent and received through @entity10 are now *encrpyted* , making them *extremely* *difficult* to intercept
move follows revelations in documents leaked last year by @entity47 that spy agency can look at private messages
in the first half of 2013 , @entity1 received 25,879 requests for user information from federal government and courts
