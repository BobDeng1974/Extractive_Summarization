a mother has told how she made the heartbreaking decision to stop her young daughter ’s cancer treatment for her to enjoy a pain free last @entity5			1
terminally ill three - year - old @entity6 has been battling a rare brain tumour since she was one			1
she was due to start a final cycle of chemotherapy last month to help extend her life			1
but chemotherapy treatment left the little girl from @entity13 , @entity14 , so sick that her mother pleaded with doctors to end it , so @entity6 would be well enough to have fun at @entity5			1
@entity19 said : ' thanks to the amazing support we received after our story appeared we were able to make our daughter 's dream come true just in time ' this @entity5 will be her last , which is why her mother @entity19 is determined to make it the best ever for @entity6 and her sisters @entity30 , seven , and @entity31 , 18 months			1
ms @entity19 , 32 , said : ‘ there will be no tears while @entity6 is here			1
we are lucky enough to have another @entity5 with our darling girl and i want to create happy memories that we can cherish forever			0
‘ @entity36 has ruined every @entity5 she has been old enough to know about so far , but not this one			0
this year she will have fun like other children			0
‘ the treatment will not cure @entity6 so what is the point of continuing if it makes her quality of life so poor she ca n’t enjoy herself ? ‘ she may not have long left so the time we have together is too precious to waste being sick			1
my little girl deserves some laughter and happiness at @entity5			0
’ ms @entity19 is now desperately fundraising to fulfil her daughter 's final @entity5 wish to visit @entity50			1
@entity6 has been battling a rare brain tumour since she was one previous rounds of chemotherapy left @entity6 so sick that her mother pleaded with doctors to end it , so she would be well enough to have fun at @entity5 the little girl asked @entity5 if instead of a present she could go and see her favourite characters again , after fundraisers sent the family to @entity60 last year			1
ms @entity19 said : ‘ i nearly had a heart attack when she told me she had asked @entity5 if she could go back to @entity62			2
she had the absolute time of her life there last year , i have never seen her so happy			2
‘ i had no idea that ’s what she was planning to ask for at @entity5			0
but there is no way i can afford to take her			0
‘ it will break my heart not to be able to give her what she has asked for when i know this will be her last @entity5 with me so i ’ve started fundraising to see if it is possible			1
‘ the best i can do is try like any mum in my shoes would			0
’ ms @entity19 , with her daughters @entity6 , @entity30 and @entity31 , said : ' cancer has ruined every @entity80 has been old enough to know about so far , but not this one			1
this year she will have fun like other children ' @entity6 was born seemingly perfectly healthy on september 30th 2010			1
her mother first feared something was wrong when she was five months old			2
she explained : ‘ i noticed she did n’t push her legs down like @entity30 had done as a baby but my gp told me not to worry and assured me all babies developed differently			0
’ by the time @entity6 was ten months old , ms @entity19 was pregnant again , but still concerned for her baby who was unable to sit unsupported			1
she was referred to the @entity90 in @entity14 for tests and on december 16 2011 @entity92 had a brain scan which revealed a large tumour			1
ms @entity19 said : ‘ no mother expects to hear those words , i was shaking and sobbing			2
’ her mother said : ' the treatment will not cure @entity6 so what is the point of continuing if it makes her quality of life so poor she ca n't enjoy herself ? ' @entity6 's mother says her daughter ' deserves some laughter and happiness ' at the time the tumour was thought not to be cancerous but still needed to be removed within days			1
@entity6 's mother hastily brought @entity5 forward for her little girls to enjoy the big day before their sister returned to hospital for surgery			1
she said : ‘ thankfully they never guessed it was n’t really @entity5			0
we had @entity113 and crackers and lots of presents but in the back of my mind all i could think about was the operation			0
’ days later @entity6 underwent surgery and spent the real @entity120 recovering on the ward			1
but during the eight - hour operation surgeons were only able to remove 80 per cent of the tumour			2
the rest was wrapped around a main blood vessel and too dangerous to remove			0
as she recovered , she was nicknamed the @entity127 by nurses for her courage and bravery			0
but there was bad news when tests revealed the tumour was in fact an extremely rare cancer			0
@entity6 started chemotherapy immediately and three months later in march 2012 , ms @entity19 gave birth to @entity31 but unfortunately separated with the girls ’ father @entity140			2
ms @entity19 said : ' we would n't wish this on anyone			0
but the love and support from strangers who read our story has been humbling and for that we can not say thank you enough ' she said : ' @entity6 loved being a big sister and i hoped the new baby would give her something else to fight for			2
’ but she was n't responding to treatment as hoped , so her family began fundraising for pioneering proton treatment in @entity156			2
last @entity5 she battled through more chemotherapy and the family prayed it would work			0
but in september this year doctors broke the terrible news that @entity6 would not survive and had just ten months left to live			1
ms @entity19 said : ' i will never ever forget those words			0
they told me my little girl would never grow up and in that moment my heart shattered forever			0
in september this year doctors broke the terrible news that @entity6 would not survive and had just ten months left to live ‘ but i knew i could not cry , not while i still had @entity6 in my arms , because instead of fighting for her life , i now had to fight to ensure she had the best possible time while she was alive			1
’ chemotherapy was arranged to try and prolong the her life but the first round left her so sick and weak her mother spoke to doctors about ending treatment			1
she said : ‘ i could n’t bear to see the precious time she had left wasted being ill on hospital wards			0
she ’d been through so much already and i felt it was time for her to start enjoying life			2
‘ @entity5 was coming and she was so excited			0
i did n’t want it ruined by treatment that could n’t save her			0
’ @entity6 's consultant agreed that her quality of life would be so poor the treatment should be stopped for her to have some fun			1
he also advised the family not to waste their time going to @entity156 for treatment			0
ms @entity19 is now fundraising to try and make her daughter 's last ever @entity5 wish come true instead it was agreed that the tens of thousands that had been raised by well wishers to send her to @entity156 should instead help other children with cancer			2
the cash was used to purchase a caravan which is now available for free holidays to families who need them most			0
it was named the @entity207 after @entity6			2
so when @entity6 revealed her @entity5 wish this year , it meant her mother had to start fundraising again			1
she is now hoping the public will get behind her one last time to make her daughter 's last ever @entity5 wish come true			0
