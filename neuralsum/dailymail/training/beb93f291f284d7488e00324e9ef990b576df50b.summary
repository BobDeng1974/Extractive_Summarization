after their divorce in 1992 , mr @entity9 lived in an old ambulance he powered with a home - made wind turbine made from recycled materials			1
a strict vegan with shaggy hair and an earring , he was described in the @entity45 as ‘ the most improbable candidate for affluence ’			0
but in 1995 , mr @entity9 founded @entity48 , which is now one of the @entity51 ’s biggest green energy companies and led to him being awarded @entity52 in 2004			1
now worth an estimated £ 107 million , he owns a sports car and lives in the £ 3million 18th century @entity54 , near @entity55 , @entity56 , with his new wife and their five - year - old son			1
he also owns a football club , @entity56 ’s @entity60 where he has banned red meat , and installed an organic football pitch , avoiding the use of chemicals and cut by a solar - powered lawnmower			0
meanwhile @entity66 , 55 , says she is so poor that she has been travelling to hearings from her home in @entity69 by bus – and has been sleeping in a bus station			0
her claim for maintenance was struck out by the @entity45 , but her lawyers are now challenging this decision in the @entity24			0
if she is successful , it will lead to a full hearing before a family judge who will decide whether any financial settlement is due			0
£ 3m hone : where mr @entity9 lives with his new wife and son yesterday , she said in statement read out to the court that she had waited this long to make her claim because she was afraid of her ex-husband			1
when they divorced , she was left to care for the couple ’s young son and her daughter from a previous relationship , who mr @entity9 treated as his own during their marriage			1
she said she had gone to mr @entity9 in the early 1990s ‘ desperate ’ for money but had been ‘ fobbed off ’			2
she said : ‘ he said he could not help because his business was too much of a strain on his resources			0
i did n’t know what to do so in 1995 i contacted the @entity99 ( @entity99 )			0
’ the @entity99 then began investigating the finances of mr @entity9 , prompting him to become ‘ abusive ’ , according to his ex-wife			1
@entity8 ( pictured right in 2003 ) said she feared @entity9 ( left ) would ‘ become violent ’ when she went to him begging for cash after being left on benefits with two children she added : ‘ i could n’t cope with the stress caused by him			2
i asked them to stop the assessment because i feared @entity9 would become violent towards me			2
’ the court heard mr @entity9 ’s finances improved ‘ significantly ’ after 1997 and continued to grow until the present day			1
he was worth an estimated £ 57 million in 2012 , which rose to £ 107 million according to the latest figures			1
@entity112 , for @entity66 , said : ‘ we have no problem with that			0
it ’s a remarkable story			0
the issue is whether the wife is entitled to a penny of that or not			0
‘ all the way through the 1990s and 2000s , she was clearly asking for assistance			0
it ’s a sorry state that … in 2007 when the business was clearly flying and mr @entity9 had had his obe for three years , she was n’t receiving a penny , and was having to borrow money from her son			1
’ green energy entrepreneur mr @entity9 is worth an estimated £ 107 million according to recent figures last year , senior family judge @entity130 said she had left her claim - amounting to around £ 100,000 for every year since she divorced him in 1992 - far too late			1
but mr @entity131 said yesterday : ‘ this case should not have been struck out			0
we say the @entity45 , with the greatest respect , got this wrong			0
’ the court heard miss @entity8 found a new partner in 1993 and had two more children with him – but that he subsequently did not finance the family either			0
miss @entity8 was able to make the claim against mr @entity9 because in family law cases , unlike in the civil courts , there is no time limit for a former spouse to bring a financial lawsuit			1
neither kept any documents from their divorce and the solicitors ’ files have long since been shredded			0
@entity152 , mr @entity9 ’s solicitor and head of the family division at @entity155 , said the case was significant because those who divorced young often did not resolve financial settlements if there was little wealth to share at the time			1
she told the @entity162 : ‘ there are plenty of people who separated decades ago but have not got divorced or if they did get divorced at the time did not deal with financial claims and so this could have profound implications			0
’ the case , which is being heard by a panel of five judges led by @entity51 ’s most senior female judge @entity172 , is expected to conclude tomorrow .			2

she is taking the green entrepreneur to court 22 years after they divorced
pair married in 1981 when they were penniless travellers and divorced 1992
in 1995 mr @entity9 founded one of @entity51 ’s biggest green energy companies
