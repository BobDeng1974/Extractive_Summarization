new satellite images show the true extent of the record drought hitting @entity3 , as the state declares an emergency and seeks federal aid			1
the @entity8 images show how the state 's landscape is parched with minimal snow cover and the land dried out compared to the same time last year			2
the dry year @entity3 experienced in 2013 has left fresh water reservoirs with a fraction of their normal reserves and slowed the normally full @entity18 so dramatically that brush and dry riverbed are showing through in areas normally teeming with fish			1
' we ca n't make it rain , but we can be much better prepared for the terrible consequences that @entity3 's drought now threatens , including dramatically less water for our farms and communities and increased fires in both urban and rural areas , ' governor @entity23 , a @entity24 , said in a statement			1
speaking at a news conference in @entity46 , he said the drought threatens to leave farms and communities with dramatically less water and increases the risk of fires in both urban and rural areas			2
he appealed to residents to keep a lid on water use with the aim of reducing overall consumption by 20 percent , telling them that ' this takes everybody pitching in			0
' he warned that mandatory conservation programs may be initiated down the road			0
in a sign of the severity of the drought , some of the state 's reservoirs are at their lowest levels in years			1
the @entity81 near @entity82 is so low that the remains of a @entity83 - era ghost town - flooded to create the lake in the 1950s - are visible for the first time in years			1
the state 's mountain ranges , where runoff from melting snow provides much of the water for @entity3 's thirsty cities and farms , have just 20 per cent of the snow they normally have at this time of year , officials noted			1
parched : water levels for many of @entity3 's major reservoirs are well below average and dropping ; concern is mounting that @entity3 may be headed for a replay of the big drought of the late 1980s through the early 1990s , or even worse , 1977 @entity105 , the largest reservoir in @entity3 , is down from its historical average by nearly half			1
other sources of water , including the massive @entity111 , are also affected , prompting cities to dip into reserves and forcing farmers to scramble			0
some public agencies may be able to purchase just five per cent of the water that they contracted to buy from the state			0
adding to concerns , january and february are usually the wettest months in much of the state , but 2014 has so far been mostly dry , with little precipitation expected , according to the @entity122			0
in declaring a drought emergency , @entity23 said he did not know if he would be successful in persuading the federal government to free up funds for drought relief but he would try his best			1
' it 's important , first of all , to awaken all @entity3 to the serious matter of drought , ' he said , also warning of upcoming ' conflicts and different perceptions on how water is to be allocated			2
' @entity133 has long been a contentious issue in @entity3 , where it has been diverted from mountain lakes and streams to irrigate farms and slake the thirst of metropolitan areas			0
tinderbox : firefighter @entity140 sprays water as he battles the @entity142 today near @entity143 , @entity3 working around the clock : a truck clears away rocks along @entity147 as firefighters continue to battle the @entity142 that was sparked thursday morning many of the state 's efforts to deal with the problem are controversial , including a $ 25 billion plan to divert water from above the delta by sending it through a pair of huge tunnels			1
for many in the state 's $ 44.7 billion agriculture business , water scarcity is a problem made worse by a recent switch to orchard - style crops such as almonds and olives			1
unlike vegetables or cotton , which grow in fields that can be left fallow in dry years , the trees need water every year			0
already , there were signs of competing priorities among groups that contend for water and will be closely watching how state officials use their new flexibility in allocating it			0
assemblywoman @entity180 , the leader of the @entity182 minority in the @entity183 who represents a heavily agricultural area in central @entity3 , expressed hope that with the declaration more water could go toward ' @entity189 farmers and workers who depend on water to feed the world			0
' low and dropping : governor @entity23 points to images showing the snow depth in the @entity196 mountains on january 13 , 2013 ( left ) and january 13 , 2014 ( center ) while declaring a drought state of emergency in @entity46 @entity199 , executive director of the @entity200 , said his group 's concern was for the health of salmon and a fishing industry that supports tens of thousands of jobs in @entity3 and @entity207			1
' if the drought declaration results in more attention to saving the salmon that are in the @entity189 rivers , and which are in dire need of attention , then that is good thing , ' he said			0
@entity216 , an attorney at the @entity217 , said @entity3 has a complex system that allocates water to areas that laid claim to it first - often over 100 years ago - and which many view the system as unfair			2
' because it 's so contentious , there are times when it 's hard to make progress , ' @entity216 said			0
but in some ways the state has done well			0
over the last 40 years , the state 's agriculture industry has doubled the revenue per drop of water used , largely from improved efficiency and changes in the plants grown , @entity216 said .			2

governor @entity23 has declared a drought emergency
the move will allow @entity3 to seek federal aid as the state 's water reservoirs fall *dangerously* low
a *wildfire* is burning near @entity247 and has claimed five homes already
agricultural and farming areas as well as urban areas face dire consequences if the state does not prepare *fordrought*
@entity81 near @entity82 is so low that the remains of a @entity83 - era ghost town - flooded to create the lake in the 1950s - are visible for the first time in years
