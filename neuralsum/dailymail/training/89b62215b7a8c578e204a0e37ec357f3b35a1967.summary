@entity0 will not be signing a new contract at @entity2 , although the defender insists he remains ' very happy ' at @entity4			1
the 27 - year - old has been one of @entity2 ' best performers during the often tumultuous period since arriving from @entity8 in 2012			1
such form has seen @entity10 regularly linked with a move away from north @entity12 , although he looked set to follow @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 in signing a new long - term deal this summer			1
@entity0 is satisfied with live at @entity2 currently but is in no rush to sign a new deal @entity10 looks on after missing a gilt - edged chance in the @entity21 against @entity22 two weeks ago his agent , @entity23 , said he was close to agreeing a new long - term deal at @entity2 , although @entity10 says those negotiations have now ended			1
' i am not signing , no , ' @entity0 said			1
' we agreed not to			0
' i would prefer not to say why			0
i still have four years left			0
i am happy at the club and i think they are happy with me			0
that 's where it ends			0
' i am very happy , we have a good manager , we have a good team and a lot of good players			1
' the squad is very big and you have to work hard to play every game and i hope i am playing again soon			0
' the news will come as a blow to @entity2 fans , many of whom have been surprised by his lack of opportunities under @entity49 in recent weeks			1
previously one of the first names on the team sheet , he has found time restricted as the former @entity55 international rotates his side			0
' i hope i play every game in the weekends and midweek , ' @entity0 said , having been restored to the starting line - up for the 3 - 1 @entity21 win against @entity22			1
' i want to play in the biggest games			0
that is what you are a footballer for			0
' we have got a lot of centre - backs now with @entity68 , with @entity69 who is doing very well			2
' obviously @entity70 ( @entity71 ) and @entity72 ( @entity72 ) played at the weekend and we are fighting for two places with those guys			0
' everyone has to be just that little bit better so the manager chooses them			2
' rumours have grown of an issue between @entity49 and @entity10 , although the @entity81 was quick to dismiss such talk			1
' he is working well with a lot of videos and individually he talks a lot with the players , ' he said			0
@entity10 was quick to quash any rumours that he and manager @entity49 have fallen out @entity88 expresses his frustration during their home defeat to @entity92 last weekend ' he is a manager who expects a lot from players			1
we work hard and that is good - it will pay off in the end , i think			2
' wednesday 's defeat of @entity22 was a timely shot in the arm for @entity2 after a four - match winless streak			1
extending that run further would have made life in tougher heading to the @entity106 this weekend to take on bitter rivals @entity107			2
' it is a very good team , ' @entity0 said			1
' they have got a lot of good players and i think they improved every year since i came here			2
' they have got a very good team at the moment with the pace they have got up front with @entity118 , who i think is a very good signing , and @entity120 as well			2
' they have got a lot of creativity and movement and they are just one of the best teams in the league and very difficult to beat , especially at their ground			0
' @entity2 ' determination to do well at the @entity106 was highlighted by the 11 changes they made against @entity22 , who themselves made nine alterations as they look to keep their promotion charge on track			1
one of those coming in was 19 - year - old @entity137 , who capped his full debut with a goal that looked like it would hand @entity141 's side victory			1
efforts from @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity15 put paid to that , though , on a night that will live long in the midfielder 's memory despite the defeat			0
' i 'll remember that forever , ' @entity137 said			0
' it was my first start and to get a goal was great but we wanted to win the game really and it 's unlucky that we have n't			2

@entity0 insists he wo n't be signing a new deal at @entity2 in the near *future*
however the defender remains content with life at @entity4
the 27 - year - old also quashed speculation that he and manager @entity49 have fallen out
