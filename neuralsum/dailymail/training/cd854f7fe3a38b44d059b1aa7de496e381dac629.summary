@entity0 today ordered the massive expansion of controversial shale gas exploration in @entity3 – known as fracking – despite fears it could cause earthquakes and contaminate water			1
to the fury of environmentalists , the chancellor wants to encourage more companies to use the technique , which involves creating explosions deep underground to release valuable gas			1
mr @entity0 unveiled his ' generous new tax regime ' in the @entity17 this afternoon to encourage fracking exploration and unlock shale gas reserves that could be worth £ 1.5trillion to @entity3 's economy			1
the @entity3 's only fracking operation in @entity22 caused two tremors from its drilling last year and is waiting to hear if it can start again			1
controversial : drilling in the @entity22 area last year caused a small earthquake but the government wants to expand the use of fracking in @entity3 fracking , or hydraulic fracturing , is the process of injecting liquid deep underground to fracture shale rock and release gas contained in it			1
the government is consulting on tax breaks for the unconventional fossil fuel extraction , which has been widely exploited in the @entity40 , leading to falling gas prices			1
but there are also fears that widespread use of shale gas wells will harm the look of the @entity3 countryside , damage tourism and reduce house prices			1
opposition to fracking is intensifying in @entity3 as the jury is still out on whether the controversial gas extraction process will poison drinking water and cause major environmental damage			1
in @entity22 last year , fracking was found to be the ' highly probable ' cause of earth tremors			1
one tremor of magnitude 2.3 on the @entity60 hit the area on april 1 followed by a second of magnitude 1.4 on may 27 , prompting locals and environmental campaigners to blame the fracking technique being used locally by oil and gas firm @entity67			0
energy companies have said the process is safe but environment groups warn it could pose human health risks			0
@entity72 , chief executive of @entity67 , has said the process does not pose a threat to @entity3 groundwater			1
but horror stories have emerged from the @entity40 , where fracking is common , including reports of tap water igniting when a match is lit and claims of contaminated water making people ill. such concerns have led to bans or moratoria on fracking in some places			1
@entity87 has banned fracking from shale rock and @entity90 has introduced a moratorium			0
environmental groups in the @entity3 have been calling for a moratorium at least until environmental and safety impacts have been addressed			2
in @entity97 , ground water and soil contamination fears have led farmers and green groups to form an unlikely alliance against fracking			2
concerns have also been raised that fracking could pose a threat to @entity107 ’s world - famous hot springs			0
@entity107 said in september that two resource companies have applied for planning permission to test - drill for gas but the council fears that , if allowed to go ahead , it could harm the springs			0
despite this the chancellor today told mps : ' we must ensure we make the best use of lower cost gas power , including new sources of gas under the land			0
' we do n’t want @entity3 families and businesses to be left behind as gas prices tumble on the other side of the @entity126			2
' we are consulting on new tax incentives for shale gas and announcing the creation of a single office so that regulation is safe but simple			0
' the chancellor is desperate to boost domestic gas exploration as a way of reducing @entity3 ’s dependence on foreign gas supplies			2
the sharp decline in @entity139 gas finds makes @entity3 more reliant on energy supplies from @entity141 , @entity142 and the @entity40			2
but environmentalists attacked the move for undermining investment and jobs which could be created in clean technology , as well as pushing up energy costs for consumers as the @entity3 would remain tied to increasingly expensive fossil fuels			1
the @entity151 will join up responsibilities across government departments to provide a single point of contact for investors and streamline the regulatory process			0
even if ten per cent of the gas in unpopulated areas is extracted , it would still be worth £ 150billion			0
@entity161 , head of energy policy at @entity163 , said : ' the @entity3 ’s over-reliance on gas is , environmentally and economically , highly risky			2
@entity167 political director @entity166 said : ' the chancellor is misleading people to position shale gas as the answer to @entity3 ’s energy woes			2
' the consultation on tax breaks for shale gas in the @entity3 was welcomed by @entity67 , the company seeking to exploit shale resources near @entity22 whose work was suspended last year after fracking triggered two tremors in the area			1
the @entity182 is due to make an announcement next week on whether @entity67 ’s operations can restart			0
the company wants to drill , fracture and test a small of wells in 2013			0
@entity188 , chief executive of @entity67 , said : ' exploration is necessary to have a better understanding about how shale gas can be developed safely and sensibly from the @entity192			0
' costs in a technology industry such as ours will be higher at the outset , but will reduce over time as the industry grows			0
' anger : a demonstrator wears a @entity0 mask as part of protests against fracking but the chancellor is offering huge incentives for companies to use the technique in @entity3 but environmentalists have pledged to fight it			1
@entity210 from @entity212 @entity211 , said : ' local people are extremely alarmed by @entity0 ’s fracking plans - they could pollute our clean water and air , threaten house prices and destroy our vital farming and tourism sectors			2
' we will fight any plans that could turn a beautiful part of the @entity212 countryside into a wasteland			0
' anger : demonstrators hold placards in front of their mock fracking rig in protest outside the @entity231			0

companies offered huge tax breaks to mine @entity3 's underground *gasfields*
but environmentalists say it causes earthquakes and contaminates water
