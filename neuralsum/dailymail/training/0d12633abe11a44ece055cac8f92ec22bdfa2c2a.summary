milestone : @entity8 has been named as the first female member if the board of @entity4 after the company came under scrutiny for having very little diversity on their board @entity4 , like @entity30 before its own ipo , was criticized for not having women or minorities on its board of directors			1
faced with its lack of board diversity - three of @entity4 's directors are named @entity41 - ceo @entity40 tweeted earlier this year that diversifying the board ' has to be about more than checking a box			2
' she confirmed the announcement by posting her first @entity4 : ' thank you			0
there could n't be a more exciting time in @entity4 's history to join ! ' @entity30 named its chief operating officer , @entity50 , to its board after it went public in may 2012			0
boys club : @entity4 came under fire because so many of the company heads - like ( left to right ) co-founders @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and ceo @entity58 - were white men unlike @entity30 , though , @entity4 still does n't have any high - ranking female executives			0
@entity8 joins @entity61 , chairman @entity55 , along with co-founder @entity62 and venture capitalists such as @entity64 , a general partner at @entity65 , on @entity4 's board			2

record breaker : @entity8 ( seen here in 2000 ) was the first woman to become ceo of a @entity79 company when she held the title of @entity9 ceo 16 years ago during her time at @entity9 , @entity8 was the first woman to become ceo of a @entity79 company when she held the title 16 years ago			1
the index of leading @entity15 stocks is similar to the @entity86 500 in the @entity13 in her words , not much has changed in that time when it comes to gender imbalance			0
last year , she told the @entity91 that she ' thought in 1997 that by the time i left @entity9 things would be different in terms of how many women there were as chief executives or chairmen or board members			2
it 's not too different and for that i 'm sorry			0
