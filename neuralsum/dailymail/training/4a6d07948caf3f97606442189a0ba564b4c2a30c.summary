by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:24 est , 7 january 2013 updated : 05:39 est , 8 january 2013 @entity2 will appear on @entity3 every thursday morning , in an attempt to find out what people are thinking @entity2 is to host a weekly radio phone - in an extraordinary attempt to win over voters as @entity11 strategists warn they have a year to turn the party ’s poll ratings around			1
in an unprecedented move for a party leader , the deputy prime minister is to take calls from listeners every thursday to find out what ‘ people are thinking ’			1
named ' @entity20 ' the weekly show is a massive gamble and could see the @entity11 boss berated for every government gaffe and unpopular policy in the news			1
@entity28 mps branded the show ' bizarre ' and claimed he would spend more time answering questions on the radio than from mps in the @entity34			1
it comes as mr @entity2 has been put on notice that he only has until the end of 2013 to rescue dozens of his mps from wipeout			1
the bizarre move to swap the @entity41 for the @entity43 's studio also risked over-shadowing the coalition 's @entity44 , which is supposed to present a united front with the conservatives			1
mr @entity2 , who celebrates his 46th birthday today , staged a joint press conference with @entity50 yesterday afternoon , setting out a raft of new policies to be implemented before the 2015 election			0
but the decision to announce that he will be putting himself at the mercy of radio listeners will be seen as an attempt to distance himself from the coalition			2
mr @entity2 , who has seen his party over-taken in the polls by the @entity63 @entity62 , hopes to turn his ratings around by appearing on @entity66 's @entity3 radio station every thursday morning			1
aides say he is ' comfortable with the format ' which will see him spend half an hour every week answering calls , texts and emails			1
it means he will spend two hours - a - month responding to questions on the radio , three times the 40 minutes he spends dealing with oral questions at the @entity41 as deputy prime minister			1
call @entity2 will be hosted by @entity3 presenter @entity77 , who hols regular phone - ins with @entity66 mayor @entity79 @entity28 mp @entity80 said : ' having sat and listened to him at @entity82 's questions , he has never answered a question yet so he is n't likely to break the habit of a lifetime on the radio			1
' why does n't he just get on with the job ? he is completely invisible anyway , so it 's a good job it 's on the radio not the television because viewers would n't be able to see him			2
' @entity28 mp @entity92 said the idea of the @entity20 show was ‘ bizarre ’			1
‘ the public will get more chance to question him than mps			0
i would have thought he should be spending his time as deputy prime minister supporting the prime minister in his activities			1
‘ i am quite amazed that he has got enough time to go off and do a radio programme every thursday			1
’ @entity2 is not the first politician to use tv and radio shows to broaden his appeal , but not all have been successful			2
@entity28 mp @entity109 entered the i ’m a celebrity jungle in november , claiming she was going where the voters are and would highlight important policies like lowering the abortion limit			0
instead she was seen eating camel toe and was the first star to be kicked off the show in a public vote			2
@entity120 , the former @entity28 chancellor who joined the coalition @entity121 , hosted nine series of his @entity124 series @entity125			0
@entity126 , the @entity11 business secretary , scored an impressive 36 - 40 when he appeared on the @entity128 special of @entity129 in 2010			1
@entity11 mp @entity130 moonlights as a rock dj on community station @entity132 in his @entity134 constituency			1
but he risked controversy when he claimed rock giants @entity136 were not the best bad to emerge from the @entity137 , preferring instead 70s act @entity139			0
transport minister @entity140 hosts @entity141 on @entity142 , promising ‘ an eclectic mix of jazz , blues , swing , country and a lot more besides , from the 1920s to the present day , with the emphasis on the laid back ’			0
the @entity11 admits his records ‘ are a little bit offbeat ’			1
respect mp @entity153 did little to improve the reputation of politicians when he entered the @entity157 house in 2006 , donning a red cat suit to purr and lick milk from the hand of actress @entity161			2
he later hosted a show on @entity163 for six years until 2012			0
mr @entity2 will be co-hosting with @entity3 presenter @entity77 , following in the footsteps of @entity66 mayor @entity79 who also takes part in regular phone - ins on the station			1
‘ i 'm doing this because i do n't think politicians get to hear enough from people directly , ’ mr @entity2 said			0
‘ you ca n't do the right thing in government unless you keep in touch with how people are thinking and feeling			1
' @entity77 is known as the interviewer that all politicians fear			0
he can be very tough but he 's generally fair , very well informed and i hope we ’ll make a good combination for the show we 're doing together			0
' but @entity183 mp @entity182 said : ' it shows how irrelevant he is to the running of the country			0
my question to ask @entity2 is : what 's the point of @entity2 ? is he @entity190 in disguise ? ' in a @entity193 opinion poll yesterday the @entity11 were on 11 per cent , well behind @entity62 which has surged to 16 per cent on the back of rising dissatisfaction with the government ’s stance on @entity198			1
@entity11 have repeatedly stressed that the five - year parliament gives them chance to reverse their woeful ratings			1
however , senior party figures now admit that without a major change in fortunes in the next 12 months , mr @entity2 could be in trouble			0
‘ we have kept saying we have got plenty of time but we ’ve really got to see things turning around this year , ’ a senior @entity11 source told @entity1			1
‘ if we get to the end of 2013 and the polls are still bad for @entity2 , we will be in trouble			2
’ @entity11 insiders say they hope the clips of mr @entity2 's show will be used across the @entity215 , which owns @entity3 as well as stations like @entity217 and @entity218			1
mr @entity2 's latest attempt to reach out to voters comes after his @entity222 video apology for promising to vote against tuition fees was remixed , ridiculed and released as a single , reaching 143 in the charts			0
by putting himself at the mercy of angry voters every week , mr @entity2 's attempt to connect with voters could backfire			0
' it wo n't be faultless every week , ' an advisor said			0
' that 's the risk of doing live radio			0
' @entity234 , @entity215 ’s director of broadcasting , said : ' once again , @entity3 delivers a first , as we welcome the deputy prime minister to @entity66 ’s biggest conversation			1
' no other station offers its listeners such unique access to a senior member of @entity243			0
this will be must - listen radio			2
' the show , for which mr @entity2 is not being paid , starts this thursday from 9am			2
the decision may go down badly with mr @entity2 ’s constituents in @entity249 , where he has been mp since 2005			0
local @entity11 blamed him for losing control of the city council to labour last year			2
@entity252 , @entity183 mp for @entity253 said : ‘ that is extraordinary			0
i think that his constituents in @entity249 are right to ask why he ’s chosen to engage in a conversation with @entity66 voters , on a regional programme every week , instead of the people of the city he purports to represent			0
' is he too unnerved by what he knows he would hear from @entity249 voters ? ‘ also i would have thought that at a time when working families are facing rising costs , and tightening budgets , he ought to be concentrating on his day job of running the country instead of doing a talk show with @entity66 radio listeners			2
’ @entity276 , @entity11 education minister and a key ally of mr @entity2 , insisted that despite wofeul poll ratings and local election results , the party 's remaining supporters are ' realistic ' about the need for difficult decisions			1
' @entity11 , like everybody else , can count			2
they can count that when we came to power we had a deficit of £ 160 thousand million pounds , ' he told @entity124 's today programme			0
' our supporters are realistic about this			0
they know there are tough times			0
they do not believe that every decision made by the government in these circumstances can be an easy and popular one			0
' we are still united as a party in believing that we need to be in coalition to deliver for the country , put our policies into practice , and also because the electorate in may 2010 did not give a majority to any one party			0
' mr @entity50 and mr @entity2 today sought to prevent the break - up of the coalition for another two and a half years , unveiling a raft of new ideas to last them until 2015			2
making a rare joint appearance in @entity311 , the @entity28 and @entity11 leaders dismissed calls from their backbenchers for an early ' divorce ' to insist their commitment to the power - sharing deal was ' unwavering '			1
launching the 52 - page @entity44 , the two men hailed their progress in tackling the vast debts inherited from the @entity183 and pledged action on cutting childcare costs , increasing the state pension and investing in new roads , rail links and affordable homes .			0
