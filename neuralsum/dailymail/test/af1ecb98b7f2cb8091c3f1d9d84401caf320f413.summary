@entity0 has launched an outspoken attack on president @entity2 for refusing to use the word ' genocide ' as he marked the 100th anniversary of the massacre of 1.5 million @entity7			1
the reality star said it was ' very disappointing ' that he stopped short of using the word - which he had promised to use when he ran for office			0
@entity0 , whose @entity13 heritage comes from her father , the late @entity14 , has used her celebrity since 2011 to bring awareness to the genocide			1
marking the anniversary of the mass murder at the weekend , @entity0 wrote in an op - ed in @entity22 : ' i would like president @entity2 to use the word " genocide "			1
it ’s very disappointing he has n’t used it as president			0
' we thought it was going to happen this year			0
i feel like we ’re close — but we ’re definitely moving in the right direction			0
marking the anniversary of the mass murder last weekend , @entity0 wrote in an op - ed , ' i would like president @entity2 to use the word “ genocide			1
” it ’s very disappointing he has n’t used it as president ' tricky language : president @entity2 sent an administration official to @entity47 to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1915 massacre by @entity50			1
but he refused to call the mass killings of ethnic @entity7 a ' genocide ' for fear of offending ally @entity54 @entity56 : historians estimate that 1.5 million @entity7 were killed by @entity50 during @entity58 , @entity7 are made to march in this picture from the 1915 massacre @entity0 and @entity32 walk in the plaza at the @entity62			1
they were accompanied by their cousins @entity66 and @entity67 and @entity0 's husband @entity68			1
@entity0 and @entity32 's @entity13 heritage comes from their father , the late @entity14 as a senator and presidential candidate , @entity2 did describe the killings of @entity7 as genocide			1
but he has never used that description since taking office , mainly out of deference to @entity54 , a key @entity80 partner			1
the @entity81 said @entity80 officials pledged to @entity13 - @entity80 leaders that the @entity80 would use last week 's 100th anniversary of the killings ' to urge a full , frank and just acknowledgement of the facts , ' but a statement about the meeting did not include the word ' genocide			1
' historians estimate up to 1.5 million @entity7 were killed by @entity50 , an event widely viewed by scholars as a genocide			1
@entity54 , however , denies that the deaths constituted genocide because it was not an ethnic - driven battle and says the death toll has been inflated			1
@entity101 rep. @entity100 also said he was ' deeply disappointed ' by the president 's decision			0
' the @entity80 has long prided itself for being a beacon of human rights , for speaking out against atrocity , for confronting painful chapters of its own past and that of others , ' said @entity100			2
' this can not be squared with a policy of complicity in genocide denial by the president or @entity116			0
' @entity0 , who recently traveled to the country for the first time with her husband @entity68 , sister @entity32 and cousins @entity66 and @entity121 , said , ' now is the time to speak out , and every little bit helps ' ' i will continue to ask the questions and fight for the genocide to be recognized for what it was , ' the reality television star said , encouraging @entity54 to label the killings as a genocide			1
' it ’s not the fault of the people who live there now , ' she noted , and ' i think if they recognize it and acknowledge it , everyone can move on			0
' i believe in moving on and looking toward a brighter future , but you ca n’t move on unless you acknowledge the past			0
to not do so is an act of disrespect			0
' paying their respects : @entity0 has used her celebrity status to bring awareness to the genocide since at least 2011			2
the @entity151 has also called the slaughter ' the first genocide of the 20th century ' @entity0 and @entity68 are pictured here with daughter @entity155 and @entity32 as they walk inside church hallways to view art prior to baptism in at @entity161			1
james in the historic @entity163 of the @entity164 last year for @entity166 's christening @entity0 recalled in the op - ed that her family tree would have ended if her grandparents had n't left @entity47 for @entity171 the year before the armed conflict			1
' there are so many people who lost their families , and the stories of how they were killed are so heartbreaking — they should never be forgotten , ' she wrote			0
' the whole point of remembering the genocide is to make sure it does n’t happen again			0
a million - and - a - half people were brutally massacred , and a country can just pretend like it never happened ? i do n’t think that ’s right			2
' while in @entity47 , @entity0 and her family visited the @entity189 monument ’s eternal flame that honors those countryman who were killed in 1915			1
' an emotional day at the genocide museum , ' read a tweet posted by @entity0 that was accompanied by a photo of her and @entity32 laying flowers at the flame			2
@entity0 has been publicly calling for the deaths to be recognized as a genocide since 2011 , when she wrote in a blog post , ' every year , i honor the memory of the martyrs who were killed during the @entity204			1
even though so many countries around the world recognize the @entity204 , the government of @entity54 still denies it			2
' it happened before @entity209 , @entity210 , and the @entity211			0
maybe none of those other genocides would have happened if more nations had condemned the @entity215 , when 1.5 million @entity7 were massacred			1
' during their trip to her ancestors ' homeland , @entity0 , @entity32 and their cousins met with the country 's prime minister , @entity222 , who ' expressed how proud they are that we are proud @entity7 and we have not forgotten our roots ! ' @entity0 said in a tweet			1
@entity0 's husband @entity68 also threw an impromptu bash and free concert in @entity230 at @entity231 before departing @entity47 for @entity232 , @entity233 - the location of their daughter 's christening at an @entity13 church in 2014			1
the @entity239 also visited the @entity240 during their trip to @entity47 @entity32 wrote in a tweet on the day of their visit to the genocide memorial : ' my sister and i are trying to bring awareness not only to our @entity13 genocide but genocides and human slaughter , in general			1
knowledge is power ! ' ' the @entity239 have helped strike a powerful blow at @entity54 's campaign of genocide denial , ' @entity256 communications director told @entity260 after the visit			1
their trip to @entity47 ' has helped shine a global spotlight ' on the genocide and ' the need for justice for that crime with millions , ' she said			0
@entity32 also kept the campaign going after she returned home , asking her fan base on @entity271 to sign a @entity273 petition ' to bring awareness to the @entity13 genocide ' by requesting that @entity276 highlight the conflict with its homepage doodle on the anniversary of the killings , april 24			2
' i did ! ! ! ' she said			0
as of friday the online petition had garnered more than 202,129 supporters , beating its goal of 200,000 names			0
@entity276 did not wade in the controversy by adopting the suggested doodle , however			0
the @entity81 said last week that while it understands the perspective of those hoping to hear different language from @entity2 this year , the administration believes its approach is right , ' both for acknowledging the past , and for our ability to work with regional partners to save lives in the present			2
' it announced at the same time that treasury secretary @entity299 would attend a ceremony in @entity47 on friday making the anniversary			0
' president @entity2 's surrender to @entity54 represents a national disgrace , ' @entity256 chairman ( @entity256 ) @entity303 said in a statement			1
' it is , very simply , a betrayal of truth , a betrayal of trust			0
' the @entity151 added his name this year to the list of high - profile leaders characterizing the 1915 slaughter as the ' first genocide of the @entity316			2
' he further proclaimed that ' concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it			0
' ties that bind : the @entity0 family tree that traces back to two @entity13 families home : @entity0 's ancient ancestors fled the @entity13 village @entity326 ( pictured recently ) to escape a prophecised genocide that did come to pass genocide : the village of @entity330 ( pictured in the @entity331 ) was among hundreds destroyed as the @entity50 laid waste to the region			1
residents - possibly including the @entity239 - can be seen standing by their traditional houses disputed : @entity13 lands ( in red ) were disputed just after the turn of the @entity316 , with bloody consequences @entity7 say up to 1.5 million of their kin were killed between 1915 and 1917 as the @entity50 was falling apart and have long sought to win international recognition of the massacres as genocide			1
@entity54 rejects the claims , arguing that 300,000 to 500,000 @entity7 and as many @entity50 died in civil strife when @entity7 rose up against their @entity50 rulers and sided with invading @entity349 troops			1
the fundamental division was religious			0
@entity7 are @entity351 , while @entity50 are @entity352			2
the two groups had lived alongside each other for hundreds of years , but the @entity50 @entity50 had always been on top			0
as @entity50 rule crumbled , rival nationalisms arose , and the @entity358 - itself to experience revolution in 1917 - also invaded			2
@entity7 say they were forced from their homes , marched to mass graves and slaughtered			2
some managed to flee south into modern - day @entity364 and the @entity366 , others to @entity349 - held land which is now modern - day @entity47			0
hundreds of thousands met a violent end or died as they fled			0
the outcome in terms of mass death is not now widely disputed			0
but the use of the word ' genocide ' is hugely controversial , as turkey - successor to the @entity50 empire , and with a huge majority of @entity352 ethnic @entity50 - rejects the description			2
@entity47 , which became a fully - fledged nation in its modern form at the collapse of the @entity384 , has campaigned for recognition of its description of the deaths			0
its modern borders are much smaller than the areas where the deaths occurred			0
the province of @entity391 ( above ) , where the @entity239 ' roots - and the origin of their name - lies , is almost entirely in @entity54			2
its capital , @entity391 , is now a symbol of the division over the deaths between the two countries : it sits on the border but the frontier is closed .			0

in 1915 , 1.5 million @entity7 were killed by @entity50 in what historians have described as the first genocide of the 20th century
@entity2 refused to call the mass killings a ' genocide ' in official statement despite promising as a presidential candidate that he would
@entity54 officials *furiously* deny there was a genocide , and @entity2 has shied away from offending the close @entity80 ally
@entity0 - who is @entity13 on her father 's side - has called the killings a genocide and says @entity2 should too
@entity423 recently traveled to the country for the first time with her husband @entity68 , sister @entity426 and cousins @entity66 and @entity67
