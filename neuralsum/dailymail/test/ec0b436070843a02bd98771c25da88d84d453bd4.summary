@entity0 and @entity2 captain @entity1 during sunday 's all - star charity game at @entity4 @entity2 midfielder @entity0 is looking to recapture what he considers his best form in two years after recovering from injury			1
the @entity8 international enjoyed a run of 16 starts in 19 matches from late november - which coincided with a marked improvement in the team 's results - until a groin problem in february 's @entity19 derby saw him miss 10 games			1
he was an unused substitute in the defeat by @entity23 immediately before the international break , their first in the league since mid-december , but played 90 minutes in sunday 's all - star charity game at @entity4			1
@entity0 's return to fitness could not have come at a more opportune moment , with captain @entity1 suspended for three matches for his sending off against @entity23 , and the @entity32 is hoping to slot back in seamlessly after injury halted what was turning into a good season personally			1
' i was in a very good moment , probably the best moment in the last couple of years , and i had a good run of games , ' he said			2
' the beginning of the season was n't good for me because i could n't play much , but as soon as i got back in the team i think i helped a lot			1
' i do n't know if @entity48 's suspension will change things because the team were playing well , but i need to be ready and there are a lot of games to play and the @entity54 as well , so everyone will be needed			1
' i need to be ready and if i get a chance again i need to be at the same level i was before i was injured			0
' @entity0 attempts to spoil @entity60 's @entity59 's return to @entity4 with a tackle in the charity match fifth - placed @entity2 head to @entity64 on saturday knowing they can not realistically afford to lose if they are to keep pace with the top four , but in addition to @entity1 's absence they will also be missing centre - back @entity71 , a virtual ever - present this season , after he was retrospectively banned for standing on @entity23 goalkeeper @entity74			1
' @entity71 is having a fantastic season again			0
he has been a very consistent player for us and losing him and @entity48 is hard to take , but if you want to be successful you ca n't rely on one or two players , ' @entity0 told liverpoolfc.com			1
' both are very important players for us as one can change a game and the other gives us stability at the back , but we have other players as well who can step in			0
' it 's always been the case for the group that if someone gets injured then someone will step in and do the job			2
' that 's how it should be and we should n't be afraid we do n't have them			2
' of course it 's going to be a big miss not having @entity48 and @entity96 , but we have to show we can cope for the three games and then we have them back ready to go again			2
' @entity0 's spoiling in midfield helped @entity2 go on an impressive run before @entity102 the @entity32 is aiming to take advantage of @entity1 's absence in he next three games @entity0 rejected the chance to have some time off during the international break in order to make sure he was fully fit for the resumption of the @entity110			1
leading up to the @entity23 game i had a full week of training as well , so it 's been two weeks of full training , ' he said			2
' i was available for the @entity23 game , but probably was n't able to play the whole game			0
now i feel 100 per cent			0
' of course it 's good to have a few days off , but i was away in @entity8 while i was having my treatment so it was the right decision to stay here and keep working during the international break			0
' if you get too many days off you do n't get the sharpness and the rhythm of the training session and that 's what i was missing			0
' i spoke with the staff and they prepared everything for me as well to make me feel as though i 'm in good condition , so it 's looking good and hopefully it will only get better			0
' now it 's just a question of getting some minutes and training sessions , so that 's what i need and what i 'm having			0
' leading into the @entity64 game that 's going to be good , because i will have had three full weeks of training and i 'm looking forward to it			0
