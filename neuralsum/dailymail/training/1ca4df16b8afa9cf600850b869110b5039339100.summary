by @entity1 reporter published : 17:05 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 17:07 est , 26 february 2013 @entity2 may have a new brunette hairdo , but she had something of a blonde moment on sunday night when she wrongly credited the designer of her dress			2
when asked by @entity9 who had made her plunging black sequin gown at @entity13 's @entity12 viewing party , the singer , 31 , replied that it was a @entity16 design			1
in fact , though , it was a creation by @entity19 - and it was only thanks to ms @entity21 ' publicist that the correction was made afterwards			1
oops ! @entity2 told a reporter at the @entity12 viewing party that her dress was @entity16 , when in fact it was a creation by @entity19 of course ms @entity21 no doubt has a stylist to handle all sartorial matters for her - but it still comes as some surprise that she does not know which label was generous enough to loan her a garment worth at least a four - figure sum			1
@entity34 , for example , will dry clean loaned items after wearing then , sending them back to the designer with a hand - written thank - you note , revealed @entity38 who has made stage costumes for her in the past			0
at the other end of the spectrum is @entity43 , who apparently ripped and then took a pair of scissors to a borrowed gown by @entity47 earlier this month			0
a source told @entity49 : ' she said that the dress had ripped ... she could n’t possibly wear it like that - so her stylist friend went to the club bouncer and requested some scissors to repair the torn part of the dress			0
she turned it into a mullet ! ' ms @entity2 , who is newly - single after splitting from fiancé @entity59 , looked sensational at the event on sunday , which was also attended by @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			0
since her break - up , the mother - of - two is believed to have started dating a man named @entity68 who does field research for a law firm .			2

the mother - of - two told a reporter at the @entity12 viewing party that her dress was @entity16 , when in fact it was a creation by @entity19
