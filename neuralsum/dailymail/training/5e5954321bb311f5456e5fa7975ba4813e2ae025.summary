by @entity0 published : 07:37 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 06:32 est , 21 november 2013 allowances : @entity2 , 34 , should have been deported in 2006 after his temporary @entity4 visa expired but he was allowed to continue living and working in @entity4 an illegal immigrant who was twice spared deportation went on to rape a woman just months after using human rights legislation to remain in the @entity4			1
@entity2 , 34 , will finally be sent back to his home country of @entity10 when he is released from a seven - year jail term imposed after the attack in the victim ’s home			1
last night an mp said the case highlighted @entity4 ’s ‘ dysfunctional ’ border controls			2
a court heard that @entity2 came to the @entity4 on a 12 - month visa in 2005 , but when it expired he was given permission to remain on a temporary basis			1
but when @entity2 was arrested by @entity22 in december 2011 over an allegation of assault he was found to be an ‘ overstayer ’ – an immigrant who had not left the country by an agreed date			2
although no charges followed the alleged assault , @entity2 – by now married with a child – was told he would be deported			1
however , he successfully appealed the ruling , arguing that the @entity33 provided him with the right to a family life			0
@entity36 heard that @entity2 , who worked as a nightclub bouncer , was granted temporary leave to remain in the @entity4 again in january last year , after his family circumstances were taken into account			1
but 11 months later he went on to brutally rape a woman in her own home			2
bouncer : the court heard @entity2 met his victim while working as an agency - employed bouncer outside @entity49 in @entity36 town centre @entity2 , who sold mobile phone top - up cards in @entity10 before moving to the @entity4 , is thought to have lived in @entity53 before settling in @entity54 , @entity55 , where he trained as a bouncer and gained work with an agency which supplied a @entity36 nightclub			1
judges granted @entity2 the temporary right to stay in the @entity4 because he had family just days before he raped a woman in her home @entity65 , prosecuting , said @entity2 met his victim at a @entity67 ’s restaurant in the town			1
after going back to her home he attacked her , then forced her to drive him to a train station			2
@entity2 was sentenced to seven years after being found guilty of rape following a four - day trial			0
judge @entity73 told him : ‘ it was a serious aggravating factor that the rape took place in the victim ’s own home , as this was an abuse of the trust placed in you by the victim and has undermined her feelings of safety in her own space			0
’ @entity86 , @entity87 mp for @entity88 , said : ‘ this is an example of the dysfunctional border control in the @entity4			0
‘ although there has been considerable improvement since this government took over , the previous regime was completely not fit for purpose			0
‘ here is another example of someone who has gone on to commit a serious and unforgivable act when they should n’t have even been in the country at all			0
’ @entity102 , deputy chairman of the @entity104 @entity4 pressure group , said : ‘ the sensible course of action , in respect of anyone without a right to be here , is to remove them as speedily as possible			0
’ a @entity113 spokesman said : ‘ we have introduced tough new rules to protect the public from those who try to stay here through abuse of the @entity33			0
' @entity120 will give the full force of legislation to our policy that foreign criminals should ordinarily be deported despite their claim to a family life			0
' guilty : @entity2 was jailed for seven years at @entity36 after he was found guilty of rape following a four day trial last month			1
