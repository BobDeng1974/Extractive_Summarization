@entity0 , 37 , who said his reputation was destroyed when he was listed as a ' most wanted ' rapist has won almost £ 70,000 in damages a former high - flying @entity5 banker who said his reputation was destroyed when he was listed as a ' most wanted ' rapist has won almost £ 70,000 in damages from police			1
@entity0 , 37 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , was working in @entity10 when his image was wrongly released by @entity12 as one of their ' ten most wanted ' in 2010			1
he claimed the worldwide coverage left him ' unemployable ' and said the stress led to him drinking heavily and having suicidal thoughts			1
mr @entity0 sued the force and in a hearing at the @entity21 today , judge @entity19 said the release of his name and image was a breach of his human rights			1
' his details were published to the world at large , ' she told the court			2
' whilst the press release was to local media , no consideration was given to the realities of modern technology : firstly , the potential for information to spread across the internet , and secondly , the difficulty once spread in eradicating that			2
' the police lost control of the data			2
it was not on posters they could take down and photographs they could take from shopkeepers			2
' the court heard mr @entity0 had been warned by a friend that a ' malicious ' complaint might be made against him and had called @entity12			1
but he was told by officers that no such allegation had been received and thought that was the end of the matter , he said			0
he only found out about the article - alleging he was wanted and at large over an alleged rape in @entity8 - through his family			2
the article was accompanied by his address from his @entity5 days in @entity61 and a photo which had been taken when he was a dreadlocked teenager			0
mr @entity0 said the allegation was ' malicious ' and there was no need to publicise it , as he had already offered to speak to police to clear it up			1
the result was that he was left ' unemployed and unemployable ' , his lawyers told the @entity21			1
' there was a level of shock and embarrassment			0
you are defined by the career you have , ' he told judge @entity19			0
' i was financially in a very good place and that 's completely wiped out overnight			0
' it 's an allegation of a sexual assault			0
there 's a stigma attached to that which stays with you forever			0
' the fact they did n't remove these things for such a long period of time made it impossible to get back into work and rebuild my life			0
' mr @entity0 contacted the force , which ultimately agreed to have the story removed , but it had already spread via other media around the world			1
he told a hearing at the @entity21 ( pictured ) that the worldwide coverage left him ' unemployable ' and said the stress led to him drinking heavily and having suicidal thoughts he was horrified to find his name was even featured on the website of a newspaper in @entity104 , he told the judge			1
' we were having to constantly search to find these links and provide them to the police , ' he continued			0
' the fact that they were there until 2013 , three years after i contacted the police , just is n't satisfactory			0
' the stress led to him drinking heavily and having suicidal thoughts , he added			1
he sued for breach of confidence , in publishing the old photo , and for breaches of the @entity120 and a violation of his human right to privacy			0
@entity12 claimed the publication was in the public interest , but the judge said it was not ' reasonable , necessary and proportionate '			2
the judge rejected his claim that the publication directly led to him losing two good jobs - but said it had adversely affected his ability to get another			2
she awarded £ 5,000 for his psychiatric problems , £ 57,750 for loss of earnings , £ 2,000 basic damages and £ 3,000 aggravated damages			1
speaking outside court , mr @entity0 said : ' i am extremely happy that i have been vindicated and the police have finally been held to account			1
' i now feel my name has been cleared and there has been an acknowledgement that the police had done wrong			0
' had they held their hands up in the first place and given me some kind of apology , we would n't have ended up in the @entity21			0
