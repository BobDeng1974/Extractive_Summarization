prince @entity10 of @entity11 has secured statements of support from the @entity14 and prince @entity15 , a senior member of the @entity17 royal family			1
although neither of the royals will have a vote at the election on may 29 there is a history , particularly in @entity25 countries , of the ruling family influencing football policy			1
@entity5 vice president @entity10 is in the running to become the next president of @entity5 the prince sits alongside @entity32 president @entity31 during a @entity34 congress on march 4 that could be important to prince @entity10 who has struggled to win support in his own @entity39 ( @entity39 ) - only one @entity39 country , his home country @entity11 , nominated him to stand			2
it is by no means certain however that the @entity42 will back prince @entity10 despite the @entity14 offering his support			1
@entity39 president @entity44 is also from @entity45 and has already given his backing to @entity0			0
