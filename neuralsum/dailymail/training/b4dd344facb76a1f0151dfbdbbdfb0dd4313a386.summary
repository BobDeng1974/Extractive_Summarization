by @entity0 @entity1 died in her hospital bed of a massive heart attack after suffering severe internal bleeding a grandmother bled to death in the 16 hours after her operation because staff were too busy to check on her condition			1
@entity1 was admitted to @entity11 's @entity10 to have her gallbladder removed in october 2012			1
the 59 - year - old spent time on a high dependency unit before being moved to another ward where observations should have been carried out on a four - hour basis			1
but a nurse at the hospital failed to carry out the basic checks and the retired care worker suffered a massive heart attack as a result of severe bleeding the day after surgery			1
it was only when the nurse checked on ms @entity1 at the end of his shift that he discovered her lifeless , dead in her hospital bed			1
@entity31 has now paid ms @entity1 's family a five - figure sum in an out - of - court settlement after bosses admitted ' failing its basic duties of care '			1
an inquest at @entity39 last november was told the mother - of - one could have been lying dead on the hospital ward for several hours			1
a nurse failed to carry out observations on her for 16 hours and only discovered something was wrong when she was already dead			2
mrs @entity1 ’s partner @entity45 , 67 , said : ' the hospital has agreed they were in the wrong and that they did n’t provide the care they should have done			2
' i feel that to some extent , justice has been done but obviously there is no price you can put on anybody ’s life , especially @entity1 ’s			0
' the circumstances of her death left me struggling to stay in the place we were living and i had a feeling of desolation after her death			0
' mr @entity45 , who still lives in @entity64 , @entity65 , added : ' we had moved to @entity64 for our retirement and thought we ’d be there for 10 to 20 years			0
' i never expected @entity1 would die within three years			0
' ms @entity1 had decided to go ahead with the operation to deal with a painful gallbladder and was aware of the risks because of an existing heart problem			2
after the surgery , she spent time on a high dependency unit before being moved to @entity74 , where nursing observations should have been carried out			0
staff nurse @entity76 told last year ’s inquest he was too busy on his shift to check on ms @entity1 and admitted her requirements were overlooked			1
giving evidence , he said : ' at no point did i make a conscious decision not to attend to @entity1			2
' when i handed over my patients ( at the end of my shift ) , i became aware i had entirely overlooked @entity1 ’s needs and requirements and went to check her and it was at that time i discovered no signs of life			2
' the inquest heard how staffing concerns had been previously raised on the @entity74 ward , where ms @entity1 died			1
mr @entity76 had been caring for ten of the 28 patients on the ward at the time			0
@entity11 deputy coroner @entity96 criticised the treatment and described the situation as ' shocking '			0
the 59 - year - old was admitted to @entity11 's @entity10 to have her gallbladder removed in october 2012			1
but after being moved back to the ward following surgery ms @entity1 the nurse in charge of her care failed to make the standard four - hour checks , discovering her dead in bed at the end of his 16 - hour shift recording a narrative verdict the coroner said staffing was a national crisis that needed to be addressed			1
she said : ' it goes without saying this is something the trust needs to prioritise to avoid tragedies like the one we have heard about today			0
' to miss or delay one observation is one thing but to have no observations in an entire 12 - hour shift and no notes at all is nothing short of shocking			2
' it ’s clear he ( mr @entity76 ) felt overwhelmed and i have some sympathy in that respect			0
' staff nurse @entity76 failed to provide the medical attention @entity1 needed			2
' @entity132 , chief executive of @entity31 , said : ' we reiterate our sincere and unreserved apologies to the family for failing our basic duties of care and letting ms @entity1 and them down			1
' i feel that to some extent , justice has been done but obviously there is no price you can put on anybody ’s life , especially @entity1 ’s ' - ms @entity1 's partner @entity45 ' whilst no amount of money can undo the distress the family have experienced as a result of this tragic case or compensate for their loss , we hope the settlement provides some financial security for the future			1
' the family received the five - figure sum compensation after taking their case to clinical negligence lawyers @entity162 and @entity163			1
solicitor @entity164 , who represented mrs @entity1 ’s family , said : ' evidence heard at the inquest raised grave concerns about the quality of care @entity1 received and the processes that were in place at the @entity10			1
' it is clear that @entity1 ’s tragic death was wholly avoidable			0
it is simply not acceptable that she was left to bleed to death on a hospital ward and it is important those responsible were held to account			0
' despite their loss , @entity1 ’s family have been determined to remember her as the popular , happy , much - loved woman that she was			2
' they now hope that important lessons are learned from the events that led to her death and that this will prevent other families suffering a similar tragedy in the future			0
' mr @entity45 said @entity1 , who had one son , @entity193 , 41 , had been ' well - liked ' by everyone she met			0
