by @entity0 published : 09:31 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 14:12 est , 27 november 2012 @entity1 took the decision to abort her unborn baby after losing her first son just weeks away from his due date			1
she has now developed an extreme phobia of pregnancy a woman suffering with an extreme phobia of pregnancy had an abortion because she was too scared to have her baby , despite being desperate for a child			1
heartbroken @entity1 , 24 , from @entity15 , had the termination just weeks eight into her pregnancy			1
her phobia was triggered by the horrific loss of her first baby son five weeks before he was due to be born			1
in a devastating twist , the young woman had been forced to deliver the stillborn baby , after doctors said he ' suffocated ' in the womb			2
she is speaking out after a new report found as many as one in six women could be affected by tokophobia – a severe fear of pregnancy and or childbirth			2
it even suggests some sufferers are going as far as inducing miscarriage , seeking sterilisation or terminating their pregnancy like miss @entity1 did			1
the @entity39 said : ‘ i know lots of people wo n’t understand			2
i was desperate to be a mother but was simply too terrified to continue with the pregnancy			1
‘ as soon as i found out i was expecting i started suffering with anxiety and panic attacks			2
' deciding to end the pregnancy was one of the hardest decisions of my life but i knew there was no way i could get through it without having a breakdown			2
‘ i left the clinic in tears , heartbroken , but also relieved that i did n’t have to go through pregnancy and birth			2
i really felt like i had no choice			2
' i hope this new report helps people understand what women like me go through			2
’ according to experts there are two main types of the condition			2
primary tokophobia relates to childless women who have a morbid fear of pregnancy or birth and have consequently never been able to have children			2
secondary tokophobia affects women who have experienced a traumatic pregnancy or birth experience , which leaves them too emotionally scarred to have more children			2
miss @entity1 said she had always dreamed of becoming a mother and was delighted when she fell pregnant in 2007			1
her pregnancy went smoothly , but at 34 weeks she realised she had not felt her baby move for several hours			1
because he was usually so active she and partner @entity79 30 , grew concerned and called their doctor			1
miss @entity1 had first been forced to bury her son , who died in her womb after she suffered undiagnosed pre eclampsia , in a shallow grave			1
she and partner @entity79 then moved him to a family tomb at the time they were living in @entity90 and just weeks away from moving back to @entity15 to prepare			1
she said : ‘ when staff at the clinic told me to make my way in i was more concerned that our baby might arrive early			2
i did n’t for a moment consider there was anything seriously wrong			2
’ but an ultrasound revealed devastating news - their son had died			1
she said : ' i remember the doctor shaking his head and saying ‘ he ’s gone			0
’ i did n’t understand what he meant			0
' i was due to give birth so where could my baby have gone ? then it hit me that he meant dead			1
i just could n’t take it in			0
' unbeknown to her she been suffering with pre-eclampsia , which leads to dangerous high blood pressure , water retention and protein in the urine of expectant mothers			0
although the cause is not known , it is though to be linked to the placenta , which provides oxygen to the baby while it is in the womb			0
she said : ' the doctor matter of factly said my son had most likely suffocated inside @entity132 was horrified			1
hours earlier we ’d been on top of the world planning our future , now our baby was dead			0
’ just moments later miss @entity1 was told she would have to deliver her son who they had named @entity140			1
she said : ‘ i was in shock			0
but i could hear my partner remonstrating , saying that i was in no state to give birth and they needed to do a c section			1
’ ‘ we had to wait in the clinic for an operating theatre to become available			0
all around me were pregnant women , some in labour			0
’ six hours later she was taken into theatre			0
‘ when i came round i looked down at my empty stomach and just started screaming for my baby			0
‘ i kept sobbing " i want my boy , bring me my boy , " but nobody offered to get him for me			0
' hospital staff later brought her her son , but would not let her hold him			1
miss @entity1 first fell pregnant while living in @entity90 , and her pregnancy had run smoothly , until 34 weeks she had been nearly full term when she lost her son @entity140			1
the harrowing experience which followed left her with a condition called tokophobia - which makes her petrified of giving birth she said : ' i wanted to hold him but they refused so instead i stroked his cheek and held his tiny little hand			1
and then after a few moments he was gone again and that was it			0
’ there was no offer of footprints or a lock of hair to cherish as is routinely offered to grieving parents in the @entity183			0
instead , in line with local tradition , their son was to be buried within 48 hours			1
she said then followed a ' nightmarish experience ' in which she and her partner arrived at the cemetery to find there was no plot prepared			1
instead @entity79 was forced to dig his own son 's grave helped by a group of local family members with spades			1
the priest even refused to say a prayer because @entity140 had not been baptised			0
later that night miss @entity1 suffered a breakdown			1
the next morning the couple returned to the cemetery to gently retrieve their son 's casket themselves and take him to a family plot nearby			1
they washed the coffin down with bottles water , wrapped it in blankets , before taking it by car to a family plot to lay @entity140 to rest next to his late paternal grandfather			0
this is a scan of @entity140 , the couple 's stillborn first child			1
the experience left miss @entity1 so traumatised , she aborted her second child weeks later she moved back to the @entity183 to be with family and friends , but was haunted by nightmares and flashbacks			1
she said : ' i tried to focus on the thought he was resting now , but the nightmares were constant so i started counselling			2
’ both miss @entity1 and her partner still wanted to become parents and she even hoped another child might help ease her pain			1
but when a year on she learned she was pregnant again she was suddenly engulfed by fear			0
‘ i wanted a baby , but all i felt was terror			0
my fear it would go wrong again was overwhelming			0
‘ i was suffering panic attacks , constant anxiety and dread			0
i was petrified that the same thing would happen again			0
‘ seeing pregnant woman or tiny babies would set me off			0
‘ we ’d also been told the pre eclampsia could come back and i just knew then that i could n't go ahead with the pregnancy			0
‘ no matter how much i wanted a baby i was simply too frightened			0
’ miss @entity1 had always considered herself anti abortion , but as each day of her pregnancy passed it started to feel like her only escape from the daily terror			1
initially she said was afraid of admitting to her partner that she wanted a termination , scared he would not understand but in the end her phobia made the choice for her and , supported by her partner , she booked a termination at eight weeks			1
miss @entity1 said she did not regret her decision : ‘ it would have pushed me over the edge			1
the fear was so great it would have finished me			0
i did the right thing at the time			0
after a visit to her gp to discuss her fear of pregnancy , she was prescribed antidepressants , but after several months decided to stop taking them			0
it ’s been three years since miss @entity1 's termination and she said she is now considering trying again after receiving counselling for her phobia			1
she said : ‘ @entity79 has been a saint he really has but i know he wants us to start a family and so i ’m doing my best to get my head in the right place			0
‘ some days i think it might be possible			0
other days i imagine leaving hospital without a baby again and it leaves me terrified			2
‘ maybe the report will lead to women like me being offered more help and support			0
i want to overcome this phobia with all my heart and i know that i will			0
it ’s just a question of when			0

@entity1 , 24 , lost her first son just weeks before he was due to be born
she was desperate for a child , but terrified of going through the distress again
she terminated her second child at eight weeks - but after counselling she and her partner are now considering trying for another
