by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 put his personal problems behind him on thursday as he started his bid for glory at the @entity6 at @entity7			1
the @entity8 only announced his split from his fiancee , tennis star @entity10 , on wednesday but he was immediately back in action at the @entity13 's flagship event			1
@entity2 was four under after 15 holes of an opening round interrupted by storm delays and sits six behind early leader @entity14			1
centre of attention : all eyes were on @entity2 at @entity7 after he split up from @entity10 one to watch : spectators surrounded the third green to get a look at @entity2 in his opening round local knowledge and a fierce determination not to drift into obscurity paid massive dividends for former @entity7 resident @entity14			1
@entity14 hailed the best round of his entire career after carding a brilliant 62 courtesy of eight birdies and an eagle , a round completed just moments before the first of two suspensions of play due to the threat of lightning			1
' i was signing my scorecard when the siren went and @entity43 looked at me and says , ' you 're not having a very bad day , are you ' ? " @entity14 said			1
' we could kind of feel there was something going on in the weather , so it was nice to get in			2
' at 10 under par , @entity14 held a two - shot lead over @entity53 's @entity52 , with @entity55 's @entity54 six under and @entity56 and @entity58 winner @entity57 another two strokes back			1
@entity56 could need as little as a top - 30 finish this week to replace @entity61 as world no 1 , the @entity64 beginning the @entity65 with a one - over - par 71			2
@entity14 missed the cut in last week 's @entity67 and feared the worst in a tournament that has produced just one top - 10 finish ( in 1998 ) in 16 previous appearances			1
out in front : @entity14 leads the tournament after shooting a stunning 62 in his first round ' you shoot great rounds in your career but to shoot 62 on this course , you ca n't ask for more , ' said @entity14 , who went on to win the @entity78 in 2011 the last time he shot 62 on the @entity13			1
' i do n't really know where to start			2
last week was awful and i was starting to feel a little frustrated with things			2
practice this week , i was not good either			2
' to step out on this course of all courses and play like i did today was surprising			2
although i lived here for nine years it 's not a place where i think it 's going to be a great week , but i have to stick my head down now and focus on the rest of the week			2
' pin - point accuracy : this approach to the 18th set up a birdie for @entity14 - the eighth of a stunning opening round @entity14 reigns in the rain : the umbrellas were up as @entity14 holed out to complete his first round @entity14 , who looks set to qualify for his first @entity99 appearance since 2002 , birdied the second , fourth and seventh to reach the turn in 32 before a superb scoring burst on the back nine			1
the 43 - year - old birdied the 10th and 11th and holed from just six feet for an eagle on the par - five 12th , before picking up further birdies on the 14th , 16th and 18th			0
wet and wild : the rain hammered down at @entity7 as play was suspended twice asked to explain his renaissance after falling out of love with the game five or six years ago , @entity14 added : ' hard work			1
determination to not let a golf career fade away			0
' i 've just been determined to get myself to where i can play with the best in the world and i 'll keep continuing to do that as long as my body allows me to			0
' i enjoy being out here , which i probably did n't do for a couple of years			0
' it 's very easy when you get past 40 to stop enjoying this after a long career			0
i have travelled with my golf clubs since i was 14 years old and sometimes you forget why you love the game and it becomes hard work			0
' ruled out : @entity131 has been forced to withdraw from the tournament with a knee injury after an opening round of 73 @entity14 is currently third in the @entity99 qualifying race but added : ' i still think i need to do a lot more			1
there 's a lot of guys playing great golf at the moment and over the last few weeks a few names are all starting to come back into the frame			0
' i 've watched a lot from the sidelines ( he has been vice-captain three times ) and that can hurt a little bit , but i wanted to play in another @entity99 and i 've got to stay focused and determined to keep playing good golf to get there			0
' @entity52 's round was twice disrupted by the bad weather , but the 27 - year - old - who won the @entity155 as an amateur in 2009 - was not about to say a bad word about the tournament			1
' i love it around here , ' said @entity52 , who was fourth in 2011 and 12th last year			0
' it 's a great event			0
it 's a great golf course			0
' i 've been struggling and my best finish this season was last week , tied 15th in the @entity67			0
' i 've missed a few cuts and have n't really been putting that well but i managed to find something at home a couple of weeks ago and hopefully can keep it going			0
' i went back to an old putter that i used years ago and it brought back good memories maybe			0
' a knee injury meant that @entity131 had retired from the tournament after opening with a round of 73 , one over par , this morning .			1
