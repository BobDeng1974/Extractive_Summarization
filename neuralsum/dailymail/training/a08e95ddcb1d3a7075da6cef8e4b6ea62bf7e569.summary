by @entity0 fears are growing that @entity2 could remain in a ' persistent vegetative state ' for the rest of his life even if he wakes up from his coma			0
the @entity8 legend has been in intensive care since his skiing accident in @entity11 nearly four weeks ago			1
he was placed into an artificially induced coma shortly after the crash to help his brain heal , but such measures normally last only a maximum of two weeks			1
@entity18 - @entity17 , professor of neurology at the @entity20 , said : ' every day , every week in a coma the chances decline that the situation is improving '			1
one @entity25 website reported @entity2 , 45 , may suffer from @entity26 or persistent vegetative state			1
his wife @entity39 insists her husband is a ' fighter ' who will not give up but his family insisted he was a ' fighter ' as they poured out their heartfelt thanks to fans around the world on his webpage on tuesday			2
' we all know : he is a fighter and will not give up ! ' said his family , adding : ' we are deeply moved that there is no let up in the good wishes for @entity2 from around the world			1
' that gives us strength			0
thank you all of you ! ' but the support of his wife @entity59 , 44 , his two teenaged children , brother and closest friends can not mask the fact that 23 days in an artificial coma means that he is far from anywhere near recovery			2
a persistent vegetative state is one in which patients with severe brain damage are in a state of partial arousal rather than true awareness			0
' deeply moved ' : @entity2 's @entity71 and brother @entity72 arrive at @entity73 earlier this month			1
his family have issued a heartfelt thank you to fans around the world for their support strain : @entity79 and their children have been maintaining a constant bedside vigil since his crash this means that if doctors do bring him out of his artificially induced coma he would be unable to speak , move or feed himself			1
the format.at news website said ; ' more than three weeks after the tragic skiing accident of the seven - time @entity89 champion @entity2 , hope dwindle for a full recovery			1
' for more than three weeks now @entity2 lies in a medically induced coma at the @entity93 in @entity73			1
he is fed there with probes , washed daily and moved again and again to avoid a bed sores			0
' probe : investigators at the site of @entity2 's crash earlier this month where he smashed his head on a rock while skiing off - piste in @entity103 , @entity11 it goes on to speculate that the ' severe damage ' he suffered to his brain in a ski accident on december 29 could result in the permanent vegative state suffered by around 10,000 of his @entity110 countrymen			2
this would mean , if and when he is brought out of the coma by his medical team , ' that his condition would hardly be different from the medically induced coma '			1
@entity26 is always the result of a severe brain injury			2
the chance of recovery from @entity26 are far below 50 per cent			2
' @entity2 's condition remains stable but there is a firewall of silence from his medical team about the intense battle being waged to try to bring him back to normality			0
get well soon ! @entity128 and @entity129 stars hold out a banner wishing @entity2 good health @entity26 - or persistent vegetative state - occurs when a patient with severe brain damage remains in a state of partial arousal rather than true awareness after waking from a coma			2
patients can breathe on their own and circulate because their brainstem remains intact , but they are largely unresponsive to stimulation			0
the chance of recovery from @entity26 are far below 50 per cent			0
there is no treatment , but a person can live for many years with the right medical care			0
brain injury patients are placed into artificial comas to reduce the amount of oxygen that flows into the brain , thus making it work less and giving it time to heal			0
such comas usually last for a maximum of two weeks , although there have been instances of patients being under longer			0
as @entity2 enters his fourth week in such a state neurological experts are starting to doubt whether he might ever recover sufficiently to be brought out of his sleep			0
meanwhile , his family have paid tribute to @entity164 sides @entity128 and @entity129 on the @entity8 legend ’s official website			1
players from both sides held up a banner which read ‘ @entity170 ! you can do it , @entity2 ’ prior to their friendly on saturday in honour of the 45 - year - old @entity110 , who is a @entity128 supporter			0
the message from the seven - time champion ’s family is the first in over a fortnight and comes just days after it was confirmed that he is in a stable condition at @entity73 .			1

@entity8 legend has been in a medically induced coma for nearly four weeks
neurologist : ' every day the chances decline that situation is improving '
@entity25 media speculate that seven - time champion has @entity26
@entity192 says they are ' deeply moved ' by support from fans around the world
