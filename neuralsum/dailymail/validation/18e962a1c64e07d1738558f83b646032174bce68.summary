it 's well accepted that the bars preferred by backpackers offer cheap drinks and the chance to meet like - minded future @entity6 friends , but @entity7 is offering up a whole new experience			1
@entity11 's only @entity10 - listed building has been transformed into a youth hostel where worldly travellers can spend a night behind bars in the cells previously occupied by hardened criminals			1
bookings open this week ahead of the opening of the hostel following a renovation of the famous institution 's @entity21 which took nine months			1
bookings open this week for the @entity7 , a youth hostel in @entity11 's only @entity10 - listed building perfectly manicured lawns have replaced the dirt - covered yard that prisoners would have used for exercise in the former jail a combination of new and old is found at the @entity33 's new short - term accommodation the @entity33 's women 's division has been transformed from a place for incarceration to a haven for young travellers @entity7 spokeswoman @entity39 says the launch of the hostel will be the culmination on five years of planning for a project that almost did n't get off the ground but that it is now ‘ one of the most unique accommodation options in the country ’			1
the north - western complex of the prison was built in the 1850s and originally served as the cookhouse , bakehouse and laundry but the closure of @entity57 meant a place was needed to keep female prisoners			0
they were transferred to @entity7 and the wing was secured by an extra wall to keep them in , with varying results			0
and as @entity11 ’s criminals increased with the population , the division was further extended until it was rendered redundant by the building of the specialist @entity70 in 1970			2
the entire prison was closed in 1991 and its historic status has since been confirmed and honoured by @entity73 , a blessing and a curse as far as the hostel is concerned			0
inspection time at the cells will take on a whole new meaning when the @entity7 opens soon a double bunk fits perfectly in this rather luxurious cell formerly occupied by law - breaking women hangings , floggings and some famous escapes once took place in the prison soon to be filled with smiling faces the @entity33 's cookhouse before being devoted to women has extensive stainless steel food preparation facilities ‘ the status as a world heritage site added many challenges to the development , which was shelved a number of times before finally receiving approval in april 2014 , ' @entity94 says			1
building approval was officially given the green light the following month			0
the prison itself was built by convicts between 1851 and 1859 , and was consequently referred to as the @entity33			2
it remained a prison for 136 years until it closed , with the @entity21 part of the property used as education facilities by @entity111 from 1993 to 2009			2
@entity33 was built by convicts from 1851 - 1859 and the majority of original features have been preserved throughout the facility reminders of the history of the prison , from past inmates to renowned escapees , are found throughout the halls a tribute of sorts on the wall honouring @entity124 , an escapee who climbed onto the roof and then perimeter wall to get out in 1931 a recreation of a typical cell that would have been home to a @entity7 inmate around 1855 the @entity33 's entire complex serves as a popular and award - winning tourist attraction in its own right only a small overhaul was needed - and allowed due to the heritage listing 's restrictions - to turn the prison into short - term accommodation which @entity94 says is ' as prison - like as it is comfortable '			1
the walls , floors , windows and bars in some case retain the feeling of a place where you could be locked in with the key thrown away , but additional facilities have also been added to bring the hostel in line with its competitors			0
for those who do n't like the idea of being behind bars , the @entity158 - style guards ’ cottages outside the front gates are a more luxurious option			0
the women once locked away in this wing would have usually ‘ offended the good order ’ of society , with the most common offences including ' vagrancy , loitering in public places , drunkenness , obscenity , soliciting , running a brothel , being idle or having no visible means of support ' .			0

@entity33 is @entity11 's only @entity10 - listed building
the former @entity21 section has become @entity7
the youth hostel has been renovated to be ' as prison - like as it is comfortable '
