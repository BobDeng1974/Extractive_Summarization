with a net worth of £ 3billion , there are plenty of things sir @entity4 can buy with his money			1
but his plans to explore the depths of the ocean have had to be put on hold , almost four years after the entrepreneur unveiled the @entity12 submarine in april 2011			1
sir @entity4 , 64 , originally wanted the 18ft - long vessel to make its first voyage 36,000ft down to the bottom of the @entity18 ’s @entity17 - the lowest known point on @entity20 - before 2012			1
after the @entity18 dive , the plan was for the craft to move on to @entity29 's 28,000ft deep @entity28 trench , followed by @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity33 ocean dives , reported @entity48			1
@entity12 - which had launched under the promise of ‘ five dives , five oceans , two years , one epic adventure ’ - was said to have planned to charge ‘ aquanauts ’ up to £ 300,000 for the trip			1
but the @entity56 company told @entity48 reporters @entity58 and @entity59 that the submarine could only be used for one dive because of the huge pressure on its structure			1
tests found its cockpit showed signs of cracking under the simulated pressure of a 38,000ft depth			2
and in a statement on @entity75 's website in august , when he admitted defeat for the moment , sir @entity4 said : ‘ we are still highly passionate about exploring the bottom of the ocean			2
underwater : it was hoped by sir @entity4 that his deep sea exploration would break as many as 30 @entity82 , including the five deepest dives in history down it goes : on his planned journeys to the bottom of the sea , sir @entity4 was expecting to spend up to 12 hours in complete darkness and freezing cold in the submarine 's tiny cockpit ‘ however , we are now widening the focus of the project and looking for new technology to help us explore the ocean and democratise access at reduced cost and increased safety			2
’ @entity12 then confirmed last week that the project had been ‘ put on ice while we look at other technology that works ’ , adding that it was hopeful of reviving it at some point			1
virgin spokesman @entity106 told @entity107 today : ' @entity4 is planning to develop a submarine technology that will reach the bottom of the ocean multiple times			2
in an ideal world this sub would take a pilot and two passengers			0
‘ we remain committed to the exploration of the deep seas but it will take time to find and develop the right robust technology to reach the bottom of the ocean with the same craft many times			0
’ it was thought the deep sea exploration could have broken as many as 30 @entity82 , including the five deepest dives in history			0
on his planned journeys to the bottom of the sea , father - of - two sir @entity4 was expecting to spend up to 12 hours in complete darkness and freezing cold in the submarine 's tiny cockpit			0
successful : two years ago , @entity134 director @entity133 made it down to the @entity17 in a solo descent in the @entity138 submarine , taking more than two hours to reach the bottom fatal crash : @entity40 's experimental space craft disintegrated over the @entity143 desert when its feathering system deployed prematurely and aerodynamic forces tore it apart the eight - foot long craft , made of carbon fibre and titanium , had stubby wings and a cockpit			1
it was said that it could cruise for about six miles and stay submerged without help for 24 hours			0
sir @entity4 had planned to take it in turns with @entity159 sailor @entity158 to pilot the submarine			0
mr @entity158 is carrying on with the project and sir @entity4 has the option to do a dive with him			0
two years ago , @entity134 director @entity133 made it down to the @entity17 in a solo descent in the @entity138 submarine , taking more than two hours to reach the bottom			0
that was only the second manned expedition to the depths - the first was in 1960 when @entity173 lt @entity172 and @entity175 oceanographer @entity174 spent 20 minutes on the ocean floor			0
in october , @entity40 's experimental space craft disintegrated over the @entity143 desert when its feathering system deployed prematurely and aerodynamic forces tore it apart			1
co-pilot @entity179 was killed in the accident and pilot @entity181 was seriously injured but managed to escape after activating his parachute system .			0

@entity184 unveiled @entity12 sub in 2011
wanted 18ft vessel to make its first voyage 36,000ft down before 2012
but idea has been ' mothballed ' two months after @entity40 crash
