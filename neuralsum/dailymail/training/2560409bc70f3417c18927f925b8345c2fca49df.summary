a woman who was mauled by a tiger was in a staff area of the enclosure that animals should not have had access , it has emerged			1
@entity7 , 24 , died when she was mauled by a @entity9 tiger at @entity10 , in @entity11 , @entity12 , on friday afternoon			1
detective chief inspector @entity13 , of @entity14 , said : ' it is vitally important that we discover what exactly happened in the big cat enclosure building that led to @entity7 coming into contact with the tiger			1
police have now ruled out possibility zookeeper @entity7 , pictured on a night out , committed suicide this picture from @entity25 's @entity24 was posted on her @entity26 days before she died ' i want to emphasise there is no suggestion of any foul play or any issue of suicide or self - harm from the enquiries we have made and evidence we have			1
' what has become apparent from our enquiries is that @entity7 was going about her routine duties and was in the staff section of the enclosure building , which animals are not allowed access to , when a tiger has entered it from an adjacent pen and confronted her			1
' the tiger has then attacked @entity7 , taking her from the building into the open - air external enclosure area where @entity7 was left and later attended by staff and paramedics			1
' we are still trying to establish exactly how and why the tiger has been able to get from the pen into the staff area and at the moment believe this to be because of a human or system error , or mechanical failing , or combination of both			2
' a spokeswoman from the park confirmed that @entity7 was in the staff area of the tiger enclosure			1
she said : ' we concur with the recently released @entity14 statement who are acting for the coroner in compiling the evidence in accepting that @entity7 was in the keeper work area at the time of the incident			1
' the door of the tiger den was wide open and the slides to the outdoor area left open			2
this allowed the tiger to enter the housing and sadly attack @entity7 as she was right by the den door			1
' it is now clear that @entity7 did enter the tiger den at some point to clean the den by opening the door but the exact circumstances of how the slides to the outside enclosure were left open is unclear			1
' miss @entity7 was described as a happy , bubbly woman who loved her job at the animal park zookeeper @entity7 pictured ( far right ) with her boyfriend @entity90 ( far left ) at the wedding of her brother @entity92 ( third left ) to @entity94 zoo owner @entity95 said neither the park or the tiger was to blame for the death of keeper @entity7 miss @entity7 died after being attacked by a tiger at @entity10			1
one of the park 's tigers is pictured @entity7 was located in the inner corridor of the enclosure , an area that tigers should not have access to as the sliding doors to the inner tiger pens should have been bolted shut			1
instead , a tiger was able to drag her from the corridor , through the left pen and out to the outside area were she was killed			2
she added that the usual procedure was not followed on the day			0
she said : ' it is protocol not to open any door of a den until all slides are confirmed closed and padlocked and all animals confirmed not in the dens and secured in the outer area			0
' for some reason this did not happen resulting in this tragedy			0
' at the time of the incident it was not thought there was any reason that day to enter the tiger facility hence previous versions of events			2
' we are convinced that this was not anything but an accident caused by human error			0
the park has insisted that the equipment was in full working order at the time of the incident , but said that @entity7 was one of the ' family '			1
she said : ' the public were never in danger and the park was given the all clear to re open within hours of the incident once mechanical and procedural issues were checked for failure by the local authority and the police investigations team			0
' we wish to conclude by stating that @entity7 was one of our family here , she was talented and special			1
our sincere and heartfelt condolences go to her family			0
' her brother @entity154 , 27 , has reacted to the statement , saying that the park director @entity95 is blaming @entity7 for the incident : @entity7 , 24 , was in the staff area of the enclosure when the tiger got in to attack her he said : ' he 's laying the blame squarely at her door before the official police inquiries have begun			1
it has caused hurt to our family			0
' yesterday @entity154 said there was ' no way ' his sister would have wanted the animal to be destroyed as she loved big cats			0
it comes as police say they do not suspect suicide or foul @entity175 said the family had also been hurt by suggestions by the park 's owner , @entity95 , that she had died because of ' keeper error ' and a ' sad error of judgment ' , the @entity177 said			0
' these are unsubstantiated claims by a man with an obvious axe to grind , ' he said			0
' my family and i feel his comments are ill - advised , premature and disrespectful			0
' he 's laying the blame squarely at her door before the official police inquiries have begun			0
it has caused hurt to our family			0
' he also told the @entity201 : ' it is not the tiger ’s fault			2
it is just an animal that did n’t know what it was doing			0
' i do n’t want it to be put down			0
@entity7 would n’t ever have wanted that			1
' in a statement yesterday ms @entity7 's family thanked the efforts of the emergency services and said asked people to donate to a fund for the conservation of red squirrels in her memory			2
@entity14 believe an elaborate enclosure of gates means the animals and its keepers should remain apart at all times - but this system failed with fatal consequences			2
the @entity228 was closed after @entity229 was mauled in the enclosure , during one of the tiger 's ' starvation ' days detectives do not suspect foul play or suicide but say ms @entity7 was doing her routine duties in an enclosure to which animals are not allowed access - when she was then confronted by the animal which somehow managed to gain access to the pen			1
officers are now trying to establish whether this was due to a technical fault or human error and have said there is no suggestion of foul play or issue of suicide or self - harm			0
writing on the park 's @entity26 page , mr @entity95 said : ' we have made a statement that from the investigations that have taken place it is clear that this tragedy was caused by a sad error of judgment and breach of protocols , in essence , keeper error			2
' this is not blame , it is not anything but defining the facts as they appear			0
' this does not mean @entity7 killed herself on purpose it means simply she died from her own tragic mistake			2
' miss @entity7 suffered ‘ very traumatic ’ head and neck injuries in the attack and went into cardiac arrest			1
although resuscitated by paramedics , she died in hospital			0
keepers are required to enter the enclosures in the course of their duties			0
but each one contains a number of compartments and an elaborate system of gates which should mean the animals and their keepers remain apart at all times			0
park owner @entity95 said miss @entity7 was a happy , bubbly girl who was good at her job police outside the @entity299 in @entity11 , @entity12 @entity10 in @entity11 was closed early after the attack one of the tigers at the @entity10 , which was not involved in the attack days before her death , miss @entity7 changed her @entity26 picture to a still from the 1991 @entity25 animation @entity24 , which shows a portrait in ribbons after being slashed by claws			1
after miss @entity7 entered the enclosure on friday , staff heard a scream over the radio and ran to the scene , where they found the two tigers on top of her			1
park owner @entity95 , 42 , said @entity317 , the male @entity9 , had instigated the attack			2
he added that at the time @entity317 and @entity319 were on what is known as a ‘ starve day ’ , when they are not fed – to mimic conditions in the wild where tigers may go for some time without catching any prey			0
‘ the males are twice the size of the females and @entity317 had taken control , ’ mr @entity95 said			0
he fired two shots with a rifle to scare away the animals , but miss @entity7 , who lived with her boyfriend in @entity334 , had already suffered serious injuries			1
detective chief inspector @entity13 said : ‘ there is no suggestion of any foul play or any issue of suicide or self - harm from the enquiries we have made and evidence we have			0
‘ what has become apparent from our inquiries with witnesses is that @entity7 was going about her routine duties and was in the staff section of the enclosure building , which animals are not allowed access to , when a tiger has entered it from an adjacent pen and confronted her			1
miss @entity7 ’s family yesterday praised paramedics and hospital staff for ‘ valiant efforts ’ to save her life , adding : ‘ we are still coming to terms with what has happened			2
