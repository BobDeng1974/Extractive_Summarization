by @entity0 published : 05:43 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 09:11 est , 18 january 2013 retirement is meant to be about getting out the pipe and slippers			2
77 - year - old @entity4 appears to have understood the slippers bit but there is certainly no sign of a pipe as he balances like a gymnast on the frozen parallel bars in -25 ° c as part of his daily exercise regime			1
amazingly since starting the workout more than ten years ago , the retired teacher from @entity16 , in north eastern @entity17 , says he has rarely caught a cold			1
freezing : 77 - year - old retired teacher @entity4 from @entity16 , in northeastern @entity17 , has exercised like this everyday for more than a decade			1
the only reason he wears gloves is to stop sticking to the frozen bars straighten that back : @entity4 pulls his legs up to the horizontal position and crunches those abs. that back could be a bit straighter though			1
7/10 slippers together : @entity4 drops the legs and lifts them out behind him , transferring weight on to his arms			1
8/10 brain freeze : incredible balance shown by @entity4 as he headstands on a snow covered stone			1
that 's one way to wake you up in the morning			2
those legs should really be pulled in together though			0
6/10 he starts his regime with a light jog to get the blood pumping , then he does some lifts on the parallel bars and finishes off with a dip in the frozen water			1
mr @entity4 said that he does morning exercises all year round since retiringand and has never missed a day			1
@entity17 male employees usually retire at the age of 60			0
the images are reminiscent of the @entity57 video and images posted online earlier this year of a 4 - year @entity17 boy jogging and doing press - ups in the snow			0
the boy 's father , who was behind the exercise regime said his son was born several months premature and doctors worried he might suffer development difficulties so came up with a harsh regime to build the boy ’s strength and mental toughness the clip begins with a shot of the boy , named as @entity75 , standing in the snow in clear distress			0
he is then shown walking , fists clenched against the cold , past parked cars covered in several inches of snow			2
at one point he begs : ‘ please give me a hug			0
’ @entity85 up : @entity86 swings round the bars like a 21 - year - old gymnast			0
9/10 fit as a butcher 's dog : not an ounce of fat on @entity4 as he lifts himself up on the bars to display perfect symmetry			1
9/10 headrush : once again , @entity4 goes for the headstand as the sun comes up in the distance			2
legs could go a good six inches further back though			0
5/10 clearing the path : @entity4 finally gets into something a bit warmer to prepare the jetty for his final exercise of the morning his mother can apparently be heard laughing and encouraging him to endure the icy ordeal			2
one viewer wrote : ‘ the child would be better off in care			0
this father is a monster			0
’ but online comments from a woman described as the father ’s assistant said the child had agreed to run in the snow : ‘ this child has received all sorts of forms of training since he was small			0
’ she said the father ‘ does n’t care what others say ’ , adding : ‘ the fact that the child lived shows he has tenacious vitality			0
’ cooling off time : : @entity4 peels off the pants and prepares to get into the frozen water , no doubt it will cool him right down after that workout sub-zero : @entity4 finishes his routine with a quick dip in the water			1

@entity4 exercises in his pants and slippers in -25 ° c
he then goes for a dip in frozen water yet never catches a cold
he has done same workout since retiring more than a decade ago
