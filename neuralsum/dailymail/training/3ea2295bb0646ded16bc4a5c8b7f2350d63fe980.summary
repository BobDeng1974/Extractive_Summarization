by @entity0 published : 07:03 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 20:50 est , 18 november 2013 @entity1 died aged just 10 months old after going on his first foreign holiday to @entity3 with his mother @entity4 , 24 a baby who fell ill on a flight to his first foreign holiday died hours later from suspected meningitis			1
ten - month - old @entity1 became poorly after arriving in @entity3 with his mother and grandparents			1
after appearing hot , lethargic and sleepy on landing , he was seen by the hotel doctor who recommended he go to hospital			2
but once there his condition deteriorated and despite the best efforts of medical staff he went into cardiac arrest and died			2
last night his mother @entity18 , 24 , urged parents to be vigilant and told how the disease struck with shocking speed			1
she said : ‘ we could n’t believe that such a healthy , advanced , happy , little boy could be gone with hardly any warning			2
you truly would n’t believe it unless you had been unfortunate enough to have experienced a similar situation			2
‘ @entity1 was such a happy little boy who was always laughing and giggling			1
no one expects to go on holiday and come back without their baby			2
’ the tragedy occurred last month as @entity33 , a bank clerk , waited at @entity34 with her parents , @entity36 and @entity37 , to board their plane			2
suddenly @entity1 was sick but the family presumed it was down to the change of routine and the fact he had just drunk a whole bottle of milk			1
he fell asleep on the plane but when he woke he appeared grumpy and soon fell back to sleep again			0
mrs @entity18 of @entity49 , near @entity50 , said : ‘ once we arrived in @entity3 i fed @entity1 another full bottle and he again seemed tired , grumpy and lethargic which we thought was due to the fact that he ’d been woken in the night and was still catching up on sleep			1
@entity4 had been shopping before the holiday on october 6 and had bought @entity1 sunglasses and a hat ( left ) ‘ at the hotel i fed @entity1 his baby food jar which he ate half of before falling asleep again and i began to think there was something not quite right			1
‘ i dug out my thermometer and realised he had a temperature and i ran a cool bath			0
he was very floppy and needed holding up in the bath			0
’ the hotel doctor was called and he recommended they go to hospital			2
within half an hour they were in a children ’s ward			0
@entity4 said her son had been sick and grumpy before boarding the flight at 6am , but she put this down to the change in his usual routine and the fact that he had drunk a bottle of milk @entity1 slept through most of the flight and it was only when @entity4 arrived at the hotel she began to think that something was wrong when she struggled to wake him up the hotel doctor recommended @entity1 be taken to hospital but said it was ' nothing serious '			1
however , when @entity1 arrived his skin became blotchy and he struggled to breathe before dying shortly after there are two types of meningitis , bacterial and viral			1
bacterial is the most dangerous because it can cause septicemia - or blood poisoning , which can be fatal			0
most people know to look out for a rash which does n't fade when pressed against a glass - but this is a later symptom and does n't always appear			0
in babies and very young children , early warning signs include being floppy or unresponsive , vomiting or refusing food , and being very sleepy and reluctant to wake up			0
the child may also develop a staring expression , pale or blotchy skin , and be irritable and not want to be held			0
other symptoms can include having unusually cold hands and feet , blue lips , shivering , and pain in muscles or joints			0
if you detect any of the above symptoms with a fever , you are advised to call 999 immediately and request an ambulance			0
later symptoms are drowsiness , confusion , seizures , sensitivity to bright lights , rapid breathing , and a rash			0
viral meningitis can still be serious , but usually has mild flu - like symptoms			2
@entity1 ’s hands , feet and ears were turning slightly blue and were very cold even though he had a high temperature			1
he had also developed tiny , blackhead - like spots around his mouth			0
he was placed on a drip and a heart monitor but appeared frustrated and began wriggling and getting tangled in the wires			0
mrs @entity18 – whose self - employed husband , @entity141 , had stayed at home to work – said : ‘ @entity1 ’s whole face had turned a purple colour and he had developed big red blotches all over his head			1
‘ the nurses immediately began giving him oxygen via a mask and told us they needed to take him straight to intensive care			0
when my dad and i went to see @entity1 , his whole body was red with big white blotches			1
‘ i stayed alone with @entity1 for a while singing , talking and kissing him before the doctor came to examine him and told me to leave the room			1
' i could hear the machines beeping and nurses rushing in and out and they informed me it was n’t good , that he was unstable and they were massaging his heart			0
' within 15 minutes the doctor returned to tell us his heart had stopped and he had unfortunately passed away			0
i could n’t believe it			0
’ a post-mortem examination was carried out in @entity3 and the results are still unavailable , although @entity169 doctors believe @entity1 died of meningococcal septicaemia			1
the family flew back to the @entity169 three days later and want to raise awareness about the disease by raising funds for charity			0
the family have set up a fund for @entity178 in remembrance of @entity1 and want to raise as much money as possible to fight the disease			1
@entity1 was also on holiday with his grandfather @entity183 ( right )			1
his father , @entity141 , was unable to come because he is self - employed and struggles to get time off work the tragedy happened after @entity4 agreed to join her parents @entity36 ( left ) and @entity37 ( right ) for a @entity189 tournament @entity4 had been looking forward to taking @entity1 to @entity3 on his first every holiday abroad ( file picture )			1

@entity1 died aged just 10 months old while on holiday
mother @entity4 , 24 , took him to @entity3 with her parents on october 6
however within hours the boy was rushed to hospital after becoming ill
he died later the same day of suspected meningitis
