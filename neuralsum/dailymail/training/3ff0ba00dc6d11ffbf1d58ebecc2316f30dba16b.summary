by @entity0 published : 08:06 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 09:17 est , 12 november 2013 a mother - of - one with a cyst the size of a bowling ball on her uterus has overcome the debilitating condition to reach the finals of a curvy modelling contest			1
@entity10 , 37 , from @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , was misdiagnosed by doctors who thought she was suffering from @entity15			1
over 15 years her condition continued to worsen , leaving her writhing in pain for hours at a time			2
after multiple consultations she decided to go ahead with an abdominal hysterectomy - the removal of her uterus and ovaries - to restrict the pain			1
the procedure was painful and frightening for @entity38 but since the surgery she has found a new lease of life and felt confident enough to enter herself into the ' @entity43 ' competition by fuller - figure lingerie firm @entity44			1
she 's , of course delighted to find herself in the final			2
@entity10 , an administrative assistant , said : ' every job i had i was in fear of losing because i was almost always late due to the fact i was incapacitated			1
' i looked normal and healthy on the outside but inside i was losing a battle			0
by october 2012 i was in danger of losing a job for the third time and the pain was the worse it had ever been			2
' after a trip to hospital and several large doses of painkillers - none of which worked - i accepted i would have to start the process of doctors , tests and medication again only this time i demanded certain things be done			2
@entity10 found it hard to walk , could hardly eat and had to struggle throughout the day and night ' later that month after requesting an mri i was told i had @entity71 and cysts on my ovaries , @entity69 is a granular tissue disease - they do n't really know what causes it and there 's no cure			1
' the uterus haemorrhages within the muscle and since it ' in the muscle it does n't shed , causing it to grow becoming larger and heavier			2
' i was basically walking around with a small bowling ball in my pelvis			0
the weight of it was crushing my other organs and creating the digestive issues because the colon was in impinged			0
' in the end they had to remove my entire uterus , ovaries and had to separate everything from my colon			1
i lost three organs including my gall bladder			0
' one doctor also told me i was very lucky because had i waited much longer organs would have started to shut down			0
' now recovering from her the ordeal @entity10 says her confidence - although a work in progress - is starting to come back			1
she added : ' i feel like i get to start over - i was quite upset about feeling ' incomplete ' as a woman and no longer having the option to make another baby which i really wanted			2
she was diagnosed with @entity28 - for which there is no known cure , and had multiple consultations ' but then i looked in the mirror , the colour in my face had started to look healthier and i 'm able to sleep through the night			1
it 's the little things most people take for granted that i had to focus on			2
' my daughter @entity119 is my blessing and my miracle			0
she has helped me to stay focused and love myself just as she does			0
' it was that which gave me the energy to take a few minutes to put on eyeliner or lipstick or even put a little effort into my hair			0
i look in the mirror and i do n't see less of a woman , i see a warrior , a survivor and a woman who still has much to explore			0
' i decided to enter the competition because i loved that it was about real women & curves all shapes and sizes			1
i thought , how cool would it be to see a model i can relate to so why not me ? ' i do n't see women who are my shape and size and @entity44 has such beautiful designs so i started to envision myself as a @entity145			0
@entity10 decided to go ahead with an abdominal hysterectomy to restrict the pain , and she has now been chosen as a finalist for fuller - figure lingerie firm @entity44 's annual ' star in a @entity43 ' competition ' it 's an opportunity of a life time - i had nothing to lose and everything to gain			1
quite frankly i was feeling rather confident and i felt that this would help me to continue focusing on the positive and moving forward			0
i want to be a role model why not a lingerie model as well			0
' a spokesman for @entity44 , said : ' the world is made up of different shapes and sizes and we feel not all sizes are represented			0
' we want all our customers to feel that they are being catered for and that being above a @entity166 cup and curvy is something to be proud of			0
' voting for the next @entity43 in a bra begins today and ends at midnight on november 19			1
the winner will be announced on november 21 and will gain a 12 - month modelling contract with @entity44 and a year 's supply of @entity44 lingerie			1
