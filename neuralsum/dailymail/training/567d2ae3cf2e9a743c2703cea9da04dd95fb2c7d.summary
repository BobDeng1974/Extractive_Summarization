by @entity0 published : 08:53 est , 17 december 2012 updated : 09:25 est , 17 december 2012 he may be off to live in the lap of luxury but 4.4m long croc ' shrek ' was n't particularly keen to move home			0
as up to five members of staff at @entity8 in @entity9 prepared to transport the notoriously ill - tempered croc to a new world - class enclosure , he decided to show them who was boss			0
despite being given a good scrub down and having his teeth brushed in preparation for the move , the 400kg salt water managed to wrestle free from handlers and swung his head so ferociously that he gave one park ranger a black eye			1
you are coming with me : shrek finds out he is moving home when a ranger ties him up and film crews arrive easy does it : slow progress is made as handlers remove @entity25 from his pool spa treatment : handlers set to work on @entity25 , giving him a good scrub before taking him to his new home croc manicure : handlers give @entity25 a once over , checking his claws are trimmed and all is in working order gagged : handlers prepare to give @entity25 's huge teeth a good clean pearly white : a scrubbing brush is used to clean @entity25 's teeth			1
no toothpaste in sight , mind strength : despite having five handlers on his back , blindfolded , gagged and tied down with a rope , @entity25 manages to free himself enough to swing his head , knock over a handler and give him a black eye the crocodile was christened @entity25 because he is big , green and looks like an ogre and he certainly lived up to his name			1
@entity70 @entity69 was headbutted twice by the reptile as he freed his head as five handlers tried holding him still			2
mr @entity69 told @entity73 that it was painful but that it could have been a lot worse			2
' of course it hurt ' , mr @entity69 said			0
' when a 400kg crocodile swings its head at you with all its strength it tends to hurt			0
' ' a lot more people die on our roads than get killed by crocodiles , " he said			0
@entity25 is off to a state - of - the - art enclosure at @entity89 wildlife park in @entity90 , where he will have his own pond			1
mr @entity69 , 65 , was in charge of transporting the 400kg saltwater crocodile from @entity9 's @entity8 to the @entity95 in @entity90			2
later that day , once he was brought under control , @entity25 was flown to @entity97 on a @entity99 passenger jet and then trucked to @entity89			0
not happy : @entity25 attempts to throw the handlers off of his back over he goes : park ranger topples over as @entity25 lashes out headbutt : @entity25 's head catches gamekeeper as he falls to his feet			1

@entity25 is *reluctantly* off to a new luxury enclosure in @entity90
despite five handlers holding him down he wrestles free
he headbutts park ranger @entity69 and gives him black eye
