by @entity0 @entity1 has been scolded by the boss of @entity3 after claiming the station ’s music made travelling in @entity6 lifts ‘ hell ’			1
the @entity9 presenter was told he should ‘ take the stairs ’ if he did not like tunes from the youth music station piped into elevators			1
in a terse email fired off by @entity3 controller @entity16 , the 63 - year - old was also asked to keep his outspoken views under control			1
@entity9 presenter @entity1 , who has been scolded by the boss of @entity3 after claiming that listening to the station 's music while he was in the lift was ' hell ' mr @entity16 , who has been in charge of @entity3 since 2011 and is paid £ 161,600 a year , responded within hours of reading @entity1 ’s remarks earlier this week			1
his email , which has been seen by the @entity25 , was copied to other senior managers			0
it said : ‘ @entity28 , i read with interest your views on @entity3 and @entity32			1
i am controller of both			0
‘ clearly you are entitled to your view , but please consider who and what you effect [ sic ] when you express those views			0
’ just in case @entity1 was in any doubt as to how much he had angered senior management , mr @entity16 – who said he is a fan of @entity9 – added : ‘ if all this falls on deaf ears then my only other suggestion is to take the stairs			1
’ the row came after @entity1 launched an astonishing attack on the @entity6 this week , calling his employer ‘ smug ’ , criticising the payoff scandal and claiming it ‘ distorts the marketplace ’ with its news operation			2
but it was his attack on @entity3 that ruffled the most feathers at the corporation			2
radio 1 boss @entity16 wrote an email to @entity1 inviting him to ' take the stairs ' after the @entity9 presenter said listening to the station 's music in lifts was ' hell ' he said : ‘ there ’s a pile of stuff on the @entity6 i ca n’t stand			1
my idea of hell is going down in one of the lifts in that ghastly new building [ @entity70 ] in a lift which has @entity32 plumbed into it			2
i do n’t quite understand why the @entity6 does @entity32			0
‘ i do n’t really understand why it does @entity3			2
clearly , you can meet those needs commercially			0
’ however , mr @entity16 defended his stations and said the @entity6 ’s commercial rivals are unable to provide a comparable service			2
he said : ‘ commercial radio targeted at young listeners does not win awards for documentaries about domestic abuse in teenage relationships , it does not have two 15 - minute news programmes in its daytime output listened to by more young people than watch the 10 o’clock news , and it does not play 65 hours of specialist music a week			1
’ he added : ‘ if the licence fee is collected from everyone , then the @entity6 should represent the whole of society , not just certain parts of it			0
’ it is understood @entity6 senior management are increasingly frustrated by stars who criticise the corporation in public			0
radio 4 presenter @entity101 has claimed the @entity6 is ‘ grotesquely over-managed ’ and had a ‘ broadly liberal ’ bias , while @entity104 host @entity103 said it was ‘ too big for its own good ’			0
however one @entity6 source said : ‘ the problem is , we hire people like @entity1 because they are outspoken and they know their own minds			1
we do n’t want a bunch of yes men in news and we ca n’t tell them to shut up			0
but it would be nice if they stopped biting the hand that feeds them			0

@entity1 said listening to @entity3 music made travelling in lifts ' hell '
radio 1 boss @entity16 emailed @entity9 present inviting him to ' take the stairs '
