the echoes of departed spirits often show up on camera when those in shot were unaware of their presence			2
but , as this spine - chilling video shows , sometimes the undead are more than capable of making their presence felt			1
it purports to show the startling moment that a phantom pushes a man to the floor before seizing hold of his leg and dragging him along a deserted corridor			1
the minute - long clip , which emerged online , shows footage of unknown provenance shot on a @entity39 camera which captures a hoodie - wearing gentleman striding purposefully along a deserted corridor			1
with few signs of life in the stark , clinical - looking corridor , it is already an eerie scene , but hardly looks like the kind of place where the dead might visit			0
the clip is silent , presumably since the surveillance camera on which it was shot has no microphone			1
as the man reaches the end of the corridor a forbidding shadow - like apparition materialises ahead of him			1
the terrified victim is continued to be dragged across the ground by his foot man and ' ghost ' appear to be locked in a tussle on the floor as the victim tries to get on his feet his previous confidence evaporates as he is knocked to the ground by the spectral assailant			1
before he can react , it snatches hold of his left leg , dragging him along on his back			0
the victim of the supernatural attack , whose identity is not known , must have thought his days were numbered			2
he may have feared he would spend the whole of the rest of eternity in a pit of hellfire			0
but without warning , the wraith relinquishes its grip and , as quickly as it materialised , it dissolves			0
terrified , its victim , scrambling to his feet , flees in the very direction he has just come from			1
the ' ghost ' releases its grip and the hooded man is left lying on his back on the floor he then struggles to his feet , still shocked by his supernatural experience the video 's origin is unknown , but it has made its was to @entity94 where it has received nearly a million views on one channel			1
commenters were mixed in their opinions as to its authenticity			0
@entity103 wrote that she fell victim to a similar supernatural attack as a teenager			2
' i saw this dark entity looking at me with red eyes , ' she wrote			0
terrified , he runs back in the direction from which he came not wanting to repeat the experience not looking back , the victim , caught on @entity39 , continues to run for his safety ' i tried to run but it grabbed me and dragged me back in my room			1
i passed out i did n't know what happen after that all i know is that i wake up running to my older sister and scratching her uncontrollably			0
' but others dismissed it as a ultimately flawed attempt at amateur computer - generated imagery			0

you did the wall well , but pay that in mind on the next attempt			0
