the 62 - year - old had previously been admitted to @entity15 and sectioned under the @entity16 after murdering two people in 1983			1
his motive , @entity26 heard , was to avoid being moved to another facility which did not allow smoking and did not have wifi			0
sentencing @entity8 to a whole - life order today , mr @entity31 told the victim 's family he would never be released			1
' obviously that man will never be released			0
' let us hope that he does not kill someone else in some other setting when he does not get his own way			0
' it comes as it was revealed the 62 - year - old was serving a double life sentence for the murders of two people in 1983 when he killed the nurse			1
after serving 16 years behind bars , the mental patient was admitted to the notorious high security hospital for men , @entity15			1
hospital chiefs have admitted they have ' no idea ' how psychiatric patient @entity8 smuggled the @entity22 's kitchen knife ( pictured above ) into the facility on the morning of mrs @entity57 's death , he was seen calmly smoking a cigarette in the hospital 's yard			1
moments later a knife had been plunged into the nurse 's back			1
she was pronounced dead shortly afterwards , after beginning rounds in the hospital ward			0
questions have been raised over whether the nurse should have been working alone at the time of the attack			1
' the practice was that when the night shift ended and the day shift started , what was supposed to be a pair of healthcare assistants would check the patients were in place and well , ' said @entity79			0
' there was some doubt as to why @entity11 was going through that process on her own that day			2
' following her killer 's sentencing , detective chief inspector @entity83 said authorities were still at a loss as to why he murdered the ' compassionate ' nurse			2

@entity98 , chief executive of the @entity99 , said searches would be beefed up at the ' low secure ' @entity101 at @entity9			0
it comes as staff admit they still do not know how @entity8 smuggled the murder weapon into the hospital			1
' what we know for a fact is we have no idea where the knife came from , ' mr @entity98 said			2
' our policies previously were in line with many other organisations ’ policies but we feel at this stage now , in the light of what has happened , that it would be appropriate to enhance those further			0
' while it is not known how @entity8 brought the weapon into the facility , he had fashioned a plastic sheaf to contain it , the court heard			2
the 62 - year - old is said to have brought the blade into the facility in november 2013 - some nine months before using it to kill mrs @entity57 , his lawyer said			1

' on the day of the attack it was the very same day he was going to be moved to that hospital			0
' the day before he did make specific mention that he would not be going			0
' and that is why i do not believe that @entity11 was the targeted individual he wanted to murder			2
' she just happened , unfortunately , to be the wrong person in the wrong place at the wrong time			1
' he added the case had struck a chord with investigators working in the public sector			0
' with myself and the investigation team this whole incident really hits home in the heart because as public servants we all come into work in the morning , we can hopefully do the best we can do			0
' but we all go home to our families and @entity11 ’s family do n’t have @entity11 coming home any more			0
' relatives and colleagues have paid tribute to the nurse , describing her as ' one in a million '			0
' we would like to thank everyone for their support and such kind words that have been said about @entity11			0

@entity194 is an 88 - bed acute mental health hospital near the centre of @entity10 which provides inpatient services for the county			1
while chiefs say it is predominantly a hospital , one unit - in which @entity8 was being treated - has a security fence			1
those held in low secure units can include patients previously admitted to high or medium secure units , the chief executive of 2gether @entity99 said			1
@entity207 said security would be beefed up at the hospital in @entity19 ( pictured ) where mrs @entity11 was described as a ' compassionate and amazing ' nurse chilling footage of @entity8 smoking a cigarette in the yard of the mental hospital where he was a patient moments before killing nurse @entity11 has emerged			1

no more than a minute afterwards , he is believed to have plunged a @entity22 's knife into the 53 - year - old 's back twice			1

chilling : the schizophrenic murderer was seen smoking a cigarette outside in the hospital 's yard just moments before plunging a kitchen knife into the back of nurse @entity11 it helps such patients ' move down through medium secure and low secure before being discharged , ' said @entity98			1

' during the investigation , we have focused a great deal on how the weapon used in this crime was on the @entity276			0
