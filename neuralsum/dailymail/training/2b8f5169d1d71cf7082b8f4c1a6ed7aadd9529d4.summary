by @entity0 published : 06:12 est , 29 november 2013 @entity2 : 07:26 est , 29 november 2013 the young wife of a @entity5 rabbi died in hospital from an undiagnosed stomach ulcer - just weeks after giving birth to their sixth child			1
@entity11 , 33 , had complained of sickness in the weeks before and after the delivery of baby @entity14			1
after being sent home from hospital following the birth , she was readmitted only to be discharged again despite her husband rabbi @entity19 fearing his wife , ‘ was n’t the complaining type ’ and was still very poorly			1
@entity11 ( pictured with her husband , rabbi @entity21 and four of their children ) , 33 , died five weeks after having her sixth child when she suffered a perforated stomach ulcer which led to septicaemia and eventually to multiple organ failure mrs @entity11 , whose grandparents helped found jewish outreach activities in @entity30 and @entity31 , was sent back to @entity32 after her sickness continued and she lost weight			1
she died a month later			2
tests showed mrs @entity11 had a perforated ulcer which had not been detected by doctors but which caused septicaemia and led to multiple organ failure			1
at an inquest in @entity40 , rabbi @entity11 wept as the hearing was told there is an ‘ inherent ’ difficulty in detecting diseases in the stomach or intestine when a patient has recently given birth - as symptoms can be attributed to the after - effects of delivering a baby			1
doctors could not have detected the symptoms any sooner			2
mrs @entity11 - known as @entity54 and described as ‘ very well liked and very well respected ’ - was originally from @entity55 in @entity56 but moved to the @entity57 in 2005 with her @entity40 born husband			1
he headed a synagogue in @entity61 , @entity62 , and ran the 60 pupil @entity63			2
during her lifetime mrs @entity11 was said to be dedicated to promoting @entity5 life and the mission of @entity68 – an organisation which helps promote @entity70 and provides @entity72 lectures			1
mrs @entity11 complained of sickness before and after the birth of her sixth child but was discharged from hospital when her condition started to improve and tests did not reveal any abnormalities after marrying her husband she had given birth to her first five children @entity87 , now 13 , @entity83 , 12 , @entity84 , 10 , @entity85 , seven , and @entity86 , two			1
but problems arose after the delivery of @entity14 in august 2010			2
following the birth tests performed on mrs @entity11 at the hospital ’s emergency unit on august 29 showed everything appeared normal and despite her vomiting , she was discharged on august 31			1
dr @entity95 said : ‘ she spent the weekend in the emergency unit and according to nurses notes she was stable throughout			2
there was intermittent vomiting through the night and day but it stalled			2
‘ on august 31 , i was asked to review the patient to see what the plan was			0
her blood pressure was normal and she had been able to eat			0
mrs @entity11 ( pictured with her family ) returned to hospital when she started vomiting again and lost weight			1
in hospital her condition continued to deteriorate and she could not be saved ‘ i thought maybe the best the best place for her was home given that there had been no changes throughout the weekend			1
she was stable and ambient			0
’ during the hearing rabbi @entity11 ’s lawyer @entity114 said he was concerned that his wife had no energy and was very listless			1
but dr @entity118 added : ‘ the sheer effect of reduction in nutrition would have accounted for her lack of energy			0
if a patient was presented in the same circumstances today i would follow exactly the same procedures			0
‘ over and above being a doctor , i am a human being , and i would like to offer my sincere condolences			0
’ mrs @entity11 ( pictured as a teenager ) has been described as ' very well liked and very well respected ' dr @entity132 , a consultant physician in acute medication said it was not necessary to carry out an abdominal examination			2
‘ because vomiting had stalled and she was eating she should go home , ’ he said			0
‘ i saw mr @entity19 and explained this			0
she seemed well when i saw her and she was mobile			0
‘ if she was n’t keeping down food i would have kept her in , but the notes i have are that she was eating			0
i know she was n’t an “ in your face ” type person but that ’s why i arranged to see mr @entity19			0
if there had been no improvement i would n’t have sent her home			0
’ mrs @entity11 was discharged at around midday on august 31 but readmitted on september 3 where she was described as suffering ‘ profound septic shock ’			1
a coroner recorded a verdict of death from natural causes			1
mrs @entity11 is pictured as a child her condition again deteriorated on september 9 and by this time , surgeon professor @entity158 said there was evidence of organ damage where the septic state had begun to impact on the function of her organs			1
professor @entity158 said : ‘ the examination of the abdomen in women who have recently given birth is one of the old chestnuts in surgery as you can miss small diagnoses like acute appendicitis when they have not long given birth			2
‘ we do n’t understand why that is but most expert doctors have seen something like that			0
‘ even if there had been something subtle there , the chances of you identifying something with a single abdominal examination are really small			0
you would have passed it as being normal and there is a risk you would have missed perforation			0
’ an inquest into mrs @entity11 's death heard she could not have been diagnosed earlier as it is very hard to spot stomach conditions in women who have recently given birth rabbi @entity11 ’s lawyer @entity114 said : ‘ there has been significant concern from the family that she was n’t eating and was n’t holding down food			1
‘ you have a lady who was quite passive and did n’t complain			0
we think that may have been interpreted as she was ok and improving			0
’ but recording a verdict of death by natural causes , @entity40 coroner @entity202 said : ‘ it is obviously a complete tragedy that you have a woman of 33 years old who is a mother of six and it deserved the fullest investigation and that is why i have gone to the trouble of consulting medical experts at public expense			1
‘ at the end of the day , i would hope you understand you have had a full enquiry and matters have been looked at carefully			0
my deepest sympathies are passed on and i know this brings back terrible memories			2
’ family friend rabbi @entity221 , of @entity223 's @entity222 , said : ' @entity11 was reserved , gracious and very @entity224 - fearing and built a beautiful family ' speaking after the inquest , rabbi @entity11 said : ‘ i did think that the medical care was not perhaps up to par at the time but everything has been followed up and today has clarified the care was up to the correct standard			1
i want to thank the coroner and the medical staff for their incredible work			2
’ a collection of memories of mrs @entity11 by family and friends , as well as her own childhood journal entries , have been posted on a blog @entity242 family friend rabbi @entity221 , of @entity223 ’s @entity222 , said : ‘ @entity11 was reserved , gracious and very @entity224 - fearing and built a beautiful family			1
‘ she was an aristocrat of the spirit , but at the same time very devoted and always behind her husband in the running of the shul and the school			0
she sacrificed a tremendous amount for these communal organisations			0
