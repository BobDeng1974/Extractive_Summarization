‘ my wrist had started to get uncomfortable , so i decided to get it checked out , ’ said @entity0 as she looked at the piece of paper in front of her , @entity0 massaged her fingers and puzzled over the spidery , illegible writing			1
as a personal assistant , she relied on her ability to take accurate , concise notes and was proud of her neat handwriting			0
yet the words she ’d just written were no better than a scrawl			0
‘ i ’d start writing as normal , but within just a few words , it would fade into little more than a scribble , ’ says @entity0 , 42 , who lives in @entity15 , @entity16 , with her husband @entity17 , 64 , an engineer			1
‘ it was as if my hand would just stop working			0
‘ i ’d also been having trouble typing , hitting the wrong letters — previously , i ’d been able to touch type accurately at high speed			0
’ initially , @entity0 blamed the problem on tiredness from long working hours and her commute into @entity30 to work at an energy company			1
but after six months of suffering these symptoms , she made an appointment to see her gp			2
‘ my wrist had started to get uncomfortable , so i decided to get it checked out , ’ she says			0
‘ at the time i was 36 , so i did n’t suspect anything sinister , but i could n’t ignore something that affected the skills that were so intrinsic to my work			2
' if i could n’t write or type , how could i continue to be a pa ? ’ her doctor diagnosed repetitive strain injury ( @entity48 ) in the wrist , caused by typing and writing over 20 years , and told her there was nothing they could do			1
‘ i accepted the diagnosis without question , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ it seemed to make perfect sense given my line of work			0
’ @entity48 is an umbrella term for pain in the muscles , nerves and tendons caused by repetitive movement and over-use			1
it is extremely common — research shows as many as 73 per cent of people who use a computer at work experience it , with an estimated 200,000 cases of work - related musculoskeletal complaints in the hand , wrist , arm , elbow , shoulder and neck last year alone , according to official statistics			2
typical @entity48 conditions include carpal tunnel syndrome , where a nerve in the wrist becomes compressed			2
other common causes include tendonitis ( inflammation of a tendon ) or tenosynovitis ( inflammation of a tendon sheath )			0
@entity0 began to experience tremors in her leg 18 months after being diagnosed with @entity48			1
‘ i ’d also started having difficulty with simple tasks , such as brushing my teeth , so i began to get concerned , ’ she said since there is no test for @entity48 , diagnosis is usually made on the basis that the condition developed following a repetitive task and is relieved by resting from it			1
but experts warn that the term @entity48 is increasingly being used as a blanket diagnosis , and could mask other more serious conditions , such as rheumatoid arthritis , multiple sclerosis ( @entity109 ) , diabetes and even @entity111			1
that ’s because the early signs of each of these conditions are so similar to @entity48 that doctors often consider it first			1
for example , with diabetes , long - term poor management of blood sugar levels ( often because the condition has n’t been diagnosed ) can lead to tingling , numbness and pain in the fingers — all symptoms of @entity48 , too			1
‘ the term @entity48 is really very vague , ’ says professor @entity125 , a consultant orthopaedic surgeon			2
‘ because it covers such a wide range of ambiguous symptoms , it is easy to see how doctors can attribute them to the condition when they are , in fact , indicative of something else entirely			0
‘ the most common are rheumatoid arthritis and @entity109 , but it could be a different neurological condition , such as @entity111 ’s , or diabetes			1
’ ‘ the consultant seemed to be taking it far more seriously than 18 months previously , ' said @entity0 he says that when @entity48 is suspected , and particularly where there is pain but no sign of injury , such as inflammation , swelling or problems with nerve function , this should be the starting point of investigations to pin down the root cause			1
‘ i do n’t think that to simply identify that a patient has pain and accept it as a condition in its own right is helpful , ’ says professor @entity125 , visiting professor of sports science at the @entity151			0
he says that once the specific cause has been worked out , each individual condition that may be put under the umbrella of @entity48 is ‘ absolutely treatable ’			1
‘ however , the term “ @entity48 ” is so nebulous , treatment is very varied depending on the root cause of the pain			2
in fact , i think the term should be banned			0
‘ the key is getting an accurate diagnosis , with all therapists and doctors working together to treat the problem , rather than just accepting it			0
’ @entity0 ’s was a classic case of @entity48 misdiagnosis			1
after seeing her gp , she tried her best to ignore her symptoms , typing more slowly to maintain her accuracy and using a ruler to keep her writing straight			0
but 18 months later , she began to experience tremors in her leg , so returned to her gp			1
‘ i ’d also started having difficulty with simple tasks , such as brushing my teeth , so i began to get concerned , ’ she says			2
after walking and writing tests at the gp surgery , she was immediately referred to a neurologist at the @entity187 in @entity188 , near where she lived at the time			0
‘ the consultant seemed to be taking it far more seriously than 18 months previously , but they still did n’t give me any indication of what it could be , ’ says @entity0			1
she was sent for an @entity197 on her brain , which was normal			2
a week later , she had a @entity200 scan , which determines the level of dopamine in the brain — this chemical plays a vital role in regulating movement			1
lack of dopamine is characteristic of @entity111 , causing tremors , slowed movement and stiff , inflexible muscles			1
the @entity200 scan confirmed that @entity0 did have @entity111 ’s , and she was put on medication to slow the progression			1
but four years since her correct diagnosis , she has had to give up work			0
‘ i ca n’t write very well or type any more , and i tend to stammer and drop things , but i can honestly say i have a better quality of life , ’ she says			0
‘ before , i was working long hours and felt permanently stressed — now , i can spend time with my husband and relax and enjoy life			0
‘ i ’m chairman of our village hall committee and run a saturday food market , which keeps me busy			0
' my symptoms are very mild and progressing very slowly , so i consider myself lucky			0
’ ' my symptoms are very mild and progressing very slowly , so i consider myself lucky , ’ said @entity0 @entity0 also insists she has no anger or animosity towards the gp who misdiagnosed @entity48			1
‘ it ’s notoriously difficult to diagnose @entity111 ’s in its early stages — and even if i had been diagnosed earlier , it ’s unlikely it would have made any difference to the progression of my illness			1
it ’s an easy mistake to make			2
’ indeed , it can be difficult for any @entity229 to pick up on the wide variety of symptoms of @entity111 ’s , says professor @entity243 , a neurologist and clinical director of the charity @entity245			1
the problem is that many of its symptoms , such as loss of smell , constipation , a frozen shoulder and spidery writing , can be signs of other conditions			0
and they can appear up to a decade before motor symptoms , such as a tremor , slowness or rigidity of movement			0
@entity261 is another patient whose @entity48 turned out to be something far more serious			2
eleven years ago , she went to her gp after her grip inexplicably became weaker — she needed help using a knife and fork to cut up her food			0
having been diagnosed with @entity48 , she was referred to a physiotherapist for strengthening exercises			1
‘ my job involved working on a computer a lot , so i accepted what i was told , ’ says @entity261 , 35 , a translator and media analyst from @entity272 , @entity273			0
‘ but within three years , my symptoms had progressed quite significantly and i ’d gradually lost all sensation down my left side , starting in a small area of my leg and then spreading from my toe to my shoulder blades			2
’ she adds : ‘ that lasted for three months			2
but then i went back to my gp and was referred to a neurologist , who sent me for an mri scan			0
’ after further testing , she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis			0
this affects nerves in the brain and spinal cord , causing a wide range of symptoms , including uncontrolled muscle movement , balance and vision problems and fatigue			0
‘ it was n’t until that point that my neurologist looked back at my history and said the first episode of “ @entity48 ” was likely to have been @entity109 , ’ says @entity261 , who volunteers for the @entity301 and other charities			2
‘ i now know that the symptoms of @entity109 can easily be attributed to other things if you look at them in isolation , so it ’s easy to ignore them or accept that it ’s something else			0
’ @entity111 ’s @entity316 runs from april 20 to 26			1

at 36 , @entity0 was diagnosed with repetitive strain injury ( @entity48 )
but 18 months later , she began to experience tremors in her leg
she had a @entity200 scan , which determines the level of dopamine in the brain
lack of dopamine is characteristic of @entity111 ’s *disease*
it confirmed she had @entity111 ’s , and she was put on medication
