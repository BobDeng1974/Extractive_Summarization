he travelled the country during the independence referendum , proudly defending the @entity3 while standing on upturned @entity5 crates			1
but @entity7 's fondness for @entity9 's ' other ' national drink means that taxpayers have been forced to fund his habit – handing over the princely sum of £ 1.30			1
@entity15 bosses have uncovered two claims from the @entity17 in his @entity19 expenses following a freedom of information request , it emerged today			1
@entity22 in @entity9 @entity7 has claimed @entity5 on expenses under existing rules , mps – who earn £ 67,000 - a - year - are allowed to claim for non-alcoholic drinks during overnight stays			1
mr @entity7 , who does not drink alcohol , is a huge fan of @entity5 and purposely chose to tour the country with the branded crates as he visited 100 towns and cities in 100 days before the referendum			1
he endured heckling from @entity35 voters and was hit with eggs while speaking in @entity37 , @entity38 , sparking claims that independence campaigners were ' orchestrating a campaign of intimidation '			2
his expenses claims were both ridiculed and criticised yesterday			1
a spokesman for pressure group @entity45 said : ' this is ludicrous and will leave taxpayers fizzing with rage			0
expenses are supposed to be to help mps do their job , not for caffeine - heavy refreshments or pr stunts			2
' an @entity54 spokesman said : ' @entity17 's bottle has crashed and this is a further embarrassment for @entity7			1
unlike @entity9 's favourite national soft drink – he is neither ' original ' nor ' best '			1
' nationalist politicians took to @entity58 to mock the @entity17 leader , with @entity61 minister @entity60 posting a picture of himself drinking @entity5 with the caption : ' pleased to say i always buy my own @entity65			2
' @entity67 @entity66 joked : ' i can not believe that story about @entity7 claiming for @entity5			1
i had no idea he even liked the stuff			0
there were no clues to this			0
' a @entity17 spokesman said : ' as most people know , mr @entity7 drinks bucket loads of @entity5			1
over the years it 's thought that he has single - handedly kept the @entity79 @entity5 supplier in business			1
he has paid for it himself except for these two cans totalling £ 1.30			0
' mr @entity7 was involved in heated confrontations with independence supporters on his 100 towns in 100 days tour of the country , where he spoke from an @entity5 crate the freedom of information request was spotted by the team at anti-establishment blog @entity92			1
( @entity94 ) in response to the unknown individual who requested the information , the @entity95 wrote : ' under the @entity99 ' scheme of business costs and expenses , mps may claim for the cost of purchasing food and non-alcoholic drinks where they have necessarily stayed overnight neither in the @entity107 area nor their constituency			1
this is limited to £ 25 for each night			0
' mps may also claim reimbursement of the costs of an evening meal ( excluding alcoholic drinks ) , when they are required to be at the @entity79 because the @entity79 is sitting beyond 7.30pm			2
this is limited to £ 15 for each night			0
@entity5 has been described as @entity9 's ' other ' national drink ' in processing your request , we have searched through all claims made by @entity7 mp for food and drink for any which identify @entity5			1
we have identified two such claims			2
both claims were made before april 30 , 2014 , and amount to £ 1.30			0
' a spokesman for @entity5 makers @entity129 declined to comment			2
the revelation comes just weeks after it emerged that @entity54 msp @entity131 charged taxpayers for his £ 1.80 bill in an @entity135 fish and chips shop			0
originally , only the price - tag was released by parliament bosses , sparking a hilarious guessing game on social media about what he bought for the paltry sum			0
now , a @entity145 request by the @entity9 @entity146 has finally revealed what mr @entity131 purchased at the @entity148 chippy			2
an order for ' small chips ' was made at 10.43pm in april 2013 , the receipt shows , which the @entity67 - who earns nearly £ 59,000 - a - year – later took the time to formally submit to @entity156 authorities , where it was processed by taxpayer - funded staff			0
expenses documents show that mr @entity131 , a @entity67 , is fond of his takeaway dinners			0
as well as claiming for chips , he clawed back a £ 5.40 bill from the @entity163 on four occasions in 2013 - 14			0
and seven other receipts for an evening meal were submitted from an unknown restaurant or takeaway , each priced just £ 4.20			0
an @entity54 spokesman said : ' members are permitted to claim some money towards meals on evenings when parliamentary duties mean they must stay in @entity135			0
' the claim of £ 1.80 is in line with the @entity15 allowances system , which has already been reformed and has always been more stringent and transparent than its @entity19 counterpart			0
by definition , mr @entity131 's claim for an evening meal was as cheap as chips			2

mps are allowed to claim for non-alcoholic drinks during overnight stays
