by @entity0 the @entity2 boss at the center of the ‘ distressed baby ’ row allegedly called another female employee who lost three of her unborn quadruplets an ‘ hr nightmare ’			1
@entity9 was accused of firing @entity10 because she was unable to travel due to her troubled pregnancy			1
the fact that she lost three of her babies before giving birth to the fourth made little difference to his decision , it was claimed			2
the lawsuit was filed in 2005 and was dismissed in 2008 after going through arbitration but sheds new light on @entity9 ’s recent comments			2
past problems : @entity9 was accused of forcing a sales executive out when she was suffering a terrible pregnancy with quadruplets when he worked for @entity28 spotlight : @entity9 's views of women at work were put under scrutiny after he accused two mothers of ' distressed babies ' of being to blame for cutting @entity2 401 ( k ) benefits			1
they had their daughter , pictured shortly after birth , in october 2012			0
she was four months premature he was criticized after revealing that @entity2 had cut benefits to employees after having to pay out $ 1 million to care for what he called two ‘ distressed babies ’			1
@entity9 reversed the decision after a firestorm and because @entity37 , one of the mothers of the two children , wrote a scathing article in which she accused him of using her story as ‘ an absurd justification for corporate cost - cutting ’			1
but this is not the first time he has been in trouble for his comments about female employees			0
miss @entity10 ’s lawsuit dates back to the time before mr @entity9 joined @entity2 , where he is currently chief executive			1
before that he was @entity28 ’s vice president for national sales and was working out of their @entity64 office , as was miss @entity10			1
in her lawsuit she says that by 2003 she had risen to @entity66 where she was ‘ highly successful and well regarded ’ and was managing the company ’s @entity68 sales force			2
in february the next year she became pregnant with quadruplets and told @entity9 that this meant she could no longer travel			1
miss @entity10 then lost two of her babies , a tragedy she informed mr @entity9 about			1
nevertheless , the lawsuit claims , miss @entity76 claims that one day when she came in , he showed her a chart which revealed her job had been eliminated			0
he allegedly tried to move to her to another role that would have been a ‘ significant demotion ’ - and the reason was because she could not travel by air			0
miss @entity10 offered to take lesser role that would let her travel by train and car and mr @entity9 is said to have accepted then allegedly ‘ almost immediately ’ changed his mind			2
at a meeting on june 4 2004 the lawsuit claims that mr @entity9 ‘ told her that she was an @entity90 nightmare and that he no longer wanted her in the @entity64 office ’			1
miss @entity10 claimed that she was fired the next day over the phone by mr @entity9 because he said it was the ‘ right thing to do ’			2
the lawsuit states that during this period miss @entity10 was ‘ in danger of losing another of her unborn children ’ - her husband had apparently contacted @entity28 to tell them she was going through a ‘ health crisis ’			2
on june 29 2004 she then lost her third child			0
the reason for the child ’s death is not explained in the lawsuit			0
after negotiations @entity105 returned to work the following month but mr @entity9 allegedly said he felt ‘ uncomfortable ’ around her and asked that she work from home			2
shocking : this gorgeous little girl was one of the ' distressed babies ' @entity2 chief @entity9 blamed for scaling back retirement savings plans shocked : @entity64 couple @entity37 ( left ) and @entity113 ( right ) are still in shock at the way @entity9 announced @entity2 's pension policy changes she was signed off work by her doctor due to her ‘ high - risk pregnancy ’ and claims that she was cheated out of money owed from sales commissions - her checks were ‘ substantially less ’ than they should have been , according to the lawsuit			1
miss @entity10 gave birth to her remaining child and towards the end of her maternity leave was looking forward to going back to work			0
but she was allegedly told she would have to take a ‘ low level operations position ’ which she found ‘ intolerable ’			0
in 2005 miss @entity10 was ' constructively dismissed ' and filed a discrimination lawsuit with the backing of the @entity132			0
miss @entity10 , 45 , is now president of @entity134 - based @entity133 , a marketing and advertising company			0
reached by phone @entity105 said : ‘ i ’m so sorry , i ca n’t comment			0
of course i have thoughts ( about @entity9 ) but i really ca n’t comment			0
‘ it ’s behind me now ’			0
@entity2 and @entity28 have not responded to @entity140 's request for comment			1
@entity28 and mr @entity9 were both named as defendants in the lawsuit			1
but at the time of the case @entity28 said the claims were ' without merit ' and vowed to fight the lawsuit ' vigorously '			0
ironically @entity2 's conference which aims to ' reset the agenda for women in the workplace ' begins today , with mr @entity9 due to be one of the speakers .			1

@entity2 *ceo* @entity9 blamed the costs of two women who *incurred* huge medical costs because of the care for their premature babies for the company cutting 401 ( k ) benefits
when he was at @entity28 , a sales executive sued him for pushing her out when she got pregnant with quadruplets
the court *documents* allege he called her a ' @entity90 nightmare ' when she lost three of the babies
