by @entity0 a young boy died from an asthma attack after a ' tragic ' blunder from a 999 call handler led to the ambulance arriving 23 minutes after the emergency call was made			1
eight - year - old @entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , started struggling for breath while enjoying a sleepover at his grandmother 's house in march last year , an inquest heard			1
but when his grandmother @entity16 phoned 999 , the operator thought the emergency was less serious than it was			1
@entity8 , pictured with his mother @entity18 , died from an asthma attack , after a blunder by a 999 operator meant the emergency call was categorised as less serious than it was it meant the next waiting ambulance was sent to another emergency instead - and @entity8 was not reached by paramedics until 23 minutes after the call			1
the young boy was eventually taken to hospital by ambulance staff , but was pronounced dead on arrival			2
tests showed he died of an acute asthmatic attack			1
the tragedy - described as a ' subconscious and isolated mistake ' - unfolded when the call handler asked a scripted question , but took the wrong answer , the inquest at @entity35 was told			1
the call operator - who had taken nearly 80 calls during the 12 - hour shift - asked @entity8 's grandmother : ' is he having any difficulty speaking through breaths ? '			1
but when the operator heard @entity8 mutter something in the background , she wrongly registered the answer as ' no ' instead of ' yes '			2
it meant @entity8 's situation was thought to be less urgent than it was - leading to a 13 - minute delay in the ambulance arriving			1
if the ambulance had been sent the first time , it could have arrived at @entity8 's grandmother 's within six minutes - at 7.27pm - from a station located just six miles away , the inquest was told			1
' full of life ' : @entity8 , who had suffered with the condition since he was five , was said to be ' mischievous ' and ' full of energy and life ' @entity8 , described by his mother as ' full of life and energy ' was not reached by paramedics until 23 minutes after the 999 call			1
he was taken to hospital but pronounced dead on arrival but , after the call was labelled as ' green ' rather than a life - threatening ' red ' , the ambulance was not sent as a priority			2
instead , an ambulance was not sent until 7.29pm , from a station 11 miles away			0
it meant the ambulance arrived for @entity8 at 7.40pm - 13 minutes after the first ambulance could have arrived			1
the inquest has been adjourned until june for an expert witness to be called to establish whether the time difference could have made a difference to @entity8 's life being saved			1
@entity8 , one of three brothers , had been diagnosed with asthma when he was five , the inquest was told			1
attacks could be triggered by being exposed to cat and dog fur and hot summer weather			0
@entity8 had often been admitted to hospital due to asthma attacks , including that same week			1
@entity8 was enjoying a sleepover at his grandmother 's house when he started ' wheezing ' , the inquest at @entity99 was told bur four days later , @entity8 was at a sleepover at his grandmother 's home in @entity103 , @entity9 , when he started wheezing heavily			1
his mother @entity104 , 31 , who described her son as ' mischievous and full of life and energy ' , told the inquest her son had played outside after school			0
but she 'd received a worried phone call from her mother just after 7.15pm			2
ms @entity16 said : ' she said @entity8 was wheezing			2
i thought he was okay but i could hear him in the background			2
i told her to give him his inhaler			0
' whilst on the phone i could hear @entity8 panicking			2
i could tell by the tone of his voice			0
i told her i would come back and that she should ring the ambulance			0
' his mother @entity122 , pictured here , rushed to his grandmother 's house by taxi			1
she said her son was running around trying to catch his breath and she 'd never seen him in such a state before while @entity8 's grandmother rang 999 , ms @entity16 phoned a taxi who took her to the house			1
when she arrived at the house , and there was no ambulance in sight , she assumed @entity8 had already been taken to hospital , she told the inquest			1
but then she saw @entity8 running out of the house , wheezing			1
she said : ' he was running around the garden , he was trying to get his breath back			2
i had never seen him in such a state before			0
' he collapsed as i was holding him			0
i was lifting him up off the ground , carrying him like a baby to get him to the taxi			0
his eyes just shut and he stopped breathing and he was limp			0
' the inquest heard the 999 operator had wrongly thought the young boy was not struggling to breathe			1
it meant the next available ambulance - which would have arrived at the home 13 minutes earlier - was sent elsewhere instead @entity8 's grandmother made a second 999 call to find out the whereabouts of the ambulance			1
meanwhile , the taxi driver attempted to give @entity8 cpr			2
an ambulance eventually arrived at 7.40pm and left the house at 7.56pm , the inquest heard			2
it arrived at @entity165 at 8.02pm , but the boy was pronounced dead on arrival			2
@entity168 , assistant service manager at the emergency centre of @entity170 , said inquiries showed the call handler had made an error while asking a series of scripted questions			1
the @entity165 in @entity10 , where @entity8 was taken by paramedics mrs @entity168 said : ' we went through the call			1
the caller heard him in the background			0
she asked ‘ is he having any difficulty speaking through breaths ? ’ ' the caller said she heard the child speak in the background and in her subconsciousness clicked ‘ no ’ when it was ‘ yes ’			0
we have talked about valuing the integrity of the caller			0
it is a human error			0
' due to the mistake , @entity8 's attack was coded as ' green ' instead of the more serious ' red '			1
mrs @entity168 explained life - threatening conditions were categorised as @entity195 and @entity196 , which means the ambulance service respond in eight minutes			2
@entity198 1 and 2 are to be responded to in 20 minutes and @entity199 within 60 minutes , she said			0
the inquest , heard at @entity99 , has been adjourned so an expert witness can be called			0
the coroner wants the expert to shed light on whether the delay in the ambulance arrival had a significant impact on @entity8 's death she said : ' the first call received by the emergency operator was at 7.17pm on march 14			1
it was given a green 1 response			0
the call for @entity8 was green and should have been code red			1
' due to the coding of @entity8 ’s case , the next available vehicle was sent to the home of a two - year - old toddler instead , the court was told			1
the ambulance which was eventually sent to the @entity8 house was dispatched from @entity223 , 11 miles away			1
that first ambulance was stationed just six miles away			0
mrs @entity168 said : ' that evening was extremely busy			0
there was a huge influx of emergency calls after 6.05pm			0
' at 7pm there were 58 incidents still waiting			0
we had to instigate calling back emergency calls			0
it shows the significant demand that evening			0
' the call taker has had a period of reflective action which has meant she has reflected on the on the call itself			2
' she listened to it to see what went wrong			0
we have also issued a bulletin to staff of @entity170 about the importance of recording information accurately given by the caller			0
' representing @entity170 , lawyer mr @entity247 : ' it is an isolated error by a person			0
it is human error , a tragic mistake			0
' coroner @entity253 said : ' @entity255 you have shown great dignity by your presence here today			0
' you will remember with great affection all the great traits @entity8 clearly had in his character			2
' i also commend mrs @entity168 for coming forward and giving the evidence as she has done so			0
