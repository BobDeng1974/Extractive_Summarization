by @entity0 a @entity3 - style rotunda , @entity5 glass lift and @entity8 's eye - catching skyscraper the @entity1 are on the shortlist for architecture 's top prize			1
the @entity12 - whose nominees also include @entity16 's @entity15 , the @entity17 , the @entity18 , and @entity19 - is awarded annually to the best new building			1
judges praised the revolutionary design of the @entity23			1
with its ' @entity3 rotunda ' and ' @entity5 - style glass lift ' , it was described as a landmark that has ' shaken the traditional perception of a library '			1
they said that making the tower , which is not yet fully occupied but houses a health clinic , offices , restaurants , hotel , apartments and public viewing gallery , on such a tight site was a ' rare achievement '			0
' understanding that there are many days when the @entity8 skyline reads only as a depressing grey silhouette , the architects have left a substantial part at the top open , adding further to the lightness even in these conditions , not unlike the @entity69 spire of a @entity48 cathedral			2
' meanwhile , they said the @entity19 felt more as though you were ' entering a metropolitan art gallery rather than a university department ' and would influence the design of art schools and other university buildings for years to come			2
the @entity1 , pictured left , was described by the judges as the most significant addition to the @entity8 skyline since @entity51 's and compared it to the spire of a gothic cathedral , while the stunning @entity19 , pictured right , was more like a ' metropolitan art gallery ' than a university department the @entity87 was highly praised - judges said removing the wings which had accommodated spectators during the @entity90 , allowed the building to ' fly free '			1
the ' conceptually flawless ' interior of the @entity87 was the backdrop for the swimming events at the @entity95 the @entity96 's @entity87 also recieved high praise , with judges praising architect @entity100 's building , which was inspired by the ' fluid geometry of water in motion ' , as very beautiful and ' conceptually flawless '			1
@entity16 's @entity15 was built on the site of the old theatre after it was deemed unsuited for productions and the audience in the 21st century			2
but the new build retains the ambience of an old building thanks to the use of recycled and exposed brick , judges said			2
' after nine years ' gestation , @entity16 has a brand new purpose - built theatre of outstanding quality			0
this is a building that will age gracefully , continually enriched by the patina of daily use			0
it will both reassure and delight its loyal audience and those discovering this gem for the first time			0
' @entity16 's @entity15 is a refurbished building that manages to retains its history and traditional feel with the use of recycled and exposed brick also shortlisted is the @entity130 - a ' startlingly original building ' , which is ' beautifully constructed ' and a ' massive contribution to its townscape '			1
@entity135 ( @entity135 ) president @entity134 said the shortlisted buildings were ' poetic '			0
' the shortlist comprises no ordinary new swimming pool , office block , theatre , library or university - they are beautiful , inspiring and transformative new buildings that their communities can relish and be proud of , ' he said			1
' they are remarkably crafted buildings and , the closer you look at their detail , both internally and externally , and their materiality , the more impressive they become			0
' the winner , picked by a team of judges , will be announced on october 16			0
the @entity156 's exterior , left , wedged into the surrounding townscape , while its interior , right , is an open space			0
