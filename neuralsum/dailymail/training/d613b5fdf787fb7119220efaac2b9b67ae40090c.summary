by @entity0 published : 13:39 est , 4 november 2012 updated : 14:26 est , 4 november 2012 @entity1 has suffered more than most as a country after decades of war and civil unrest			0
with the country now appearing on a more stable footing politically , the same can not be said of its once flourishing silk trade which it was so proud of			2
cheaper , foreign imports are threatening generations of silkmaking families , as well as there being a decreasing lack of support for silkworm farmers			2
dying trade ? an @entity16 handles cocoons at a silk factory in @entity20 competition from cheaper synthetic silk from @entity22 and @entity23 has put the industry at great risk proud : an @entity16 man shows raw silk ready to be woven into fabric - but the question is can it flourish in a day and age of cheaper imports ? tradition : skills which have been passed down through the generations of families in @entity20 are at serious risk of being lost in time ' in the past , our handicrafts were very valuable , and businesspeople and wealth customers used to go to those who were producing silk handkerchiefs , shawls and turbans , ' said @entity46 , speaking to @entity47 , 75 , his body bent after more than half a century as a silk weaver			1
' owning silk products was then a sign of nobility , but now the good customers are gone , along with our high wages			0
' cheaper , synthetic silk is being bought as an alternative , but as with any material which is cheaper to produce and buy , the quality is also lessened			0
career path : this young boy may have to re-evaluate whether it is a safe option to work in the silk industry sad : in @entity20 , once an important stop on the famous @entity65 , a few famlies are struggling to keep a once - splendid silk industry alive show of support : an @entity16 woman buys raw silk to be woven into fabric in a market place in @entity20 - supporting the local industry a pure , silk scarf might cost around 400 @entity75 ( £ 5 ) , whereas a synthetic version which could be imported from nearby @entity23 or @entity22 would only cost 150 @entity75 ( £ 2 )			1
the major products of @entity20 silk weaving industries include shawls , scarves , turbans and other silken fabrics			2
speaking to the @entity16 news , @entity83 , 75 , who learned the trade from his father when he was 10 said : ' thirty years ago there were 1,000 silk weaving looms in @entity20 , all of which were using pure silk , but now most of the weavers use synthetic silk			1
' i learned weaving from my father when i was 10 and for the past 65 years i have never used synthetic silk			0
' he has been weaving ever since and only with natural fibres			0
the price of natural threads has doubled , and a once thriving stop on the ' @entity65 ' now faces its biggest challenge yet , not only to keep family tradition going , but to also make a profitable business out of it			1
one kilogram of pure silk costs more than 3,000 @entity75 while synthetic @entity23 silk can be bought for 420 @entity75 per kilogram			0
however , if the @entity16 government stepped in and offered a fairer deal to support the silkworm farmers and weavers , the industry could compete with its synthetic opposite			1
' silk weaving is a halal craft and it reveals the native art of @entity116 ' , said @entity117 , head of silkworm producers and silk weavers , to the @entity16			2
' the government should not let this art vanish , ' @entity117 said			0
a long stretch : a map showing the traditional ' @entity65 ' or ' @entity65 ; ' however with the growth of free trade , a country 's individual industry is threatened worrying : the @entity20 region of northern @entity1 has historically been the centre of silk production , textiles , and a burgeoning garment industry			1

@entity20 , to the west of @entity134 , was once an important stop on the @entity65 - but now their once - proud industry faces a serious threat
@entity141 , imported , synthetic fibre could see @entity16 silkmakers as well as silkworm farmers out of business
a synthetic scarf will cost half as much as a *genuine* silk product
workers call on the government to step in and secure the *future* of the historic and family - *orientated* trade
