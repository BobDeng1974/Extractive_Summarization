@entity1 boss @entity0 insists it will not be a major disaster if his side are forced to play two extra games to reclaim their @entity7 return			1
the @entity8 currently lead the way in the race for second spot in the @entity12 , with a one - point advantage over @entity14 and a six - point cushion separating them from @entity17			1
finishing immediately behind newly - crowned champions @entity18 would spare the @entity20 men the bother of two extra hazardous games in the play - offs , with the teams finishing third and fourth facing off over two legs before taking on the second tier 's runners - up			1
the winner of that tie then meets the @entity7 's second - bottom side in a crucial winner - takes - all battle			2
@entity0 is relaxed about the prospect of @entity1 finishing third in the @entity12 but having stumbled to a 3 - 0 defeat against @entity17 and a 1 - 1 draw with basement side @entity37 either side of sunday 's four - goal romp over @entity40 , there is no guarantee the @entity42 will see off saturday 's trip to @entity44 without another slip - up			1
@entity0 , though , is ready to take whatever outcome is thrown his way			2
he said : ' at this moment second place is in our own hands			0
if you 'd given me that a few weeks ago when i first came in , i 'd have snapped your hands off for it			0
' there were one or two people who thought we would n't even reach the play - offs			1
@entity0 faces the media on friday ahead of saturday 's trip to @entity44 as @entity1 look to hold on to second ' we 've done that first part			2
obviously we want to get second but @entity14 and @entity17 want the same			0
' you do n't want to have to play the extra games but if you have to , you will			1
if you have to get through to the top league by playing six games then so be it			2
' of course it 's important to us to finish second			0
but if we finish third or fourth that does not mean we wo n't get promotion			0
it 's not the end of the world			0
' @entity0 was also happy to see a peaceful resolution reached after the row raised by the @entity77 's messy meddling with the @entity12 fixture list			1
@entity1 ' final - day tie with @entity18 at @entity80 was pushed back 24 hours to sunday , may 3 , to accommodate @entity81			0
@entity0 joins in training on friday as the @entity1 boss prepares his side for saturday 's clash but that left @entity14 raging as having played their last game at @entity90 on the saturday , they claimed @entity0 's team would be advantaged by the fact they would know the result required in @entity94 to claim second			2
compromise was reached when @entity81 gave the league permission to switch the @entity18 - @entity1 tie back to its original may 2 slot			0
' everyone playing at the same time is fine and the right thing to do , ' said @entity0			1
but there could yet be more tinkering with the schedule to come			0
@entity14 and @entity90 - who have yet to be counted out of the play - off chase - will battle for a place in the @entity107 final on saturday , leaving the possibility that the second leg of the play - off final may have to be pushed back into june			1
@entity1 dropped two points at @entity12 bottom side @entity37 in their bid for promotion the @entity77 is expected to announce early next week if a change of date is required but @entity1 are bracing themselves for an administrative nightmare , with 12 first - team members due to become free agents on june 1			1
@entity0 confirmed the club 's five loanees from @entity123 are registered until june 9 , and will be free to play whatever happens			1
but he admitted the club may have to hand short - term deals to their players to see them through to the re-arranged date			0
' we wo n't think about it until it becomes a problem , ' he said			0
' but it will certainly need to be something that is looked at if that does become the case , as we have almost a dozen players whose contract will be up at the end of may			0

rangers are currently second in the @entity12 with three games to go
finishing third would mean playing two extra play - off matches vs fourth
but *manager* @entity0 is relaxed about the prospect of finishing third
