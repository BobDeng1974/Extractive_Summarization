created : 18:06 est , 11 july 2014 university lecturer @entity0 is staggering under the weight of her over-flowing shopping basket			0
peeking out are packets of fresh gnocchi and tagliatelle , @entity7 mussels , crayfish tails , wafer - thin @entity10 ham , slabs of holey @entity14 cheese and a bottle of @entity16			0
with a sleek blowdry and cut - glass vowels , the 40 - year - old is middle class from the top of her head to the tips of her pedicured toes			1
( indeed she ’s carrying a @entity41 bag for life )			2
yet she is queuing for the till at discount supermarket @entity28 in @entity46 , south @entity47			2
there is a slight hiccup when she is told the store does n’t accept credit cards , but she seems unruffled , selects another card from her purse , and positively skips out of the door			0
what is happening here ? there was a time when the middle classes would rather starve than be seen in a discount supermarket			0
to show one ’s face at @entity62 , the @entity64 cut - price superstore with the garish yellow - and - black logo that launched 200 stores in @entity67 in the @entity68 , was social suicide			0
figures this week revealed that the combined sales of @entity28 and @entity29 are likely to overtake those of @entity74 — a rise driven by middle - class shoppers deserting the likes of @entity78 ’s , @entity79 and even @entity41 , for the discount chains			1
@entity28 now has more than 600 shops in the @entity67 , and @entity29 more than 500			1
@entity29 expects to generate record sales of £ 7 billion this year , while @entity28 @entity67 expects to enjoy a similar turnover			1
and the secret to their seduction of the mid-market shopper ? they have undercut @entity67 supermarkets on the luxury goods middle - class shoppers ca n’t bring themselves to go without			1
when @entity67 shoppers fell in love with @entity95 food , from the seventies onwards , all the supermarkets fell over themselves to stock it			2
they saw an opportunity to sell @entity35 cheese and such like as ‘ deli ’ foods , and made shoppers pay through the nose for them			0
@entity29 and @entity28 have cottoned on to middle class values , promoting affordable win and dinner - part show - stoppers at bargain prices meanwhile , in @entity107 , @entity29 and @entity28 were sourcing foods that are seen as everyday items in the countries where they originated , for example ham from @entity10 and the @entity113 , gouda from @entity115 , @entity116 from @entity117 , and ice cream from @entity119			1
as staples , they were priced reasonably , and the shops flourished , expanding across @entity123 to @entity67			2
the realisation over the past few years that @entity29 and @entity28 sell similar foods to @entity41 and @entity78 ’s , but at the price enjoyed by shoppers in @entity117 , @entity115 , @entity128 , @entity119 and @entity129 , has sent @entity67 shoppers flocking to their stores			1
but the rise of cut - price shops has n’t happened overnight			0
ever since 2008 ’s financial crash , the chat at dinner parties has been less about where everyone will be going skiing and more about that great bottle of extra virgin olive oil from @entity29			0
‘ so cheap , you ’d never know , ’ boasted one friend , soon after her conversion to bargain - basement shopping			0
low - cost supermarkets are also thriving because we have lost faith in leviathans such as @entity79			0
shoppers are tired of expensive advertising campaigns and @entity151 labels that only mean we end up with more than we can chew — and wasting a shameful amount of food			0
the opening of @entity29 and @entity28 stores now attract queues of people waiting to get inside first the sight of a superstore stuffed with thousands of lines feels decadent , while @entity28 and @entity29 , with their smallish buildings and modest ranges — @entity29 and @entity28 stock between 1,000 and 3,000 lines , compared with more than 50,000 at a superstore — seem positively intimate			1
for cash and time - strapped middle - class shoppers , this simplicity is appealing			1
shrewdly , @entity29 and @entity28 have since cottoned on to other @entity67 middle - class values , producing dinner - party show - stoppers at bargain prices			1
the fashionable steak of the moment is @entity175 , a @entity177 method of producing tender , fat - marbled beef involving feeding the cattle with beer and massaging its rump			0
the meat is famously decadent , but @entity29 sell @entity175 beef @entity183 for just £ 6.69			2
locally sourced produce has become fashionable with the middle classes in recent years , and again @entity29 and @entity28 were quick to catch on			1
for christmas 2012 , @entity29 launched the @entity188 free - range bronze turkey , reared near the ancient @entity189 , which straddles @entity190 and @entity191 , in portable sheds with access to grassy fields			0
at £ 37.99 per turkey , @entity29 undercut the competition by £ 10 and produced something of equal standard to @entity41 and @entity78 ’s			1
the rest of the year , @entity28 sell whole free - range chickens for £ 5 each			1
both chains are also brilliant at capitalising on short - lived trends			0
in this sport - obsessed summer , with the @entity203 in @entity67 , @entity204 and the @entity205 all on our screens , @entity28 launched a limited range of high - end bikes and cycling equipment at discount prices			1
@entity29 launched a £ 65 gps watch in june that measures your heartbeat and tells you where you are — as well as what time it is			2
no wonder @entity79 is having a crisis of confidence			0
@entity29 and @entity28 are tapping into the interests and tastes of shoppers almost effortlessly , while the giant retailer throws them 10,000 lines and get barely a bite			1
and the best thing about @entity29 and @entity28 ? they are taking the snobbery out of grocery shopping , selling delicious foods at the price paid in @entity123 supermarkets and not marking them up as luxuries for the rich			2
cheers — or @entity235 ! as our @entity107 friends would say — to that !			0

shoppers deserting @entity78 *'s* , @entity41 and @entity79 for @entity29 and @entity28
@entity28 now has more than 600 shops in the @entity67 , and @entity29 more than 500
both expect to enjoy a turnover of around £ *7billion* this year
@entity248 to *success* has been winning over middle class shoppers
