by @entity0 for @entity1 my search for the @entity5 experience brings me to @entity6 , the women - only members club that caters to @entity11 's health conscious elite			1
rumoured members include the ultra-fashionable @entity14 sisters ; it 's said that supermodel sister @entity16 prepped for one of her high profile runway shows through these very hallowed halls			2
turning up through the front doors i feel as if i 've stepped into a billionaire 's private home instead of being in a high - end medi spa			1
@entity25 interior : the women - only members club looks like a billionaire 's private home instead of a high - end medi spa ' prevention is the medicine of the millennium ' , says dr @entity34 , one of the country 's most prominent physicians			1
it 's immediately apparent to me , that when you are a member of the a-list , looking after your health means more than attending a @entity42 or a @entity44 class once a week			0
it 's a full - body , bespoke , luxury experience			1
i signed on for their three - day cleanse which is a combination of traditional @entity50 , acupuncture , fitness , spa treatments , and nutritional advice and menus			1
an mot of sorts , the cleanse offers those seeking to overhaul their lifestyles a nudge in the right direction			1
my first initiation is with @entity50 practitioner @entity65 who will help design my personal cleanse			1
his manner is warm and inviting and we speak about the birth of my baby , where my health can improve and how i can achieve my goals			0
model clientele : @entity14 and her sister @entity74 are rumoured to be members of @entity6 the fully equipped gym offers @entity78 sessions , dynamic yoga , spin endurance workou @entity0 spent some of the ' loveliest days of her life ' at @entity6 notes based on my consultation will be put on file and all the other therapists will refer to them for the next three days , ensuring that everyone tailors their approach based on my specific needs			1
being a-list is all about personalised services ; nothing is ever general			0
the cleanse kicks off with a blood test consultation with one of the country 's most prominent physicians , dr. @entity34			1
his private patient list is so exclusive i had to sign an @entity102 not to name names			0
he gives me an analysis of my blood test , going through virtually every single facet of my health			0
he assures me that ' prevention is the medicine of the millennium ' and encourages me to think proactively about my health , adding that ' good health begins with accepting responsibility for one 's own health and wellbeing			1
' @entity117 words , but between this and the atmosphere – i spotted a willowy supermodel in the changing room – i have only been here a few hours and am already kind of sold on this place			0
my day continues in the gym , set up by @entity124 who trains @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			2
i have a @entity78 session with handsome trainer @entity129 , who quickly picks up on the fact that my abdominal wall still has n't closed since i gave birth			0
he recommends exercises i can do help the process			0
the spa is ' beyond gorgeous ' and has the only flotation tank in the @entity138 this is swiftly followed by ' diet ' lunch in the very glamorous restaurant which is comparable to any five - star restaurant			1
honestly , if i could eat like this at every meal i would be super skinny by now			0
it 's all been set up to be easily digestible ; dishes are gluten - , sugar - , dairy - and caffeine - free			2
as you can probably surmise , the spa is beyond gorgeous			2
i have ' @entity150 ; which uses lymphatic suction and @entity153 acupressure to tighten skin and fight wrinkles			1
i emerge looking less jowly and a little brighter			0
next is a @entity50 body balancing treatment , followed by a gentle but thorough colonic , and then , probably the best massage of my life , performed by @entity162 , a trained osteopath from @entity163			1
then it 's on to @entity165 – water , steam , sea salt and essential oils all combined in a mixture of hot and cold temperatures			0
i start with a blistering sauna after which i stand under at 15 - foot @entity174 on the ' cool fog ' setting			2
note to @entity176 – it really should be called @entity178			0
then it 's into the steam room followed by the far more soothing ' @entity182 ' setting			0
the three - day cleanse is an mot of sorts and offers those seeking to overhaul their lifestyles a nudge in the right direction @entity191 has launched a taster of the new cleanse for those keen to sample the lifestyle the treatment continues with a sea salt scrub , and a spirulina body wrap			1
and ends with a shower therapy where jets of water sway up and down from the ceiling on top of me , offering a delightful kind of water massage			0
i ca n't leave without stealing a few moments in the flotation tank			1
it 's the only one in the @entity138 , and i make sure to spend several moments gently buoyant on a soft , warm cushion atop waves			1
after three days i literally feel as if i am floating out of the building when i leave for the evening			0
at £ 1,900 the treatment does n't come cheap			2
but it was , without exaggeration , some of loveliest days of my life and i can not recommend it highly enough			0
@entity191 has launched a taster of the new cleanse for those keen to sample the lifestyle			2
@entity223 , their new home food delivery service , has six menus which have been artfully devised by their expert team of nutritionists and chefs and is available on their website			0
at £ 42.50 per day i 'm seriously tempted to give it a go – maybe i can find a @entity44 class somewhere too			2
glamorous lunch : meals are set - up to be easily digestible and all dishes are gluten - , sugar - , dairy - and caffeine - free			2
