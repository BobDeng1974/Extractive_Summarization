by @entity0 , @entity1 in the hierarchy of cycling 's @entity4 , the @entity2 ranks third out of three			0
but this season , it could prove to be the best of the lot			0
@entity12 's dominance amid a dearth of real contenders made the @entity15 seem all too easy , while injuries decimated the @entity18 field and left the door wide open for @entity20			1
and so fans are looking to the @entity2 - where six former @entity4 winners will line up for saturday 's opening team time trial in @entity25 - for a real battle to be fought			1
comeback : @entity28 's @entity27 will ride the @entity2 after pulling out of the @entity18 return : @entity30 's @entity29 also pulled out of the tour through injury but will ride at the @entity2 favourite : @entity12 , who won the @entity33 , will line - up alongside @entity27 and @entity29 @entity28 's @entity27 and @entity30 's @entity29 - the latter a two - time winner of his home @entity4 - return after injuries ended their bids for @entity4 glory , but whether either yet has the form or fitness to challenge for victory remains to be seen			1
what is clear is that neither man is talking like a potential winner			0
' perhaps in the last week , i can fight for a stage win , ' @entity29 said of his prospects , while @entity27 simply spoke in general terms of getting back on track after the disappointment of the @entity4			1
' i have always really enjoyed racing at the @entity2 , it 's a tough race but a great opportunity for the whole team , ' he said			0
' i know that the level of competition will be incredibly high this year , but we have got a strong line up so we hope to be as competitive as possible			0
' that leaves @entity60 's @entity12 as the clear favourite after he skipped the @entity4 entirely , with the young @entity62 apparently in much better shape than his older team - mate and co-captain , former @entity2 winner @entity64			1
@entity67 , meanwhile , will have a three - pronged attack with @entity70 @entity69 and @entity72 @entity71 returning from injury and former @entity15 winner @entity74 bringing plenty of experience to the table			1
fall : @entity27 was injured during the @entity18 as he feel three times in two days and had to withdraw @entity80 's @entity79 , 35 , is missing a @entity4 victory off an otherwise impressive palmares , and where better to win one than on home soil			0
@entity84 , who are without sprinter @entity86 , will instead put everything into @entity15 runner - up @entity90 's bid for glory , while @entity94 's @entity93 team will be backing 24 - year - old @entity96 @entity95 , who was third in @entity96			1
defending champion @entity97 ( @entity98 ) has been withdrawn from the race by his team after treatment for bronchitis took his levels of cortisol below the minimum level expected by the @entity106			0
the 42 - year - old had been given a therapeutic use exemption for the treatment by the @entity110 but @entity98 have replaced the @entity72 with @entity111			0
besides @entity27 , @entity113 interest will come in the form of his @entity28 team - mates @entity116 and @entity117 , as well as @entity119 's 21 - year - old @entity118 , who gets his @entity4 chance a little under two months after twin brother @entity121 started the @entity18 in @entity122			1
rivals : @entity27 ( second left ) and @entity29 ( second right ) surprisingly do not start the race as favourites although the battle gets under way with what promises to be a tough , technical team time trial full of roundabouts on saturday , the real fight will take place in the mountains with no fewer than eight summit finishes - the first coming on stage six - and plenty of tough descents in between			1
the real business comes at the end of the second week , with three consecutive summit finishes testing the legs of the contenders			0
it is little wonder then that @entity12 , who showed he could challenge @entity27 on the biggest climbs of the @entity148 , that finds himself as the favourite			2
the 24 - year - old @entity62 showed his form with victory in the @entity2 a @entity152 last week and will take the start on a high			2
' it 's a real important win for me , not just for the sake of victory , but also because it gives me massive confidence before the @entity2 , ' @entity12 said after that race			2
' i 'm sure there are rivals quite stronger than me at the moment , but this shows i 'll be getting to the race in good condition , and provided that @entity64 ( @entity167 ) and the rest will be strong again , this can only be good			0
' podium : @entity12 ( left ) and @entity27 ( centre ) will go head - to - head once against at the 2014 @entity2 a @entity2			2

@entity28 's @entity27 and @entity30 's @entity29 will line up on saturday
both @entity175 winners pulled out of @entity176 with injuries
@entity62 @entity15 winner @entity12 starts race as favourite
