by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 19:35 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 02:51 est , 19 february 2013 hospital managers behind one of the worst health scandals in living memory won glowing praise from the head of the @entity9			2
at the height of the @entity13 scandal , sir @entity10 toured wards and in a follow - up letter said ‘ well done ’ for ‘ progress in target areas ’			1
the visit came in october 2005 – a year in which 300 patients are thought to have died because of poor care			1
by 2009 , the total stood at 1,200			0
at the height of the @entity13 scandal , sir @entity10 toured wards and in a follow - up letter said ' well done ' for ' progress in target areas ' bereaved families , who are calling for sir @entity10 to quit , say many lives could have been spared had he investigated the health trust			1
in other developments in the @entity9 crisis : the letter obtained by the @entity33 shows the @entity9 chief visited @entity13 ’s two hospitals – @entity37 and @entity36 – while he was in charge of the regional health board			1
it is thought the visit was on october 27 and was followed by a letter of congratulation to the chief executive			2
it noted improvements on hitting targets for waiting times in casualty , cancer treatment , surgery and outpatients			0
yet that month an elderly woman who had suffered a stroke was sent home by a casualty doctor who misdiagnosed her as having a urine infection			0
the visit came in october 2005 ¿ a year in which 300 patients are thought to have died because of poor care			1
by 2009 , the total stood at 1,200 she fell into a coma two days later and died			0
@entity64 , who set up the campaign group cure the @entity9 after her mother died at the trust , said : ‘ he should have been asking questions of the trust ’s chief executive , not congratulating him			2
‘ the care was just disastrous from 2004 and it became a longstanding problem			0
how can he carry on in his job after all this ? ’ last week sir @entity10 was implicated in another scandal when it emerged he had ignored warnings about a hospital trust where 670 patients may have died needlessly			1
@entity82 and @entity83 , the former chief executive and chairman of @entity86 , say they wrote to the chief executive in 2009 but were ignored			0
mr @entity82 was later sacked and given a £ 500,000 pay - off with a gagging clause to keep silent			2
the trust is being investigated by the @entity9 for having one of the highest death rates in the country			2
yesterday , the prime minister added to the pressure by saying the @entity9 needed to act on problems ‘ much more swiftly ’			1
mr @entity98 said there had been ‘ no accountability ’ for the failings at @entity13 with those responsible being allowed to quietly retire or move on			1
speaking from @entity102 , he added : ‘ there was n’t proper accountability			0
there were n’t proper consequences and that is not acceptable			0
’ last week health secretary @entity108 wrote to all health trusts urging them not to use gagging orders to deter whistleblowing			2
asked about this , the prime minister said : ‘ i agree with what @entity108 has said over the last couple of days			0
you should n’t need to rely on whistleblowing in the @entity9 , we should be discovering problems much more swiftly			2
we should be discovering them as they occur			0
’ @entity82 ( left ) and @entity83 ( right ) , the former chief executive and chairman of @entity86 , say they wrote to the chief executive in 2009 but were ignored mr @entity98 said the government was trying to get hospital trusts to provide better care by asking patients whether they would recommend them to their friends and family			1
but he made clear where this fails , there is a case for whistleblowing : ‘ that ’s what the transparency agenda is about			0
that ’s what the friends and family test is about , that ’s what boosting the @entity144 is all about			0
that ’s what the chief inspector of hospitals is all about			0
sir @entity10 has been facing increasing calls to resign since a report into the @entity13 scandal was published earlier this month			1
sir @entity10 also appointed the trust ’s failed chief executive @entity153 – even though he had no formal managerial training and went on to sack 50 nurses			1
later , as chief executive of the @entity158 , he is said to have dismissed warnings from relatives			0
he apparently told a watchdog investigating the hospital trust not to pay too much attention to the concerns of the families as they were ‘ simply lobbying ’			1
up to 1,200 patients are thought to have died unnecessarily at @entity13 and many hundreds of others suffered ‘ inhumane ’ and ‘ inexcusable ’ care			1
sir @entity10 , who earns £ 211,000 a year , has resisted calls to resign , saying the failures have been ‘ system wide ’			1
but last week two @entity173 mps from the health select committee , @entity175 and @entity176 , urged him to consider his position			0
an online petition on a @entity125 website calling on him to go has received 3,796 signatures			2
a spokesman for sir @entity10 said : ‘ sir @entity10 took on responsibility for the @entity183 and @entity184 for just ten months , along with being chief executive of two other health authorities			1
‘ there was no information that he saw during that time that alerted him to the problems at @entity191			0
