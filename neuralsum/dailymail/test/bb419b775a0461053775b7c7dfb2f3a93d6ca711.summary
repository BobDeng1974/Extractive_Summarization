@entity0 has accused the @entity2 candidate running against him in the @entity4 constituency of lying about being forced to marry when she was 15 years old			1
@entity6 , a mother - of - three from @entity7 , has previously claimed that she was coerced into marrying her cousin in @entity9 before being sexually and physically abused			2
however , mr @entity0 's @entity10 now claims to have obtained a copy of her ' nikah ' , or marriage certificate , showing that she actually married when she was 16 and a half in 1990			1
@entity6 , the @entity15 candidate standing against @entity0 in @entity4 , has previously told how she was forced into marriage age 15 - but mr @entity0 's party claims to have evidence this is untrue at a hustings on wednesday night ( pictured ) mr @entity0 produced a nikah , or @entity9 marriage certificate , which he claims shows that ms @entity6 was in fact married in 1990 , when she was 16 and a half at a hustings in @entity7 on wednesday night , mr @entity0 , who is defending a 10,000 - vote majority , produced the document , saying ms @entity6 has ' only a passing acquaintance with the truth			1
' to applause , he also accused her of playing into negative stereotypes about @entity9 , and accused her of slandering the @entity33 @entity9 community			2
but ms @entity6 has now hit back , saying there are two copies of her @entity36			1
one dated 1990 , which mr @entity0 has , and another earlier version dated 1988 , which has been supplied to @entity39			2
a spokesman for the @entity2 said that ms @entity6 was forced into marriage aged 15 , but that her husband wanted to come to the @entity33 on a spouse visa			1
because the @entity33 authorities do not recognise marriages to people under the age of 16 , a second document was drawn up and dated 1990			0
they say this is the document mr @entity0 's party has			1
a @entity2 spokesman said : ' @entity0 is an absentee mp who has failed to stand up for , and has nothing positive to offer to , the people of @entity4			2
' he is instead resorting to desperate untruths about @entity2 â€™s candidate			0
we have written to him to warn him that we believe his conduct to be a breach of election law			0
' while @entity0 spends his time seeking to divide our community , @entity6 and @entity2 will continue to show people that she will be a strong voice for @entity4			2
' @entity2 also accused mr @entity0 of obtaining the nikah by sending a man to the registry office in @entity68 posing as ms @entity6 's father , who died several years ago			1
a @entity10 spokesman responded , saying the allegations were ' totally and utterly untrue ' , insisting that their contact had simply requested the certificate and paid a five rupee sum before it was handed over			0
speaking to @entity39 , he said : ' we were given a copy of the nikah by a close family member in this country so we decided to check whether this was genuine			0
however , @entity2 have said there are two copies of the nikah , the original being dated in 1988 , when ms @entity6 would have been 15 , which they are in possession of			1
they say the second was drawn up when ms @entity6 's husband tried to get a spouse visa to the @entity33 , where marriages to those under 16 are not recognised the @entity2 said they have been in touch with the election watchdog about mr @entity0 's comments , claiming they breach guidelines and warning him not to repeat them ' we got a third party to go to the registry office in @entity68 , where he retrieved the original nikah showing the marriage was in 1990			1
' there was no subterfuge , he paid five rupees and he was given the certificate			0
' speaking to the @entity104 , the party said the nikah dated 1990 revealed that ms @entity6 's mother and family members attended , claiming that this shows the ceremony was not forced			1
on the subject of a second nikah dated 1988 , he said the party was waiting for it to be produced so it could be independently verified			0
the spokesman also claimed that it was not possible for two copies of the nikah to exist without the couple first being divorced , and said @entity2 had yet to produce proof of a separation			2
the @entity2 told @entity39 that they had already given the document , which is written in urdu , to three independent translators who had all confirmed it was genuine			0
@entity2 also said the party had complained to the election watchdog about mr @entity0 's behaviour , saying he had made false statements about ms @entity6 , and warned for him not to repeat them			1
ms @entity6 first went public with the story of her childhood early last month , just days after being selected as @entity2 's candidate in @entity4			1
in an open letter , she described growing up in @entity7 in extreme poverty and becoming homeless aged six after her father left his family destitute when he eloped with a 16 - year - old neighbour			0
she said was forced to be a parent to her two sisters after her mother , who had suffered years of abuse at the hands of a local drug dealer , was jailed for his murder after she poisoned him			0
she said she became a political campaigner while fighting for her mother 's release from prison , which came in 2000 after 14 years behind bars			0
after ms @entity6 's mother was jailed she became estranged from the rest of the family , but travelled to @entity9 in the late 80s to see them			2
it was then that she claims she was forced into marrying her cousin , saying she only agreed after being coerced by other family members			0
according to her account , she escaped that relationship in 1992 before going back to college in @entity33 .			0

@entity6 claimed to have been forced into abusive marriage aged 15
but mr @entity0 says he has marriage certificate showing she was 16
accused her of playing into stereotypes and *demonizing* @entity9
@entity2 hit back , saying there are two marriage certificates , and they have the original from 1988 showing ms @entity6 was in fact 15
party say they wrote to election watchdog over mr @entity0 's allegation
