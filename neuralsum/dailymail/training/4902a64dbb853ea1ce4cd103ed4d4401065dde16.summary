the @entity1 mansion of disgraced former @entity3 boss @entity2 has vanished from @entity4 just weeks after the search giant acknowledged users ' ' right to be forgotten '			1
the former banker 's £ 3million home , in an exclusive suburb of @entity11 , can no longer be viewed online - unlike the rest of his street			1
usually , users of the service can use @entity4 to be shown street - level photographs of almost everywhere in the @entity18			2
vanished : former @entity3 chief 's @entity11 home , pictured , can no longer be viewed on @entity4 's street view hidden : most of the area of @entity11 where mr @entity2 lives , marked in blue , is visible on the service			1
but a small area , circled , which contains his house can no longer be seen but a small section of its map service - which covers the former banker 's home and was once freely accessible - has since disappeared			1
the search engine automatically blurs and obscures details such as faces and car numberplates to avoid breaching residents ' privacy			0
mr @entity2 , whose management of the @entity3 contributed to the disastrous financial crash of 2008 , has been held up as a figurehead of capitalist excess			1
his house - one of two in the @entity1 capital - has previously been targeted by vandals , who smashed windows at the home in 2009 as a protest against his riches from banking			2
catastrophic : mr @entity2 , pictured , resigned from @entity3 in disgrace in 2009			1
a month later the bank announced a £ 24billion loss			0
the former chief executive was stripped of his knighthood in 2012 close : users can approach mr @entity2 's house , but images further than the one shown have been erased @entity4 could not confirm whether mr @entity2 had requested the removal , though insiders suggested it was in fact a bug in the system which stripped out the pictures			1
but a spokesman for the search engine confirmed that it has always been possible for users with a ' compelling case ' to convince them to remove images of their homes			0
the company has been hit by a huge increase in requests to remove data from its search archives after a @entity82 court ruled that in favour of citizens ' ' right to be forgotten '			0
the legal decision means that companies holding vast quantities of data - such as search engines - can be forced to take down information which is deemed ' inadequate , irrelevant or excessive '			0
it is designed to allow people to suppress embarrassing information about their pasts if it is no longer relevant			0
services such as @entity4 would not be covered by the ruling - but there are fears that it could make it easier for people such as disreputable businessmen and minor criminals to cover up their past			0
@entity2 became one of @entity1 ’s best - known figures after his career in banking took off in 2000 and he presided over the @entity3 ’s rapid rise to global prominence with assets of £ 1.9trillion however , the ruling does include an exception for those who have prominent roles in public life			2
mr @entity2 , nicknamed ' @entity2 ' in the @entity117 because of his ruthless approach to business , shot to prominence in 2000 and built @entity3 into a world financial player with a series of takeovers and mergers			1
he was knighted in 2004 for ' services to banking ' , shortly after being named @entity126 by @entity127			0
but the bank - once valued at almost £ trillion - began racking up huge losses , and eventually needed an enormous taxpayer - funded bailout			0
the government continues to own 64 per cent of the bank 's shares			0
mr @entity2 's house was targeted by anti-capitalist protesters in 2009 , three months after he resigned as @entity3 's chief executive			1
he quit just one month before @entity3 unveiled a £ 24billion loss on its 2008 trading - the largest annual loss ever reported by a @entity18 company			2
over the following years a chorus of outrage directed at mr @entity2 continued to swell , culminating in his being stripped of his knighthood in 2012			1
mr @entity2 could not be reached for comment .			2

shamed *ex-banker* 's @entity11 home vanished from search service
only a small section was removed , and the rest of the street remains visible
mr @entity2 presided over catastrophic @entity3 results ahead of financial crisis
was targeted by vandals in 2009 , and stripped of knighthood in 2012
