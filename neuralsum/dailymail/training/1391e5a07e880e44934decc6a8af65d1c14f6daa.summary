officers have asked anyone who recognises the people in this @entity51 image to contact them immediately the first attack occurred outside @entity53 , ( pictured ) which is located on @entity54 , where two men were sprayed in the face with the substance following a row with another group nearby ' it went right in my eyes and it sprayed into my friend 's mouth			1
my face was burning so much , i thought it was acid			1
i thought i would never see again and my face was melting			1
' he poured every last drop onto us and then turned around and walked away , like it was mission accomplished			2
' the chemical burnt the cornea in my left eye and the vision has n't cleared since			2
the doctors said it should hopefully return but there is no guarantee			2
' my friend 's tongue was swollen and it looked like someone had scratched part of it away			2
