it is like running into a brick wall , right now , playing this @entity3 team			1
a beautifully constructed brick wall , obviously			0
not one slung up by a couple of navvies looking to take an early cut over @entity9			0
this is a wall of great precision and craftsmanship , of sound foundations and excellent structure			0
@entity15 came here in good form , with half an eye on an upset , and bounced straight off @entity3			1
they hit a post through @entity22 in the 87th minute , but barely threatened before that			0
leaders @entity3 recorded their third straight 2 - 0 @entity26 victory on @entity27 against @entity29 rivals @entity15 @entity3 were in complete control from start to finish as they eased past @entity15 at @entity33 @entity34 feels right at home at @entity33			1
the @entity36 has scored nine goals and had one assist in his eight home league games this season			1
not starting two of your best players does not help — but it is hard to imagine even @entity45 and @entity46 would have made an enormous difference , so tight is this @entity3 unit			1
@entity15 manager @entity49 elected to introduce them in the 59th minute and in the 62nd @entity3 scored their second			1
they could have had many , many more			0
@entity3 had 28 shots , of which nine were on target and @entity54 , @entity15 ’s goalkeeper , was arguably the man of the match			1
@entity57 is getting huge performances out of his players and even the goals were events , of a sort			1
@entity63 scored in consecutive games for the first time since august 2006 — against @entity66 for @entity67 and @entity68 for @entity3 — while @entity34 marked a return to form with an absolute peach to confirm victory in the second half			1
@entity63 gave his side the lead in the first half at @entity33 when he converted from close range on the half hour mark the @entity3 captain prodded home from two yards out after a corner was flicked on into his direction at the near post @entity63 turns away to celebrate his second goal in as many games after setting @entity3 on their way to a win at @entity87 on monday @entity63 celebrates his goal in the 31st minute at @entity33 with @entity89 duo @entity34 and @entity90 @entity3 : @entity91 6.5 , @entity92 7 , @entity93 7 , @entity63 7.5 , @entity94 7 , @entity90 7 , @entity95 7.5 , @entity96 6.5 ( @entity97 86 ) , @entity98 6.5 ( @entity99 83 ) , @entity100 6.5 , @entity34 7 ( @entity101 83 )			1

ratings by @entity129 at @entity33 @entity90 , whose heat map is displayed above , produced another dominant performance in central midfield for @entity133 @entity34 ’s form has dipped of late and he had scored one goal in his last six appearances going into this match			1
as strikers feed off confidence , the sight of him taking three @entity15 defenders out of the game in one swift goalscoring movement will not make comfortable viewing at @entity145 , where @entity3 are due next			1
yet this was not just about the matchwinners			0
the usual suspects in the supporting cast — @entity95 , @entity90 , @entity100 — maintained their extremely high standards , while @entity96 was tireless , perhaps the hardest worker on the field			2
last to play at the weekend , first out this @entity27 , @entity3 showed no signs of festive fatigue			1
@entity57 said he does not have a grand plan for this holiday season , and takes each game on merit			2
maybe this optimism will catch up with his players come january 1 at @entity159 , but this was another display that had the mark of champions			0
@entity49 needs to beat @entity164 on sunday for his own strategy to be deemed successful			0
leaving out @entity45 and @entity46 weakened @entity15 and the first half confirmed that			1
for a team in fourth place who had outplayed @entity68 in october , they were never in contention and lucky not to be out of the game at half - time			0
@entity92 was involved in a flashpoint towards the end of the first half after taking a tumble in the @entity15 penalty area the @entity179 defender went down in the penalty area in first - half injury time and that sparked a furious reaction from @entity15 's players @entity3 defender @entity92 goes to ground after a challenge from @entity15 striker @entity118 the goals came a distance apart , after 31 and 62 minutes , illustrating @entity3 ’s control , but it was the sheer weight of opportunity that should impress			1
@entity49 prides himself on constructing robust defensive units , but a conservative estimate suggests @entity3 had 15 chances that could have produced goals , including long - range free - kicks and a series of stunning saves by @entity54			1
@entity198 is not the only @entity89 goalkeeper in top form in the @entity26 right now			2
@entity90 made 103 passes against @entity15 on saturday , almost double any other player on the pitch			2
this was the eighth most in @entity26 history			2
so , yes , @entity3 should have had more , but that is the only quibble			2
it was certainly not for want of trying			0
one day they will catch a team when it all goes right and will run up a rugby score			0
as it was , two were enough			0
@entity63 must really like this time of year			2
his last three @entity26 goals for @entity3 have all come in december — spread across more than a year — although there were just four days between his last two			1
on both occasions , they were the all - important deadlock breakers , and particularly vital on friday after so many misses			0
how he must have enjoyed scoring it in front of those mocking him in the away enclosure , too			0
@entity15 players felt @entity92 tried to trick referee @entity126 into awarding @entity3 a penalty while the @entity179 thought he was caught @entity118 and @entity92 exchange words as a number of players from both sides join in the debate @entity15 's @entity54 , @entity112 and @entity113 join @entity3 striker @entity34 in trying to separate the arguing pair @entity15 players help @entity92 to his feet after they felt he dived in an attempt to win a penalty @entity3 manager @entity57 ( left ) and @entity15 boss @entity49 ( right ) issue instructions to their teams it was a typical @entity3 move — brains and brawn			1
an intricate build - up climaxed with @entity100 surging into the area and winning a corner from a frenzied scramble			0
fabregas curled it in , @entity34 flicked it on and @entity63 popped up , two yards from goal , to tap the ball past @entity54 — powerless , for once			1
the second came shortly after @entity49 had made his big changes , rather negating their impact			0
@entity116 lost the ball in midfield , @entity100 pounced , played it through to @entity34 and he took a trio of @entity15 defenders out of the equation before finishing with a shot low across his body			1
he has been missing a few of late , and he did here as well , but that was a goal of the highest quality , in tune with @entity3 ’s performance			1
the last time @entity15 came to @entity33 , the match finished goalless and @entity57 accused @entity49 of taking football back two centuries			1
he says he regrets such harshness now but , despite @entity15 ’s lofty position , the present was still an awkward place to be for @entity49 ’s men			2
they spent most of it chasing @entity3 , often with limited success			2
@entity276 finishing and a lesser display from @entity54 could have ended in a horrid humiliation , and the opportunities are truly too numerous to record in detail			2
let ’s just say there were chances for @entity98 ( fourth minute ) , @entity93 ( 10 ) , @entity98 ( 16 ) , @entity284 ( 21 ) , @entity98 ( 27 ) , @entity96 ( 29 ) , @entity95 ( 34 ) , @entity34 ( 39 ) , @entity285 ( 42 ) , @entity100 ( 52 ) , @entity96 ( 55 ) , @entity286 ( 65 ) , @entity98 ( 67 ) , @entity95 ( 68 ) , @entity90 ( 69 ) , @entity98 ( 71 , twice ) and hazard ( 81 )			1
apologies if some are missing			0
it was like trying to count a shoal of fishes			0
@entity34 scored on the hour as he fired into the far corner beyond @entity15 goalkeeper @entity54 to double @entity3 's lead at @entity33 @entity34 celebrates his 13th goal of the @entity26 season that gave @entity3 a two - goal cushion over @entity15 a minute applause is observed to mark a 100 years since the @entity299 in @entity300 before the game at @entity33 @entity15 poked fun at @entity57 's ' 19th century football ' jibe last year by posting this picture on @entity305 before the game @entity3 supporters , including one dressed like @entity308 , watch the @entity27 action at @entity33 former @entity164 team - mates @entity90 and @entity45 embrace after the final whistle at @entity33 of those , at least six were kept out by the magnificent @entity54			1
he charged down a close - range shot from @entity93 , a low effort after a forward run from @entity96 , tipped round from @entity95 20 yards out , frustrated hazard cutting inside , flicked over an @entity98 free - kick and cleared off the line after @entity95 tried to replicate @entity63 ’s opener			1
@entity15 had the odd attempt , but their only scoring chance came with three minutes remaining			2
@entity57 is rare among managers in stating he loves the festive fixture pile - up , and lists it as one of the elements of the @entity328 game he most missed while abroad			2
there was no question of him resting players , even after the battering hazard received at @entity87 , and no sign of fatigue as @entity3 left the pitch			0
@entity338 , recalling his time under @entity57 , said there were occasions when the players felt so confident , they could have gone out again a few hours after the final whistle			0
this looked like one of those days			0
the brick wall stood unmoved at the end , as @entity15 wondered what had hit them .			0

@entity3 secure their third straight @entity26 victory on @entity27 at @entity33
@entity63 scored his second goal in as many games to give @entity3 the lead in the first half
@entity34 's strike in the second half secured a win for @entity57 's side over @entity15
@entity63 and @entity95 impressed for @entity3 while @entity54 did his best to keep them out
