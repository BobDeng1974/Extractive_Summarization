' treat him for what he is , ' @entity3 said , referring to @entity35			0
' that does not mean re-ignition of the @entity52			0

' much of his argument dealt with @entity5 's reliance on fossil fuels to drive its economy			0
' @entity5 is a gas station masquerading as a country , ' @entity3 told @entity65			2
' it 's kleptocracy , it 's corruption , it 's a nation that 's really only dependent upon oil and gas for their economy			0
' @entity3 urged the @entity11 administration to use that reliance to pressure @entity5 out of @entity17 using economic sanctions			1
