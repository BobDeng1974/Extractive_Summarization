by @entity0 published : 18:08 est , 27 october 2013 updated : 07:27 est , 28 october 2013 he has a car collection that would n’t look out of place on the starting grid at @entity5			2
on this occasion , however , @entity7 ’s choice of vehicle seemed more suited to his bumbling comic creation @entity11 than the suave millionaire he really is			1
the 58 - year - old actor popped out for a spot of shopping in a relatively modest £ 18,000 @entity16 , a brand once the butt of countless jokes about poor performance			1
@entity7 , who owns a @entity20 , an @entity21 and a vintage @entity22 , has been spotted driving the latest edition to his highly enviable car collection , an £ 18,000 @entity16 @entity7 also owns a 240mph @entity26 which he bought for £ 643,000 in 1997 , now worth £ 3million it is in stark contrast to the £ 3million @entity30 supercar he also owns			1
but perhaps he wanted something a little more conservative before getting back behind the wheel of his prized @entity30 – for which he paid £ 634,500 in 1997 – after crashing it into a tree in 2011			1
earlier this year the @entity38 star successfully claimed £ 910,000 from his insurers to fix the supercar – the highest repair bill ever recorded in @entity42			0
the crash , on the @entity43 near @entity44 , was so bad that @entity7 was forced to claim £ 910,000 on his insurance - making it @entity42 's highest ever repair bill he lost control of the 240mph car , which has soared in value to more than £ 3million in recent years , after veering off a slippery section of the @entity43 near @entity44			1
it hit a tree and burst into flames			0
@entity7 escaped from the wreckage with a broken shoulder , although his vehicle – one of only 64 models in the world – was a virtual write - off			2
most of the back of the car was destroyed while the 6.1litre engine ended up 20 yards away			0
his insurers spent almost eight months considering the claim , before agreeing the massive payout following more than a year of specialist repairs at @entity30 ’s base in @entity70 , @entity71			0
it was estimated that the star ’s car insurance premium will have risen to up to £ 60,000 a year as a result of the expensive crash , which was @entity7 ’s second accident in the supercar ; in 1999 he ploughed it into the back of a @entity80			1
his insurance for the @entity16 is thought to cost about £ 2,000 a year			2
@entity7 , said to be worth £ 71million , owns an impressive collection that includes a @entity83 , a @entity20 , an @entity21 , a vintage @entity22 , a 1939 @entity84 and a @entity85			1
the @entity30 is the fastest non-turbo charged production car in the world at 240mph			2
it does just six miles to the gallon and the engine bay is lined with 25g of gold foil			0
@entity16 , meanwhile , was for many years the subject of ridicule			0
one popular joke was : why do @entity95 have heated rear windows ? to keep your hands warm when you ’re pushing them			0
but in recent years the manufacturer has enjoyed a change in reputation and in 2011 it was named the most satisfying car to own in @entity42			0
not only did @entity16 top the league table of most popular car - makers – beating @entity105 and @entity106 – but four of its individual cars finished in the top ten most satisfying individual models			0
while @entity7 usually aims for laughs , as he did during the opening ceremony of the @entity112 ( pictured ) , he is unlikely to appreciate jokes made at the expense of his new car			1

@entity7 was spotted driving £ 18,000 saloon car to the shops
far *cry* from his 240mph @entity26 worth £ 3million he bought in 1997
comedian also owns an @entity21 , a @entity85 and a vintage @entity22
*blackadder* actor is thought to be worth an impressive £ 71million
