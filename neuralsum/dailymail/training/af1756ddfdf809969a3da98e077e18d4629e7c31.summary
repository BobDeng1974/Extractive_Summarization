dr @entity0 said his methods of communicating with animals are based on science the tales of dr @entity5 have captured imaginations since the books were written nearly 100 years ago			1
and now one @entity9 scientists claims he can do just that using a ' strictly scientific method '			2
after years of research , dr @entity0 will reveal his methods of communicating with pets and livestock at a conference next week			1
he started his work wanting to ask animals questions to check that they were happy with their living conditions and that they were being well cared for			2
dr @entity0 , @entity25 chair in animal welfare at the @entity27 , @entity28 , said his methods of communicating with creatures great and small are based on science , although he has acknowledged similarities to the character of dr @entity5 , the @entity23 reported			1
‘ we are devising ways of “ talking ” to animals and putting questions to them about their welfare and happiness , ’ he told @entity33			0
‘ each species has to be treated differently but the common factor is to devise tests where the animals are offered a choice			2
’ a @entity9 scientists claims he can ' talk ' to animals like @entity5 , played by @entity58 ( pictured ) in the 1967 film the scientist will reveal his methods at a conference about animal welfare and sentience taking place in @entity66 next week , after spending years working with a number of pets and livestock species			1
dr @entity0 is interested in fundamental questions concerning the nature of sentience - the ability of animals to feel sensations - and its relationship to welfare			1
he is also committed to finding solutions to farm animal welfare problems through more applied research			0
his work in the 1980s and 1990s led to changes in the regulation of battery farms for hens and pigs			0
he has also spoken out against the religious slaughter of animals , used to produce kosher and halal meat as he believes livestock animals , from farmed fish to sheep , are smarter than people give them credit for			2
dr @entity0 said : ' it used to be thought that animals were ‘ dumb ’ , driven by programmed instincts and responses , but now it is clear they live a much richer life than we ever realised and can remember the past and think about the future			1
‘ we can use that knowledge to ask questions about their care and then improve it			0

the no more woof headset uses brain - scanning technology to detect a dog 's thought patterns , analyse them and translate them into the spoken word			0
it has been developed by the @entity134 ( @entity135 ) , a small @entity137 research lab. potential dog phrases already identified by the developers include : ' this is splendid ! ' , ' leave me alone ' , ' i am so very weary ' , ' who are you ? ' and ' erm , why are you guys leaving ? ' the technology used in @entity146 is a combination of the latest technologies in three different tech - areas , @entity151 ( @entity151 ) sensoring , micro-computing and special brain - computer interface software			0
in the last decade , huge discoveries have been made to map out the human brain ’s functions , but the developers say it is the first time anyone made a serious attempt to apply this ground - breaking technology on man ’s best friend .			0

dr @entity0 from the @entity27 , @entity28 uses a scientific method to ask animals about their care and state of mind
animals are offered choices in tests and if they make the same choice repeatedly , they want something from people , he said
he will reveal his methods at a conference in @entity66 next week
