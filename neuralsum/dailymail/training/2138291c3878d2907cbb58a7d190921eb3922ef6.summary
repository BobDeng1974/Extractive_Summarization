deserted : @entity52 beach , which was packed full of sunseekers over the bank holiday weekend , was empty today as the weather took a turn for the worse contrast : @entity24 beach in the north east was also packed at the weekend , but the golden sands were deserted aside from a handful of dog walkers today room to manouvre : a vehicle has plenty of space to drive along @entity24 beach today - and the beach looks likely to be deserted over the next few days with wind and rain forecast for much of the country he said : ' there are strong winds in force and so i do n’t know what is going to happen to the boat			1
' the conditions will make it difficult for any salvage operation			2
' if we send a boat out to help , it could get into trouble itself			0
' but the high winds were n't bad news for everyone			0
while the beach 's golden sands were deserted , kite surfers enjoyed rough seas and blustery conditions in @entity24 today as the weather began to take a turn for the worse			1
tomorrow will see the weather become wet , windy and unsettled according to @entity9 forecasters , with strong winds particularly in the south west and southern @entity12			1
safety first : these lifeguards were the only people to be seen on a deserted @entity130 beach today overcast : dark clouds over @entity130 beach today looked ominous as more rain and wind was forecast for the remainder of the week blaze : fire spreading on the moors above @entity138 , @entity139 , on wednesday			1

yellow warnings have been put in place from around 9am tomorrow with an area of low pressure sweeping across from the west of @entity161 to blame			1
a @entity9 forecaster said : ' we 're expecting strong winds for this time of year , but certainly nothing unprecedented			0
' with trees starting to blossom that means they are susceptible to branches breaking off in the wind in some areas			2
' but thankfully because we 've had a late spring the damage will not be as bad as it could be			0
' friday will still be windy but gusts will have significantly died down with showers and plenty of cloud forecast for much of the @entity2			0

a huge crack has appeared along a section of coastline after the latest in a series of rockfalls along 50ft cliffs at @entity191 in @entity192			0
dog walkers raised the alarm after the giant crack opened up above a row of prized beach huts following months of prolonged heavy weather			2
it comes just days after a huge rockfall at @entity202 beauty spot @entity203 sent hundreds of thousands of tonnes of chalk crashing down onto the beach below			0
the incident sparked warnings to walkers to stay clear of the crumbling coastline for fear of repeat rockfalls			2
@entity213 , a dog walker from nearby @entity215 , said : ' i ’ve been watching that crack develop for a year now , and it has definitely got worse over the last few days			2

' there have been a lot of little falls here since january , although nothing too serious			0
' but i understand nothing is going to be done to protect the cliffs , so nature will just take its course			0
' they say it will be about 50 years before it is cut back enough to reach the houses			0
' @entity239 , a resident of @entity191 for 56 years , added : ' it is sad to have lived here all these years and watch the cliff falling into the sea			0
' the slip follows a more substantial slide in february further west which has left part of a nearby car park cordoned off			0
cordoned off : heavy weather has meant that a stretch of land is in danger of slipping on the coast in @entity192 no go zone : walkers have been warned to stay away from the stretch of coast near @entity191 in @entity192 precarious : the crack looks as if it might take a section of this homeowner 's garden with it should it slip into the sea the inclement weather did n't put a dampener on a celebration to mark the end of winter and beginning of spring however			2
dancers turned out in their hundreds for the @entity269 in @entity270			2
