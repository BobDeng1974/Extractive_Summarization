by @entity0 @entity1 completed 45 minutes for @entity2 as they kicked off their pre-season with a 2 - 0 win over @entity7 @entity6			1
the lesser - spotted @entity9 midfielder has made just one appearance for the @entity11 since march 2013 when he tore his cruciate knee ligament , a 14 - minute cameo at @entity14 on the final day of last season			0
but after working hard to regain his fitness , the 28 - year - old made it through the second half of this clash at @entity6 's @entity21			2
but @entity50 could do nothing to prevent @entity76 teen @entity38 from opening the scoring in the 68th minute when he latched onto a sublime @entity35 through - ball before lifting a delicate finish over the onrushing keeper			0
and young striker @entity81 made it 2 - 0 after he won and scored a penalty four minutes from time			0
@entity38 and @entity33 , along with @entity1 , were three of 11 changes made at half time by @entity22 , who played a strong team in each 45 made up of the club 's promising youngsters and the senior players not involved at the @entity90			1
let me take a selife : @entity22 poses with a fan ahead of @entity2 's friendly against @entity6 fan favourite : @entity22 signing autographs for fans upon arrival back in action : @entity1 got a 45 - minute run on his return from injury battle : @entity45 of @entity2 fights for the ball with @entity6 's @entity52 during the first half skipper : the @entity106 was captaining his side on the afternoon on the ball : @entity36 surges forward wrestle : @entity6 's @entity57 and @entity2 's @entity109 go for the ball @entity25 starred in midfield during the first half and almost broke the deadlock in the 31st minute but his low drive flashed a yard wide			1
@entity116 , who also played in the first half , looked lively up front but found @entity50 in inspired form when he was sent clear twice before the interval			0
so it was left to @entity38 , @entity121 – and the rest of the second - half side – to ensure @entity2 started the pre-season activity with a victory			1
@entity22 and his squad head to @entity127 on wednesday , where they will face @entity127 @entity129 , fronted by former favourite @entity130 , before a brief training camp in @entity132 at the end of the month			0
@entity134 : @entity48 gives out some on - pitch instructions control : @entity2 's @entity116 leading the line netted : @entity38 scored the opener			2

@entity2 open pre-season campaign with solid victory at @entity6
@entity38 and @entity81 net in the second half
@entity22 makes 11 changes for the @entity11 at half - time
