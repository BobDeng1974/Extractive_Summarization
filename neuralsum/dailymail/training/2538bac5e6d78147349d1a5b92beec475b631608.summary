the former @entity0 who filmed a porn video in the school 's library is breaking her silence about the incident			0
@entity7 , 19 , of @entity8 , @entity9 , made the video last october for the site @entity12 , and in it was seen topless at times and also touching herself , all while students walked around her in the school library , completely unaware of the young woman 's video			1
then , in january , someone uploaded the video to the popular site @entity20 , making @entity22 an instant celebrity in the adult film world as the video received close to 300,000 views in just a few days before being taken down			1
and while her parents may be upset and the young woman was cited with public indecency , @entity7 is hoping the hype around her library escapades is just what she needs to launch a modelling career			2
she did her first webcam video in october , and in an hour had made $ 150 - and earned plenty of compliments			2
' working a minimum wage job , there ’s people that are just mean to you when they ’re having a crappy day , ' she told the @entity57			1
' on @entity12 , [ users ] had nothing but nice things to say			0
and i made way more than i would working any other job			0
' she started making videos regularly at her home while her roommates were out , including one in which she had sex with a former boyfriend , and then , at the suggestion of one of the site 's users , decided to take her show to a public place			0
that is when she made the library video , which earned her $ 700 for about an hour , and within a few weeks she had made the decision to drop out of college and focus on making videos for the site			0
the young woman 's parents are ' upset ' she says about the video , that saw her touching herself and flashing the camera as unaware students walked around behind her then , in january , she was sitting in her room when she began getting a barrage of friend requests from ' frat boys , ' and then , after checking the gossip app @entity93 , learned that everyone was talking about the ' library girl			1
' her mother also began receiving messages around that time as well , as concerned friends started asking about her daughter , and while there was some relief @entity7 explains when her mother learned she had just filmed a video and had not been hurt , the mother still told her daughter ; ' this is just something you can learn a lesson from and move on			0
' that is not what @entity22 intends to do however , a decision that has now made her parents ' upset ' she reveals , as the offers are not pouring in for the young woman , and she just completed her first professional photo shoot			1
one thing people will not be seeing @entity22 do anymore however is webcam shows on @entity12 - the site has now banned her for violating their guidelines with her library clip			1
she is also banned from the @entity0 campus and last week was arrested and cited with public indecency before being released			0
as for how the video made its way to @entity20 , @entity22 says she has ' no clue			2

@entity7 , 19 , of @entity8 , @entity9 , filmed a webcam video in the @entity131 in which she was topless and touching herself
she did this for the site @entity12 to make money , saying it was better than a ' crappy minimum wage job '
the video was made in october and then uploaded to the popular site @entity20 in january , receiving almost 300,000 views in just days
@entity22 reveals that while her parents are ' upset ' that their daughter is now known as ' library girl , ' she thinks this could be her big break
she has already done a professional photo shoot and says that she has also received *numerous* other offers in the past week
she has been banned from @entity12 , the site she made the video on , for violating their guidelines and filming in a public place
