a @entity1 hunting club that auctioned off a permit to kill an endangered black rhinoceros says it will cancel the winner 's hunt if a federal agency denies his request to bring the dead rhino back to the @entity9 as a trophy			1
@entity11 paid $ 350,000 at a january auction held by the @entity13 for a permit to hunt a black rhinoceros in @entity16 -- a species listed as critically endangered , according to @entity18			1
@entity11 applied for a permit from the @entity20 last @entity21 that would allow him to import the body of the endangered animal from @entity16 after his hunt			2
the agency has yet to give him an answer			0
@entity11 and the @entity13 even received death threats from activists wanting the hunt called off			1
now the opposition may get their wish			0
@entity48 plans to refund @entity11 's money if the agency denies his request			1
@entity48 billed the auction as a fundraising effort to to save the endangered species but the agency is applying extra scrutiny to @entity11 's request because of the rise in poaching @entity18 reports , and the agency is evaluating whether the hunt will result in enhancement of the species 's survival			1
' most people that have an animal mounted , it 's their memory of their experience , ' @entity65 , the @entity13 's executive director , told @entity18			2
' it 's not always , ' look at what i 've shot			0
' when they look at it , they remember everything			0
that 's what he bid the money on , that opportunity			0
' @entity11 told @entity82 in january that he simply wants to experience a black rhino			1
' i 'm a hunter , ' @entity11 said			2
' i want to experience a black rhino			1
i want to be intimately involved with a black rhino			1
' cancel : the @entity13 plans to cancel the hunt of the winner of a black rhinoceros hunting permit if an agency denies his request to bring the rhino 's body to the @entity9 as a trophy @entity96 : @entity11 paid $ 350,000 at a january auction held by the @entity13 for a permit to hunt an older , male , non-breeding black rhino in @entity16 the opposition does n't see it that way			1
many are fervently protesting the hunt and , protester @entity103 told @entity18 that claims that the hunt is ultimately to save the species ' do n't hold water			0
' the agency is holding public comment until dec. 8 and plans to make its decision afterward			0
the agency is taking into account the condition of the critically endangered species and the fact that more than 1/3 of the world 's black rhino population live in the @entity16 herd where @entity11 is to hunt			1
@entity11 , an active hunter who goes on hunting trips around the globe , received the permit to kill an older , male , non-breeding rhino that has been responsible for the death of other rhinos , @entity18 reports			2
and proceeds of the auction reportedly went to the @entity132 trust , a fund run by the @entity16 government in an effort to boost the specie 's population			0
protesters : many are fervently protesting the hunt saying the ' kill it to save it ' logic is cruel and not conservation at all wrong : many protesters hold that the @entity13 's claims that the hunt is an effort to preserve species ' holds no water ' but the culling of old , sick , or problematic animals is a common practice in wildlife management it is a common practice in wildlife management , conservationists say , to kill herds of old , sick , or problematic animals , according to @entity18			2
each year , @entity16 grants up to five permits to hunt the rhinos and this , in turn , funds efforts that protect the species			0
but activists say the ' kill it to save it ' logic is cruel and not conservation at all			0
arguments surrounding the situation have even grown to involve the @entity171 , @entity18 reports			0
@entity48 received death threats like : ' for every rhino you shoot , we 'll kill ten of your members ' and ' the winner of this hunt will find himself in the crosshairs			2
' @entity48 has turned the threats over to the @entity171 the agency must take all arguments into account , and said it will examine how the auctioned funds will be administered			0
but for now , @entity11 's hunt hangs in the balance as both he , and the @entity13 , await the agency 's decision .			1

the @entity13 says it will cancel , the winner , @entity11 's hunt if a federal agency denies his request to bring the dead rhino back to the @entity9 as a trophy
the agency says they have to thoroughly scrutinize @entity11 's request *due* to the rise in poaching
@entity11 : ' i 'm a hunter . i want to experience a black rhino . i want to be intimately involved with a black rhino . '
