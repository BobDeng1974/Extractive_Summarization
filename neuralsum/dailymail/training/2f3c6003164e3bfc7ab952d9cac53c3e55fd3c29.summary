by @entity1 reporter published : 07:24 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 07:24 est , 19 august 2013 we may think of vanity as a quintessentially human trait - but these photographs show that the animal world can be just as self - obsessed			1
when this penguin in the @entity9 caught sight of its reflection in a pool of water , it stood staring at itself for a whole 10 minutes			1
it paraded up and down the edge of the pool in the inlet of @entity19 - and although it repeatedly turned to leave , it kept rushing back to admire itself again			1
vain : this penguin spent 10 minutes admiring its reflection in a pool of water in @entity19 , @entity9 intrigued : the bird appeared to be absolutely fascinated with the sight of itself in the water rare : it is unusual to get ' mirror calm ' conditions because of the @entity9 's stormy weather @entity32 , the photographer who captured the remarkable snaps , said : ' the penguin was standing there for at least 10 minutes in total			1
' it was turning its head from side to side and looking itself up and down repeatedly			2
it was actually looking itself in the eye sometimes			2
' some of the other penguins came to the water 's edge , but they just drank some water from the pool and moved on			2
none of them looked at their reflection			2
' then the vain penguin came along			0
i was quite surprised by its behaviour			0
' @entity57 : the penguin kept walking away and then returning to look at itself once more fascinated : other penguins went to the pool to drink , but did not stop to stare at themselves he added : ' it almost seemed to have a bit of a strut as it left			0
' @entity67 are amazing animals			1
they have enormous character and personality on camera , which always makes for interesting photographs			0
' they are also incredibly tough and resilient creatures ; surviving in one of the harshest environments on earth			0
' mr @entity32 said that it was rare to see such a sight , because the conditions in the @entity9 are usually so windy that pools are almost never ' mirror calm '			1
handsome ? the penguin derived endless entertainment from the sight of itself strut : the penguin appeared pleased when it finally walked away , according to photographer @entity32 he said : ' it 's really unusual to have perfect conditions like this			1
there has to be no breeze at all for a reflection shot like this to work			0
' i ca n't ever remember seeing an animal take such an interest in its reflection before			0
' it was a fantastic experience to witness this behaviour			0
