by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:39 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 17:39 est , 19 september 2012 new justice secretary @entity2 today struck a tougher tone on criminal policy life will be made harder for criminals in and out of prison to rebuild shattered public confidence in the justice system , @entity2 pledges today			1
in his first newspaper interview as the new justice secretary , he issues an extraordinary indictment of his predecessor @entity13 ’s record , admitting voters do not believe justice is being done in many cases			1
he said he would make sure jails – dubbed ‘ holiday camps ’ by critics – are no longer seen as places which convicts ‘ enjoy ’ , while toughening up community punishments to help rehabilitate less serious offenders			2
mr @entity2 , whose appointment in @entity26 ’s cabinet reshuffle earlier this month has cheered the @entity27 , echoed former @entity30 home secretary @entity29 ’s famous declaration that ‘ prison works ’			1
in a deliberate break from mr @entity13 ’s liberal stance , he declared : ‘ i want to be a tough justice secretary			1
’ in a wide - ranging interview , he signalled : mr @entity2 , who replaced mr @entity13 two weeks ago , was brutal in his assessment of the state of the criminal justice system , suggesting it should always operate as it did following last summer ’s riots – when offenders were dealt with in record time and punished severely			1
@entity13 had promised to cut prison numbers when he was justice secretary the minister distanced himself from a number of mr @entity13 ’s policies , which aimed to slash the number of inmates , as the justice department struggles to make savings of £ 2billion			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ i ’m bringing a fresh pair of eyes to the job			1
i ’m very mindful of the need to have a criminal justice system in which people have confidence			1
i think they very often do n’t have confidence in it			0
’ however , he was unflinching in his commitment to mr @entity13 ’s ‘ rehabilitation revolution ’ , saying inmates should be both educated and employed while inside			1
he said far too many freed criminals were ending up reoffending , and suggested paying private firms ‘ by results ’ to help them find jobs			0
but he delivered a clear statement that ‘ prison works ’ – something mr @entity13 stubbornly refused to do			2
mr @entity2 , a former shadow home secretary , said : ‘ prison is really important			1
people who commit serious offences should go to prison			0
but i think prison should n’t just be about deterrent			0
@entity78 should also turn people round so they do n’t keep offending again and again			0
‘ in very many cases , yes , prison does work			0
i do n’t think it works well enough			0
it ’s important to take serious criminals off the street			0
’ he said he wanted a tougher regime for those in custody amid complaints that jails have become too soft , with some convicts even having satellite tv in their cells			2
mr @entity2 warned : ‘ prison is not meant to be a place that people enjoy being in			1
i do n’t [ want to ] see prisoners in this country sitting in cells watching the sunday afternoon match on @entity102			2
’ he added : ‘ am i planning to reduce the number of prison places ? no i ’m not			0
i do not want to set a target to reduce the prison population			0
what i do want to do is bring down the cost of prison			0
the whole philosophy i will bring to the department is getting more for less			0
’ prisoners on a recreation period at @entity114 : mr @entity2 says he would make sure jails are no longer places prisoners ' enjoy ' he also vowed to tackle the use of mobile phones , which are banned inside prison but widely used , with 800 seized every month			1
mr @entity2 said it was vital to bring an end to what he called social media stalking of victims , adding : ‘ it ’s completely unacceptable			1
i ’ve talked to victims of crime who are effectively being stalked by the person who attacked them			2
‘ it is the case that mobile phones are smuggled into prisons			2
we have powers to take tough action on that front , blocking signals , other ways of clamping down on it			2
’ mr @entity2 also addressed repeated criticism that community punishments are too soft			1
he said : ‘ i want to make sure sentences in the community have bite to them			0
i am not opposed to punishments taking place outside of prison , but i want to make sure they really are punishment and not a diversion			2
‘ it needs to incorporate a punitive element			0
’ we can no longer duck making a decision over giving prisoners the vote , mr @entity2 warned			1
the minister said he was ‘ profoundly unhappy ’ that @entity159 judges had ordered the @entity160 to let convicts take part in elections on human rights grounds			2
he also criticised the way human rights law had moved ‘ way , way away ’ from the original intentions of those who drafted the @entity169			1
but he conceded no significant change was likely while the @entity173 @entity172 remained part of the government			0
successive governments have delayed implementing the prisoner votes ruling , which dates back seven years			0
the @entity172 are in favour of criminals voting while @entity30 mps are ferociously opposed			2
mr @entity2 indicated there are likely to be heated discussions over the issue			1
but he said : ‘ we are going to have to take some decisions			0
i ’m not aware of any means of delaying			0
’ his job is to produce concrete proposals for the next @entity30 manifesto			1
this could include replacing @entity193 ’s @entity192 with a @entity160 @entity194			0
teenage knife thugs could face mandatory jail terms after mr @entity2 ordered an immediate review of the law			1
and he could further strengthen homeowners ’ rights to defend themselves against burglars			2
both moves will be welcomed by @entity203 , who have clamoured for tougher sentencing , but would face @entity172 opposition			0
the conservatives were elected on a manifesto promise that anybody guilty of a knife crime should expect a prison sentence			2
but , in a controversial move , then justice secretary @entity13 watered down the commitment			1
currently , four out of five of those convicted of a knife crime do not go to prison			0
mr @entity2 said : ‘ this is an area where i continue to have concerns			1
i am prepared to take action if i need to			0
’ he also pledged to look again at how best to protect those who come face - to - face with an intruder			0
mr @entity2 said : ‘ i have been very clear in saying that i believe householders need to be properly protected by the law if they are defending their homes against intruders			1
