@entity0 has warned that @entity1 will end up ‘ drifting ’ unless a swift resolution is brought to their managerless status			1
drifting , however , just about captures the mission statement from within @entity6 - drift from the calm of mid-table waters and wash up in may on @entity9			2
they do not want to trouble the cruise liners of the high seas , nor do they want to populate the plunge pool which leads to the @entity16			0
@entity0 has urged the club to make a managerial appointment becuase the club are in danger of drifting caretaker boss @entity0 has publicly stated his desire to take on the role on a permanent basis @entity24 said goodbye to @entity1 to take charge of @entity26 earlier this month and that , essentially , is why @entity24 chose to go overboard			1
the new @entity26 boss hinted at as much this week , talking of ‘ battles won ’ and ‘ battles lost ’ with owner @entity31 , at the same time referencing ‘ tight financial margins ’ and the ‘ slow progress ’ policy in place on @entity35			1
perhaps @entity31 should be applauded for surveying the seas and deciding that any attempt to pirate the big boys could see his club drown in misplaced ambition – even pursuit of silverware in the cup competitions is viewed as a threat to staying afloat			2
but supporters – and @entity24 , it seems – have had enough of this @entity49 mandate			1
@entity0 himself is a fan			1
but the caretaker boss – who wants the job on a permanent basis – should be careful when he talks of redirecting his black - and - white ship towards the top of the @entity56 - for he 'll soon be walking the plank with any suggestion of a @entity60 voyage			1
@entity61 puts his gloves during training on thursday ahead of the @entity56 game with @entity64 @entity65 kicks the ball as @entity67 tries to close the @entity68 down during training on thursday ‘ success for this club is to get as high up the table as we can			2
we finished fifth a couple of years ago and that was fantastic			0
so why ca n’t we push fifth , sixth , seventh , eighth ? ’ he said , refreshingly			0
‘ there ’s all this talk about they ( the club ) are happy to sit in the top 10			2
no , go as high as you can			0
set your marker as high as you can and , if you get there , what an achievement			0
‘ we ’ve proved we ’re capable of that and there was the recent run of six wins on the bounce as well			0
’ @entity0 admits that saturday 's trip to league leaders @entity64 and next saturday ’s visit of @entity94 are serving as a ‘ job interview ’ for himself			1
but what he says off the pitch is perhaps as important as what his players do on it			0
former @entity103 manager @entity102 has been linked with the vacant position at @entity1 @entity0 has warned @entity1 that the club is in danger of drifting if an appointment is not made swiftly he has , however , advised managing director @entity109 to avoid a scenario whereby the search for a new head coach drags on			1
‘ i ’ve been in this situation before and if you do n’t do something about it in a short space of time you can end up drifting , ’ he said			2
‘ and what this football club ca n’t be doing is drifting , so a decision has to be made sooner rather than later , for everybody ’s benefit			1
‘ the dressing room is settled at the moment but the longer it goes on it can become unsettled			0
i ’ve been in this situation and it can affect people			0
you can ’ t just let it drift			0
you have to make a decision			0
’ former @entity103 boss @entity102 remains the frontrunner to take charge			1
@entity0 says he would be happy to work under any new appointment , but also believes he himself boasts the credentials to remain in control of his hometown club			1
@entity139 , who has only made three appearances for the club this season , stretches during training @entity144 man @entity144 , who has been linked with a move away , keeps his eye on the ball when asked if he was the right man to lead @entity1 in the long term , @entity0 said : ‘ why not ? people ask me what my qualifications are – well , i ’ve got the @entity152 and that ’s a starting point			1
‘ i ’ve worked with some of the best people in the game , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , sir @entity159 ( @entity160 )			0
‘ if the club said to me , “ take it to the end of the season ” , then i ’d be prepared to do the job , no danger of that			1
i have enough belief in myself and enough time until the end of the season that they ’d say to me then , “ you ’ve done a good job , keep the job ”			0
’ to keep the job , @entity0 must run a happy ship			1
right now , however , it is beginning to seep a little water and the mood on the terraces during the @entity183 defeat at @entity184 was one of mutiny			0
@entity0 , then , is right – an appointment has to be made			2
for drifting can very quickly turn to sinking the longer a ship remains rudderless .			2

@entity24 left @entity1 to join @entity26 earlier this month
@entity102 is the frontrunner to *replace* @entity24 as the new head coach
caretaker boss @entity0 wants to be given the job a permanent basis
@entity0 says the club are in danger of drifting the longer it is left
