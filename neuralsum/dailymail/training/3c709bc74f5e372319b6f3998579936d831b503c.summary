a sense of fairness separates apes and humans from other animals and evolved to promote the benefits of long - term co-operation , experts claim			1
scientists came to the conclusion after studying the ' evolutionary puzzle ' for more than 10 years			0
while monkeys and dogs became upset when treated unfairly , only humans and their great ape cousins voluntarily allowed themselves to be disadvantaged in the interests of fair play			1
a paper co-authored by dr @entity18 from @entity19 reviewed research into the sense of fairness in animals			1
they found only humans and apes have a true understanding of justice			1
both disadvantage themselves to the benefit of others to avoid negative confrontations ( stock image shown ) the trait is not entirely self-less , the researchers note , but rather it is the result of wanting to avoid negative ' pay back ' from a dissatisfied partner and ensure future co-operation			1
the paper reviewing research into the trait was published in the journal @entity43 and was co-authored by psychologist dr @entity18 from @entity19 ' giving up an outcome that benefits you in order to gain long - term benefits from the relationship requires not only an ability to think about the future , but also the self - control to turn down a reward , ' she said			1
crows have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven - year - old , research has shown			2
scientists came to the conclusion after subjecting six wild @entity60 crows to a battery of tests designed to challenge their understanding of cause and effect			0
thetasks were all variations of the @entity68 's fable in which a thirsty crow drops stones to raise the level of water in a pitcher			0
in the ' water displacement task ' , crows worked out how to catch floating food rewards by dropping heavy objects into water - filled tubes			0
they demonstrated an ability to drop sinking rather than floating objects , solid rather than hollow objects , to choose a high water level tube over one with low water level , and a water - filled tube over one filled with sand			0
' these both require a lot of cognitive control			0
therefore , we hypothesise that lots of species respond negatively to getting less than a partner , which is the first step in the evolution of fairness , but only a few species are able to make the leap to this second step , which leads to a true sense of fairness			2
' dr @entity18 and dr @entity105 , from the @entity102 at @entity103 , began their studies of fairness in monkeys in 2003			1
a paper published in nature journal entitled monkeys reject @entity112 featured a study of brown capuchins which became agitated and uncooperative when a partner received a better reward for performing the same task			0
since then further tests on responses to inequity were conducted on nine different species of primate , including humans			0
animals only responded to unfairness when they routinely co-operated with non-related strangers , the scientists found			2
beyond primates , domestic dogs showed evidence of ' first - order inequity aversion ' ( @entity131 ) - the sense of being treated unfairly - and the trait has even been seen in some members of the crow family			1
but the desire to equalise outcomes to the benefit of a partner despite suffering short - term disadvantage was something unique to humans and great apes			1
a paper published in @entity145 featured a study of brown capuchins ( stock image shown ) which became agitated and uncooperative when a partner received a better reward for performing the same task			0
animals only responded to unfairness when they routinely co-operated with non-related strangers , the scientists found the researchers concluded : ' our closest relatives , the anthropoid apes , show evidence of second - order @entity131 ( inequity aversion ) , an essential component of human fairness because it seeks to equalise outcomes			1
' thus , humans and other species seem to share basic reactions to inequity , which serve the need for sustained co-operation			0
' @entity172 ' unprecedented brain enlargement allows for greater understanding of the benefits of self - control in the context of resource division			2
' additionally , the development of language enabled communication about third parties , which may have enhanced the role of reputation building			0
' despite these differences , many of the basic emotional reactions and calculations underlying our sense of fairness seem rooted in our primate background			2

a paper co-authored by dr @entity18 from @entity19 reviewed research into the sense of fairness in animals
they found only humans and apes have a true understanding of justice
both will disadvantage themselves to the benefit of others if it will help them cooperate in the long - term , even if the short - term effects are *bad*
for other animals they felt injustice when they were treated unfairly if , for example , a monkey was given a better treat over another
the researchers conclude that only humans and apes try to be fair
