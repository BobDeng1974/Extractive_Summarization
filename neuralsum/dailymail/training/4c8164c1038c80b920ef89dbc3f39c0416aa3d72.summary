for wine aficionados lacking a corkscrew - or jokers looking for a new party trick - comes the latest innovation sure to blow your top off			0
@entity13 from @entity14 in @entity15 has released a new video which shows how to open a bottle of vino without a corkscrew			1
all you need is a shoe , a wall and a thirst for the grape			1
try to use a shoe with sides that go at least partway up the bottle first , you have to remove the protective foil - or ' capsule ' - covering the top of the bottle			1
then you place the bottom of the glassware snugly inside a shoe , preferably footwear a rubber sole to absorb the shock of the ensuing slam			1
gripping the bottle and shoe , bang the sole against a wall or tree several times until the cork eases out of the bottle			1
then all you have to do is pour			0
but how does it work ? io9.com describes the process of ' cavitation ' this way : ' the bubble of air at the top of the bottle moves to the bottom of the bottle as it gets accelerated backwards			0
the sudden , hard strike of the bottle against the wall compresses the bubble of air			1
' one side of it is being pushed against the glass , the other side has the wine pressing against it			0
' the inside volume of the bottle stays the same size , but suddenly the volume of the air bubble plus the volume of the wine is smaller			0
' once the wine has hit the wall and rebounded , the bubbles that have just been created are pushed up against the cork			0
they burst and push the wine cork up and out of the bottle			0
' apparently the uncouth move is popular amongst restaurateurs and sommeliers			0
but after this video , it 's likely to catch on outside the food and beverage industry			2
cheers to that ! smack it : hit the heel of the shoe against a hard vertical surface like a wall or a tree			2
the shoe will cushion the bottle while the pressure from the blows should force the cork out pour forth : after a few hard knocks , the cork will come out far enough that you can just yank it the grand finale : the cork should be pushed out far enough to enable you to yank it @entity121 is available at @entity122 .			2
