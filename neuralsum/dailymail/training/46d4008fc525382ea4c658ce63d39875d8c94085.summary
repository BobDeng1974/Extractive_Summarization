@entity0 was a goal away from joining the elitist of @entity4 clubs on saturday - but did become @entity6 's all - time top @entity4 scorer			1
the striker scored all four goals in @entity6 's thumping 4 - 1 victory over @entity10 at the @entity11 , but also missed a penalty			1
he has now scored 61 @entity4 goals - moving ahead of @entity14 's in @entity6 's all - time list			1
had the 26 - year - old scored his second spot kick – he took three during the match , scoring two – he would have become only the fifth player to score five goals in a @entity4 match			2
videos scroll down to watch @entity0 struck four goals for @entity6 against @entity10 on saturday @entity0 sent goalkeeper @entity25 the wrong way when converting his first penalty of the afternoon @entity0 reels away having put @entity6 back in front against @entity10 on saturday @entity0 celebrates his four - goal haul nonetheless , @entity0 did add his name to the list of players to score four goals in a game in what proved a memorable performance			1
@entity0 opened the scoring after 13 minutes for the hosts , before @entity39 replied almost instantly for @entity10 after a slip from @entity41 let the visitors in			2
the @entity43 then went on to restore @entity6 's lead as he slotted home from the spot , before missing another penalty before the break			0
@entity0 then netted another penalty and scored another impressive strike after the interval as @entity6 ran out convincing winners			1
last season @entity54 suggested @entity0 was behind only @entity56 and @entity57 among the world 's best players and , now he has apparently overcome the numerous injuries that have plagued him ever since , the @entity6 boss is again of similar opinion			2
@entity54 said : ' it was not easy for @entity63 last year when he had too many injuries			0
you ca n't put in performances like he did today when you 're not 100 per cent fit			0
@entity0 's four - goal haul against @entity10 makes him @entity6 's all - time top @entity4 scorer			1
@entity0 - 61 goals ( 95 games ) @entity14 - 58 goals ( 113 games ) @entity74 - 48 goals ( 115 games ) @entity77 - 42 goals ( 141 games ) @entity80 - 37 goals ( 89 games ) ' but now he 's working very well			2
maybe he will not score four goals in a game again but he will demonstrate why everyone says he 's one of the best players in the world			0
' i have said before he could be a @entity89 player			0
' i have known him a lot of years			0
i saw his career in @entity43 and @entity92 before he came to @entity93 and that 's why i say he 'd one of the three or four most important strikers in the world - not ( just ) because he scored four goals			0
