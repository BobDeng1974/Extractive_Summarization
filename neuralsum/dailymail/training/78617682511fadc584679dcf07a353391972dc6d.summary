by @entity0 @entity1 : 09:00 est , 13 december 2013 @entity2 : 11:36 est , 13 december 2013 a mother - of - two has lost nine stone for the festive season after being horrified by last year 's @entity7 photos			1
@entity8 , 43 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , was ' disgusted ' by her 20 stone frame when she saw pictures of herself at the office party			1
but the receptionist vowed to lose weight in time for this year 's celebrations - and was rewarded for her efforts after she attended her 2013 @entity7 as a size 12			1
' disgusted ' : @entity8 says photos of her at last year 's @entity7 inspired her to lose weight ahead of this year 's festive bash ' someone put the pictures up on the wall at work and i just could n't believe i looked that way			1
i just thought " oh my @entity27 , is that really me ? "			0
it was a real shock , ' she says			0
it was the picture above , where @entity8 is sitting at the table with her husband @entity33 , 56 , that made her decide to change her lifestyle			1
' the more i thought about it , the more i realised i did n't want to look this way by the next @entity7			1
i was determined to do something about it			0
' dazzlingly different : @entity8 attended this year 's @entity7 wearing a size 12 dress @entity8 vowed to lose weight by the time the next christmas party came around and decided to try the @entity43 - a meal replacement programme			1
' i just knew i could n't go on the way i was			0
it was just so unhealthy , ' she says			0
' the nearer this year 's christmas party got , the more determined i was to lose weight			1
and when i finally hit my goal weight i was just over the moon			0
' this year the christmas party was amazing - i felt confident and happy - and i spent all night on the dance floor			2
' @entity8 , pictured a cruise before the weight loss , was ' disgusted ' when she saw pictures from the office party @entity8 tipped the scales at 19 stone 11lbs before she started her diet in january this year			1
' throughout my life , i have always felt the need to feel full , ' she says			0
' i 'm one of four children so there was n't always enough food to go around			0
i think it 's because of this that i always made sure i had plenty of food , and why i over ate			2
i 'd just gorge on pastries and bread and ended up being a size 26			2
' it was n't until my mum had a heart attack in 2010 that my unhealthy lifestyle started to sink in			2
then i saw the @entity7 pictures and i finally realised i needed to change my ways			2
' @entity8 's expanding waistline meant that she struggled to do even the simplest of things			1
' i was so big i struggled to get in and out of bed			0
i could n't manage the housework , i could n't even get in and out of the bath on my own and i could n't put shoes on - my husband , @entity87 , had to do this for me , ' she says			0
' exercise was totally out of the question , my joints ached and i knew i was becoming depressed			0
' but remarkably , @entity8 has managed to lose nine stone in a year and now weighs 10st 11lbs			1
despite not exercising , @entity8 has managed to lose 9 stone in just one year with the @entity95 ' i am now doing all of the things that i could not do before , like walking , bathing and getting out of bed on my own			1
i am such a sociable person these days too , ' she says			0
' it is costing @entity87 a lot of money on new clothes because i am loving the new me and not afraid to show it either			0
' i am exercising every day , using my @entity105 - @entity104 and running all the errands at work			0
' @entity8 , who has two children , aged 24 and 20 , is still sticking to her diet and says she ' feels fantastic '			1
last weekend she attended her office @entity7 feeling like a different woman			1
' showing off my new look at the party was amazing			2
finally i was proud of how i looked , and loved being in all of the photos			2
i wore a sparkly dress and felt a million dollars , ' she says .			0
