@entity0 maintained his slim hopes of claiming the @entity3 a @entity3 title despite missing out on victory on stage 18 atop @entity6 on thursday			1
the conclusion of the 157 - kilometre route from @entity9 featured two ascents of @entity11 and one of the final opportunities to accrue time			0
@entity16 @entity15 beat @entity0 to the line , but the @entity19 leader stole crucial seconds from @entity21 to move second behind overall leader @entity22			1
@entity0 finished second in stage 18 of @entity3 behind @entity25 's @entity16 cyclist @entity15 @entity22 now leads @entity0 by one minute 19 seconds after the @entity26 finished fifth , 13 seconds behind @entity27			1
@entity21 fell to third , 13 seconds adrift of @entity28 and 1min 32 seconds behind @entity22			1
it is unlikely @entity22 will relinquish the red jersey before sunday 's concluding short individual time - trial in @entity32 , but stranger things have happened			2
friday 's 180.5km 19th stage is from @entity35 do @entity36 to @entity37 do @entity38			0
@entity39 was the last of the day 's breakaway riders to be caught , with 15km remaining , ahead of the final finishing ascent			0
@entity42 's @entity22 is unlikely to surrender the lead at this stage of the @entity3 @entity0 's @entity19 squad led the peloton and the @entity48 winner nicked a few bonus seconds at the intermediate sprint with 8km to go			1
the real action took place on the second climb to the finish , with @entity55 attacking			0
the @entity56 has been linked with a move to @entity19 in 2015			0
@entity55 's move was short - lived as a select group caught him and the counter attacks continued , with @entity61 attempting to help their leader @entity62			0
@entity63 then made his move before @entity27 , who began the day in fifth , accelerated			0
@entity0 jumped @entity21 into second place overall , 1 minute 19 seconds behind @entity22 @entity62 followed , with @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity0 chasing him			1
@entity0 then jumped towards @entity27 with 2.5km to go and @entity22 , @entity21 and @entity62 did not follow			2
@entity0 caught @entity27 , with the pair cresting the summit together before making a bid for the finish line			2
@entity27 was able to claim victory , but @entity0 's move saw him enhance his podium ambitions and keep his dream of a possible second @entity75 title alive			0
the top three of @entity22 , @entity0 and @entity21 share a joke before the stage			1
