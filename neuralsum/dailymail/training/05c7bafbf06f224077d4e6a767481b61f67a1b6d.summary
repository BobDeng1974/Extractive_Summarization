when dr @entity25 of @entity30 in @entity5 carried out an internal examination on mr @entity4 , he failed to detect the then 3cm tumour			1
mr @entity4 , who was over the age of 40 , had been complaining of stomach pains and passing blood , but was not referred to the hospital			2
a year later , doctors discovered a 6cm cancerous tumour , starting mr @entity4 on a course of treatment			1
the @entity43 family 's lawyer said if @entity4 ’s cancer had not been missed the first time he may still be alive today			1
@entity48 , from law firm @entity46 , who represented @entity4 , said : ' had dr @entity25 correctly referred @entity4 in december of 2008 he would have been operated on in february 2009 and thus likely avoided the return of the tumour which was at the root of his painful and distressing symptoms and the immediate cause of his death			2
' he also would not have developed cancer in his lungs and he would have likely survived			0
' his wife @entity57 , 38 , said : ' as far as @entity4 was concerned there was nothing to worry about			2
a year after misdiagnosing mr @entity4 's condition , doctors discovered a 6cm cancerous tumour , starting him on a course of treatment			1
he was later given the all - clear after a course of chemotherapy and an operation - but afterwards was told that the cancer had spread to his lungs			1
he is pictured here with his children bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer in @entity75			2
it is a general term for caner that begins in the large bowel			0
symptoms include passing blood and unexplained changes in bowel habits , such as prolonged diarrhoea or constipation , as well as weight loss			0
approximately 72 per cent of bowel cancer cases develop in people aged 65 or older			2
bowel cancer can be treated using a combination of surgery , chemotherapy , radiotherapy			2
if bowel cancer is diagnosed in its earliest stages , the chance of surviving a further five years is 90 per cent , and a complete cure is usually possible			2
however , bowel cancer diagnosed in its most advanced stage only has a five - year survival rate of 6 per cent and a complete cure is unlikely			1
' he was very black and white and if the doctors told him he was fine , then he was fine - he took it as gospel			0
' @entity4 was given some suppositories to treat the piles and that was it			2
' @entity4 was a man ’s man and very proud			0
i really had to push him to go to the doctors in the first place			0
' it was n’t really a normal thing we would talk about			0
' but 12 months later mr @entity4 was still passing blood , prompting his wife to insist he returned to the doctors			1
in september 2009 he visited a different doctor , who performed a rectal examination immediately making an urgent two - week referral			0

mr @entity4 's wife , @entity57 , who is pictured here with their children , said : ' in hindsight he and i wished he 'd got a second opinion or questioned the doctor again when things did n't clear up			1
my advice to anyone is to insist on a second opinion or second examination ' mrs @entity43 said : ' @entity4 was very strong and brave			2
he continued to provide for his family throughout his illness			0
' in hindsight he and i wished he ’d got a second opinion or questioned the doctor again when things did n’t clear up			0
' my advice to anyone is to insist on a second opinion or second examination - even if you think you are being a nuisance - rather than risk what happened to @entity4			0
' doctors are only human - they ’re not 100 per cent infallible - and sometimes get things wrong			0
' i still grieve for my husband and it ’s very painful for me to talk about what happened			0
' however , i made a promise to @entity4 before he died that i would speak out because awareness of his case might help save the life of just one person by getting them to have a check up or ask for a second opinion			0
' after treatment and further surgery to remove the tumour and part of mr @entity4 ’s rectum in february 2010 , the father - of - three endured more chemotherapy			1
the @entity43 ’s then attended an appointment at @entity181 in october 2010 , where they were told by a nurse that mr @entity4 's results were back and were all clear			1

mrs @entity43 said : ' our illusion was shattered when @entity4 ’s oncologist told us in that the cancer was n’t gone had spread to his lungs			1
we were told it was not treatable			0
' it was a tragic blow , which we hoped we would never have to experience			0
mr @entity4 's tragic situation is reminiscent of the recent death of @entity205 teen @entity204 ( pictured ) , who recently passed away after a four - year battle against the disease ' it was devastating to find out the cancer was n’t gone and had spread , after spending the previous months getting our lives back and looking to the future			1
' mr @entity4 continued to work as a road planner but as his condition deteriorated his wife gave up her job as a sales assistant , to care for her husband of 18 years			2
