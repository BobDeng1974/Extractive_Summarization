the cute creatures spend hours creating and chasing bubbles at their watery home in @entity8 aquatic park in @entity9			1
the clever pod of bottlenose dolphins use their blowholes to create rings of air			0
the delightful shots were captured by @entity9 park creator and president , @entity40 , who has worked with dolphins for several decades			1
the 63 - year - old said they were extremely clever creatures which were able to amuse themselves by creating their own toys both in the wild and in captivity			1
@entity49 : the dolphins create vortex rings then bite them so they burst into a series of bubbles initiative : the dolphins can be taught to perform the trick but more often will learn to do it themselves he said : ' dolphins are very complex and social animals , they like to play alone , with other dolphins or indeed with whatever appears between their fins			1
' when they do n't have toys available they create their own			0
air bubbles and air rings are their self - made toys			2
' they create the shapes by blowing air rapidly under the surface of the water			0
sometimes they form rings using the vortex created by their fast swim by injecting air into it			0
' firm friends : park creator @entity40 , 63 , has worked with the dolphins for several decades ' they like to play with their own creations by biting them or following them with their sophisticated sonar system			2
' the talent can be taught by trainers but more often than not one dolphin will learn to do it on its own and the others will copy it			0

intelligent creatures have taught themselves *impressive* new trick
often spend hours creating and chasing their own bubbles at home in @entity9 aquatic park
