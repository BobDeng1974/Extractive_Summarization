by @entity0 published : 18:33 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 21:39 est , 8 november 2012 comedian and author @entity1 has spoken out against @entity4 fans using the chant - click here to read more @entity8 's hat - trick gave @entity4 fans even more to sing about after the @entity10 reassured them they will not face prosecution for using the word ' @entity14 ' in matchday chants			1
@entity17 's police force agreed with the club and their supporters that the ' @entity21 ' songs are not anti-semitic			0
@entity4 fans often sing songs featuring the expression , and did so during their @entity25 clash against @entity27 side @entity26 at @entity28 , where a stunning treble from @entity8 gave them a 3 - 1 win			1
' our guiding principle in respect of the " y - word " is based on the point of law itself - the distinguishing factor is the intent with which it is used ie if it is used with the deliberate intention to cause offence			2
' this has been the basis of prosecutions of fans of other teams to date			2
our fans adopted the chant as a defence mechanism in order to own the term and thereby deflect anti-semitic abuse			2
they do not use the term to others to cause any offence , they use it a chant amongst themselves			0
' the club believes that real anti-semitic abuse such as hissing to simulate the noise of gas chambers is the real evil and the real offence			0
we believe this is the area that requires a determined and concerted effort from all parties and where we seek greater support to eradicate			0
' before kick - off , a smattering of supporters in the @entity75 sang ' @entity21 ' and , after a third - minute corner for @entity4 , the chant grew louder with the whole end joining in			1
then , in clear protest at the criticism levelled at them , @entity4 fans from all corners bellowed : ' we 're @entity4 , we 'll sing what we want			1
' another round of ' @entity21 ' then followed			0
the club released a statement defending their fans ' right to use the expression			2
it read : ' our guiding principle in respect of the " y - word " is based on the point of law - ie. if it is used with the deliberate intention to cause offence			2
' our fans adopted the chant as a defence mechanism in order to deflect anti-semitic abuse			2
they do not use the term to cause any offence , they use it as a chant among themselves			0
' the @entity10 have advised @entity4 that chants such as ' @entity21 ' will not lead to prosecution on the basis that it is used with no ' deliberate intention to cause offence '			1
the @entity113 threatened to report @entity4 to the police if they were not seen to be doing more to ensure the term is no longer used			1
hat - trick hero : @entity8 as a youngster growing up supporting @entity4 , it took me some time to realise the word ' yid ' was an offensive racial slur			1
i 'd never heard it used in a derogatory sense at @entity28 , only ever as a collective term - yid army - and as a positive identifier			0
if a player was good , he was a yiddo			0
but its significance soon became apparent			0
though far from the abhorrent gas chamber hissing of some away fans , it 's still sensitive			0
context is important , though , and its reclamation as a positive term at the ground should not be ignored			0
the @entity113 lawyers says use of the word yid , including the tone adopted by @entity4 fans , amounts to casual racism			1
perhaps they have a point			0
perhaps simply substituting the word would be the answer			0
but @entity4 fans are unlikely to take kindly at being told what to do by an external body , especially as it is largely considered a positive , rather than offensive , chant			1
@entity1 tried to stamp out its use by @entity4 supporters but , despite his own @entity159 faith , the views of a @entity154 fan were never likely to be accepted by the @entity4 majority			1
if the word yid really is to be kicked out of @entity28 , it would need concerns to be raised from within the @entity4 - supporting community , rather than outside pressures			1
@entity166 , life - long @entity4 supporter			1

@entity4 fans protest against @entity170 ' criticism
@entity10 @entity10 advise that chants will not lead to prosecution
@entity8 fires hat - trick as team beats @entity26
