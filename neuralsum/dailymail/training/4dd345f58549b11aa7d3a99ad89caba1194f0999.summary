finally found : the body of @entity1 , pictured aged 20 , has been discovered in an unmarked grave 71 years after his death he took to the skies above northern @entity4 as the @entity5 was unleashed across @entity6			1
it was may 10 , 1940 , and at the controls of his @entity11 aircraft , young flying officer @entity1 ’s brief but heroic war had begun			1
eight days later , the 22 - year - old @entity13 fighter pilot was dead			1
but in his short blaze of glory , the @entity15 ace was awarded a gallantry medal , shot down twice and credited with four outright and three shared enemy kills			1
he died after his plane was shot down over farmland , but because his body was never officially recovered , he was listed as missing in action , presumed dead , for seven decades until historian @entity23 began researching his case			1
he discovered the young pilot had been removed from his wrecked plane on may 18 by locals and buried in the village of @entity29 , near @entity30			1
now his younger brother @entity31 is preparing to lead family members at a dedication service later this year when a new headstone with @entity36 ’s name on it will replace an anonymous one erected by the @entity39			1
mr @entity1 , an 81 - year - old retired stockbroker from @entity41 , near @entity42 , @entity43 , said yesterday : ‘ it is a great relief to know what did happen to @entity1 and where he ended up after all these years			1
‘ we are grateful to @entity23 for finding this out and it means an awful lot that the family have at last a grave to visit so we can pay our respects			2
’ flying squad : @entity1 's squadren sits for an official photograph in a hanger in @entity59 , before being sent to @entity4 rest in peace : fighting officer @entity1 's younger brother @entity31 , 84 , can finally pay his respects at his brother 's grave @entity36 , one of three brothers from @entity66 , signed up with the @entity15 in 1937 , aged 18 , and joined @entity67 a year later			2
at the outbreak of war , the squadron moved to @entity4 as part of the @entity72 , and the young airman ’s first action came on may 10 , 1940 , as @entity75 launched its @entity5 across @entity4 and the @entity76			2
unmarked grave : @entity1 's war grave in the village of @entity80 near @entity30 , @entity4 , will soon be replaced with a headstone with his name engraved on it during his first airborne skirmish , he shot down a @entity85 reconnaissance plane and was credited with playing a part in bringing down a @entity88 warplane			2
the next day he shared two kills – both @entity91 bombers – and on may 13 he single - handedly shot down two of the @entity95 ’s @entity94 fighters			2
he was posthumously awarded the @entity96 for bringing down a @entity98 dive bomber on may 15 that had been wreaking havoc on @entity102 armour during the @entity103 , which was to lead to the @entity105 evacuation later that month			2
in the same action , @entity36 ’s @entity11 was hit by anti-aircraft fire , forcing him to bail out			0
his citation for the @entity96 read : ‘ after his aircraft had been severely damaged by anti-aircraft fire he did n’t hesitate to attack a @entity98 87 over enemy territory and shot it down			0
’ after spending 24 hours walking through enemy territory to get back to his base , the exhausted airman was spotted falling asleep while sitting eating his dinner			0
on may 17 he took off for the final time and his war ended when he was shot down and killed			0
with @entity4 being overrun by the @entity75 , local records detailing the discovery of his body were not meticulously maintained			0
it was only after historian mr @entity23 began his investigation five years ago that he found a witness account of a @entity11 crashing near @entity30 on the same day @entity36 went missing			1
lost at war : the telegram sent to @entity1 's family with the message that @entity1 was missing after a battleon may 17th , 1940 happier times : @entity1 , aged 17 , holds his younger brother @entity131 's hand , aged three , while on a family holiday before the war with the approval of the @entity137 authorities and the @entity1 family , he began excavating the crash site and found parts from the downed @entity11			0
he presented his findings to the @entity15 @entity142 , which , after delving into @entity36 ’s old records , was able to confirm it was his body in a grave three miles from the excavation site			0
mr @entity23 , of @entity146 , @entity147 , who wrote a book entitled finding the @entity149 about his research , said : ‘ the @entity151 had the information for 70 years but it had just been overlooked			0
‘ you have to remember there were 40,000 @entity15 casualties who were unaccounted for by the end of the war			0
‘ a lot of cases were left pending and @entity1 ’s was one of those			0
‘ it was just after we did our examination that they pulled out his file and there was this information all along			0
‘ had he survived , going at the pace he did , @entity1 would have become one of the leading fighter aces of the @entity13			1
‘ he would have been up there with @entity172 and @entity173 , yet history records record him as an unknown airman			0
’ fighter pilots : @entity1 , aged 20 , with his fellow flying aces at an @entity15 base in @entity59 before being sent to @entity4 @entity1 , aged 19 , with his new car and friends shortly after joining the @entity15 as a fighter pilot @entity1 , aged 19 , standing , with his then girlfriend , left , and best friend , sitting down , in @entity66 before he signed up to the @entity15			1
