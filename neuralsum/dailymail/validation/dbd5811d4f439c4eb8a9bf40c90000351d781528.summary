a shameless shoplifter who has spent almost £ 2million on three breast augmentations , luxury holidays and designer outfits has blamed her criminal habit on the government - for not providing enough in benefits			1
mother - of - six @entity8 , 54 , who reportedly lives in a rent - free council house in south west @entity10 and takes home £ 556 in benefits every month , has made almost £ 50,000 a year through stealing			1
appearing on @entity13 's @entity12 , ms @entity8 , who currently receives £ 120 every two weeks in disability living allowance for stress , £ 20 a week for child benefit and £ 58 in child tax credits claimed her 44 - year shoplifting spree had been a ' necessity '			1
they must have something on the side , it ’s impossible			2
i ’m trying to do it and i went without a lot of things			2
i did n’t eat yesterday			2
' i was just stealing to get what i needed at the time , ' she said defending her behaviour			1
' so if there was a birthday - i would go out and get something			1
' when presenters @entity44 and @entity46 questioned the necessity of three breast enhancements she laughed and said : ' my boobs were hanging down here after six kids			2
' but the presenters did not crack a smile			0
' i like to live well , i eat nice food , ' she said			0
the shoplifter , who has been jailed seven times , claimed she is now trying change her ways for the sake of 14 - year - old daughter @entity59			1
' i do n’t want my youngest to model herself on me , ' she said			0
but she was flummoxed when presented with the hypothetical situation of having a broken tv and said she did n't know if she could refrain from stealing to fund a new one			1
ms @entity8 , who last stole @entity64 presents for her children 12 weeks ago , said her habit started at the age of nine when she saw her single mother struggle to bring her up , as well as her eight siblings : ' we did n’t have anything – my mum had a hard time , dad left her and one morning she had one egg between nine kids , she had no money and was crying so i took it upon myself to go and get some food			1
' and that ’s how it started			2
i got so involved i did n’t know anything else			0
' i did n’t want to go without so i just carried on doing it			0
it became a habit , ' she said			0
at her peak the mother - of - six said she was taking home almost £ 50,000 a year through stealing , but is now trying to go straight for the sake of her youngest daughter , 14 - year - old @entity59 ' i went to prison and when i came out i got a job			1
then i got sacked because they found out i ’d been in prison			0
' so then i ’d go back out again			0
i had to have money and that ’s the only thing i could do			0
' sometimes i would steal stuff and then get other people to exchange things and get the @entity101 i 'd sell the vouchers			0
that ’s how you ’d get your money			0
' but pitching herself as modern - day @entity109 , ms @entity8 insisted : ' i 've got good morals – i know it prob sounds a bit stupid me saying that but i ’m not a nasty person			1
' i 've helped people out a bit			0
there are a lot of people who are hard up out there and i 've helped people out with it as well – so that ’s my bit of charity			0
' a lot of people who know me have a lot of respect for me – even though i know it ’s wrong			0
' but ms @entity8 added : ' i do want to try and turn it round now and show people its never too late to change			1
ms @entity8 says she has made almost £ 2million from a 44 - year crime spree while enjoying designer clothes , exotic holidays and expensive beauty products ( pictured above ) ' i would do anything along as it ’s a job			1
i do n’t get a buzz stealing – but when i do buy with money i get a rush from that			2
' i do n’t want to be on benefits – if someone would give me a job			0
' in a clip showing ms @entity8 in her front room , the obsessive shoplifter bragged : ‘ everything in this room i have shoplifted the money to pay for the stuff – sofas , tvs and light			1
' well i bought one and stole one , ' she qualified pointing to her light fittings			0
in an interview with the @entity156 this week , the mother - of - six described shoplifting as her ' job '			1
in contrast to her claims on @entity12 , she told journalists @entity161 and @entity163 : ' i will try but i 'm going from ­ riches to rags			2
why would i give up living like an a-lister for this ? ' this is the longest i 've been without shoplifting since i was a child and it 's unbelievably hard			2
' ms @entity8 said she first stole aged just nine			1
after she went unchallenged as she took a haul of groceries from a supermarket , she said she began stealing food and toys on a weekly basis			2
she was arrested aged ten for stealing a badge , but no action was taken against her , the people reported			2
@entity8 leaving the @entity12 studios after chatting about her prolific shoplifting at 14 she was expelled from school and despite two youth detention sentences she decided at 16 to make shoplifting her full - time job - disguising herself with wigs or make - up to avoid being caught			1
' i used to nick a load of stuff then go and have a cuppa with the security guards , that 's how good i was			0
when i had been doing it for a few years i realised it was more about attitude than anything else			0
i could steal anything , ' she said			0
on one occasion she said she even managed to steal a cooker with the help of an accomplice and a van , but reportedly made much of her money by stealing from designer clothing shops and having other women return the items for vouchers or credit notes			2
she then sold these on for half the price , but would also make money by shoplifting to order			2
after she married in her 20s and started a family of her own , ms @entity8 even trained up her three eldest children to help her once they turned 12 , she told the newspaper			1
she says she was stealing items worth as much as £ 7,000 a month , taking home nearly £ 50,000 a year after paying her accomplices			1
but although ms @entity8 said she turned to crime to support her family , it also caused the break - down of her marriage and when she was sentenced to one of her jail terms her three eldest children were sent to live with her father			1
according to the people , ms @entity8 has more than 50 shoplifting charges to her name , but she said this accounts for only around one per cent of her exploits			1
she was last jailed when @entity59 was six weeks old , but told the newspaper that on the day she was released from the six - week sentence she went on a stealing spree			1
she said she is now hoping to change her ways for @entity59 , but does not want to give up the perks of her lifestyle			0
she said she does want to find legal employment , but added that if she is unable to get a job she may resort to stealing - and says the government should give out more in handouts to prevent others from turning to crime			1
she said : ' there 's no way i can maintain my lifestyle or anything close to it			0
the government is living in denial if it thinks people are going to live on benefits and not do everything they can to top it up , illegal or not			0
