the scoreline was deceiving at @entity1 on wednesday evening			0
yes , @entity2 scored three times against @entity4 but the performance did not do anything to silence the doubters of @entity9 's side			1
here , @entity11 's @entity10 looks at what we learned from @entity2 's 3 - 1 victory over @entity4			1
@entity15 ( left ) celebrates his penalty with @entity17 ( centre ) and @entity19 ( right ) @entity20 ( third left ) scores his second goal of the evening against @entity4 on wednesday @entity2 manager @entity9 saw his team given a tough time by relegation strugglers @entity4 @entity17 , defensive midfielder ? @entity2 fans had called on their talisman to be shifted upfront from his place on the right of the diamond , bemoaning a waste of his attacking talents			1
like having @entity32 and leaving it in the garage , said some			0
little did they realise that when he was moved it would be backwards take over the holding role from the injured @entity38			0
a bizarre sight , @entity17 cleaning up in front of the back four but credit to the @entity44 man , he took on the responsibility like a captain and led his team to victory			2
@entity17 ( second left ) dropped further back into midfield after @entity38 went off injured blind ( centre ) hobbled off in the first half and @entity17 filled in and played the rest of the game in his place @entity54 has not been kidnapped has played just 56 minutes this year with conspiracy theorists in meltdown			1
had he run over @entity59 's cat ? did he follow @entity60 to @entity61 ? at £ 29m the @entity63 's first signing has hardly been given a chance to impress			0
tonight , however , he got it			0
when he came off the bench to replace the injured @entity66 erupted in ironic cheers			0
will have enjoyed a rare run out but did not do much to leave @entity2 fans wondering what they have been missing			2
no doubt desperately short of match fitness			0
@entity54 ( centre ) replaced @entity38 when he went off injured after 39 minutes at @entity1 @entity54 ( left ) did not do much to impress during the 51 minutes he played for @entity2 against @entity4 are the natives getting restless ? they have been resolute in their backing for @entity9 but are @entity2 fans reaching the end of their tether ? consensus in the press box was that the prolific @entity20 's second goal on the stroke of half - time saved @entity59 's men from being booed off at the break			1
credit to them , though , while shouts of frustration were audible this is still an onside crowd who back their man			0
chants of @entity9 's red and white army started in the @entity95 and seemed to lift @entity2 a level			1
like last year under @entity97 , they deserve credit			0
watching @entity2 is not as fun as it used to be			2
the @entity2 supporters were frustrated at their team 's performance , especially in the first half @entity20 's second goal for @entity2 shortly before the break helped ease the supporters ' nerves in the game is the problem of @entity109 being solved ? this was more like it			1
playing on the left of the diamond and terrorised @entity4 on the break and relished getting out wide			2
he had come under - fire for lacking desire but covered every blade and even landed himself in the book for a late challenge which will have delighted the @entity2 faithful			1
laid @entity20 's second on a plate from a short corner that worked			1
a short corner that worked ! won the penalty and finally began to look at home in a red shirt			0
yes , tougher challenges lie ahead but this was impressive from the £ 59.7m man			0
@entity131 ( right ) impressed in @entity2 's victory and his commitment to the cause will please @entity2 fans @entity109 ( lower ) was brought down by @entity136 to earn the penalty that team - mate @entity138 converted @entity139 is the real deal it 's not hard to stand out in @entity4 's tin foil away kit but @entity139 shone the brightest with a zesty performance that caused @entity2 's defence no end of problems			1
almost unplayable in the first - half with no disrespect to @entity151 's @entity150 battlers you get the impression that in a stronger side he might have a similar impact to @entity156 at @entity157			2
he really does look that good			0
striker @entity139 ( right ) found the net for his fifth goal in six @entity162 games on wednesday @entity139 ( left ) moves past @entity17 ( right ) and impressed once again for @entity4 despite his team losing			1

@entity2 were made to work for their 3 - 1 win over @entity4
two goals came from @entity20 as @entity15 scored a penalty
striker @entity139 had equalised for @entity4 in another impressive *display*
@entity9 : @entity17 can solve @entity2 midfield problem
@entity17 in midfield ? @entity11 's *experts* pick their @entity176
