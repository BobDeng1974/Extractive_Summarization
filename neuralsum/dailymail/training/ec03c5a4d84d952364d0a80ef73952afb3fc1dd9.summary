by @entity0 published : 09:46 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 14:09 est , 24 july 2013 @entity1 professes her love for her husband in an unfortunately - timed essay in @entity5 which came out just hours after another woman revealed the sex chats she had with the disgraced former congressman			1
the article comes as a vow of support for his bid to become @entity15 's next mayor , and was released the morning after the notoriously private @entity1 spoke out at his press conference tuesday where he confirmed that he will not be dropping out of the race			1
' people have said many things about my husband â€” some nice , some not so nice			2
and that will surely continue			0
launching this campaign was not an easy decision for our family to make			0
putting yourself out there comes with a cost , ' she wrote in @entity5			1
in a column that will appear in the magazine 's september edition , the longtime @entity33 aide tells how she went from being a ' single workaholic ' to a wife and mother in a matter of three years			0
i believe in him ' : @entity1 read a statement at the tuesday press conference reaffirming her belief in her husband and their marriage facing the backlash : @entity51 addressed reporters in front of his apartment building on wednesday morning but he did not have his wife at his side this time when her husband @entity51 launched his campaign to run for mayor of @entity15 two years after resigning from @entity61 amid a @entity63 sexting scandal , he said that there were other women who would come forward with allegations against him			1
opening up : @entity1 wrote an essay in the upcoming issue of @entity5 about how she decided to forgive her husband and supports his run for mayor in the essay , she said that in addition to being the ' smart , caring , and dedicated person ' he has always been , ' he is now something else - a better man '			1
what @entity1 likely did n't know was that one such woman would release screen grabs of her virtual conversations with @entity51 and the naked pictures he sent of himself - just days before the @entity5 issue hit newsstands			1
' @entity15 will have to decide for themselves whether or not to give him a second chance			2
i had to make that same decision for myself , for my son , for our family			0
and i know in my heart that i made the right one , ' she wrote in a preview of the piece that was posted on the magazine 's website			2
though @entity1 has worked for @entity33 for nearly two decades , starting when she was an intern in the @entity99 and worked for the then - @entity100			2
in her role as mrs @entity33 's top aide , she has kept to the sidelines , leaving her boss to be the focus of attention			0
' i kept my personal life private , even as the people i was close to lived in the public eye			0
but all that changed two years ago , and @entity51 and i have spent these past few years working through the very private challenges we faced on a very public stage , ' she wrote in @entity5			1
her husband 's bid for @entity117 changed all that			1
she first appeared in one of his campaign ads and made her press conference debut on tuesday when she read a statement in defense of her husband			2
public defense : @entity1 broke her notoriously private shell by appearing alongside her husband a year after he resigned in a july 2012 people article			1
it was revealed he maintained online relationships even at that time ' when we faced this publicly two years ago it was the beginning of a time in our marriage that was very difficult and it took us a very long time to get through it , ' ms @entity1 said at today 's press conference			1
together : in the @entity5 article , @entity1 talks about how she went from being a ' single workaholic ' to a wife and mother in three years , seen here at their 2010 wedding ' @entity51 's made some horrible mistakes both before he resigned from congress and after but i do very strongly believe that that is between us			1
' for his part , @entity51 said that his wife was aware that he was still making contact with women he had never met even after he resigned , and he said that his june 2011 departure from @entity61 was not the end to his inappropriate behavior			1
' she knew all along this process as i was more and more honest with her , i told her everything so this is something we knew going into this season of ( campaigning )			0
' i 'm pleased and blessed that she has given me a second chance			0
for the past several months i have asked @entity15 to give me a second chance			2
' its in our rear view mirror but it 's not far and we continue to work on our marriage			0
frankly we 're in a lot better place today or else i would not have run for mayor			0
' many public figures have come out to support @entity1 , praising her remarks at the press conference , including @entity173 who called her ' impressive '			2
congressman @entity174 , who has been the @entity175 representative for @entity176 for over 40 years , echoed those sentiments on @entity178 wednesday morning			0
' nobody that i know understands at all what @entity51 was thinking about			2
and right now , i think you would agree that we all are concerned about his wife			0
she 's a brave lady , ' congressman @entity174 told @entity178 on wednesday			0
' i have seen a lot of things like this in politics where males have to lean on their wives for support , but i do n't ever recall seeing a wife looking and feeling so sad and embarrassed , because @entity1 is a very private person , a very delicate , sophisticated person			2
and all the years that i 've known her , putting her into this political situation , as bright and as intelligent as she is , is very awkward			0
' in spite of her claims that his sexual proclivities are a personal matter , they have made a very purposeful - and planned - re-entry into public life with a number of interviews			0
the first came in the june 30 , 2012 issue of @entity205 , where they posed for a family portrait and @entity51 opened up about how they had worked through their problems			1
on the sidelines : @entity1 has been working for @entity33 ( pictured here in 2012 when she was serving as secretary of state ) since 1996 and is considered one of her top aides now the ' normal family ' that they claimed to be is seen as even more of a facade as it was revealed yesterday that he began exchanging explicit messages and photos with a woman online less than two weeks after the @entity223 issue hit newsstands			1
he would not go into the specifics of when he began talking with the woman who has since been revealed as @entity227 , but she told gossip site @entity229 that their first contact took place on july 12 , 2012			1
to many that came as a shock because it was assumed that his inappropriate behavior came to a stop after he resigned from @entity61 in june 2011			1
@entity239 was revealed to be a blogger for the @entity241 who worked as a part of president @entity244 's field campaign during his 2012 bid for re-election			1
warning graphic content the latest woman : @entity239 , 23 , was identified as the one who @entity51 was talking to online in 2012 virtual exchange : she released screengrabs of their conversations and pictures of his genitals that he sent she sent screenshots of conversations she had with @entity51 over social media site @entity261 , where he used the screenname ' @entity227 ' and described his sexual fantasies , such as : ' so i walk in to a hotel room and you are at the end of the bed			1
naked except for some amazing f * * * me shoes			0
your legs are * * * * * *			0
your feet are flat on the ground you are leaning slightly forward			0
' photos : the @entity229 also released two pictures that the unidentified woman claimed @entity51 sent her of his genitals ' i like to whisper in your ear while i make love to you			1
that ok ? ' he wrote			0
wan na join me ? ' ' staring at pics of @entity288 ? ' ' if i met you in a bar and tried to talk to you , would i have a chance ? ' ' you are a walking fantasy			0
' the publisher of the dirty is @entity294 , who wrote tuesday that the then - unidentified woman has hired a lawyer ' in fear of @entity51 but she is willing to expose his sexual nature to @entity298 for the betterment of @entity300 '			1
she released a statement through the site : ' although i was 22 and technically an adult , i was obviously immature and i acted irresponsibly			0
i realize my correspondence with mr @entity51 was a huge mistake and i am embarrassed by it			2
