imagine if @entity0 had actually done something wrong			1
imagine if he had not turned up for training			1
imagine if he had refused to play			1
imagine if he had gone on strike			1
imagine , even , if he had asked for a transfer away from @entity5			1
imagine the opprobrium that would have been heaped upon him then			1
because as it is , he has been labelled an ingrate and a fool			2
he has been called avaricious , capricious , disloyal and impressionable			1
he is in thrall , it is said , to a man portrayed as his @entity15 of an agent			2
@entity0 ’s ability has been questioned and his contribution to @entity5 has been mocked			1
his character has been traduced and scorn has been poured upon the notion that he will ever amount to anything			2
for what crime exactly ? well , to be honest , it ’s hard to say			2
@entity0 winces during @entity5 's 4 - 1 defeat at @entity26 to complete a tough week for the 20 - year - old @entity28 takes a deep breath as he watches his side succumb to their worst defeat of the season @entity0 is fouled by @entity34 as @entity5 earn a penalty which was converted by @entity36 ok , so he has not signed the lucrative new contract that the club have put in front of him			1
given that he has more than two years left on his existing one , that is hardly a heinous act or a trigger for angst			2
he wants to wait to the end of the season , he says			2
he gave an interview to the @entity48 that he had not cleared with the club			1
not particularly clever , admittedly			0
and , yes , the reference to being ‘ flattered ’ by @entity26 ’s interest , particularly coming a couple of days before the clash between the two teams at the @entity55 , was naïve			0
but the content of what he said was hardly incendiary			0
it amounted to a softly - spoken plea for time and space			1
@entity0 is not the kind of person to shout the odds			1
maybe he wants a little while to make up his mind			0
that ’s not what @entity5 fans want to hear but it happens			1
for what it ’s worth , i hope @entity0 stays at @entity78			1
i hope that sooner or later , he signs that new contract , or perhaps an improved version of it			1
at this stage of his career , leaving @entity5 is fraught with unnecessary risks			1
@entity5 are a great club and they are on the rise again			1
they are staffed by good , intelligent , forward - thinking football people			1
and i ca n’t think of any better manager than @entity28 under whom @entity90 should continue the process of maturing into one of @entity94 ’s best players			1
the 20 - year - old gave an interview to the @entity48 on wednesday , giving his opinion on a variety of matters @entity28 called the interview ' a mistake ' and shakes hands with his protege the day after its airing @entity0 's agent @entity106 is pictured sat next to @entity107 ( centre ) at @entity109 but none of that means i have n’t found the virulence of the reaction to @entity0 ’s refusal to sign immediately on the dotted line somewhat startling			1
the kid is only 20			0
this is , after all , an old storyline			0
we talk about loyalty in football as if it is a one - way street			1
we only apply it to footballers , not to clubs			1
clubs generally have very little loyalty to players			1
they treat them as commodities			1
or ‘ expensive pieces of meat ’ , as @entity135 would have it			0
and we do n’t blink an eye			0
they pay the players well when they are worth something to them			1
they pay them to entertain their fans			0
and to sell season tickets			0
and to allow them to keep harvesting the vast amounts of @entity148 television income flooding into their coffers			0
and to lift them into the @entity151 , where they accrue even more cash			0
for the club owners , for the men who pay the wages , the relationship with a player is a business transaction			1
and when the player stops playing as well as he used to , when he loses his form or when he grows older and slower , or when they want to replace him with another player , they get rid of him			0
@entity28 remains confident that @entity0 will stay and the situation will be resolved in the summer it ’s about money			1
it ’s that way at @entity169 and at @entity170			0
it ’s that way at @entity26 and at @entity172			0
and it ’s that way at @entity5 , too			1
it ’s the way it is and none of us question it			0
and yet we do not apply the same standards to players			2
we expect hard - headed business sense from the clubs but we demand that any nod to rationality is cast away when it comes to the time when players make decisions about their future			1
in its stead , we demand sentimental attachment from the players to override everything			2
we are terribly old - fashioned about it			2
the players should be grateful , we seem to be saying , because @entity193 got the maximum wage abolished in 1961			2
there are a few , at least , who see the contradictions in that stance			0
‘ @entity0 is fully entitled to make his own mind up , ’ @entity199 wrote on @entity200			1
‘ make choices that will prove to be right or wrong			2
it ’s his life , his career			0
i hope @entity0 stays at @entity5 but if he asks for time to think before he commits himself , it is absurdly unjust that he should be pilloried for it			1
black managers always get the worst jobs if you are an aspiring manager in @entity213 football and you are black , you get used to one thing : when an opportunity comes your way , it ’s going to be the managerial equivalent of a hospital pass			2
sorry , but it ’s true			0
with a few exceptions , you do n’t get the better opportunities			0
you get the football version of mopping up the toilets			2
@entity224 , the only black manager in the @entity148 , is a classic example			0
@entity224 is a fine coach who has been overlooked for countless jobs			0
he took the @entity228 position after @entity229 , a talented , experienced manager with a good track record of rescuing clubs in trouble , saw the writing on the wall and got out			2
@entity224 was asked to board the sinking ship and , guess what , it has not been an easy job to refloat it			0
before the victory at @entity240 , @entity228 were sliding deeper into trouble and there were already those seeking to blame it on @entity224			0
@entity224 ( right ) and @entity245 watch @entity228 hammer @entity240 to keep their survival hopes alive @entity249 ' troubled reign at @entity250 ended after an infamous @entity252 defeat by @entity253 just as predictably , there were also those saying @entity224 ’s struggles were an indication black managers tend to fail on the rare occasions they are given a chance			0
if @entity224 is sacked , people will say it was about results , not race			0
and they will be wrong			2
because race was why he had to take the job in the first place			0
people tend not to like inconvenient truths about why there are so few black managers in the @entity213 game			0
some got angry again when @entity249 suggested a manager on a bad run will get sacked sooner if he ’s black			0
the fact @entity224 has been labouring to turn things around at @entity228 does not mean he is not a good manager			0
it just means that when your only chance in the game is to accept a hospital pass , the odds are you ’re going to get hurt			0
it was my first visit to the @entity288 on tuesday and it was hard not to be impressed by the arena ’s steep sides , excellent facilities , spectacular location and fine atmosphere			0
it was also hard not to notice that at a stadium with a capacity of just 41,000 , there were 10,000 empty seats for a friendly against another major footballing nation			0
the @entity288 is a magnificent venue , but fans stayed away from the midweek international friendly a fan takes a selfie in the midst of a sea of empty seats in @entity310 with only 31,138 watching the game @entity312 played to a crowd of 83,671 as they cruised past @entity315 lightweights @entity316 4 - 0 at @entity317 a few days earlier , more than 83,000 fans had packed into @entity317 for @entity312 ’s @entity320 qualifier against @entity316			2
@entity213 football might have plenty of problems but the loyalty of its supporters is not one of them .			1

he has not signed the lucrative contract @entity5 waved in front of him and he gave an interview to the @entity48 without clearing it with the club
but imagine if @entity0 had actually done something wrong
he has been called avaricious , capricious , disloyal and impressionable
we talk about loyalty in football as if it is a one - way street
clubs generally have very little loyalty to players . they treat them as commodities
if he asks for time to think before he commits himself , it is absurdly unjust that he should be pilloried for it
