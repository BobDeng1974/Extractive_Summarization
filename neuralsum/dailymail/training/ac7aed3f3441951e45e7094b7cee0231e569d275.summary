however , one software engineer used the latest in computer modelling to show us the red planet might once have looked like when there was an abundance of water - and it is remarkably @entity14 - like			1
the incredible images show a lush , green @entity2 with cloud , greenery and oceans			2
@entity2 reimagined an an earthlike planet : a @entity21 software engineer manupulated real @entity23 data from the red planet to show it an an earth like planet ' this is a view of the @entity29 with @entity30 on the horizon beyond the @entity33 volcanoes and the @entity35 canyons near the center , ' @entity27 , a software engineer from @entity21 , said of the above image			1
he began the project using topographical data from @entity23 to create a 3d model of the red planet			1
' the resulting model was then brought into @entity43 ( painting software ) were i painted in land features using a @entity48 image for the source textures , ' he said			2
' there is no scientific reasoning behind how i painted it ; i tried to envision how the land would appear given certain features or the effects of likely atmospheric climate			2
' for example , i did n’t see much green taking hold within the area of @entity30 and the surrounding volcanoes , both due to the volcanic activity and the proximity to the equator ( thus a more tropical climate )			0
' for these desert - like areas i mostly used textures taken from the @entity68 in @entity69 and some of @entity70			2
' likewise , as the terrain gets higher or lower in latitude i added darker flora along with tundra and glacial ice			0
' these northern and southern areas textures are largely taken from around northern @entity77			0
tropical and subtropical greens were based on the rainforests of @entity80 and @entity69			0
' @entity2 as you 've never seen it before : a software engineer created an image of the red planet as it may once have looked , using @entity23 's iconic ' blue marble ' image of @entity14 as inspiration the @entity2 as we are more used to seeing it - dry and dusty he then scripted the model to apply a three - dimensional cloud layer , add an atmosphere , and dampen specular lighting on dry land and under clouds			1
however , @entity98 admits his model may not bee scientifically accurate			0
' this was n’t intended as an exhaustive scientific scenario as i ’m sure ( and expect ) some of my assumptions will prove incorrect			0
' i ’m hoping at least to trigger the imagination , so please enjoy ! ' one of the topographical maps created by @entity23 that mr @entity27 used to create his models @entity98 then used computer software to alter the colour of the images , to make them more ' earth - like '			1
he says he based the colours of similar geographical areas on @entity14 one of @entity23 's iconic ' blue marble ' images , which show the @entity14 from space complete with clouds			1

incredible images created using @entity23 data from the red planet to map it in 3d
images were then coloured to *reflect* regions on earth with similar geographical features , with an earth - like atmosphere and clouds added
