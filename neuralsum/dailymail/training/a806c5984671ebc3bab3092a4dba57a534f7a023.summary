it was six months after the family gp diagnosed an eating disorder that they discovered the truth was much worse			1
their daughter had a brain tumour which would eventually kill her			1
@entity2 underwent a major operation and months of chemotherapy following the correct diagnosis , but the cancer returned and she died earlier this month , aged 11			1
yesterday the grieving family spoke out about the tragedy			1
‘ given the time frame , it is possible it might not have spread if @entity2 had had her operation earlier , but nobody will ever know , ’ said her father @entity24			1
@entity2 first started being sick in august 2010 after returning home to @entity32 , @entity33 from a holiday seeing relatives in @entity36			1
the family ’s gp said that she was suffering from stomach problems , leading to fears that she had an eating disorder			2
after @entity2 was examined by a hospital paediatrician , she was given a prescription of tablets to treat acid reflux , but over seven months she was sick every morning and lost nearly 9lbs			1
‘ her appetite started going – she was never a fussy eater and always had a fantastic appetite , ’ said her mother @entity46 , 34			2
‘ we would try and tempt her with her favourite foods , but it just was n’t happening			2
‘ that ’s when i thought it was possibly an eating disorder			2
‘ she has never been image conscious , but i could n’t think of any other reason			2
‘ i know how some girls are these days seeing all the celebrities in magazines and on tv , and i tried to catch her out			2
‘ we had rows about it and she would get really upset			2

warehouse manager mr @entity103 , 44 , will trek across the @entity130 with colleagues next year to raise money for @entity133			1
he said : ‘ we just ca n’t believe how little money and effort goes into raising awareness about brain cancer and the symptoms			1

‘ yet brain tumours kill more women under the age of 35 than breast or any other cancer			0
‘ doctors and families need to be more aware of the deadly threat of brain tumours in children			0
‘ we just want to make parents and doctors aware that if a child is constantly being sick that it may be a brain tumour			0
