i always liked his songs			1
' the hashtags # @entity35 and # @entity37 were trending as stunned film fans struggled to come to terms with their loss			2

however , @entity44 was not impressed with the errors			2
he tweeted : ' hi			2
please do n't embarrass yourself			2
@entity3 and @entity15 are n't the same people			0
