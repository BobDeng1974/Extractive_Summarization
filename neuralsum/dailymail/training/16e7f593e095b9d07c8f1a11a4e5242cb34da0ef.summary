by @entity0 these amazing pictures show life on board the @entity5 ship working around the clock in the southern @entity7 in the hunt for missing flight mh370 and its back box			1
the captain of survey ship @entity12 said the search for the missing @entity16 flight is proving ' challenging ' , but that the crew are working 24/7 to help the search efforts			1
@entity19 disappeared on march 8 with 239 people on board , sparking an international effort to find out what happened to it			2
survey ship @entity12 , as a @entity25 flies overhead , in the southern @entity7 helping in the underwater search for the flight recorder from the missing @entity19 hydrographic survey ship @entity12 was diverted from its work in the @entity7 to help in the hunt , and arrived on thursday in the area of the southern @entity7 where ' pings ' thought to be from the missing plane had been detected			1
according to @entity37 prime minister @entity36 , the search area has been significantly narrowed down in the hunt for the ' ping ' signals which authorities are confident are from the missing jet			0
however , he said the signal from the @entity45 's flight data and cockpit voice recorders is fading - batteries powering their locator beacons last only about a month and it has been more than a month since the plane disappeared			2
the ship has been diverted from its regular duties to assist in the search for the missing plane since ' pings ' were heard coming from the ocean earlier this month the ' pings ' were possibly emitted by the @entity58 flight 's black box , which puts a strict time limit on the search , as the black box only has about a month of battery power , and has been missing for a month already working alongside ships and aircraft from seven other nations , the two @entity5 vessels face the same race against time to find the black box flight recorder @entity37 vessel @entity69 , which is towing a @entity71 device to detect signals from the beacons , first picked up two underwater sounds consistent with the ' pings ' a week ago , followed by two more in the same general area on tuesday			1
those involved in the search are trying to pinpoint the location of the source of the signals so they can send down a robotic submersible to look for wreckage and the flight recorders			0
@entity12 , whose specialist equipment has been specially adapted to pick up sonar pings from the jet 's missing black box , is supporting @entity69 by understanding the signals it is picking up , its commanding officer said			1
crew of the @entity12 , @entity93 and @entity94 , prepare the ship 's @entity95 for deployment speaking from the ship today , commander @entity98 said they are working in conditions after inclement weather caused difficulties interpreting signals picked up underwater			2
he said : ' it 's been challenging			0
over the last couple of days we have been conducting oceanographic observations to support @entity69			0
' the key thing is to help their understanding of what is going on , and how it is affecting the ocean column			0
' he said there had been some difficult weather conditions which had ' messed up ' the water column , making it hard to understand some signals being picked up			0
sailors from @entity12 prepare one of the ship 's @entity123 ( conductivity , temperature and depth ) probes for launch into the southern @entity7 he said : ' the key challenge is to try and refine all of the observations they are making			1
they are doing that at the moment but it 's challenging			0
' looking out of the window right now , what we are seeing is @entity69 to the south of us conducting further observations			0
' she is trying to get in a position so she can then observe on the seabed , and then through the water column , the pings from the black box , which involves physically moving the ship			1
' he said another challenge is directing @entity37 navy @entity25 aircraft which drop sound - locating buoys , each dangling a hydrophone listening device about 1,000 feet below the surface , into the water			2
with its fuel and food supplies , the ship has the capacity to travel half way around the world in a single journey @entity166 said he and his crew are conscious of the importance of their task and need to refine the search area while the black box 's signal can still be detected			1
' at this stage it 's a challenge trying to refine this position so that when they put a submersible into the water they will be in a position where they can identify what is on the seabed correctly			0
' we have got to give them the best advantage we can and within that they will get to the position where they have the best refined position that they can search			0
' in anything like this i am very conscious , i have 20 years experience of trying to find things on the seabed , it 's pretty much my day job			0
the ship is designed for long stays at sea , and could potentially continue its search for up to 60 days ' i have a brilliant team , young , bright and enthusiastic and we are working 24/7 to cover the sea bed and observe on the surface			1
' there 's a sense that we are playing an important part in this role and we are keen to get it right			0
' in terms of purpose , it 's key to make sure that we detect anything that can help in the investigation			0
' before arriving in the latest search area @entity12 had already searched 6,000 square miles of ocean - an area 10 times the size of @entity221 - 1,000 miles north - west of @entity222 with @entity224 vessels after sensors picked up a possible signal earlier this month			2
also aiding @entity37 vessel @entity69 in the search effort is the @entity229 nuclear submarine @entity230 the was gathering data on her way from @entity234 to the @entity235 when she was diverted to join the international search for the @entity16 plane			1
apart from a 12 - hour stop in the @entity240 to take on supplies and change some of her crew , the survey ship has now been at sea continuously for six weeks			1
@entity166 said : ' we are a ship that 's designed and built to operate for long periods at sea			2
' we can carry provisions for 60 days at sea , and fuel to go pretty much halfway round the world ' he added that the ship would carry on helping with the search , providing as much support as it could to @entity69 , with help from @entity229 nuclear submarine @entity230 , until its tasking is reviewed later in the month .			1

the survey ship was called off regular duty to help aid the search
comes equipped with different probes and buoys to narrow search field
is aided by nuclear submarine @entity230
both will help the deep - sea search for @entity19 's black box
