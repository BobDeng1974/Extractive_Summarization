a 23 - year - old man has spoken of his horror at needing a new bladder at just 17 after snorting ketamine			1
@entity4 , from @entity5 , began using drugs when he was just 12 years old and his cannabis use quickly spiralled to hard drug abuse			1
he began taking ketamine at 16 and within just a year , he had taken so much that he had caused irreversible damage to his body			1
old before his time : @entity4 needed a new bladder at just 17 after snorting ketamine excessively			1
he began using drugs when he was 12 , his cannabis use quickly spiralling to hard drugs			2
he began taking ketamine at 16 and within just a year , he had taken so much that he had caused irreversible damage to his body @entity18 is known for shrinking and scarring the bladder - and @entity4 ' had shrunk to the size normally seen in a pensioner			1
at just 17 , he needed to have his bladder removed and a new one made from his bowel - or face a life of incontinence			1
@entity4 is one of several young people featured in a @entity28 documentary airing tonight			1
called @entity30 , presenter @entity29 follows people who have ailments typically seen in pensioners because of drug abuse			2
although he has a new bladder , he is by no means free of health problems every two weeks he must insert a catheter - a thin , flexible tube - into his belly button and syringe out mucus sitting in his bladder			0
@entity4 went to see a specialist who gave him shocking news - his bladder had shrunk to a fraction of its normal size - and was smaller than a pensioner 's			1
a normal bladder can hold up to 500ml - but @entity4 ' could hold just 5ml viewers see the stomach - turning moment where the mucus fills the syringe attached to the tube in his stomach – a far cry from the hard core raver he once was just a few years ago			1
ketamine use in the @entity57 has doubled since 2006 – around the time @entity4 began taking it			1
in the documentary , he explains : ‘ i started taking drugs when i was 12 – starting with cannabis and gradually working up to heavier things			2
‘ when i started taking k i took a gram a night , but before long , as i was taking 10 - 15g a night – i had a wicked time			1
’ but within months , his body began to object violently to his drug abuse			0
at just 17 , he needed to have his bladder removed and a new one made from his bowel - or face a life of incontinence although he has a new bowel , he is by no means free of health problems			1
every two weeks he has to insert a catheter ( a thin , flexible tube ) into his belly button and syringe out mucus sitting in his bladder ‘ i was at a party , tried to go to the loo and it was really painful			0
then a big lump of goo came out – blood , mess … it as horrible			0

a normal bladder can hold up to 500ml – but @entity4 ' could hold just 5ml			0
normally , the bladder wall expands when filled with urine and contracts when emptied			0
but extreme ketamine use can cause stiffness and scarring in the bladder walls which means it can only expand to a tenth of its normal size			0
while the bowel material can act as a bladder , it is probe to collecting mucus that must be washed out viewers see the stomach - turning moment where the mucus fills the syringe attached to the tube in his stomach - a far cry from the hard core raver he once was just a few years ago to avoid a lifetime of incontinence , @entity4 had two options			1
he could have a bag attached to his hip – or have his bladder removed totally and a new one made from his bowel – surgery typical in someone 60 or 70 years of age			2
he went for the latter – but must now syringe mucus out of his bladder for every two weeks of his life			0
his days of playing rugby are over and he is at risk of dangerous kidney infections			0
his new bladder wo n’t forever , either – he will need it replacing again in 20 - 30 years			0
but ketamine does n’t just cause physical problems such as @entity4 ' – it can severely affect the brain , too			2
the documentary also follows 29 - year - old @entity134 , who has been using ketamine for eight years			2
he has noticed a disturbing deterioration in his memory – to the point where he can walk into a room 10 times and not remember why he is there			0

these receptors are hugely concentrated in the areas critical for memory – the hippocampus – and people who take a lot of the drug can have memory problems as bad as the early stages of dementia			0
like @entity4 , @entity134 began taking ketamine at raves – but he soon became addicted			1
in memory tests conducted during the documentary , @entity134 struggles with basic recall tasks such as naming words that begin with the letter @entity167 – or thinking of different types of fruit			0
professor @entity170 explains that ketamine users often have problems recalling names , words and conversations – all common signs of dementia in old people not someone in their twenties			0
@entity134 vows to stop taking the drug – claiming he is now only using it once a month			0
if he does n’t , the tests show his memory will only get worse and worse .			0
