by @entity0 @entity1 is a man with a plan			2
a member of @entity8 's reclusive @entity7 community , mr @entity4 is helping pioneer one of the group 's most controversial technologies : time travel			1
' we go in the past very , very long ago , very , very far away , because if you go very close to your present , you change a lot of events in your present , ' he explains of his inter-dimensional travels			2
' this is very dangerous for your present			0
' this is not the first time the @entity23 have claimed to have cracked the secret of time travel - they first did so in 1997 but , thanks to the controversy that ensued , have remained silent ever since			1
spiritual : the @entity7 eco community of @entity30 claims to have created a working time machine now the reclusive group , which is based in a series of small communities in @entity30 in @entity8 , has agreed to reveal more about their much - disputed technology in a new documentary			1
' it ’s like a machine but it ’s not only machine , it ’s not only physical			1
. there are energies inside , ' adds mr @entity4 of his time machine			1
' you have only a present , so in the past , you have the body , while here , all that is left behind is mass. ' but time travel is n't the only unusual ( and as yet unproven ) technology that the @entity23 have to offer			2
founded in 1975 by @entity53 , the @entity54 , as it 's officially known , combines neo-pagan beliefs with a passion for nature - both of which inform their activities			0
unusual : @entity62 ( left ) appears on new documentary , outsiders with @entity65 feat : this might look like an ordinary @entity69 home but beneath it is an extraordinary rock cut temple eco-friendly : according to @entity73 , the temples are dedicated to the earth and biodiversity beneath the @entity77 ' countryside complex is a network of rock - cut temples , built by hand in the 70s , and completely unknown to the @entity8 government until 1992			1
' they are dedicated to the planet and the biodiversity , ' explains @entity73 , a member of the @entity87 ' @entity30 community			1
the most famous of the temples , which sit 72m below the ground , is the blue temple , which was built by had using picks and shovels and contains a mystical blue sphere			2
' this blue sphere we use to take inspiration , ' adds @entity73			0
' but mainly for finding the answers that we think we have inside ourselves			0
' the religious aspect of @entity7 life combined with lurid claims about time travel and the community 's insistence that new members take the name of a plant or animal when they join has led to accusations that instead of a community , the @entity7 leaders are running a cult			1
@entity73 , who has lived in the community for more than three decades , is less than impressed			2
' no absolutely not , ' she exclaims			0
' you know a cult is a very closed place but here are a lot of people coming and going - we have many visitors			0
' @entity121 was born to bring together the dreams of many people			0
' despite her protests , there 's no denying that some elements of @entity7 life verge on the bizarre , not least their penchant for playing music with plants			1
one of the @entity7 's many fields of experimental research , the plant - based jam sessions , take place in treehouses and use detectors to channel the plant 's ' music '			1
founder : @entity53 , an @entity8 philosopher who died last year , founded the @entity121 in 1975 structure : @entity144 ( @entity145 ) , left , is minister of foreign affairs , while the outdoor temple is used for rituals ' this is the music of the plants , ' says @entity150 , a friend of @entity73 who chose to be named after the @entity152 monkey			1
' explaining how the @entity155 play the music of the plants , she says : ' there is one detector on the leaf and there ’s another detector which is close to the roots			1
it measures the electric conductivity of the plant			0
' this digital data is then fed into a converter which assigns notes to each plant 's electrical impulses which than then be played out loud			0
' so it ’s the human being that gives the sound to the plant , ' adds @entity150 , ' but it ’s the plant that chooses the notes			0
' they like certain kinds of music and they do n’t like other kinds of music so much			2
if they do n't like something , they will stop playing			0
' @entity73 , @entity184 and @entity1 appear on outsiders with @entity65 , friday night at 10pm on @entity186			0
