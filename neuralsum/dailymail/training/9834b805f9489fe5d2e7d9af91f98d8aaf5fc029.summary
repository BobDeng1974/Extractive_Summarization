she 's one of @entity2 's most cherished stars of screen and stage and has kept fans entertained for nearly 60 years			1
but , as her latest interview proves , @entity6 still looks - and feels - young at heart			1
gracing the cover of @entity11 in a stylish powder blue coat , the 80 - year - old discusses red carpet fashion , whether she ’ll ever remarry and how she feels the temptation to get a tattoo			1
fast forward nearly 60 years and she has added ten @entity22 , six @entity23 , two @entity24 , two @entity25 , an @entity26 , and a @entity27 to her awards cabinet			1
she 's also become a poster girl for the mature female actress and her red carpet choices are respected worldwide ( even if she admits she ' loathes ' getting ready and is always ' terribly nervous ' in clothes ' you have to live up to ' )			2
despite her success and worldwide acclaim , you 'd be wrong for thinking that the grand dame of acting , whose roles have included @entity40 , @entity41 , will consider retiring anytime soon though			1
in the interview , she discusses cosmetic work and while she admits she 'd love to go into surgery right now and come back with completely smooth skin , she 's far too squeamish in october , she began filming as @entity46 , @entity47 to @entity49 's @entity48 in the second series of @entity51			1
' the thought of putting my feet up does n’t appeal at all – no no , no ! , ' she said			2
' i ’ve got plenty of time for that at weekends or on odd days off			2
the prospect of no work on the horizon makes me a bit edgy			2
i have no particular ambitions – i just want to be employed ! ' feisty and independent as ever , @entity6 recently insisted she is driven mad by people constantly asking if she 's ready to slow down - and turning 80 in december was no different			1
' all i wanted was the people i love around me , i did n’t want a fuss			1
the words old , eight - oh and retire are banned in my house , ' she said of the milestone celebration			2
the fun - loving @entity68 actress admits that she was even tempted to get a tattoo to mark her 80th birthday @entity71 to prove her point , the fun - loving @entity68 actress admits that she was even tempted to get an inking to mark the occasion			2
she said : ' i am tempted to have a tattoo to mark my birthday			0
@entity78 ’s [ her daughter ] very keen on me having one			0
there ’s an @entity82 symbol that i like which supposedly represents life and love and everything			1
' one of the cameramen who worked on @entity88 told me what it meant , but i ’m a bit nervous in case i ’m being set up … it might be unbelievably rude ! ' as well as tattoos , she also discusses cosmetic work and while she admits she 'd love to go into surgery right now and come back with completely smooth skin , she 's far too squeamish			1
she said : ' i do n’t think i ’m vain enough			0
it ’s not that i do n’t mind the lines , because i do , but just not enough to do anything			0
my agent would go barmy			0
i ’d do myself out of the parts for old people			0

she said : ' for 30 years , i was divinely happy with @entity115			1
i love the company of being in a relationship - i ’m no good on my own			2
' it ’s lovely to have someone to laugh with again : @entity110 has a heavenly sense of humour			0
' he laughs at exactly the same things as i do			0
' @entity126 is the most important thing			0
if someone can make you laugh , even in the middle of the most terrible time , it ’s wonderful			0
' discussing the prospect of remarrying , she added : ' marriage is n’t something i ’ve thought about			0
' @entity110 has his house , i have mine a few miles away , and that suits us			0
