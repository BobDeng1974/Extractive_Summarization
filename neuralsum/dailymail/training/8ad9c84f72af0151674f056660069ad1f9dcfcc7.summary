chemists subjected spheres of dna to extreme temperatures and found the material - and the data stored on it - could be successfully decoded just one gram of @entity2 can store the equivalent of 14,000 blu - ray discs			1
but although the potential for @entity2 as an alternative to hard drives has been known about for years , it is not the most reliable and secure way to keep data safe			1
the latest breakthrough could be about to change that , however			0
chemists subjected spheres of dna to extreme temperatures designed to mimic chemical degradation and found the material - and the data stored on it - could be successfully decoded			1
the research was led by @entity22 from @entity24 's @entity23 and @entity25			0
' dna lends itself to this task as it can store large amounts of information in a compact manner , ' said the researchers			2
' unfortunately , the data is not always retrievable error - free : gaps and false information in the encoded data arise through chemical degradation and mistakes in dna sequencing			1
' [ we ] have revealed how the long - term , error - free storage of information can be achieved , potentially for more than a million years			1
' in 2013 , researchers demonstrated that data could be saved and read from dna , but during tests the time between ' writing ' the information and reading , or sequencing it , was relatively short			1
even during this short time , mistakes were spotted in the writing and reading of the data stored on the dna			2
over a longer term , @entity2 can change significantly as it reacts chemically with the environment , and this is the biggest obstacle to using dna as a long - term storage option			1
with this in mind , professor @entity22 took inspiration from fossilised bones			0
despite being thousands of years old , it is possible to obtain genetic material found within the bones			0
he concluded that this dna is protected because it is ' encapsulated and protected '			0
with this in mind he devised a way to protect the information - bearing dna with a synthetic ' fossil shell ' , in the same way			1
his team began by encoding @entity72 's @entity71 and the methods of @entity74 by @entity75 in the dna			0
the researchers then placed the dna segments into spheres of silica with a diameter of roughly 150 nanometres			1
for the recent breakthrough , the researchers took inspiration from fossilised bones ( stock image )			0
despite being thousands of years old , it is possible to obtain genetic material because the dna is protected inside the bones			1
the experts designed a similar ' fossil shell ' to protect the information - bearing dna in the same way in order to simulate the degradation of @entity2 over a long period of time , researchers stored it at a temperature of between 60 ° @entity98 ) and 70 ° @entity99 ) for up to a month			1
these high temperatures replicate the chemical degradation that takes place over hundreds of years within just a few weeks			1
by doing this , the researchers could compare the storage of @entity2 in silica glass with other common storage methods such as on impregnated filter paper and in a biopolymer			1
the dna encapsulated in the glass shell turned out to be particularly robust and the researchers were able separate it from the shell , using a fluoride solution , and read information from it			1
in 2013 , researchers from the @entity119 at the @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity122 ' downloaded ' all 154 of @entity124 's sonnets on to strands of synthetic dna			2
in 2013 , researchers from @entity122 ' downloaded ' all 154 of @entity124 's sonnets on to strands of synthetic @entity2 ( illustrated ) scientists were then able to decode the information and reproduce the words of the @entity124 with complete accuracy			1
the same technique made it possible to store a 26 - second excerpt from @entity138 's ' @entity137 ' speech and a photo of the @entity122 laboratory where the work took place			0
for their experiment , the scientists used a tiny amount of synthetic , dry dna			0
five genetic ' letters ' from the genetic code - a , @entity98 , @entity148 and @entity149 - were used to represent the zeros and ones that make up ' bytes ' of digital information			0
for instance , the upper case t in the word ' @entity154 ' from the second line of @entity124 's @entity158 - ' thou art more lovely and more temperate ' - was encoded by the sequence @entity160			2
the scientists then incorporated an ' error correction ' , similar to that found laptops and mobile phones			0
this involved overlapping short strands of dna and independently writing every million - molecule fragment of code four times			2
effectively , three back ups were created for each fragment , greatly reducing the chances of mistakes			0
this was a similar method used by @entity176 from @entity24 's @entity177 for the recent study			0
and , because the silica spheres are comparable to the way @entity2 is protected in fossilised bones , the researchers concluded that if stored at certain temperatures , the data could survive for millions of years			1
the team used the example of extremely low temperatures , such as -18 ° @entity188 by comparison , data on microfilm can be preserved only for an estimated 500 years			1
scientists used an ' error correction ' similar to those found in laptops ( stock image )			0
this involved adding data to each fragment to create back ups as the researchers pointed out , this is not the first time @entity2 has been used to store information and digital data			1
in 2013 , researchers from the @entity119 ( @entity119 ) at the @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity122 ' downloaded ' all 154 of @entity124 's sonnets on to strands of synthetic dna			2
scientists were then able to decode the information and reproduce the words of the @entity124 with complete accuracy			0
dr @entity213 , from the @entity119 said : ' we already know that @entity2 is a robust way to store information because we can extract it from bones of woolly mammoths , which date back tens of thousands of years , and make sense of it			1

this was a similar method used by @entity176 from @entity24 's @entity177 for the recent study			0
the researchers from @entity119 stressed that the dna used was wholly artificial and different to the genetic molecules of life , and if it was added to a human body , it would degrade and be disposed of			2
theoretically , 100 million hours of high definition video could be stored in a cupful of dna - equivalent to every film and tv show ever created			2
a dna archive also requires no constant supply of electric power like hard drives and data centres ( example pictured ) do currently the technology is restricted by the length of time it takes to sequence dna and its high cost - around £ 8,000 ( $ 12,300 ) per megabyte of stored material			2
even so , dna - based storage could today be cost effective for archives of several megabytes over long time periods of 600 to 5,000 years , computer models predict			1

a @entity2 archive also requires no constant supply of electric power like hard discs do .			0

potential for dna to be used for data storage has been *discussed* for years
but retrieving the data encoded in the genes has *previously* proved tricky
inspired by fossils , researchers from @entity273 encased @entity2 in a ' fossil shell '
they subjected these shells - or silica spheres - to extreme temperatures
this was carried out to mimic chemical degradation seen naturally on dna
despite the conditions , the dna was extracted and decoded from the silica
and if preserved in *freezing* temperatures , the researchers said the data has the potential to last for ' millions of years ' inside dna
