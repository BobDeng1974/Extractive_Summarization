@entity0 , a 25 - year - old rapist , emerged from the gates of @entity2 two hours before dawn			1
he climbed into a silver @entity5 4x4 and raced away through the slumbering @entity7 streets			2
and with his release , @entity9 professional football was confronted by the kind of crisis which will test both its basic competence and its moral authority			1
now most football ‘ crises ’ are little more than frivolous fodder for the back pages : this young footballer complains of feeling ‘ tired ’ , that team loses three games in a row , this insufferable manager announces that referees are in malevolent conspiracy against him			1
tales full of sound and fury , signifying nothing			2
but this one is different			2
this one will ask important questions of a kind that the sport may struggle to answer			2
in 2011 , @entity0 , a footballer with @entity34 , raped an inebriated 19 - year - old woman in a hotel room in @entity40			1
he was tried , convicted and sentenced to five years ’ imprison - ment			1
he was refused leave to appeal			2
in the words of the lord chief justice lord judge : ‘ we can see no possible basis which would justify us interfering with the verdict of the jury , which heard all the evidence and reflected on it after careful summing up by the judge ’			2
shortly after the trial , the victim ’s identity was revealed by the trolls of social media			2
as a result of the subsequent abuse , she was forced to adopt a new identity and leave her home town			0
a 4x4 carrying convicted rapist @entity0 leaves @entity2 in @entity7 at 5am on friday the @entity60 footballer , who last played for @entity34 , has served half his five - year sentence for rape @entity0 was released on friday , halfway through his sentence and a storm came crashing around his head			1
almost 150,000 people had signed a petition , appealing to the @entity34 chairman @entity68 not to reinstate him as a player			1
to accede to the appeal would require strong nerve and firm principle , since they once paid £ 3million for @entity0 ’ services			1
@entity75 , chief executive of the @entity74 , argued that @entity0 has served his sentence and should therefore be allowed to return to his work			1
the temperature was significantly raised by @entity78 , a daytime television performer , who prattled : ‘ he did n’t cause any bodily harm to the person ... and she had far too much to drink			0
it was reprehensible , but he has served his time			1
’ she later apologised for her dimly offensive outburst but not before she had been swatted by @entity85 , the @entity87 police and crime commissioner , who said : ‘ he raped her — that is a serious injury			0
if you get drunk and someone steals your wallet , does this mean it ’s any less of a theft than if you were sober ? ’ such is the story so far and football ’s dilemma is taking shape			1
there are powerful arguments on both sides			0
should @entity34 , who were apparently paying @entity0 at the rate of £ 20,000 a week for the first part of his sentence , cut their ties and send him packing ? or should they opt for mercy and redemption and restore him to a team for whom he has scored 48 goals in 113 matches ? in truth , we would have more confidence in a reasoned , equitable conclusion if the game ’s record in these matters were not so dubious			1
recall , for instance , that sleazy furore of last may , when @entity125 — chief executive of the @entity126 and therefore the most powerful man in the sport — was shown to have sent a series of crude , sexist emails			0
you will recall his mocking of ‘ female irrationality ’ , the juvenile smut of his story of a former girlfriend , whom he called ‘ double decker ’ , for reasons which he leeringly explained			0
there was also his tasteful re-telling of a ‘ male fairy - tale ’ about a prince who was proposed to , said no , then lived happily ever after and ‘ banged skinny big - titted broads ’			2
the @entity126 launched a rigorous inquiry , conducted by one of @entity125 ’s bosom chums , then declared that their leader , who keeps their money rolling in , was not remotely sexist			0
his subsequent apology took some time			0
the first self - justifying diatribe contained not a smidgeon of sincerity , while the second was almost as weak			2
move on , nothing to see here			2
@entity126 chief executive @entity125 at a game between @entity162 and @entity163 in may then , just last week , the garrulous @entity164 was charged with misconduct by the @entity166 after responding to a @entity168 follower who taunted that @entity169 needed a decent centre - half			1
‘ get ya mum in ’ , said @entity164			0
‘ plays the field well son ! # sket ’			0
a dictionary search revealed that “ sket ” is a @entity176 term for a whore			0
some might wonder about the sinister mind that comes up with such a slur			0
i doubt that @entity164 is much given to introspection			0
this , then , is the climate in which @entity34 must make their decision : brash , jokey , heavy on blokeish ‘ banter ’ , devoid of saving sensitivity			1
overt racism is thankfully unacceptable , but sexism , the ‘ she - must - have - asked - for - it ’ culture , is alive and well and thriving unchecked in @entity9 football			1
@entity164 was charged with misconduct after responding to a @entity168 follower @entity34 must decide whether they are to allow @entity0 ( pictured in action in 2012 ) back i have no idea how @entity68 and his board will decide the @entity0 issue			1
i hope they will not be swayed by that petition , since such talent - show tactics are not the way important questions should be settled			1
equally , i hope that the earnest but ill - judged efforts of the player ’s friends will not prove decisive			1
in any event , we should not envy @entity68 ’s predicament			1
somebody observed this week that football is the victim in all this			2
for the victim is a 19 - year - old woman who had taken too much to drink			1
and found herself in the wrong place , at the wrong time , with the wrong person			0
@entity219 in a week dominated by the release of @entity0 and football ’s disturbing views on violence towards women , one voice was strangely silent			1
@entity226 , who is rumoured to be @entity227 , might have been expected to lead this particular debate			0
and yet she had nothing to say			0
minister of sport @entity226 ( right ) with @entity126 chief executive @entity125 in 2013 the sport ministry , devoid of funds , influence and power is scorned by ambitious politicians			0
but even its most inept occupants have , on occasion , found the nerve to make a point and state a case			2
she just keeps her head down and waits for the moment to pass			0
it is surely time she was put out of her misery			0
be sure she would go quietly			0
@entity162 owner @entity251 city fulfil their eastern promise the footballers of @entity162 have moved into a new home			1
to nobody ’s surprise , it is almost unimaginably lavish : the @entity259 has 16 pitches , an artificial pitch , a 7,000 - seater stadium , as well as a training and medical block and a sixth - form college			1
the wider development , also backed by the owners of the club , involves a £ 1billion boost in 6,000 homes and shops in a neglected part of the city			0
no club has ever known such resources , but then , none has enjoyed the energetic backing of @entity251 and his colleagues			0
there are those who suggest that such largesse is deceptive , that it is part of a plan to make the @entity251 ’s of @entity283 more acceptable to the wider world			0
and , given @entity283 ’s human rights record , they may have a point			0
but the fact is that they are making a difference to the wider community as well as their fortuitously chosen football club			2
no other owner has made a remotely comparable impact upon his local area ; not abramovich at @entity296 , nor the @entity297 at @entity34 , and certainly not that popular fellow who owns @entity299			1
there are many reasons to regret the influx of foreign owners into the @entity126			0
but the massively improved condition of @entity305 is not among them			0
@entity162 have built a new £ 200million training complex , which includes 16 pitches @entity162 have hailed their new training base as one of the best sporting facilities in the world @entity162 captain @entity313 has a look around the team 's new training base			1

@entity0 released from prison after raping 19 - year - old girl in 2012
@entity60 footballer served half of his five - year sentence
@entity34 and football left with dilemma whether to allow @entity0 back
almost 150,000 people have signed petition to @entity34 chairman @entity68 not to reinstate @entity0 as a player
@entity162 move into new state - of - the - art training base , which boasts 16 pitches , an artificial pitch , 7,000 - seat stadium and and sixth - form college
