by @entity0 one of the biggest criticisms of @entity3 's plastic devices is they do n’t have the high - class , luxury design of the aluminium @entity7			1
and future models of @entity10 devices may take this luxury a step further by being entirely encased in glass			1
the latest @entity10 patent describes a method of creating glass gadgets by fusing large panes together before filing them into shape			1
the patent was filed by the @entity21 firm in january 2012 and awarded yesterday			1
it describes a method of creating gadgets made of glass by fusing large panes together ( pictured ) before filing into shape			1
according to the files , future versions of @entity10 's devices - including @entity30 , @entity31 , ipods as - could be made more durable earlier this month , @entity10 was awarded a patent that revealed plans to add customisable security options			1
if implemented , these could , based on a user 's location , automatically unlock a phone when the user is in a ' safe ' zone			0
for example , if the device is connected to the user ’s home @entity43			0
alternatively , if the phone is on a mobile or public network , security levels could be increased			0
this could add extra security measures and steps , in addition to the pin , passcode of fingerprint scanner			0
the patent was filed by the @entity21 firm , including senior vice president of design sir @entity60 , in january 2012 , but was n't awarded until yesterday			1
according to the files , titled ‘ fused glass device housings ’ , future versions of @entity10 ’s electronic devices - including iphones , @entity31 , @entity32 as well as @entity66 - could be made more durable and shatterproof			1
but , because glass is heavy , the patent describes a system that would fuse panes of glass together , which would then be secured using a chemical strengthening tool			2
the panes would be larger than the finished model and filed and polished into shape - supposedly to make sure the edges fuse together without fracturing , and without a visible seam			2
weak points in the glass would be strengthened using raised glass features and ribs			1
spaces for buttons and ports would then be carved into the glass			0
@entity10 's @entity86 ( pictured left and right ) has an aluminium body and glass panels at the top and bottom of the rear			1
the @entity93 ( centre ) is plastic one of the hand - drawn images also revealed this glass could be filed into a curved design , ( pictured )			2
the patent explained any glass casings could additionally be tinted to hide internal components weak points in the glass would be strengthened using raised glass features and ribs			1
spaces for buttons , ports , and any future versions of @entity10 ’s fingerprints scanner would then be carved out of the glass			2
glass casings would set @entity10 devices further apart from its rival @entity3 's			2
the @entity111 is pictured one of the hand - drawn images revealed that this glass could be filed into a curved design , while the glass could additionally be tinted to hide the internal components			0
@entity10 ’s @entity86 currently has an aluminium body and glass panels at the top and bottom of the rear			1
‘ electronic devices such as cellular telephones , handheld computers , and portable music players often include housings with glass members , ’ explained the patent			2
‘ for example , a device with a display may have a glass cover that serves as a protective layer			0
in some devices , a rear housing surface may be formed from a layer of glass			0
‘ to ensure satisfactory robustness , it is generally desirable to form device housing structures such as cover glass layers and housing surfaces from structures that are sufficiently strong to prevent damage during accidental impact events			0
‘ @entity148 strength and device aesthetics can sometimes be enhanced by using sufficiently thick glass layers			0
‘ however , the size and weight of a device should not be excessive			0
it would therefore be desirable to be able to provide improved glass structures for electronic devices			0

the patent was filed by @entity10 in january 2012 and awarded yesterday
it describes a method of creating gadgets made entirely of glass
this involves fusing large panes of glass together before filing into shape
glass devices could then be strengthened using raised glass features
the current @entity7 is made of aluminium with glass panels
