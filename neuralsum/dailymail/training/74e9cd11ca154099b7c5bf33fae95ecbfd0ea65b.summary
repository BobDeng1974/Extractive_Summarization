the child has been at the centre of a global interpol investigation since she was found during a police raid on the @entity24 gipsy settlement near @entity25 , central @entity13 , earlier this month			1

meanwhile , @entity4 ’s birth mother , @entity3 , 35 , remains in @entity18 , where police are investigating claims that she sold her daughter			1
