by @entity0 @entity1 was delighted to receive a beautiful bouquet on @entity3			1
but her joy turned to horror when the flowers poisoned and killed three of her beloved cats			1
miss @entity1 did not know that ingesting any part of a lily can be fatal to felines , with even a small amount of pollen enough to kill them			1
@entity17 , 14 and her mother @entity1 , 40 , @entity18 , @entity19 who received a huge bouquet of flowers on @entity3 which contained lilies whose pollen poisoned three of their cats despite being rushed to the vet as soon as they showed signs of discomfort , the cats – @entity30 , one , @entity31 , five , and miss @entity1 ’s companion of 17 years , @entity32 – could not be saved			1
miss @entity1 said : ‘ @entity30 was the first to die			1
then @entity32 went in my arms as i discussed euthanasia options with the vet			1
‘ @entity31 survived a little longer but she ’s now buried in the garden along with the boys			1
i loved them all so much , they were my babies			2
’ a fourth cat , @entity40 , aged three , survived but there are fears that it has suffered permanent kidney damage			2
although harmless to most animals , lilies are highly poisonous to cats			2
even if they do not deliberately eat the flowers , the animals can brush against them and later , when they wash , ingest tiny particles of pollen which have fallen on to their fur			2
yesterday miss @entity1 , 40 , described the shocking sequence of events after the bouquet of lilies , roses and carnations was delivered to her home in @entity18 , @entity19			1
the mother of one , who works as a gardener , said : ‘ the flowers were a lovely @entity66 ’s surprise from an ex-partner			0
‘ i put them in a vase on the windowsill			2
i had absolutely no idea they could harm my babies			0
‘ i realised something was going horribly wrong when they suddenly went off their food			0
@entity1 's cats @entity32 ( left ) and @entity30 ( right ) who were poisoned by the pollen in a bouquet of flowers @entity1 's cat @entity40 who survived being poisoned by the pollen @entity84 , 14 , holding a kitten ( left ) and her surviving cat @entity40 ( right ) ‘ the next morning i found @entity30 collapsed behind the sofa			1
i took him to the vet but ten minutes later my friend came rushing in carrying @entity32			1
@entity91 warn several types of lilies have been found to be deadly to cats , including @entity95 , tiger lily , rubrum lily , @entity99 show lily , some species of day lily , and certain other members of the @entity104 family			1
ingesting just one leaf can result in severe poisoning , and within a very short time your cat will exhibit signs of toxicity			0
all parts of the lily plant are considered toxic to cats , and consuming even small amounts can cause severe poisoning			1
kittens are particularly prone to being poisoned as they explore their environment , and older cats are often affected simply because they brush against the flower and get pollen on their coats			1
later they groom the pollen off , and of course ingest the lily pollen as they clean their fur			1
the primary toxic effects are on the kidneys			0
within minutes to hours of ingesting part of the lily plant , your cat may vomit , become lethargic , or develop a lack of appetite			2
as the toxin begins to affect the kidneys , these signs continue and worsen as the kidney damage progresses			0
without prompt and proper treatment by a veterinarian , the cat may develop kidney failure in approximately 36 to 72 hours			0
‘ they looked terrible , they were trembling and crying out			0
it broke my heart to see them in pain like that			0
i had no idea what was happening			0
’ experts warn that many common lilies sold in @entity154 , including the @entity95 , tiger lily , rubrum lily and @entity99 lily , can cause kidney failure and sudden death if a cat ingests any part of the plant or its pollen			1
animals taken to the vet within six hours can recover but their chances of survival diminish rapidly after that			0
‘ i could n’t believe it when the vet told me what had killed them , ’ said miss @entity1			1
‘ i ca n’t believe that the risks of lilies have been well - established in other countries but we hardly hear about it here			0
thousands upon thousands of lilies will go on sale this weekend for @entity180 and i ’m petrified that it ’s going to happen to someone else			0
’ she and her daughter @entity183 , 14 , have been visiting florists , shops and supermarkets and asking staff to put up warning signs in time for @entity180			2
miss @entity1 also has four kittens , but fortunately they appear to have avoided contact with the flowers			1
the @entity192 urged animal lovers to consult its website for a full list of everyday items that can harm pets			0
a spokesman said : ‘ many people take it for granted that what is safe for them is safe for their pets			0
‘ we would urge everyone to check the sort of items that could cause a hazard because we would hate to think of anyone else having to go through what this poor woman has had to endure			0
’ @entity210 of the @entity211 said : ‘ pet owners need to be aware of this and other risks			0
‘ flowers are sold at a wide range of outlets but our members recognise how important this issue is			0
‘ generally , they include a warning on the label of flower products saying that lilies are harmful to cats if eaten			2

@entity1 , 40 , was *unaware* lily pollen can blind , *paralyse* or kill cats
she received a bouquet from an ex partner and put it on window sill
within days @entity30 , one , @entity31 , five and her beloved @entity32 , 17 , died
