@entity1 mp @entity0 insisted spending £ 10,000 a time on portraits of politicians was ' chicken feed ' the huge bill for taxpayer - funded portraits of politicians has been dismissed as ' chicken feed ' by a wealthy @entity1 mp			1
@entity0 , a member of the committee which commissions paintings , photographs and sculptures of @entity13 and peers , said the average £ 10,000 for each artwork was just a fraction of the overall cost of running @entity18			1
he claimed many politicians are too ' shy and retiring ' to sit for a portrait , but after a backlash against the £ 250,000 cost of portraits of the likes of @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , he admitted ' some are better than others '			1
the spending spree since 1995 included £ 11,750 for an apparently topless painting of @entity32 ’s @entity27 – the same amount as was spent on a full - sized statue of @entity35			1
other works include an £ 11,750 portrait of former foreign secretary @entity38 , a £ 10,000 portrait of @entity41 @entity40 , an £ 8,000 painting of @entity43 and a £ 4,000 oil painting of foreign secretary @entity45			1
@entity32 left - wingers @entity46 and @entity48 had portraits commissioned which cost £ 2,000 and £ 2,180 respectively			1
the bill for the artworks of two dozen politicians has been racked up since 1995 and approved by the speakers ’ @entity50 on @entity55 today mr @entity0 , a former investment banker , sparked outrage as he defended the spending			1
' i ’m all for saving money , saving money right , left and centre , but this is chicken feed , ' he told @entity64 's today programme			0
' it ’s about £ 10,000 a year on administrative costs of the @entity67 of £ 200m			1
it hardly even ranks as chicken feed			0
' but @entity32 mp @entity70 hit back : ' he must have some very well fed chickens ! ' for a man who has his own personal portrait gallery , i suppose he has a different perspective			0
but to described that as chickenfeed shows someone who is more than a little out - of - touch , ' he told the @entity77			2
the huge sums were signed - off by the little - known committee of mps which each year asks some of the country ’s best portrait paintings to produce work of their colleagues			2
this striking portrait of @entity27 was produced by artist tuart @entity87 in 2004 former @entity1 @entity89 sir @entity88 and @entity32 's @entity25 have both been captured on canvas by @entity18 - paid for by the taxpayer @entity0 is widely regarded as the poshest man in politics			1
he cracks jokes in @entity95 , mixes quotes from @entity98 's @entity97 and children 's tv show @entity99 and once casually dropped the word ‘ floccinaucinihilipilification ’ into a debate on the pay of @entity107 staff			0
the 44 - year - old son of late @entity110 editor lord @entity109 was elected mp for @entity112 in 2010			2
he read the @entity110 at the age of eight , and at 11 turned a £ 50 inheritance into £ 3,5000 on the stock market			2
he once boasted that he would be ‘ a millionaire at 20 , a multi-millionaire at 40 and prime minister at 70 , when i ’ve made enough money to be able to afford to waste some on politics ’			0
he is observed with trashy @entity122 soap @entity120			0
speaking in march last year he said the people he ’d most like to meet are : ‘ @entity35 , the @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 , in that order			0
’ but he is perhaps better known for once campaigning with his nanny in a @entity129 when standing for election in @entity131 in 1997			0
except he denies it was a @entity129 : ' oh , no. that was wrong			0
well , the @entity128 bit is right			0
of course she came canvassing ; she ’s part of the family after all — she ’s been with us 47 years			0
' but we took my mother ’s @entity138			0
i do n’t think a @entity129 ’s a suitable campaigning car			0
as much as anything it was the petrol consumption : six miles to the gallon , ' he said last year			0
but mr @entity0 insisted many senior politicians were reluctant to be the subject of artworks			1
' you may be surprised to know that quite a number of people we think should be painted are very shy and retiring about it			1
' you ’d think politicians would be desperate to be immortalised for history , but actually we ’re a more diffident lot than you might have thought			2
' some of the paintings have been mocked for their quality , including a portrait of mr @entity25 with an over-large head and a striking image of @entity164 which is almost unreconisable			1
mr @entity0 accepted the works vary in quality : ' as with all portrait painting , some are going to be better than others , but some are really very wonderful pieces of work when they are finally produced and will remain in the @entity173 , perhaps , for a thousand years			1
and so it is an important part of our history			0
' he added that the selection of some subjects was ' almost automatic ' including former prime ministers , @entity182 and people ' who are the first to do things ' , including @entity164 , the first black woman elected to @entity18			0
but far from recording only those who reach high office , it has also ordered works featuring left - wing firebrand @entity48 , photographs of @entity187 mp @entity186 and a series of pictures have been taken of the committee themselves			2
the @entity67 insisted it has moved to cut spending on portraits in recent years , but the details reveal the scale of the spending from records dating back to 1995			1
and some @entity13 have recognised the sensitivity of spending money on art at a time of austerity : @entity32 deputy leader @entity207 agreed to sit for a portrait but withdrew in 2012 are questions were asked about the cost			0
three paintings commissioned to mark the 2001 election feature mr @entity25 and his opponents , @entity1 leader @entity45 and @entity215 @entity214			2
the piece cost £ 6,000			0
mr @entity25 later for a separate portrait by @entity218 , which was criticised for showing the @entity220 with an over-large head			2
a painting of work and pensions secretary @entity40 came cost £ 10,000 , £ 8,000 for minister without portfolio @entity43 and £ 4,000 for foreign secretary @entity45			1
the bill for @entity32 's @entity27 ’s striking – apparently topless – portrait came to £ 11 , - the same amount as was spent on a full - sized statue of former prime minister @entity35			1
a painting of long - serving backbencher @entity48 cost £ 2,180 while @entity32 's @entity46 and former @entity215 leader @entity215 both cost £ 2,000 and another of the party 's former leaders , sir @entity233 , cost £ 10,346			1
a life - size statue of @entity35 , which stands in the @entity236 's @entity235 , cost the same as the @entity27 portrait trio : in 2001 the three main party leaders were painted to mark the general election by @entity242 , including ( left to right ) @entity32 's @entity25 , @entity215 @entity214 and @entity1 @entity45 @entity243 : @entity1 former chancellor @entity43 , who is now a minister without portfolio , was painted by @entity244 in 2007 @entity245 , chief executive of the @entity246 , said : ‘ while the public might expect former prime ministers or speakers to be afforded the honour of a painting or bust in @entity18 , it would certainly seem that the net is being cast increasingly wide when it comes to identifying subjects			1
‘ regularly splashing out four or five - figure sums for these portraits has the whiff of an expensive vanity project , for which unwitting taxpayers are footing the bill			2
‘ when photographs are so much cheaper than paintings , politicians need to think twice about spending our money immortalising themselves or their friends on canvas , or even in bronze			2
’ a portrait of commons speaker @entity26 cost £ 22,000 to commission , with an extra £ 15,000 spent on a frame and coat of arms in keeping with other paintings in the speaker 's @entity67			1
former speaker @entity278 has been feature three times , in a £ 1,500 portrait in 1997 , an £ 8,000 portrait in 1999 and a £ 9,000 bronze bust in 2000			1
former commons speaker @entity35 in front of her portrait at the mall galleries ( left ) and with a less formal painting by by artist @entity288 @entity32 left - winger @entity46 was painted by @entity289 , and has been displayed in the @entity290 commons speaker @entity26 spent £ 22,000 on the painting ( left ) and another £ 15,000 on a frame including the creation of a coat of arms ( right ) the costs were revealed by a @entity297 request by the @entity77			1
decisions on commissioning and buying art are made by the speaker 's @entity300 , a cross-party group that is currently chaired by @entity32 's @entity302			0
from 1995 to 2000 just three mps were chosen to be featured in a portrait , at an average cost of £ 3,375			1
but from 2000 - 05 , 11 parliamentarians were honoured at an average of £ 7,180			2
between 2005 and 2010 there 10 commissions at an average of £ 9,300 each			0
a @entity67 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity312 at the @entity67 records those who have made a significant contribution to @entity316 political life over the centuries and in each parliament the speaker 's @entity300 endeavours to update this record by adding to the contemporary portrait collection			0
‘ in recent years the annual budget for acquiring works of art for the collection has been reduced to reflect the need for savings in the current economic downturn			0
this is part of the @entity67 's drive to reduce its overall cost by 17 per cent by 2014 - 15			0

@entity0 defends portraits costing £ 10,000 each
insists many politicians are ' shy and retiring ' about posing for artists
admits that some of the much - mocked portraits are better than others
since 1995 , two dozen politicians have been captured on canvas
@entity25 , @entity88 and @entity346 among those chosen
*ex-commons* speaker @entity278 has been featured 3 times
@entity26 spent £ 22,000 on a painting and another £ 15,000 on a frame
