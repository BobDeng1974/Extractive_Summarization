by @entity1 reporter ex-minister @entity2 says the government 's approach to @entity6 child poverty ' falls far short of what is needed ' the government 's plans to end child poverty are doomed to failure , its adviser on social mobility has warned as new estimates revealed the @entity6 will be home to 3.5 million poor children by 2020			1
a report by the @entity18 , chaired by former health secretary @entity2 , branded the draft strategy for the next three years a ' missed opportunity ' and insisted it fell far short of what is needed to prevent the numbers rising			1
mr @entity2 said it was ' particularly lamentable ' that ministers had been unable to agree on how to measure poverty after rubbishing existing measures			1
' the government 's approach falls far short of what is needed to reduce , yet alone end child poverty in our country , ' added the @entity34 mp			1
' our new research shows that the gap between the objective of making child poverty history and the reality is becoming ever wider			2
' he also called on politicians from all parties to work together to combat the issue , adding : ' willing the ends without the means today merely becomes a broken promise tomorrow			0
' across the political spectrum , party leaders now need to come clean about what they plan to do to hit the targets , or what progress they can deliver if they expect to fall short			0
' in its report , the commission concluded there were some positive things in the strategy , including the extension of childcare support for low - income families and a greater acknowledgement of the problem of working poverty than before			2
but it criticised a lack of any clear measures to assess progress and the absence of a detailed plan covering what needs to happen to jobs , wages and benefits to ensure poverty goes down			2
it also identified limited action to get other parts of society , such as employers , engaged in tackling poverty and a lack of new action on in - work poverty as fundamental problems			0
in addition it accused the government of ignoring the impact of welfare cuts and of continuing to distance itself from statutory measures in the @entity90 2010 , which senior ministers describe as ' discredited ' , without suggesting any alternatives			0
' doomed ' : the report wants that 3.5million children will live in poverty by 2020 - five times the government 's legal obligation to end it the findings were published as new research carried out on behalf of the commission by @entity102 revealed the 2020 child poverty targets will be missed by a large margin			1
it estimated that even overly optimistic assumptions about parental employment rates and earnings would still leave more than three million children - 21 % - in absolute poverty by 2020 - almost five times the number needed to meet the government 's legal obligation to end it			1
to achieve the targets within the current council tax and benefits system , it said , would require “ implausible ” parental employment rates of close to 100 % , combined with big increases in working hours of families in working poverty over and above the requirements of @entity122			0
a spokesman for the @entity124 said : ' we remain committed to our goal of ending child poverty by 2020			2
our strategy outlines plans to tackle the root causes of poverty , including worklessness , low earnings and educational failure			0
' this approach is a better reflection of the reality of child poverty in the @entity6 today and is the only way to achieve lasting change			1
' under this government there are 300,000 fewer children living in relative income poverty and 100,000 fewer children in workless poor families			0
we have just seen the largest rise in employment for over 40 years and unemployment is falling			0
but there is more to do - and we are getting on with that job			0
' the commission 's own research highlights the weaknesses of the current child poverty measures - calculating poverty by income alone fails to address the issues which hold people back and that 's what we 're tackling			1

former minister @entity2 says @entity6 struggling to reduce child poverty
in six years , figure will be five times the government 's legal obligation
government can not even agree on how to define the *phenomenon* , he says
report says current strategy lacks clear measures on how to help children
