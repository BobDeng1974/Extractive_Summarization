@entity2 ’s eco-friendly , e-card featured a photo of her three daughters , together with a biblical quote and a simple @entity8 greeting			1
unfortunately for her - and everyone ’s inbox - a technical glitch meant that even though everyone was bcc ’d , anyone who responded by hitting ' reply all ' sent their message plus e-mail address to @entity2 ’s entire distribution list			1
@entity8 cheer ? @entity2 has three daughters from her marriage to @entity33 gov @entity32 , twins @entity34 and @entity36 , plus @entity37 initial responses to the card were upbeat and full of seasonal cheer and some even bordered on sycophantic as they complimented @entity2 , who is president of the @entity41 , on her beautiful family			1
but tempers soon started to fray as people found themselves inundated with a load of spam emails from other on the list			2
‘ please remove me from mass e-mails to @entity2 in reply to her christmas card , ’ demanded activist @entity49 , reports the @entity53			1
‘ please remove me from your email lists ! ! ! ’ whined another responder , as more than and more people started to lose patience with the endless stream of replies			2
billionaire financier @entity12 , left , and activist @entity49 , right , both demanded to be taken off @entity2 's email list after receiving a bunch of spam replies by friday , one e-mailer could take no more and announced that he was copying @entity67 coo @entity66 to ‘ suspend the group e-mail that led to the inbox clutter '			1
then it all got too much for @entity12 , who replied : ‘ i think something more along the lines of an apology would be in order			0
please be sure i never get an e-mail from this organization again			0
’ but still the heated debate did n’t end and so @entity14 felt duty bound to chime in and defend the person responsible			0
‘ @entity2 did nothing wrong ... she never exposed anybody ’s private e-mails or intended to ... this did not irritate me to get a bunch of e-mails that say happy holidays to @entity2 , ’ he protested			0
next up @entity13 weighed in with , ‘ be more upset with the @entity88 than @entity67			0
’ finally , a mortified @entity2 braved the ire of her so - called friends by offering her ‘ profuse apologies			2
’ ‘ you may be happy to know that my @entity94 ’s resolution is to not bother all my friends during the holidays , ’ she promised			0
former @entity15 political adviser @entity14 , left , and actress @entity13 , right , stood up for @entity2 as the angry emails started to fly @entity2 is president of the @entity41 in @entity99			0

@entity2 sent her friends a card featuring a photo of her and her daughters
unfortunately a technical glitch meant everyone on her list received replies that were supposed to be sent to just her
an email *war* *ensued* after a number of her ' friends ' lost patience with receiving so much spam and demanded to be taken off the list
several people then *attempted* to stand up for @entity2 before she sent another email to apologize for starting the whole mess
