by @entity0 published : 04:40 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 07:30 est , 30 august 2013 students are hardly known for their desire to keep their accommodation spick and span , with mould often left growing in the fridge and bins overflowing with half eaten kebabs and empty cans of cider			0
so perhaps it is only fitting that this year 's ugliest building award has gone to the new @entity14 digs at 465 @entity15 , which judges ' struggled to see as fit for human occupation '			1
described as a ' @entity18 ' , it saw off stiff competition from runner - up @entity20 - also built as student accommodation - which has infuriated residents for blotting out postcard views of the dreaming spires of @entity26			1
@entity27 : the @entity14 student accommodation at 465 @entity15 refused planning permission , but a planning inspector overruled the decision room with a view : the windows of the new property are at a different level to the original facade , pictured here , meaning students stare straight at a brick wall such is public anger with that building , calls have been made for a judicial review into how it came to be approved in the first place			1
but it was 465 @entity15 in the @entity47 that stole @entity49 's @entity48 for the worst new building of 2013			1
described as an ' outrageous housing scheme ' , 465 @entity15 offered ' deep grounds for offence in it 's cavalier attitude to a historic asset , ' according to the jury			1
mind the gap : the developer retained the original frontage , but destroyed the rest of the @entity62 building to make way for the new building the magazine accused the architect @entity66 & partners of knowing ' a thing or two about grotesque overdevelopment ' , adding : the practice â€™s solution in @entity72 has to rank as the mother of all facadectomies			2
' @entity66 has declined to comment			0
the new development was built on a site previously occupied by a listed warehouse dating back to 1874			0
all but the front facade was pulled down to make way for the new building			2
the bit that was left was stripped of its windows and propped 2m in front of the historic building 's replacement			1
but the retained openings do not align with the new windows leaving students nothing better than a brick wall as a view for the unlucky occupants			0
according to @entity49 : ' of the 44 student rooms addressing @entity15 , more than half have no eye - level outlook			2
' to compensate for the fact the new building was two storeys higher than the original , the builder removed the top of the old facade and added a new floor , before sticking the original top back on again			0
@entity49 said : ' one might hope that these compromised rooms represent the worst the development has to offer , but many of those facing away from the street promise to be grimmer still			0
' when @entity72 council refused planning permission in 2009 , it identified 151 of the units as ' suffering from poor outlook ' , 179 as not receiving ' good daylighting ' , and 60 as not having ' adequate privacy '			0
controversial : @entity26 's @entity20 student accommodation was pipped to the post by @entity15 some of the rooms overlook each other from windows just 5m apart			1
@entity49 pointed out residents of @entity122 just down the road are treated to a better view			2
overturning the council 's decision , the @entity125 wrote : ' there is agreement that the nature of the accommodation warrants some departure from the amenity standards that would be applied to residential accommodation intended for normal domestic occupation			2
' relevant factors in this are that individual students would occupy the accommodation for less than a year , and that its main function would be for sleeping due to intensive daytime activities taking place at the university campus			0
' @entity144 : the @entity146 building on @entity147 ( left ) , which critics say fails to blend into the @entity62 surroundings			0
right , the @entity150 ' the dumpster ' : the stark - looking @entity152 in @entity153 , @entity154 , is also part of a multimillion pound seafront redevelopment , but its skip - like shape has led to an unfortunate nickname ' lumpen ' : the 234 - room @entity160 on @entity161 in @entity162 , designed by @entity163 , is the third @entity165 building to make the @entity48 shortlist , and which building design describes as a ' travesty '			1

@entity14 digs described as unfit ' for human occupation '
the @entity15 building has won this year 's @entity48
it saw off competition to be named @entity177 's most ugliest new building
the judges noted *nearby* @entity122 offered better views
