by @entity0 not - so - funny bunny : hidden inside the ear of the bronze sculpture of @entity4 is the rabbit which @entity7 officials demand be removed a 30ft sculpture of @entity4 has angered @entity10 officials as the sculptors left a ‘ signature ’ on the artwork – a sculpted rabbit tucked inside one of the bronze ears			1
the bronze memorial , which was unveiled outside the government complex in @entity7 , after @entity4 ’s funeral on december 16 , is billed as the largest statue of the @entity10 leader in the world			1
officials demand that the miniature rabbit is to be removed from the statue , claiming it mocks @entity4 and his life ’s work			1
the department of arts and culture said it did n't know the two sculptors , @entity33 and @entity34 , had added a rabbit , said to be a discreet signature on their work			2
the bronze rabbit , sitting on its haunches with one floppy ear , is about half the height of the ear canal			2
‘ it does n't belong there , ’ said @entity44 , a department spokesman			0
‘ the statue represents what everyone in @entity10 is proud of			0
’ his department said in a statement that there are discussions on ‘ how best to retain the integrity of the sculpture without causing any damage or disfigurement			0
’ the giant work stands with arms outstretched , symbolizing @entity4 's devotion to inclusiveness , outside the @entity62 , where the his body rests			1
earlier this week , @entity10 's @entity65 newspaper quoted the artists as saying they added the rabbit as a ‘ trademark ’ after officials would not allow them to engrave their signatures on the statue 's trousers			1
they also said the rabbit represented the pressure of finishing the sculpture on time because ‘ haas ’ - the word for rabbit in the @entity81 - based @entity80 - also means ‘ haste			0
the government had appointed @entity96 , a heritage development company , to manage the statue project			0
ceo @entity98 , son of anti-apartheid figure @entity99 , said he was furious when he heard about the rabbit , and said it must go			0
‘ that statue is n't just a statue of a man , it 's the statue of a struggle , and one of the most noble in human history , ’ @entity99 said			2
‘ so it 's belittling , in my opinion , if you then take it in a jocular way and start adding rabbits in the ear			0
’ it would be , he said , like depicting @entity120 president @entity119 with a mouse in his nose			0
never forget : the bronze memorial , which was unveiled outside the government complex in @entity7 , after @entity4 's funeral on december 16 , is billed as the largest statue of the @entity10 leader in the world @entity99 said the artists , who belong to @entity10 's white @entity131 minority , were selected for their talent but also in part because the project was a multi-racial effort in keeping with @entity4 's principle of reconciliation			1
he said their signatures could be added on the statue in a discreet place , perhaps on @entity4 's heel .			1
