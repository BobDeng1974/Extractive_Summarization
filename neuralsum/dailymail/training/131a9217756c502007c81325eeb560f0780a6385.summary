the sharpest and largest image ever taken of the @entity1 - the nearest spiral galaxy to our @entity3 - has been revealed by astronomers			1
it shows more than 100 million stars and thousands of star clusters embedded in a section of the galaxy ’s pancake - shaped disc stretching across over 40,000 light - years			1
the sweeping view , which reveals one third of our galactic neighbour , also suggests that the galaxy may have been battered by a collision with another galaxy two billion years ago			1
click on the image to zoom in @entity19 of the @entity20 in @entity21 told @entity22 that the image hints at an older wave of starbirth that had previously only been spotted in one area of @entity1			1
‘ no one would have guessed it was galaxy - wide ’ , he said , suggesting there may have been a major collision in the galaxy ’s history			0
the panoramic image has 1.5 billion pixels — meaning you would need more than 600 @entity37 television screens to display the whole image			1
it traces the galaxy from its central galactic bulge on the left , where stars are densely packed together , across lanes of stars and dust to the sparser outskirts of its outer disc on the right			0
the large groups of blue stars in the galaxy show the locations of star clusters and star - forming regions in the spiral arms , while the dark silhouettes of obscured regions trace out complex dust structures			1
underlying the entire galaxy is a smooth distribution of cooler red stars that trace @entity1 's evolution over billions of years			2
scroll down for the video this image shows dust lanes , which are bands of interstellar dust , observed as a dark swath against the background of a brighter object			2
other features , including stellar clusters , @entity3 stars , and star - forming regions are highlighted			1
the large groups of blue stars in the galaxy show the locations of star clusters and star - forming regions in the spiral arms this image , captured by @entity79 , is the largest and sharpest image ever taken of the @entity1 , otherwise known as @entity1			1
this is a cropped version of the full image and has 1.5 billion pixels			2
you would 600 @entity37 television screens to display the whole image it ’s widely accepted than in 5 billion years our @entity3 will collide with the nearby @entity1 - but what will happen when it does ? in a new simulation revealed in september , scientists showed the intricate process that will take place , with the two central supermassive black holes merging into one			1
and the newly formed super-galaxy , dubbed ‘ @entity96 ’ , will also ultimately spell disaster for @entity98 as our planet is flung out into interstellar space			0
the simulation was created by a number of institutions led by the @entity104 ( @entity105 ) in @entity106			0
in the simulation it can be seen how the two galaxies will interact as they approach each other			0
first , in a tentative meeting , they will ‘ swoop ’ past each other , possibly disrupting some of the orbits of stars in the arms of each spiral galaxy			2
then , after separating , the two galaxies will accelerate towards each other again			0
as @entity1 is larger than the @entity3 , with one trillion stars in the former compared to about 300 billion in the latter , it will technically be the one ‘ eating ’ our galaxy			2
the @entity3 is also expected to ‘ eat ’ two nearby dwarf galaxies , the large and @entity125 , at some point in the future			0
the @entity1 is a large spiral galaxy - a galaxy type home to the majority of the stars in the universe – and the clarity of these observations will help astronomers to interpret the light from the many galaxies that have a similar structure but lie much farther away			2
because the @entity1 is only 2.5 million light - years from @entity98 it is a much bigger target on the sky than the galaxies @entity79 routinely photographs that are billions of light - years away			1
its full diameter on the night sky is six times that of the full moon			0
to capture the large portion of the galaxy seen here — over 40 000 light - years across — @entity79 took 411 images which have been assembled into a mosaic image			1
this panorama is the product of the @entity155 ( @entity157 ) programme			0
images were obtained from viewing the galaxy in near - ultraviolet , visible , and near - infrared wavelengths , using the @entity162 aboard @entity79			0
this view shows the galaxy in its natural visible - light colour as photographed in red and blue filters			2
this wide - field view shows the @entity1 ( @entity168 31 ) along with its companions @entity170 ( below centre ) and @entity172 ( upper right )			0
the extend of the new @entity155 survey of @entity1 using the @entity79 is shown by the irregularly shaped region and the main image presented here by the rectangle within it a compass image of @entity1 showing its position in the sky			0
the large box is the area that @entity79 imaged			0
because the @entity1 is only 2.5 million light - years from @entity98 it is a much bigger target on the sky than the galaxies @entity79 routinely photographs			1

the image shows a distance of 40,000 light - years across @entity1 - around a third of the galaxy
it has 1.5 billion pixels , meaning you would need more than 600 *hd* tvs to display the whole image
image hints at an older wave of starbirth that had previously only been spotted in one area of the galaxy
this suggests a collision with another galaxy may have battered @entity1 two billion years ago
