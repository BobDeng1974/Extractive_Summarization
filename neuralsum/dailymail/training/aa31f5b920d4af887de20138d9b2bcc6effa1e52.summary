warning : ' there is a lot of ignorance and rather dim - witted prejudice of @entity4 , ' outgoing archbishop of canterbury @entity5 said the archbishop of @entity8 announced his decision to stand down yesterday – and took a parting shot at the ' dim - witted prejudice ' of those who are trying to suppress @entity4			1
dr @entity5 said he will quit at the end of the year to return to academic life as master of a @entity17 college			1
hinting at the pressures of the job , he said he hoped his successor would have ' the constitution of an ox and the skin of a rhinoceros '			1
his departure came at a time of continuing rancour inside the @entity28 over the rights of gay clergy and the appointment of women bishops			0
outside there is deepening controversy as ministers try to impose same - sex marriage and remove the right of @entity38 to wear the cross			2
but dr @entity5 said he believes @entity4 will survive the assault of those who believe faith has no place in public life			1
' i think there is a great deal of interest still in the @entity4 faith , ' he said			0
' although i think there is also a lot of ignorance and rather dim - witted prejudice about the visible manifestations of @entity4 , which sometimes clouds the discussion			1
' i do n't think that there is somehow a single great argument that the @entity28 is losing			2
' the archbishop , 61 , resigned after ten years at @entity60 , a shorter tenancy than his predecessor @entity62 , who was five years older than dr @entity5 when he chose to retire			1
his period in office as the 104th archbishop of @entity8 was marked by difficulties and continual church in - fighting			1
dr @entity5 , who is married to theologian @entity68 , is known as a warm and humorous man , who said early in his tenure that he liked to watch @entity72 cartoon series with his two children			1
he is known not to carry a mobile phone and also told the @entity75 in 2008 that @entity76 was one of his favourite films			0
past and future ? archbishop of york dr @entity80 , left , is now tipped to replace archbishop of @entity8 dr @entity5 , right , who announced his departure yesterday dr @entity5 and his wife have been careful to keep their children , @entity87 , now 16 and doing his gcses , and his daughter @entity89 , who is 24 and doing a master 's degree , out of the public eye			1
a favoured candidate of @entity28 liberals , dr @entity5 had the worst possible start as archbishop when he was faced with the selection for the first time ever of an openly gay priest for a bishop 's job			1
the choice of @entity103 @entity102 as @entity104 was almost certainly inspired by the assumption in 2003 that the new archbishop , a long - time supporter of gay rights , would warmly endorse the appointment			0
crowning moment : dr @entity5 married prince @entity110 and @entity111 at @entity112 on april 29 last year in front of millions across @entity114 and the world but dr @entity5 forced dr @entity102 to step down and the powerful @entity28 gay lobby has never forgiven him			1
the archbishop however can look back on success in promoting the cause of women bishops and the personal and corporate success of @entity110 and @entity111 's royal wedding last year			0
he will relinquish his role in december to take up the post of master of @entity126 in @entity127			0
his decision to step down won warm tributes , particularly from the colleague who is favourite to succeed him , archbishop of york dr @entity80			1
@entity133 : the archbishop of @entity135 , dr @entity80 is a seen both as a visionary and controversial character who is known for stunts like sky - diving with the @entity139 , pictured in 2008 , as well as cutting up his dog collar on live tv dr @entity80 said : ' archbishop @entity5 is a remarkable and gifted leader who has strengthened the bonds of affection			1
' @entity145 said : ' as a man of great learning and humility , he has guided the @entity28 through times of challenge and change			0
' dr @entity5 gave an interview in which he let slip his impatience with some secular critics of @entity4 and spoke of the pressures of his job			1
i think that it is a job of immense demands and i would hope that my successor has the constitution of an ox and the skin of a rhinoceros really			1
' but he will , i think , have to look with positive , hopeful eyes on a church which , for all its problems , is still for so many people a place to which they resort in times of need and crisis , a place to which they look for inspiration			0
' i think the @entity28 is a great treasure			0
' dr @entity5 ' own worst moment is likely to have been his speech on sharia law in 2008 , when his advocacy of the legal recognition of @entity184 law in @entity114 briefly threatened to tip him out of @entity60			2
the hot favourite to be the next archbishop of @entity8 and first black leader of the @entity188 has become well known for his strong opinions on the state of @entity114 society			2
dr @entity80 , pictured right , the sixth of 13 brothers and sisters , and a former barrister and judge , came to the @entity114 in 1974 having fled @entity199 where he was a critic of the dictator @entity200			2
dubbed by some as ' cleric of the people ' he has most recently had a public row with the government over gay marriage , accusing @entity145 of acting like a ‘ dictator ’ and overruling the @entity208 if he chose to legalise it			2
he attracted controversy - and racist emails - when he spoke out against this issue			0
recently he also launched a tirade against @entity114 's financial institutions and bankers for their role in the collapse of the @entity114 economy			0
using the words of @entity220 , the third @entity221 , he said : ' banks are more dangerous than a standing army			0
they can destroy individuals , communities and nations			0
' famously in 2007 he cut up his dog collar on live television in a dramatic protest against @entity233 ’s rule , vowing never to wear the symbol of his office again until the @entity237 president had been removed from power			0
he has also pitched a tent and camped in @entity240 for a week , and sky - dived to raise money for families of servicemen wounded or killed in @entity245			0
in an attack on @entity247 he also argued the country must do more to mark @entity249 on april 23 , warning a failure to do so would lead to greater political extremism			0
dr @entity80 ’s enthronement in 2005 featured a ceremony with @entity256 singing and dancing and contemporary music , with the cleric playing @entity256 drums during the service			2
such is his popularity in his archdiocese of @entity135 that he was named @entity264 in 2007			2
as @entity265 in @entity266 , dr @entity80 acted as an adviser to the inquiry into the racist murder of @entity270			2
he has also campaigned against guns , knives , drugs and gangs			0
dr @entity80 is married with two grown - up children and two grown - up foster children .			1

archbishop of @entity135 dr @entity80 is tipped to replace him when he leaves at the end of the year
' it has been an *enormous* privilege being archbishop of @entity8 , ' he said
despite *waning* *congregations* he believes that the church is not losing popularity just that too many ' do n't know how religion works '
he *slammed* the ' ignorance and dim - witted prejudice ' of those against people wearing a cross around their neck
*pm* @entity145 expressed his *gratitude* to dr @entity5 for his ' support and advice ' while in @entity300
my successor will need the ' constitution of an ox and the skin of a rhinoceros , ' he said
