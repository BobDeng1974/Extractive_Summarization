unmanned spy drones could patrol @entity2 ’s shores looking for illegal immigrants and smugglers after a series of high - level meetings in @entity7 , @entity8 has learned			1
the @entity9 aims to spend £ 260 million on its ‘ @entity15 ’ project , which includes a plan for surveillance drones to patrol the @entity14 coast			1
at the same time , several schemes are under way in @entity2 , aiming to develop civilian roles for aircraft based on the killer drones hunting @entity22 terrorists in @entity23 and @entity24			1
all - seeing : surveillance planes with military - grade cameras would be more effective at monitoring the coastline than satellites or standard planes if the high - tech measures against terrorists , illegal immigrants and smugglers in the @entity14 are successful , there would be pressure on the @entity2 to follow suit			1
surveillance planes with military - grade cameras would be more effective at monitoring the coastline than satellites or standard planes			2
@entity2 defence firms are testing sophisticated ‘ sense and avoid ’ systems on unmanned aerial vehicles ( @entity42 ) over the @entity44 and some experts believe @entity47 civilian airspace could soon see drones flying alongside other aircraft			1
meanwhile @entity50 are working on a £ 3 million project with partners in the @entity2 , @entity53 and the @entity54 to explore the use of unmanned aircraft to patrol its coastline and the @entity58			1
a spokesman said the likely targets would include ‘ organised criminals , such as people - smugglers ’			1
@entity15 , which is about to go before the @entity63 , involves small drones being deployed along the @entity14 coastline , and is a response to the large numbers of illegal immigrants crossing from @entity69 in small boats			1
the umbrella body for @entity9 border agencies , @entity73 , which came up with the idea , has hosted demonstrations by defence companies for member states to show them the range of drones available			1
one of the craft , the @entity82 - built @entity81 , has a 10ft wingspan , cruises at 60mph and can stay up for eight hours			0
the larger @entity85 - manufactured @entity84 is 26ft long and can fly for 52 hours at 35,000ft			0
eye in the sky : small drones could be deployed along the @entity14 coastline to intercept large numbers of illegal immigrants crossing from @entity69 in small boats both can carry infrared sensors and sophisticated video cameras which send a live feed back to a remote pilot at a ground station			1
@entity73 spokesman @entity96 said @entity42 may be suited to patrolling borders			1
he added : ‘ there has been some interest in these from member states for border - surveillance purposes			1
at the moment we are holding demonstrations to see if these aircraft are a viable tool for border surveillance			2
‘ they give advantages as far as the possibility of hanging around in a particular area is concerned , possibly for as long as 12 hours , which is much better than a conventional aircraft			2
’ the biggest obstacle to the operation of large civilian drones is the risk of collision with other aircraft , but mr @entity96 said : ‘ i would imagine that in the not - too - distant future there will be a legal framework in place in @entity47 to allow these aircraft in unrestricted airspace			1
’ the @entity9 wants to set up the network , which includes using satellites , by next year , so only small drones will be used at first			1
current regulations mean the operator must maintain visual contact with the aircraft and keep it within 1,500ft horizontally and 400ft vertically of himself			0
in @entity7 earlier this year , defence contractors met @entity9 officials hosted by the @entity135 as they tried to forge plans allowing drones and manned aircraft to fly side by side			1
separately , in one of the world ’s most advanced trials of @entity42 , @entity140 has teamed up with @entity2 firms @entity144 , @entity146 and @entity147 , along with @entity149 company @entity148 and @entity53 - owned @entity150 , to develop a £ 62 million part - government - funded project called @entity153			1
a spokesman for @entity140 said : ‘ it ’s important to be able to safely open up @entity2 airspace for these kinds of flights as there are many civilian applications			1
on the look out : drone pilots use a bank of high - resolution screens which play in real time images from the aircraft			0
( @entity167 picture ) ‘ we are very aware that the idea of “ robot planes ” flying in the sky can cause people to be alarmed , but the fact is that sense - and - detect technology designed to keep them safely away from other aircraft is currently being proved			2
’ @entity179 , @entity153 ’s programme director , said the specially converted @entity181 aircraft being tested over the @entity44 can detect and avoid other aircraft as easily as a piloted plane			1
he was confident regulators would give @entity42 the green light sooner rather than later			2
‘ we might see some experimental uses of @entity42 by perhaps 2015 , for example on coastguard patrol , ’ he said			1
privacy campaigner @entity189 , director of @entity190 , believes that border surveillance drones may not be far off			1
‘ border control is one of the biggest pressure points			2
we ’re seeing an increasing demand to stick a drone in the air because it ’s cheaper than a helicopter			0
‘ the danger is that we all end up being watched , but if something happens there ’s no one there to help you because they ’re all manning the controls			2
’ the idea of unmanned drones humming around us , gathering our data , identifying us through photo - recognition and making their own decisions about whether to fire missiles , sounds like a dystopian vision of the future			1
in reality , the creation of autonomous robots is still a long way off , if it ever were to happen			0
the scenario imagined by so many @entity221 films , in which they could become uncontrollable killing machines , is simply the stuff of science fiction			0
yet the potential use of unmanned drones in @entity2 is growing increasingly likely			1
it is inevitable that @entity2 will want to use technology to protect its borders			2
future force : the @entity233 @entity232 is investing heavily in unmanned technology such as drone aircraft , similar to the one pictured any such plans would undoubtedly be met with hand - wringing from those who worry about breaches of civil liberties			2
indeed , human rights lawyers have already warned of litigation against the government			0
but @entity2 should press ahead with its use of drones in warfare			1
indeed , not just in warfare – unmanned technology has many applications , is big business and can only benefit our economy			0
in war , there has only ever been the well - equipped and the less well - equipped			0
those who refuse to get on board with technology end up on the losing side of any battle			0
robots are nothing to fear			0
this technology is an industry that @entity2 ’s economy could do with leading			2
the @entity233 @entity232 is putting out billion - dollar purchase orders for unmanned technology			0
a decade ago , less than five per cent of the @entity233 military ’s aircraft were unmanned			0
now more than 40 per cent fly without pilots on board			0
the few small companies selling kits , parts and accessories for private , amateur hobby drones in the @entity2 are doing very well			1
we need to make sure that @entity2 companies profit on the large - scale applications , too			2
there will be no shortage of takers because the applications – and thus future markets – are limited only by the imagination			0
drones can dust crops with pesticides , monitor atmospheric pollution , patrol for forest fires and carry out aerial land surveys			2
photographers are looking to use drones equipped with cameras to provide them with a whole a new angle on their profession			0
civilian drones have plenty to offer governments , too			0
in @entity233 , @entity300 has been flying drones over mountainous or desert regions where human - traffickers and drug - smugglers operate with impunity			0
life saving technology : drones were used by search - and - rescue teams looking for survivors after the @entity312 earthquake police - operated drones flying above our cities will enrage those who complain about @entity2 ’s wide cctv coverage			1
but most of us understand that when someone goes missing , it is a benefit to have cameras to capture their last recorded movements			0
drone technology already saves lives			0
we send drones in to inspect the state of nuclear power stations , and the @entity233 military lent drones to search - and - rescue teams looking for survivors after the @entity312 earthquake			0
but there are hurdles to overcome			0
there have been concerns over the high crash rate of military drones and critics warn of a future where drones are dropping from the sky several times a day			0
but these problems are being ironed out			0
the accident rate for drones is already lower than that for small , single - engined private aircraft			0
another problem is the potential for collisions			0
before drones fill our skies , they will have to be equipped with avoidance systems to minimise the possibility of accidents			2
@entity2 would do well to capitalise on the rising interest in drones , not bow to the worrywarts and squander the chance to lead the world in this new aerial revolution .			1
