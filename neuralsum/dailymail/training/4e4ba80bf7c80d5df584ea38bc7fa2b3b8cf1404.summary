@entity0 had a good game in difficult circumstances			1
he is a strong referee who uses cards liberally in @entity4 â€” but this is the @entity6			2
referees have been told to be cautious with their cards and remember that a player misses a game for just two bookings			0
as an @entity20 fan i was screaming at the television when @entity28 players made heavy tackles			0
but there were plenty of dives by @entity20 players and @entity37 and @entity38 were allowed to escape after strong challenges			0
@entity20 can have no complaints about the referee who was fair and impartial			2
in the book : @entity21 captain @entity24 was shown a yellow card early on for handball let off : @entity24 was not punished for this elbow on @entity20 striker @entity46 after he had been booked calm down : @entity0 gestures towards @entity20 captain @entity47 as @entity48 looks on			1

@entity21 beat @entity20 2 *-* 1 to all but *end* the @entity20 ' hopes of *qualifying* for the last *sixteen* of the @entity6
referee @entity0 could have sent off @entity24 for a second yellow but *decided* not to
the referee *nonetheless* had a good game
