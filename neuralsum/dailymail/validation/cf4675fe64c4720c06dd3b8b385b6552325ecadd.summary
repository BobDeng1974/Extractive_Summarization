anger : @entity7 , 32 , claims his nose was bitten off , left and right , during his work @entity2 but is furious after police shelved their investigation because he was too drunk to remember what happened after checking @entity29 at possible locations and hunting for witnesses , officers found nothing so were unable to record the incident as a crime and suggested he may have fallen over			1
mr @entity7 fears the person who attacked him may now never be caught and denies he fell because he had no grazes on his hands , elbows or knees			1

people still stare at me wherever i go , in the shop , on the bus , i get people looking at me			0
' i just ca n't get my head around the fact that this has happened to me and i do n't know why			1
' he had been enjoying a @entity2 do with his colleagues from @entity9 's @entity55 when the mysterious incident occurred , during the early hours of december 22 , 2013			2

the police say i could have tripped or fallen , but i have no other bruises on my knees or hands			2
and i was wearing my glasses and they did n't break			0
' the police have now written it off because i ca n't remember what happened			1
i thought it happened outside @entity59 but i ca n't be sure			1
