by @entity0 a baby who was beating a cancer - like illness , died unexpectedly and suddenly after contracting a deadly infection			1
when he was just five months old @entity5 was diagnosed with @entity6 - a rare blood cell disease which affects around 50 children a year and leads to painful sores all over the body			1
it began as a red dotted rash and he was referred to a dermatologist			2
the condition had affected his liver and spleen			0
rare disease : @entity5 had @entity6 which affects around 50 children a year after 11 months of chemotherapy , @entity5 went into remission and his mother @entity20 , 27 , began to plan their future together			1
around the same time he contracted chickenpox after his elder sister @entity24 , five , picked it up but @entity5 was said to have been treated appropriately and treatment was successful			1
tragedy then struck just two weeks later after he was seen by doctors at @entity28 for chemotherapy			2
the following day he appeared floppy and unwell and miss @entity20 dialled 999			1
he was rushed to @entity30 by ambulance and was said to have been suffering from fever in keeping with septic shock			0
he underwent treatment during resuscitation and was stabilised on a ventilator before his condition deteriorated - he died on april 15			1
dr @entity38 told the inquest that @entity5 underwent treatment during resuscitation and was stabilised on a ventilator before his condition deteriorated			1
giving her opinion on his death she said : ' my opinion is that @entity5 succumbed to an overwhelming infection			1
' after 11 months of chemotherapy , @entity5 went into remission and his mother @entity20 , pictured , began to plan their future together after an inquest into @entity5 ’s death @entity53 , of @entity55 , @entity56 , said : ' what happened to @entity5 was the cruellest blow as he appeared better and happier than he had ever been in his whole life			1
' he had been absolutely fine the day before his death and had gone to sleep with a smile on his face			1
' a couple of days before that he had started to learn to crawl and we were planning holidays because before that we could n’t take anything for granted			0
i was n’t even able to cuddle him			0
' life was getting back to normal and we were able to play with him and we could take him out - not to the park because it was a bit too risky - but we went to the shops			1
' the disease had more or less gone and we thought it was the end of it			2
' it was the light at the end of the tunnel			0
he always had a good prognosis			0
everything was always really positive and he was always really positive			0
' what happened to him seems so cruel especially when he seemed to be so much better			0
' heart - breaking : @entity5 was beating the rare disease when he caught chicken pox , which led to a fatal infection as soon as @entity5 was diagnosed doctors put him on chemotherapy , which was intensified at @entity88 tests could not prove if @entity5 had a viral infection or if was linked to his chicken pox but he had a lower than usual immune system			1
speaking outside the inquest mrs @entity20 said : ' as soon as @entity5 got the diagnosis in april 2013 , the doctors put him on low dose chemotherapy until @entity88 when they changed it to intense for three months			1
' he was on chemotherapy all over @entity88 and at one stage was really poorly and lost his hair			0
' ' he never got to go to a park because of the risk of infection and germs , even if one of the family had a cold we had to keep them away			2
we may as have well have put a cross on the door - he was that susceptible			2
a cold could wipe him out			0
' he was in pain and it was heart - wrenching that you could n’t cuddle him because that ’s all you wanted to do			2
' when he started the chemo his skin got better and you could give him cuddles almost straight away			0
@entity5 's mother @entity121 was unable to cuddle him due to painful sores which blistered and covered tiny body ' but you would not believe what he went through and i do n’t know of many grown - ups who have been through as much as he had been through in 17 months			1
' my @entity5 was always smiling			1
there ’s pictures of him in hospital with oxygen up his body and tubes and attached to a blood transfusion and laughing			2
he had 63 blood transfusions			2
' the nurses used to laugh because instead of having a toy in his hand he would have a plastic syringe			0
' that morning i did n’t realise how ill he was because death had never been an option for @entity143 i phoned 999 and they said they had to put sirens on and in my heart of hearts i knew			0
' his body had gone into shock			0
he had chemotherapy at @entity153 on the monday and he was laughing with doctors and it was normal and then the following day he was ill and died			0
' always smiling : @entity5 's mother devastated @entity121 said her son was an inspiration during his short life ' we ’re just so devastated			1
whatever life threw at him , @entity5 seemed to fight on and was an inspiration			1
' he was a very happy child who always had a smile on his face			2
we explained to @entity24 that he had gone to heaven and he was poorly			0
' she writes letters to him in heaven and posted them to him and has a memory box of him so she can look at him whenever she wants			0
' recording a narrative conclusion , the coroner mr @entity169 said that @entity5 had ' succumbed to an overwhelming infection ' and because of his ongoing maintenance chemotherapy his immune system had been low			1
he said he still may have died even if he was n’t on chemotherapy			0
mr @entity169 told mrs @entity20 : ' i know there are no words i can express that will take away any of the pain			2
' i ca n’t begin to imagine what that must be like , i know coming here must not have been easy			0
