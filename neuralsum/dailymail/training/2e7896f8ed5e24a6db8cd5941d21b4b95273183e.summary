by @entity0 published : 05:26 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 09:47 est , 27 march 2013 whistleblower : @entity3 board member @entity2 says she can not understand how some hospitals were declared safe hospitals with high death rates and poor care standards were registered as safe despite @entity10 's main health watchdog knowing there were serious failings , a whistleblower has revealed			1
@entity2 , who is on the board of the @entity14 ( @entity3 ) , said the organisation routinely ignored concerns at a number of @entity19 trusts despite being set up to protect patients			1
the alleged whitewash came as the @entity23 public inquiry into up to 1,200 unnecessary deaths was announced in 2010			1
patients there were so neglected they forced to drink stale water from vases , sit in their own excrement for days while others were sent home with life - threatening injuries or died following routine operations			1
@entity2 believes ' finding another @entity34 had to be avoided at all costs ' , so the @entity3 decided to call potentially dangerous institutions safe as part of a cover - up			1
' the @entity40 public inquiry was underway and it had been said by @entity41 that @entity40 was a one - off and there was a real sense that finding another @entity34 had to be avoided at all costs , she told @entity46 's @entity45			1
' there were a number of hospitals where the problems were well - known and yet they were registered as fully compliant and subsequently inspected as fully compliant			1
' ' cover up ' : after the scandal at @entity53 a @entity3 board member has said that others known to have problems were passed as safe to avoid bad publicity violent : what happened in @entity58 , where up to 1,200 died , has caused national outrage and mass protests among trusts concerned , she said , was the @entity64 and @entity65 which is under police investigation following the deaths of a number of babies			1
the @entity3 was set up under @entity70 in 2009 to replace three other quangos and improve standards			2
yet it has been hit with many problems in its short life			2
its head of the care was forced to resign with a taxpayer - funded pension pot of £ 1.35million last year			2
@entity79 ( above right ) agreed to leave after a damning official inquiry concluded it was not doing enough to inspect hospitals , care homes and gp practices properly - exactly what it was set up for			1
the @entity3 has also been accused of rating hospitals as ‘ good ’ even though patients were dying from poor hygiene			2
and mps on the health select committee said it was more obsessed with box ticking than carrying out inspections of hospitals and care homes			2
in 2011 the @entity3 annual report said it carried out 15,220 inspections in the previous year			0
it admitted later it was only 7,368			0
weeks later it emerged that the regulator had spent millions of pounds on plush refurbishments , staff junkets , @entity103 meals and , staggeringly , more than £ 300 on @entity105 doughnuts			0
a total of 30 families are reported to be taking legal action against the trust over mother and baby deaths and cases of cerebral palsy			0
managers have been accused of covering up patient deaths as they chased the prize of foundation trust status			0
@entity118 became a foundation trust in 2010 despite warnings from the regional director of the @entity19 regulator that patients ’ lives were in danger			0
in 2011 it had the highest mortality rate of any trust in @entity129			0
ms @entity2 said the @entity3 was aware of serious problems at the trust in late 2009 and the beginning of 2010 but in april 2010 it was registered as fully compliant			1
' it just does n't make sense			0
there is no way that the trust could have turned itself round in two or three months , ' she said			0
' it seems to me that @entity3 gave assurance about the trust that was n't actually accurate			0
' it was a very shocking thing to find thinking that an organisation that 's there to protect patients had effectively given what amounted to false assurance and that meant that problems in the trust carried on unacknowledged and unaddressed			2
' she claims a total of 15 hospitals were being investigated over high mortality rates time , yet they were give a clean bill of health			2
' it does raise the question as to why those trusts were registered as fully compliant			1
it seems that the @entity3 knew about the concerns , they knew about the high mortality rates - that is something that i ’ve only just become aware of - and it concerns me greatly that @entity3 had that info and yet registered these trusts as fully compliant at the time , ' she said			1
mrs @entity2 's was the @entity170 commissioner for 11 years and a trustee of charity mind			1
action : @entity174 with campaigner @entity175 after meeting with other @entity176 the @entity19 campaigners who say that they had to take matters into their own hands as complaints were ignored at @entity58 and elsewhere victims : a tribute wall made by family members remains at @entity184 in @entity58 in memory of patients who have died at their local hospital damning : @entity188 published a 1,700 page report with 290 recommendations following ' appalling care ' at a @entity58 hospital @entity3 chief executive @entity193 , who took over last year , said an independent review was under way into what happened at @entity118			1
' the allegations that have been made are very serious , ' he told the today programme			0
' i am absolutely committed that @entity3 will be an open and transparent organisation			0
we will publish this report and we will be accountable for the work that we do			0
' a @entity3 spokesman added : ' we are changing the way we inspect hospitals and making other changes to the way we work			0
these include strengthening the board and senior management team , for example by recruiting a chief inspector of hospitals , a chief inspector of social care and a chief inspector of primary care to lead our inspections			0
' the matters @entity2 have raised are not new and have been reported and discussed internally and externally			1
@entity3 is committed to being an open and transparent organisation , focussed on making sure health and social care services provide people with high quality care that they have a right to expect of health and care services			0

whistleblower @entity2 says failing hospitals were hidden from public
' finding another @entity235 had to be avoided at all costs ' , she said
between 2005 and 2009 up to 1,200 died unnecessarily at @entity238
' there were hospitals where problems were well - known , yet they were registered as fully compliant , ' she said
@entity14 says independent review is underway
