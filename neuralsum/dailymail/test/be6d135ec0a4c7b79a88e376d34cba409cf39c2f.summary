we do n't blame her			0
@entity8 's football fan boyfriend made her take an @entity1 test and did n't dump her thanks to her a grade the test took the form of a school exam , with multiple choice questions , tables to complete , and ' in your own words ... ' section			1
there were even ' helpful ' instructions including ' read every question at least twice ' and ' check your answers if you have time at the end '			0
oh , and ' calculators may be used '			0
@entity8 scored an impressive 87 per cent , but according to her unnamed boyfriend 's feedback she ' could have performed better on @entity42 ' , needs to ' learn all player positions ' and should understand that ' @entity44 are scum '			1
what does the ' fc ' in @entity1 stand for ? what is the nickname for @entity1 fans ? who is the current manager of @entity1 ? is the kit below ( see picture ) @entity1 # s current home kit or away kit ? name the starting 11 squad of this season in their relevant positions			2
in your own words , explain why @entity62 is better than @entity63			0

' she struggled to come up with the 11th player of the starting squad ( @entity95 , defence , apparently ) and thought @entity96 was defence and @entity98 a midfielder , when in fact they are midfield and striker respectively			2
she scored some decent points for her more creative answers			0
asked to explain why @entity62 is better than @entity63 in her own words , she wrote , ' @entity62 is buff , scores lots of goals , @entity63 is a p * * * k , @entity62 is @entity112 '			0
she got double marks for the @entity63 comment , but only got half a point for the last one			0
@entity8 clearly knows how to keep her boyfriend happy , as she humoured his question of ' why are @entity1 the best team to ever grace @entity80 football ? ' with the answer of ' they 've won many @entity123 ' and ' @entity124 is a legend '			1
however , when she got an answer wrong , her examiner wrote the correct answer in capitals and drew an angry face			0
this man clearly means business			0
doh ! @entity8 struggled to name all 11 players of the starting squad and got confused on the player positions @entity8 's boyfriend drew an angry face when she got a question wrong - this man means business @entity8 kept her boyfriend happy with creative answers to his questions , and got double marks for some ... he was impressed with the end result , though , grading her an @entity145 and rewarding her by not ending their relationship			1
and they say romance is dead			0
comments generally hailed the man as a ' legend ' and fellow football fans were impressed with @entity8 's knowledge			1
some @entity15 users hailed the unnamed boyfriend who tested @entity8 on her @entity1 knowledge as a legend scoring 87 % , football fans were impressed with @entity8 , claiming her as ' proper gf material ' may men felt inspired , with @ lewisxweeked warning his girlfriend to ' get revising ' indeed , @ gstarrs85 congratulated @entity8 and stating that she was ' proper gf material '			1
plenty of men felt inspired by the post , with @ lewisxweekes telling his girlfriend @ @entity171 to ' get revising ' and @ @entity173 crying ' where can i get this test from ? ' others , though , felt that the boyfriend had taken things a tad too far			2
@ @entity180 stated ' football fans are nuts ' , and @ @entity182 commented ' imagine actually broadcasting that your boyfriend is the biggest biff - head ever to the world			2
' we reckon it was a bit of fun and he would n't really have dumped her if she 'd failed ... at least we like to think that 's the case			0
@entity193 wants to put his girlfriend to the test , although apparently ca n't be bothered to create his own exam @entity198 claims ' football fans are nuts ' despite appearing to be one as he holds what looks suspiciously like the @entity201 in his hands ... some thought @entity8 's boyfriend took things too far with @ @entity182 creatively naming him a ' biff - head '			1
