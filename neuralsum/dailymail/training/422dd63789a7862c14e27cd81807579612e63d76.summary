in the not - so - distant future , we could be implanted with devices that seek out infection before dissolving naturally into our bloodstream			0
researchers in @entity6 have created biodegradable batteries that travel through the body capable of wirelessly transmitting data to doctors			1
they are made from a combination of metals and cathodes which gradually melt over the course of three weeks , without releasing any harmful chemicals			2
the implantable battery , pictured , is made of magnesium foil and cathodes of iron , tungsten or molybdenum			1
small doses of these elements dissolve in the body without causing health problems , and the device produces a safe electrical current to send vital sign data wirelessly the batteries use anodes of magnesium foil with cathodes of iron , molybdenum or tungsten			1
these elements dissolve slowly in the human body and , when implanted in small doses , do not cause any additional health problems			1
the electrodes are joined together by a saline solution and the battery is coated in a biodegradable polymer known as a polyanhydride			0
a square - centimetre cell with a 50 - micrometre - thick magnesium anode and an 8 - micrometre - thick molybdenum cathode creates 2.4 milliamps of current			1
cells that produce around 1.6 volts are capable of generating a radio signal , for example			0
the batteries were developed by @entity50 and his team at the @entity6 at @entity6 @entity50 said the devices could be used to track temperature , monitor tissue development and even administer certain medical treatments and drugs			1
they will also submit this data wirelessly to doctors , for example			1
speaking to @entity61 , @entity50 said the batteries use anodes of magnesium foil with cathodes of iron , molybdenum or tungsten			1
these elements dissolve slowly in the human body and , when implanted in small doses , do not cause any additional health problems			1
the electrodes are joined together by a saline solution and the battery is coated in a biodegradable polymer known as a polyanhydride			0
during tests , the batteries were placed in water and dissolved within three weeks			2
@entity50 told @entity81 that a square - centimetre cell with a 50 - micrometre - thick magnesium anode and an 8 - micrometre - thick molybdenum cathode creates 2.4 milliamps of current			2
the current and output varies depending on the cathodes used and the size of the cell , but cells that produce around 1.6 volts are capable of generating a radio signal , for example			2
during tests , a battery , pictured left and right , was placed in water and dissolved completely within three weeks			0
the electrodes inside the batteries are joined together by a saline solution and the device is coated in a biodegradable polymer known as a polyanhydride the battery in its final stages of dissolution			2
researchers said the devices could be used to track temperature , monitor tissue development and administer drugs			0
they submit data wirelessly and the power will last for around a day @entity50 continued the power will last for around a day , and further research will be carried out to extend this time period by increasing the surface area of the magnesium foil			1
the breakthrough builds on the work @entity50 and this team carried out in 2012			0
two years ago they designed a biodegradable silicon chip that monitors temperature and can be used to prevent infection			0
these chips , however , used coils and power from an external source			0
elsewhere , @entity126 recently designed an edible sodium - ion battery with melanin pigment electrodes , but these do nâ€™t last as long as magnesium - based devices .			0
