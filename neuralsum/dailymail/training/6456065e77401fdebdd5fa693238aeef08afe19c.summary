by @entity0 published : 09:17 est , 30 may 2012 updated : 12:20 est , 30 may 2012 @entity2 's new ceo @entity1 knew that he was facing an impossible task when he was tapped as the one to fill @entity5 's iconic turtleneck			1
' @entity5 was a genius and a visionary … he ’s an irreplaceable person			1
@entity5 was an original and i do n’t think there is another one of those being made			1
i ’ve never felt the weight of trying to be @entity5			1
it ’s not who i am and it ’s not my goal in life , ' mr @entity1 said at a recent technology conference			1
' i learned a lot from @entity5			2
it was absolutely the saddest days of my life when he passed away			2
opening up : @entity2 ceo @entity1 spoke at the @entity23 tech conference in @entity24 on tuesday ' at some point late last year , somebody kind of shook me and said , it ’s time to get on			1
that sadness was replaced by his intense determination to continue the journey			0
without revealing too many details from the labs of the notoriously - secretive company , mr @entity1 said that while mr @entity5 was always going to be remembered and honored , the best way to do so would be to continue his legacy by moving forward with their various endeavors			1
' i love museums , but i do n't want to live in one , ' he said			0
' he also taught me the joy is in the journey and that was a revelation for me			0
' where that journey will lead is the next question for many @entity2 observers , as the company 's acquisitions are closely monitored			2
@entity1 , left , seen with @entity5 in 2010 , took over after mr @entity5 ' death in october of last year the television arena is one that is expected to be on the company 's radar , and mr @entity1 's comments at the @entity23 conference in @entity53 , @entity24 confirmed the theories			1
the annual conference was hosted by @entity56 which posted a video of his interview			0
@entity2 already produces set - top box product for televisions , called @entity61 , and they plan to ' keep pulling this string and see where it takes us , ' implying that it certainly is not going to be their last product in that field			1
' this is an area of intense interest for us , ' mr @entity1 said , though he refused to answer the question of whether or not @entity2 is developing a television set			1
hobby : mr @entity1 's recent comments confirm theories that the company 's next big move will be in the direction of the television industry in previous interviews , the $ 99 @entity61 unit has been dubbed a ' hobby ' within the company , and at the conference he reaffirmed such a title saying that it would remain as such even though @entity2 is not known for being a ' hobby kind of company '			1
' it ’s not a fifth leg of the stool			0
it ’s not of the same market size of the phone business or the @entity96 business or the music business or the tablet business , ' @entity92 reports mr @entity1 saying			2
secretive : in keeping with @entity2 's notoriously closely - guarded ways , mr @entity1 did not reveal any new acquisitions or plans ' here 's the way we would look at ( television ) , not just at this area but other areas , and ask can we control the key technology ? can we make a significant contribution , far beyond what others have done in this area ? can we make a product that we would want ? ' mr @entity1 also discussed the tablet and smartphone market , maintaining an almost modest stance on @entity2 's role in shaping the two fields - marking a significant personality difference from that of mr @entity5 who was known for his dramatic boastfulness of his company 's products			1
' i would n’t say we dominate ( the smartphone market )			0
i ’d say we have the best phone , ' mr @entity1 said			2
' we did n’t invent the tablet market			0
we invented the modern tablet , ' echoing himself			0
certain criticisms of the company were also discussed , including their decision to base manufacturing in @entity135 as opposed to the @entity136 , which mr @entity1 explained was a logistical move			1
factories in @entity139 have had multiple suicides , even installing nets to prevent stressed and tired workers from leaping to their deaths			0
' some people want to work a lot			0
they want to move and work for a year or two and then move back to their village and bring back as much money as they can , ' @entity1 said			1
defining products : mr @entity1 said that while they did n't create the smartphone and tablet markets , their products are the best in those fields ' on the assembly piece , could that be done in the @entity136 ? i hope so , again , one day			1
' another point of tech - world gossip fascination is @entity2 's relationship with @entity162 , a company whose grasp on the needs of the people is arguably one that @entity2 - and many others - want all for themselves			2
mr @entity1 denied that they are sworn enemies and had only positive comments when asked			2
' @entity162 is a great company			0
and the relationship is solid			0
i saw ( chief operating officer ) @entity174 ( @entity173 ) earlier outside			0
we have great respect for each other , ' he said			0
' they have their way of doing things , but people say that about us as well			0
just because they have a point of view does n’t mean we ca n’t work with each other			0

@entity1 , who took over @entity2 after @entity5 died last year , spoke on a wide range of issues about new product development and his *takeover*
