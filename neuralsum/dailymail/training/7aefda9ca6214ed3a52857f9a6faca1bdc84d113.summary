' there was a significant degree of planning and premeditation as he dismembered the body			2
' he used different tools including a small saw for different parts of the body and he used the heavier saw for other parts of the body including the spine			2
' he then lied to cover his tracks and when he talked to his neighbour @entity114 he said his father was going away with his girlfriend			2
' before leaving the flat , @entity6 set about cleaning up his crime scene			1
he went out and bought a floor and steam cleaner from @entity120 but ended up flooding the bathroom and pink droplets began to soak the walls of the flat below belonging to neighbour mr @entity114 , 67 , the court heard			0

it was the most angry i have ever been			0
' i remember being in the shower and i was washing blood off me and whilst i ’m showering i ’m calling my dad a dirty c - * - * - *			0
' by the time police discovered mr @entity8 's body it was so decomposed that he had to be identified by dental records			1
@entity178 , defending , said this was a ‘ rare ’ case and the fatal incident was a ‘ very sudden event ’			0
he told the court : ' it is very rare for someone to kill their own father			0
' we suggest the facts of the case point to a very sudden event where there was a complete lack of self control for whatever reason			0
' this particular case falls into a very unusual category as there appears to be no attempt to dispose of the body parts			2
' he is a very socially active and is a high achiever from perhaps not the most promising background			0
sentencing : judge mr justice @entity203 told @entity43 that the murder as an ' act of wickedness ' and said @entity6 was a ' deceitful ' and ' manipulative young man ' ' this was a matter in a domestic setting where the pair were sharing the accommodation and there was sudden explosion of violence			1
' we argue there was no motive whatsoever			0
' judge mr justice @entity203 described the murder as an ‘ act of wickedness ’ and said @entity6 was a ‘ deceitful ’ and ‘ manipulative young man ’			1
he said : ' i have no doubt you are a thoroughly deceitful , scheming and manipulative young man			0
' i have no doubt you planned to kill your father and planned an elaborate cover up			0
' the prosecution case , which i accept , is that the explanation for your decision to kill your father was a quarrel about the money you owed him			2
' there was evidence of an iou for £ 36,000 dated june 5 , 2011			0
' the absence of defence injuries proves you must have very quickly overpowered him and disabled him - more likely by cutting his throat			0
' you then cut him elsewhere on his head and about his body ignoring his pleas for an ambulance and the help which would have saved his life			2
' as you acknowledged when cross-examined , you watched him die			0
' @entity6 was found guilty of murder after a jury of five women and seven men took just 90 minutes to reach a verdict			1
mr @entity250 told @entity6 that he had ' shown no remorse whatsoever '			2
he continued : ' this was a cold - blooded murder but i can not be sure the killing involved sadistic conduct			1
' what then followed was a very carefully thought out and executed cover - up			0
' after spending the night in the flat you left for @entity37 , taking some £ 10,000 of your father ’s money with you			1
' in @entity37 , and later in the @entity263 and elsewhere , you spent his money and behaved as if nothing had happened			1
' you have shown no remorse whatsoever			0
' i am satisfied the seriousness of your offending was particularly high and that your motive was financial gain			0
' by killing him , you could help yourself to the large amount of cash he kept in the flat			2
' indeed , as i observed earlier , this was a cold blooded , premeditated killing			0
' a conclusion is that this was an act of wickedness			0
' balancing the limited mitigation with the aggravating factors i have identified , i sentence you to @entity284 with a minimum term of 30 years			1
' following today ’s sentencing , ms @entity286 said the past 18 months had been ' extremely traumatic from first receiving the dreadful news of @entity290 ’s death until the trial which revealed the full horror of what happened that day '			0
she continued : ' @entity290 was a loving , caring man with a hilarious sense of fun and humour			0
' no sentence can bring him back but we are satisfied that the verdict of guilty was the appropriate one for this heinous crime			0
' as a family we would like to thank people for their love and support during this dreadful time			0
' @entity308 said @entity6 had gone to ' great lengths ' to try and mislead officers and ms @entity286			2
senior investigating officer detective chief inspector @entity311 , said : ' this was a particularly gruesome murder			0
' what is clear from the evidence is that @entity6 went to great lengths to try and mislead the police and the victim ’s partner			2
' my thoughts go out to mr @entity8 ’s family and friends			1
