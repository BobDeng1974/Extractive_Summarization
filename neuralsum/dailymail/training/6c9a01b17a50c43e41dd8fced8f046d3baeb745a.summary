by @entity0 published : 11:24 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 17:02 est , 5 november 2013 a humpback whale has been seen off the coast of @entity3 for the first time			1
the huge animal , estimated to be 50ft in length and weighing several tons , has been spotted numerous times just off the beach at @entity10 in the last few days			1
local fishing crews believe the whale has been lured in close to the coastline by huge numbers of herring - which it is feasting on			1
unusual visitor : a humpback whale , pictured , has been seen off the coast of @entity3 for the first time one fisherman , @entity20 , a former lifeboat coxswain , said : ' there ’s a massive amount of herring out there - we ’re out there for the same reason - to fill our boots			1
' the conditions are perfect , and the herring i ’ve seen this year are probably the best i ’ve ever seen and i ’ve been fishing since i was 14			1
' they ’re mature , full of roe			0
i think they come back to where they were hatched to spawn			0
they should be there for the next week or so if the weather does n’t change			1
' we ’re getting them while we can , and i guess he is too			0
' at one stage the whale came within 90 feet of a fishing vessel , which had mr @entity20 's son @entity45 on board , and surfaced five or six times			1
the east coast fishermen are no strangers to marine creatures - often coming across seals , porpoises and sometimes pilot whales			2
but sharing the waters with a vast humpback whale means they must be extra vigilant			1
feast : the animal , spotted off the coast of @entity60 , pictured , is thought to be feeding on schools of herring in the @entity64 waters staying put ? experts said the animal could stay for the duration of the winter if there is enough fish mr @entity20 said : ' you do n’t want to get one of those in the nets			1
' we use drift nets and if we accidentally catch a seal or a porpoise , which happens sometimes , it ’s not too hard to get them out before we do any harm			2
' i ’m not sure we could say the same with a whale			2
it ’s a big , big animal			2
the first thing we saw was the blow coming out the water , and you can smell it			0
” while the @entity3 whale seems to be alone , humpbacks are known to feed using an unusual technique called bubblenet feeding			1
the technique sees groups of the animals work together to capture large schools of fish			0
each whale has its own role in the process			2
one blows bubbles around the school to keep the fish from escaping , while others make noise to scare or confuse the fish and help bring them to the surface			0
finally , others herd the fish together and force them upwards			0
once the fish are at the surface , all the whales lunge upwards with their huge mouths wide open and try to gulp as many fish as they can			2
experts believe the humpback could stay off the @entity3 coast for the whole winter if there is enough food			1

@entity3 wildlife artist @entity145 observed the whale from the shore for four hours			1
he is now completing a painting which recreates the scene as it surfaced off @entity149 , with a spray of vented seawater hanging on the wind as gannets circled above			0
@entity145 , 43 , said ' i am fortunate enough to have seen humpbacks in @entity156 , but i ’m more excited about seeing this one here			0
i spent four hours solid just watching it			0
' by the time i first saw the spout there were quite a few people there to look			0
it was quite easy to spot once you got your eye in			0
' i reckon it was about a mile off , but you could see it blowing against the steel - coloured sea			0
