@entity0 were left to rue a succession of missed chances once again as @entity3 collected a point at @entity5			1
the @entity0 had done everything but score in the midweek defeat here to @entity10 and they were left kicking themselves again after a match in which they could easily have racked up four or five			0
at least the sense of deja - vu did n’t include another defeat , with @entity16 sliding in an equaliser with 13 minutes left to spare them after @entity20 ’s clever low free - kick had ricocheted off the base of the post			1
@entity23 celebrates giving @entity3 the lead at a wet @entity5 the @entity26 midfielder sens @entity27 the wrong way from the spot to give @entity3 the lead @entity16 looks dejected after missing a chance - but he would eventually get his goal to equalise but that was the only one of @entity0 ’s 27 chances to count and @entity35 will be concerned that his strikers are so profligate as they bid to bounce back immediately to the @entity37			1
he will also be irked by @entity27 ’s rush of blood to the head late in the first half when the goalkeeper recklessly brought down @entity43 and @entity23 calmly stroked home a penalty to give @entity3 the lead against the grain of the game			1
with @entity49 held at home by @entity51 , the @entity0 remain on their @entity53 perch but @entity54 will return top if they beat @entity56 on sunday			2
@entity35 made two changes from the team beaten late on by @entity10 in midweek , restoring @entity59 for his first league start of the season in place of @entity63 and brining in @entity64 for @entity65			0
@entity66 brought in @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 to the side that ended a five - match winless run against @entity73 on tuesday			0
and the @entity74 carved the first opportunity of the afternoon when @entity77 ’s deep free - kick was knocked down at the back post by @entity68 only for @entity67 to get his feet in a muddle with the goal gaping and allow @entity27 to scramble clear			1
@entity82 ( right ) is put under pressure by @entity3 goalscorer @entity23 @entity85 ( right ) and @entity86 tussle for the ball as @entity0 and @entity3 fought out a 1 - 1 draw @entity0 : @entity27 4 ; @entity89 ( c ) 6.5 , @entity90 6 , @entity64 6 ( @entity91 74 ) , @entity92 6.5 ; @entity93 7 , @entity59 6 , @entity94 6.5 , @entity82 6 ( @entity20 63 ) ; @entity16 7 , @entity85 6.5 subs not used : @entity96 ( gk ) , @entity65 , @entity63 , @entity97 , @entity98 scorer : @entity16 ( 77 ) booked : @entity27 @entity3 : @entity100 7.5 ; @entity69 6 ( @entity101 70 ) , @entity68 ( c ) 7 , @entity86 7 , @entity102 6 ; @entity103 6 , @entity23 6.5 , @entity104 6 , @entity105 7 ( @entity106 66 ) ; @entity107 6 , @entity67 6 subs not used : @entity109 ( gk ) ; @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 scorer : @entity23 ( 42 pen ) booked : @entity104 referee : @entity117 6.5 attendance : 26,114 man of the match : @entity100 in torrential @entity122 rain , table - topping @entity0 quickly found their rhythm			1
@entity125 @entity124 looked dangerous every time he touched the ball and his square pass led to @entity94 blazing over from a very good position			0
@entity16 , seeking to add to his six goals so far this season , was a constant torment to the @entity3 defence and he drove a shot wide from the edge of the area after @entity82 showed good awareness to tee him up			2
powerful frontman @entity16 dominated in the air and twice headed wide , firstly from @entity92 ’s left - wing cross and later from @entity124 ’s pinpoint free - kick from the right			1
the match had started to lose its fizz but an extraordinary 42nd minute ignited things once again			0
@entity3 keeper @entity100 pulled off an incredible double save , initially to deny @entity85 ’s header from a @entity93 free - kick , then to block @entity16 ’s point - blank follow - up			1
@entity16 also saw a shot blocked off the line by @entity86 during the same goalmouth scramble			0
the @entity74 , lucky not to be behind , then broke with pace and precision , a dangerous long ball over the top prompting @entity27 to clatter @entity67 and @entity23 made @entity0 pay from 12 yards			1
@entity0 , who enjoyed 65 per cent of possession , started the second half with intent and @entity85 fired a ball across the goalmouth that was just begging for a touch			0
but sometimes @entity0 ’s sloppiness in passing proved their downfall			0
@entity107 pounced on a slack @entity82 pass and played in @entity67 , who drove his shot wide of the far post			0
those in the crowd in yellow and green groaned their disapproval			0
just after the hour , @entity124 ’s free - kick caused carnage as it fizzed across the box , with @entity3 somehow managing to hack it to safety , @entity92 takes a shot at goal despite the close attentions of @entity3 defender @entity68 @entity68 gets to the ball ahead of @entity0 striker @entity16 , who scored his side 's only goal two minutes later , substitute @entity20 ’s shot deflected off @entity16 and wrong - footed @entity100 , only to strike the base of the post			1
@entity0 ’s pressure had become as incessant as the drizzle and @entity94 drew a smart save from @entity100 , who also had to push away @entity92 ’s wicked curling cross from underneath his crossbar			2
despite @entity0 ’s dominance , @entity3 still posed an occasional threat on the counter-attack , with @entity59 clearing off the line from @entity68 ’s header from @entity23 ’s cross			2
there really could be no complaints when @entity16 found himself in the right place at the right time to knock in @entity0 ’s equaliser 13 minutes from time			2
it was the 27 - year - old ’s seventh in eight matches this season but any celebrations were cut short when his knee collided with the post in the act of scoring			0
the pain was worth it for the point gained , though @entity0 were left feeling they should have taken more and indeed they could have done when @entity68 sliced over his own goal deep into stoppage time .			2

@entity23 gives @entity3 the lead from the penalty spot after @entity27 brought down @entity43
@entity16 equalises inside the final *15* minutes after @entity20 's free - kick hit the post
@entity100 made a number of decent saves to secure a point for the @entity74
would have been two home defeats in a week for @entity0 , who stay top on goal *difference*
newly - promoted @entity3 17th in the early @entity53 table
