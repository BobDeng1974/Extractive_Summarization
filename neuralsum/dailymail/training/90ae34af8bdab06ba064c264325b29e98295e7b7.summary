@entity1 chairman @entity0 could barely be heard amid boos and heckles as he told shareholders at the club 's annual general meeting of an ' @entity7 ' pervading through @entity9 football			1
@entity0 and his fellow board members were roundly booed as they took to the stage on the @entity13 pitch little over 12 hours after announcing @entity14 had been removed from his position as manager and placed on garden leave			1
@entity0 , @entity18 and brothers @entity19 and @entity21 were greeted with chants of ' out , out , out ' , ' sack the board ' and ' scumbags '			2
@entity1 chairman @entity0 ( left ) and director @entity21 arrive at @entity13 on monday morning @entity1 director @entity25 arrives at the club 's stadium for the annual general meeting @entity1 chief executive @entity18 steps out of a taxi as he arrives at @entity13 stadium @entity1 board members ( from left ) @entity25 , @entity0 , @entity18 and @entity32 rangers have major self - inflicted financial problems and need to recoup most of their £ 8.3million annual losses before the end of the season just to keep the club afloat			1
@entity0 attempted to deflect the blame elsewhere but his speech was roundly booed			1
he said : ' in these past 12 months , i have been surprised at a number of things			0
firstly , the highly negative aspect of most of the media reporting regarding @entity1			1
' secondly , because it is clear to me that a stronger @entity1 is good for @entity9 football , i have been very disappointed to realise that outside of @entity13 , there sadly still exists a great deal of @entity52 feeling , perhaps ( although i hope not ) even in the football establishment			1
' @entity0 also claimed that a season ticket boycott launched by former oldco director @entity55 and backed by fans has put the club in fresh peril			0
the club had 36,000 season ticket holders last term but home attendances this campaign have dropped as low as 19,000			0
@entity0 said : ' @entity1 ' return to the top flight of our game , i am sure you will agree , will be more easily achieved if everyone who cares about the club works together for the betterment of @entity1			1
@entity1 shareholders make their way into @entity13 for monday 's club @entity74 leaflets are handed to shareholders as they arrive at @entity13 on monday morning ' this turbulent year has seen people calling for a season ticket boycott , seen the disruptive creation of a season ticket trust for a while and other negative ideas			1
' such negativity is expensive for @entity1 as it reduces season ticket and overall ticket sales , increasing the likelihood that i will have to borrow money to cover the shortfalls created			1
our path to restoring @entity1 to where we all want the club to be can only be achieved with the continued support of all supporters , shareholders and business partners			1
' @entity0 , who has placed assistant manager @entity97 in charge of first - team affairs , also said there had been a ' chasm between the talented young players being developed at @entity103 and our first team '			2
former @entity1 chairman @entity105 ( centre ) arrives at the club 's stadium former @entity1 director @entity109 ( centre ) makes his way towards the entry gates he added : ' we need to focus on ways of developing our own young players for the first team rather than continually buying in players			1
' amid the jeering there was laughter as @entity0 admitted ' we have got more work to do ' and even louder laughter when he said : ' we need to rebuild the board with suitable people			2
' new chief executive @entity18 , who was appointed on the back of @entity129 owner @entity128 's £ 3million loan to the club , was introduced to booing but he did prompt some applause following his address			0
the former @entity129 managing director claimed he had helped the @entity135 club ' stand on its own two feet ' and would roll up his sleeves to get @entity1 back on its feet			1
he added : ' not everything i do will be popular but everything i do will be in the club 's long - term interests			0
' somers asked fans to ' refrain from any disruptive behaviour ' and added : ' if anyone gets too rowdy i will have to ask you to leave			2
' @entity14 shouts instructions to his players during his last match in charge of @entity1 on saturday he then sparked more jeers when he announced he would take two questions at a time , further enraging supporters by saying : ' when you get to be chairman of @entity1 you get to do it your way			1
' @entity0 said one of the main weapons in bridging the funding gap was a planned share issue - they need three - quarters of votes to go their way in the related resolution at the agm			0
former @entity1 player @entity165 stood up to huge applause to ask what involvement @entity167 had in the ownership of @entity103 and @entity13 and what role former directors @entity172 and @entity173 had in the club			1
he also called the @entity21 brothers ' stooges ' and criticised @entity178 for failing to have the decency to say a good word about @entity14 , ' who gave this club everything '			1
@entity0 was adamant there was no involvement from @entity167 , who put in more than £ 30million to the club during @entity189 's brief and disastrous tenure			0
and he added : ' i was fascinated when i first became chairman because some people seemed to think i was some sort of love child of @entity173 or @entity172			0
i have never met either of them and i can say the people beside me have no involvement with them			0
' i respect @entity199 's decision			0
i will never say a bad word about him			0
he will always be a @entity1 legend			2
' @entity128 ( left ) and @entity18 watch @entity129 take on @entity202 at @entity135 in may 2013 @entity0 defended the board 's decision to accept @entity128 's £ 3million interest - free loan over a £ 16million offer from @entity55 and another deal from @entity208			2
@entity0 said : ' i get frustrated with @entity55			0
i know a lot of you think he is the messiah			0
the simple reality is that i asked some simple questions because in the past @entity1 have done some terrible deals			2
they were not difficult - the same as i asked to @entity208 and @entity128 : show me the money and names of the eight people in your consortium			0
he did n't do that			0
' but the reality is he has cost the club millions of pounds with the season ticket trust and him advising people to boycott season tickets			0
' the board revealed they had a meeting with the @entity229 on tuesday to see what is expected of them in relation to disciplinary charges over @entity128 's interests in two clubs .			2

@entity1 held their annual general meeting at @entity13 on monday
