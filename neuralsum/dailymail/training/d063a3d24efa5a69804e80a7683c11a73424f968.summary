by @entity0 published : 08:13 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 15:18 est , 3 october 2012 holding it wrong # 1 : in june 2010 , @entity2 was given this email , showing @entity5 's email to ' antenna-gate ' two years ago , @entity8 users were frustrated after finding themselves with poor signals on their phone			1
@entity5 's infamously terse reply to ' @entity12 ' was , in a direct email to a user , that he was holding his phone wrong			1
now , users of the @entity8 are complaining to @entity17 after finding bright purple flares on their iphone images			2
@entity17 's response ? that users are once again holding their phones wrong - and that the purple haze , as seen in the images below , is ' normal behaviour '			1
a customer support agent called ' @entity27 ' replied : ' @entity28 , our engineering team just gave me this information and we recommend that you angle the camera away from the bright light source when taking pictures			1
' the purple flare in the image provided is considered normal behavior for @entity8 's camera			2
eventually , @entity17 backed down and offered users a free ' bumper ' , which would reduce the signal drop			0
research by tech experts showed that the metal casing worked as a ' @entity69 ' , which reduced the signal , particularly when the phone was also shielded by hand			0
later models incorporated a small gap in the casing , allowing stronger signal strength			0
a range of tech forums , include @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and many more recount tales of the camera 's woes , and users have taken to @entity87 to show off images where the ' purple haze ' appears			1
it has been speculated that @entity17 will be able to fix the issue with a software fix			0
many digital cameras and camera phones have an element of purple hazing , but it is usually minimised by either careful coating of the lens or software tweaks			0
other smartphones in the past , including ones from @entity102 , have also had the problem , but it is usually fixed due to software updates			0
users on @entity87 have posted a range of images showing the alleged fault with the @entity8 camera purple rage : sites such as cult of @entity113 report that @entity8 owners are complaining to @entity17 about the problem more images : the problem even appears on outdoor images where a strong light is not within the shot			2

@entity17 's customer support says ' purple haze ' in images is ' normal behaviour '
user told he to stop pointing his camera at light sources - *reminiscent* of @entity5 telling a user to ' stop holding his phone the wrong way '
