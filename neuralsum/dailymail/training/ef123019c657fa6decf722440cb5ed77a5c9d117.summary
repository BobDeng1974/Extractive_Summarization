by @entity0 for @entity1 among the messages doing the rounds on social media after @entity6 ’s defeat at @entity7 on sunday were a number suggesting that @entity9 had just earned himself a move to @entity11			1
however tongue - in - cheek the comments , they might not have gone down particularly well with those @entity6 fans still smarting at the way their team has been pillaged by @entity7 boss @entity18 this summer			1
@entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 have all departed @entity22 ’s for @entity23 while @entity24 moved to @entity25 for £ 27million			1
there is still plenty of cause for optimism on the @entity30 , however			0
the conveyor belt of young talent that has produced the likes of @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 in recent years has discovered another gem in @entity38			1
young star : @entity9 earned praise for his performance against @entity7 at @entity11 on sunday moved on : @entity42 defender @entity21 joined @entity7 from @entity6 this summer for £ 20m in the stands : former @entity6 player @entity20 watches his new club @entity7 in action on sunday respect : @entity7 striker @entity19 shakes hands with @entity6 manager @entity48 the 19 - year - old midfielder ’s dead - ball technique and crossing ability has already brought comparisons with @entity53			1
he scored his first goal for @entity55 with a freekick against @entity57 last october and another stunning set - piece against @entity59 was voted the best goal at this summer ’s @entity61 where @entity9 was also named among the top three players			2
at @entity11 on sunday , he enhanced his growing reputation with a succession of impressive dead - ball deliveries in @entity6 ’s 2 - 1 defeat to @entity7			1
no surprise then that he is already being tipped to follow @entity20 and his old friend @entity24 into the big - time at both club and international level			2
a young man who grew up admiring @entity53 ’s style was not even born when @entity48 ’s freekick for @entity74 broke @entity55 ’s hearts and knocked @entity76 ’ s team out of qualifying for the 1994 @entity78 , but he could not be in better hands after the @entity80 replaced @entity81 as @entity6 boss this summer			1
‘ i searched things online when we were linked with him and i found some great goals on @entity90 , ’ said @entity9 , who was used in his preferred central midfield role in @entity48 ’s first league game rather than wide on the right under @entity81			0
close quarters : @entity92 ( right ) challenges @entity7 's @entity93 for the ball during the 2 - 1 defeat under pressure : @entity92 ( centre ) is challenged by @entity7 's @entity93 ( right ) and @entity98 so close : @entity92 ( centre ) and @entity99 ( right ) react after a missed opportunity at @entity11 ‘ i ’ve studied videos of @entity53 as well and he ’s someone i do look to compare myself to in terms of set - piece deliveries			1
he was a big role model for me , not only on the pitch but off the pitch – the way he applies himself			0
’ @entity92 insists he has never touched a drop of alcohol and has no interest in the party scene frequented by so many young @entity114 footballers			2
he joined @entity6 at the age of eight after turning down their great rivals @entity117 , his hometown team			2
@entity9 , his father @entity118 and older brother @entity119 were all big @entity117 fans			0
‘ at one stage he was training with @entity6 and @entity117 five nights a week , ’ says @entity118 , a barrister			0
‘ then the inevitable happened – both clubs found out about the other			0
but it was always going to be @entity6 because of the fantastic reputation of their academy and the quality of the coaching			2
@entity130 : @entity131 star @entity34 came through the youth ranks at @entity6 younger days : @entity35 , now at @entity133 , is pictured celebrating after scoring for @entity6 in 2005 rise to stardom : @entity36 came through at @entity6 after joining their academy ‘ he flirted with cricket as something to do in the summer and he ’s quite a competent tennis player but it ’s always been about football for him			1
the first thing he did was kick			0
as soon as he could walk he had a ball at his feet and if we took that away from him he would kick his teddy bear ! ’ @entity92 turned professional at the same time as @entity24 and @entity146 – who joined @entity133 for £ 12m this summer – after making his first - team debut in october 2011			1
although he made 19 appearances in all competitions following @entity6 ’s promotion to the @entity114 and another 39 last season , many were as a substitute and he is determined to cement a first - team place under @entity48			1
the challenge now is to show that he can fill the gap left by @entity20			0
‘ it ’s a massive season , probably the biggest of my career so far , ’ said @entity9			0
‘ last season was a bit of a struggle in terms of starts and it would be good to maintain a place throughout the year			0
‘ they are big shoes to fill and @entity20 was a fantastic player for the club and a fans ’ favourite			0
hopefully that is the sort of role i ’m looking to take on myself			0
’ if @entity92 continues at this rate , @entity6 fans could be waving goodbye to another young star sooner than they had hoped			1
@entity178 encouraged by @entity6 performance			2
