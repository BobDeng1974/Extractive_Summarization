by @entity0 published : 12:03 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 12:40 est , 11 july 2012 it has been called the colour of the moment			0
as prince @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 fly the flag for natural gingers and celebrities like @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 go red by choice , there has never been a hotter time to be ginger			1
as the fashion for fiery locks gathers pace , it has become an oft - repeated cliche that every celebrity that goes red by choice makes it cooler to be ginger			2
effectively , they say , elective redheads are taking the stigma out of being ginger			1
but for natural born ginger @entity31 , who was forced to leave school after her life was made hell by bullies , this theory is nonsense			1
bullied : big brother 12 contestant @entity31 says she was forced to leave school after being taunted for years over her ginger hair appearing on this morning today , @entity31 , 28 , who appeared as a contestant on the 12th series of @entity41 , said that unless you carry the ' ginger gene ' , you can never really be a redhead			1
real gingers have freckled , pale skin , ' albino ' eyelashes and no eyebrows , she says			1
as such , fake redheads - with their ' normal ' eyebrows , their skin that tans , and their freckle - free complexions , are doing nothing to help the millions of redheads in @entity56 - four per cent of the nation - who are persecuted on a daily basis for their hair colour			1
' it annoys me when people say @entity12 is ginger			1
she 's not at all			0
she has just dyed her hair red , ' @entity31 says			1
' she is not a real redhead			1
@entity12 is beautiful – she does not have the gene – and it ’s the gene that messes you up ! the eyebrows , the eyes , the freckles – everything			1
' if you do n't have the gene , it 's totally different			1
' @entity31 , whose mother and sister both have red hair , says that from the age of seven she would come home from school in tears after being taunted by bullies			1
she had no defence mechanism to cope with it , because her family were collectively ashamed of their hair colour			0
' i grew up in a family that was embarrassed by their ginger hair , ' @entity90 says			2
' my mother had red hair			0
and when she was pregnant with my younger sister , i would hear her say , " please @entity99 , let the second one escape the ginger " '			2
outcast : @entity102 hates her ' blue ' skin and ' albino ' eyelashes - and says even her boyfriend thinks ginger girls are ' disgusting ' ' i left school for a year - i could n't face it			1
i did n't want to be a target any more			2
' @entity31 , who dyes her hair blonde in sessions costing thousands of pounds every year , says it 's not just the colour of her hair that marks her out			1
she has been bullied all her life for the pale skin she says was ' blue ' , as well as her freckles and what she calls her ' albino ' eyelashes			1
' you ca n't ever get away from it , ' she says			2
' i wear so much make up			0
i put it on an inch thick because i do n't like anyone seeing my freckles			2
' i wear excessive amounts of fake tan			0
i have my eyelashes tinted every weekend and spend a fortune in the hairdressers when i go every three weeks			0
' i 've ruined my hair			0
i 've dyed it so many times it 's falling out			0
i have to have extensions because it is so damaged			0
' and @entity31 says her sister , who is also a redhead but dyes her hair brown , tells her she 'd better not leave the house without her ' albino ' eyelashes thickly coated in mascara			1
even more distressing is the news that @entity102 's own boyfriend is ' disgusted ' by ginger hair			2
' i show him photos of myself as a child and he says i look disgusting , ' she says			0
' he would never go out with me if i looked like that			0
' as for the word ' ginger ' , @entity102 considers it an insult			2
' it 's got nasty connotations , ' she says			0
it 's been used for so long to bully redheads that i hate the word			2
but @entity159 , a redhead who recently launched a dating site specifically for ginger people called @entity162 , says redheads need to stand up for themselves and embrace their hair colour			1
every redhead gets teased – but that ’s when you need to step up and be proud , ' he says			0
' if you embrace it , the bullies lay off			0
' ' is it unfair that you have to fight against people over something you were born with ? yes , but children get picked on for so many things			0
for being a bit overweight , for being ginger			0
' you need to embrace it			0
' faking it : @entity11 has been dyeing her hair red since she was a little girl , inspired by @entity182 , while @entity12 , right , tinted her hair a pale red tone last year			1

@entity31 says it is the ' ginger gene ' that ' really messes you up '
@entity190 star says celebrities like @entity12 do n't have the pale skin and freckles that mark out a real redhead
@entity31 , 28 , whose boyfriend thinks real redheads are ' disgusting ' , wants the word ginger *banned*
