a @entity1 father is outraged after officials at his daughter 's school accidentally released the child to a complete stranger last week			1
@entity7 , 31 , from @entity8 , says staff at @entity10 put the life of his 3 - year - old daughter , @entity13 , at risk by allowing her to go home with a woman who mistook the toddler for her granddaughter			1
the grandmother had not seen her granddaughter for nine months when she went to the @entity8 school last week to pick up the girl , also named @entity13			1
it was not until the 3 - year - old arrived home that the mix - up became apparent and @entity45 was promptly returned back to the school			2
but according to @entity7 , his 3 - year - old , who suffers from a peanut allergy , could have died in the time it took the other family to bring the child back			1
‘ the grandmother said , “ i took her to the store and i gave her a granola bar , " ’ @entity7 told @entity57			2
‘ well , she has a peanut allergy , so it was a miracle she did n't eat the peanut version			0
’ officials at @entity10 realized that @entity45 was sent home with the wrong person when her mother called the school to say she was coming to pick up the toddler , but was told that the girl already had been picked up by someone else			1
' within minutes , the school principal realized the mistake and she worked quickly to ensure the child was returned safely to the school , which she was ( within 30 minutes )			1
our head of security was notified , and so was the child 's mother			0
' school spokeswoman @entity79 said in a statement			0
close call : mr @entity83 said the woman who picked up his daughter , who suffers from a peanut allergy , bought her a granola bar , which luckily did not contain nuts mr @entity83 , who himself is a school principal at @entity89 in @entity90 , said his young daughter was left shaken by the incident			2
furious : @entity7 , who works as a school principal , said officials at his daughter 's school were negligent ‘ she keeps telling me , “ i went to the lady 's house and then the man yelled out , ' that 's not our baby , bring her back , ’ ’ he said			2
‘ she remembers that stuff			0
’ @entity7 added that little @entity13 is now afraid to go back to school because she does not want to end up with the other family			1
according to the father , officials at the @entity8 school , which has some 340 students from pre-k to second grade , failed to contact police to report his daughter missing in violation of their own policy , and then contacted the grandmother instead of calling him or his wife first , @entity109 reported			1
‘ how can we trust that they 're going to keep any child safe ? ’ he wondered			0
the school administration has suspended a security guard and a teaching assistant without pay for allowing letting @entity45 go home with a stranger			0
in the aftermath of the mix - up , the school now requires adults to show identification before picking up a child			0
mr @entity83 has reported the incident to child protective services and contacted an attorney			0
meanwhile , the school district has hired an investigator look into the matter .			0
