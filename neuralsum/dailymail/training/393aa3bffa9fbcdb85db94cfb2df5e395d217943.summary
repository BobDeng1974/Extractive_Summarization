' @entity16 was taken off on his first start for @entity2 as the @entity108 striker works towards full fitness @entity19 refused to criticise referee @entity88 for awarding the penalty against @entity87 even though the @entity111 was fouled by @entity29 in the build up			2
' it was only 3 - 2 at the time , that was not a problem , ' he said			1
