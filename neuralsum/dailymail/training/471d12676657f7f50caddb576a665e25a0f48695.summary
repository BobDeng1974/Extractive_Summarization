only by @entity0 a new app called @entity2 was launched in @entity3 this month to connect potential clients with nearby prostitutes using their phone 's gps capabilities			1
it is described as a cross between the car - ordering service app uber and the dating app tinder			2
clients log into the app and type in what they want : body type , eye color , personality traits , and the maximum price they are willing to pay			2
it then uses gps to match them with nearby sex workers , who must be independent sex workers and pass an interview			1
@entity37 , the creator of the app , says she wanted to create a tool that prevented sex workers from waiting in the cold to find clients			1
@entity37 says she pre-interviews people who wish to use the app to make sure they are working voluntarily and independently in the business			0
' we have a short conversation to get the feeling that this is voluntary and they are independent sex workers , ' she said			1
' we try to ask them - you kind of find out in a conversation whether they 're doing it on a voluntary basis - we ask them what they did before , whether they 've always worked voluntarily and so on			0
' @entity37 says she came up with the idea after seeing sex workers out on the streets			2
' the story always sounds corny , but it 's true , ' she told @entity3 start - up magazine @entity65			0
' like tinder for prostitutes ' - @entity2 app launches in @entity3 to connect prostitutes with clients ' on a late autumn day in @entity73 , i was on my way with a friend to a bar on @entity77			1
' it was cold - i had a skirt on myself - and i saw a sex worker on the street			0
' i thought , ' it 's crazy that there 's an app for everything , but not for that			0
' why do they have to stand there in the winter all day ? ' that thought never left me , '			0

@entity2 app only available in @entity73 - where prostitution is legal
