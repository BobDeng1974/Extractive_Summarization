it could help us find @entity2 like planets - and even spot a ' second @entity2 '			1
high in the @entity7 desert , the @entity4 ( @entity5 ) has begun automatically scanning the skies the project is a wide - field observing system made up of an array of twelve telescopes , each with an aperture of 20 centimetres			1
it will search for transiting exoplanets — planets that pass in front of their parent star and hence produce a slight dimming of the star 's light that can be detected by sensitive instruments			2
the telescopes will focus on discovering @entity19 - sized and smaller planets , with diameters between two and eight times that of @entity2			1
the new facility , built by a @entity36 , @entity38 and @entity39 consortium , is located at @entity41 's @entity40 in northern @entity7 and benefits from the superb observing conditions and excellent support facilities available at this site			1
the telescope has now achieved first light			0
' we needed a site where there were many clear nights and the air was clear and dry so that we could make very accurate measurements as often as possible — @entity54 was the best choice by far , ' says @entity56 of the @entity57 in the @entity36 and one of the @entity5 project leads			0
the telescopes are designed to operate in a robotic mode and it will continuously monitor the brightness of hundreds of thousands of comparatively bright stars in the southern skies			1
it is searching for transiting exoplanets and will reach a level of accuracy in measuring the brightness of stars — one part in a thousand — that has never before been attained with a ground - based wide - field survey instrument			2
the telescopes are designed to operate in a robotic mode and it will continuously monitor the brightness of hundreds of thousands of comparatively bright stars in the southern skies			1
the discoveries of @entity5 will be studied further using other larger telescopes , including the @entity41			2
one goal is to find small planets that are bright enough for the planetary mass to be measured			2
this will allow planetary densities to be deduced , which in turn provides clues about the composition of the planets			2
it may also be possible to probe the atmospheres of the exoplanets whilst they are in transit , researchers hope			0
the @entity4 ( @entity5 ) is a wide - field photometric survey designed to discover transiting exoplanets of @entity19 - size and smaller around bright stars			1
@entity5 will survey brighter stars than @entity101 's @entity100 mission , and will therefore find the brightest exoplanets of @entity19 and super-earth size , providing the prime targets for characterization by telescopes such as the @entity108 , e-eltand @entity109			1
bright targets provide the key to understanding planetary structure and evolution , as well as atmospheric composition			0
@entity5 is sited at the @entity115 's @entity40 in @entity7 , home of the @entity108 , which meets strict requirements for low water vapor and excellent photometric conditions			1
this is the first telescope project hosted , but not operated , by @entity41 on @entity54 , and strengthens the synergy with @entity41 's telescopes			2
before it was built , the @entity41 demonstrated all key technologies using a prototype system , which operated on @entity124 during 2009 and 2010 , and at the @entity125 from 2012 - 14			0
during the transit some of the star 's light passes through the planet 's atmosphere , if it has one , and leaves a tiny , but detectable , signature			0
so far only a few such very delicate observations have been made , but @entity5 should provide many more potential targets			0
the @entity5 data will flow into the @entity41 archive system and will be available to astronomers worldwide for decades to come			0
@entity137 , one of the @entity5 project leads from the @entity57 , concludes : ' we are excited to begin our search for small planets around nearby stars			0
the @entity5 discoveries , and follow - up observations by telescopes on the ground and in space , will be important steps in our quest to study the atmospheres and composition of small planets such as the @entity2			1
' the discoveries of @entity5 will be studied further using other larger telescopes , including the @entity41			0
@entity41 operates three unique world - class observing sites in @entity7 : @entity156 , @entity54 and @entity157			1
at @entity54 , @entity41 operates the @entity108 , the world 's most advanced visible - light astronomical observatory and two survey telescopes			2
@entity161 works in the infrared and is the world 's largest survey telescope and the @entity165 is the largest telescope designed to exclusively survey the skies in visible light			0
@entity41 is a major partner in @entity170 , the largest astronomical project in existence			0
and on @entity173 , close to @entity54 , @entity41 is building the 39 - metre @entity174 , the @entity174 , which will become ' the world 's biggest eye on the sky '			0
the telescopes will focus on discovering @entity19 - sized and smaller planets , with diameters between two and eight times that of @entity2 .			1

next - @entity4 is made up of an array of twelve 20 cm telescopes
located at the @entity40 in northern @entity7 , it will operate automatically
will focus on discovering @entity19 - sized and smaller planets , with diameters two and eight times that of @entity2
