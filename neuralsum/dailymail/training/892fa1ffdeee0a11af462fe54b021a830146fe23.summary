crowds will once again flock inside the @entity1 , after the @entity3 government backed plans to rebuild the ancient amphitheatre 's arena floor			1
some 1,500 years after barbarians were devoured by wild beasts for the crowd 's enjoyment , @entity11 , the @entity3 culture minister , said that people should be able to ' enjoy monuments by bringing them to life '			0
currently the labyrinthine corridors and cells for wild animals and slaves that were built under the arena lie exposed after excavations in the last couple of centuries			0
mr @entity11 said the reconstructed arena where 35,000 watched fights , executions and animal hunts could be used for ' classical concerts , theatrical spectacles or productions of ancient plays ' , although he drew the lines at football matches			1
he told a press conference in @entity25 yesterday : ' i am convinced that with an intelligent reconstruction of the arena of the @entity1 , the symbol of this country , it could become much much more attractive			2
' ' imagine the beauty of going up in the original lifts that could have carried gladiators up to the arena and seeing the @entity1 from the centre as they would have seen it			2
' the corridors and cells for wild animals and slaves that were once hidden under the arena floor are currently exposed after years of excavation archaeologist @entity68 , pictured , said the plan to replace the arena 's long - disappeared floor is aimed at restoring the @entity1 to its original state so visitors can better appreciate its ancient splendor ' we are not talking about @entity76 v @entity77 , but if we choose classical music concerts , ancient plays , spectacles that have an enormous commercial value clearly in terms of the tv rights '			1
earlier he tweeted images of plans by archeologist professor @entity68 of @entity87 adding : ' all it will take is a bit of courage			0
' archaeologist @entity68 of @entity87 university said his suggestion to replace the arena 's long - disappeared floor is aimed at restoring the @entity1 to its original state so visitors can better appreciate its ancient splendor â€” not turning it into a heavily trafficked concert venue			1
' it 's the most normal idea in the world , ' @entity68 said			0
critics have feared the @entity1 would be turned into a venue for rock concerts , viewed as both unbefitting of its stature as an ancient wonder and likely to inflict damage to the structure already weakened by earthquakes , notably in 443 and most recently in the 1700s			1

those utilitarian spaces were covered by the wooden floor of the arena itself during the nearly five centuries that the @entity1 functioned as a center of entertainment , with spectacles including exotic animal hunts and sea - battle re-enactments			1
@entity3 are not in principle against using their ancient monuments as backdrops for entertainment			0
@entity146 's @entity145 , a @entity147 amphitheater , attracts thousands each summer to its opera series , and performances are set regularly among the @entity150 in @entity25			0
the @entity1 itself has housed occasional performances , and is visited every year by the pope during the @entity154			2
the @entity1 , however , enjoys a unique status as the most predominant symbol not only of @entity25 , but of @entity3 , making sensitive any discussion about altering the status quo			2
' it is so important and bulky in its presence , that to transition it into a venue where you perform opera is beneath its dignity , ' said @entity166 , a structural engineer who is one of @entity3 's leading experts on the @entity1			1
' the image of the @entity1 needs to remain beyond that practical use			0
it needs to remain an icon , a point of reference with all its history and its past			0
