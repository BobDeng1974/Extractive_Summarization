a 17 - year - old boy has undergone the world 's first penis reduction surgery , surgeons claim			1
the @entity5 teen requested the surgery after his penis grew too large , restricting his ability to have sex or play competitive sports			1
the boy 's surgeons were shocked when he came to them complaining that his penis was too big			2
when flaccid , it measured almost seven inches in length and had a circumference of 10 inches - around the size of a grapefruit			1
surgeons described it as being shaped like an @entity21			2
the surgeon who treated the teenager , @entity23 , a urologist at the @entity24 , told @entity25 : ' there comes a time in every urologist 's career that a patient makes a request so rare and impossible to comprehend that all training breaks down and leaves the physician speechless			1
' that question was " can you make my penis smaller " ? ' a 17 - year - old boy in @entity37 is thought to be the first person to undergo penis reduction surgery			1
the teenager requested the operation after his penis ( pictured on an x-ray ) grew too large the teenager had suffered from several bouts of priapism - an unwanted erection , due to having a condition in which abnormally - shaped blood cells block vessels in the penis , causing it to swell			1
these episodes had left his penis bloated and misshapen			0
he said he was unable to have sex or play competitive sport , had difficulty wearing his pants due to his ' large and heavy phallus ' , and was embarrassed by how visible it appeared underneath regular clothing			2
though his penis was so large , it did not grow when he had erections - it merely became firmer			1
' his penis had inflated like a balloon , ' said dr @entity23			0
' it sounds like a man 's dream - a tremendously inflated phallus - but unfortunately although it was a generous length , it 's girth was just massive , especially around the middle			1
' it looked like an @entity21			0
' dr @entity23 and his team looked at the medical literature but could n't find any precedent for what to do			0
' lord knows there 's a global race on how to make it longer and thicker in plastic surgery circles , but very little on how to make it smaller , ' he said			0
in the end , they decided to embark on a surgical technique normally used to treat @entity86 's disease , a condition where scar tissue develops along the penis , causing it to bend			2
the surgeons sliced along an old circumcision scar , unwrapped the skin of the penis , and cut out two segments of tissue from either side			0
' it was a bit like having two side tummy - tucks - that 's how we explained it to him , ' said dr @entity23			2
the teenager said he was unable to have sex or play competitive sport , had difficulty wearing his pants due to his ' large and heavy phallus ' , and was embarrassed by how visible it appeared underneath clothing ( file pic ) the doctors were able to bypass the urethra - the tube which carries urine through the penis - and all of the nerves that provide sensation			1
the teenager spent just two days in hospital before returning home , apparently ' ecstatic ' with his new penis			0
the doctors did not take final measurements of the penis , although dr @entity23 told @entity25 the result was ' generous '			1
' it 's slightly longer and slightly thicker than the average male , but now it looks symmetrical , and the patient was very satisfied , ' he said			0
the teen now has no problem having normal erections and has full sensation			0
' it looks cosmetically appealing , and he said it was a life - changing event , he 's all smiles , ' said @entity23			1
since the paper describing the surgery was published in @entity141 , dr @entity23 has only had one person approach him to request the same surgery			0
he said : ' this [ second ] man seems to have a naturally large penis , because there 's nothing unusual in his medical history , so it does n't seem like there 's any real abnormality in this case '			1
whereas the first teenager had an obvious medical condition that needed treating , performing surgery on someone who is completely healthy but having difficulties with the size of his penis is another matter , said dr @entity23			2
' these are controversial waters we 're stepping in , ' he added			0
' who is to judge what is a legitimate complaint and what is n't ? ' you do n't normally have men complaining about this kind of thing			0
these are very unique cases			0
