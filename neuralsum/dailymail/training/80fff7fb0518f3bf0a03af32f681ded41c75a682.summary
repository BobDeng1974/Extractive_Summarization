the internet went into overdrive when @entity2 and @entity3 were revealed as the new @entity5 campaign stars			1
a few tweeters were , however , convinced that the pop star had a little help to make his muscles look more defined , with one tweeting : ' they airbrushed @entity2 to the high heavens ! ' despite his naysayers , the @entity14 singer has revealed that he worked extremely hard to whip his body into shape for his latest gig			1
he said : ' i work out with my trainer , @entity32 , five days a week for about 45 minutes each			1
' we do three - days splits : back and triceps one day , chest and biceps on day two , shoulder and legs on day three , and abs every other day			1
' i 'm not on a special diet , but i do try to watch what i eat			1
i do eat unhealthy sometimes - i am a 20 - year - old guy ! ' tweeters pointed out that @entity2 's abs seem slightly more defined in the campaign shots compared to a softer appearance in the video co-starring @entity3			1
another user tweeted : ' they airbrushed a lot of muscle onto little @entity2			1
' @entity52 has contacted @entity5 for comment			2
how did he do it ? @entity2 says he works out five days a week for about 45 minutes each to achieve his toned look for the @entity5 campaign @entity2 's abs look more ripped in the campaign shots , left , compared to a grab from the shoot video , according to critics on social media @entity2 is known for working out a lot and has gradually built up his muscle with bodybuilding over the years			1
the singer is so committed to working out that he has even been seen in the gym while recovering from a broken foot			2
in a video posted online , @entity2 can be seen walking into a weights room with crutches before putting them aside to do some pull ups			1
@entity3 , meanwhile , has publicly documented her road to her post-pregnancy body			1
comments : @entity20 came alive with speculation over the young popstar 's muscles the 31 - year - old recently revealed that her pregnancy - and the months afterwards - were less about ' earth mother ' perfection and more about bloating , limp hair and self - criticism			1
she admits that she developed a love of fried food and that it took her a while to slip back into her pre-pregnancy jeans			2
but the supermodel , who gave birth to her first child - @entity93 - with @entity94 in may 2013 , worked hard to shift her post-baby pounds and shows off the fruits of her labour in the new shoot			2
@entity3 works out with @entity99 guru , @entity98 , who developed a ' super gentle ' routine for her to follow			1
co-star : model @entity3 has been working out with @entity98 to get back in shape after having a baby the programme , which they shared on @entity106 , involves five key moves , designed to provide all - over toning and fat burning specifically for those who have n't exercised for some time such as new mums			1
the first exercise involves keeping your feet on the floor with your toes up - which engages your glutes - before slowly raising your hips and squeezing your buttocks			2
this simple move is repeated about 10 times			1
' they are so easy to do anywhere like in a hotel , ' @entity3 says			1
@entity98 claims the next move , @entity125 , is the ' supermodel secret to a flat tummy '			1
it involves kneeling on a mat on all fours before extending and retracting the opposite leg and arm simultaneously			2
other key moves involve the basic squat while inhaling on the way down and exhaling on the way up , and leg lifts using a resistance band round the knees to add resistance			2
the final move the power pair love is the ' non-surgical boob lift ' , which involves going into a half - squatting position and holding that while fully extending the arms outwards and upwards			2
' this really engages all the muscles that are going to lift up your chest , ' @entity98 explains			2
@entity3 works out with @entity99 guru , @entity98 , pictured left , who developed a ' super gentle ' routine foodwise , @entity98 gives @entity3 healthy meal plans with dishes such as sesame - crusted chicken with avocado and spinach salad and clean and lean oat pancakes			1
the key to @entity98 ’ philosophy is to eat clean foods ( as close to their natural state as possible ) , cut back on @entity162 ( caffeine , refined sugar , alcohol and processed foods ) , eat lots of good fats ( nuts , avocados , oily fish ) and limit bad fats ( bacon fat , pies , processed meats etc )			1
@entity98 says : ‘ if it did n’t once fly , swim or walk , or was n’t pulled from the ground , from a bush or a plant , do n’t eat it ! and you do n’t have to get this right 100 per cent of the time			1
if you aim for 80 per cent , you ’ll be okay			2
’ the new @entity5 images were shot by fashion photographers @entity185 & @entity186 in @entity187			2
the campaign continues the brand 's association with music and pop culture , which began with the famous shots of @entity194 ( @entity195 ) and @entity196 back in the @entity197			1
' given my on - going relationship with the house , this shoot reunited me with my @entity5 family - and it was really fun working with @entity2 , ' said @entity203			1
' we had a great time on set and we had a lot of fun shooting the campaign			1
i think the shoot really captured the energy of the @entity5 brand			2
