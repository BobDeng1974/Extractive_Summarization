@entity0 almost suffered a major wardrobe malfunction yesterday as she arrived in a short pleated navy skirt and matching jacket at @entity4 , a @entity5 - based anti-bullying charity			0
as she bent down to accept a posy from nine - year - old @entity8 , a pupil at @entity9 in @entity10 , her skirt blew up in a gust of wind			0
and it 's not the first time @entity15 's had a @entity17 moment : a feather - light @entity19 yellow frock almost cost @entity15 her modesty at @entity22 in september 2011 , and she almost came a cropper in a floral @entity25 dress as she arrived at @entity27 airport in 2012			1
and in may this year , when seven months pregnant , the @entity15 was hit by another unfortunate gust of wind as she arrived at the wedding of friends @entity46 and @entity47 , in south @entity48			2
@entity15 was left red - faced after a breeze lifted up her £ 38 @entity51 polka - dot dress			2
this time , the offending skirt was by @entity54 skirt and her jacket by @entity56			0
she also wore a pair of gloves by @entity59 , a £ 245 @entity60 and @entity64 blue suede @entity62 bag and @entity66 heels			0
@entity15 should perhaps take a leaf out of the @entity69 's book			1
last year the @entity70 revealed how , despite conducting thousands of public engagements in her 60 years on the throne , the @entity69 ’s decorum has almost never slipped			2
slipped inside the lining of each of the @entity69 ’s exquisite hand - made outfits are a couple of small lead curtain weights , costing just £ 1.50 for a packet of four			1
whoops : a seven months pregnant @entity15 was hit by an unfortunate gust of wind which blew up her skirt and exposed her thighs the small circular weights , measure just 1.2inches ( 32mm ) across and weigh less than an ounce each - but prevent the royal hemline from flying away in a gust of wind			1
@entity19 revealed that she 'd received a letter recommending that very trick after pictures of @entity15 in her billowing yellow dress surfaced last year			1
' i had a little handwritten letter from a lady in @entity97 passionately criticising me for the primrose yellow shift dress i made for the duchess , ' says @entity19 , who was born in @entity100 , told @entity5 's @entity101 at the time			1
' she said did n't i know about putting weights around the bottom of a hem so it ca n't blow up ? ' well , i did n't know it was going to be worn on a windy runway - but i did think maybe in future i will put in more weighting , just in case ... ' disembarking : @entity0 looked elegant in the pretty floral @entity25 dress when arriving at @entity27 aiport - and successfully managed to contain her skirt when a gust of wind threatened to pick up the hem @entity117 , the @entity69 's favourite couturier , revealed the weights he uses for her dresses are sourced from the curtain accessories section of famous @entity122 department store , @entity123			1
society dressmaker mr @entity117 then neatly stitches them into the hem of her garments , which prevents them from blowing up in the wind			2
the surprisingly cheap trick seems to work , for the @entity69 has seemingly never been photographed in public looking even remotely ruffled			2
‘ the beauty of a handmade outfit is that it hangs just right but , of course , we have a few tricks up our sleeve , ’ mr @entity117 told the @entity70 in an exclusive interview			0
her pleated skirt was by @entity54 skirt and her matching navy jacket was by @entity56 @entity15 was attending the charity 's ' @entity143 in @entity145 ' at the offices of @entity34 in @entity147 , @entity5 @entity15 seemed to be enjoying the day , despite the chilly - and rather windy - weather ‘ surprisingly , it is nothing fancy			1
i use curtain weights , lead weights , from @entity123 ’s curtain department			1
we call them penny weights			0
' ‘ i just pop a couple into the hemline of her dresses and coats and it makes them hang beautifully			0
if there is a flap in the coat then i will sew in one on each side of the split to even it up			0
and sometimes if she is wearing a lightweight chiffon skirt i will sew in an even smaller lead weight the size of a pea or even a length of chain , rather like a dog ’s chain			0
but the curtain weights work beautifully			1
’ unfortunately not all female royals follow the @entity69 ’s lead and have , on occasions , fallen foul of the elements			2
the late @entity183 , @entity183 , the @entity184 and her daughter , princess @entity185 , have all suffered similar wardrobe malfunctions			0
@entity187 is one of more than 200 schools across the country which works in partnership with @entity4 to offer mental health support services @entity15 explained to the professors that yesterday on a visit with prince @entity195 to crime prevention charity only connect she had been hearing about ' sexting ' , the exchange of graphic pictures and messages on mobile phones @entity15 took the opportunity while at the event to speak to experts about early years development , asking prof @entity206 specifically about babies and toddlers the @entity69 's tailor sews @entity123 curtain weights into her hemlines to keep them from blowing away the @entity69 's dressmaker @entity117 slips small lead curtain weights , costing just £ 1.50 for a packet of four , inside the lining of each of the @entity69 ’s exquisite hand - made outfits			1

@entity15 had another @entity17 moment in september 2011 when her @entity19 dress was caught in a gust of wind on the runway at @entity22 airport , @entity39 ( left ) while princess @entity183 almost lost her composure at @entity241 in 1991 ( right when high winds whipped at her wrap - around skirt ‘ i just pop a couple into the hemline of her dresses and coats and it makes them hang beautifully			1

even the @entity69 is n't totally safe from the @entity272 weather , seen here arriving at grandson @entity195 's @entity275 base in @entity276 in april 2011			1

@entity117 sews @entity123 lead curtain weights into the @entity69 's hems
not the first time @entity15 's dresses have *misbehaved*
