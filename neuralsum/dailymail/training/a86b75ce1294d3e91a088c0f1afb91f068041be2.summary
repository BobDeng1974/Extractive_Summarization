@entity0 is beginning 2015 with a new dive in his repertoire and full of optimism about his prospects of challenging for his sport 's greatest prizes			1
the past 12 months or so have seen plenty of change for @entity0 , much of which has revolved around a switch in base and coach			2
he relocated from his native @entity13 to @entity14 , and his work there with @entity16 - born former @entity18 diving coach @entity17 has led to various adjustments in his training			1
@entity0 poses on the podium with his 10m gold medal at the @entity23 @entity0 posted this picture on @entity25 during his recent training block in @entity27 within that , the decision has been made to scrap what @entity0 had referred to as his ' demon dive ' - the backwards two - and - a - half somersault with two - and - a - half twists routine in the piked position - and replace it with a new ' twister '			1
described as a ' forward three - and - a - half somersaults with one twist pike ' , this effort has the same degree of difficulty as the old one , which had been causing @entity0 trouble for some time			1
and the 20 - year - old , who claimed 10 - metre platform bronze at the @entity45 , told @entity46 : ' i 'm actually the first person in the world to perform that ( new ) dive - it will be a world first when i compete it at the @entity50 ( in @entity13 in february ) , which is really exciting			1
the 20 - year - old posted this picture on his @entity25 account during a training block in @entity27 ' it has been done on springboard before , but never on 10 - metre			1
' it is a work in progress , but it is already working a lot better than my twister before			0
' we had to do something that was going to make it so that my dives were the best they could possibly be , and in shape to try to challenge the @entity66 , and we were never going to be able to do that with that old dive			0
' this new dive has been able to change my mindset on things , and it will also be a lot better in that the judges are going to get fresh look at a brand new dive they have n't seen before			0
' it is a risk , obviously , but you have to take risks if you want to win that medal			0
' @entity0 , seen here practising a dive at the @entity45 , returns to competitive action next month after the high of the @entity84 medal he secured in @entity14 , 2009 10m platform world champion @entity0 initially struggled for motivation and with injuries , and could only manage sixth place at the 2013 @entity88 in @entity89			1
however , following his link - up with @entity17 , he retained gold in the event at last summer 's @entity23 before claiming silver at the 2014 @entity94 in @entity95			0
he also publicly revealed around a year ago that he was in a relationship with a man - @entity98 screenwriter @entity97			2
and with @entity0 declaring he has ' never been happier with diving and life ' , things appear to be coming together well as he continues to work towards the major showpieces ahead - this summer 's @entity88 in @entity104 and the 2016 @entity105			2
@entity0 has just completed a two - week training camp with his @entity108 diving colleagues in @entity27 regarding the latter , @entity0 has just completed a two - week training camp with his @entity108 diving colleagues in the @entity113 city			1
and he is grateful to have had the chance to spend some time at the @entity84 venue			0
' it is the first time i have been to @entity118 , so the first time in @entity27 , and i have absolutely loved it , ' @entity0 said			0
' it was amazing walking into the pool for the first time - it really did feel like an @entity84 pool and it got the heart going , for sure			2
' it is really nice to come away from this camp being able to actually visualise me diving into the pool , and knowing what it looks like , what the water temperature is like , what the platform surface is like - that kind of stuff all helps			0

@entity84 bronze medallist and 2009 world champion has moved to @entity14
also changes in his dive routines , *abandoning* his ' demon dive '
the 20 - year - old will be a world first to perform his new ' twister ' dive
@entity0 expects to compete at the @entity108 championships in february
