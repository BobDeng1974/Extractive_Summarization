when @entity1 decided to do a good deed every day for a year , he could never have anticipated how much it would change his life			1
the 26 - year - old from @entity6 made the decision after a close family friend died from cancer in 2013			1
he started writing a @entity11 blog and logged every kind gesture he made on the site , which has now amassed thousands of followers			2
he has also bought countless meals for strangers at places like @entity29 and even paid for a person 's petrol just because they were stood next to him in the queue at the station tills			1
in total , @entity1 estimates that he has spent £ 3,000 in the last 12 months on good deeds , despite the fact that he was only earning the wage of a part - time shop worker			1
he said : ' in a world of taking selfies with your " besties " and @entity45 pictures of your new handbag and @entity48 watch , we forget to think about anyone else but ourselves			2
' our generation has forgotten to care about others , because we are too self - obsessed to even care what others are going through			2
' in total , @entity1 estimates that he has spent £ 3,000 in the last 12 months on good deeds , including buying meals for strangers that he meets in restaurants but while many people have been inspired by @entity1 's blog , he has also been on the receiving end of sceptical responses			1
@entity1 said : ' the majority of people love it			1
i have my haters , but that 's a given really			2
i try not to dwell too much on other people 's opinions			0
' most people to begin with did n't understand why i was doing what i was doing and became very reserved about me helping them			0
' @entity75 was rife among my monetary good deeds and some people questioned my motives and others thought i wanted something in return			2
' @entity1 decided to do a year of good deeds after a good family friend passed away in october 2013			1
he said : ' @entity18 was like a mother to me			0
she was hands - down the most incredible and inspirational woman i will ever meet			2
' when a neighbour needed food , she gave her last potato			0
when a friend needed money , she gave her last pound			2
' she gave her whole life selflessly helping others around her and at her funeral over 4,000 people queued for 3 hours to get in and pay their respects			0
' @entity1 now keeps a sweet bucket on his desk , for people to grab a quick snack			2
he also spent an evening putting kind messages on colleagues ' desks @entity1 used his love of baking in a good deed - he made lemon drizzle cakes and set them to friends and family			1
he also bought a bunch of flowers for a friend who had received some bad luck last december , @entity1 decided that january 1 would be the day that he kick - started 365 daily good deeds			1
he began with some small gestures - on @entity116 he said ' @entity116 ' to a woman serving his coffee in a @entity120 cafe			2
on the second day , he bought food and drink for a couple of homeless people in his local town centre			0
a few days later , he handed over some spare change to a lady who did n't have enough coins at the parking meter			0
since starting his challenge , @entity1 also entered a competition run by @entity132 to win the job of @entity134 , a.k.a the nicest job in @entity136			1
his good deed challenge convinced the organisers that he was the right man for the job and so , for the whole of 2015 , @entity1 will be paid to travel the @entity136 and assist 45 different charities			1
since starting his challenge , @entity1 also entered a competition run by @entity132 to win the job of @entity134 , aka the nicest job in @entity136 @entity1 doing one of his good deeds - he realised a customer in his shop had left their mobility scooter in the rain , so brought it inside and wiped it down he has also decided to extend his challenge for another year and claims the experiment has completely changed his life			1
he said : ' i think i have healed myself by helping others			0
' it really changes your perspective on life when you help people			0
you become so much more grateful for what you have			0
' i did this purely to help people as a social experiment			0
i wanted to see how helping others for a year can really help yourself			2
' i 've gone from working part time in a shop to now the national philanthropy manager where i am making my life 's work about helping others and i 've raised thousands for charity			0
' @entity1 also created @entity173 - a pack of cards with good deeds that include : ' tell your mum you love her , ' and ' tell a stranger they look beautiful			1
' the cards cost £ 5 for a deck and 25 per cent of each sale goes to the @entity184			0
good deed 345 : one of my colleagues is on crutches after snapping his @entity187			1
