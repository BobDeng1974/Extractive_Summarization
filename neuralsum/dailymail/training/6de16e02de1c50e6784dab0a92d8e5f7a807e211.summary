thousands of @entity1 families due to leave the @entity1 for a traditional @entity3 break next weekend are facing the possibility of a green @entity5			0
many resorts across the @entity7 and @entity8 had already pushed back their opening weekends from december 6 until december 13 after unusually warm temperatures caused early snowfall in november to melt across resorts in @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
but yesterday skiers at the @entity13 resort of @entity18 - which makes up half of the giant @entity21 skiing domain - found green meadows or slopes dusted with just a light covering of snow where inches of snowfall would usually have fallen by now			1
skiers were being bussed in from the resorts of @entity18 , @entity18 and @entity40 1950 to @entity18 , where a single 0.6 - mile ( 1km ) piste was in operation			1
the resort ’s daily ski report yesterday said the nearest fresh snow had fallen 77 miles ( 124km ) away			2
one @entity46 , who owns a ski chalet in @entity18 , said : ‘ there is green and brown land visible all the way up the mountain which would normally be covered in snow			2
‘ even @entity53 does n’t look itself			0
there ’s snow on the peak but it does n’t look anywhere near as plentiful as usual			0
’ the skier , who did not want to be identified , added : ‘ some of the runs here are grey , with just a dusting of powder , rather than the glistening white scene which is normal at this time of the year			0
’ locals blamed a freakishly warm november which melted an early winter snow dump at the lower resorts , and a shortage of atmospheric weather depressions which had brought few new snowfalls - even after the weather in the higher resorts dropped to the sub-zero temperatures which are normal for this time of year			1
in @entity18 - the four resorts are loosely named after the approximate altitude of each village - it is said by locals to be the worst conditions at the start of a ski season in 40 years			1
put back : earlier this month , travel experts urged holidaymakers not to panic over the delayed opening to resorts such as @entity86 ( left ) and @entity87 ( right , file pictures ) ski instructor @entity89 said : ‘ at the moment it is just about okay because the start of the season is never that busy , but from next weekend the resorts will be full for @entity5 and @entity95			1
‘ if all the ski schools and the holiday making families have only two lifts between them it is going to be chaos and a catastrophe - and no significant snowfall , perhaps only a few snowflakes , is predicted between now and @entity5			0
i have no idea what will happen and how we will manage			0
’ last thursday , @entity109 , a @entity111 weather forecaster , tweeted that an ‘ unlucky jet stream pattern this weekend ’ was preventing the @entity7 from ‘ getting significant snow ’			2
the @entity21 is the second largest linked skiable domain in the world , with 264 miles of pistes over 14,390 hectares			0
as well as @entity18 , it includes the resorts of @entity18 and @entity119			2
earlier this month , travel experts urged holidaymakers not to panic over the delayed opening to resorts such as @entity86 and @entity87			1
they said the delays would not affect @entity1 holidaymakers as the ski seasons for the majority of @entity1 tour operators do n’t start until late december			0
until 25 years ago and the advent of efficient snow - making machines , most @entity7 resorts did not open before mid-december , although the machines need the thermometer to fall to @entity133 to operate successfully			1
@entity134 , normally one of the most reliable resorts in @entity137 for snow cover , cancelled the men ’s @entity140 giant slalom and slalom races scheduled for this past weekend , despite investing in the largest snow - making machine in @entity137			2
temperatures in the resort on the first weekend of december had reached @entity145 .			0

many @entity7 and @entity8 resorts had already delayed opening weekends
unusually warm temperatures caused early snowfall in november to melt
skiers at @entity18 have found some slopes to have thin layer of snow
while the summit reportedly has 30cm of snow , the base of the resort has only a light dusting
@entity165 snow report says there has not been any in past *72* hours - and none due until thursday
