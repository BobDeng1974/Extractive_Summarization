by @entity0 in 2006 , @entity1 was offered a job in @entity3 , working for one of the country 's largest property developers			1
he and his wife @entity9 , both accountants from @entity8 , decided to take a chance on the offer and made the move to the @entity13			1
three years after they moved , @entity1 was arrested for a crime he did n't commit and spent nine months in @entity3 prisons , including two months in solitary confinement , and four years under house arrest as he fought to clear his name			1
@entity1 , 45 , and @entity9 , 50 , whose ordeal finally came to an end in january when they were able to return to @entity22 , have written a book about the experience			1
the book , trapped , consists largely of @entity1 's diary entries from the time of his imprisonment			1
in the book he tells how the process of writing about his ordeal and the love notes smuggled to him by @entity9 on her prison visits were his ' lifeline '			1
@entity1 and @entity35 went through a five year legal ordeal , which resulted in @entity1 being imprisoned for nine months after the couple relocated to @entity3 , @entity1 says ' everything was going along happily for a few years ' before he was hauled into a police station and questioned about a man he had never met and a payment his company had made to another company			1
@entity1 was able to fire off a text message to his wife , who had returned to @entity22 for her mother 's 80th birthday , telling her to get back to the @entity13 as it looked like the situation was serious			1
@entity1 would spend the next nine months in some of @entity3 's most notorious prisons			1
for six months of this time , @entity1 had not been charged with anything			2
eventually , @entity1 was charged with bribery and attempting to defraud his company @entity55 and @entity22 's @entity56 , crimes for which he was eventually acquitted			1
after receiving his panicked text message , it took @entity9 two weeks to find out where her husband had been taken			2
' @entity9 got access to me after about two weeks ; she had to first locate me			2
[ when she finally found me ] we were allowed five minutes in this meeting room , we could n't really say anything … it was just a state of utter confusion , ' he told @entity68			0
' you go to work , you do your job , you 're suddenly arrested , and there are these wild accusations			0
we 're both pretty boring accountants thrust into horrific circumstance			0
we 're not elite , we 're not high - flyers , we 're not connected , we 're just accountants , ' he said			0
@entity9 secretly took a photo from inside one of the prisons @entity1 was held in left : @entity1 and his brother @entity80 on the day he was released from prison on bail in october 2009 ; right : @entity1 and @entity9 during the period of his house arrest in @entity3 @entity1 spent the first two months in solitary confinement , in a cell 1.5 metres by 2.5 metres in size , located in the national security headquarters with the ' terrorists and threats to state '			1
he was allowed to leave his cell to go to the bathroom , as well as for three phone calls a week and a twenty - minute weekly visit from @entity9			2
after two months , @entity1 , who by this point had become very ill as a result of the ' rancid food ' , stress and ' cold , musty , dirty ' conditions , was moved to a police station with 200 other prisoners where he was kept for another two months , before being moved to the central prison in @entity104 , where he spent the five months before he was finally granted bail			2
@entity1 contracted pneumonia while in @entity104 , which he thinks may have killed him if @entity9 had not been able to visit and slip him antibiotics tablets			1
during the time he was imprisoned and under house arrest , @entity1 's father , step - father and grandmother died and he was not able to fly home for the funerals , which he said was a trauma that ' rippled through the whole family '			1
@entity1 and @entity9 were allowed to return to the country in january this year ' the visits and phone calls were the only times , other than using the bathroom , that i was allowed out of my cell			1
it was so claustrophobic in that tiny space , the walls seemed to get closer the longer i was in there			0
from time to time i would hear screaming echoing down the corridor			0
i never knew if it was the anguish of people who were being driven mad by solitary confinement or if they were being beaten or tortured			0
' i am guessing that being a white westerner conveyed some level of protection other prisoners like the @entity136 or @entity137 ones did n't have			0
the @entity22 consulate would have raised an outcry if they saw me with bruises			2
i was never beaten or directly physically threatened , although many guards acted in a menacing , intimidating way			0
one of their favourite tricks was to bang on cell doors in the middle of the night , making wild accusations or threats			0
' they would say things like , ' you 've been telling your wife lies about us beating you , have n't you ? you 've been telling the consulate lies , have n't you ? do you want to be sent to @entity157 with the rapists and murderers ? that 's what will happen to you			2
' ' i was so vulnerable by this point that the threat of being thrown to the wolves in prison was completely terrifying , even worse than solitary			0
i suppose it 's a version of the @entity168 that makes kidnap victims not want to leave their captors			0
' they would also threaten to cut off the phone calls and the weekly visits			0
that sent stabs of fear through me : @entity9 was my lifeline			2
one particularly nasty guard had a favourite taunt : i had better tell them everything i knew , he said , because if i stayed in here my wife would leave me			2
i worried about how @entity9 was coping but i knew she would stand by me			2
i told the guard he obviously knew @entity9 better than me , but the sarcasm went straight over his head			2
' this is an edited extract from trapped by @entity1 and @entity35 , published by @entity187 while in prison @entity1 began writing as a form of therapy			2
' there 's no trauma counselling over there			0
a friend said " just start writing your thoughts down "			0
one page became , five became 10 , 10 became 50			0
' the journal , which forms the basis for the book written by @entity1 and @entity9 , was smuggled out of the prison by @entity9 on her visits			1
@entity1 was allowed to write while in jail and was allowed to pass notes to his wife , but he knew that if one of his notes , which detailed the horrors he witnessed in the jail - including violence , rape , and terrible conditions - was intercepted he and @entity9 could be in a lot of trouble from authorities			1
@entity9 began slipping messages to @entity1 , writing messages , poems and love letters inside books that she was sometimes allowed to give him			1
' on the rare occasion she could get a book in , she 'd put a poem in the middle of the book , something to keep me going and remind me that there 's something there			0
' @entity1 was eventually released on bail , on the condition he , @entity9 and an @entity13 sponsor , sacrifice their passports and that they pay $ 300,000			1
@entity1 was kept under house arrest for four - and - a - half years until he was acquitted			1
prosecutors appealed the acquittal , but in november 2013 the acquittal was upheld			0
' it was a massive relief , but it did n't end there			0
we 'd accumulated so much debt , i could n't work , and we had to fight to get our bail bond back so we could pay back our debts			0
' it was not until the plane took off from @entity248 for @entity8 in january this year that @entity1 and @entity9 really felt their ordeal was over			1
they returned to the country asset-less , as they were forced to sell their family home in @entity8 because they could n't afford to keep up the repayments and @entity1 has not returned to work , saying people treat him with an ' element of suspicion ' , despite his acquittal , because of his arrest			1
for @entity1 , writing the book is a way of telling his side of the story , which gained considerable publicity in @entity22			1
' when someone 's arrested overseas , there 's this immediate thought of @entity274 , it 's not always the case … you 're trapped in the @entity280 , you 're a long way from everyone , a lot of wild speculation and spin , you 're in a jail , and you ca n't counter it in any way			0
' another purpose for the book is to shine a light on the ' literally thousands ' of other prisoners trapped in @entity3 prisons who are waiting to be tried , or even charged			1
' they 're the forgotten ones … they typically come from poorer countries – @entity136 , @entity294 , @entity137			0
a lot of them are trapped there , there 's a name for them in @entity301 , kully wully , the literal translation is " does n't matter " , they 're trapped in a never - ending cycle			0
' @entity1 feels incredibly lucky he had @entity9 and his legal team to fight so hard to free him and the couple have moved to the @entity307 where they are settling back into normal life , with their 14 - year - old dog @entity311			1
' i pinch myself every day when i realise i do n't have to go to court , do n't have the threat of incarceration			0

@entity1 was locked up for nine months in @entity3 prisons and placed under house arrest for four years
@entity1 smuggled notes written about his experience to his wife @entity9
she would write love letters and poems inside books for him to read
@entity1 , who was acquitted in november , has since returned to @entity22
they have since written a book about their ordeal , trapped
