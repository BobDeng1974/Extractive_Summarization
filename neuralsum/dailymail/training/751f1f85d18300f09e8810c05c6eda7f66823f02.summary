urgent reforms are being demanded to stop thousands of cancer patients losing access to vital medicines			2
@entity5 drug companies claim in an open letter to health secretary @entity7 that the country faces going back to ‘ clear rationing ’ within weeks			1
the @entity5 still lags behind @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 in prescribing potentially lifesaving medicines to cancer patients and the situation will get worse , it is claimed			2
new plans are set to axe up to 25 drugs deemed too expensive for the @entity19 by the @entity20 , which was originally set up to improve access to vital medicines in @entity22			1
they include all six breast cancer drugs that have been prescribed for thousands of women in the last three years			1
@entity5 drug companies have written to health secretary @entity7 warning the country faces going back to ' clear rationing ' of cancer drugs within weeks if drastic reforms are not made campaigners fear a change to the rules that take cost into account for the first time will lead to them being taken off the approved list in a controversial two day ‘ re-evaluation ’ process next month			1
other drugs that may not survive the financial cull include @entity42 , used in prostate cancer , six drugs for bowel cancer , including @entity46 , and @entity47 for pancreatic cancer			0
the £ 200million a year @entity20 ( @entity49 ) which began in april 2011 has led to around 55,000 patients in @entity22 getting drugs banned on the @entity19 by @entity52 , the rationing body			1
the government 's aim , which was a @entity56 election pledge , was to enable @entity19 doctors to prescribe any drug if they believed a cancer patient could benefit			0
it was a temporary stopgap until 2016 and @entity22 , which took over its administration a year ago , now proposes to re-evaluate a host of drugs on the basis of cost for the first time			2
the plan has sparked protest from top cancer charities and the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) which has sent an open letter to mr @entity7			0
it says the blame lies with the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) , which must be reformed and look at cancer medicines with ‘ greater flexibility ’			0
the letter says @entity22 ’s plans ‘ threaten to take the @entity5 back to a time of clear rationing of cancer medicines ’			1
instead @entity52 should adapt its end of life criteria in considering whether the @entity19 can afford ‘ life extending medicines to be available to those patients confronting the most difficult battle of all – the battle for life ’ says the letter signed by @entity69 chief executive @entity88			2
new plans are set to axe up to 25 drugs , including @entity46 used to treat bowel cancer , deemed too expensive for the @entity19 by the @entity20 , which was originally set up to improve access to vital medicines in response to calls for drug companies to cut their prices beyond discounts already given to the @entity19 , mr @entity88 says the industry does not ask for ‘ unfair returns and in the @entity5 profits are capped ’			1
the @entity49 panel will meet on december 15 and 16 to decide which drugs should be removed because they offer ‘ insufficient value for money ’ , with its decisions announced ‘ early in the @entity107 '			0
some of the 25 drugs are being re-evaluated for different cancers so a total of 42 treatments will be considered in total			0
it is thought one in six patients being treated through the fund has advanced breast cancer , who can access drugs rejected by @entity52			1
although existing patients would continue to be treated , new patients would have to make exceptional appeals to get drugs that are currently approved			0
@entity122 , senior policy manager at @entity123 , said the charity was deeply concerned that several very effective breast cancer drugs could be axed due to their high price			1
she said : ‘ the fund is the only way women in @entity22 can routinely access these drugs that can offer them months , or even years , of additional good quality life			0
@entity122 , of @entity123 , said the charity is deeply concerned about the implications for an estimated 16,000 breast cancer patients getting help from the @entity20 each year			2
picture shows breast cancer cells under the microscope ‘ the @entity20 was only ever intended to be a temporary solution , acting as a safety net for patients , but we are now facing a situation in which it may fail to perform that function for some people and more and more life - extending drugs could be snatched away from those that need them			1
’ it is estimated that ending the @entity20 will deny more than 16,000 patients annually from getting potentially life extending drugs			0
the budget for the fund has been overspent by £ 30million since @entity22 took over its running in april last year			0
the bill was met from underspends in other parts of its budget			0
@entity163 , chief executive of @entity164 @entity5 said : ‘ whilst we welcome the clarity provided by these proposed reforms , the huge deficit that has brought the @entity20 to the brink is the result of a failed drug appraisal system that continues to deny thousands of cancer patients access to effective drugs that they clearly need			1
‘ a long - term solution is urgently needed that delivers an overhaul of the way new cancer drugs are appraised			0

25 drugs , deemed too expensive for the @entity19 but available through the @entity20 , could be axed under new plans
