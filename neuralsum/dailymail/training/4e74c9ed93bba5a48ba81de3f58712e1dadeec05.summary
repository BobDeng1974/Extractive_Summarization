by @entity0 published : 10:10 est , 13 december 2012 updated : 07:43 est , 14 december 2012 jailed : @entity1 has been sentenced to two years in prison for vandalising a @entity4 painting the self - proclaimed artist who vandalised a @entity4 painting in what he said was an act of ' yellowism ' was today sentenced to two years in prison			1
@entity1 , 26 , also known as @entity10 , defaced the mural , worth around £ 5million to £ 9million , at the @entity13 gallery on october 7			1
he has said he carried out the crime in an attempt to spread the principles of the obscure artistic movement which he helped create			1
@entity1 , a @entity20 national living in @entity21 , @entity22 , admitted criminal damage to the value of in excess of £ 5,000 - but estimates suggest the restoration of the painting will cost around £ 200,000			1
the vandal stepped over a barrier in the art gallery and daubed his name and the words ' a potential piece of yellowism ' before fleeing			1
the court heard that he went to the gallery intending to put his ' signature ' on a picture , but decided to damage the @entity4 painting only in the moment he saw it on display			0
the gallery was then put into ' operation shutdown ' with people prevented from leaving or entering the building			0
@entity1 has argued that his actions were themselves a work of art , as the rules of ' yellowism ' dictate that anything can be an example of the genre as long as it is endorsed by a member of the movement			1
but judge @entity55 said of ' yellowism ' that it was ' wholly and utterly unacceptable to promote it by damaging a work of art ' which he called a ' gift to the nation '			1
art ? @entity1 claimed that his vandalism was in itself a powerful artistic statement speaking at @entity66 , he told @entity67 : ' your actions on the 7th of october of this year were entirely deliberate , planned and intentional			1
' he said it was ' abundantly clear ' that @entity1 was ' plainly an intelligent man ' and told the court he had described @entity4 as a ' great painter ' in a letter he had written to him			1
the judge also said the incident had led to galleries reviewing security arrangements at a cost to themselves and the taxpayer			0
' the effects of such security reviews is to distance the public from the works of art they come to enjoy , ' he said			0
supporter : @entity1 was accompanied by @entity88 , who attempted to explain the principles of ' yellowism ' @entity91 , prosecuting , said : ' the work required to restore this picture will be complex and lengthy			1
' complications to this work include the unique painting technique used by the artist and the fact the ink used by mr @entity1 has permeated the paint layers and the canvas itself			2
' mr @entity91 said work to restore the painting will take about 20 months and cost ' something around £ 200,000 '			0
paintings by @entity109 - born artist @entity4 often fetch tens of millions of pounds			0
earlier this year , his @entity110 sold in @entity111 for £ 53.8million - the highest price paid for a piece of @entity115 art at auction			2
the defaced painting , called @entity118 , was donated to the @entity119 in 1969 by @entity4 himself			0
outside court before the sentencing , @entity88 , who called himself a ' yellowist ' , attempted to explain the concept : ' everything is equal			0
everything is art. everything is a potential piece of yellowism			2
' after the sentencing , mr @entity88 , who had come along to support @entity1 in court , said @entity1 's time in prison would be ' one of the most creative points for him ' and will ' give him a greater understanding of humanity '			2
speaking about the incident he said : ' this was not an act of destruction			0
it was an act of creativity			0
' now yellowism is a global phenomenon			0
' a spokeswoman for the gallery said : ' @entity119 is pleased that the court has recognised the severity of this incident and its consequences when sentencing @entity1 to two years in prison			2

@entity1 , 26 , claimed vandalism was itself a piece of art
*co-founder* of obscure artistic movement of ' yellowism '
