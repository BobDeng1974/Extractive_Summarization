and he wonders why it is always him			0
just when you thought you had seen it all with @entity4 , he takes the breath away on @entity7 ’s biggest @entity6 night in five years			2
with @entity8 submerging at half - time , the evening having become an exercise in damage limitation rather than one to tell the grandchildren about as they trailed 3 - 0 , @entity4 decided to swap shirts with @entity15 defender @entity14 as he sauntered off towards the dressing room			1
having endured a dismal , uncomfortable start to his time on @entity19 , @entity4 had a glorious chance to show why @entity21 took a £ 16million gamble on him in august and made him a @entity8 player			1
@entity4 swapped shirts with @entity15 defender @entity14 as he wandered down the tunnel at half - time @entity4 endured another torrid night in a @entity8 shirt and was replaced at half - time at @entity7 @entity14 and @entity4 leave the field with the @entity15 defender putting his arm around the @entity8 forward @entity15 defender @entity32 ( left ) attempts to swap shirts with @entity34 ( right ) @entity34 pulls @entity32 's shirt down as he tries to leave the pitch after @entity8 's 3 - 0 defeat at @entity7 @entity34 gestures that he would prefer to swap shirts with his former team - mate off the field @entity32 ( left ) , with @entity34 's shirt he got in the tunnel after the match , and @entity43 ( centre ) and @entity45 instead , after barely breaking into a canter and never threatening @entity15 ’s goal , @entity4 managed to enrage two former @entity8 captains - both of whom had lifted the @entity51 - and seemingly lose the trust of his manager			1
‘ what is going on ? ’ said @entity54 , @entity8 skipper when they beat @entity15 in the 1981 final in @entity57 , when learning of @entity4 ’s faux pas			1
‘ are you joking ? oh my goodness			0
what is in his mind to do that ? he ’s having a difficult time as it is			0
‘ i do n’t care whether you ’re playing for @entity8 or a @entity67 club , you do n’t do things like that			0
that is absolutely dreadful from a @entity8 player			0
he is lucky to be wearing one , to be playing , the way he ’s been playing before			2
and he gives it away at half - time ? ’ meanwhile , @entity76 , who captained the @entity77 when they lifted the trophy by beating @entity79 in 1984 , was simmering with rage in @entity82 ’s @entity7 studio , growling : ‘ do n’t get me started			1
’ when @entity54 and @entity76 were leading @entity8 , they guarded that red jersey with their lives			1
they went to war wearing it in far , foreign lands and would not accept anything but the absolute maximum from those around them			0
each time they pulled it on was a privilege			0
@entity98 columnist @entity97 gives his verdict on @entity4 's performance on @entity101 @entity14 and @entity4 remove their shirts as they went to walk down the @entity7 tunnel with the score at 3 - 0 @entity4 and @entity14 then exchange words as both players leave the field for the half - time interval @entity14 places his hand on @entity4 's back as the forward leaves the field , not to return for the second - half some will no doubt dismiss the shirt - swapping as trivial , another @entity4 eccentricity			1
yet the main issue for @entity21 is not the souvenir he collected but what the @entity120 striker produced in the 45 minutes before his game was curtailed for what were described as ' tactical ’ reasons			1
on the touchline , as @entity8 made a bright start , @entity21 urged @entity4 to press , mouthing the words ‘ keep getting into the box ’			2
@entity8 ’s manager had said this fixture had the potential to ‘ create legends ’ - and a @entity4 winner would have sent him on that road			1
but @entity21 got nothing back from the @entity136			2
@entity21 had faith in his own ability to unlock the talent lurking inside @entity4 and was adamant that the player would seize the opportunity given to him as the transfer deadline loomed in august			2
instead , all @entity21 has had since is aggravation			0
bar one goal against @entity145 , @entity4 has not once threatened to show he can be a @entity8 player			2
he simply does not fit the brand of football the manager wants to play and one wonders how this experiment can work			0
@entity4 's heat map shows that the @entity136 striker struggled to impose himself on @entity15 's penalty area where does @entity4 go from here ? taking him off after 45 minutes in a game of this magnitude shows that @entity21 does not trust him and another incident bringing more negative pr , after the player 's failure to applaud the travelling fans in @entity162 , is a headache the manager can surely do without			1
do not believe , however , that @entity4 - who again refused to talk in the mixed zone as he headed for home with @entity14 's shirt stuffed in a clear plastic bag - was the reason @entity8 were flattened			1
he should not be made a scapegoat			0
here ’s why : the six attacking players @entity172 unleashed on @entity8 cost @entity15 £ 271million			0
recruiting the most exciting forwards on the planet does not come cheap but the logic is clear : bringing in those with the gifts of @entity178 , @entity179 enables @entity15 to play a brand of football that almost guarantees goals in the tightest contests			2
yet @entity172 could have spent £ 271 on new signings to score two of the three goals @entity8 shipped to @entity187			0
if @entity4 is giving @entity21 problems up front , his defenders are causing even more concern			0
@entity4 looks on despondent as the @entity8 players trudge back to the centre circle following @entity15 's third the @entity136 forward holds his face in his shirt as he wanders away after @entity15 score their third goal @entity201 laments first - half showing			1

@entity4 substituted at half - time and replaced by @entity205
@entity4 had endured an awful 45 minutes of football against @entity15
the @entity136 had already swapped shirts with @entity15 's @entity14
@entity76 , @entity97 , @entity211 *slammed* @entity4
@entity54 said he was ' lucky to be wearing the shirt ' in the first place
