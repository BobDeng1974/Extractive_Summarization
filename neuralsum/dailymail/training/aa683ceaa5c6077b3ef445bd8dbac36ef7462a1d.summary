by @entity0 @entity1 : 11:23 est , 22 december 2013 @entity2 : 04:53 est , 23 december 2013 researchers believe they have taught a border collie to respond to words in the same way that a human child does border collies are known for their high level of intelligence			2
but @entity11 has proved herself as the undoubted top dog after learning to understand 1,000 words - plus a smattering of @entity16 grammar			1
researchers believe the nine - year - old has learned to respond to words in the same way that a human child does			1
they say @entity11 was able to demonstrate understanding of nouns and verbs			1
one of the team said : ' our findings showed that @entity11 was successful in demonstrating syntax and semantic understanding on 75 per cent of the trials			0
' the study , involving more than seven years of teaching and research on the border collie , was published in the journal @entity35			0
the dog , born in 2004 , lived in the home of the researchers , primarily as a member of the family , but also as a subject for research			2
in the first three years , she learned and remembered 1,022 proper nouns			1
the objects included more than 800 cloth animals , 116 balls , and 100 plastic toys			1
there were no duplicates , and each had unique features so it could be identified			0
each was also given a distinctive name , like ' elephant ' or ' @entity56 '			0
the dog built up and maintained knowledge of the nouns over a 32 - month period			2
each month , she was tested on the entire vocabulary , and each time she was able to identify correctly more than 95 per cent of the objects			0
the researchers say @entity11 's ability to learn and remember so many words , involving discrimination , memory , and other skills , revealed clear evidence of the potential for learning to understand human language			2
the researchers then tried to teach chaser some grammar and investigated her ability to understand the syntax and semantics of sentences consisting of three elements of grammar - a prepositional object , a verb , and a direct object - such as ' to ball take @entity85 ' , and the opposite , ' to frisbee take ball '			1
not only did it require the dog to recognise the 100 toys chosen for the experiment , but she also had to take the right ones to the correct destination			1
researchers from @entity96 in @entity97 , in the @entity94 , concluded that @entity11 was successful in demonstrating syntax and semantic understanding on 18 of the 24 trials , or 75 per cent of the time findings showed that @entity11 was successful in demonstrating syntax and semantic understanding on 18 of the 24 trials , or 75 per cent of the time			1
she could also respond to novel objects			0
researchers from @entity96 in @entity97 , in the @entity94 , concluded : ' after learning the name of the objects , she was able , as are children , to understand the meaning of the sentences even though the objects had never been used in the syntax sentence			1
' the combined findings of the three studies support the conclusion that @entity11 did , indeed , process and retain memories of prepositional and direct objects			0
' the findings closely match the data obtained in dolphin studies involving sentences consisting of three elements of grammar			0
' they said that the experiments revealed that the dog 's understanding of words was not simply confined to memorising strings of words by rote			0
' rather , in some way , her brain is partially constructed like that of humans , ' the researchers said .			0

chaser the dog now able to understand nouns and verbs , researchers say
in first three years she learned and remembered 1,022 proper nouns
the objects included 800 cloth animals , 116 balls , and 100 plastic toys
