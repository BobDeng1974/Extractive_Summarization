traditionally , buying products in bulk was a guarantee of getting more for less			2
but the truth in the modern supermarket could be very different with evidence that everything from cornflakes to coffee may be cheaper in smaller packs			0
a survey of big brands suggests that shoppers need to arm themselves with calculators if they really want to get value for money when touring the aisles			1
a survey of big brands suggests that shoppers need to arm themselves with calculators if they really want to get value for money when touring the aisles for example , @entity22 was offering a double pack of two 350g blocks of popular @entity27 cheddar cheese at £ 6.98			1
but it cost £ 4 to buy two 350g individual blocks			2
a similar pattern was seen with a large 500g jar of @entity33 coffee			0
@entity35 ’s second biggest supermarket was charging £ 11.50 , but it was possible to buy two 300g jars for £ 10 at the supermarket			2
a 1kg box of @entity41 ’s cornflakes was selling for £ 3.38 , but a 750g box was only £ 2			0
the mismatch tends to happen when supermarkets cut the price of small packs for a temporary promotion – or to match reductions at a rival			0

one of the supermarkets assessed was @entity22 but the result is that shoppers can no longer rely on the belief that bigger packs automatically mean they are getting more for less			1
a similar problem was found at @entity65 ’s where , for example , it was selling an 18 pack of @entity68 beer for £ 23 , which works out at £ 1.28 a bottle			1
a 12 pack was £ 13 , which was £ 1.09 a bottle			0
@entity72 , the biggest supermarket chain , was selling a 350g jar of @entity75 ’s tomato and basil sauce at £ 1 , which means two jars adding up to 700g would cost £ 2			1
but one larger 660g jar was £ 2.79			0

but one larger 660g jar was £ 2.79 at @entity94 a 700ml bottle of @entity93 was £ 19.60 , but a 350ml bottle cost £ 9			1
@entity96 , retail expert at analysts @entity98 , said : ‘ it does make you question whether supermarkets take advantage of the vast majority of consumers who assume bulk buying is cheaper			0
’ only last week @entity72 was fined £ 300,000 and ordered to pay £ 65,000 costs at @entity107 after admitting its promotion on punnets of ‘ half - price ’ strawberries costing £ 1.99 was bogus because the original price of £ 3.99 had only applied for a short period			2
but supermarkets are only at risk of breaking the law if they promote a product with a poster or sticker that boasts ‘ @entity120 , @entity121 ’ when this is untrue			0
in the examples in the survey , there were no such claims , which means they were doing nothing illegal			0
@entity127 , executive director at consumer group which ? , said : ‘ when household budgets are squeezed , it ’s unacceptable that shoppers are confused into thinking that they ’re getting a good deal when that might not be the case			0

survey found shoppers are at risk of *losing* out by trusting bulk buy deals
deals at @entity72 , @entity22 , @entity65 *'s* and @entity94 were all *tested*
