by @entity0 , political correspondent cuts : health secretary @entity2 is in talks with @entity5 bosses about how to fill a £ 2bn gap health secretary @entity2 is in talks with @entity5 bosses about how to fill a £ 2billion gap in its funding			1
senior sources say the ageing population , the cost of new drugs and the rising pensions bill for staff has left the health service in @entity16 with the shortfall for next year			1
@entity19 , head of the @entity20 think tank , said there was a ‘ real risk ’ some hospitals could run out of money unless they received a significant cash injection			0
‘ everywhere you look across the @entity5 there are pressures facing patient care , ’ he told the @entity26 , which obtained the £ 2billion figure			2
‘ they ’re having to find even bigger efficiency savings to balance the books and deliver good standards of patient care			0
that ’s a very , very big ask			0
’ the @entity5 budget for @entity16 for 2015 is around £ 100billion			2
@entity39 has not ring - fenced spending on the health service and its budget has risen only by the rate of inflation – without taking into account the rising population and other cost pressures			2
mr @entity39 played down concerns at @entity50 ’s questions yesterday , saying efficiency targets for the @entity5 had been met every year , and the cash ploughed back into frontline care			1
@entity54 of the @entity55 think tank said the health service had been doing well at making savings			0
but she added : ‘ there is a “ pincer ” – as the @entity5 takes on more nurses , drug prices are rising and their pension costs are rising , as part of government policy			2
' we ’re not going to find this money behind the sofa , so it would mean the @entity70 stepping in			0
if it ca n’t do that , we ’re faced with cutting services and cutting quality			0
’ the @entity75 said : ‘ the @entity5 is on track to make £ 20billion savings this parliament and we are confident it will continue to make the savings necessary to meet rising demand			1
’ meanwhile , some @entity83 ministers are understood to be pushing for an increase in the @entity5 budget			0
proposals : gps rejected a move to charge patients for appointments to improve attendance ( file photo ) leader @entity93 is being lobbied by those who think the party should call for more borrowing or spending cuts elsewhere to fund vital health services			1
a source said : ‘ we could differentiate ourselves from the conservatives on something the public really care about for a change			0
’ gps and nurses ’ leaders have suggested charging patients for appointments , in part to save money			1
earlier this year , gps held a vote on charging for appointments at the @entity115 ’s local medical committee conference in @entity116			2
the idea was to deter patients from missing consultations – a problem that costs £ 160million a year			1
the fees – possibly between £ 10 and £ 25 – would be the first since the @entity5 was founded in 1948			1
although the @entity106 rejected the idea , it has not gone away			1
yesterday the @entity126 ’s annual conference in @entity127 debated whether patients should be charged up to £ 10 for seeing their gp			1
nurses who put forward the motion said that @entity5 finances were ‘ not infinite ’			0
once again , the motion was defeated			0
but its very presence on the conference agenda show it is an increasingly live issue .			0

gap *reportedly* caused by ageing patients , costly drugs and rising pensions
yet prime minister played down concerns to the @entity145 yesterday
