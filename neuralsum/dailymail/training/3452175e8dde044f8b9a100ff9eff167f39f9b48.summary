most travellers will be only too aware of how onerous it can be sitting next to a screaming baby at 30,000ft			2
but one passenger ’s ordeal was made a little more bearable after the parents of a 12 - month old baby came up with a cunning plan to placate angry flyers			1
the couple distributed sweets to passengers as a pre-emptive strike in anticipation of the infant causing havoc on board a flight earlier this week			1
the gift bag also included a set of earplugs in case the child , called @entity39 , began crying			1
the passenger , who calls himself @entity41 , posted a picture of the bag online underneath the message : ‘ a baby just handed me this on my flight			1
’ the note read : ‘ @entity49 ! ‘ my name is @entity39			1
i will be 1 on december 17th and this is my first flight			2
‘ i ’ll try to be on my best behaviour , but i ’d like to apologize in advance if i lose my cool , get scared or my ears hurt			2
‘ my mom and dad packed you this goodies bag with a few treats			0
‘ there are also ear plugs in case my first public serenade is n’t as enjoyable to you as it is to my mom and dad			0
‘ have a great flight ! ’ it comes after a similar story in september 2012 when the parents of two 14 - week - old twins distributed sweets to passengers in anticipation of the new - born babies disturbing other flyers it comes after a similar story in september 2012 when the parents of two 14 - week - old twins distributed sweets to passengers in anticipation of the new - born babies disturbing other flyers			1
the innovative approach was again broadcast by @entity82 , who received one of the goodie bags from @entity85 and @entity86			1
' brilliant and thoughtful parents handed these out to everyone on my flight , ' the appreciative traveller wrote on @entity28 at the time , posting a picture of a @entity94 plastic bag filled with goodies and a note of explanation			1
@entity85 and @entity86 handed out gifts to passengers on behalf of their 14 - week - old twins ' we 're twin baby boys on our first flight and we 're only 14 weeks old ! ' the note read			1
‘ we 'll try to be on our best behavior , but we 'd like to apologize in advance just in case we lose our cool , get scared or our ears hurt			0
' our mom and dad ( @entity113 our portable milk machine and our diaper changer ) have ear plugs available if you need them , ' the note added			2
the idea sparked chatter on the social news site , garnering over 3,000 comments and one million views after it was posted online			0
most of the reaction was positive with one user calling it the ' most considerate thing i 've ever seen ... it has fully restored my faith in said consideration			0
' but some thought it was a bit much			0
' really ? you do n't find this to be overkill ? ' one user chimed in			0
' i do n't require an apology for a crying baby on a plane			2
this is to be expected			0
i 'm ok with it			0
people have babies , and they need to travel too , they added .			0
