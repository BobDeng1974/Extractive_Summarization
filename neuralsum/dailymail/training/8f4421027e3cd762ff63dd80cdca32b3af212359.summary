@entity0 certainly is n't the most technically - gifted @entity1 to have played for @entity2			1
there are numerous contenders for that accolade : @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 would all be worthy recipients of that honour			0
@entity0 does n't possess the @entity12 flair of his fellow countrymen			1
no - one can dispute that			0
@entity2 forward @entity0 holds off pressure from @entity17 midfielder @entity16 @entity0 taps home his 11th goal of the seaosn to give @entity2 a 2 - 0 lead at @entity20 on saturday left foot - 34 headers -13 right foot - 3 inside box - 47 outside box - 3 however , his importance to this period of the @entity26 era is just as important than those of his predecessors			1
he notched his 11th of the season against @entity17 - his 50th in total for the @entity33 - on saturday afternoon			1
considering he missed three months of the season with an ankle injury , that 's an impressive return			1
but the goals only tell part of his contribution			0
your archetypal @entity42 no. 9 - the sort of forward @entity2 have n't seen since , perhaps , @entity41			1
you 're unlikely to see @entity0 beat four men on the way to scoring a worldy			1
while he might not be especially technically gifted , @entity0 thrives on the physical side of the game @entity2 's @entity51 forward @entity50 tussles with the @entity17 ' winger @entity52 @entity16 slides in with a strong challenge on the @entity33 ' @entity55 playmaker @entity54 @entity56 bursts forward with the ball as @entity2 's @entity50 ( right ) and @entity58 ( left ) give chase what you will see , though , is @entity0 putting his head where it hurts			1
two minutes into the second half at @entity20 , there he was blocking a @entity52 cross by the right - hand touchline			0
in the 74th minute , he sprinted more than half the length of the pitch to prevent @entity70 from supplying a cross			0
he does that nasty side of the job - not because he has to , but because he wants to			0
supporters love him for it			0
he gets off on it			0
questions marks were raised over @entity0 's place in @entity26 's plans following the summer capture of @entity82			1
the @entity83 international made clear he wanted to occupy @entity2 's central striker role			2
you can only wonder what @entity0 was thinking			2
injured ; knowing his place in the side was under threat			2
@entity2 's anchorman @entity91 holds off @entity16 as the pair tussle in midfield @entity2 striker @entity82 controls the ball ahead of @entity17 midfielder @entity95 what happens on his first match back from injury ? he scores			1
he 's not looked back			0
on saturday , @entity82 played but started on the right ; @entity0 taking centre stage			1
the @entity1 looks to have won his personal duel with the former @entity105 striker			2
indeed , he was left fighting for his @entity33 future last summer after falling out of favour with @entity26 for his highly - publicised flouting of club rules after bringing a woman back to the team hotel the night before a match			0
ask those behind the scenes at @entity2 's @entity115 and they 'll explain once you 've lost @entity26 's backing it 's virtually impossible to get it back			2
@entity0 is the exception to that rule			2
and that 's testament to his temperament and determination			0
the @entity1 clung onto his @entity2 career and refused to let go			1
he may not have the ' je nais sais quoi ' of his countrymen before him - but , for now , he 's @entity26 go to guy			0
@entity58 slides in to tackle @entity56 , but the winger skips over the challenge and heads the ball on following their 2 - 1 win at @entity20 , @entity2 are third in the @entity135 table with 48 points			0

@entity0 has returned from an ankle injury and is in superb form
