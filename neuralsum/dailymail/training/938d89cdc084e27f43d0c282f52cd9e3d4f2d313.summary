by @entity0 , @entity1 former captain @entity2 would not pick @entity3 for this year 's @entity4 and believes the 14 - time major winner will rule himself out of the contest at @entity7			1
@entity2 led the @entity8 to their only victory in the 21st century at @entity11 in 2008 , when @entity3 was ruled out through injury			1
and with the former world number one again struggling for form and fitness , @entity2 does not think current captain @entity16 can afford to use one of his three wild cards on @entity3 on september 2			1
the nine automatic qualifiers are decided on sunday			2
suffering : @entity3 played through the pain at @entity11 but missed the cut by some distance ' i do n't see how you can take an injured player who is not playing well , ' @entity2 told the @entity26			1
' i do n't think i would			2
and also @entity3 has not necessarily been the formula for success either			0
i just do n't see how you can pick him at this point			0
' i am guessing he will call @entity16 and beg out of this and say ' i am not ready ' , make @entity16 's decision easier			0
' the bare statistics make grim reading for @entity3 after the worst year of his career came to an end at the @entity37			1
woods missed the cut for just the fourth time in 66 major championships as a professional at @entity11 , carding consecutive rounds of 74 and suffering more of the back problems which have blighted his campaign			1
the 38 - year - old will not play in next week 's @entity47 and can not qualify for the @entity49 play - offs - missing out for just the second time since the post-season began in 2007 - leaving just the @entity4 to aim for			1
@entity3 has made just seven starts all season , the second fewest in his career , missing three months and the masters and @entity55 after undergoing back surgery on march 31			2
he has recorded no top - 10 finishes for the first time and earned just 108,275 @entity8 dollars ( Â£ 64,543 ) , and while he is not exactly short of money , it should be noted that he has earned more than that in 176 individual @entity63 events in his career			1
pulling out : @entity2 says he expects @entity3 to make @entity16 's decision for him , but choosing not to play but as grim as the statistics are , perhaps what is most telling was the 14 - time major winner 's response when asked when he will play again			1
' i do n't know , ' the 38 - year - old said			2
and asked what he would say if @entity16 calls and asks about the @entity4 , the response was the same : ' i do n't know , he has n't called			0
' whether @entity16 calls at all remains to be seen , with @entity38 far from the only player causing the 64 - year - old some sleepless nights ahead of next month 's contest at @entity7			2
world number six @entity77 , who has already secured his place on the team , pulled out before the start of the @entity8 @entity63 due to back spasms , while defending champion @entity83 lasted just 10 holes before being forced to withdraw with a neck injury			1
@entity83 started the week eighth in the @entity4 standings with the top nine on sunday evening qualifying automatically , but dropped to ninth after @entity90 made the cut at @entity11 and said he was not sure when he would be able to play again			1
@entity92 , who was the only @entity8 player unbeaten at @entity93 in 2012 , was fifth in the standings before declaring himself unavailable as he takes a leave of absence to deal with ' personal challenges '			1
in pain : the 14 - time major champion has been a shadow of his former self as injuries interrupt his game as former @entity104 captain @entity103 said this week , it would be a massive gamble for @entity16 to pick players who are not fully fit , with the prospect of them needing to play five matches in three days at @entity7			1
@entity38 will at least try to get fit as soon as possible , admitting he was too stubborn to withdraw before his second round at @entity11 despite reinjuring himself on the range			0
' i need to get stronger , i need to get my glutes strong again , my abs and my core back to where i used to have them , ' he said			0
' they are just not quite there yet			0
' i could n't make a backswing			0
coming through ( the ball ) is fine , i ca n't get the club back			0
( the injury ) throws everything off			2
i ca n't get anywhere near the positions that i 'm accustomed to getting to			0
i ca n't do it			0
i 've got to rely on timing , hands , and hopefully i can time it just right			2
' it 's hard because you want the bigger muscles controlling the golf swing			0
i have got to rely on my hands to do it			0
the face is rotating so fast through impact because i 'm just not able to get my arms and the body in the correct spot			0

woods missed cut at @entity37 after struggling with injury
@entity2 believes 14 - time major winner will rule himself out
@entity8 missing several stars including @entity92 and @entity83
