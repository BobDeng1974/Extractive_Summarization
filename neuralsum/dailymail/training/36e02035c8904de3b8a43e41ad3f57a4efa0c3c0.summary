by @entity1 reporter published : 12:37 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 12:37 est , 11 january 2013 a @entity3 mother - of - two has taken on an unusual @entity5 's resolution - to eat and drink in @entity6 for the rest of the year			1
from espressos and mochas to the last few eggnog lattes being sold at the coffee chain 's 18,000 stores worldwide , @entity13 ( her legal name ) is planning to eat and drink at @entity6 alone for the whole of 2013			1
' we 're really lucky and i would say actually spoiled as @entity20 because we have all these different eating options , ' she told @entity22			0
extra shot ? beautiful existence , pictured , a mother of two from @entity3 has pledged to only eat @entity6 products for the rest of the year ' you go to all these other countries and they do n't have these luxuries			1
really ? is it really going to be that hard for one year of my life to limit my menu ? we 'll find out			0
' writing on her blog she says she is inspired by the likes of @entity39 and @entity40 - the @entity42 guy - but is frustrated women are n't taking on such food challenges			2
' life is curious … life is unique … life is about asking questions , no matter how small , silly or profound so that you can find out what is true for @entity50 and sometimes see if its true for others as well , ' she writes			0
' so how can eating only one company ’s products impact me , anybody ? well mr. @entity57 ’s already proved that question years ago with his documentary and mr. @entity42 did his take on the loosing [ sic ] weight portion of the food challenges too			0
but when i watched those guys doing their thing i asked myself ' where are the @entity67 challenging themselves in the world ? ''			0
ms @entity70 is a big fan of the chain and says she wants to promote the store			2
' i wanted to help show others what i already knew from family and friend partners ( @entity6 code for staff ) about all the environmental and job - creation / job - benefits and community building this local company does , ' she writes			1
coffee - lover : beautiful existence , pictured left , is going to only consume @entity6 products for the rest of the year			1
she is a big fan of the chain and says she wants to promote the good work it does in @entity3 it is n't the first time she has taken on a year - long endeavor			1
in 2011 she blogged about only buying her belongings in goodwill stores			0
one thing making her challenge slightly less burdensome this time around is she 's allowing herself @entity100 tea and @entity102 products too - given they are owned by @entity6			1
day 1 : fresh orange juice , @entity107 drink , turkey and swiss sandwich , ham and swiss panini day 2 : simply nuts and fruit , @entity114 's quinoa , kale and squash bowl day 3 : southwest scramble and @entity120 's black beans and greens , turkey rustico pannini day 4 : @entity124 rustico panini , roasted tomato and mozzarella panini , latte , banana , garden veggies bistro box , @entity6 caramel macchiato ice cream day 5 : hard boiled eggs , @entity134 chilli chicken wrap , @entity100 tea - ginger infused sugar and @entity6 products are now sold in so many supermarkets she is n't confined to official coffee houses alone			1
she says she is using information on packaging to ensure she gets the nutrition she needs and wo n't put on weight because of the challenge			0
' i ’ve been going in and getting their nutrition by the cup charts for all their serving sizes ' , she told the local news website			0
' i ’m already getting a feel for what to eat — the plain nut pack as a snack because it only has 190 calories , compared to the piece of pumpkin bread			0
' i 'm still trying to figure out how i can do sushi			0
i have two friends who are chefs and i want to see if i can get them to help me tear down some of the products at @entity102 fresh and do something else			0
' aside from the obvious limitations of eating only in a coffee shop the project is also quite expensive			0
despite donations of @entity6 goods from fans of the blog , ms existence is averaging $ 18.79 a day , but even that is n't putting her off			1
chain reaction : @entity6 has been the object of many bloggers interest			1
@entity3 mother @entity177 is a big fan so wo n't be causing any headaches with her challenge to just eat there in 2013 ' the company pays good benefits for part - time workers , ' she explains			1
' that ’s where my money is going			0
' and so far she has only fallen off the wagon once - when baking cakes for her two sons			2
' i will admit to you all right now that i did indeed lick the batter - covered spoon , initially it happened out of bad habit … but it happened , ' she wrote on the blog			2
' i guess you can say that this was my first “ oops ” moment of this year of eating / drinking only @entity6			2
' a @entity202 blogger , @entity201 , is currently undertaking a challenge to visit all 201 @entity6 stores in @entity205			2
last year , @entity206 , 66 , from @entity207 , claimed she lost 85 pounds by going on a @entity6 diet .			1

mother - of - two beautiful existence plans to live on a diet of coffees , panini and other goods sold by the chain
