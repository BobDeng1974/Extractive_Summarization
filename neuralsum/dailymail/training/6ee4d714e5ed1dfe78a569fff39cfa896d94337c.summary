a fleet of kamikaze spacecraft could be used to defend @entity2 against asteroid strikes			2
the robotic vessels would change the direction of any threatening space rock to prevent it from crashing into the planet			2
the prediction came as the @entity9 discussed plans for an international asteroid defence network			1
the plan aims to create an @entity18 so countries can share what they know about asteroids			1
it will also organise groups of scientists ’ from various space agencies to think up ways in which smaller asteroids can be diverted away from @entity2			1
a meteor , or asteroid fragment , that exploded over @entity30 in february injured more than 1,000 people			1
scientists estimate there are a million asteroids big enough to destroy @entity34 , and that an object big enough to threaten civilisation comes along once every few million years			1
the veteran @entity38 astronaut @entity37 advocates defending the planet by using ‘ a fleet of robot spacecraft to slam into the asteroids ’ to deflect them			1
other options include using a ‘ gravity tractor ’ to tow asteroids off course and pummelling them with paintballs			1
the option of blowing them up , as in the @entity52 film @entity51 , is likely to be the last resort			0
but @entity54 , of the @entity55 , said : ‘ the asteroids are there			1
it ’s a question of finding them before they find us			0
’ professor @entity62 , of the @entity63 , said : ‘ it is always good to rehearse these things well in advance			0
’ the worry is specifically on smaller asteroids – those that are more than 450 feet across but smaller than 1 kilometre ( 0.6 miles )			1
more than 1,600 people were injured by the shock wave from the explosion , estimated to be as strong as 20 @entity74 atomic bombs , as it landed near the city of @entity77 @entity38 claims astronomers have detected more than 10,000 asteroids with orbits that could potentially bring them closer , or in contact , with @entity2 since 1995			1
around 9 per cent of these are believed to be around 3,000 feet long , according to reports in the @entity84			0
the most threatening of these , predicted to strike only once every 700,000 to 100 million years , could desolate the planet			0
this impact would be similar to that caused by the asteroid thought to have killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago			0
a 60 - foot asteroid damaged around 4,000 buildings in @entity30 when it exploded over the town of @entity77 earlier this year			0
yet , objects this large are said to only plummet to earth once every 100 years or so			0
rocks around 460ft long , that would have 300 megatons of force , hit every 30,000 years			1
existing telescopes were unable to warn of the @entity77 meteor , which released 440 kilotons of explosive energy and injured more than a thousand people			1
the first that most space agencies heard of the impact was through @entity104 and @entity105			0
‘ because near - @entity2 asteroid searches have focused almost exclusively on large objects with global destructive potential , 99 per cent of the objects big enough to level a major metropolitan area remain undiscovered , ’ the group said in a statement			1
‘ as technology improves and hundreds of thousands of new asteroids are found , the global community will likely be confronted by one posing a worryingly high probability of striking @entity2			1
’ last month the @entity117 and @entity30 signed an agreement to develop technology that could one day lead to weapons being used to destroy asteroids hurtling towards @entity2			2
entitled the ' agreement between the @entity124 and the @entity125 on @entity126 - and @entity127 ' , the document provides the legal framework needed to expand cooperation between @entity117 and @entity30 nuclear research laboratories			0
@entity38 claims astronomers have detected more than 10,000 asteroids with orbits that could potentially bring them closer , or in contact , with @entity2			2
around nine per cent of these are believed to be around 3,000 feet long , according to reports in the @entity84			0
this graphic shows the orbits of all the known @entity139 ( @entity140 ) , numbering over 1,400 as of early 2013			0
these are the asteroids considered hazardous because they are fairly large ( at least 460 feet or 140 meters in size ) , and because they follow orbits that pass close to the @entity2 's orbit the most threatening of these , predicted to strike only once every 700,000 to 100 million years , could desolate the planet - similar to the asteroid believed to have killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago			2
however , as @entity150 from the @entity151 , explains : ' even smaller rocks between 460 and 3,170 feet wide can flatten cities or wreak havoc			0
' the theory has also been used in science fiction films , for example , in the 1998 blockbuster film @entity51 , an asteroid the size of @entity160 threatens earth and a team of astronauts , led by @entity52 , fly towards it and blow it up			0
in the 1998 blockbuster film @entity51 , an asteroid the size of @entity160 threatens earth and a team of astronauts , led by @entity52 , pictured , fly towards it and blow it up two years ago , research physicist and nuclear weapons designer @entity166 , from @entity168 in @entity169 received a discretionary grant for his work into solving how the weapons could be used			2
his work runs parallel to that of the @entity174 , where @entity117 nuclear weapons are designed			2
research scientist @entity177 , from the laboratory , has been studying the effects of detonations on asteroids since 2012 and has simulated explosions using the @entity184 ’s @entity183 supercomputer			2
elsewhere , @entity185 , from @entity186 recently received a million - dollar research grant from @entity38 to discover if an ' impact device or nuclear explosion could deflect an asteroid from its path			0

@entity193 hit in february and injured more than a 1,000 people
@entity197 *proposals* aim to *mitigate* further collisions
they include the creation of an ' @entity18 '
the group , *backed* by the @entity9 , also hopes scientists from around the world will work together on technologies to divert asteroids
