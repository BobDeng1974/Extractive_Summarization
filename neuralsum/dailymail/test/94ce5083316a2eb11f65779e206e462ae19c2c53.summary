love the lighting in these photography shots ? they become even more awe - inspiring at the realisation that they 're paintings , and someone spent between 50 to 300 hours painstakingly creating them			1
@entity7 is a 33 - year - old artist hailing from @entity8 , @entity9 , who specialises in remarkably hyper - realistic paintings			1
in this image , he has painted a falling woman with a deeply intricate background the @entity21 artist specialises in beautifully in - depth oil painted portraits , including this intricate black and white portrait of a man called @entity26 the paintings , including this of a sleeping young girl called @entity29 , take the artist up to 50 to 300 hours to complete it 's almost impossible to tell that @entity7 's flawless creations are in fact oil paintings due to their incredible pin - sharp detail and clarity			1
his portrayals vary between vivid city scenes , still - life objects , portraits and breathtaking motion - shots			0
as well as his portfolio of hyper - realistic paintings , he also constructs more surreal variations on still life , involving insects or inanimate objects in front of a background			2
one of his images is an imitation of the cover art for musician @entity55 's 2013 album , @entity50			0
@entity7 also paints highly - detailed urban shots , which are impossible to tell apart from a photo his technique involves building layers of oil paint in order to achieve the intense level of detail the @entity21 artist works from photos and builds up delicate layers of oil paint on a board or canvas			1
this allows him to add controlled detail and subtle shadowing , which appear almost three - dimensional in the pieces of artwork			0
@entity7 has admitted that an oil painting can take anywhere between 50 to 300 hours ( one to six weeks ) to complete			1
the length of time taken depends entirely on the size of the painting and the level of detail			0
the 33 - year - old artist has admitted that this type of artwork suits his precise preferences and personality			2
@entity7 also constructs more surreal imagery of insects , which all still have the same high level of detail - including ( left ) a dragonfly on an intricate background , and ( right ) @entity7 's painting of a butterfly resting on a wad of letters cracks in the surface : the artist , from @entity9 , specialises in creating exceptionally - realistic works of art. in this case , it is a paintbrush against a background of cracked paint @entity7 said : ' being a perfectionist , i have always been considering art as an outlet for my slightly obsessive personality			1
the artist 's background and education was also important in honing his interests			0
' i studied painting in college , and experimented with hyper realism as a way of perfecting my craft			0
' i never intended to pursue the style , but found it hard to give up , as it suited my nature			0
' @entity7 's artwork - including this painting of half - filled glasses - is astounding in its level of clarity glass half full or half empty ? this painting is incredibly detailed , from the fine fish fins to the bubble floating at the top of the glass @entity7 's paintings can vary between still - life of subjects such as paint - brushes ( left ) and detailed portrayals , such as this harbour ( right ) @entity50 : this painting imitates the album cover art for @entity55 's 2013 album , but swaps @entity55 for a female model			2
