but mr @entity1 soon wished he had never set foot inside after a run - in with the branch ’s ‘ faulty ’ sliding doors left him with a fractured hand			1

’ 85 - year - old @entity1 , from @entity20 fractured his hand after being trapped in sliding doors at @entity7 the incident happened last week , when mr @entity1 visited @entity7 in his home town of @entity20 , @entity25 , to collect some bank envelopes for friends so they could pay in cash			1
as mr @entity1 , 85 , left the bank , he became trapped in the doors and was thrown to the ground			1
his walking frame was badly damaged in the fall and he was later diagnosed with a fractured hand			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ as i came out of the bank , the sliding doors started to close and i assumed the sensor would stop them			2
‘ but they just kept on coming and got faster and then crushed me and literally threw me on to the floor in a heap			2
i went down on my right hand very heavily and the doors broke the handbrake on my wheeled walking frame			1
’ mr @entity1 said customers and staff quickly came to his rescue and he heard a member of staff shout : ‘ turn the doors off – they are not working ’			2
engineers have since been seen working on the doors			0
a taxi was called and mr @entity1 went home where he sat alone in a ‘ state of shock ’ for the rest of the day			2

the branch of @entity7 , @entity20 near @entity62 where 85 - year - old @entity1 fractured his hand in a fall due to being trapped in the sliding doors the injury has left mr @entity1 in plaster up to his elbow for at least six weeks , meaning he will not be able to cook for his neighbour , who suffers from dementia			1
mr @entity1 received just one call from the @entity7 branch four days after the incident – but no apology was forthcoming as he was told ‘ @entity75 footage is being reviewed ’			1
his two daughters , who took up his cause , found they were regularly unable to speak to anyone at the branch , and were routed through an 0845 call centre number			0
at one stage his daughter @entity81 spoke with a ‘ sympathetic young man ’ from the bank ’s complaints department in @entity86 , who said an ‘ area operations manager ’ would contact the family			0
hours later a woman phoned – but again there was again no hint of an apology			0

’ she said : ‘ i was flabbergasted by the comment			0
i wanted to hear the bank apologise to my father			0
it seemed all about denying any corporate responsibility for what had happened			0
‘ i was disgusted by so many aspects of @entity7 simply not dealing with our concerns			2
