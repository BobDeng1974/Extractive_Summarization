but after she lost her daughters in 2006 , they decided to run tests			0
the results were sent to a specialist in @entity44 and @entity5 was diagnosed with an extremely rare condition called @entity46 ( @entity47 ) , which causes clots to form in her body because of a missing enzyme in her blood plasma			1

ms @entity5 with her partner , @entity64 , and baby @entity26			1
doctors had warned her becoming pregnant could kill her but she was desperate for a child ms @entity5 , a teaching assistant and her partner @entity64 , 55 , were stunned when they were told the condition was triggered by pregnancy			1
she said : ' it was a total shock - we did n’t know what the condition was or where it came from			1
no one in my family has ever had a problem			0
' doctors advised me not to get pregnant but i was determined			0
my life was n’t going to be complete without a baby			2
' @entity64 has three children from a previous relationship but i told him right from the start i wanted to be a mum			0
' in september last year , she discovered she was pregnant but lost the baby at seven weeks before doctors could begin treatment for her condition			2
she said : ' after the miscarriages , i started to think maybe i ’d been put on earth to look after other people ’s children and i was n’t meant to have one of my own			2
' i was also aware that i was getting older and the chances of conceiving were less and less			0
' then in january this year , she discovered she was pregnant again			0
her consultant advised her to take aspirin ( known to thin the blood ) and she also had to give herself daily injections in her stomach to prevent clots			2
when she reached 12 weeks , medics were able to start plasmapheresis , which involves removing her plasma and replacing it with donor plasma that contains the enzyme			0
ms @entity5 said : ' i needed an operation to insert a catheter in my chest then i had to go to the hospital and be hooked up to a machine twice a week			2
' it was such a when i made it past 24 weeks as that is the point when i usually miscarry			0
there was n’t a day that went past when i was n’t worried though			0
it was always at the back of my mind			0
' doctors decided to induce her at 37 weeks because it was too risky to keep the baby in the womb any longer			2
she was also given double the amount of plasma the week before the birth			0
@entity26 , who has been hailed a miracle by doctors , was born on october 2 , weighing a healthy 6lb 15oz			2
ms @entity5 underwent daily injections and twice - weekly blood transfusions to prevent her developing blood clots that could kill @entity26 , who was born earlier this month ' until i heard him cry , i refused to believe he was okay , ' said ms @entity5			1
' the care from the hospital has been spot on , i could n’t have asked for better			0
they have gone above and beyond			0
' a lot of people have helped to bring @entity26 into the world			1
he would n’t be here without all those people who donated blood			2
i ca n’t thank them enough			0
' the birth really brought back memories of the babies i ’d lost but we had a happy ending this time instead of a sad one			0
' the condition is genetic so @entity26 may pass it on to his children in the future but he has been given a clean bill of health so far			1
the hospital has now named its two machines after @entity5 and @entity26 in their honour			1
@entity26 , who weighed a6lb 15oz when he was born , has been described by doctors as ' a miracle ' mr @entity64 , a park ranger , said : ' i knew how much @entity5 wanted a baby - she was willing to put life on the line for it and i could n’t have said no. i did n’t think i ’d be changing nappies again at my age but i could n’t be happier			1
' dr @entity173 , consultant haematologist at @entity174 and @entity175 , said : ' only around 100 cases of @entity46 aredescribed worldwide			0
' untreated , it has a mortality rate close to 90 %			0
therefore in the past , @entity5 was advised not to become pregnant again because of the risks to her own life			1
“ however , with time @entity5 decided that she would brave the risks if there was a chance of having a live baby			1
' the hospital is extremely proud to help her achieve her dream - it 's nothing short of a miracle			0
