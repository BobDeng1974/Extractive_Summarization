recovering : @entity0 , the racehorse who was poisoned by crooks days before he was due to run - a crime blamed on illegal gambling syndicates one of @entity7 's most - popular race horses is struggling to regain his strength after he was poisoned by an underground gambling ring			1
the attack on four - year - old stallion @entity12 has shone a light on a criminal underworld where millions of dollars in bets are made under the table			1
the horse 's dramatic plight has underscored the growing brazenness of the well - organised betting rings in @entity7 , who many say threaten to destroy the sport entirely			2
@entity0 had been heavily favoured to win the army day derby until criminals injected him with a near - fatal overdose of cortisone sometime in june - police are n't exactly sure when			1
his trainers say he nearly collapsed and began urinating frequently during a training session four days before the june 22 race			2
he lost almost a fifth of his weight , his black - colored skin broke out in welts and he was diagnosed with temporary diabetes			2
' it was painful to watch , ' said vet @entity39			2
@entity0 is now kept in a dark , cold stable that looks more like a prison with iron bars and proliferation of security cameras to ward off intruders			2
like many of its neighbours , @entity7 has long - suffered lawlessness and violence			0
but the country 's situation has been badly exacerbated by civil divisions caused by the leftist policies of its longstanding socialist government			0
since the death of hugely popular former president @entity58 the country has been riven by unrest , with many middle class areas erupting into open revolt for a time earlier this year			0
despite the country 's massive oil wealth , after nearly 15 years of socialist policies the economy is in recession , there are shortages of basic goods , annual inflation is running above 60 per cent and crime rates are sky high			0
the approval ratings of @entity58 's hand - picked successor , @entity75 , a former bus driver , have plummeted to just 35 per cent			0
but few in @entity7 are willing to return to the situation they faced before @entity58			0
then it was one of the most unequal countries in the world , politically dominated by a mainly white ruling elite and with rates of poverty almost double current levels			0
and many @entity7 are deeply sceptical of the opposition 's democratic credentials after a failed 2002 coup against @entity58 which was backed by the @entity89 nevertheless , the country is very sick			0
authorities have arrested nine people in connection with the poisoning of @entity12 , among them former police officers and a horse owner linked to betting rings			1
but it 's unknown if the investigation , an outcry from top government officials and beefed - up security at @entity103 track in @entity104 can control the rings that some racing officials call ' mafias			1
' gambling on horse races is legal in @entity7 , but the socialist government tightly controls betting at the country 's four racetracks and 1,200 off - track bookies			1
illegal gambling is driven by the government 's limit of 1,000 bolivars on bets , which converts to about $ 10 ( £ 6.20 ) at the black market rate			1
vet @entity39 checks @entity0 at a stable in @entity103 racetrack in @entity104 : the horse was a sensation of @entity7 's horse racing season until criminals injected him with a near - fatal overdose of cortisone last year , the industry in @entity7 handled about $ 120million in legal bets , according to the @entity131 - based @entity130			1
but @entity132 and others who follow the local horse racing industry say the real money is in illegal betting , especially now as @entity7 try to boost the value of their bolivars in the face of 60 per cent inflation and a plunge in the currency 's value on the black market			1
the illegal operations known as ' offices ' can frequently be seen operating in plain view from inside the state - sanctioned gambling halls by so - called ' bankers ' who receive bets in person and by phone			1
@entity7 's state - run @entity153 of @entity154 declined to comment on the illicit operations			0
mr @entity132 , who runs the @entity157 website that tracks race results , estimated that illicit betting rings move between 50 and 60 times the legal market for gambling			1
the state - run horse racing agency says that on any given sunday the government 's take from wagers at @entity103 can surpass $ 3million			0
mr @entity132 said violence has also increasingly encroached on the sport through the kidnapping of and threats against jockeys			0
' illegal betting has existed in every part of the world for a long time , ' he said			2
' but here it was allowed to flourish with so much freedom and impunity			0

stallion @entity12 was injected with a near *lethal* dose of cortisone
he had been heavily *tipped* to win the army day derby in @entity104
illegal gambling is huge because legal bets are restricted to just £ 6.20
