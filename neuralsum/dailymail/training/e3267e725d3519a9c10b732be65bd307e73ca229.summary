comedian @entity0 has been provoked a storm on @entity2 with calls for his show to be cancelled after the official account for his @entity7 show posted an offensive joke			1
the line was taken from a skit about the offensive nature of the name of the @entity13 , but was interpreted as a racist joke poking fun at @entity17 people when taken out of context			1
the ' joke ' was quickly deleted after an online backlash saw the post go viral and the hashtag # @entity23 began trending on @entity2			2
it read : ' i am willing to show # @entity17 community i care by introducing the @entity45 to @entity46			0
' @entity47 , a freelance writer and online activist , was quick to pick up on the post and , believing mr @entity0 himself to be behind the tweet , demanded the show be cancelled			1
she wrote : ' the @entity45 to @entity46 has decide to call for # @entity23			0
' hundreds backed up ms @entity57 's request , accusing @entity0 of being racist and oppressive			0
video from @entity39 's @entity7 defense : @entity0 , pictured on his show with first lady @entity61 , is not the person behind the account that posted the out of context quote apology : the account was forced to post an apology and a disclaimer to say the tweet had nothing to do with @entity0 however , mr @entity0 himself had nothing to do with the post , and later tweeted from his personal account : # @entity23 - i agree ! just saw @ @entity78 tweet			1
who is that , though ? i 'm @ @entity83 ' i share your rage : @entity0 's official @entity2 account distanced itself from the offending tweet shortly after # @entity23 began trending , the tweet was deleted and the account posted a disclaimer which read : ' for the record @ @entity78 is not controlled by @entity0 or his show			1
he is @ @entity91 for the confusion @entity92 '			0
a disclaimer was later posted which read : ' this is a @entity39 account , with no oversight from @entity0 / show			2
' others were outraged over the outrage , posting that the joke had been taken out of context and that the full segment on the show was the complete opposite of racist			2
outrage over the outrage ? some @entity2 users lamented how the furore over the @entity0 tweet was drowning out criticism of the @entity112 ' controversial name @entity114 @entity113 wrote : ' # @entity23 is what happens when people confuse real racism with context - sensitive humor			1
' @entity119 added : ' finally looked into # @entity23 - do n't make fun of racism or you 'll be called a racist apparently			0
' others hit back at @entity124 , and began using the anti- ' @entity126 ' hashtag # cancelsueypark .			0
