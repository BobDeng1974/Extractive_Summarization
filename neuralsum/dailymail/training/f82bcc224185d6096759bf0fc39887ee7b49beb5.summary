@entity0 has backed @entity1 to take this summer ’s @entity2 by storm – but warned the @entity5 striker this is his last chance to shine			1
the @entity8 star has failed to score in the last two tournaments but will lead the line for @entity12 ’s side in @entity13			2
@entity0 , who tried to sign @entity1 for @entity14 last summer , believes the 28 - year - old will cope with having the weight of a nation ’s expectations on his @entity19 : scroll down for @entity1 : this is the one where i have to show what i can do @entity25 : @entity1 can set the @entity2 alight , according to @entity0 in training : the forward is currently at @entity5 's base in @entity29 as he gears up for the @entity2 staycation : @entity0 was at @entity31 on sunday night , managing the @entity32 at soccer aid ‘ he is not a kid anymore , he is not an old player at the end of his career , he is in what i call the best age , ’ he told @entity34			1
‘ i think it is his @entity2 and i think he has also a role as a leader in the team , a little bit similar that he had also in @entity8 this season			1
‘ he is a guy with responsibilities in the national team , i think he is ready to cope with this pressure			0
‘ i think that can play a positive role in his ambition , in his anger to succeed			0
i have faith in him , i have faith that he can do it			0
’ @entity0 also admitted he has no idea how @entity5 will perform in @entity13 , given their unpredictable nature			1
@entity12 ’s men reached the quarter - finals at @entity65 before losing to @entity66 on penalties			0
they will renew hostilities with @entity70 ’s men on saturday in @entity71			0
’ @entity5 is the kind of team where i am always expecting something good but i am never surprised when things go wrong , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ when people speak sometimes about not enough quality in the team i always disagree and i remember for example the @entity5 team in 2004 , it was the @entity82 in @entity83 which is the year where i come to @entity5 for the first time			2
‘ even in that time people were already saying that the team was not good enough to win the competition and i remember the @entity5 team in 2004 , i remember lots of them , it was full of top players from the top teams in the country			2
past struggles : @entity1 as been out of form and fitness at his past two @entity2 appearances senior : he currently stands on 39 goals in 91 caps for his country smiles : a tally he will be desperate to add to in his next game against @entity66 on saturday ‘ you go now and obviously you have some boys who are not playing in the top teams in the country but you have players from @entity14 , from @entity8 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , so the top five all represented in high numbers in the national team so you have quality , you have experience , you have international experience , you have everything so why not be a candidate ? ‘ if @entity5 wins the @entity2 for me it is only a surprise because you won only once and you won when i was three years old so only because of that i would say , oh that ’s a surprise but because of the players and the experience and the stature that almost all of them have , it would n’t be a surprise but at the same time , if they do n’t go through the group phase it is not a surprise either to me			1
’ when asked who he thinks will win the @entity2 , @entity0 said he believes the trophy will not be won for the first time			1
fan club : @entity0 signs autographs for spectators at @entity139 trespasser : he also ran onto the pitch in the first half to trip up @entity143 from behind ‘ i will be very surprised if there is a big surprise , ’ he said			2
‘ i will be very surprised if somebody is going to win the @entity2 for the first time			2
‘ i do n’t see a national team with conditions to do that , to break what used to say the stability			0
in @entity153 , the @entity153 think they are going to be strong and they have two or three strong teams			0
‘ i do n't think the @entity155 , despite fantastic players and much more experience as a team , i do n't think they can break the quarter final wall			0
in @entity161 you have always the traditional two or three , maybe in @entity161 could come some outsider but i do n’t see there will be any big surprise			0
