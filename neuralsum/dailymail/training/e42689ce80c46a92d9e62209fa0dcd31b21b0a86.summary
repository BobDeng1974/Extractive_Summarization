only half of @entity2 citizens pay federal income tax , according to the latest available figures			1
in 2009 , just 50.5 per cent of @entity2 paid any income tax to the federal government - the lowest proportion in at least half a century			1
and the number of people outside the tax system could have climbed even higher since as the economic downturn has continued to bite and unemployment has remained high			2
figures : this graph from the @entity15 shows that half the population of the @entity2 pays no federal income tax at all the decreasing number of taxpayers threatens government revenues , and could also cause resentment from those who believe that welfare recipients are taking money out of the economy			1
151.7million @entity2 citizens paid no federal income tax in 2009 , according to figures compiled by the @entity15 , a right - wing think tank			1
in 1984 , the middle of the @entity29 era , 85 per cent of @entity2 paid federal income tax , meaning just 34.8million people did not			1
the figures include children , the retired and others who do not participate in the labour force			0
nonetheless , they largely reflect the sudden jump in the unemployment rate after the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession			0
unemployment rose from around five per cent at the beginning of 2008 to a high of 10 per cent in october 2009			0
crisis : unemployment has declined slowly under @entity45 as well the increased number of jobless people , the reduction in the number of taxpayers is a result of low - income workers taking pay cuts and reduced hours , and therefore slipping out of the tax system			2
it also includes people who illegally fail to file a tax return even though they might have earned enough money to do so			0
another finding by the @entity15 shows that 21.8 per cent of @entity2 citizens receive financial assistance from the federal government			2
this means that 67.3million people - a record high - are ' dependent on the federal government ' , excluding government employees who rely on the public sector for their salaries			1
the conjunction of fewer taxpayers with higher welfare payments has led to intense pressure on the public purse , with the national deficit running at $ 1.3trillion per year			0
the @entity15 argues that the reduction in the number of taxpayers will create an electorate dominated by non-taxpayers , who will always support higher taxes and spending because their own money is not at stake .			0
