' i said what i understood and i said what i was able to say , ' he explained			0
' from seven years old , from day one of the abuse , @entity4 told me that we loved each other and this was love , this was an expression of our love			2
and then he would follow it up with ' but if you ever tell anyone what we are doing both of our lives and careers would be over '			0
' ' this is not a case of repressed memory			0
i have never forgotten one moment of what @entity4 did to me , but i was psychologically and emotionally completely unable and unwilling to understand that it was sexual abuse			2
' he said having his own child two years ago made him face up to the truth , as he said he could n't help thinking about how he 'd feel if a stranger molested his little boy			2
' i 'm a father and i became a father two and a half years ago to this beautiful baby boy and during the first 18 months of his life i collapsed into two nervous breakdowns , terrifying nervous breakdowns , ' he said			0
evidence : @entity4 's case was backed by @entity11 at the star 's 2005 trial , pictured entering court , over molestation claims idol : @entity11 , pictured as a young boy , was supported by @entity4 who had him appear in numerous videos ' at that point , i had no idea what was going on			1

' he has asked a probate court to allow him to file a late creditor 's claim against @entity4 's estate , even though the deadline has passed for creditors to file such claims			1
the estate 's lawyer , @entity211 , has dismissed @entity11 's claims			1
in a statement @entity211 said : ' this is a young man who has testified at least twice under oath over the past 20 years and said in numerous interviews that @entity4 never did anything inappropriate to him or with him			2
' now , nearly four years after @entity4 has passed , this sad and less - than - credible claim has been made			2
@entity11 said the ordeal of launching such a public case was too great for it to be about money			0
' the idea that i would make all of this up and put myself , my wife , my son , my entire family through this extremely stressful and painful experience all for money is incomprehensible , ' he said			0
' i 've lived in silence and denial for 22 years and i ca n't spend another moment in that ... i 'm never going to go away with this for the sake of money			0
i 'm never going to be silenced for money			0
that 's not going to happen			0
' @entity11 's lawsuit comes as the high profile trial of @entity4 's tour promoter , @entity243 , continues			1
the trial is brought by the singer 's mother and children who claim @entity243 shares blame in his death for neglecting to vet and supervise @entity4 's doctor , dr @entity251			2
then @entity11 , who was then 22 , testified in the @entity253 courtroom that he was five when he met @entity4 for the first time in his hometown , @entity256 , @entity12			1
two years later , he was a guest at @entity4 's neverland ranch for the first of some 20 - plus overnight visits			2

when asked by @entity4 's lead lawyer , @entity269 , whether he 'd ever been molested by the singer @entity11 replied : ' absolutely not , ' before also denying strongly that @entity4 had ever touched him in a sexually explicit way			1
when senior deputy district attorney , @entity272 , questioned @entity11 's account , he replied : ' i 'm telling you , nothing ever happened			1
' @entity272 then said , according to a @entity278 article at the time : ' you 're saying nothing ever happened when you were awake , ' to which @entity11 responded : ' i think something like that would wake me up			0
' however , a former maid at @entity264 who testified at the trial as a witness for the prosecution , said she had seen @entity4 groping @entity11 in the shower at the ranch			1
but @entity11 denied ever having a shower with the star			1
now but now @entity11 is claiming @entity4 did in fact molest him , over a period of seven years			1
in an interview with today , @entity11 , now 30 , labelled @entity4 ' a pedophile and a child sexual abuser ' who from the ages of seven to around 14 ' performed sexual acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him			2
' he said that @entity4 told him the alleged abuse was ' an expression of our love			0
' @entity11 added , explaining why he gave what he claims now was a false testimony : ' this is not a case of repressed memory			0
i have never forgotten one moment of what @entity4 did to me , but i was psychologically and emotionally completely unable and unwilling to understand that it was sexual abuse			0
' but he said he was never offered money to deny the abuse during the trial			0
' there was no money , there was no " you must lie			0
" @entity4 , when he would talk to me before these things were going on , and he would call me everyday ... it was complete manipulation and brainwashing			0
it was n't any sense of the truth on the phone , he would role play with me and train me for these scenarios			0
