@entity0 moved to within one goal of @entity4 's @entity3 scoring record with his opening strike against @entity6 on wednesday night			1
the @entity8 star had failed to score at @entity9 in all of his previous five visits , but made no mistake with a neat half - volley in the 23rd minute			1
it took @entity0 's @entity15 tally to 70 goals , one off that of @entity18 favourite @entity4 but just one ahead of @entity20 rival @entity19			1
@entity4 ( @entity18 , @entity33 ) 71 goals 2			2
@entity0 ( @entity35 , @entity18 ) 70 3			1
@entity19 ( @entity20 ) 69 4			0
@entity37 ( @entity36 , @entity35 , @entity18 ) 56 5			2
@entity38 ( @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 ) 50 ' i ’m going to beat his record , whether now or another night , ' said @entity0			2
' @entity19 is very close too			0
it ’s a team win , we have nine points so 75 per cent of the qualification is done			0
' @entity18 's 3 - 0 @entity49 victory was the @entity52 side 's eighth win on the spin , with @entity0 scoring in every game since @entity55 kicked off in late august			1
the 29 - year - old was applauded by some sections of the home support when he was substituted in the 75th minute ; with even the @entity9 faithful prepared to recognise his remarkable feats			1
' it was special , ' said @entity0			0
' it was my first goal at @entity9 and i feel very happy			2
we knew before the game that @entity9 is a difficult place , but we played fantastic football – especially in the first half , and we deserved it			0
’ meanwhile , in the @entity70 , @entity6 continue to stumble @entity71			0
they have dropped 11 points already this season and recent victories over @entity75 and @entity76 were not without their scares			0
some supporters were pointing to @entity0 ’s record against them as reason for optimism , following his previous scoring drought at @entity9			1
but now his sights are trained on a different record			0
@entity85 's @entity18 have won their last seven matches on the spin in @entity52 and in @entity15 @entity0 had never scored at @entity9 - he is pictured here celebrating @entity89 's winner in 2007 @entity0 is just one behind @entity4 's @entity3 goalscoring record			1

@entity18 beat @entity6 3 - 0 in @entity3 tie at @entity9
@entity94 opened the scoring with his 23rd - minute strike
the @entity8 star is now just one *shy* of @entity4 's scoring record
it also marked @entity0 's first goal at @entity9 in six *attempts*
some @entity6 fans applauded @entity0 when he was substituted
