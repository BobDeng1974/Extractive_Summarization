former @entity1 mayor @entity0 is coming out swinging on behalf of both @entity2 and president @entity3 , insisting that neither should be second - guessed on their foreign policy records			0
the nanny - state pol , now a registered independent after years in both the @entity6 and @entity8 parties , said @entity10 likely did all she could about the situation in @entity12 that led to the deaths of the @entity15 ambassador and three other @entity15			1
' i think most of the criticisms of @entity2 are totally unfounded – you can maybe disagree with her policies , but what 'd you expect her to do in @entity22 ? ' he said in a recent interview			0
@entity26 's backing comes as a new @entity28 committee is set to focus intensely on the @entity10 - led @entity30 's failure to protect its @entity22 diplomatic compound in the months before armed terrorists laid waste to it , a congressional source told @entity34 on monday			1
former @entity1 mayor @entity0 is backing @entity2 in her political life - or - death struggle with @entity28 @entity36 over the deadly 2012 @entity22 , @entity12 terror attack the @entity15 diplomatic outpost in @entity22 erupted in flames during a terror attack by armed militants on september 11 , 2012 , just months after @entity43 - linked groups rallied in the city with dozens of military vehicles @entity2 ( c ) attended daughter @entity48 's graduate school commencement at @entity49 on saturday , while a maelstrom of accusations awaits the former secretary of state upon her return ' i mean , it 's that kind of cheap politics which i do n’t like			1
she ’s very competent , ' @entity0 told @entity57 of @entity36 ' tactics to date			0
@entity10 has come under fire from @entity36 for initially blaming the september 11 , 2012 terror attack in the eastern @entity12 port city on a spontaneous protest allegedly sparked by a crude anti-muslim video			1
her statements immediately after the attack , and just weeks before @entity3 's re-election , were later proven false when intelligence reports and internal @entity28 emails made it clear that the administration knew immediately that an @entity43 - linked @entity73 terror group was responsible			1
but amid @entity6 ' zeal to paint @entity10 as a serial fabricator in advance of her decision on whether to run for president , they have asked few questions publicly about @entity30 policies and decisions before the attack took place			1
a 2014 @entity87 report concluded that the @entity22 terror strike was ' likely preventable ' because @entity30 knew about security lapses and received several prior warnings about a deteriorating situation there			1
and evidence emerged in november that an @entity43 affiliate held a 2012 rally , parade and press conference in central @entity22 months before the 9/11 attack that year , and that the @entity30 was notified			1
at the event , terror leaders warned that ' assassinations ' would follow			0
that same group , @entity102 , led the september attack that killed four			2
in the five months before the deadly attack , the @entity15 facility that would later fall was assaulted twice by armed militants			2
on april 6 , 2012 , two former security guards there threw ieds over a fence at the compound			0
and on june 6 of that year terrorists detonated an explosive at the main perimeter gate , blowing a hole in it that a whistle - blower later told @entity117 was ' big enough for forty men to go through			0
' @entity6 ' strategy is set to change with the seating of a new select committee in the @entity122 charged solely with investigating the terror attack			2
' believe me , the committee will be less concerned with how the administration spun what happened than with why it happened in the first place , ' an aide to a @entity36 member of that committee told @entity34 on monday			2
@entity102 openly holds rallies , marches and news conferences in the @entity135 , often boasting that they hold power in cities where police presences are nonexistent and government control is weak @entity102 , the group behind the @entity22 attack , frequently holds rallies in @entity144 like this one in @entity145			2
the @entity30 knew a similar event happened in @entity22 in june 2012 but did nothing to beef up security @entity150 gop rep. @entity149 ( c ) is chairing a new @entity28 panel on @entity22 , a committee that expects to focus intensely on why the @entity30 ignored warnings about the deteriorating security situation at its diplomatic post in @entity22 the aide requested anonymity since he is not authorized to speak publicly about the committee 's plans			1
that posture will likely dredge up the less - incendiary questions about why the @entity10 - led @entity30 denied multiple requests for added security forces at the @entity15 diplomatic post in @entity22 , and at a nearby @entity166 annex facility			1
@entity10 addressed the @entity36 's investigative forward motion last week , telling a @entity1 audience that ' i do not believe there is any reason for it to continue in this way , but they get to call the shots in the @entity117			1
' on @entity174 , committee chair rep. @entity149 suggested @entity10 was derelict for not pulling diplomats out of @entity22 after every other @entity177 nation had done so			0
' why were we still in @entity22 ? ' he asked			0
' the @entity180 ambassador was almost assassinated			0
our facility was attacked twice			0
there were multiple episodes of violence			0
we were the last flag flying in @entity22 and i would like to know why			0

the former mayor accused @entity28 @entity36 of ' cheap politics ' for questioning @entity10 's actions before and after the 2012 terror attack
an aide to a member of the new @entity195 on @entity22 says it will probe @entity10 's failure to heed security warnings before the attack
the focus on the former secretary of state comes as she is the @entity8 ' *undeniable* presidential front - runner
the @entity30 had *numerous* warnings , *including* *knowledge* of a terrorist rally and parade in @entity22 months before the attack
the group that led the assault on the @entity15 diplomatic compound and killed the @entity15 ambassador also warned of ' assassinations ' to come
