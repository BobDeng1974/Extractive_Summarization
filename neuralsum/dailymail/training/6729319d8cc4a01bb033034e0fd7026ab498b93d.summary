the contentious measures , which threaten to change the face of rural @entity7 forever , have proved ‘ catastrophic for the countryside ’ , says a damning new report			1
planning permission had been given for a staggering 27,000 houses on greenfield sites against the wishes of local authorities in the last two years alone , it found			1
under the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) , introduced by the @entity29 in march 2012 , council chiefs were instructed to ‘ significantly boost housing supply ’ in a bid to tackle the property crisis gripping the @entity33			2
local authorities were ordered to identify a five - year supply of land to meet demand for new properties in their area			0
@entity33 is facing a housing shortage because not enough new homes have been built by successive governments to cope with the @entity33 ’s rapidly increasing population , much of it fuelled by immigration			1
huge competition for homes that do come on the market has created a housing bubble in @entity49 and the south - east , inflating prices and locking hard - working families out of the property market			2

‘ the government should remove the automatic presumption for development where there is no five - year land supply			0
‘ councils must be provided with detailed guidance on housing targets , and brownfield land must be prioritised so that unnecessary greenfield development is not so blatantly and regularly allowed through the back door			0
