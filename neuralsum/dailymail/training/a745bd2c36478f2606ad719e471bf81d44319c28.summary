so anyone going to see @entity6 ( 2hrs 38mins ) , @entity7 ( 2hrs 30mins ) or @entity8 ( 2hrs 46mins ) will love this app. @entity10 , which is available on @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity14 phones , tells you the best times to dash to the loo without missing any key scenes			1
do n't you hate when needing the loo interrupts a good movie ? or when you leave to go to the bathroom and accidentally miss the best scene ? thanks to @entity10 , you can safely miss the queues for the loo at the beginning of the movie , and just nip out during a dull bit the staff behind the app make a note of any three - to - five minute slots when the film starts to drag a bit			2
helpfully , the app then gives you a synopsis of what happened while you were away			0
films up to 90 minutes get one break , but for longer movies the app offers two or three possible slots			0
it costs 69p from @entity44			1
never suffer with your legs knotted together in a film again thanks to the magic of @entity10			2

available on @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity14 phones
