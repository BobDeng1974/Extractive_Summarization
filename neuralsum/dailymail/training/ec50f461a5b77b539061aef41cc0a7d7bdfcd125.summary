a rhino was butchered for its single horn and left to die in a pool of it 's own blood , in the @entity5 in @entity6			1
forestry workers discovered the dead animal 's lifeless body in the @entity11 range in the north - eastern @entity13 state			1
illegal rhinoceros horn poaching is one of the major environmental issues in the park , with animal body parts such as the toenails and skin having a high value on the @entity24 medicinal market			1
the mammal is mostly found in the @entity13 state and in protected areas of @entity48			2
the one - horned rhino once ranged throughout the @entity50 , but their numbers were greatly reduced by hunting			1
however , more than 3,000 are still thought to live in the wild , of which more than 2,500 are believed to be in @entity13 alone			0
there are five different species of rhinoceros , and all are threatened to some degree			2
although poaching drastically reduced their numbers in the 1900s , numbers have steadily increased in recent years			0
meanwhile , an experiment hoped to produce a rhino calf by relocating three endangered rhinos from a @entity67 to @entity68 , has all but failed			2
@entity69 pats female northern white rhino @entity70 in her pen where she is being kept for observation at the @entity73 in @entity74 ; the keepers of three of the last six northern white rhinos in existence have said the mammals will never produce a calf naturally and that they are now relying on in vitro fertilisation to produce a calf and save the species from extinction the keepers of three northern white rhinos in kenya - half of the world 's remaining rhinos of that species - have said for the first time that their one male and two female rhinos will certainly not reproduce naturally			1
this means the species may be doomed to extinction			0
however , it is hoped science can play a part and save the species			0
scientists will try and use in vitro fertilisation , and work with the rhinos ' genetic material , in a budding field known as de-extinction			0
the conservancy said in a statement todaythat artificial reproductive techniques ' could provide the last chance of survival for the world 's most endangered mammal			0

the @entity5 in @entity6 is a hunting ground for poachers
animals there are butchered for their toenails , skin and horns
the one - horned rhino is a vulnerable species and is mostly found in @entity6
