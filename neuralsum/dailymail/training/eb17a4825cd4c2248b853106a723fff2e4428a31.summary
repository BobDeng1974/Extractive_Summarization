by @entity0 it was with tears in my eyes that i read about the horrific cases of abuse and neglect in the @entity9 report			1
much of the coverage has focused on how men of mostly @entity13 descent preyed on vulnerable young white victims			1
the details of this abuse are awful			2
but what has largely been ignored is the report 's finding that sexual abuse has been systemically under - reported among @entity13 girls due to entrenched cultural taboos - obscuring the reality that there is a similarly rampant problem of minority girls being abused by members of their own community			1
i have first - hand knowledge of this problem			1
i 'm coming forward to publicly share my own story in the hope that i can encourage others to do the same and help tear down the wall of silence that perpetuates further abuse			2
when i was ten , a neighbour started sexually abusing me			1
paralysed by shame , i said nothing			0
at 18 , i was fortunate enough to receive an offer to study at @entity48			0
i was enthralled with the exciting new world around me and tried desperately to fit in			0
i replaced my traditional shalwar kameez with jeans			0
i bared my shoulders and cut my hair			0
i socialised more than i studied and became president of the @entity55			0
an internship at @entity57 led to a job in private equity in @entity60 , and after a few years i got an mba from @entity62			2
but all the while , i knew the girls i had grown up with did n't have the same opportunities - and that my abuser was probably still preying on other children			1
it was only after a decade away from @entity40 that i was finally able to garner the courage to return and testify against my abuser			1
when i first told my mother about the abuse , she was devastated			1
the root of her anger was clear : i was heaping shame on to my family by trying to bring the perpetrator to justice			0
in trying to stop him from exploiting more children , i was ensuring my parents and my siblings would be ostracised			2
she begged me not to go to the police			2
if i 'd still been living in @entity40 , surrounded by a community who would either blame me for the abuse or label me a liar , i 'm not sure i could have rejected her demands			1
it was only after a decade away from @entity40 that ms @entity0 was able to garner the courage to return once the police began the investigation , another victim came forward			1
@entity95 described how he too had been abused almost 20 years before i was			2
due to our combined testimony , the perpetrator was jailed for eight years			2
within a few weeks another young woman in the community , emboldened by the conviction , told the police that a relative had raped her for several years			1
it had started before @entity105 was in her teens			0
we have supported her through the process of taking this to court			0
although @entity95 and i had removed a proven paedophile from the community and helped empower another woman to end her torture , we were not celebrated			2
on the contrary , we were shunned			2
the @entity9 report cites a home affairs select committee finding that cases of @entity13 men grooming @entity13 girls did not come to light in @entity9 because victims ' are often alienated and ostracised by their own families and by the whole community , if they go public with allegations of abuse '			1
this was our experience - and the experience of everyone i 've since spoken to			2
it became clear that for three decades many other women had suffered at the hands of our abuser , but they had refused to testify because of the stigma			2
i learned that the parents of at least one victim had known their child had been abused but had done nothing			2
we discovered the larger community had long been aware of rumours of abuse by my neighbour but had ignored them - even when @entity95 had attempted to come forward several years earlier			1
this refusal to condemn perpetrators persists even after their conviction			0
soon after our case , another convicted sex offender was released back into our community and was accepted as if nothing had happened			1
it was clear that the same would happen with our abuser			0
much has been made about the religion of the offenders in the @entity9 report			1
but this problem is n't about religion or race : it 's about a culture where notions of shame result in the blaming of victims rather than perpetrators			2
although painful to read , the @entity9 report presents an opportunity for leaders in the @entity43 - @entity42 community to speak out about the sexual and physical abuse in their midst			1
the @entity13 community is n't unique in having evildoers , and the overwhelming majority of its men and women are good people who care about protecting others			1
i always will be proud of my @entity42 heritage , but i firmly believe community leaders must take responsibility for the fact that the taboos that prevent others from identifying perpetrators and supporting victims enable further abuse			1
and those taboos must be challenged			0
the report also presents an opportunity to overhaul the public institutions that have failed to protect the defenceless - which includes everyone from the police to schools to social services			1
on multiple occasions , beginning when she was 12 , @entity105 went to her gp and to walk - in clinics wearing her hijab to get the morning - after pill			2
she was never asked if she needed help			2
when she approached the police the @entity201 initially told her it would not pursue the case because there was too little evidence			0
it 's a testament to her resolve that she pushed back , demanding a chance to seek justice			0
the system failed her , just as it has thousands of other children of all backgrounds			0
we now have the chance to change that , and there are four immediate steps we should take to address this problem			0
first , we need better training of social workers and police to identify victims			1
the @entity9 report cited that one reason for the under - reporting of abuse among minority communities was officials ' focus on communicating with male leaders , who ignored the problem			1
women and girls need including in these conversations , and officials must broaden the scope of their inquiries			0
second , we need mandatory reporting by people of authority when they see signs of potential abuse			1
one of the most damning parts of the @entity9 report was that teachers were discouraged from reporting potential cases			1
for @entity105 , mandatory reporting by doctors could have saved years of abuse			1
third , we need improved support for victims when they come forward			0
@entity105 's case has been drawn out for far longer than expected , during which time she has faced pressure to withdraw her testimony			0
she has struggled to get the help she needs to overcome her trauma			0
we need a judicial process that recognises the cost of delayed prosecutions for victims and better counselling services			0
the @entity260 , published last month , estimates that 1,400 children were abused in @entity9 , pictured , over a 16 - year period fourth , we need a single person in each community accountable for ensuring these and other relevant policies are implemented			1
there are a lot of people with partial responsibility , but for this to be an effective , coordinated , comprehensive response , we need one individual who takes full responsibility for ensuring child sex exploitation is addressed and who can be held accountable for real change			0
some of these policies are being implemented			0
but they are not being implemented everywhere , and they are not being implemented quickly enough			0
the biggest risk is that once the shock of this report dissipates , it will get swept under the rug , just like three previous reports in @entity9			1
we can not let that happen			0
we do n't need any further reports : we need system - wide change in the way we approach fighting sexual abuse against children of all backgrounds			1
this is not a problem in @entity9 , @entity293 or @entity294			1
this is a problem in the @entity43			1
and we need to tackle it together			0
in the words of @entity298 , ' the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good [ people ] to do nothing			0
' let 's not be those people			0
some names have been changed to protect anonymity			0
@entity0 is co-founder and ceo of @entity309 , the one - stop shop to discover and book activities			1
she previously worked at @entity312 , @entity313 and @entity57			0
she has an mba from @entity62 , where she was a @entity315 scholar , and a @entity316 from @entity293 where she was president of the @entity55 .			0

@entity0 was abused by her neighbour in @entity40 from age of 10
ten years on , she wanted to report abuse but her mother begged her not to
man was convicted - but she and other victims were shunned by community
ms @entity0 says better training is needed for social workers to spot abuse
also wants mandatory reporting by officials of any *suspected* *mistreatment*
report released last month estimates 1,400 children abused in @entity9
children *trafficked* , beaten and raped at hands of @entity13 men for 16 years
ms @entity0 : ' this is not a problem in @entity9 . this is a problem in the @entity43 '
