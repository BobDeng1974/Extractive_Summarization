@entity0 is on a mission			0
earlier this year , the star came under attack for claiming that women should put off careers and focus on having children in their twenties , because it 's much harder to get pregnant later on			2
but the mother - of - two is undeterred and yesterday evening at special talk in @entity11 she was once again warning @entity13 ladies about the perils of leaving it until your late thirties to start a family			2
she said : ' the facts can not be got away from			0
you have a 10 per cent chance of conceiving a child over 40			1
i do n't say this smugly - i got in just under the wire			2
' i think women are being lied to			2
' it gets more and more difficult to have children over the age of 35			0
' plenty of women do n't want children , that 's fine - but if you do , you need to know the facts			1
the tv presenter is suggesting that girls delay university and careers and have their children first the @entity47 presenter was talking about the perils of late motherhood as part of a stylist magazine @entity52 talk in @entity11 yesterday			1
@entity0 advised women to think seriously about delaying university until after their children are born			2
she said : ' i want to say to women : be honest with each other , with your partners , daughters and sons - know that you can have careers at any age , you can go to uni at any age			1
' you can do a thousand brilliant things at any age			0
but just for now , we have n't opened the fertility window any wider			0
' it is easier and simpler and less of a heartache to just have children when our bodies allow us to			0
' nature is not a feminist and that 's just the truth			0
' although @entity0 's comments on fertility were heavily criticised by certain feminist corners when she first made them this year , the star is n't alone in her opinions			0
her views are backed up by the latest research figures from the @entity83 and @entity84 , which show that the average woman aged 30 only has 12 per cent of her eggs left , while a woman turning forty has only three per cent left in her reserves			1
on top of that , data from the @entity90 and @entity91 shows @entity94 had a global failure rate of 77 per cent in 2012			1
@entity94 can put an immense pressure on a relationship , with the procedure tripling the likelihood of divorce ( picture posed by models ) @entity103 is the founder of @entity104 , a support network for childless women in the @entity13 who believes too many older women think @entity94 will come to their rescue			1
@entity103 started trying for a baby with her husband aged 29 , but the marriage broke down in her late - thirties			1
she hoped to meet a new partner and try ivf but a suitable relationship did not materialise			0
at the age of 43 she found herself single again and had to begin the process of grieving and accepting her childlessness			2
now she has built a community of women who share her situation			2
she runs workshops and retreats in @entity11 and @entity125 helping women who are also making the transition to a life without the family they hoped for			2
@entity103 predicts that the country is sitting on a ticking time bomb of women who are delaying pregnancy until it 's too late			2
she said : ' @entity137 infertility is the biggest thing for the next generation			0
' in one generation , the worst social stereotype has gone from being a single mother to a woman over 40 without children			2
' we see people conceiving in their forties , but they 're extremely lucky , it 's this mythical age			0
@entity103 is the founder of @entity104 , a support network for childless women in the @entity13 ' in one generation we 've had access to all of these things that give freedom to women ; access to abortion , access to higher education , access to professions and legal access to birth control			2
' but fertility is not a feminist , it is focused on us having children when we 're young			0
' the problem does n't just lie with delaying pregnancy though , it is also our belief that @entity94 is going to be the solution			1
much is written about the difficulty of going through in vitro fertilization , but @entity103 feels there is n't enough discussed with potential patients about how low the chances of success really are			2
she said : ' most of us get an education from the miracle stories - there is very little awareness that globally 77 per cent of @entity94 has failed			1
' most women who are struggling to conceive do n't know that there is a five per cent success rate for women aged 43 - 44 , that becomes under two per cent success for women 44 and over			1
artificial insemination of a human female egg - the process has a 77 per cent global failure rate at @entity103 's @entity192 community , thousands of women come together for support			1
she said : ' if you 're childless and a single woman , it 's shameful , it 's like you 're not a real woman , it 's like you 've failed			0
' whenever i 'm in the media , there 's a huge response , it shows people have been reached			0
' i 'm doing it so there is a resource there that was n't there when i needed it			0
' i 'm just one individual but i 'm looking after so many women , because there is so little information out there about it - that 's a taboo for you			1
' but while there is little that women can do to control the amount of eggs the lose during the ageing process , fertility clinics are keen to point out that they can be very successful in offering other solutions			1
freezing eggs is encouraged egg donors are also suggested as a crucial option for women who are struggling to conceive			1
more and more women are now putting off having babies until their forties dr @entity231 is medical director of the @entity232 , a practice which makes patients aware very early on in fertility treatments of all of the options available			1
she said : ' it is true , that a significant group of our patients are women over 40 years of age			1
in the last few years , we have seen the number of women in this age category coming to the clinic for fertility treatment dramatically rise			0
' however , as the saying goes ‘ @entity248 wait for none ’			0
' to avoid this desperate situation , women need to be aware first and foremost and should be encouraged to freeze their eggs in their twenties and early thirties if they are going to delay childbearing			1
' ( and ) women in their forties can improve their fertility by leading a healthy lifestyle including eating a balanced diet with high protein and high fibre , exercising regularly and avoiding smoking , drinking and using recreational drugs			0
' a spokesperson for the @entity267 has also cautioned that success rate for @entity94 have improved dramatically in recent years			1
they said : ' while @entity94 techniques have progressed significantly in the last 20 - 30 years and are improving all the time , it is important to remember that @entity94 does not guarantee success			1
' fertility levels drop significantly when a woman passes her mid- 30s , and we would always encourage women to inform themselves of the facts around fertility and @entity94 - as the fact is that the chance of success for a woman of 35 is around one in three			1
' it is also very important that women discuss their options with clinicians , to ensure any treatment is suited to their circumstances			0
' @entity103 believes that girls and boys should be taught about fertility alongside sex education at school however , there is no getting away from the fact that for women to be aware that they should even be freezing their eggs in the late twenties , they need to be better educated about fertility			1
@entity103 is now campaigning for fertility to be taught in schools alongside sex education , so that both men and women are aware of the situation when they are growing up			0
she said : ' statistically , if you 're talking to a group of teenagers , it is more likely that they are going to have fertility problems than that they are going to have a child before they are 18			0
' what women have done in our generation is we have gone into a professional working world that is built around the male template of fertility , which is to work really hard in your twenties and thirties and have a family in your forties			1
' we have adopted a male pattern of working and it does n't fit female fertility			0
' we need to have some very big changes in the way our society is structured if women are going to be able to have children			0
' @entity103 has written the book : @entity103 is the author of rocking the @entity339 : 12 - weeks to your plan b for a @entity342 .			0

the tv presenter wants girls to have babies first and work later
women aged 40 only have three per cent of their eggs left
@entity94 on women aged 43 - 44 has a five per cent success rate
