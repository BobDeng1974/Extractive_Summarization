@entity0 moved swiftly on tuesday morning to play down suggestions that some early - round matches are soon to be restricted to pay - per - view television channels			1
according to @entity7 , senior @entity6 executives have discussed the possibility of sharing matches with @entity10 as a way of splitting the costs of broadcasting @entity0			1
however , sources at the @entity14 quickly pointed out that any decisions about how the matches are broadcast , and on which platforms , are down to how the tournament chooses to sell its rights			1
@entity21 claimed the @entity0 title in 2014 on terrestrial tv and @entity25 officials have insisted that the @entity6 are not in discussions with @entity27 to split some early - round matches with pay - per - view channels early - round matches involving @entity31 and the like are not at risk of moving to pay - per - view tv they were quick to dispel fears that a tasty match in the first week featuring @entity31 , or one of the major international names like @entity38 or @entity39 , would be denied to anyone not prepared to pay extra for it			1
' @entity0 has always had a good relationship with the @entity6 and has a contract with them until 2017 , ' a @entity0 spokesman told @entity45			2
' there has definitely not been any contact with @entity10			0
' the @entity6 has covered @entity0 for nearly 80 years and there is a strong emotional bond between the two institutions			1
there is also , in line with the modern @entity0 's more hardheaded outlook , recognition of the value of being on terrestrial television			0
@entity31 , who claimed the @entity0 title in 2013 , is a crowd favourite at the @entity14 @entity38 is another household name at @entity0 who fans will still be able to watch on the @entity6 the power of getting showcased on mainstream tv was shown only this weekend , with a factor in @entity65 's crushing @entity64 win over @entity66 being that he is seen more often on television available to every household			1
however , the world is changing quickly and one of the secrets of @entity0 's ongoing success is that , while maintaining its veneer of tradition , it has never been afraid to change with it			0
nobody knows exactly how the media landscape will be in five years ' time , let alone 10 , so nothing should be ruled out in the medium to long term			0
and even the smallest move away from the @entity6 monopoly of broadcasting the big fortnight in the @entity83 would be an act of major symbolism			2
@entity86 is another who draws the crowds at @entity0 and who can still be viewed on @entity6 @entity91 's early - round matches will also continue to remain on @entity6 for the foreseeable future the fact is that only the finals weekend is protected as being free - to - air under the ' crown jewels ' designation , but talk of @entity83 's armchair fans going without coverage if they do not take out a subscription is alarmist			1
on the @entity6 's side , they are concerned about their budgets in light of licence - fee settlements , and have had arrangements of shared coverage to cut costs with @entity110 and the @entity111			2
yet @entity0 , a one - off event spanning two weeks , is a very different animal			0
@entity115 's @entity114 , the @entity116 at @entity117 , has also been an event keen to be on free - to - air television , which is one reason it can be seen on @entity121 in the @entity83			0
as far as @entity0 is concerned , nothing could be done without the say - so of the hierarchy at @entity25 , who have shown no sign either in public or private that they are wishing to dramatically alter the status quo			2
while they will not be afraid to react to changing circumstances , the @entity83 tennis - watching public should not be alarmed at this point			0
@entity133 clinches her first after beating @entity86 in october 2014 in @entity134 djokovic and 2014 women 's singles champion @entity138 pose with their trophies in july			0

@entity27 have been in *negotiations* to share early - round coverage of @entity0 with the @entity6 , according to a report in @entity7
but @entity14 have denied that this is in fact the case
@entity25 officials have *highlighted* that only *organisers* of tournament have right to sell broadcast rights and decide on which platforms it is shown
@entity6 has covered @entity0 for 80 years and has contract until 2017
all @entity156 has no plans to move away from terrestrial broadcasting
