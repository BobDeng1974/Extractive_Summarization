by @entity0 for many years @entity1 , who at his heaviest tipped the scales at more than 400 kilograms , battled with his food addiction , and at the time of his death had n't walked on his own for more than 7 years			1
his wife @entity7 described looking after him as ' just like taking care of an overgrown baby ' , and @entity1 fell in and out of a deep depression over the state his life was in			2
the couple live on the island of @entity15 , just a four hour flight from @entity17 - where 6 out of 10 people are classified as either overweight or obese			2
' when @entity1 and i met he was already a big man			0
so when he asked me to marry him i knew what i was getting myself into ' , @entity7 said during a @entity30 documentary - which tracked the couple 's life over @entity1 's final years			1
from there the couple embarked on a difficult and challenging journey to try and get @entity1 to lose weight - each doctor giving him the same ultimatum - lose weight , or your life			1
the man was confined to his bed , and @entity7 did everything for him from cooking his food to cleaning every inch of his huge body , and helping him go to the toilet			0
@entity1 was so huge he was unable to do anything on his own , and became short of breath ever just from speaking at his heaviest the man weighed in at over 400 kilograms , or 900 pounds @entity1 could barely speak without becoming short of breath , let alone stand up or move from the bed he was confined to			1
he often needed the assistance of an oxygen machine			0
but @entity7 and @entity1 had dreams to start a family and have children , despite never having consummated their marriage due to @entity1 's extreme obesity			1
in desperation , he reached out to a woman from @entity63 , @entity64 , named @entity65 who lost more than 80 kilograms after undergoing gastric surgery and is now an advocate for others looking to change their lives in the same way			0
@entity1 desperately needed surgery which reduces the size of the stomach by 80 percent , but could not undergo it until he lost at least 40 kilograms on his own first			2
he battled with severe depression and was confined to his bed for the last years of his life he desperately needed gastric surgery to remove 80 percent of his stomach but had to lose weight before that could take place from there the morbidly obese man 's life over the next few years took a cyclical and repetitive nature which eventually lead to the breakdown of his marriage , and later , his death			1
first dr @entity90 , originally a refugee from @entity91 who trained in @entity92 as a obesity specialist , took the trip to @entity15 with @entity65 to assess the state of @entity96 and the possibility of @entity1 undergoing surgery			1
dr @entity90 told @entity1 he must shift some weight on his own before he can even consider any procedure , and also laid some of the responsibility on @entity7 as she is the one who cooks for him			1
she admitted she was not strong enough to resist his begging for food - and lots of it - and said despite being immobile her husband was in control			0
his wife @entity7 cooked for him and struggled to say no to her husband when he insisted on more food during one visit he was so heavy he could not even stand on the scales on his own and needed to lean on furniture ' when it comes to food and @entity1 wants something he 'll keep going on and on and on and on until i finally give it to him			2
it 's very hard because i am his wife - can i control his eating habits , no i ca n't			0
' when dr @entity90 reached out to a clinic on the @entity121 , the head of the facility dr @entity124 gave @entity1 the same ultimatum			0
if he could n't lose any weight on his own then he could not be helped , it was simply too dangerous to try and perform surgery			0
the possibility of moving @entity96 to @entity63 for an operation slowly became more and more impossible as he failed to lose weight , and the next step was to reach out to a doctor in @entity135			1
world leading obesity surgeon @entity136 , from @entity17 @entity135 , also made the trip to @entity15 to discuss the possibility of performing the surgery closer to home for @entity96 - but again gave the man the same conditions			1
during the programme , he said : ' it 's hard being stuck here , i ca n't go nowhere i 'm so depressed ' in the end , @entity7 and @entity1 's marriage broke down			2
@entity1 took some pills and stopped breathing			0
he died aged 39 when he delivered it @entity96 and @entity7 broke down , and said they could n't handle hearing that @entity1 had to lose weight on his own any more as they believed they had done all they could			1
' it 's hard being stuck here , i ca n't go nowhere i 'm so depressed			0
i 'm stuck in this bed every single day			0
every single day ' , @entity1 said through tears earlier in the documentary			0
in the end , @entity7 and @entity1 's marriage broke down and @entity1 took ' some pills ' and stopped breathing			2
an hour and a half of cpr by paramedics failed to revive him and he died aged 39			0
@entity1 's story highlights the obesity epidemic sweeping the world - and shows although he was presented with many ways out he could not overcome his demons			2
he described his relationship with food as ' like a bad drug addicts battle with ' , and his official cause of death was determined to be morbid obesity following his death on november 10 , 2012 .			1
