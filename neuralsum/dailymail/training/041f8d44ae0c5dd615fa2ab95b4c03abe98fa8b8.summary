mr @entity3 acted after an independent report said the closures were based on flawed analysis			1
the guidance from the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) comes after a bitter fightback by threatened units at @entity21 , @entity22 in @entity9 and the @entity23 in west @entity10			1
health secretary @entity3 told the @entity4 he was unhappy at the way a £ 6million review proposed axing units in @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			1
he said a new independent panel had found ' too many questions unanswered ' and the closure programme was being suspended			0
the @entity30 and @entity31 has proposed closing units at @entity21 ( @entity21 ) , @entity22 in @entity9 and the @entity23 in west @entity10			1
but the decision was heavily criticised and campaigners have fought ferociously against the plans			0
a new report by the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) found serious problems with the way the running of the review , mr @entity3 told mps			1
he has now asked @entity42 to continue with the process of looking into the reorganisation of children 's heart surgery and asked them to report back by the end of july			2
he said that while the @entity18 agrees with the need for change in the services the @entity42 provides , it found the @entity30 and @entity31 ' was based on a flawed analysis of the impact of incomplete proposals and leaves too may questions about sustainability and implementation '			1
mr @entity3 added : ‘ this is clearly a serious criticism of the safe and sustainable process			2
‘ i therefore accept their recommendation that the proposals can not go ahead in their current form and am suspending the review today			2
’ the decision was welcomed by campaigners , who had warned children in need of heart surgery and their families			2
would have to travel too far to reach their nearest unit if the closures went ahead			2
welcome : campaigners were delighted at the news that the closures were to be halted			0
@entity76 is pictured with her son @entity77 , 11 , from @entity78 , as he recovers from heart surgery at @entity21 smiles : @entity81 and her 11 - year - old son @entity82 from @entity83 at @entity21 relief : @entity85 with her son @entity86 , aged four , from @entity8 and former patient and now @entity89 campaigner @entity88 , aged 16 , ( right ) welcomed the news that the closure process had been suspended prime minister @entity92 said : ‘ i think we have to be frank with people that we ca n't expect really technical surgery - like children 's heart operations , to be carried out at every hospital in the country			1
‘ as the parent of a desperately ill child , wanting to get the best care for that child , you need to know that you 're getting something that is world best			0
‘ for really technical operations you ca n't get that everywhere			2
clearly the conclusion is that this process , which started in 2008 , has n't been carried out properly so we need to make a re-start			0
’ uncertainty : children 's heart surgery at @entity23 in west @entity10 had been to to end but the closure has now been suspended the original decision to close the three units was part of a general review of children 's heart services across @entity42 based on the premise that there was a need to concentrate expertise in more specialist centres			1
the @entity30 and @entity31 review followed the landmark inquiry into children ’s heart surgery at @entity133 between 1990 and 1995 , where up to 35 children and babies died as a result of poor care			1
in the wake of the inquiry , it was recommended that paediatric cardiac units be set a target for the number of operations per year , and surgery be concentrated in a few specialist centres in order to ensure quality of care			1
the proposals had suggested the institutions which were to house the specialist surgery centres were : @entity153 , which is part of @entity155 's and @entity156 , @entity157 , both in @entity10 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , the @entity161 in @entity162 and @entity163 in @entity164			1
@entity165 in @entity166 was originally part of the consultation process but it suspended its children 's heart programme in 2010 following a spate of deaths			0
safety : units at @entity22 in @entity9 and @entity21 were also earmarked for closure by a £ 6million review , which has now been identified as ' flawed ' senior medical figures today insisted that major changes still needed to go ahead			1
dr @entity179 , @entity42 clinical director for children and young people , said there was a ‘ compelling case for change ’			0
‘ we will have a plan by the end of july , then we would hope to move to implementation of whatever this plan is going to show us by 12 months ' time , ’ she told @entity185 's @entity186			0
‘ this is ambitious but i think it shows the gravity with which we take this and our complete ambition to do this in the interests of getting improved children 's outcomes , making it safer and making the entire surgical service sustainable			0
‘ we understand this is a highly emotionally - charged issue but what we are attempting to do is outline a national service for children			0
’ lord @entity208 , chairman of the @entity18 , said : ‘ we have listened to a wide cross-section of individuals and organisations during recent months , giving us the opportunity to meet and hear from many parents , children , frontline staff , local charities and volunteers involved in these services			0
‘ the focus of this review and the panel 's advice is fundamentally about the long - term future and best interests of children with congenital heart disease			0
‘ the critical factor to consider , in the panel 's view , is that engagement of all interested parties is the key to achieving improvements for patients and families without unnecessary delay			0
‘ there is now a real opportunity to involve patients , public and other stakeholders in taking work forward as set out in the @entity18 's recommendations			0

units were threatened at @entity21 , @entity22 in @entity9 and the @entity23 in @entity10
@entity3 tells mps a £ 6million review was based on ' a flawed analysis '
but senior medical figures insist change must go ahead
@entity31 recommended units be set a target for the number of operations per year with surgery be concentrated in a few specialist centres
