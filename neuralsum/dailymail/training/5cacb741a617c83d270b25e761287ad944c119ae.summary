by @entity0 published : 11:22 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 11:22 est , 4 april 2013 lasers have long been big beauty news among the glitterati - @entity3 , @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 are all fans			2
but with prices in excess of £ 300 for a full face treatment in a clinic , they cost more than most of us can afford			1
that could be about to change with the launch of a new £ 450 laser gun which claims to zap away ageing wrinkles			1
wrinkle buster : lasers are routinely used to tackle skin conditions such as acne as well as unwanted hair while it might sound like something you 'd see in @entity27 , the laser gun is actually the latest technology in @entity30 beauty treatment			1
the @entity31 is the first device to offer clinical - strength laser technology in a device that can be used safely at home			2
while its price tag of £ 450 may look steep , it costs the same as just one treatment at a professional clinic , where patients typically undergo 10 sessions of laser blasts to see visible anti-ageing improvements			1
the hand - held device works by harnessing the same light - based fractional laser technology that is used in professional clinics to fight fine lines and wrinkles , as well as changes in skin texture and discolouration			2
the laser creates light energy which stimulates production of new collagen , the ingredient that pumps up the skin and irons out wrinkles			2
although you wo n't have to go to a salon to use it , the company does say that it has to be used every day for at least eight weeks to see noticeable results			0
fan : @entity64 opera singer @entity5 is believed to be a fan of lasers like this one by @entity31 ( right ) fan : pregnant @entity7 has laser facial treatments youthful : despite all the parties , @entity6 still has great skin wrinkle free : @entity3 's glowing skin belies her true age in a clinical study by skin experts , three in four users experienced a significant improvement in fine lines and wrinkles , discolouration and redness			1
independent consultant dermatologist dr @entity82 said : ' @entity83 's @entity31 allows you to treat yourself in the comfort of your home			0
' a session in a clinic is more intense and last longer , therefore the recovery time may be longer			0
' the effectiveness of @entity91 lies in the fact that you treat yourself for a few minutes daily , over an eight - week period , so you eventually reach the benefits of an in - clinic laser treatment by small steps			1
' it is priced at approximately the same cost of one in - clinic treatment			0
i would recommend by clients to have at least 10 @entity31 treatments to see visible anti-ageing results			0
' the @entity105 is available at triabeauty.co.uk and at @entity107			0
safe : lasers might sound like something out of @entity27 but unlike @entity112 , they wo n't harm you			0

the new wrinkle - busting @entity30 laser gun from @entity91 costs £ 450
prices for salon lasering cost in excess of £ 300 per session
lasers are often used to treat acne , wrinkles and thread veins
