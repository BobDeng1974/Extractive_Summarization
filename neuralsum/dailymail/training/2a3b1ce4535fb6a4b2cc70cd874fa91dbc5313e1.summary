brave boy : @entity30 contracted swine flu in 2009 and since then has been in and out of hospital and needed a new kidney to save his life recovering : boo with his parents @entity9 and @entity35 and dr @entity36 , left , who performed the risky surgery at @entity39 @entity40 had to undergo surgery to fuse a vein and artery in his arm to enable blood flow so he could easily receive dialysis treatments - a procedure known as arteriovenous fistula			1
but as a result of this , the engorged vessel caused a blood pressure spike in his lungs , which meant a kidney transplant was not an option for him			1
dr @entity36 , who performed the risky surgery at the @entity39 in @entity56 , @entity57 , told @entity58 : ' he was told by many doctors that he was not a candidate for a transplant			1
i talked to his dad and said , " i think maybe we can fix this "			2
' he found a way to reverse the fistula			2
' it was scary in the sense of " i hope i 'm right " , ' he said			0
' it was bold , but it needed to be done to fix this problem			0
' @entity40 would have died if the move had backfired			0
but the reverse procedure worked and the blood pressure in @entity40 's lungs dropped to a normal level , meaning he was ready for a kidney transplant			1
miraculously , both of his parents were matches , but because his mother @entity35 was the healthier of the two , his parents decided she would donate her kidney			1
fighter : boo , pictured leaving the hospital in 2011 , nearly 500 days after he first contracted swine flu dad : @entity9 , pictured in 2011 , said the family have @entity93 to thank for their son 's miraculous recovery @entity35 is also recovering well from surgery and though it was a success , @entity40 suffered from a blood clot soon after which landed him back in intensive care			1
