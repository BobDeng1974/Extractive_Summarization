a campaign group in a village that was split over noisy church bells branded ' prejudicial to health ' believes it has come up with a solution - a device to make them ring more gently			1
the bells at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity7 have been chiming every 15 minutes for around 118 years			1
but a row broke out in the village after some families complained when the bells started again after being silenced for repairs two years ago			1
device : chairman of @entity18 @entity17 confirmed that @entity19 had raised £ 3,000 funds for the new device for @entity9 ( pictured ) following an investigation by @entity24 it decided the chimes were ' prejudicial to health ' with some villagers claiming they could n't get a good night 's sleep			1
last december @entity18 stopped them chiming every 15 minutes between 11pm and 7am to avoid being issued with a noise abatement notice , but they could still ring on the hour			1
chairman of @entity18 @entity17 confirmed that @entity19 had raised £ 3000 funds for the new device			1
a diocese of @entity35 spokesman said the clock chimes are the responsibility of the parish council , but the chancellor of the diocese would have to give permission for the device to be fitted			1
after the decision by the council , campaign group @entity43 called for a referendum and it was given ' at least six months ' to find another solution			1
the group said it believes it has now found a compromise @entity52 , of @entity53 designed a hammer device to control the volume of the chimes overnight			1
@entity52 , who has an engineering background and has worked on church bells before , contacted @entity59 to offer the solution			1
he plans to fit a different hammer which will produce a softer sound when it strikes the bells			1
the hammer will be controlled by a timer already fitted in the clock tower to switch off the chimes at night			1
noise : @entity52 , of @entity53 designed a hammer device to control the volume of the chimes overnight the device is adjustable so he can ensure the chimes are below the level deemed acceptable by the @entity73 campaigner @entity59 said everyone who had seen the prototype was impressed and the disagreement ' should be resolved soon '			1
the mother - of - two said : ' we worked so hard to save the chimes and find a solution to please as many people as possible			0
' this device is really good news			2
i hope there are no objections and we get good new on january 13 as it is also my birthday			0
' @entity59 , who now lives in @entity89 , @entity88 added : ' when we would go out as teenagers we would listen for the chimes so we knew when we had to be home			0
' people who live in towns might not understand it , but the chimes are part of village life			0
it was such a shame a minority felt they had to spoils it for everyone else			0
but there were people having disturbed sleep			0
' no one wanted to lose chimes all together - even the people who could not sleep			0
' but @entity108 , 80 , who has brought up her children in the village , said she has become ' disillusioned ' by the ongoing row			0
the retired post office worker said : ' i do n't know why people move into a village knowing there are bells and country smells and then moan about it			2
' i have lived here very many years and i miss the chimes when they are not working			2
it is part of village life			0
' i am so disillusioned about it			0
my son and i have stopped talking about it			0
' the bells , which chime through @entity9 's clock mechanism , have been ringing since around 1896			1
grade i listed @entity130 's church was built during the 14th century and its tower is the tallest in @entity7 with its wood and leaden spike rising to 76 ft ( 53.6m )			2
the church was presented with a three - faced clock by mr @entity136 in 1896			0
it is said the side facing the @entity139 was left blank so that the @entity139 and @entity141 workers would not be clockwatchers			0
@entity59 added : ' it 's an unbelievable device , because unlike others that churches have used , it does n't muffle the hammer , which quietens the bells 24/7			1
' perhaps with a mechanism like this , maybe other churches around the country may one day see the end to @entity154 on their bells			2
' she added : ' if this device is installed and solves the problem then we plan to approach other churches where bells have been silenced			1
' @entity9 ’s is one of a number of churches to have been silenced in recent years following bell noise complaints			1
in september , @entity166 in @entity167 , @entity168 , was at threat of being silenced after a complaint from a resident who lived 300 yards away			0
@entity172 , 60 , recorded the bells ' sound at at 85 decibels , as loud as passing traffic , and told the council they were ' destroying his peace and quiet '			2
last year , meanwhile , the bells of @entity181 ’ church in @entity182 , @entity7 , were silenced from 11pm to 7am after a single complaint from a resident whose sleep was being disturbed			2
but church leaders said the automated system , which meant the bells went off once an hour , could not be set to operate at specific times and so would have to be deactivated			2
a month before this , an environment protection team suggested @entity191 , in @entity192 , @entity193 , silenced its bells between the same hours			2
this again stemmed from a single complaint			0
in 2011 , a pensioner confronted a group of six professional bell - ringers before locking them in a church tower after the noise took its toll			1
the unknown elderly man swore at the group having climbed the narrow staircase to the belfry of @entity207 in @entity208 , near @entity209 , @entity210			0
after protesting to the bell - ringers - who had travelled from the south of @entity214 especially - and threatening to damage their cars , the man then closed the door to the tower and wedged it shut with a piece of wood , leaving the half - dozen musicians , aged between 46 and 65 , trapped			0
they were shut in for half an hour on sunday before being freed by a member of the church who heard banging from the trapdoor when she went to lock up .			0
