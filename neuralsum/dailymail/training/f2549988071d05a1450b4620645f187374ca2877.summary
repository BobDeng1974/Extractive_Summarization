by @entity0 it ’s an experience that many of us have been through - you wake up after a night out with a feeling of dread , worried about what you did the night before			0
and , thanks to @entity10 and @entity11 , there are numerous reminders about your antics posted online			0
the @entity15 app has been designed to make this feeling a little less permanent by letting you post as many drunken updates and photos as you like , before they 're automatically deleted after 24 hours			1
these nearby people can choose to ' cheer ' , comment , or add the user as a 24 - hour friend			1
once the request is accepted , users can send messages , and after 24 hours , the friendship is deleted unless both sides tap keep the @entity36 section is the photo feed			1
users can post photos and view photos by others posted in the past 24 hours			1
to ‘ cheer ’ a photo - which is similar to liking a post on @entity10 , or selecting a user on @entity46 - drag the image to the right			1
to ‘ pass ’ a photo , and remove it from the feed , swipe it to the left			2
the @entity54 function lets users send private messages to friends using a username or phone number			1
@entity23 is free and available from the @entity60			2
but @entity62 users can still receive and view text and voice messages from @entity15 users through sms where they will be directed to a browser through a link - and these also expires after 24 hours			1
it even deletes friendships that you made overnight , too			0
@entity23 was co-founded by developer @entity73 after a night out in @entity74			0
‘ with @entity23 , you are free to be your crazy self wherever you are , ’ explained @entity73 on the @entity15 blog			2
‘ enjoy your life in the moment and have fun			0
@entity23 will make sure there is no evidence of your craziness			0
you will always be ‘ sober ’ online			0
' unlike other social media , @entity23 is not about what you did , but what you ’re doing			2
’ users start by posting a photo on @entity15 , which is seen by people in the same geographical area			1
these nearby people can choose to ‘ cheer ’ , comment , or add the user as a 24 - hour friend			1
once the friend request is accepted , users can send messages and share images , and at the end of the 24th hour , the friendship is deleted – unless both sides tap keep			1
the @entity54 function ( pictured ) lets users send private messages to friends using a username or phone number			1
@entity23 is free from the @entity60			0
but non-iphone users still receive and view messages from @entity15 users via a link to a browser - and these also expire after 24 hours the self - destruction feature of @entity23 is similar to @entity10 ’s slingshot			1
the tech giant 's self - destructing message launched last month and is designed to appeal to fans of @entity119 and other messaging apps that let people send self - destructing messages to friends			2
however , the app adds a novel twist , as users can not see a friend 's picture until they send one back			2
after downloading the app , users sign up either with a @entity10 account or a phone number			0
after taking a photo , users can type a message of up to 140 characters on it , draw a picture or send a 15 - second video			0
they can then send it to some , or all , of their slingshot contacts			0
on @entity115 , users can see a message only if you send one back			0
until they do , they 'll only see a pixelated preview of what 's in store			0
the self - destruct feature is similar to @entity119 and @entity10 ’s @entity115 , but the developers claim @entity23 is different because photos are only shared within the user ’s geographic area			1
‘ most people do n’t remember over half of what they did or said the day before , and it does n’t make sense that your phone does , ’ said co-founder @entity73			2
‘ there certainly are things that happen in @entity74 that you would prefer they stay in @entity74			0
’ the @entity36 section is the photo feed			0
users post their own images , and view photos by others , uploaded in the past 24 hours			1
to ‘ cheer ’ a photo - which is similar to liking a post on @entity10 , or selecting a user on @entity46 - drag the image to the right			1
to ‘ pass ’ a photo , and remove it from the feed , swipe it to the left			0
the @entity54 function lets users send private messages to friends using a username or phone number			2
