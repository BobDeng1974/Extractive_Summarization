by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 02:48 est , 24 june 2013 @entity3 : 03:00 est , 15 august 2013 one of the senior health officials accused of ordering the deletion of a damning report in care at a baby unit today denied leading a cover - up			1
@entity10 , the former deputy chief executive of the @entity11 , insisted that a crucial meeting to discuss a study into @entity14 did not demand it be destroyed			1
the claim that the ms @entity10 told an official to ' read my lips ' and delete the report proved one of the most explosive to emerge from an investigation into care failings			1
up to 16 babies and two mothers are feared to have died between 2001 and 2012 due to poor care at the maternity unit at @entity29 general hospital , part of the @entity32 foundation trust			2
despite multiple warnings about the dreadful failings at the hospital unit , a @entity11 report gave the trust a clean bill of health after a two - day inspection in 2010			1
@entity41 , head of regulatory risk and quality at the @entity11 , produced a document showing that the 2010 inspection had been seriously flawed			1
but she claims she was told to delete it , according to an independent report by chartered accountants @entity49 published last week			2
it said that at a meeting in march last year , ms @entity51 said : ‘ are you kidding me ? this can never be in the public domain , nor subject to a freedom of information request			0
' it was also claimed that ms @entity10 told ms @entity41 to ' read my lips ' and delete the report			1
but ms @entity10 today insisted this was not true			2
she said : ‘ at that meeting we reviewed the report and the report concluded that the activity that @entity11 had undertaken at @entity14 was satisfactory			1
‘ it was quite clear on reading the report that the activity was not satisfactory and the @entity11 should have done more			1
‘ so at that meeting we agreed that the report required much further work , there was not a decision at that meeting to delete the report , nor was there an instruction			2
’ storm : former @entity11 chief executive @entity79 ( left ) and media manager @entity51 have also faced criticism she claims that while ms @entity41 believes that there had been an instruction to delete her report , ‘ the other three individuals in that meeting do not recall that instruction ’			1
however she admitted that the @entity11 had not regulated @entity14 properly			2
‘ the report concluded it was adequate , we in the meeting felt it was not adequate , @entity11 should have done more at @entity90			1
failings at @entity90 hospitals have ' echoes ' of the @entity95 care scandal , @entity91 warned			1
the author of the damning report into neglect at the @entity100 , where up to 1,200 people may have died needlessly , condemned the lack of transparency			2
mr @entity104 , pictured , warned : ' it seems to me that there are considerable echoes of what i found			2
' there has been apparently a lack of candour and openness at @entity115 , there was a failure of a regulator to find out that things were going wrong , and there appears , or could well have been , in many different places , a lack of openness and transparency			0
' he claimed there was an institutional problem with the @entity127			0
he told @entity128 : ' one of the problems with the @entity127 – one of its advantages , but one of its problems – is that it ’s hugely complex			0
' and as a result of that it has many different bits of it which have to interrelate with each other			0
' and it becomes quite easy in such an organisation for matters of concern to disappear between the cracks			0
' ‘ at the point of registration we should have done more and when it was registered as a @entity14 we should have exercised more concern			0
’ she complained that she had been subjected to a ‘ media feeding frenzy ’ without any notice			0
‘ if @entity11 felt that they wanted to produce a report where they named and shamed individuals in the public domain then they should have made sure that they followed a fair process , ’ she said			1
‘ they did not follow a fair process			0
we made several representations to @entity49 about the accuracy of the way in which they were recording the information and the way in which they were beginning to treat one allegation as ( an ) act			0
‘ @entity49 did not reply and did not change the way in which the allegations were presented			0
‘ at that meeting i did no such thing and as a result of the way in which they redacted the names , what they generated was a complete media feeding frenzy			0
the first time i saw the final report was when i read it online on tuesday night and by wednesday morning the media feeding frenzy had begun			0
’ @entity185 , who wrote the internal review , claims she confronted senior management with her critical findings but that ms @entity10 ordered it to be deleted			2
@entity79 , then @entity11 chief executive , and media manager @entity51 also deny any attempted cover - up at the meeting			1
ms @entity10 suggested that a lack of sufficient resources meant it was ‘ always going to be a very , very tall order ’ for the @entity11 to do its job effectively			1
‘ the fact that the regulatory activity in @entity90 could have been better was undoubtedly a feature of the very , very sizeable agenda @entity11 had to lead			1
’ ministers had been warned it would be ‘ challenging ’ when the body was set up , she said			0
the new management ‘ has received substantially more funding ’ , she said			0
‘ it is able to employ more professional staff then we were able to do and to recruit people who are of a higher level of seniority			0

@entity10 *rejects* claim in major report that she *sanctioned* a cover - up
