but it has now emerged that lawyers representing @entity1 have claimed that if @entity2 had provided mandatory sexual harassment training , then @entity16 may never have filed the case			1

as reported by @entity33 7 , in a letter , @entity1 ’s lawyer @entity32 , said : ' @entity35 has a legal obligation to provide sexual harassment training to all management level employees			1
@entity35 failed to provide such training to mayor @entity1			1

city councilman @entity67 said : ' his employers , @entity2 taxpayers , did not have to bail him out for the mess he created			0
' earlier in the day in a closed session , the @entity50 voted 9 - 0 to have the city sue @entity1 to require that he pay all costs incurred by the lawsuit , which names the city as a defendant in addition to @entity1			1
' if @entity1 engaged in unlawful conduct and the city is held liable , he will have to reimburse us every penny the city pays and its attorney fees , ' city attorney @entity79 said			1

land - use surveyor @entity156 published a newspaper notice sunday to begin a recall bid , two days after gay rights activist and newspaper publisher @entity160 did so			2
@entity156 accused @entity162 of being a stealth supporter of the mayor and threatened to file a complaint with the @entity168 district attorney 's office alleging election law violations			0
@entity156 said @entity162 would make little effort to collect the more than 100,000 signatures needed to get a recall measure on the ballot , setting it up to fail and preventing another recall drive for six months			0
@entity162 denied the accusation tuesday , saying @entity156 or anyone else was welcome to join the recall drive			0

everyone is focused on this scandal			0
that is not good for this city , ' he said			0
confusion over whether recall petitions can circulate concurrently is n't the only procedural flaw uncovered since the mayor came under pressure to resign			0
the city attorney 's office says a rule that voters must cast a ballot on a recall to be eligible to pick a replacement should be repealed because a federal judge struck down a nearly identical law during the successful 2003 recall of @entity49 gov. @entity215			0
@entity216 , chairman of the @entity168 @entity217 , said friday that he did n't expect big @entity217 donors or business leaders to make significant donations to a recall			0
