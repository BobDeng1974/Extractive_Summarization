by @entity1 reporter an inmate in a @entity4 jail costs just as much as four years ' tuition at an @entity7 college according to a new report			2
the city 's annual cost per inmate was $ 167,731 last year or $ 460 per day			1
the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) blames much of the expense on the running costs of the city 's most notorious lockup , @entity16 which is literally an island unto itself			1
expensive inmates : inmates file out of the prison bakery at @entity16 , the notorious jail blamed for @entity4 's high annual inmate costs			1
last year they spent $ 167,731 ( $ 460 per day ) on each inmate @entity23 , who in 2009 resigned as the city 's correction commissioner , noted that hundreds of millions of dollars are spent a year to run the 400 - acre island in the @entity27 next to the runways of @entity29 that has 10 jail facilities , thousands of staff and its own power plant and bakery			1
he said : ' other cities do n't have @entity16			0
' the city 's @entity36 annual figure of $ 167,731 - which equates to about $ 460 per day for the 12,287 average daily @entity4 inmates last year - was based on about $ 2 billion in total operating expenses for the doc , which included salaries and benefits for staff , judgments and claims as well as debt service for jail construction and repairs			1
but there are particularly expensive costs associated with @entity16			2
@entity16 : the 400 - acre compound is in the @entity27 next to the runways of @entity29 and has 10 jail facilities , thousands of staff and its own power plant and bakery the department says it spends $ 30.3 million annually alone on transportation costs , running three bus services that usher inmates to and from court throughout the five boroughs , staff from a central parking lot to @entity16 jails and visitors to and around the island			1
there were 261,158 inmates delivered to court last year			0
a way to bring down the costs , @entity23 has long said , would be to replace @entity16 with more robust jails next door to courthouses			2
but his attempts to do that failed in part because of political opposition from residential areas near courthouses in @entity81 , @entity82 and elsewhere			0
he said of the budget figure : ‘ my point is : have you seen a whole lot of outcry on this ? why does n't anything happen ? because nobody cares			0
’ ‘ that 's the reason we have @entity16			0
we want these guys put away out of public view			0
’ @entity4 's annual costs dwarf the annual per - inmate costs in other big cities			1
@entity99 spent $ 128.94 a day , or $ 47,063 a year , for 17,400 inmates in fiscal year 2011 - 12 , its sheriff 's office said			1
doing time : the @entity11 says that the jail 's transport alone costs $ 30.3 million annually the cost of college : the city 's cost per inmate at jails such as @entity16 ( left ) cost nearly as much as four years tuition at an @entity7 university such as @entity111 ( right ) @entity112 spent $ 145 a day , or $ 52,925 a year , for 13,200 inmates in 2010 , the most recent figures available from that county 's sheriff 's office			1
those costs included debt - service and fringe @entity118 note that @entity4 's high annual price tag is deceiving because it reflects considerable pensions and salary responsibilities , debt service and the expensive fixed costs			1
the @entity11 says 86 per cent of its operating costs go for staff wages			0
@entity4 's system differs from other cities in some other costly ways - it employs 9,000 relatively well - paid , unionised correction officers , for example , and is required by law to provide certain services to inmates , including high quality medical care within 24 hours of incarceration			2
@entity139 , a public health professor at @entity140 , said the latest city figures show that declining incarceration rates have not translated into cost savings			0
in 2001 , when the city had 14,490 inmates , the full cost of incarcerating one inmate at @entity16 for a year was $ 92,500 , or about $ 122,155 adjusted for today 's dollars - that means the city spent $ 45,576 more in 2012 than it did 11 years ago			1
no worries : @entity23 , who in 2009 resigned as the city 's correction commissioner , says that so much money is spent on the 400 - acre jail because ' nobody cares ' prof @entity139 said : ‘ to my mind , the main policy question is : how could we be spending this money better ? what would be a better return on that investment ? ’ another contributing factor to the inmate price tag is the length of stay for prisoners in @entity4 's criminal justice system			2
some inmates have waited years in city jails to see trial			0
the @entity11 said in 2012 that the average length of stay for detainees was 53 days and 38.6 days for sentenced inmates			0
@entity176 , a former commissioner of the city 's @entity11 and probation who serves as director of the @entity181 , said : ‘ not only is that a miscarriage of justice , it affects your operations			0
‘ you want to save big money ? take a quarter out just by improving the process they go through when they 're in the system			0

inmates at @entity4 's jails cost $ 167,731 every year ( $ 460 per day )
the @entity11 blame the high costs on the notorious @entity16 , an expensive operation
some $ *30.3million* is spent on transportation alone
per inmate @entity201 spends $ 128.94 per day , @entity112 $ 145 per day
