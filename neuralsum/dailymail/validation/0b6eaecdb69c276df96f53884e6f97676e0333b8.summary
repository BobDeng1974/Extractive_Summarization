@entity0 is said to have ordered testing of a laser to be used in the @entity3 a secret ' death ray ' laser was developed during the @entity3 and ordered for testing by the then prime minister @entity0 , documents reveal			1
@entity8 was said to have worked with @entity9 to develop the high powered lasers for use on the battlefield during the 1970s and 1980s			2
the beam , nicknamed a ' death ray ' , had been developed quickly because of fears over the weapons possessed by the @entity17 - but was never used			0
but @entity0 was said to be so impressed with the technology she ordered testing to take place during the @entity3 , the @entity18 reported			2
existence of the laser was revealed in the @entity24 , in a letter - marked ' top secret ' from the then defence secretary @entity26 to @entity0 in 1983 about the weapons owned by the @entity17 and @entity8 's position			1
it said : ' you may recall that we developed and deployed with great urgency a naval laser weapon , designed to dazzle low - flying @entity34 pilots attacking ships , to the @entity36 in the @entity3			1
' the weapon was not used in action and knowledge of it has been kept to a very restricted circle			0
' the letter was revealed under the 30 year rule			0
@entity45 academic dr @entity44 found the letter in his search of the archives and said the ' naval laser weapon ' referred to a device tested , but never used in anger , when troops were defending the @entity53 in 1941			1
@entity0 ( pictured front , centre ) visited @entity56 when it came back from the @entity3 this device used powerful searchlights to dazzle pilots as they attacked @entity61 ships			1
in 1982 , when the @entity63 was invaded , it was decided to use the same tactics to try and blind enemy pilots			0
in the 1980s @entity8 was said to be focused on developing medium power lasers directed against relatively softer targets such as eyes , optic and electro - optic sensors			2
these weapons was designed to target low flying aircraft by ' dazzling ' pilots targeting ships			0
the ' death ray ' was said to be unlikely to be unsuccessful in targeting ships but would work on humans			0
@entity8 's laser weapon research in the 1980s was covered by two programmes - known as @entity79 and @entity80			1
according to the correspondence from mr @entity26 , @entity8 had been working with @entity9 on developing laser weapons since the 1970s			1
mr @entity26 also detailed fears in his letter to @entity0 about the @entity17 were developing a range of secret beam weapons			1
however he said he was uncertain whether owning these weapons was useful			0
in the letter he added : ' the @entity89 could be in a position to field such weapons by the mid- 1980s ( in fact , the @entity89 may already have deployed a laser weapon on the cruiser @entity95 ) '			2
the @entity3 lasted from april to june 1982 , with the loss of 255 personnel from the @entity8 .			0

@entity8 *believed* to have worked with @entity9 on development of lasers
