by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 26 september 2012 updated : 07:07 est , 2 october 2012 it is set to be a confusing time for consumers wanting to buy a tablet or an e-reader			0
@entity6 is set to take on @entity7 and @entity8 with two new versions of its nook tablet unveiled today , joining an already crowded marketplace			1
the new devices are a @entity15 tablet with a 7 - inch screen , starting at $ 199 , and a @entity15 + with a new 9 - inch screen , starting at $ 269			2
in addition to new hd screens and a lighter body , @entity6 is also increasing the services the @entity22 offers , adding a video purchase and rental service , allowing users to maintain different ' profiles ' and making it easier to browse titles in its book and magazine stores			1
@entity33 - based @entity6 , the largest traditional @entity35 bookseller , has invested heavily in its @entity22 e-reader and e-books			1
the company will continue to sell its smaller black - and - white e-reader , called the @entity40 , for $ 99 , and a backlit @entity40 for $ 139			0
the @entity15 runs on @entity44 's @entity43 4.0 system and includes @entity6 's own app store and browser			1
it is an upgrade to the hardware and services offered by its previous tablets , the @entity51 and @entity52 , which @entity6 is phasing out			2
however , the firm faces a tough battle			0
seven out of every 10 tablets sold in the second quarter were @entity57 , according to @entity58			2
@entity7 has a 4.2 percent share of the tablet market , while @entity6 has a 1.9 percent share , according to @entity58			1
however , experts say the bookseller is in with a chance			0
' if the decision the consumer is making is whether to buy based on hardware , these new @entity22 will beat out @entity7 , ' said @entity69 analyst @entity68			2
' but that 's not the decision every consumer is going to make - hardware is only as good as the services the hardware enables			0
' so far , @entity7 offers more services , @entity68 said , with a bigger app store , and more extensive video library , not to mention @entity7 's vast product offerings and its @entity79 free - shipping service			1
in an attempt to measure up , @entity6 is launching a video service that lets users buy and watch movies and tv shows on their mobile devices and televisions			2
the offerings will come from major studios including @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			0
scrapbook and catalog browsing features have also been added			0
one wild card working in @entity6 's favor this holiday : @entity98 and @entity99 , increasingly threatened by @entity7 's online retail operations , wo n't carry the @entity101			1
the retailers will sell @entity6 's @entity22 , as well as other tablets like the @entity57			1
' this is going to be a lot of fun to watch over the next year , ' @entity68 said			0
the new @entity22 are available for pre-order online and in stores beginning on wednesday and will begin shipping in late october and begin arriving in stores in early november .			0
