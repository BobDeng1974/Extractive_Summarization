@entity1 's exit we were told by @entity4 [ coach @entity3 ] that @entity5 had been let go between sessions in the practice game against @entity8			1
i think @entity4 had only just found out himself			2
you see it when football clubs get taken over ; you tend to see different people brought in for key positions			2
@entity5 was a lovely guy and i feel sorry he ’s lost his job but when you get new people in , changes always happen			2
there have been a few names bandied around and i think @entity22 [ @entity23 ] was considered last time the role came up a year ago , but he did n’t particularly fancy it			1
he ’s certainly a very good man , but it ’s hard to know who would be a good candidate until we know more about what the job role is			1
but @entity23 , @entity32 and @entity33 are all former @entity35 captains who would all bring their own experience and knowledge to the role			1
@entity38 admits he was sorry to see @entity39 leave his role in the @entity41 @entity39 ( centre ) was sacked as @entity41 managing director after a dismal @entity44 this year @entity45 he seems in a really happy place and excited to be back around the group			1
he ’d be the last person to make too much of a fuss about a hundred in a warm - up game but i ’d back him to score big runs in this series — he looks refreshed and ready to go			1
@entity54 it ’s incredibly important that all the players feel they can contribute and speak up when they need to			2
that can be quite a scary thing but you only get better as a group when you do that			2
i did an @entity63 event with @entity65 winger @entity64 and he was saying how player - led they were at the club			2
during the @entity44 we did n’t talk enough as players and the guys were n’t speaking up as much as they needed to			0
we needed more edge and hopefully bringing guys like @entity74 and @entity75 [ @entity76 ] back into the group will help that			0
@entity38 has backed @entity45 to score big runs during the series in the @entity81 captain cook scored a century during a warm - up game against @entity8 & @entity84 @entity85 i used to watch videos of my dad playing in the 1986 - 87 ashes series and i ’ll always remember @entity85 ’s commentary on that			1
he had this way of sounding as if he was reciting commentary when he was commentating and making it relaxing and peaceful to listen to			0
i do n’t think there ’ll be anyone in the cricket world who wo n’t be touched by his passing			0
his voice symbolised cricket and we ’ll all miss him			0
@entity102 he ’s one of my best mates and we ’ve played a lot of cricket together			0
he ’s taught me a huge amount and guided me through my international career			0
i think we ’re third behind @entity107 [ @entity108 ] and @entity109 [ @entity110 ] and @entity111 [ @entity112 ] and @entity113 [ @entity114 ] as a pairing and that comes from us complementing each other ’s styles and constant communication			0
it would a phenomenal achievement for him to become @entity35 ’s leading wicket taker			1
@entity38 says that he and @entity102 are best mates and admits he has guided him through his career @entity38 says it will be a great achievement for @entity102 to become @entity35 's leading wicket taker fitness twisting my ankle in the warm - up game was a bit of a scare , but it feels fine now			1
there was a burning feeling for a minute or so after it happened and i was pretty worried			0
it ’s still bit stiff in the morning but fingers crossed it will be ok			0
@entity138 they ’re generally pretty flat out here now and i think fans can expect some fairly attritional cricket for the first few days before things speed up a bit			0
we ’ve been practising our slip catching low down by our ankles because we ’re not expecting a lot of carry			0
i think the team that wins the series will be the one that shows most patience and gets the best out of reverse swing			1
@entity38 twisted his ankle during the warm - up match but insists he feels fine now			1

@entity35 start their three @entity160 series against @entity161 next *monday*
@entity38 is backing captain @entity45 to score big runs in series
*bowler* admits he is sorry to see @entity39 leave role in @entity41
