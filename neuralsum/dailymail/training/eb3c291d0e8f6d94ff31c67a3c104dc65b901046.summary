girls born to members of the @entity2 are to be given equal rights with boys in the succession to the throne as centuries - old rules were overturned today			1
as the historic changes to the monarchy were agreed , the @entity12 , at the @entity9 summit in @entity10 , @entity11 , hailed the power of women to change the world			1
the reforms mean the if the @entity19 and @entity20 of @entity22 's first child is a girl , she will take precedence over any younger brothers in the order of succession			2
reform : the @entity19 and @entity20 of @entity22 's first born child will inherit the thrown after @entity30 struck a deal with @entity9 leaders to end the rule that the first - born male takes the thrown good evening your majesty : the @entity12 receives @entity30 at a banquet as part of the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) royal arrival : the @entity12 and the @entity42 rrive for the @entity39 banquet , which was held at the @entity44 the 16 @entity9 ' realms ' , including the @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity11 , also agreed to scrap outdated laws which ban anyone in the line of succession from marrying a @entity52			1
the changes were announced by prime minister @entity30 at the @entity39 in @entity10			0
as politicians unanimously agreed the dramatic reform to royal succession laws dating back more than 300 years , the @entity12 said the untapped potential of women and girls should be set free			1
speaking at the opening of the summit of the 53 @entity9 countries , she said : ' the theme this year is @entity64			1
' it reminds us of the potential in our societies that is yet to be fully unlocked and it encourages us to find ways to allow all girls and women to play their full part			2
' we must continue to strive in our own countries and across the @entity9 together to promote that theme in a lasting way beyond this year			2
' her comments will be taken as a sign that the @entity12 approves of the reform			1
the prime minister struck the deal to scrap male primogeniture by thrashing out an agreement with @entity9 leaders			0
mr @entity30 said the historic rules were ' at odds with the modern countries that we have become '			0
announcing the proposed changes , he said : ' put simply , if the @entity19 and @entity20 were to have a little girl , that girl would one day be our queen			0
' yet it is still likely to be many years before another female monarch takes to the throne			1
the @entity2 already has two generations of kings - in - waiting and the @entity12 is celebrating her @entity96 next year and in good health			1
her own mother , the @entity98 , lived to 101			0
heir apparent the @entity100 is next in line and then there is @entity103 , who has still to fulfil his regal duties before any child of his takes over			0
even then , @entity103 and @entity20 might have a son , meaning the nation would wait even longer to see the first royal daughter to benefit from the rule change			1
girl power : the @entity12 today hailed the the power of women to change the world as a deal was struck to let first - born daughters take the throne most @entity118 monarchies have already established an equal law of succession - it is in force in @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , the @entity127 and @entity128			1
now only @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 are left with the old system			0
the ancient rules of royal succession have handed men the balance of power for hundreds of years			2
if the new rules had been in force in 1509 @entity137 would have taken the throne instead of @entity141 that could have meant the @entity142 would never have taken place and @entity144 would never have been @entity12			1
if the practice had been changed as recently as the last century , @entity46 could have had two @entity146 back to back			0
princess @entity148 , the princess royal would have acceded to the throne in 1901 instead of @entity151 when she died just a few months later , her son @entity152 would have ascended the throne – something which could have prevented the @entity155			2
the @entity12 now would have been the completely unknown princess @entity156			1
the @entity12 and @entity157 , the @entity11 prime minister arrive for the opening ceremony of the @entity39 in @entity10 this morning where she spoke about equality mr @entity30 stepped in amid fears that there could be a constitutional crisis if @entity103 and @entity20 had a first - born daughter and then a son			1
the deal was agreed today in @entity10 during a meeting of the @entity167 – the 16 countries including the @entity46 which share the @entity12 as their head of state			1
mr @entity30 , who hosted the meeting , had earlier said : ‘ these rules are outdated and need to change			2
the idea that a younger son should become monarch instead of an elder daughter , simply because he is a man just is n’t acceptable any more			2
' nor does it make any sense that a potential monarch can marry someone of any faith other than @entity52			1
the thinking behind these rules is wrong			0
that ’s why people have been talking about changing them for some time			0
we need to get on and do it			0
’ keynote address : the @entity12 makes the opening speech for the @entity9 summit as leaders of member countries look on heads of government stand during the opening ceremony of the 2011 @entity39 the removal of the barrier to the heir to the throne marrying a @entity52 does not affect the position of the @entity203 as the established @entity203			1
the queen and future monarchs will be @entity206 and @entity207			0
the change will also do away with an ancient and unused rule that means all descendants of @entity211 are supposed to require the consent of the monarch to marry			1
the deal will take the form of a short communiqué signed by the realms committing to ‘ amending the rules on succession to their respective crowns ’ and making clear that they ‘ wish unanimously to advise the @entity12 of their views to seek her agreement ’			1
in order to change the rules the government will introduce legislation to change the @entity229 , the @entity230 , the @entity231 and the @entity232			2
@entity233 has said changes would be drafted in such a way that any children of prince @entity103 and his wife were included , but for current members of the @entity2 , there is not expected to be any difference			0
any new law is not expected to be retrospective - the princess royal would still be placed below her two younger brothers , the @entity19 and the @entity244			1
for some , the changes do not go far enough			0
@entity246 , which campaigns for a directly - elected ceremonial head of state , said they still failed the ' equality test '			2
@entity249 , campaign manager for @entity246 , said : ' in practice , it simply means that the eldest child of one family is preferred over all others			0
' inequality is therefore further entrenched in the system			0
' @entity257 , @entity258 , could have ended up on the @entity46 throne had laws been different had an @entity262 law not been passed by @entity263 , @entity46 's monarchy throughout the past 300 years would have had a very different cast of characters			1
for starters , rather than becoming one of the most recognisable faces in the world , our present @entity12 would have spent her life as a minor princess in some @entity274 backwater			1
and instead of pledging allegiance to @entity12 , loyal @entity46 subjects would now be singing @entity277 to ... @entity278 of @entity279			1
the 1701 @entity280 passed the crown to @entity282 of @entity283 and her @entity285 descendants - and banned all @entity52 from ever ascending the throne			1
that law - and the centuries - old practice of male primogeniture , in which a male child automatically leapfrogs over his older sisters - has largely dictated who became @entity277 or @entity293 for centuries			2
but according to historian @entity295 writing in the @entity296 , had these ancient laws not been adopted , @entity278 would now be ruling @entity298			0
@entity257 , @entity258 , is a distant cousin of the @entity12 and head of the @entity300 , @entity279 's ruling family			2
he is the senior co-heir - general of @entity302 and therefore regarded as the rightful heir to the @entity304 , which ruled @entity305 from 1567 to 1707			0
from birth @entity257 was recognised by the @entity307 as a prince of @entity305 , @entity309 , @entity310 and @entity311 , prince of @entity313 and @entity314			0
the @entity19 's great - grandfather was the last king of @entity279 before being deposed at the end of @entity155 in 1918			0
during @entity319 , the @entity318 ' family condemned the @entity321 regime and fled to @entity322			0
when @entity324 's stormtroopers marched into @entity325 in 1944 , the @entity2 was arrested and detained in a number of concentration camps			0
following liberation in 1945 , @entity257 , studied business management at the @entity330			0
now 78 , he still lives in an apartment in the city and is a keen collector of modern art.			0

300 - year rule scrapped as first - born , whatever gender , will take the throne
reforms also overturn law that bans monarch from marrying a @entity52
