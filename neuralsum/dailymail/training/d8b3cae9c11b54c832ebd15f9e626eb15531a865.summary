by @entity0 published : 13:10 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 16:50 est , 20 june 2013 @entity1 is very fun			0
it 's just not very pretty			0
in fact , for one of the @entity6 's launch line - up , it 's hard to see anything ' next gen ' about its visuals			1
but it does n't take long for this racer to start clawing back some points - with its intuitive gameplay mechanics and balanced handling			1
appearances can be deceiving : do n't be fooled , the @entity1 demo looked very different to this image the playable gameplay demo was only 35 per cent complete and featured one track			1
still , there 's a remarkable sense of speed			0
cars may not be the raw , overly - aggressive beasts that roamed @entity28 2 , but each one still has its own distinct character			2
while the sleek @entity30 glides gracefully through the corners , the @entity32 , spits , hisses and charges through each turn with the elegance of a dumdum bullet			0
to stop races feeling stale , you can compete with friends during certain sections - be that to see who can achieve the best drift , or who can complete a certain section fastest			1
in time trials , they appear as ghosts so it helps you keep track of the competition			0
sadly , for those hoping @entity1 's graphics would be a showcase of @entity6 's nuclear - powered hardware , you 'd be sorely disappointed			2
everything in the demo looked rough and ragged , trees would pop up in the distance , and cars looked lifeless and lacking shine			2
interiors , too , although detailed , looked low - res , paling in comparison with upcoming current - gen title , @entity68 6			1
there 's no denying @entity1 will be enjoyable racer , but it 's in need of some serious engine tuning if it 's to turn heads on next gen. fast and furious : cars are n't quite the animals seen in @entity76 but they still have plenty of character @entity1 is a @entity6 launch title			1
let us know what you think on @entity82 : @ @entity83 and on @entity84 : @entity85 .			0

enjoyable , well - balanced racing and intuitive gameplay mechanics
graphics paled in comparison to @entity68 6 and @entity76 , both of which are current gen titles
demo showed game only 35 per cent complete , so visuals likely to *improve*
