hundreds of hospital wards have been forced to close due to the spread of the winter vomiting bug , as fears grow that this winter 's outbreak could prove to be the worst on record			1
new figures released yesterday by the @entity8 revealed cases of the bug are at a five - year high - with more than two - thirds as many people struck down this year as during the same period in 2011			1
in the past week , schools from @entity14 to @entity15 have been forced to close after soaring numbers of children have fallen victim to the highly contagious norovirus			1
the dotted line representing 2012/13 shows how , in the latter part of 2012 , cases of norovirus have rocketed			1
despite a recent dip , the number of cases is still high a total of 335 hospital wards in @entity29 and @entity30 have been closed to new visitors since the start of this year 's outbreak - with 43 shut down in the past fortnight alone			1
and as well as norovirus , there are numerous other vicious bugs going around			2
on tuesday , 140 of the 639 pupils at @entity38 in south west @entity39 , were off sick			1
@entity40 said the number was unprecedented			1
the huge early outbreak is thought to represent the worst start to the norovirus season on record , with some experts blaming particularly frigid november temperatures for the staggering numbers of cases			1
the new @entity8 figures show there have been 2,630 confirmed cases - where samples have been checked in the lab - since july			1
this is 72 per cent higher than the same period in the last season when there were 1,533 cases reported			1
but this figure is likely to be only a fraction of the true total as most sufferers do not see their gp			1
officials at the @entity8 estimate that for every confirmed case there are another 288 in the community			0
this means that 757,440 people could be affected by the stomach bug			2
there has been a slight dip in cases in the last week or two but an @entity8 spokesperson said this was no indication the virus was tapering off , particularly as the vast majority of cases in the community go unreported			2
@entity80 , an expert in norovirus at the @entity8 , said : ' our figures show a small drop in the number of confirmed cases over the last couple of weeks			1
' we can not read too much into this at present as this is typical of the norovirus season , where we see a series of sharp rises and falls in activity between october and april with the bulk of cases usually occurring between january and march			2
' some experts say the highly contagious virus has arrived early this year and caught the @entity99 ' unawares '			0
infections tend to peak in january and february			0
but this year 's early outbreak could go on to see this norovirus season become the worst on record			2
experts say the virus has arrived earlier than usual this year and caught the @entity99 ' unawares ' in @entity107 , parents have even been banned from nativity shows at one @entity110 school			0
more than a quarter of the 400 children at @entity113 primary school near @entity114 have been struck down in the suspected norovirus outbreak			1
several teachers have also been affected			2
few have escaped the clutches of the virus			0
in @entity121 , a bride and groom were among 40 guests taken ill after their wedding reception			0
just five people at @entity125 and @entity127 's party at the @entity128 , in @entity129 , on saturday , were not struck down by a stomach bug			0
several members of staff have also been affected			2
the cause of the crippling bout of sickness and diarrhoea is now being investigated by environmental health officers from @entity138			0
but hotel bosses emphatically deny the food was to blame and said it was caused by the contagious winter vomiting bug			0
dozens of hospitals have also been forced to close their wards			2
unprecedented : at @entity146 in south west @entity39 ( pictured ) , 140 of the 639 pupils were off sick with the bug yesterday in @entity149 , four wards have been closed to new patients after an outbreak at the county ’s biggest hospital			1
the restrictions mean up to 80 beds at the 1,100 - bed @entity156 are out of action and unable to take emergency cases from its overstretched @entity160 unit			1
in @entity107 , three wards at @entity162 have been closed to new admissions			1
the outbreak is the second in a matter of weeks at the hospital , where 38 patients and 14 staff have been affected			1
and in @entity14 , three wards have been closed after the bug struck @entity172			1
the norovirus has even hit passengers on board a luxury cruise ship for a festive tour of @entity180 's @entity179 markets			0
in an update on the situation , a spokeswoman for @entity183 's parent company @entity182 said there had been ' an incidence of a mild gastrointestinal illness ' among the passengers			0
she added that as of today , of 1,843 passengers , ' the number of passengers with active symptoms is six '			2
but she was unable to confirm how many people have been affected in total			1
the @entity8 advises the following measures : do not visit your gp surgery or local @entity199			0
norovirus infection is a self - limiting illness and you will recover naturally without treatment			2
it is , however , important to take plenty of drinks to replace lost fluids			0
use @entity209 's new diarrhoea and vomiting online health and symptom checker , to get advice on how to manage your symptoms at home or help to access the most appropriate health service visit the @entity209 website : ww.nhsdirect.nhs.uk / @entity218 / @entity219 wash hands thoroughly and regularly at all times , but particularly after using the toilet and before eating			0
do not visit friends or relatives in hospitals or residential care homes as there is a real risk that you would introduce the infection , putting vulnerable people at risk			0
one passenger , who claimed crew members had ignored the plight of those stricken by the bug , described the trip as ' a cruise to hell '			0
dr @entity241 , head of the gastrointestinal diseases department at the @entity8 said : ‘ the norovirus season is always completely unpredictable as it peaks and falls over several months – usually october to april			0
however , one thing we do know is that every year we will see a large amount of norovirus activity because it is highly contagious			0
' the bug can be transmitted by contact with an infected person , by consuming contaminated food or water or by contact with contaminated surfaces or objects			0
the virus spreads rapidly in closed environments such as hospitals , schools , nursing and residential homes			1
its symptoms include a sudden onset of vomiting and / or diarrhoea			0
some people may have a temperature , headache and stomach cramps			0
the illness usually resolves in one or two days and there are no long - term effects .			2
