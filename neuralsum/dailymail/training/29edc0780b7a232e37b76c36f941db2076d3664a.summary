scientists have discovered a surprising new property of graphene – the world ’s thinnest and strongest material – that could accelerate the development of electric cars and other green technologies			1
researchers have found that the newly discovered type of carbon graphite , which is found in pencil lead , allows positively charged hydrogen atoms or protons to pass through it			1
their discovery could increase the efficiency of fuel cells for cars , because the cells generate electricity from hydrogen			1
researchers have found that the newly discovered type of carbon graphite called graphene , which is found in pencil lead , allows positively charged hydrogen atoms or protons to pass through it			1
an atomic - scale honeycomb lattice made of carbon atoms is pictured the researchers , led by @entity32 winner sir @entity31 of @entity33 , who discovered graphene , said their finding raises the possibility that , in future , graphene membranes could be used to ‘ sieve ’ hydrogen gas from the atmosphere to generate electricity			1
this is because the one - atom thick material acts like a filter to allow protons to pass through it , while blocking the passage of other atoms			2
the team demonstrated this when they combined the substance with a single - atom material called boron nitride			0
scientists were able collect protons on one side of a membrane , with other blocked atoms accumulated in a chamber			2
using such a membrane , fuel cells could extract hydrogen from the air and burn it in order to power electric cars , which would n’t spew out environmentally harmful emissions			1
the discovery could increase the efficiency of fuel cells in cars , because the cells generate electricity from hydrogen			1
while hydrogen is being used to fuel concept cars ( pictured ) the technology has a distance to go before it is widely commercialised green technology : sir @entity31 and phd student @entity79 hope that graphene could one day be used in proton - conducting membranes , which are a crucial component of fuel cells , used to power ' green ' cars			1
they found that graphene membranes could be used to extract hydrogen from the atmosphere , suggesting the possibility of combining them with fuel cells to make mobile electric generators powered just by tiny amounts of hydrogen in the air			1
medicine : experts say that graphene could be used as a vehicle for delivering drugs to specific sites in the body , which could one day mean new treatments for people with brain conditions , for example			0
transport : @entity110 ’s strength and lightness makes it an ideal material to incorporate into cars and aeroplanes in a bid to make them safer and more fuel efficient			2
thin coatings : the thin and strong material could also be used to make corrosion - proof coatings , packaging and even super-thin condoms electronics : the material conducts electricity efficiently so it could be used to make new types of smartphones and as well as flexible wearable technology			2
purifying water : scientists are working on using the material as a membrane to separate liquids , so it could one day be used to purify water in areas of the world that do not have access to the essential liquid			2
‘ we are very excited about this result because it opens a whole new area of promising applications for graphene in clean energy harvesting and hydrogen - based technologies , ’ said @entity140 , co-researcher on the study			1
at just one atom thick , graphene is the thinnest material on @entity151 and is also 200 times stronger than steel			0
it was first isolated in 2004 by sir @entity31 and his fellow researchers , who received a @entity32 in 2010 for their work			0
the material is impermeable to all gases and liquids , giving it the potential for a range of uses such as corrosion - proof coatings , packaging and even super-thin condoms			0
the new discovery , published in @entity168 , came about because the team wanted to investigate whether protons ( hydrogen atoms stripped of their electrons ) were repelled by the material , which is impermeable to the smallest atom , hydrogen			1
they were surprised to find that the protons could pass through the ultra-strong material fairly easily , especially at raised temperatures and if the graphene films were covered with nanoparticles such as platinum , which acted as a catalyst			1
sir @entity31 and dr @entity79 hope that graphene could one day be used in proton - conducting membranes , which are a crucial component of fuel cell technology			0
fuel cells , used in some modern cars , use oxygen and hydrogen as fuel and convert the input chemical energy into electricity			1
but a major problem is that the fuels leak across the existing proton membranes to reduce the cells ' efficiency			0
this problem could be overcome by using graphene			0

it was first isolated in 2004 by sir @entity31 ( left ) and dr @entity204 ( right ) who were awarded the @entity32 in 2010 the team found that graphene membranes could be used to extract hydrogen from the atmosphere , suggesting the possibility of combining them with fuel cells to make mobile electric generators powered just by tiny amounts of hydrogen in the air			1
‘ essentially , you pump your fuel from the atmosphere and get electricity out of it , ’ sir @entity31 said			0
‘ our ( study ) provides proof that this kind of device is possible			0
’ dr @entity226 , a postdoctoral researcher and the first author in this work , added : ‘ because graphene can be produced these days in square metre sheets , we hope that it will find its way to commercial fuel cells sooner rather than later ’			2
@entity234 , professor of @entity235 and co-director of the @entity237 at @entity238 , said : ' the report that protons can penetrate atomically thin layers is both exciting and surprising , especially given that the measured activation energies are significantly lower than predicted by theory			0
' dr @entity245 , @entity246 specialising in fuel cells of @entity248 , said : ' while there are challenges to overcome in the manufacture of these 2d layers on a practical scale and questions to be resolved over the mechanism of proton transport , this exciting discovery could have a significant impact on a range of technologies in the energy sector			2
' for example , if such a layer could be successfully incorporated between the electrodes of a hydrogen fuel cell , the issue of gas crossover would be completely eliminated , resulting in step changes in power output and stability			0
' this would have major implications for an environmentally - friendly technology on the brink of commercialisation			0

graphene is the world *'s* thinnest and strongest material that is impermeable to atoms and molecules
researchers from the @entity33 were surprised to find that positively charged hydrogen atoms - protons - can pass through it
@entity286 could boost efficiency of fuel cells for cars generating electricity from hydrogen , by using a graphene - based membrane
