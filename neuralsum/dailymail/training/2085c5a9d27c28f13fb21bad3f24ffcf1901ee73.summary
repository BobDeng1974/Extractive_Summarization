the senior @entity12 warned mothers and fathers who repeatedly praise the looks of their child could be fuelling insecurities about their looks			2
ms @entity1 says seemingly innocuous comments about the hair , looks or outfit of one of their children could be reinforcing the negative message that looks are the most important thing in life			1
the 33 - year - old , who does not have any children , said mothers should also be wary of moaning or boasting about their looks in front of their children for the same reason			0
instead , ms @entity1 mp for @entity33 , said parents should praise their children 's intelligence and other positive attributes to help them succeed in life			1
in an interview with @entity39 , the @entity12 said : ' i know as an aunt , you fall into the trap of turning to your neice and saying , " you look beautiful " - because of course all children do look beautiful - but if the message they get is that is what is important and that is what gets the most praise , then that 's necessarily the most positive message you want them to hear			1
' she added that instead praising them for skills like an ability to do a jigsaw , or positively commenting on their inquisitive nature was a healthier way to bolster their self - esteem			0
instead of praising looks , ms @entity1 says parents should compliment their child when they show curiosity or intelligence she was speaking ahead of the launch of the government 's campaign on body confidence			2
she quoted statistics that show a quarter of all children aged 10 to 15 are unahppy about their appearance , while more than 70 per cent of girls feel that there is too much of a focus on the attractiveness of female celebrities			2
' she added : ' it 's not like saying looks do n't matter at all			0
if you 're going for an interview , you will dress smartly and look the part , that is absolutely fine , but its just the level to which this becomes the ultimate focus of everything			0
' she added that when children see their parents bemoaning their weight or asking their children 's opinion on their appearance it teaches them that appearance is disproportionately important			0

@entity12 @entity1 says children may focus on looks if they are *forever* told how beautiful they are
she says intelligence should be praised instead
far too many children are *obsessed* with the way they look , she adds
