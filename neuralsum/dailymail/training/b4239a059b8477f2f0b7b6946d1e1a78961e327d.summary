based on a gecko 's feet , the gloves are coated with a specialized cloth called ' @entity10 '			1
impregnated with a reversible adhesive elastomer , they cling to surfaces the same way that the gecko 's feet do			1
dubbed the @entity17 project , the new , specialized climbing paddles were developed for @entity19 by @entity21 ' @entity20			1
recently , @entity19 demonstrated the latest iteration by having a 218 - pound researcher with 50 pounds of recording gear scale a 25 - foot tall glass wall			0
geckos can climb on a wide variety of surfaces , including smooth surfaces like glass , with adhesive pressures of 15 - 30 pounds per square inch for each limb , meaning that a gecko can hang its entire body by one toe			1
the anatomy of a gecko toe consists of a microscopic hierarchical structure composed of stalk - like setae ( 100 microns in length , 2 microns in radius )			2
from individual setae , a bundle of hundreds of terminal tips called spatulae ( approximately 200 nanometers in diameter at their widest ) branch out and contact the climbing surface			1
dubbed the @entity50 project , the new , specialized climbing paddles were developed for @entity19 by @entity21 ' @entity20			1
' the gecko is one of the champion climbers in the @entity54 , so it was natural for @entity19 to look to it for inspiration in overcoming some of the maneuver challenges that @entity3 forces face in urban environments , ' said dr. @entity61 , the @entity19 program manager for @entity17			0
' like many of the capabilities that the @entity65 pursues , we saw with vertical climbing that nature had long since evolved the means to efficiently achieve it			0
' the challenge to our performer team was to understand the biology and physics in play when geckos climb and then reverse - engineer those dynamics into an artificial system for use by humans			0
' recently , @entity19 demonstrated the latest iteration of its @entity10 by having a 218 - pound researcher ( saddled with 50 pounds of recording gear ) scale a 25 - foot tall glass wall			1
' the @entity87 programs aims to develop biologically inspired climbing aids to enable warfighters to scale vertical walls constructed from typical building materials , while carrying a full combat load , and without the use of ropes or ladders			1
geckos can climb on a wide variety of surfaces , including smooth surfaces like glass , with adhesive pressures of 15 - 30 pounds per square inch for each limb , meaning that a gecko can hang its entire body by one toe thanks to a microscopic hierarchical structure composed of stalk - like setae ( 100 microns in length , 2 microns in radius )			1
now researchers hope to create a paddle to allow human s to climb a 16 - square - inch sheet of @entity10 adhering to a vertical glass wall while supporting a static load of 660 pounds			1
a gecko is able to climb on glass by using physical bond interactions — specifically @entity120 intermolecular forces — between the spatulae and a surface to adhere reversibly , resulting in easy attachment and removal of the gecko ’s toes from the surface			2
the van der waals mechanism implied that it is the size and shape of the spatulae tips that affect adhesive performance , not specific surface chemistry			0
this suggested that there were design principles and physical models derived from nature that might enable scientists to fabricate an adhesive inspired by gecko toes			0
' @entity10 ' is one output of the @entity144 program			2
it is a synthetically - fabricated reversible adhesive inspired by the gecko ’s ability to climb surfaces of various materials and roughness , including smooth surfaces like glass			2
performers on @entity17 designed adhesive pads to mimic the gecko foot over multiple length scales , from the macroscopic foot tendons to the microscopic setae and spatulae , to maximize reversible van der waals interactions with the surface			0
@entity19 says the project could give it the upper hand in battle			0
' historically , gaining the high ground has always been an operational advantage for warfighters , but the climbing instruments on which they ’re frequently forced to rely — tools such as ropes and ladders — have not advanced significantly for millennia			0
' @entity19 created the @entity175 program to overcome these limitations and deliver maximum safety and flexibility for maneuver and rapid response to warfighters operating in tight urban environments			0
' the goal of the program is to develop biologically inspired climbing aids to enable warfighters carrying a full combat load to scale vertical walls constructed from typical building materials			2

dubbed the @entity190 project specialized climbing ' gloves ' allow soldiers to climb walls
based on a gecko 's feet , the gloves are coated with a specialized cloth called ' @entity10 '
