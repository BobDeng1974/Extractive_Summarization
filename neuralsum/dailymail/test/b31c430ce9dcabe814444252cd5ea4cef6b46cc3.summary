a tortoise has been reunited with his owner after spending nearly a year on the run and even finding a new home - at the age of 109			2
owner @entity6 , 74 , had given up hope of ever seeing @entity8 again after he escaped from her garden 11 months ago			1
but he has now returned home and after piecing together his escapades over the last year , it 's become apparent he 's had quite an adventure			0
reunited : @entity6 , 74 , is delighted to have 109 - year - old @entity8 back after his escape 11 months ago he wandered through a gate in her garden and headed for the open road where he was picked up by a passing driver concerned for his safety and taken to a nearby animal rescue centre			1
six months ago , he was re-homed with a couple living in @entity22 , @entity23 , 22 miles away from @entity6 's farm in @entity25			1
but the couple , who could just about make out the word ' @entity6 ' written in white paint on his shell , felt they needed to find out who @entity30 belonged to			1
with nothing else to go on , they decided to call every @entity6 in @entity23 listed in the phonebook			1
eventually came across a delighted @entity6 , who immediately arranged to collect him			2
she 's had @entity8 since the 1980s when he was given to her by her late great aunt			2
he was returned home last sunday , a full 11 months after his amazing , if a little slow , adventure			0
@entity6 has had @entity8 since the 1980s and wrote her surname , @entity6 , on his back in white paint retired farm worker @entity6 said : ' i had painted my name and number on the side of his shell but it had faded when he went missing so they could n't read it			1
' the people who found him could read @entity50 but they could n't make out the number			0
' he had got out because i had left my gate open			0
it is normally closed because we have sheep in the paddock but they were in a different field			0
' @entity8 just walked out and trotted towards the road where somebody picked him up and took him to a rescue centre			1
' everyone knows i have a tortoise and we always take him to the village fete so he is a bit of a local celebrity			0
' i was devastated when he went missing and spent weeks looking for him in all the fields around the farm			0
' she added : ' i went all goosey when they told me they had @entity8 because i had really given up on him			2
' it is brilliant having him back and i think everybody was keeping their eye out for him all this time			0

@entity8 escaped out the back gate from his @entity6 ' garden in @entity23
he was picked up by a driver on a nearby road and taken to a rescue centre
six months later he was re-homed with a couple in @entity22 - 22 miles away
@entity8 had ' @entity6 ' written on his shell so the couple tried calling every @entity6 in @entity23 before reuniting him with @entity89 months after escape
