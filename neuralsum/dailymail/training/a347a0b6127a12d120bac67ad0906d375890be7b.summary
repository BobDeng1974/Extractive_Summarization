@entity9 , @entity2 ’s director of policy for @entity11 , told the @entity12 into media ethics that the company enforced a strict ban on people who did not represent themselves under their real identity			1
lord @entity9 , an @entity19 mp and aide to @entity21 , who was hired last year to lobby the @entity22 on @entity2 ’s behalf , said the policy was rigorously enforced to stop people using bogus identities to carry out malicious acts			1
' @entity28 ' account : lord @entity9 , @entity2 's director of policy for @entity11 , was found to have another account , in contravention of the firm 's policy however , at the time lord @entity9 spoke , he had two ‘ presences ’ on the site : one , ‘ @entity9 ’ , shows pictures and links to his work on @entity2			1
the other , ‘ @entity50 ’ , contained a silhouette in place of a picture and gave no indication of who lay behind it apart from ten ‘ friends ’ , including the divorced peer ’s girlfriend			0
after @entity52 started to make inquiries about the ‘ @entity50 ’ identity on friday , it was swiftly deleted			1
lord @entity9 told the inquiry that if people came to the site and did not present themselves under their real identity , they would not have a ‘ meaningful experience ’			0
‘ we have a security team constantly looking for the people trying to get around the system , ’ he said			0
‘ the sort of people carrying out malicious behaviour will use false identities			1
we find the strongest protection is that community of users			0
@entity72 is a notion at the heart of what we ’re trying to do			0
’ both the ‘ @entity9 ’ and the ‘ @entity50 ’ @entity2 identities include @entity78 as one of the friends			1

the issue of @entity2 identities became controversial last year when author @entity88 was told he had to use his birth name @entity90 on his profile instead of his middle name @entity93			2

a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ @entity9 is an active user of @entity2 , using his real identity			0
there was also an old @entity2 account that he set up in 2009 and has not actively used since then			2
