while @entity0 has inherited his hair colour and cute nose from his father , his chubby cheeks and cute chin can be said to hail from the @entity10 side of the family , with @entity10 's baby pictures showing his mother with a determined look and a mop of dark hair			1
@entity67 of @entity68 as a baby , displaying the same lively look and chubby cheeks of the young @entity0 @entity0 looks lovingly at his favourite pal , dog @entity72 , in the family 's official @entity75 picture although he is just eight months old , @entity0 has already had his share of public appearances , most notably outside the the hospital where he had been born just the day before			0

baby @entity10 and her chubby cheeks and cute chin , with parents @entity116 and @entity118 at her christening in 1982 @entity0 wore a cream cardigan over a white shirt , matching shorts and soft leather shoes and socks - ideal for a baby who has just started crawling			1

good looks are in the family : @entity0 's mother @entity10 may have had darker hair than her eight - month - old son but the resemblance is clear to see in this image of @entity10 , being held by her grandmother @entity147 at her christening in 1982 she was also wearing a diamond and platinum silver fern brooch , on loan from the @entity151			1
