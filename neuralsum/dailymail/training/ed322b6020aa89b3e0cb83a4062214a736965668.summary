it is a terrifying sight - 6.2 feet of metal with a plastic body that can walk , run , jump and even open doors			2
this is latest version of the @entity7 robot created by @entity8 , a @entity9 - owned robot firm			1
later this year , seven of the robots will compete in a ' robo oylmpics ' - designed to recreate natural disasters the robots could one day be sent into			2
according to @entity8 , @entity7 is a ' high mobility , humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor , rough terrain			1
' @entity7 can walk bipedally leaving the upper limbs free to lift , carry , and manipulate the environment			1
' in extremely challenging terrain , @entity7 is strong and coordinated enough to climb using hands and feet , to pick its way through congested spaces			1
' a total of $ 3.5 million in prizes will now be awarded to the top three finishers in the @entity29 ( @entity30 ) , the final event of which will be held june 5 - 6 , 2015 , at @entity33 in @entity34			2
aside from the previously announced $ 2 million grand prize , @entity29 plans to award $ 1 million to the runner - up and $ 500,000 to the third - place team			2
@entity29 expects at least twenty teams to compete in the @entity30 finals			0
' the goal of the @entity30 is to generate groundbreaking research and development in hardware and software that will enable future robots , in tandem with human counterparts , to perform the most hazardous activities in disaster zones , thus reducing casualties and saving lives , ' it said			2
the teams using the @entity29 - developed @entity7 robot will use an entirely new version , which is battery powered for the first time			1
the @entity7 robot created by @entity9 - owned firm @entity8 is a formidable figure at 6ft 2in tall and weighing in at 330lb			1
the robot boasts 28 hydraulically actuated joints and stereo vision , and is one of the most advanced robots ever created			0
@entity7 will also now carry an onboard 3.7 - kilowatt - hour lithium - ion battery pack , with the potential for one hour of ' mixed mission ' operation that includes walking , standing , use of tools , and other movements			1
the upgraded @entity7 is 75 percent new — only the lower legs and feet were carried over from the original design @entity72 , of @entity29 said : ' @entity7 unplugged is the upgrade to allow it to run entirely on batteries			1
' we have to cut the cord			0
' ' the new @entity7 is 75 % new , it has much more dexterity and is quieter , and stronger			1
' the introduction of a battery and variable - pressure pump into @entity7 poses a strategic challenge for teams , ' said @entity83			1
' the operator will be able to run the robot on a mid-pressure setting for most operations to save power , and then apply bursts of maximum pressure when additional force is needed			0
' during the finals , a series of events will be held to replicate disasters			0
' the finals will be very hard			0
we want them to be more like real disasters , the robots will have to do all these tasks in sequence with no human help			0
given their identical hardware , the @entity7 teams will have to differentiate themselves through software , control interfaces , and competition strategy			1
the man sized machine can finally operate without wires , thanks to a battery backpack teams will have a few options on the selection of tasks they choose to attempt and the order they do them — and must manage time and battery life during their runs — but @entity29 expects that the top - placing teams will complete all of the tasks			0
teams are likely to keep their robots connected to fall arrestors during much of the remaining months of training as a safeguard against premature damage to the robot			0
@entity29 demonstrated the new @entity7 with a fall arrestor in place			1
' risk mitigation is part of the game , ' @entity83 said			0
' it 's up to the teams to decide what chances they 're willing to take during training and risk falls and damage , but come the @entity145 , the cords are cut			0
' for fans of the cult film the @entity149 , it is a familiar pose			0
however , in the latest video from the @entity154 military team developing a two legged fighting robot , the buildup to ' crane kick ' is seen in a new way			0
the researchers taught the robot to stand on one leg - recreating a key scene from the film in the process			1
' to achieve this level of maneuverability in robots , researchers at @entity174 look toward nature , ' the team say			0
' inspired by the speed of cheetahs , the endurance of horses , the maneuverability of monkeys , and the versatility of humans , @entity174 researchers are on a quest to develop legged robots that are fast , efficient , and graceful , with the mobility required to access many of the same places that humans can			0
' at the @entity193 's @entity192 , @entity166 came second , despite competing as a virtual software simulation			0
despite his lack of limbs , the world 's most innocuously named ' bot was able to walk , carry a fire hose and , most impressively , get in a car and drive it			0
the ' crane ' stance , being held by @entity149 @entity204 ( played by @entity205 left ) in the 1984 film inspired the latest movements of the @entity7 robot			1
it demonstrates strong balancing skills and composure and showcases the agility of the @entity9 - owned machine , said the firm @entity7 is a high mobility , humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor , rough terrain , @entity8 said			1
' @entity7 can walk bipedally leaving the upper limbs free to lift , carry , and manipulate the environment			2
in extremely challenging terrain , @entity7 is strong and coordinated enough to climb using hands and feet , to pick its way through congested spaces			2
the researchers taught the robot the trick to show off its balance			2
the @entity7 robot has an articulated sensor head includes stereo cameras and a laser range finder so it can ' see ' where it is going			1
' articulated , sensate hands will enable @entity7 to use tools designed for human use			2
@entity7 includes 28 hydraulically - actuated degrees of freedom , two hands , arms , legs , feet and a torso			1
' an articulated sensor head includes stereo cameras and a laser range finder			0
' @entity7 is powered from an off - board , electric power supply via a flexible tether - although a new version promises to remove this .			1

has even been taught to perform karate moves
