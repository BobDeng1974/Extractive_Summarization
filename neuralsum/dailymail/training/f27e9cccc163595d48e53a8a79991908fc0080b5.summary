by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 ’s tone was polite but firm as he came off court on thursday night and discussed the eternal irritant of the time players take between points			1
no names were mentioned , but he made it clear he feels umpires need to be more consistent in applying the rule which says that , at @entity12 , only 20 seconds should be taken from one rally ending to another beginning			2
@entity15 had complained about the leisurely pace of play from @entity18			1
the @entity19 is the player most associated with an issue that refuses to go away			2
it is only one of three areas in which players are breaking or stretching the regulations , and tennis officialdom is usually too weak to clamp down			1
irritated : @entity3 believes umpires need to clamp down on players taking too much time between points the others are toilet breaks taken between sets — a spurious practice now out of control — and grunting or yelping , which is not only a turn - off for audiences but sometimes a contravention of the general ‘ hindrance ’ rule			1
the application of regulations can be confusing			2
smash your racket — an inanimate object — in frustration and you get fined			0
at @entity48 , wearing an item of clothing that is not white is almost a hanging offence			0
yet do something that is contrary to the letter or the spirit of the rules which gives you an edge and nobody does much about it			0
let ’s revisit what @entity3 said at this year ’s @entity60 after losing to @entity18 in the semi-final			1
‘ i ’m not complaining much about the time but i ’ve played him 33 times and he ’s got two point penalties , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ we should all be judged the same way , not just a guy on @entity69 who you can give a time violation to just because you can			1
on @entity73 they ’re always going to be afraid to take those decisions			0
i do n’t want to complain all the time			1
i just hope they do their job correctly			0
’ he clearly feels that , on this issue , some are more equal than others			0
a recent , high - profile instance came in the women ’s @entity83 final , where @entity85 continually stalled her less experienced opponent @entity86			0
waiting game : @entity18 has a habit of taking his time while between points rules : players are not allowed to do anything that causes a ¿ hindrance ¿ to their opponents only after two hours and 24 minutes did umpire @entity96 summon up the courage to issue a warning			1
grunting or yelping is a greyer area , as some players — men and women — subconsciously resort to this when under extreme pressure			1
yet there are those who use it as an established technique			0
@entity108 @entity107 , who hollers a lingering cry of something like ‘ @entity111 ! ’ every time she hits the ball , is the worst offender			1
opponents do not like to complain as they fear showing weakness , yet this practice is surely a ‘ hindrance ’ to the large majority of players			2
hurry it up : @entity15 ( above ) complained about the leisurely pace of play @entity18 on thursday time between points : 20 seconds allowed at @entity12 , 25 seconds on regular tour events			1
serial offenders include : @entity18 , @entity126 , @entity85			1
solution : introduce a hard and fast 25 - second rule across the whole sport backed by a shot clock if necessary , with umpire discretion after long rallies			0
grunting / yelping : players are not allowed to do anything that causes a ‘ hindrance ’ to their opponents			2
serial offenders include : @entity107 , @entity85 , @entity137 , @entity138			0
solution : declare that , from 18 months hence , making a repeat noise on every shot is outlawed			0
spurious comfort breaks : visiting the toilet is allowed for genuine need , but is now nothing more than a commonplace tactic			0
serial offenders : too many to mention			0
solution : allow three bathroom breaks per season and thereafter charge donations to tour charities for each break taken			0
@entity154 , @entity156 ’s former world no 5 , chuckled on friday when asked about loo breaks , which most players assume as a right should they need to compose themselves or stall an opponent ’s momentum			2
‘ i never once needed to go and i ca n’t remember other players doing it , either , ’ she said			2
how about this as a solution — allow players three bathroom breaks per season and after that ask them to contribute $ 3,000 to charity every time they ‘ need ’ to go .			1

@entity3 has discussed the irritation of players taking too much time between points
@entity176 star wants players to ' all be judged the same way '
@entity18 is one of the worst *culprits* for time *wasting*
