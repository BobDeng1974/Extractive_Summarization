a new report by the @entity1 found that a terrorist attack or foiled encounter has taken place every 34 days in the @entity5 since 2009 while recent attacks in @entity8 and @entity9 dominate the headlines , a new report has found that domestic terrorism by ' lone wolf ' assailants is on the rise			1
a terrorist attack or foiled encounter has taken place , on average , every 34 days in the @entity5 since 2009 , according to a study released today by the @entity1			1
the watchdog group urged the government to pay more attention to domestic terrorist attacks , citing 63 victims in six years from plots carried out by @entity5 extremists , including right - wing radicals and homegrown jihadists			1
@entity27 , the study 's editor , said the report was not ' trying to diminish the very real jihadist threat ' abroad , but rather implored the government to take notice of the dangers at home as well , according to @entity34			1
' we have known since @entity36 murdered 168 people in @entity38 in 1995 that there is a very real and very substantial threat in terms of terrorism from our fellow @entity5 , ' he said			2
the concept of the ' lone wolf ' , defined as a person who carries out a terrorist attack entirely on his own , gained popularity in the 1980s from a violent member of the @entity49			0
@entity50 advocated for radicals to stop acting together in large groups - which only made it easier for them to get caught - and instead called for ' lone wolf action or leaderless resistance ' that involved no more than six men			0
the @entity1 study found that 74 per cent of the 63 incidents examined from april 1 , 2009 , through feburary 1 , 2015 , were carried out or planned by a single person			1
and 90 per cent of the incidents were just the work of one or two people			0
according to the report , lone wolf 's are all the more dangerous because often nobody else knows about their plan for violence			0
this is because homegrown terrorists are hiding themselves ' in the anonymity and safety of the @entity73 ' , @entity27 said			0
chilling : one of the incidents included in the study were the murder of two police officers and a bystander by @entity79 ( left ) and @entity80 ( right ) , a married couple with extreme anti-government views , in @entity82 the 2012 massacre of six people at a @entity87 @entity86 temple by a @entity88 , and the murder of two police officers and a bystander last summer by a @entity82 couple with anti-government views , were two of the incidents included in the study			0
following the recent attacks in @entity9 and @entity8 , the @entity95 will hold a summit next week to discuss countering violent extremism			1
another recent terrorist act included was the massacre of six people at a @entity87 @entity86 temple by @entity103 @entity102 ( pictured ) but @entity27 has concerns the meeting will focus too heavily ' on the threat of @entity108 terrorism '			2
' the government , at least in our view , has fallen down in many ways with respect to dealing with domestic terrorism ' he said			0
@entity116 spokesman @entity115 said the summit will not focus ' on any particular religion , ideology or political movement , ' he wrote in an email to @entity34			0
he said the summit will ' address contemporary challenges ' and attempt to ' draw lessons that are applicable to the full spectrum of violent extremists '			2
a task force dedicated to domestic terrorism was created after the 1995 @entity38 bombing , but it disbanded not long after the september 11 terrorist attacks			1
the @entity132 's team dedicated to @entity134 domestic terrorism similarly fell apart in 2009 after it was heavily criticized for a report stating that right - wing radicalism grew exponentially following the election of @entity138 to office in 2009			2
attorney general @entity140 announced last summer that the task force that disintegrated in 2001 would be revived , although the @entity1 has noted that a meeting has yet to be held			0
the report found that there were two main motivations fueling domestic terrorism			0
almost half of the attacks in the last six years were fueled by anti-government radicals , whereas 51 per cent of the incidents were inspired by ideologies ' of hate ' , including both white supremacy and radical @entity108			1
but after the recent attacks in @entity8 and @entity9 , combined with the ongoing brutality of @entity155 , @entity27 said @entity156 in @entity5 are ' clearly under fire '			1
this week three young @entity5 - born @entity156 students in @entity159 were brutally executed by their neighbor @entity160			2
although the most recent shooting in @entity163 has yet to be ruled a hate crime - police believe it was caused by a parking dispute - @entity27 said he believes the country will only continue to see similar violence			2
' it is very likely to get worse before it gets better			0
' a task force dedicated to domestic terrorism was created after the 1995 @entity38 bombing ( pictured ) , but it disbanded not long after the september 11 terrorist attacks			1
