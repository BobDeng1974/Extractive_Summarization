a court heard @entity9 plead guilty to strangling her husband 82 - year - old @entity10 , who was dying from leukaemia , at their home in @entity14 , @entity15			1
but she insisted that her motive was to end his pain , and must now face a separate hearing to determine if the murder was indeed an act of mercy			1
tragic : the home of @entity9 and her husband @entity10 , who was terminally ill with leukaemia when she strangled him to death there on july 5 last year , before telling police she had done so as part of a suicide pact mr @entity31 was found dead on july 5 last year			1
his wife was arrested the same day and told detectives his death was as a result of a suicide pact			0
@entity31 appeared at @entity37 by video link from @entity40 prison , where she is being held on remand			2
after entering her guilty plea she was told there would have to be another hearing to decide if it was indeed a mercy killing			2
guards patrol the women 's wing of @entity40 prison , where @entity31 is being held on remand until she can be sentenced following another hearing @entity53 , prosecuting , told @entity37 : ' the issue that arises in this case is whether she believed this killing was an act of mercy			1
' @entity60 , defending , said : ' the only matter is whether he asked her to do what she then did to him			0
' mr @entity31 was terminally ill with leukemia when his wife of 50 years strangled him to death at their home in the @entity70 area of @entity14			0
@entity71 , a @entity73 - derived term meaning ' good death ' , is where a patients agree to allow another person , usually a doctor , to end their lives			0
it has been the focus of much controversy in recent years			0
although it and assisted suicide have become accepted ways to die in some @entity86 countries and @entity88 states , both practises remain illegal in @entity89			0
judge @entity90 ordered a separate hearing to determine the facts of the case before passing sentence			2
murderers automatically receive a life sentence , but if @entity31 's actions were motivated by mercy it could affect how much of that she must spend in prison before being freed on licence .			1
