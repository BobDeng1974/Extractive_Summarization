detective sergeant @entity9 and sergeant @entity10 , who are accused of ‘ stitching up ’ @entity4 , were told by @entity2 yesterday they will be found guilty of contempt of @entity12 if they refuse			1
mps could , in theory , use their historic power to imprison the pair , though in practice that is highly unlikely			0
denial : detective sergeant @entity9 ( left ) said he did not call @entity19 ' that woman ' and sergeant @entity10 has been subject to 13 complaints the humiliation follows the publication today of a damning report into the police handling of ‘ @entity6 ’			1
mr @entity4 was accused of calling a policeman a ‘ f * * * * * * pleb ’ when he declined to let him cycle through the gates at @entity29			0
the report by the @entity32 effectively accuses police of a conspiracy to cover up the way they lied in a successful bid to force mr @entity4 ’s resignation from the @entity39			1
the bombshell report accuses ‘ mendacious ’ det sgt @entity9 of lying by denying he referred to home secretary @entity19 as ‘ that woman ’			1
it also claims @entity43 lied by saying he had not been involved in disciplinary inquiries in the past – police have now admitted there had been 13 complaints against him			2
the publication lambasts the three chief constables who handled the complaint for a ‘ lack of leadership ’			1
two chief constables were also critcised for failing to launch a disciplinary probe into the conduct of @entity9 and @entity10 , who , together with a third @entity58 representative , @entity57 , were accused of plotting to get @entity4 sacked			1
last night , the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) watchdog ordered a new inquiry into the three policemen			0
in a statement @entity65 chairman @entity64 said : ‘ we were appalled by the evidence given by det sgt @entity9 , @entity43 and inspector @entity57			2
it is now clear @entity9 and @entity10 misled the committee , possibly deliberately			1
in the firing line : chief constables @entity72 , left , @entity73 , centre , and @entity75 are accused of failing to carry out a thorough investigation ‘ we have recalled them to correct the record and if they do not , they will be in prima facie contempt of @entity12			1
’ @entity82 could also be hauled before @entity12 if there was evidence he had misled the committee			2
mr @entity64 added : ‘ instead of being transparent , we have uncovered a process that obstructs the truth			0
if this can happen to a cabinet minister , what hope is there for anyone else ? ’ the @entity2 report follows the row over a meeting last october between mr @entity4 and the @entity58 as he fought to save his @entity39 seat after the incident at the @entity99 gates			0
@entity57 , @entity9 and @entity10 were accused of deliberately misrepresenting what mr @entity4 said at the meeting			1
@entity5 @entity2 claim it played a large part in mr @entity4 losing his job as chief whip days later – and was part of a @entity58 campaign against government cuts in the police force			0
the mps say @entity9 ’s denial when quizzed by mps that he had referred to mrs may as ‘ that woman ’ was ‘ mendacious when he has subsequently informed us the woman referred to must be the home secretary ’			0
forced out : ex-minister @entity4 resigned after the incident at @entity99 @entity9 has apologised in writing to mps – but the committee wants him to say sorry to them in person on tuesday			1
sgt @entity10 is savaged for not owning up to having been the subject of 13 disciplinary complaints when he gave evidence to mps			2
they said : ‘ it is a serious matter to mislead a parliamentary committee			0
’ @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity57 are denounced for their ‘ stubborn and unashamed refusal ’ to apologise to mr @entity4			2
the three chief constables in the firing line are @entity73 ( @entity133 ) , @entity72 ( @entity134 ) and @entity75 ( @entity135 ) who were accused of failing to carry out a thorough investigation			1
‘ there was an absence of leadership by all three chief constables at a critical time , ’ say the @entity2			2
@entity60 deputy chairman @entity142 last night ordered a new misconduct probe by the @entity60 itself into the three @entity58 men			0
she said the ‘ catalogue of irregularities ’ had undermined public confidence			0
she added : ‘ the only investigation that would satisfy the public interest and maintain confidence in the police is an independent one , carried out by the @entity60 ’s own staff , and this is what will now take place			0

@entity9 and @entity10 are accused of ' stitching up ' the ex-minister
would be in contempt of @entity12 if they refuse to say sorry
committee report effectively accuses police of a conspiracy to cover up lies
chief constables were also critcised for not launching a disciplinary probe
