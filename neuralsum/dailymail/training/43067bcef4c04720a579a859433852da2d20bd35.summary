benefit reforms are ‘ morally right ’ @entity1 declared last night as he dismissed the complaints of @entity4 ’s leading @entity3 about welfare cuts as ‘ deeply ’ wrong			1
the prime minister said it is ‘ simply not true ’ to claim , as archbishop @entity8 has , that cuts have removed the traditional safety net for benefits claimants			1
mr @entity1 said the government ’s reforms are giving claimants ‘ new hope and responsibility ’ and insisted it was ‘ right both economically – and morally – to change ’ @entity19 ’s bloated system of state handouts			2
@entity1 hit back at criticism from archbishop @entity8 about the government 's welfare reforms the prime minister argued that encouraging people to work , rather than rely on welfare , is a ‘ social and moral mission in politics today ’			1
allies of work and pensions secretary @entity29 went further , labelling the leader of @entity32 in @entity33 and @entity34 ‘ ill - informed ’ and ‘ out of touch ’ for denouncing changes designed to make work pay			1
another official branded archbishop @entity39 ‘ barmy ’ after he renewed his attack on the @entity41 yesterday			1
the @entity42 complained last week that the ‘ safety net ’ has been removed as a result of the @entity41 ’s welfare savings			1
yesterday , in an interview with @entity48 ’s @entity47 , archbishop @entity39 said : ‘ there are many cases where people are left without benefits			2
‘ the voices that i hear express anger and despair			1
something is going seriously wrong when , in a country as affluent as ours , there are people left in that destitute situation and depend solely on the hand - outs of the charity of food banks			0
’ archbishop @entity39 rejected claims that mr @entity29 ’s reforms – which include capping the amount families can claim at £ 26,000 a year – have a ‘ moral purpose ’			2
he said : ‘ for some it is certainly not working out that way			0
’ allies of work and pensions secretary @entity29 branded the archbishop ' out of touch ' the archbishop then quoted the case of a man on @entity76			0
‘ it ’s quite heart - breaking the way that some of the people are treated , expected to apply for six jobs per week online in order to keep their benefits , ’ he said			2
a senior @entity85 source branded the prelate ‘ barmy ’ for complaining about the new requirements for @entity76			0
‘ the clue is in the title			0
it ’s @entity90 ’s allowance			0
’ in an article for the @entity92 , mr @entity1 defended @entity39 ’ right to denounce government policy since ‘ many of the great political questions of our time are also moral questions ‘			1
but he added : ‘ i respect his view but i also disagree with it deeply			0
’ mr @entity1 pointed out that @entity76 has gone up by £ 6.25 a week since the election			0
he wrote : ‘ let ’s get the facts straight			0
archbishop @entity39 ’ claims that the basic safety net no longer exists are simply not true			1
‘ our long - term economic plan for @entity4 is not just about doing what we can afford , it is also about doing what is right			0
‘ for me the moral case for welfare reform is every bit as important as making the numbers add up : building a country where people are n’t trapped in a cycle of dependency			1
‘ our welfare reforms are about giving new purpose , new opportunity , new hope - and yes , new responsibility to people who had previously been written off			2
’ the prime minister said @entity19 ’s welfare system paid people ‘ astonishing sums ’ in housing benefit and left thousands ‘ forgotten about ’ on @entity131			0
‘ none of these things is defensible			0
and it is right both economically – and morally – to change them			0
‘ whatever your religious or spiritual perspective , i believe very firmly that it is wrong to penalise those who work hard and do the right thing while rewarding those who can work but do n’t			0
’ he concludes : ‘ seeing these reforms through is at the heart of our long - term economic plan – and it is at the heart too of our social and moral mission in politics today			2
’ a source close to mr @entity29 , said : ‘ the archbishop is entitled to his own opinion , but his comments appear remarkably ill informed			1
‘ for a start to say that the ‘ safety net ’ of the welfare state has been eroded when we are currently spending £ 200bn on benefits every year it seems incredibly out of touch			1
’ the source added : ‘ i would think that as a churchman the archbishop would be supportive of the work @entity166 ’s doing - transforming the bloated and broken welfare system we inherited from the last government - and reforming it in order to improve peoples ’ life chances .			1

archbishop complained welfare safety net had been removed by @entity41
@entity1 believes there is a moral case for reforming benefits
archbishop says : ' the voices that i hear express anger and despair '
@entity187 source said : ‘ archbishop 's comments appear remarkably ill - informed '
