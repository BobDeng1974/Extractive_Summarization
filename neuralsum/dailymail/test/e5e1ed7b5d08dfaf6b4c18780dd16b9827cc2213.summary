the company has donated $ 5,000 to the man , and is also donating $ 1 to a @entity32 campaign set up for the man for every rider who enters @entity35 into their app when requesting a car before monday			1
this is all thanks to the work of @entity41 , a college student who started a campaign to help @entity6 after riding in the man 's car			2
' his situation reminded me of the helplessness i felt watching my mother battle ( but beat ) cancer when i was in high school , ' writes @entity41 on the aforementioned @entity32 page he set up for @entity6			2
and in just a few days , the fundraiser has almost reached its $ 95,000 goal			2
@entity56 ( above ) , a college student , started a @entity32 page for @entity6 after meeting him which has almost reached its $ 95,000 goal ' for @entity6 , if we could buy him time , that would be our request , but we ca n’t , ' says @entity41			1
' we can , however , using our relationships and resources help to give him peace — and his family their home - in his final days			0
' it is not just the money either , as @entity69 and @entity41 also seem to have forged a true friendship			0
