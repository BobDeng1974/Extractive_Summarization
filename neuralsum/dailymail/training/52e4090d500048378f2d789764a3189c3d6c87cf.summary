the promise was that once the payout target was reached the pyramid would split into two and the process would start again			1
games co-ordinator @entity47 , 54 , was handed a six - month custodial sentence suspended for two years but whereas committee members behind the scheme pocketed up to £ 92,000 each , almost 90 per cent of their victims lost between £ 3,000 and £ 15,000			1
when the flow of new members dried up the pyramid leaders continued accepting money knowing there was little chance of the scheme ever paying out			2
eleven women aged between 34 and 69 became the first in the @entity39 to be prosecuted for such a scheme , under legislation from the @entity64 from @entity65			1
six of the group were convicted of operating and promoting the scheme , while three others were convicted of promoting the scheme			1
@entity25 co-ordinator @entity18 , 65 , and committee secretary @entity19 , 69 , wept today as they were jailed for six months , while games co-ordinator @entity47 , 54 , was handed a six - month custodial sentence suspended for two years			1
in april last year three were each jailed for nine months after they were convicted of operating and promoting the scam			1
they were @entity76 , 69 , the mastermind of the @entity79 scheme , @entity80 , 69 , the treasurer , and @entity81 , 68 , who organised venues			2
all have now served their sentences and been released			0
other members @entity85 , 34 , admitted promoting the scheme and received a three month jail term suspended for two years and a three month curfew			1
@entity90 , 49 , and @entity91 , 50 , admitted promoting and got four month and four - and - a - half month jail terms respectively , both suspended for two years			2
two others , @entity95 , 33 , and @entity96 , 58 , were cleared of all charges			0
sentencing @entity24 , @entity26 and @entity99 today , judge @entity98 said : ' many people will wonder how so many mature women of good character and unblemished careers got involved in such a large , destructive and socially corrosive illegal investment scheme			2
@entity85 ( left ) , 34 , and @entity90 ( right ) , 49 , were given suspended sentences for their roles in the group ' the sad answer , i regret to give , is one of financial greed , deceit and selfishness overall which in their turn led to a catastrophic loss to a large number of innocent members of the community duped by one of the oldest investment deceptions of all time			2
' you knew no one would join a scheme where there was a risk you could lose			0
' you knew the precise mood and desperation of those who were drawn into the web of this deceitful scheme			0
' he added : ' you did nothing to stop the scheme or protect those very vulnerable , but were solely concerned that you were not personally identified as committee members			1
' this was undoubtedly directed at ordinary members of the public who were encouraged to beg , borrow or steal to get on to the scheme where they could n't lose			2
' @entity142 said none of the women showed remorse for their actions and victims , including nurses , had to take up two jobs after applying for loans to join the scheme			2
@entity5 heard the defendants , all from @entity5 and @entity153 , promoted the scheme through ' pamper ' parties where they would seduce others to join			0
cash promises : an image from the promo material used by the group @entity161 , prosecuting , told the court : ' people were simply lead to believe that by joining they just could n't lose			0
' in these schemes it is always the case that 86 to 88 per cent of all people that get involved always lose their money - people were caught up in these meetings , sometimes 180 people at any one time			2
' the irony is that none of these defendants needed the money from this scheme at all			0
' many of the women who joined borrowed from friends and family and high interest credit because they believed there was no chance of losing			0
' @entity76 , 69 , from @entity184 , @entity153 , was one of the ringleaders of the get - rich - quick scheme during the trials , jurors heard how the scheme operated around pyramid charts			1
each of 15 spaces was filled with a participant who paid £ 3,000 and introduced two friends , who also paid that amount			1
once the chart was filled , the eight people on the bottom of the chart paid their £ 3,000 to the person on the top , called the ' bride '			1
participants collected their winnings at specialist prize - giving pamper parties , where they would be asked a series of simple questions before being handed the £ 24,000			1
a set £ 1,000 fee from the payout was deducted , with £ 600 shared between charities and £ 400 used to pay costs the committee occurred			2
@entity161 , who prosecuted both trials , said potential recruits were invited to the parties at the @entity219 in @entity220 , owned by @entity81			0
the ' champagne evening celebrations ' were attended by up to 300 people , who paid £ 2 entry for games and drinks			0
mobile phone footage recorded at one of the parties showed @entity76 shouting : ' we are gambling in our own homes and that 's what makes it legal			0
' this is @entity81 's home , we have been friends since we were 11 - years - old			0
we are going to do these games , that 's what makes it legal and tax free			0
' after games were played , the winnings were handed over to the brides at the top of their charts in cash - with as much as £ 240,000 handed out in one evening			0
but mr @entity161 said the celebration evenings were a ' commercial practice ' , with the committee holding meetings and entrants writing their names on a signing in book before entering			0
' this was n't a bunch of ladies sitting around playing bridge , ' mr @entity161 said			0
' this was a committee and @entity76 ruled those nights with a rod of iron			0
' ' this was n't a kitchen hobby , this was a scheme that sucked in a lot of people and which worked on the promise of them receiving riches way beyond their initial investment			0
