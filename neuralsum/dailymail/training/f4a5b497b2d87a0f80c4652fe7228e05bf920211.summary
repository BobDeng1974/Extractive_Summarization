despite a criminal inquiry into the detectives themselves , at first nothing was done to examine whether their paymasters knew they were breaking the law			2
the scandal erupted when mps discovered a list of 98 firms who had hired four private eyes jailed last year as part of @entity39 for ‘ blagging ’ private information , or acquiring it on false pretexts			1
despite holding the list , and a vast array of evidence from the trial , @entity16 was accused of failing to investigate any wrongdoing			1
