no one can deny that the job market is bleak for many			1
thousands of unemployed people spend their days tirelessly filling out application forms , composing cover letters , and trying to think of a creative answer to ' what would you say your weaknesses are in the workplace ? ' and after unsuccessfully applying for countless positions , @entity10 had had enough - and spent his last £ 500 on a billboard asking employers to give him a job			1
@entity10 , who lives with his family on the @entity26 , said he wanted to add something extra to his application - and as video cvs are now a popular form of a applying for jobs , decided to go a little bigger			1
he said : ' i thought traditional advertising could work to promote it			2
it 's a very striking image and i thought news outlets would be able to cover it easily			2
' graduate @entity10 is hopeful someone will give him a job now , after creating the website employadam.com , and yesterday posting the billboard and tweeting the image , the would - be producer has watched his campaign for employment go viral in less than 24 hours			1
he said : ' after posting , i had about ten re-tweets in an hour			2
' then my phone exploded , and now i 've had over 7,000 re-tweets			0
' i 'm incredibly humbled that people have seen i 've thought outside the box , and then shared this with others			0
' after graduating this year with a first class honours degree in @entity55 from the @entity56 , the student worked in an arcade , filling the two - pence machines and stacking toys			1
he said : ' i was grateful to have a job , but it 's not something i 'd really like to do			2
' i came up with the idea for the video and billboard about three months ago , and managed to save up £ 500 while working			1
' i called in favours from friends and asked studios , and made the video , and decided to post the billboard in @entity70 , because that 's where most of the jobs are			0

@entity10 said he was forced to come up with the unusual approach after spending six hours a day filling out application forms			1
he said : ' it 's like a job in itself , it 's difficult - you have to tailor your cv to each job , you 're often asked to do a video project - and i only had two interviews after sending off my application			1
' it can be disheartening applying for so many job and not getting anywhere			2
' i have a good degree and relevant work experience , but others have more experience than me , so perhaps i do n't look like the most attractive candidate			0
' i thought this would be a way of showing my personality and my experience			0
' @entity10 , who says his strengths are production , advertising , good taste of mainstream television and a strong knowledge of social media and advertising , says his dream job would be a junior producer			1
he said : ' if i could get that job with an independent production company or broadcaster , i 'd be over the moon			2
' the creative student says after the campaign he has had some emails from companies , but no concrete of a job offer yet - but is hopeful his campaign will persuade someone to give him a chance			1
