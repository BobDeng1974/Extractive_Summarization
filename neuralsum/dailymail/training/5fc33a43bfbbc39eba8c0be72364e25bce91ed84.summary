by @entity0 published : 04:01 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 06:20 est , 25 september 2012 @entity2 has no immediate plans to create an @entity5 app to replace its dumped @entity7 app , the search giant claimed today			0
it had been reported that @entity2 has already submitted an app. however , @entity2 's executive chairman @entity10 denied the claim - but refused to rule out launching an app in the future			1
@entity10 , executive chairman of @entity2 , launches the nexus 7 tablet in @entity16 , telling reporters the firm had not submitted an @entity5 maps app. @entity20 launched its own mapping service earlier this month when it began providing the highly anticipated update to its mobile software platform @entity23 and started selling the @entity5			1
but users have complained that @entity20 's new map service , based on @entity27 navigation equipment and digital map maker @entity30 's data , contains glaring geographical errors and lacks features that made @entity7 so popular			1
' we think it would have been better if they had kept ours , ' @entity10 told a small group of reporters in @entity38			1
' but what do i know ? ' ' what were we going to do , force them not to change their mind ? it 's their call			0
' @entity10 said @entity2 and @entity20 were in constant communication ' at all kinds of levels			1
' but he said any decision on whether @entity7 would be accepted as an application in the @entity53 would have to be made by @entity20			1
' we have not done anything yet , ' he said			0
@entity2 and @entity20 were close partners with the original @entity5 in 2007 and its inclusion of @entity57 and @entity7			1
but the ties between the two have been strained by the rise of @entity2 's @entity62 mobile operating system , now the world 's leading platform for smartphones			0
the @entity66 in @entity67 as it appears in @entity20 's maps			2
the firm has come under fire for some of its 3d photography which has distorted buildings			2
@entity10 said he hoped @entity2 would remain @entity20 's search partner on the @entity5 but said that question was up to @entity20			1
' i 'm not doing any predictions			0
we want them to be our partner			0
i 'm not going to speculate at all what they 're going to do			0
' they can answer that question as they see fit , ' he said			0
@entity2 provides @entity62 free of charge and allows developers to add applications on an open basis , betting that by cultivating a bigger pool of users - now at over 500 million globally - it can make more money by providing search functions and selling advertising			0
' @entity20 is the exception , and the @entity62 system is the common model , which is why our market share is so much higher , ' @entity10 said , adding that success was often ignored by the media , which he said was ' obsessed with @entity20 's marketing events and @entity20 's branding			1
' that 's great for @entity20 but the numbers are on our side , " he said			2
at one point , @entity10 , who was in @entity16 to announce the launch of @entity2 's @entity112 tablet here , used the device to show off a new function of @entity7			2
the feature allows users to shift their view of an area by moving the device in the air without touching the screen , similar to the effect of looking around			0
' take that @entity20 , ' he said , adding quickly , ' that was a joke by the way			2

chairman @entity10 says firm ' has not done anything yet '
admits decision would *ultimately* be made by @entity20
