@entity0 says he takes work with him on holiday by @entity4 published : 08:54 est , 18 august 2013 updated : 03:00 est , 19 august 2013 @entity5 has taken his family on a third holiday of the summer – to a hideaway on the remote @entity10 island of @entity11			1
the prime minister spent a long weekend at a sprawling 20,000 - acre estate owned by his wife @entity14 ’s stepfather @entity15			1
the remote home is reachable only by a 20 - minute ferry ride , making it an ideal location for a spot of downtime away from prying eyes			2
with a population of just 200 ( as well as 4,000 deer ) , it is famous for malt whisky , stunning views , pristine beaches – and unpredictable weather			2
@entity5 is on his third summer break			1
the prime minister and his wife @entity14 are pictured at a market in @entity33 , on the southwestern coast of @entity35 , in june the picturesque island of @entity11 , where @entity38 's stepfather owns a large estate unfortunately for the pm , his wife and their three children , they had to endure spells of heavy rain			1
the family are due to head south from the @entity46 today to a fourth holiday destination – their now - traditional summer break in @entity50			1
daughter @entity51 was born there in 2010 when mrs @entity38 went into labour unexpectedly and they are likely to spend the rest of the week enjoying the outdoor life away from @entity58			2
perhaps with an eye on his image , mr @entity5 is remaining in the @entity61 for his august ‘ staycation ’			1
@entity5 and his wife take a drink by a beach during their holiday on the @entity70 @entity69 island of @entity71 , @entity70 in may the @entity50 break is a traditional feature of the @entity5 summer and daughter @entity51 was born during the family holiday in 2010 when mrs @entity38 went into labour unexpectedly but the family ’s other two summer trips have both been to @entity79			1
with the @entity81 improving in the polls , the holidays have been coming thick and fast in 2013			2
at the end of may mr @entity5 and his family took an @entity86 flight for a week - long holiday in @entity71 where mrs @entity38 is said to enjoy the nightclub music scene			1
they stayed in a villa which comes with staff and can be rented for up to £ 11,000 a week			2
then last month the holiday tour of @entity79 moved on to another popular hotspot ... the @entity96 region of @entity35			2
they took another budget airline flight to @entity99 and enjoyed two weeks in @entity33			2
by @entity100 the solitude and the silence were as seductive as the view			2
i was standing on the cliff top at the northern tip of @entity11 , staring across at rocky @entity107 and @entity108 in one direction and down the strait to the @entity112 whirlpool that almost drowned the writer @entity113 66 years ago			1
to get here we ’d crawled and bumped for miles across heather , bracken , bog and streams in an eight - wheeled all - terrain vehicle , glimpsing some of the island ’s deer – 20 times more plentiful than @entity11 ’s 200 human settlers , though still hard to spot in an area twice the size of @entity125			1
buzzards and eagles mewl overhead , adders slither beneath your feet , a wilderness to lose yourself in			2
magnificent : the view of @entity134 on @entity11 during a rare gap in the clouds we picnicked in a bothy on the beach where , in 1674 , the @entity139 of @entity11 and the @entity140 of @entity108 hacked each other to death			1
and we felt as cut off from the modern world as it is possible to be			2
there was blue sky ( for now – clouds on the way ) , bright sun ( but rain on the way ) , a cutting wind , of course – that ’s how it is in the @entity156			0
changeable , like the economy , like politics			0
there ’s a sureness about the sun in @entity162 and the @entity96 , other holiday destinations favoured by @entity5			1
but perhaps his fleeting love affair with remote @entity11 is because its uncertainties and vagaries are more down - to - earth , more real			1
i say fleeting because his visit to the island where his in - laws have a holiday home was short , just a weekend before he ’s off to crowded @entity50			1
@entity5 often waxes lyrical about the island			1
‘ i fish and try to catch the odd sea trout or mackerel , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s a wonderful place			0
i do n’t mind cold water and there are really beautiful beaches up there			0
’ peaceful : @entity184 on the @entity11 where prime minister @entity5 spends his holidays gently shelving into the sea with soft sand dunes behind , those beaches are perfect playgrounds where his three young children can run free , just as my own son did last year			1
but talk about beaches may obscure other activities on @entity11 that the pm is more reluctant to discuss			1
he has gone out of his way to throw off the image of a huntin ’ and shootin ’ type ( the fishin ’ seems not to worry him , though he says he does n’t have the patience for it )			0
he is known , however , to be an expert marksman , and the vast @entity15 estate is prime deerstalking territory			2
it is a pursuit the younger @entity5 once relished – though apparently not the raw deer ’s liver that was once put in front of him to eat			1
he has apparently given up stalking – in which individual deer for culling are tracked and then shot – because it sends the wrong political message , but that wo n’t stop tongues wagging			0
the @entity15 estate has also attracted controversy because ownership of the land is registered offshore in the @entity222 – the tax benefits of which for his wife ’s family could also be something of a political embarrassment			1
these issues apart , what troubles me about the pm ’s lightning visit to @entity11 is that , to get the benefit of island life , to drink in its soul - cleansing simplicity ( as well as its renowned single - malt whisky ) , you need to give it time			1
cosy ; inside @entity240 on the @entity11 where @entity5 spends his holidays with his family @entity243 allows you to motor slowly the 30 miles of @entity11 ’s one road , grandly called the @entity245 , as it winds over the craggy hill from the ferry at @entity248 and is often little more than a track with passing places			1
it passes through @entity252 , @entity11 ’s one - shop , one - pub , one - garage town , dominated by its distillery			1
then it crawls along the west coast before petering out well short of @entity113 ’s rented cottage , @entity259 , a place judged remote even by @entity11 ’s extreme standards			1
to the west of that road is nothing but wilderness , mile after mile of it , soggy with water , riddled with lochs and dominated by the @entity274 , three round - topped mountains that climbers , walkers and joggers come from across the world to conquer , all three in one day for the most hardy			0
on the far side of the island , for the few intrepid souls who reach it , there are nothing but raised beaches formed by the retreating glaciers of the ice age and vast caves gouged out over aeons			2
with all that space and rugged countryside , @entity11 is a veritable outdoor gym for the athletically - minded			1
the air is good to breathe and apparently always has been			0
back in 1703 a visitor named @entity292 described @entity11 as ‘ perhaps the wholesomest plot of ground in the isles or continent of @entity10 ’			1
with all that space and rugged countryside , @entity11 is a veritable outdoor gym for the athletically - minded he was impressed by ‘ the long life of the natives and their state of health , to which the height of the hills contributes in large measure by the fresh breezes that come from them to purify the air ’			1
the island has proved good for the soul , too			2
@entity113 made the journey here to write in 1947 , a city dweller drawn by the solitude			0
it took him two days to get from @entity314 , his journey ending with a seven - mile walk from the end of the road			0
the track was so overgrown he had to cut his way through some parts with a scythe			0
once , he went out to sea , misread the tide and wind and was nearly sucked down to his doom in a rowing boat on the @entity112 whirlpool			0
he survived to complete his ‘ @entity332 ’ masterpiece 1984 , a grim perspective on the modern world that was perhaps possible to conjure up only in somewhere so apparently ‘ uncivilised ’			0
‘ on @entity11 , ’ says the author @entity334 , ‘ @entity113 found himself able to think and see differently , roused by the country – harsh , graceful , aerial , marine – that surrounded him			1
’ the solitude of these islands still inspires writers			0
my novelist wife spent two years on neighbouring @entity342			0
‘ i loved the peace , the freedom to live by my own rhythm , ’ she recalls , ‘ as well as the extraordinary beauty			0
’ she is @entity347 and was alone but no one meddled or interfered , except with friendship , bowls of unsurpassed scotch broth and a dram			0
as far as local people were concerned , she was just the writer who lived in the old gamekeeper ’s cottage			0
it was a relief to be away from urban living to something altogether simpler			0
there is a magic that draws some people – us included , as often as possible – back to our @entity156 haunts			0
it ’s not for everyone			0
the insularity can turn in on itself , the very remoteness a curse rather than a blessing			0
most islanders will confess to cabin fever at some stage or another			0
but generally those who grew up on the islands or have been bitten by the bug return to the tranquillity , the cosiness , the sense of purpose			0
island life is not idyllic			2
it can be pretty hard at times , with driving rain and cold winds in the winter , and plagues of midges descending on any patch of bare skin in the summer			0
yet the benefits outweigh the drawbacks			0
‘ it moved me , saddened me , engaged my imagination and touched my spirit ’ was how my wife put it			0
you do n’t get that from a fleeting visit , mr @entity5 .			1

mr @entity5 is on the island of @entity11 in @entity10 on a 20,000 acre estate
this week he will head @entity50 with his family for yet another trip
@entity0 says he takes work with him on holiday
