@entity1 scientists have confirmed the discovery of a two - headed bull shark foetus - believed to be the world 's first ever			1
the single shark - with two heads - was found in the @entity7 , according to a study by @entity9 and reported in the @entity10			1
it was discovered by a fisherman when he opened the uterus of an adult shark in 2011 , around a year after the deepwater horizon oil spill , in the @entity7			1
it comes after scientists confirmed the discovery of a two - headed bull shark foetus - which at the time was believed to be the world 's first ever			1
it was found in the @entity7 , by a fisherman when he opened the uterus of an adult shark while other species of sharks have been born with two heads - including blue sharks and tope sharks - this is the first record of it in a bull shark			1
bull sharks are one of only a few species of shark that attacks humans , and are also popular with fisherman , as they put up a ' good fight '			1
@entity42 , @entity9 assistant professor of fisheries and wildlife , told the @entity45 : ' they 're hardy little critters			0
' but despite this , the two - headed specimen probably would have died after birth			2
it was near - to - term , but should have been a lot larger – the body looks to have invested so much energy in growing a separate head that the rest of the body was foreshortened			2
' mri scans of the shark revealed two distinct heads , hearts and stomachs			1
the rest of the body then rejoined to form a single tail the condition of having more than one head is known as polycephaly , with two - headedness described specifically by the terms bicephaly or dicephaly			2
but the creatures rarely live beyond a few months			0
each head of a polycephalic animal has its own brain , and they share control of the organs and limbs , though the specific structure of the connections varies			0
such animals often move in a disoriented and dizzy fashion , with the brains ' arguing ' with each other leading some specimens to simply zig - zag without getting anywhere			0
in snakes , each head may attack and even attempt to swallow the other			0
most of the two - headed creatures shortly after birth , and in this case the creature died shortly after it was discovered , mr @entity42 said there were many more cases of two - headed lizards and snakes , because they are often bred in captivity where breeders can observe and monitor the oddities			2
after it was discovered , the shark was taken to the marine science department at @entity102 and then to @entity9 ’s campu where mr @entity42 and his team used magnetic resonance imagining ( @entity106 ) to study it			2
they revealed two distinct heads , hearts and stomachs			1
the rest of the body then rejoined to form a single tail			0
while the professor noted in his research that some may link the deformed shark to exposure to pollutants , to link it to the @entity122 oil spill would be ' unwarranted '			0
he added : ' we simply have no evidence to support that cause or any other			0
' according to the @entity127 , there were 80 instances of unprovoked shark attack against humans in 2012 , with seven deaths .			0
