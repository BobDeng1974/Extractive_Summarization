the phrase like shooting fish in a barrel is well known but shooting fish out of a cannon is perhaps a more unusual idea			0
the @entity7 @entity6 ( @entity8 ) has developed the bizarre cannon to move hatchery and chinook salmon upriver in @entity7			1
the cannon which has been developed by @entity12 has been amusingly nicknamed the ' salmon cannon '			0
in a press release @entity15 ceo @entity14 said the device can move the fish from the weir of the @entity20 up to the riverbank with minimal handling			1
although the device is called a cannon the device does not shoot fish out of it			0
instead the fish are passed along the @entity15 tube and once they reach the end they are put into a truck tanker which brings them to a nearby hatchery			2
fast : the fish are able to travel a distance of 120 feet in approximately five seconds in the @entity15 tube @entity8 personnel load the fish into the salmon cannon as they prepare to transfer them to the truck tanker @entity43 : @entity8 personnel say the process of transfering the fish via the salmon is a big improvement the fish are able to travel a distance of 120 feet in approximately five seconds when they enter the @entity15 tube and it is fast and efficient			1
one of the primary benefits of the @entity15 tube according to @entity8 hatchery reform coordinator @entity53 is that the process eliminates a large amount of stress which previously affected the fish			2
mr @entity53 said the process of moving the fish from the centre of the river to the tanker trucks had been problematic and the new system made the process of moving the fish much easier			0
speed : a fish is loaded into the salmon cannon which despite its name does not fire fish out the other end novel : the salmon cannon is a novel idea which has been met with a groundswell of approval by the @entity8 success : fish enter into the truck tanker after they are transported through the @entity81 tube			1

fish are able to travel a distance of 120 feet in approximately five seconds
*concept* was *adopted* by @entity87
@entity43 has been successfully used to move hatchery and chinook salmon
fish are transported along the @entity20 and into truck tankers
