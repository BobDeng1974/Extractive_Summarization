by @entity0 published : 17:08 est , 17 august 2013 updated : 17:08 est , 17 august 2013 plans by police in @entity3 not to arrest shoplifters who take goods worth less than £ 50 have been scrapped after being branded a ‘ looters ’ charter ’ by shopkeepers			1
police in @entity11 and @entity12 – home to the @entity15 shopping centre , @entity17 ’s worst shoplifting hotspot – said that the radical scheme would allow them to focus on more serious offences			1
officers told businesses and town hall bosses they should deal with low - level crimes themselves rather than calling 999			0
crime hotspot : @entity15 in @entity25 , west @entity3 , where police were planning to drop arrests on small - time shoplifters but representatives of the @entity3 council and retailers reacted with fury			1
@entity33 , deputy leader at @entity11 and @entity34 , said : ‘ anyone who steals is a criminal – full stop			2
they will face the full force of the law in our borough			0
’ conservative mp @entity42 , who sits on the @entity44 , added : ‘ such a policy would be akin to a looters ’ charter			1
’ @entity48 admitted that a sergeant in the borough had made the suggestion during a meeting with council officials and business leaders			2
a pilot scheme was due to take place across @entity11 and @entity12 and would have meant shop assistants and security guards apprehending suspected shoplifters with less than £ 50 worth of goods themselves rather than calling for police assistance			1
vulnerable : the plans meant that shops would be left to deal with their own suspected thieves but the @entity66 insisted this was not official force policy and dismissed the plan as unworkable			0
mr @entity33 added : ‘ we are pleased that the local police have rejected this barmy idea			2
’ in last week ’s report on crime hotspots , we said that @entity75 in @entity76 had a high level of drugs offences			0
in fact , the crimes were recorded at the nearby @entity82 police station , when offenders were arrested and found to have drugs on them			0
we also said an airport in @entity86 had high levels of violence but the offences in fact related to nearby @entity91 .			0

@entity11 and @entity12 police planned not to arrest petty shoplifters
conservative mp @entity42 said it would be ' akin to a looters ’ charter '
