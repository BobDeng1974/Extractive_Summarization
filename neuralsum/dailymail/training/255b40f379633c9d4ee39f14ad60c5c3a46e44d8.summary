@entity2 gipsy @entity1 's refusal to work spurred a crackdown on benefits tourism wrapped up warm for a day out in town , this is the @entity2 gipsy whose refusal to work has spurred a crackdown on benefits tourism			1
@entity1 , 25 , has found herself at the centre of a landmark @entity17 case , which has apparently given @entity18 the green light to block welfare claims from migrants who refuse to work			1
but while the courts – and her own family – insist she must now get a job , @entity22 yesterday declared : ‘ it is unfair ’			1
the @entity27 tracked down @entity22 to a high street apartment in the @entity30 city of @entity31 , 120 miles south of @entity32			1
the newly married mother – whose husband is also unemployed – moved four years ago from @entity35 to @entity31 , where her sister @entity36 had already relocated with her husband and five children			2
@entity22 is a convicted criminal who has never worked a day in her life but has been given a state - funded flat and a range of benefits			1
the @entity17 ruling this week , however , means she can not claim welfare benefits intended for jobseekers because she has made no effort to find employment in @entity30			1
the judgment suggests the @entity18 can , similarly , refuse to pay welfare benefits to migrants who have moved to @entity18 simply to live off the state			1
@entity22 insists she does want to work and is unemployed only because she can not get a work permit			2
speaking as she waited for a tram into the centre of @entity31 , she told the @entity27 : ‘ i came here to babysit for my sister who has five children , but now the children are older i ’m not needed as a babysitter any more			1
i then tried to get a job , but was told i needed a work permit			0
i applied several times but i was never granted one			0
’ @entity22 completed just three years at school in @entity68 , a small town of 20,000 residents close to the @entity71 border in north - west @entity35			2
she has a five - year - old son , @entity72 , whose father is unknown			0
she has no professional training , has never worked , and was sentenced to two years on probation for petty theft while living in @entity35			0
despite living in @entity30 since november 2010 , she can speak only basic @entity30 and can barely read , write or do basic sums			0
her sister , @entity78 , said she was desperate for @entity22 to start supporting herself			0
‘ i wish my sister would get a job			0
i ca n’t bear the situation any more			0
’ the @entity83 ruled that national governments can limit access to jobless benefits work and pensions secretary @entity87 wants to block access to the new @entity89 for migrants @entity22 was apparently given a flat in central @entity31 for her , her husband and her son so she could move out of her sister ’s apartment			1
at the apartment in a smart block above a bank , @entity22 ’s husband said he did not understand what the fuss was about			0
the @entity17 ruling is seen as a boost to the @entity106 ’s welfare reforms and means @entity108 countries do not have to pay jobless @entity108 migrants who emigrate looking to live off state handouts			2
but critics say the case simply shows that not enough is being done to stop migrants emigrating for handouts – because @entity22 is still entitled to other benefits			2
@entity22 receives £ 145 a month in child benefit and £ 105 a month in ‘ maintenance ’ payments , which she will continue to get from the @entity53			0
she also applied for ‘ basic provision ’ benefits worth £ 300 a month to jobseekers			0
the local job centre refused this application so @entity22 appealed to a social court and the case was referred to @entity128			2
this week , the @entity17 court rejected her appeal , declaring that rights of free movement depend on migrants not being an ‘ unreasonable burden ’ to the host country .			1

@entity1 was at the centre of a landmark welfare case this week
@entity17 court ruled that she can not claim @entity30 jobseekers ' benefits as she has not tried find work
ruling may allow @entity18 to block welfare claims for work - *shy* migrants
the @entity27 tracked @entity22 down to her state - funded flat in @entity31 , @entity30
her family have told her to get a job but she declared : ' it is unfair '
convicted criminal moved from @entity35 to @entity30 but has never worked
