buyers : @entity1 , 40 , and his wife @entity2 , 34 snapped up the six - storey townhouse in @entity4 having threatened to leave the country over @entity8 ’s proposed mansion tax , it was perhaps of little surprise when @entity1 put his @entity4 townhouse up for sale			1
far more surprising was the identity of the purchaser of the former football star ’s £ 20million property – himself			1
the six - storey home on the banks of the @entity18 was bought by company @entity19 , which the former @entity21 international , 40 , jointly owns with his wife , interior designer @entity22 , 34			1
it was first listed for sale in october last year for £ 25million			2
the sale included a mews property , where the couple ’s housekeeper lives , which is joined to the main home by a tunnel			2
@entity1 , who has a number of other properties , including a @entity34 mansion , put the @entity4 house on the market just weeks after he blasted the @entity8 ’s mansion tax policy , which he described as a ‘ cheap and easy way to extract money from individuals who have done well			1
’ @entity42 documents suggest the sale was registered on december 5 last year , a day after higher stamp duty levies came into effect			2
it is possible the sale took place shortly before it was registered , in which case it may have avoided the greatly increased charges			0
@entity52 documents reveal that the @entity4 house was registered to company @entity53 however , @entity1 had a mortgage on the house and he has widely referred to it as his own			1
he does not appear to have any other connection to @entity53			0
he has also submitted several planning applications for the house , stretching back over a decade			0
he let it during the @entity61 for £ 75,000 per week and , speaking at the time , mrs @entity22 told @entity63 : ‘ it has an amazing entertaining space on the first floor , with views of the river and @entity68 , which is beautiful when it is lit up at night			0
we have a garden , a mews house – where our housekeeper and family live and which is connected to the main house by a tunnel under the garden , so it is completely secure			0
’ the property also boasts its own lift and gym			2
it has six bedrooms , five bathrooms , a drawing room , library and a 45ft garden			0
it was renovated in 2008 , with mrs @entity22 designing the interior			0
she is the granddaughter of sir @entity89 , who founded @entity90			0
criticising the mansion tax last year , @entity1 told the @entity92 : ‘ over the years i have spent millions in income tax and stamp duty but i am being punished for investing in a property portfolio			1
i see this as a tax on aspiration			0
’ prestigious : the property , pictured , boasts its own lift and has a tunnel to the housekeeper 's mews home view : the six - bedroom home , which also offers a 45ft garden , is on the banks of the @entity18 , pictured @entity109 claims his flagship policy will raise £ 1.2billion a year			1
those in homes worth between £ 2million and £ 3million will pay an extra £ 3,000 a year in tax			2
@entity8 has said those in even more expensive homes will pay still more			2
former @entity115 and @entity116 told @entity117 last month : ‘ with a mansion tax , you ’re taxing me for being prudent			1
‘ you ’ve got death taxes already			0
if @entity8 gets in , i ’d leave			1
i ’d have to say , “ sorry , i want to ship out ”			0
’ he reiterated the opinion in a series of angry tweets in september last year			0
he wrote to his 33,000 followers : ‘ @entity126 ? why should we except this ? @ uklabour are the grim reaper of business entrepreneurs or anyone that has done well ! ’ last night tax experts said the complex ownership arrangements made it difficult to work out what the financial benefit for @entity1 of selling the @entity4 property to his own company would be			1
because @entity8 has not yet detailed its mansion tax plans it was also unclear how the sale might affect @entity1 ’s possible bill under the proposed levy .			1

@entity1 threatened to leave country over @entity8 's proposed mansion tax
so it was of little surprise when 40 - year - old put his townhouse on market
more surprising was that the former footballer bought property himself
