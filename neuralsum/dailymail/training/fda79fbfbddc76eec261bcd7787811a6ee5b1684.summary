by @entity0 published : 03:30 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 02:27 est , 4 april 2013 huge pension pot : @entity2 will get nearly £ 400,000 a year from the company when he leaves @entity4 in the summer the man in charge of one of @entity9 's biggest energy firms will receive an annual pension pot of £ 400,000 despite the company being found guilty of ripping off one million customers			1
@entity2 will get the payout worth up to £ 9million after 10 years of working at the helm of @entity4 which has been hit with a £ 10.5million fine following an investigation by energy regulator @entity16			1
@entity2 , chief executive of the company , was paid just over £ 1million last year with a £ 158,000 ' cash incentive ' on top of his basic salary of £ 840,000			1
there have also been calls for the rest of the company ’s management team to be sacked			1
on a day of shame for the power industry , @entity4 was attacked for ‘ failing its customers ’ through ruthless ‘ mis - selling ’ , either on people ’s doorsteps , over the telephone or on the high street			1
hundreds of thousands of new customers were attracted to switch from other suppliers at the height of the racket – which lasted for three years – and many ended up paying higher tariffs			0
while the fine is the largest - ever handed out by @entity16 , it is a tiny fraction of the company ’s profits			2
last year , it made annual pre-tax profits of £ 1.3billion			0
it would be appropriate for the regulator to refer this matter for further investigation by the police			0
’ @entity69 , the energy minister , said he had ‘ rarely seen a worse case of consumers being misled so badly ’			0
@entity16 launched a probe in 2010 amid claims families , pensioners and other victims were encouraged to switch from their energy provider to @entity4 , lured by the prospect of saving money			1
but in fact they were switching to a deal with the company , formerly known as @entity4 , which was ‘ more expensive ’			2
@entity82 and @entity83 , from @entity84 , told how they were left with huge debts after being persuaded to switch to @entity4 by a door - to - door salesman			0
energy watchdog @entity16 said it found ' failures at every stage of the sales process ' across @entity4 's telephone , in - store and doorstep selling activities the couple were told they would make substantial savings but have ended up paying hundreds of pounds extra every year after their tariff more than doubled from £ 61 a month to £ 158			1
mr @entity100 , 83 , described their ordeal as ‘ distressing ’ saying they can no longer afford to go on holiday and have had to cut out all luxuries			0
in another case , a woman , who was paying £ 1,600 a year for her energy bill , was told her bill would drop to £ 1,423			0
in fact , it jumped to £ 1,734			0
@entity111 , senior partner at @entity16 , said : ‘ @entity4 failed its customers , mis - sold to them and undermined trust in the energy supply industry			1
’ @entity16 said @entity4 ’s doorstep sales team was managed by people who ‘ received a commission on sales ’			1
it said they ‘ therefore had a financial interest in not reporting misbehaviour ’			0
yesterday @entity4 said it has written to around 970,000 of its customers who might have been misled into signing up as an energy customer			2
it has set aside a compensation pot of around £ 5million , and has already paid out around £ 400,000			2
the average payout is around £ 65			0
other customers who suspect that they might also have been duped into switching to @entity4 were yesterday urged to get in touch with the company with their grievance			2
@entity4 , based in @entity55 , said it was ‘ deeply regretful ’ of its actions , which @entity16 said began in 2009 and ended in september last year			1
@entity131 , director of policy at @entity133 , said : ‘ this is not a case of one bad apple			0
the problems at @entity4 … represent a fundamental failure			0
’ @entity16 said it had decided against referring the matter to the police because it had not found evidence @entity4 had deliberately intended to mis - sell to its customers			1
@entity142 , the shadow minister for climate change , said : ‘ it would be completely unacceptable for the energy bosses responsible for this scandal to get any kind of bonus when @entity4 announce their financial results later this year			2
’ @entity152 mp @entity151 added : ‘ if i were a shareholder , i would be very surprised if the top management remained in place			0
’ an @entity157 spokesman said the scandal has affected ‘ less than one per cent of @entity157 customers			2
’ unlike the majority of its rivals , @entity4 remains a @entity9 - owned energy giant and is listed on the @entity163 .			1

*millionaire* chief executive will leave this summer with *massive* payout
@entity16 discovers ' *woeful* *catalogue* of failures ' by energy giant
@entity172 promised customers bigger savings than were actually possible
management team in charge at time keep their jobs
@entity4 director *insists* @entity4 is ' one of the @entity9 's best companies '
not a single executive at the firm has been sacked or forced out of @entity4 ,
the man in charge of @entity4 for the last decade will leave this summer with a pension pot of nearly £ 400,000 a year
up to *2,000* of the victims were *shoppers* duped by @entity4 salesmen into signing up to the company under the @entity157 brand
@entity4 is not compensating victims – merely paying them the *difference* between their previous deal and the new rip - off rate
tories said the scandal was an ‘ *embarrassment* ’ for @entity59 leader @entity206 who publicly *praised* @entity4 in the past
@entity4 was accused of ‘ *obstructing* ’ the investigation by *contesting* every *allegation* against it
