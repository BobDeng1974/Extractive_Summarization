collapse : a house in @entity9 , @entity10 has partially fallen after a night of heavy rain search : a rescue team and sniffer dog have attended the scene looking for a missing resident her children , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , had not heard from her since she went to bed at 7pm on thursday after a long journey			1
they had clung to the faint hope she was alive until authorities told them last night they had found mrs @entity6 ’s body in the rubble			1
her daughter @entity34 said that the family was ‘ extremely numb ’			2
more than a dozen local residents were forced to evacuate the street over fears more properties were at risk of damage			1
but ms @entity6 , who is in her 60s , could not be found , so a search team with a sniffer dog arrived at the site to investigate the possibility she might be trapped within the rubble of the house			1
scenic : but the beautiful landscape in @entity10 was the scene of tragedy today @entity53 said they heard ' windows popping ' at the three - storey property under the pressure of a torrent of surface water which had been washed down the road behind the building , split into three flats			1
@entity64 duty inspector @entity63 said : ' the property and adjoining properties were evacuated this morning , everybody was accounted for			2
' however , one lady has not been accounted for			2
she lives in the ground flat			1
' we 're waiting for a geothermal engineer from the council to come down and assess the scene			2
there was some building work going on at the time			2
' a council spokesman said : ' this is a very tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family and friends of the missing woman			1
' the council is working with the emergency services and the @entity86 to carry out a thorough investigation into the cause of the landslip			2
' unsafe : emergency workers fear a further collapse at the property could endanger the search investigation : emergency workers with the springer spaniel sniffer dog helping them with the search a springer spaniel sniffer dog , used by emergency services to detect the scent of humans , was sent to the edge of the property this morning			1
friend @entity104 described ms @entity6 as ' a happy , lovely lady '			1
she said : ' @entity6 was well - known in the town and was an active volunteer			1
she was a very happy lady , very friendly and smiley , and would always say hello			2
' the whole town has been on tenterhooks waiting for news , and sadly the news that a body has been found is what we had been fearing			0
' i 'd like to thank the emergency services , who have toiled very hard for many hours			0
' this tragedy has hurt the community			0
but the fact that so many people have been offering to help in any way they can is testament to the spirit here			0
' our condolences obviously go out to all those affected			0
' warning : @entity6 had previously expressed fears that her home was in danger of collapsing evacuation : more than a dozen local residents have been forced to leave their homes mr @entity63 said ms @entity6 had returned from a trip yesterday evening			1
he said : ' the woman was away but returned last night at about 6pm			1
there are no other suggestions where she might be - she might be in there			0
' it has been confirmed by her family locally			0
she was last heard from yesterday evening			0
' her neighbours today revealed that ms @entity6 had previously warned officials that her home was at risk from flood damage			1
@entity146 , a hairdresser who lives on the same road , said : ' the lady that has gone missing has complained that she is not happy and has told them that this was going to happen			2
' she has predicted this and it is just terrible because we do n't know where she is or if she is safe			0
' there was a landslip in december and all they did was put cones down , we keep telling them and kept saying this would happen but they would n't listen			0
' the property , named ' @entity164 ' , is one of a number of detached homes along the road , overlooking a sheer drop to the picturesque @entity171 railway line			0
@entity172 , which runs along the entrance to the properties , has been closed to traffic for months after a landslide nearby just before @entity177			2
the road running along the back of the homes , a main road into the coastal town of @entity9 , was said to have been carrying excess surface water which locals said was caused by a combination of heavy rainfall and uncleared drains			1
workers : it is unclear whether the woman is trapped inside or if she earlier left the property retired police officer @entity192 , who phoned the emergency services after being woken by a panicked neighbour in @entity172 shortly before dawn , described how everyone was in a ' state of shock '			2
the 59 - year - old said : ' i got a knock on the door at about 5am from the young man who lives in the top - floor flat			2
' he was obviously in a state of shock and said his house had collapsed and he had to escape			0
' i immediately got dressed and went down to the house with him , but i could see it could collapse at any moment			0
' the windows were popping out and you could see the house was moving			0
' my immediate thought was for the safety of the woman who lives in the bottom flat , but i could n't go in there			1
i thought if i open a door it could collapse and cause her more injury			0
' he said he thought the problem - which has resulted in the stone wall at the front of the property falling away - had been caused by a combination of a build - up of surface water and clogged drains			0
damage : this is not the first landslide on the street in eastern @entity10 where the woman is missing location : the house that collapsed is in @entity9 , near to @entity235 in the eastern part of @entity10 the former @entity238 and @entity239 officer , who is staying with friends nearby after being told he was not allowed to return to his home , said : ' i have been speaking to the council for a long time about this			1
' this is something that could have been avoided			0
i have told the council the drains need clearing but i think we have been treated with absolute disdain			0
' mr @entity192 said he submitted a 65 - page dossier of evidence to the council , warning them of the problem , but that his calls for help have fallen on deaf ears			0
he added : ' this was an accident waiting to happen			0
' many of those evacuated were taken to the @entity264 in the town , although it is understood they have since found alternative accommodation			0
it is believed emergency services had to be called in to remove one elderly woman from her home , who was known as a recluse and did not want to leave the property .			1
