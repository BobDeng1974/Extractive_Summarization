conservationists have launched an online petition to save a 45 - year - old dolphin which they claim is being overworked and unfairly forced to kiss visitors to a marine park			1
@entity6 is one of six dolphins which live at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , north of @entity11			1
only he and one other dolphin were rescued , the other four were born in captivity			0
conservation group @entity14 ( @entity14 ) has gathered 11,200 signatures for its petition which aims to get the @entity17 to look into the conditions of the park - as well as the ' cruel ' treatment the animals are forced to ' endure '			1
@entity6 was rescued at just a year old and has been living at a marine park in @entity9 , @entity10 , ever since @entity14 claims @entity8 does n't have adequate facilities and has ' strong evidence ' that the centre is not complying with its exhibit licence			1
the park denies the claims			0
@entity8 , which was opened in 1970 , has been in conflict with original owner @entity30 since 2004 when he was ' pushed out ' of the management side of the business - but the dispute took a new twist with the launch of the petition			1
critics claim the park 's focus has shifted from rescue and rehabilitation to a ' money making enterprise ' , and say the pools are no longer big enough to house all the marine animals			1
@entity30 , who founded @entity45 in 1970 opened the park as a rescue and rehabilitation centre for marine animals the petition - which has over 11,200 signatures - says : ' at @entity8 dolphins are forced to perform in demeaning shows , swim with and kiss strangers , and even give members of the public ' rides ' on a daily basis			1
' ... not only that , but the size of the dolphin pool falls well short of legal specifications			0
' advocacy director of @entity63 told @entity64 they hope this will push the marine park to realign their focus on caring for unwell animals rather than breeding them in captivity for shows			0
' we were so happy with the public support we got , its calling on the @entity17 to undertake an investigation into @entity8			0
' @entity78 for dolphins have launched a petition against the park - now called @entity8 - claiming the animals are mistreated ' the facilities are not only too small but we have strong evidence to suggest they 're illegal , ' said ms @entity63			1
other concerns include the number of shows that dolphins at the park perform , and the level of interaction they are now required to have with visitors each day			0
' i think is fairly controversial , and this occurs on a daily basis despite the legal standards stating only minimal handling is allowed , ' ms @entity63 said			0
@entity99 , who managed the facility for ten years when it was still the @entity45 , also voiced his concerns about the treatment of the animals			2
mr @entity30 has been battling to regain control of the marine centre and has plans to turn it into a hospital and rescue operation once again ' i do nâ€™t think that the animals have the same freedom as they did when we were there , ' mr @entity99 said , speaking of the period he ran the park alongside mr @entity30			1
' the interaction that they 're doing is to my mind is probably too much			0
' mr @entity30 held the same view , and while he was n't quite as critical as mr @entity99 , said despite the fact that dolphins have a ' natural affinity to become friends with humans ' he believed they were ' overworked '			1
' i do n't agree that three shows a day is necessary , it 's only necessary to make money , ' mr @entity30 told @entity64			2
' ( and ) there 's a heck of a lot more interaction than we had			0
' critics have said @entity6 ( right ) and fellow dolphins are forced to perform three times a day to meet demand however the current ceo of @entity137 disputes these claims , saying the dolphins actually spend less time performing now than they used to			2
ms @entity141 said previous performances called ' @entity144 ' run when mr @entity30 was in charge lasted for over an hour , and ' now they 're only 25 minutes '			1
she denied claims that dolphins were forced to give visitors ' rides ' and said while more people are swimming with the dolphins there are more animals at the park than there used to be			0
however ceo of @entity8 said the animals perform less than they used to and denied anyone rides the dolphins the chief executive also told @entity64 that her park had already been working with the @entity17 to evaluate the measurements of the pools at the facility , as she believes she was misinformed about the size of them when she gained control			1
' to blatantly lie to people ... and get 11,000 signatures on a petition is just a waste of time for everybody involved , ' ms @entity141 said			0
she also revealed that she had been ' fighting this battle ' since she took the reins in 2004 , and while she had no bad words to say about mr @entity30 said she was ' baffled ' by the fact that one of major shareholders is fighting her over the park he founded			2
' i do n't understand why our major shareholder is trying to cause problems , it just baffles me , ' ms @entity141 said			0
there are also concerns about the high level on interaction visitors have with the dolphins despite this mr @entity30 and his team are aiming to take control of the park once again and have big plans to turn the facility into a research centre and hospital for the marine life			2
' we felt that the park had the ultimate potential to be a world leader in teaching people about marine animals , in rescue and rehab , ' mr @entity99 said , before adding he still has such aspirations if he was to regain control of the facility			2
' ( right now ) the park does n't realise its potenial , it has got this very commercial ambition			0

@entity6 the *bottlenose* dolphin was rescued by @entity30 in 1970
mr @entity30 started the @entity45 in @entity9 in the same year

the park has also come under fire for ' forcing ' dolphins to swim with people and kiss them
@entity78 for @entity225 launched a petition to have the park investigated by the @entity17
mr @entity30 and former park manager @entity99 have criticised the treatment of the animals
they claim the focus has moved away from rescue and rehabilitation towards money - making
