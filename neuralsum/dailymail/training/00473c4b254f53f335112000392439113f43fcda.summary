by @entity0 published : 18:38 est , 17 september 2012 updated : 06:20 est , 19 september 2012 she is the grande dame of the catwalk with more pedigree than the rest of the @entity6 designers put together			0
and last night , @entity7 celebrated yet another successful runway show with a packed - to - the - rafters party at @entity10			2
the maverick @entity12 designer invited a circle of friends and industry pals to a dinner at the @entity17 restaurant - the second year running she has chosen @entity10 for her after - show party ... they must be doing something right			2
arrivals : @entity7 with husband @entity24 at @entity10 for her post-show party double act : @entity7 works closely with @entity24 , her former fashion student and husband of 17 years a flock of colourful creatures flooded @entity30 dressed in their finest , filling the restaurant until they spilled out onto the terrace			1
@entity7 , whose @entity34 catwalk show was held at the government 's @entity35 earlier that day , arrived on the arm of husband @entity24 after sitting front row at @entity40 's comeback show at the @entity41			1
but for all her success as a designer , and for all the fashionistas , bloggers , stylists and journalists queuing up to get a bit of @entity7 wisdom , @entity7 , who looked as striking as ever in a dress of her own design , says now she cares little for fashion , using it only as a platform to promote her environmental work			2
flamboyant : the upmarket @entity17 postcode got an injection of colour as hundreds of partygoers joined @entity7 at @entity6 's hottest post-show party fashion fabulous : @entity7 enjoyed @entity66 's menu with friends at @entity10 last night at her show finale she took to the runway in a pair of hot pants and a t - shirt bearing the words @entity74 , a moustache and monacle inked on her face with a marker pen , telling her guests to ' buy less , choose well , make it last			1
at the party , @entity7 's @entity85 warriors roamed the room in bright green costumes , collecting money for her charity			1
guests were left in the expert hands of the restaurant 's new star chef , the irrepressible @entity66 ( how does he keep smiling while serving up 100 covers at once ? ) , who brought out delicate scallop ceviche , burrata with heirloom tomatoes or beef carpaccio , followed by roast cod served with @entity103 vegetables in @entity105 pots or slow - cooked beef with roasted new potatoes			0
it 's all about the glamour : @entity110 gorgeous in sequins , @entity112 cool in hot pants and @entity114 wearing the stunning parrot print scarf dress by @entity116 with necklace by @entity118 pudding - yes , fashionistas do eat pud - was chocolate mousse with a hazelnut twist , strawberry tart or creme brul√©e			0
the soundtrack to the meal was @entity127 - a personal request from @entity7 , who adores classical music - and the atmosphere in the buzzy restaurant , fuelled by a cool crowd ( @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity110 , @entity135 and @entity112 joined in the fun before joining the party downstairs ) plus heady @entity139 vodka cocktails and excited chatter was such that it was past midnight when guests poured through the doors down the red - lit staircase to nightclub salon for a riotous party that went on till the wee hours			1
@entity148 presided over a packed dancefloor ... here are his top three tracks of the night : actress @entity110 , dressed in oh - so - glam sequins , said she had n't made it to enough fashion week shows thanks to her filming schedule for new tv show endeavour - but that she planned to make up for it tonight			0
' i have to be up at 7.30am for work , but i think i may pull an all - nighter in honour of fashion week , ' she said			0
presenter @entity112 , who 'd been busy filming for @entity164 during @entity6 , said she was looking forward to @entity166 's show tomorrow , more so because she was the name behind @entity169 ' wedding dress			0
co-owner and operator @entity170 said it was a ' total pleasure ' to host the @entity7 dinner for a second season at @entity10			2
' we love that we share @entity7 's passion for supporting young , interesting talent and artists at salon too , ' he said			1
the atmosphere was electric , the vibe addictive - to the point that at 3am when sensible @entity6 goers should be tucked up in face masks preparing for the next day 's early start , they were getting their rocks off to @entity148 's set , playing table football or posing for photos with the club 's giant white gorilla statue - which is set to be auctioned off for one of @entity7 's favoured charities @entity194 later this month ( say your goodbyes now )			1
a fitting end to a fabulous day for fashion 's favourite dame			0
