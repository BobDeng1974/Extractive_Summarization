a warming climate may have enabled the earliest humans to venture into @entity3 1.4 million years ago , a new study suggests			1
researchers believe that the spread of our distant human ancestors , the hominins , had been halted by colder and drier temperatures			2
but as conditions warmed , they were able to branch out from @entity11 into @entity12 , and ultimately spread across @entity3			0
@entity12 researchers say climate change impacted human migration			1
until 1.4 million years ago it was too cold to inhabit southeast @entity12			1
but then the climate warmed to 13 ° @entity18 ) and became more humid			1
this enabled hominins ( stock image shown ) - our distant ancestors - to move to new regions the research was led by dr @entity26 from the @entity27 ( @entity27 )			1
published in the @entity29 , the paper suggests climate change affected the amount of resources available			0
there have been various theories put forward over the years about the diet of our early ancestors , but a study from @entity39 published last year claimed to have finally settled the debate			0
an ancient human ancestor known as ‘ @entity42 ’ lived mainly on a diet of tiger nuts , worms and grasshoppers , according to research			0
scientists believe this diet explains why the ancient hominin relative , called @entity51 , which lived in @entity11 between 2.4 and 1.4 million years ago , had such distinctively powerful jaws and large , flat molar teeth			2
the theory is based on analysis of the @entity58 site in the @entity59 in southeast @entity12			2
here , simple @entity62 tools have previously been found , linked to the earliest known hominins 1.4 million years ago , reported @entity63			1
but they were not able to migrate to this region until conditions improved			0
the researchers said that the early @entity69 era ( the era lasted from 2.59 million to 11,700 years ago ) was characterised by colder and drier weather			2
this ‘ possibly impeded the settlement of this region by the early hominin population from the southern @entity75 , ’ the researchers wrote			0
but shortly afterwards , ‘ when the climatic conditions were again favourable , a hominin presence is suddenly evidenced			0
’ the theory is based on analysis of the @entity58 site in the @entity59 in southeast @entity12 , shown by the grey marker on this map			2
here , simple @entity62 tools have previously been found , linked to the earliest known hominins 1.4 million years ago the @entity84 tool technology period - between 700,000 an 300,000 years ago - followed the more primitive @entity62 period			1
tools at the time included large stone hand axes ( stock image shown ) made from flint and quartzite , used to scavenge from carcasses it should be noted that the warming climate referred to here is on a vastly longer time scale than modern climate change			0
at the time 1.4 million years ago , though , temperatures warmed above 13 ° @entity18 ) and humidity increased , allowing hominins to inhabit the region - scavenging carcasses in the region with the help of tools			1
‘ the data reported here clearly support the idea that the early hominin occupation of @entity3 was strongly constrained by climatic and environmental conditions , rather than by physiography or cultural factors , ’ the researchers wrote .			0
