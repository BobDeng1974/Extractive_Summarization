by @entity0 last updated at 5:36 pm on 12th december 2011 an incredibly rare 200 - year - old golden ' doubloon ' has sold for $ 7.4million , one of the highest prices ever paid for a gold coin			2
the ' @entity6 doubloon contains 26.66g of gold and is considered the first @entity9 - made gold coin denominated in dollars			1
its name comes from @entity12 , the goldsmith and neighbour of @entity14 who minted the coin and whose trademark stamp was taken as proof of a coin 's weight and fineness			2
@entity21 : left , the 1787 doubloon is stamped with @entity12 's unique ' @entity24 ' hallmark and is one of only seven ever made and right , a painting by artist @entity27 of the first @entity9 president @entity14 as the @entity30 in @entity31 did not begin striking coins until the 1790s , the doubloon 's huge historical significance saw it sell for the record sum			1
the coin is marked with @entity12 's ' @entity24 ' hallmark , which the highly - regarded goldsmith only stamped on his own coins			0
he mainly struck copper coins from 1787 onwards , but also put his unique stamp on a small number of gold coins			1
it is thought the already - extremely rare coin has even greater significance as records show that only seven golden doubloons were made by @entity12			1
the coins fetched $ 2,415,000 for the @entity49 on wing @entity50 , $ 2,990,000 for the unique @entity49 on @entity51 and $ 690,000 for the rare but less iconic @entity52			0
trademark : the ' @entity24 ' stamp was @entity12 's hallmark when he began minting coins in 1787 @entity56 , the @entity59 - based coin and precious metals company that brokered the deal , said the doubloon was purchased by a @entity63 investment firm			1
identities of the buyer and seller were not disclosed			0
@entity68 about $ 15 ( £ 10 ) when it was minted , the gold value today would be more than $ 1,500 ( £ 965 )			0
all the other six each have the ' @entity24 ' stamp on the eagle 's wing , whereas the latest coin to sell is the only one with the ' @entity24 ' stamp on the eagle 's breast , which may explain the world record fee			0
the latest auction has smashed the previous record for a similar sale where three varieties of @entity82 doubloons were sold for a combined $ 6.1million in 2005 .			0

1787 coin was one of only seven ever made
