by @entity0 consider two brothers who are identical twins			0
if one goes to space and the other does not , are they still genetically identical ? that ’s what @entity6 will be aiming to discover in march 2015 in a ground - breaking experiment that will for the first time study the impact of space travel on the human body in real time , measuring any changes that occur between the two brothers as they happen			1
living in space is known to have effects on the human body , including decreasing bone mass and causing muscle loss			2
the two will be studied before , during and after the mission to see what effects space travel has on the human body but , as of yet , we ’re not quite sure what it does to the body on a smaller scale			1
for example , it could affect our dna or alter how we age			0
to test out theories , @entity6 is conducting an unprecedented twin experiment			1
in march 2015 @entity6 astronaut @entity20 will join cosmonaut @entity39 on a one - year mission aboard the @entity21 ( @entity21 )			1
the one - year mission is in itself interesting , as it will be the first time two humans have stayed aboard the @entity21 continuously for this period of time with missions to date lasting just six months			1
however , it is not the longevity of the mission that makes it interesting – while @entity20 is in space his identical twin brother @entity22 , a retired @entity6 astronaut , will remain on the ground as a ‘ control ’ in the experiment			1
@entity20 will spend a year orbiting @entity23 at 17,000 miles ( 27,000 km ) per hour while @entity22 remains on @entity23			1
@entity20 's one - year mission on the @entity21 with @entity57 cosmonaut @entity56 will be the first long - duration stay on the station , with previous missions lasting only six months ‘ we will be taking samples and making measurements of the twins before , during and after the one - year mission , ’ says @entity61 of @entity6 ’s @entity62 at the @entity63			1
for the first time @entity6 will be able to monitor ‘ two individuals who are genetically identical			1
’ @entity6 recently announced the selection of ten research proposals to study the twins ’ genetics , biochemistry , vision , cognition and more			2
‘ each proposal is fascinating and could be a feature - length story of its own , ’ says @entity61			0
‘ we already known that the human immune system changes in space			0
‘ it ’s not as strong as it is on the ground			0
‘ in one of the experiments , @entity22 and @entity20 will be given identical flu vaccines , and we will study how their immune systems react			2
’ @entity20 ( left ) is a current @entity6 astronaut with three previous missions under his belt , two aboard the @entity91 and one on the @entity21 @entity93 ( right ) , now retired , flew on four @entity91 missions @entity20 's previous mission to the @entity21 was from 25 september 2010 to 16 march 2011			1
here he 's pictured in the unity module playing with fruit in the weightless environment of the station @entity93 peers out of the window of @entity101 in may 2011			0
around his neck is the ring of his wife , @entity104 , a former @entity105 politician who was recovering from a gunshot would at the time after a failed assassination attempt another experiment will delve into whether humans age differently in orbit			2
on @entity23 , the loss of telomeres from human dna has been linked to aging			2
this loss might be accelerated by cosmic rays			0
comparing the twins ’ telomeres will reveal if space travel is causing astronauts to age quicker			1
among the other proposals will be experiments to monitor how vision is affected by space travel , while researchers will also delve into the psychological effects of being in space			1
the research , according to @entity6 , could provide vital data with a view to one day sending astronauts to more distant destinations in space			2
the ‘ twin paradox ’ is a thought experiment proposed by @entity136 in the early @entity137			2
it is derived from his theory of special relativity			0
@entity136 suggests that the faster you travel , the slower you move through time			0
if one twin travelled in a spaceship near the speed of light , they would return home considerably younger than their sibling under laws of special relativity			0
known as ‘ time dilation , ’ this was proven in 1971 with the @entity156 experiment			0
atomic clocks were set to the same time and then sent in different directions around the world in separate planes			0
the clocks were found to have ticked differently , proving special relativity .			0

@entity6 will send an identical twin to the @entity21 for a year
his brother will be kept on @entity23 as the ' control ' in the experiment
they will be compared before , during and after the mission
this will enable researchers to study the effects of space travel on humans
the ground - breaking experiment could reveal how @entity181 is altered
it could also help us determine the effects space travel has on ageing
