by @entity0 published : 11:20 est , 26 november 2013 updated : 12:14 est , 26 november 2013 her rags - to - riches story , complete with a handsome prince , could have been taken straight from the pages of @entity5 but it seems that @entity8 's crown princess @entity7 has n't lost her taste for doing things the ordinary way			0
faced with a wardrobe packed with old clothes , the 40 - year - old chose to dispose of them in the same way as the rest of us - and is currently auctioning them off online			1
but there is one royal twist in the tale : instead of pocketing the proceeds , all of the profit will be turned over to a green charity close to @entity7 's heart according to reports in the @entity29			2
good cause : @entity8 's crown princess @entity7 is auctioning her clothes for an environmental charity fairytale : @entity7 has a rags - to - riches story of her own and was a single mother before her marriage among the goods on sale on @entity39 , the @entity8 answer to @entity41 , are pieces by @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 , as well as high street pieces by @entity48 and @entity49 most popular of the items to sell so far was a pair of @entity53 boots which cost the buyer 2700 @entity55 ( Â£ 273 )			1
unlike the @entity56 , who , after last week 's closet clear out , handed their clothes to the @entity59 to sell , @entity8 's @entity7 appeared to be doing the job herself and even took the opportunity to reveal why she picked an environmental charity			1
writing on the website , @entity7 spoke of the importance of reusing old clothes as she explained her choice of @entity8 charity , @entity68			1
' many of our clothes can be reused rather than discarded , ' she wrote , adding : ' protect the environment in a fun and easy way			0
' state visit : @entity7 joined @entity8 's @entity76 and her husband for a visit to the @entity79 in 2005 popular : since her 2001 marriage to @entity81 , @entity7 has become a respected campaigner the sale is the latest in a long line of charity endeavours undertaken by @entity7 since becoming @entity8 's @entity7 in 2001			2
at the time of her wedding , the princess was the single mother of a four - year - old son named @entity90 , but has since had another two children , princess @entity92 and prince @entity90 with her husband , @entity81 , 40			0
although the run - up to the nuptials were marred by revelations concerning @entity7 's use of recreational drugs during the 1990s , in the years following the wedding , she has become widely respected for her charity work			0
