the source also claimed that checks on the size of the tax amount owed by the @entity14 makers is under way and said that the @entity3 subsidiary of @entity1 booked some of its profit through @entity20 - based subsidiary @entity19 ( @entity21 ) to lower its taxable income in @entity3			1
the new @entity23 : it is alleged that @entity1 , which makes the phones , has avoided paying required taxes in @entity3 but the firm says that it pays all the tax money that it owes , and that checks have showed that it complies with @entity3 tax laws			1
a statement from @entity1 said : ' @entity1 pays every dollar and euro it owes in taxes and we are continuously audited by governments around the world			1
' the @entity3 tax authorities already audited @entity1 @entity3 in 2007 , 2008 and 2009 and confirmed that we were in full compliance with the @entity39 documentation and transparency requirements			1
' we are confident the current review will reach the same conclusion			0
' @entity1 is the latest prominent corporation to become the target of a tax inquiry in @entity3 amid a global crackdown aimed at preventing companies such as @entity47 , @entity48 and others from avoiding taxes			1
in crisis - hit @entity3 , tax authorities faced with dwindling revenues have become more aggressive with domestic and multinational companies			2

@entity3 @entity62 ( right ) and @entity54 ( left ) were handed suspended prison sentences over unpaid @entity3 tax			0
they denied any wrongdoing an @entity3 tax source said : ' there is a global process under way and the @entity3 tax authority is one of the most active			0
' in general , the focus is shifting towards multi-nationals that are able to lower their tax base through their international operations			0
' to try to fix public finances , @entity3 's largest ruling party , the center - left pd , has proposed legislation to oblige companies that advertise and sell online in @entity3 to do so only through agencies with a tax presence in @entity3			0
the proposal , dubbed the @entity87 , is meant to combat a tendency by corporations to shift revenue out of @entity3 and into low - tax countries such as @entity92 or @entity20			1
@entity95 investigation in may revealed that @entity1 structured its operations so that the vast majority of its non-us			2
profits are reported in @entity20 , by companies which , through an unusual feature of @entity20 tax law , are not tax resident in that country			1
@entity21 contracts with mainly @entity106 companies to manufacture @entity14 and iphones			0
@entity21 then sells these products to another @entity20 company which resells them to retail subsidiaries in @entity3 and other @entity113 countries			2

low profits in countries like @entity3 mean low tax payments there			0
countries usually consider companies registered on their territory to be tax resident there but @entity20 law allows @entity21 to be tax resident nowhere			2
