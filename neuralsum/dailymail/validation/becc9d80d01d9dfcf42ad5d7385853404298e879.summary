@entity1 manager @entity0 insists it is no major surprise that @entity4 clubs have struggled in @entity5 this season because of the domestic demands of the @entity8			1
the @entity1 were the country 's last hope on the continent before a 5 - 2 loss to @entity13 in @entity5 on thursday night meant they followed @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 in crashing out at the last 16 stage			1
it meant that there were no @entity4 teams in friday 's draw for either the @entity23 or @entity25 quarter - finals for the first time since 1995 , sparking a countrywide debate about the state of the domestic game			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 has highlighted an extensive fixture list behind their @entity25 exit however , @entity0 believes it is the competitive nature of the @entity8 , coupled with a lack of a winter break , which is hampering clubs when they face fresher , less - tested teams in @entity38 competitions			1
' i think there are aspects there that make it very , very difficult for an @entity4 club to have success in @entity5 , ' the @entity39 said			2
' if you look at the top leagues in @entity5 most of those have got a little break in the winter			2
i 'm not saying that 's the difference but it can make a big difference in a squad that is playing domestically two cup competitions , when others are playing one cup competition			2
@entity1 's @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 look dejected after @entity13 ran riot @entity1 's @entity63 and @entity64 ( right ) look miserable during the painful defeat on thursday ' we need to understand that our league is the best in world football			1
and when i say the best it 's because if you are at 70 per cent in a game , you 're going to lose it			2
that 's how competitive it is			0
it does n't matter about position in the table and i do n't think the other leagues have that			0
' the top teams that are normally involved in @entity5 can cruise through games and that makes it a lot easier to plan a group of fixtures in a two - to - three - week period			1
that is a big difference and that affects @entity4 clubs			0
' it 's not by coincidence			0
some of the clubs in the @entity23 have been unfortunate , there have been small margins but those small margins could easily be the demands that you face domestically			0
it 's something that clearly has n't been working in our favour			0
' @entity0 and substitute @entity103 remonstrate with the fourth official @entity104 @entity0 's men were ruthlessly eliminated in @entity106 by a display of clinical attacking finishing as the hosts exposed their visitors ' defensive frailties			0
but while the manner of their exit was disappointing to @entity0 , he took plenty of heart from a campaign which saw them beat @entity119 home and away and take four points off @entity122 in the group stage			1
' it 's started a real thirst to be in that environment again , ' @entity0 added			0
the scoreboard tells its own story as @entity1 were outclassed by @entity13 in @entity129 ' for our younger players , it is the first time they 've been in @entity5 and the way we succeeded in many of those games , going away into different countries and being able to perform has been very important			1
' i do feel that the players in the squad , myself , my staff and the football club as a whole will want more of it			0
it gives you a real desire to push ourselves to become a winning team and have that more often			0
' we 're all disappointed from the result last night but to reach the quarter - finals of this competition is something we last did 30 years ago , that shows you the size of the achievement			2
' @entity13 players celebrate during a rampant display which saw them ease into the quarter - finals			1
