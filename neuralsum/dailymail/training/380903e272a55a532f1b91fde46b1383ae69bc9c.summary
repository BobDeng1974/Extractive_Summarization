by @entity1 reporter last updated at 4:51 pm on 21st june 2011 in a little over two weeks , an era in space travel will come to a close			0
@entity7 's scheduled launch of @entity8 on july 8 will be watched around the world as the @entity11 space agency embarks on the final chapter of its 30 - year shuttle programme			1
officials yesterday began a full dress rehearsal for the launch of mission @entity18 at @entity19 in @entity20			1
the four - strong @entity8 crew landed on the @entity23 runway in t - 38 jets as final mission testing gets underway			1
two weeks to go : @entity7 's scheduled launch of @entity8 on july 8 will be the final chapter of the @entity11 space agency 's 30 - year shuttle programme led by commander @entity29 , the astronauts will partake in the programme 's 135th and final mission			1
commander @entity29 said they are trying to ' savour the moment '			0
this week , the crew will undergo a number of training activities before suiting - up and climbing aboard @entity8 on thursday to start their pre-launch check lists			1
workers at the @entity19 last wednesday filled the shuttle 's fuel tank in a key test ahead of its scheduled launch			1
the test was added after structural problems were found last year on a tank later used for the february launch of sister ship discovery			0
@entity7 reinforced metal supports inside both tanks			0
last week 's test was to verify the @entity8 tank repairs ahead of its lift - off			1
final preparations : astronauts @entity57 , @entity58 , commander @entity29 and @entity59 are raring to go ' it 's very straightforward , ' said launch director @entity61			0
' we fill it up , send the final inspection team out to the pad , they 'll do their walk - down ... and then we 'll get the ' go ' for drain			1
' a week 's worth of x-ray photography followed to ensure that the metal struts withstood the extreme temperatures generated by @entity76 ( 1.89million litres ) of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen inside the tank			0
the test is one of the final milestones before @entity7 launches @entity8 and four astronauts on a supply run to the @entity85 , a 12 - day mission that is set to close out the 30 - year - old @entity11 space shuttle program			1
an @entity89 - built shipping container holding 9,500lbs ( 4,275kg ) of food , clothing , science gear and supplies for the station is due to arrive at the launch pad on thursday and be loaded into the shuttle 's payload bay on friday			2
in addition to the cargo , the shuttle is set to deliver an experiment to demonstrate how satellites can be robotically refuelled in orbit , a potential game - changer in an industry worth more than $ 160billion a year			2
off to a flying start : the four - strong @entity8 crew landed on the @entity23 runway in t - 38 jets as final mission testing gets underway hundreds of communications , weather and other satellites are currently circling @entity114 but none are designed to be refuelled			2
once their fuel is spent , they can no longer reboot themselves or change position and manoeuvre , and they become expensive space junk			0
the @entity123 is a special assignment for @entity125 , the @entity127 - built robot attached to the space station 's 55ft external crane			2
over the next two years , ground controllers will use @entity125 to demonstrate how the robot can handle various tasks associated with fueling a satellite and handling minor repairs			0
@entity7 is retiring its three - ship shuttle fleet due to high operating costs			2
it has hired two commercial companies , @entity136 and @entity137 ( @entity137 ) , to take over cargo deliveries to the station and hopes to do the same for crew transportation within five years			0
until then , the @entity11 will pay @entity141 to taxi astronauts to the station , at a cost of more than $ 50million per person .			0

lift - off from @entity19 is scheduled for july 8
