the belief that the most popular antidepressant drugs raise serotonin levels in the brain is nothing more than a myth , a leading professor of psychiatry has claimed			1
@entity8 , head of psychiatry at the @entity11 psychiatric unit in @entity12 , @entity13 , said the misconception that low levels of serotonin were responsible for depression had become established fact			1
he suggested that the success of so - called @entity21 drugs – which include @entity22 and @entity23 – was based on the ‘ marketing of a myth ’			1
pictured is @entity22 , one commonly prescribed @entity21 the emergence of these serotonin reuptake inhibiting ( @entity21 ) drugs in the late 1980s came after concerns about tranquilliser use to treat depression			1
even though they were weaker than old - style tricyclic antidepressants , they took off because of the idea that @entity21 restored serotonin levels to normal , ‘ a notion that later transmuted into the idea that they remedied a chemical imbalance ’			1
in an editorial in the @entity48 , professor @entity8 said that in the 1990s , no one knew if @entity21 raised or lowered serotonin levels but there was no evidence that treatment corrected anything			1
he said : ‘ for doctors it provided an easy short hand for communication with patients			0
‘ for patients , the idea of correcting an abnormality has a moral force that can be expected to overcome the scruples some might have had about taking a tranquilliser , especially when packaged in the appealing form that distress is not a weakness			2
’ however , other psychiatrists have refuted the professor ’s claims , saying the profession has moved on from a simplistic description of the pills correcting a chemical imbalance			2
they warned the controversy might harm depressed patients if they were deterred from taking the drugs , which had been proved to work in trials and the ‘ real world ’			1
depression should be re-defined as an infectious disease rather than an emotional disorder , argues one scientist			2
the condition could result from a parasitic , bacterial or viral infection and future research into the condition should search for these micro-organisms , argues dr. @entity89 , of @entity90 , @entity91 if his theory is true , he hopes a vaccination to protect against depression could be developed in future			2
writing in the journal @entity96 , dr @entity89 said : ' it is time for an entirely different approach			0
' instead of conceptualising major depression as an emotional disorder , i suggest to re-conceptualise it as some form of an infectious disease			2
' i propose that future research should conduct a concerted search for parasites , bacteria , or viruses that may play a causal role in the etiology of major depression			2
' professor sir @entity113 , president of the @entity114 , said : ‘ that antidepressants are helpful in depression , together with psychological treatments , is established			0
how they do this is not			0
‘ most researchers have long since moved on from the old serotonin model			0
‘ most important of all , ssris are safer if taken in overdose than the older tricyclics			0
‘ people should not change their current medication on the basis of this editorial alone			0
’ @entity128 , the website which advises patients , says : ‘ it would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels , but a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms			1
’ professor @entity8 ’s editorial says it is important to raise questions about the drugs			1
he said : ‘ in other areas of life the products we use , from computers to microwaves , improve year on year , but this is not the case for medicines , where this year ’s treatments may achieve blockbuster sales despite being less effective and less safe than yesterday ’s models			0
‘ the emerging sciences of the brain offer enormous scope to deploy any amount of neurobabble			0
' we need to understand the language we use			0
until then , so long , and thanks for all the serotonin ’ , he concludes			0
professor @entity164 , director of pharmacy and @entity166 and @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 , said : ‘ professor @entity8 makes a forceful but poorly supported argument against something which does n’t and has never really existed : the idea that @entity21 ‘ correct ’ an ‘ imbalance ’ of serotonin in the brain			1
‘ researchers and psychiatrists alike know that @entity21 are effective in a number of disorders but no one is sure exactly how they work			1
their readily demonstrable effect is on serotonin but they have many indirect secondary effects in the brain			0
other psychiatrists warned the controversy might harm depressed patients if they were deterred from taking the drugs , which had been proved to work in trials and the ‘ real world ’ ‘ prof @entity8 fails to mention that @entity21 supplanted earlier tricyclics largely because of their relative safety in overdose , not because of any conspiracy concerning a theory of serotonin ’s involvement in depression			1
’ dr @entity200 , consultant psychiatrist and specialist in @entity202 , said : ‘ in the real world of the clinic , ssris are undeniably effective in treating individuals with major depression			1
' they have become the first line treatment of choice because they have fewer troublesome side - effects than their predecessors , and are safer in overdose			0
‘ @entity8 has previously claimed that @entity21 cause dependence or provoke suicide			1
‘ in so doing he has risked deterring individuals with severe depression from getting the help they need and this latest article just adds to this problem			0
‘ the risk of suicide from untreated depression is much greater than the risk of treating it with antidepressants , and yes , this includes @entity21			2

@entity8 is head of psychiatry at the @entity11 psychiatry unit in @entity12
claims the idea low levels of serotonin causes depression is a *fallacy*
marketing of @entity21 drugs like @entity22 has been ' based on a myth ' , he claims
experts refute his claims saying ' ssris work in the real world of the clinic '
