@entity0 : @entity1 and @entity2 investigated by @entity3 over ' sexist , racist and homophobic ' text messages during time at @entity5 if @entity1 wanted to be rehabilitated , he should have chosen his next chairman more carefully			1
he finds himself back in football alongside an employer who did him no favours on wednesday			0
in 2011 , @entity11 gave a radio interview to @entity13 about the high - profile racism cases involving @entity15 and @entity16			2
asked for his view on black players who take issue with being racially abused on a football pitch , he said : ‘ you know , i think the players who come and complain sometimes , they ’re a little bit out of order			0
’ he added : ‘ if they call somebody black , you ’ve just got to get on with it ’			0
there 's enough dogs in @entity5 for us all to go around			0
' on the arrival of @entity45 international @entity44 ' go on , fat @entity46 like a jew that sees money slipping through his fingers ' on football agent @entity52 ' he 's a snake , a gay snake			0
not to be trusted ' on an official of another club ' not many white faces amongst that lot but worth considering			0
' on a list of potential signings ' i hope she 's looking after your needs			0
i bet you 'd love a bounce on her falsies			0
' on a player 's female agent a picture entitled @entity71 ( where every square was a " @entity74 " square ) sent to members of @entity5 's staff on wednesday @entity11 , now 77 , appeared every bit as out of touch when it came to the issue of his new manager and an exchange of racist , sexist and homophobic text messages and emails that remain the subject of an ongoing @entity3 investigation			1
as out of touch as the @entity87 when they dismissed @entity1 ’s exchanges with @entity2 as ‘ banter ’ , only to then apologise for the original apology			1
@entity11 said @entity1 had been ‘ unlucky ’ and had ‘ done a little bit wrong ’ , adding that the football club had endured ‘ these little problems ’ in the past before finally declaring the @entity3 investigation would probably come to nothing			1
every bit as offensive and patronising was his dismissal of @entity100 , the @entity101 mp who wrote to @entity11 last week echoing her constituents in expressing concern about @entity1 ’s possible appointment			1
‘ she ’s not a @entity101 girl by the way , she was imported into @entity101 from another area , she ’s not a @entity101 lass , so she does n’t understand football , ’ he declared			0
the truth is , no club should have even considered appointing @entity1 while he remains the subject of such a serious investigation ; one that remains two or three weeks away from completion			1
@entity100 ( left ) wrote a letter directly to the club and chairman @entity11 ( right ) about the unrest mp @entity100 sent this letter to @entity101 chairman @entity11 after being contacted about @entity1 @entity1 admitted he has made ' mistakes ' but hopes the @entity101 fans can get behind the team while @entity11 says there is a clause in @entity1 ’s new contract that gives the club the right to take action should he now be charged , he already seems to think no action will be taken			1
@entity11 is being as disingenuous as the man who continues to insist he has already apologised for those text messages and emails			1
during that apology in a staged interview with @entity136 , @entity1 said he was responsible for only three offensive text messages or emails			1
but he did so knowing full well there were more - and the following morning those messages were published on the pages of the @entity142			0
one of them referred to @entity144 , his @entity145 former employer at @entity5 , as ‘ a chink ’			0
@entity34 revealed the exchange of ' racist , homophobic and sexist ' texts and email messages by @entity1 and @entity2 ( right ) while at @entity5 another ridiculed a gay @entity152 season - ticket holder for feeling intimidated by homophobic chants during a match against @entity155			1
@entity1 has not apologised for those messages and until he is asked to explain himself by an independent @entity3 tribunal , it is hard to see him getting any closure on the matter			1
there is a real desire among the @entity3 ’s senior officials to see @entity1 charged even if there remains a major problem over this issue of public and private communication			2
when @entity168 said ‘ the @entity3 does not consider private communication sent with a legitimate expectation of privacy to amount to professional misconduct ’ in reference to the recent @entity174 controversy , he created a problem for the disciplinary officials now examining the @entity1 case			2
but if @entity1 ’s appointment amounted to an embarrassment for @entity182 football , it will be nothing compared to the @entity3 ’s failure to take action against the new manager of @entity101			1
not least because men like @entity11 and @entity1 will feel vindicated if he escapes censure			2
@entity11 ( left ) and @entity1 were excruciating in their analysis of the severity of the latter 's misdemeanours @entity11 said he believes @entity1 is ' the man to lead us back to the @entity194 ' may 2010 : @entity144 is the new owner of @entity5			1
june 2011 : after @entity195 is sacked following a @entity197 play - off semi-final defeat , @entity1 is appointed manager			2
february 2012 : @entity1 leads @entity5 to their first @entity200 final , which they lose to @entity201 on penalties following a 2 - 2 draw after extra time			1
may 2012 : @entity5 lose in the play - off semi-final again , but @entity1 retains his post			1
@entity144 controversially decides that the club ’s shirts should be changed from blue to red and the traditional bluebird emblem swapped for a dragon - causing huge unrest among the @entity5 supporters			2
september 2012 : @entity144 replaces the club ’s chief executive , @entity215 ( left ) , with associate @entity217			0
april 2013 : @entity5 secure promotion to the @entity194 , finishing top of the championship			0
august 2013 : after around £ 35million is spent in preparation for life in the top flight , @entity144 publicly tells @entity1 to ensure there is a positive return on his investment			0
october 2013 : @entity1 ’s head of recruitment , @entity2 , with whom he had worked at @entity152 , is replaced by 23 - year - old @entity229 , reportedly on work experience , although he is unable to take the job on visa grounds			1
december 16 : @entity5 beat @entity233 in the @entity194 and @entity1 suggests to the @entity234 that he will need three players in the january transfer window			2
@entity217 releases a statement on behalf of @entity144 that criticises @entity1 for his comments and asserts that he will not be given ‘ a single penny ’ for transfers			0
december 19 : @entity1 is emailed by @entity144 , informing him to either resign from his position or be sacked			0
december 22 : @entity5 release a club statement that @entity1 will remain as manager ‘ for the foreseeable future ’			2
december 26 : @entity5 lose 3 - 0 at home to @entity247 , as fans stage a protest against @entity144			0
december 27 : @entity1 is eventually dismissed as @entity5 manager .			2

@entity1 was appointed as @entity32 boss on wednesday
the former @entity5 boss is still the subject of an @entity3 investigation into offensive text messages he exchanged with @entity2 while in @entity258
@entity11 is out - of - touch and proved so by patronising @entity101 mp @entity100 , who had *encouraged* the club not to appoint @entity1 as boss
@entity101 chairman said @entity1 had only ' done a little wrong ' on wednesday
@entity1 should have chosen a better chairman if he really did want to rehabilitated following the obscene *revelations* from his text messages
