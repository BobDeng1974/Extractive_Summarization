for @entity1 and @entity2 , the trilogy becomes a quadrilogy			1
already facing each other three times in three competitions at three different venues across the third month of the year , one final blast of beleaguered referee @entity6 ’s whistle at @entity7 ensured yet another instalment of this saga			1
in the movie business , each successive film in a franchise tends to be markedly poorer than its predecessor			0
and as the dust settled on this breathtaking and at times bewildering contest of almost incessant controversy , the suspicion lingered that nothing that lies ahead in march could possibly match this blockbuster for drama , action and utter high farce			0
for on an astonishing @entity28 afternoon on @entity29 , nine - man @entity1 fought to a valiant 1 - 1 draw against their 10 - man visitors			1
this was a game scarred by two early red cards , ultimately three in total , but , in truth , there could have been five			0
one , dished out to the luckless @entity37 , was a monumentally unjust case of mistaken identity			1
@entity41 wheels away to celebrate his equaliser in the 1 - 1 draw with @entity1 @entity2 defender @entity44 ( right ) was sent off after only nine minutes of the @entity28 quarter - final in a case of mistaken identity , the referee also sent off @entity1 's @entity37 adding to the scandal , @entity49 , the @entity1 striker who opened the scoring from the spot after team - mate @entity52 appeared to dive to win a penalty , should not have been on the park at all after kicking out at @entity56			1
the @entity2 captain was , himself , lucky to escape red for a quite awful challenge on the @entity61 forward in the first place			2
and even after all that drama there was still room to plot in a villain - to - hero story , as @entity41 missed a penalty then scored an equaliser to break the heart of outstanding @entity1 keeper @entity70			1
@entity41 ’ beautiful header secured a replay at @entity73 on march 18 – the second of three games in a week between the teams – although the @entity2 striker may now relinquish penalty duties			1
‘ i had the chance to get us back in it with the penalty but he saved it , ’ said @entity41			1
‘ i ’d been practising in training all day yesterday [ saturday ] and never missed a single one			0
i apologised to the fans because i never scored			0
it was my fault and if @entity86 is back in the team next week he will be back on them because he ’s @entity90 penalty taker			0
but if not i will put my hand up to take one because i am always confident			0
‘ their goalie ’s had one of those games , he saved everything we threw at him			0
i hope he ’s not in that form in the final next week or we could be in trouble			0
but it was nice that i picked myself up to score			0
' the referee points to the spot after @entity52 was brought down in the @entity2 box @entity2 keeper @entity105 fails to stop @entity49 from giving @entity1 the lead @entity1 's @entity49 celebrates scoring the opening goal with a penalty the tone for a bizarre afternoon was set on nine minutes when @entity56 went in hard on @entity110			1
he retaliated with a kick towards the @entity2 skipper ’s head			2
in the same melee , @entity114 slid into @entity44 , who appeared to stamp down on the @entity1 man as the pair tangled on the ground			1
and yet , after a three - minute discussion between referee @entity6 and his assistant @entity122 , red cards were issued to @entity44 and , astonishingly , the apparently blameless @entity37 instead of @entity114			1
as he trudged off , @entity37 ’s face was the picture of incredulity			2
this season he has already been banned for two games for allegedly spitting at @entity128 ’s @entity127 – despite his ‘ victim ’ protesting that @entity37 was innocent			2
@entity37 recently insisted he was the victim of unfair treatment from the @entity131 because he elected to play for @entity132 over @entity133			2
that , of course , remains a nonsense but he was right to feel aggrieved			0
as half - time approached , @entity1 nearly took the lead when @entity114 ’s mis - hit shot was diverted past @entity105 by @entity140 but the ball bounced back off the inside of the post and was hacked away to safety			1
then , after a lighting break , @entity2 raced up to the other end and great play from @entity148 saw him cleverly slip the ball in for @entity149			2
the forward was clean through on goal , and took two touches before picking his spot			0
unfortunately for him , however , the spot he chose was the bottom left post and the ball was cleared by @entity1 ’s relieved defence			1
whether or not the ball took a bobble on the pitch , only @entity149 will know , but it looked a real sitter			0
worse was to come for the @entity162 when young @entity52 drove at the @entity2 defence and appeared to throw himself to the ground with @entity149 nearby			0
@entity1 have a second player sent off after @entity166 ( 3rd left ) receives his marching orders @entity41 missed his chance to equalise for @entity2 from the penalty spot it looked a dive but @entity49 did n’t care about that as he ruthlessly cracked his spot kick low and hard beyond the diving @entity105			1
as the teams left the park at half - time @entity176 was furious at the award of the spot kick			0
but it was the @entity183 ’s misplaced clearance into the path of @entity52 that had put his team under pressure in the first place			0
it was a crazy conclusion to the first half but the second period immediately brought fresh madness			0
within three minutes , @entity1 were down to nine men when @entity41 ’ shot struck @entity166 on the arm as the @entity1 defender attempted to block			1
@entity41 caught the ball well but @entity1 goalkeeper @entity70 , so often criticised , pulled off a wonderful save to prevent @entity2 levelling			1
with @entity1 moving to a 5 - 3 - 0 formation , it was like the @entity200 at times but there were great saves to come from @entity70 - from both @entity149 and substitute @entity203			1
@entity41 makes up for his penalty miss by drawing @entity2 level with a header @entity2 captain @entity56 celebrates with @entity41 as the game finishes in a 1 - 1 draw despite the one - way traffic , however , @entity105 had to look lively to stop @entity114 scoring on a rare @entity1 counter			1
just as it looked like @entity2 ’s treble dreams could come unstuck on an unacceptably poor @entity7 pitch , @entity41 gained his redemption			1
running on to @entity148 ’s beautifully - flighted ball , he nodded expertly beyond @entity70			0
from then on in , @entity1 nine men battled valiantly to remain in the hunt for a semi-final spot			2
‘ it will be a tough game at @entity222 against @entity223 or @entity224 , ’ nodded @entity41 after the draw was made			2
‘ either side will make it hard for us - but that ’s only if we get through by finishing the job at @entity73			0
but we know @entity1 will make it tough for us			0
’ at the end of a quite thrilling encounter , @entity1 had sent out a clear message ahead of the sequel , next sunday ’s @entity235 final at @entity222			2

@entity28 quarter - final ended in a 1 - 1 draw at @entity7
referee sent off @entity2 defender @entity44 and @entity1 's @entity37 ( in a case of mistaken identity ) and @entity166
@entity49 opened the scoring for the hosts from the penalty spot
@entity41 missed a penalty before equalising for the @entity251
