@entity1 manager @entity0 is convinced he is the right man to bring long - term success to @entity3 - whether @entity1 are relegated or not			1
@entity0 has overseen just one victory since he was appointed permanent manager in february but four points from games against @entity8 and @entity9 , and a narrow defeat to @entity11 , have revived hopes of survival			1
@entity15 's @entity14 and @entity17 's @entity16 have both been linked with @entity0 's job in the summer but the former @entity20 coach believes it would be unfair for his future to depend on @entity1 avoiding the drop			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 is convinced he is the right man to bring long - term success to @entity3 ' i would n't say i 'm expecting the sack ( if @entity1 are relegated ) but i 've been in the game a long time and you have to be realistic about what generally happens , whether it 's fair or not fair , ' @entity0 said			1
' i 'm going to say it would be unfair because i 'll be shopping in @entity31 instead of @entity32 , i 'll have a different shopping basket			2
' i have to look at it from my personal point of view			0
the club have to do the best for their long term and if it 's not me , i 'd fully support whatever they decided to do			2
but i think it is me			0
' i think the club long - term needs someone like me to have a holistic approach of building the club			0
' @entity0 worked with @entity47 at @entity20 's academy , nurturing the likes of @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 - all of whom have thrived at @entity55 this season			1
rangers have hung their survival hopes on experienced , and often expensive , signings but @entity0 believes he can carry out the club 's wish for a more joined - up strategy			1
the 52 - year - old is a popular and respected man within the game , with aspirations of getting the full - time job ' i think the chairman wants to go that way because we need to keep that stability at the club for the long term , ' @entity0 said			1
' at @entity20 , it took us nearly a decade to get them where they are , where you could churn out player after player after player to have loads more ready to bolster the squad even if they were n't quite ready			0
' at the moment we might only have three or four that could bolster the squad			0
' in order to get that correct development you need to be patient but if you do get it right you set the club up for a long time			0
' reports suggest that @entity0 could link up with friend @entity47 ( left ) at @entity8 in the summer rangers are two points adrift of safety having played a game more than the three teams above them and saturday 's game at home to @entity15 looks crucial given the club 's next two fixtures are away to @entity100 and @entity101			1
@entity0 , however , insists he is not feeling the pressure			1
' i had more sleepless nights at @entity20 , ' @entity0 said			2
' sometimes it 's harder when you 're the number two , you want the number one to do so well and you 're trying your best to help them			2
' at the moment it is just myself and i know exactly what i want			0
' the only thing here is the fans are so fantastic , they have travelled away with us and been brilliant , and i 've had quite good dialogue with the owners			0
@entity15 manager @entity14 has been linked with @entity0 's job in the summer ' it 's not about sleepless nights , it 's more trying to make sure the people around the club have well - deserved success			1
' @entity15 have endured a disappointing second half to the campaign , winning just twice since the turn of the year and slipping to 10th in the table			2
@entity14 , whose contract expires in the summer , is not expected to remain at @entity129 next season but @entity0 issued a warning to @entity15 fans			1
' @entity14 made a comment if he was called @entity134 he 'd get more plaudits and i agree with him , ' @entity0 said			1
' he 'd be called a fantastic tactician			0
they were top half of the table for the first half of the season			0
' if it was the other way round and they 'd only moved into the top half now , they 'd say he 'd been brilliant			0
so it 's only perception			2
' at the end of the day , you have to be careful what you wish for			0
