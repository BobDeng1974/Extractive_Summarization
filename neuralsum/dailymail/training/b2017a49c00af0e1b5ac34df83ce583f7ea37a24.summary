@entity1 rabbis have given approval to the creation of a series of high - rise cemeteries to alleviate the country 's grave yard crasis			1
architects proposed that multi-story ' artificial caves ' would stay within the spirit of @entity12 law while also allowing them to maximise space in such a densely populated country			1
the @entity15 on the outskirts of @entity17 is the main burial ground in the city with 110,000 graves situated in its 150 acres			1
but under the new plan , 30 multi-storey ' caves ' will provide an additional 250,000 graves which should be sufficient for a further 25 years			1
the @entity15 in @entity17 is the first to develop a multi-storey burial ground to cope with @entity1 's grave capacity crisis the new building is one of 30 planned for the cemetery and should provide enough capacity to last a further 25 years the @entity1 government has implemented new rules restricting the purchase of new traditional outdoor graves initially ultra-orthodox @entity12 were sceptical about the project but eventually declared the practice kosher and in accordance with their burial practices			1
@entity40 , the rabbi of the @entity17 burial society , a semiofficial organisation that oversees @entity12 burials , said the new forms of burial have been endorsed by leading @entity47 figures			1
the towers , for instance , have pipes filled with dirt inside their columns so that each layer is still connected to the ground			0
in many ways , @entity40 said the new types of burial represent a return to the @entity59 's ancient origins of burying inside caves and catacombs			0
he said : ' this is an artificial cave			1
once they used to build a cave into a mountain			1
now we are taking these artificial caves and turning them into a mountain			1
' architect @entity69 said : ' the source of all this is that there is simply no room			0
it 's unreasonable that we will live one on top of the other in tall apartment buildings and then die in villas			2
if we have already agreed to live one on top of the other , then we can die one on top of the other			0
' @entity69 said the @entity15 has been his flagship project and has completed the first of the 70 - foot - high buildings			1
he said : ' it takes some getting used to , but it just makes the most sense			0
' the first of the buildings has not yet been completed			2
the @entity1 plan is not unique as there are already vertical cemeteries in @entity92 , pictured , @entity93 and @entity94 due to overcrowding the @entity92 solution , pictured features a series of over-ground crypts where families can visit the space where their loved one is held cemetery overcrowding presents a challenge the world over , particularly in cramped cities and among religions that forbid or discourage cremation			1
the reality of relying on finite land resources to cope with the endless stream of the dying has brought about creative solutions			2
the world 's tallest existing cemetery is the 32 - story high @entity115 in @entity117 , @entity92			1
in @entity119 , the @entity118 is a six - story @entity121 temple where visitors can use a swipe card to have the remains of their loved ones brought to them from vaults on a conveyer belt system			2
versions of stacked cemeteries already exist in some shape or form in places like @entity134 and across @entity135 , in @entity137 's @entity136 , in @entity94 and in the amphitheater - like @entity138 in @entity140			1
but the future will likely look more like the ambitious plan of @entity144 designer @entity143 for an airy cemetery skyscraper that looks almost like a gigantic honeycomb with triangular caverns			2
other plans for cemetery towers have been presented for @entity150 and @entity151			2
in @entity153 , another big project has been proposed : the @entity154 , which will combine a vertical necropolis and an 820 - foot - deep subterranean complex			1
many cities have severe problems with overcrowded cemeteries such as the @entity161 graveyard in @entity150 in @entity165 , the @entity163 cemetery for @entity164 is packed to capacity in the city of more than one million people under @entity12 law , cremation is prohibited so burial space is at a premium such as in the @entity173 in @entity174 , @entity175 the @entity173 dates back to the late 1800s and is predominately used by @entity175 's @entity12 community in @entity94 , @entity178 residents have been provided subsidies to buy space in vertical cemeteries			1
the world 's tallest existing cemetery is the 32 - story high @entity115 in @entity117 , @entity92			1
in @entity119 , the @entity118 is a six - story @entity121 temple where visitors can use a swipe card to have the remains of their loved ones brought to them from vaults on a conveyer belt system			2
but only in @entity1 does the phenomenon appear to be part of a government - backed master plan			1
aside from those who have already purchased their future plots , individual outdoor graves are no longer offered to the families of the more than 35,000 @entity1 who die each year			2
the first space - saving option is to put graves on top of each other - separated by a concrete divider - and have a shared headstone			1
this is common among couples and even whole families , and every new pit dug in @entity1 has room for at least two graves in it			2
the second option is stacking the dead above ground into niches built into walls , a bit like in a morgue , but adorned with headstones			0
the third , and most revolutionary option , is to be buried in a building where each floor resembles a traditional cemetery , without the blue sky above			2
for this upheaval to take off in @entity1 , though , the blessing of the rabbis was needed			0
@entity1 's rabbinical authorities oversee all burials of @entity229			0
the @entity12 burial ritual is based on the passage in @entity232 in which @entity233 banishes @entity234 from the @entity235 : ' for dust you are - and to dust you shall return			2
' @entity12 law stipulates that all bodies be buried separately on a layer of dust and earth			0
@entity244 's burial society even has plans to dig an actual underground cave to find more room for the dead			2
in the @entity251 cemetery in @entity252 , @entity253 , locals have built their own version of the high - rise grave to maximise available space in the @entity258 region of @entity259 , @entity137 , more than half - a - million people live in the spaces between the tombs @entity93 is another country facing a grave capacity crisis which has led to a high - tech solution in @entity119 with one cemetery using a conveyor belt system where relatives can order their ancestor to be delivered from the vaults automatically proponents say the new system is more sustainable , environmentally friendly and user friendly - providing a more comfortable visiting experience			1
but resistance has emerged from a public wary of change			0
in one famous case , a bereaved family threatened a cemetery official that if their loved one was put in a wall they 'd put the official in a wall too			0
@entity285 , a former director - general of @entity1 's @entity286 who put together a report on the country 's burial crisis , said there is no reason for such an emotionally fraught overhaul of an ancient tradition			1
he believes there is enough space in outlying areas , such as the vast @entity297 in southern @entity1 , to build new cemeteries			1
he said technological advances could allow more burials in existing cemeteries , and that the new ' dead cities ' will be expensive to build and maintain			1
but the bottom line , he said , was that people just do n't want to be buried that way			0
' people do n't want to hear about it , ' he said			0
' there is a matter of tradition here			0
people want to be buried like their parents			0
' officials say that those who insist on traditional burial will still have that option ; they 'll just have to drive a little further and pay for it			0
cemeteries , they say , are not designed for the dead but rather for the living who want to visit them			0
the hope is that by attending funerals , people will be exposed to the new system and learn to appreciate its upside			0
either way , burial officials say a growing number of people understand that change is inevitable			0
@entity332 , manager of the @entity244 burial society			0
' we are all in favor of burying in the open field so long as it does not infringe on our lives			0
so if there is no more room to build homes in @entity244 , i prefer burying in layers			0
@entity233 gave us land for living , not for dying			0
' the @entity347 in @entity348 , @entity346 is oneof the most severely overcrowded in the world in @entity134 , pictured , most graves in the city are above ground because of the high water table			1
as soon as a grave is dug in the city it is soon filled with water and if a traditional grave is not reinforced by concrete the body can be pushed above ground			0

@entity362 have backed a scheme to build a series of high - rise cemeteries in @entity17 to cope with a grave crisis
the first 70 - foot - high ' artificial cave ' is *nearing* completion and should have space for 250,000 new graves
30 of the high - rise buildings are planed for the main @entity15 in @entity17 with other similar schemes planned
experts believe the multi-storey cemetery will provide enough capacity for @entity17 for a further *quarter* of a *century*
