' cruel taunt : @entity7 's picture while holding the sign ' this is what a feminist looks like ' was turned into a cruel meme the meme appeared on a @entity34 community page called @entity35 which describes itself as : ' @entity36 and fastest growing page on facebook ! ! ' it also comes with a warning : ' please do n't like our page if you are easily offended or have a hair across your a * * ! otherwise , like our page or nobody will ever like you again			1
' the image was posted on august 19 and has been commented on hundreds of times , ranging from the vulgar and insulting to more supportive remarks			2
@entity52 was awaiting a comment from the page organizer			2
miss @entity7 found out about the meme this week after she was contacted by a stranger on dating website @entity57 who said he had seen her picture online			1
she was sent a link to the meme which revealed it had been shared 2,000 times , had 10,000 likes and 1,000 comments			0
