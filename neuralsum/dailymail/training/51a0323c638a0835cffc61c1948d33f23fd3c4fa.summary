@entity1 supporters are plotting to use the drive to introduce @entity4 votes for @entity4 laws to push through a repeal of the foxhunting ban after the next election a well - placed source in the pro-hunting campaign said : ' hunting is a classic example of the anomaly which allows @entity18 mps to dictate the law in @entity4 and @entity32 on an issue over which they themselves have no say in @entity18 because it is a matter that has been devolved to the @entity35			1
' any move to stop mps from @entity18 , @entity32 and @entity38 from voting on devolved issues in the next parliament would , therefore , make repeal or amendment of the @entity43 in @entity4 and @entity32 much more likely			1
' a strong showing by the @entity45 – whose mps do not vote on @entity4 - only matters on principle – could have a similar effect			0
the move comes as more than 300 hunts and thousands of supporters prepare to ride out today in defiance of the ban , which was pushed through reluctantly by @entity56 as a piece of ' red meat ' to keep his backbenchers on side			2
the figures suggest that if @entity18 mps were allowed to vote then a bid to repeal the ban would fail by a majority of 16 research by the pro-hunting @entity66 suggests that @entity4 and @entity32 mps would vote by a majority of 22 to scrap the ban if a vote were held now			1
the research , based on @entity67 ' public and private indications , suggests that 292 mps in @entity4 and @entity32 are in favour of repealing the law , with only 270 against			2
but the slim majority south of the border is heavily outweighed by overwhelming support for the ban among mps in @entity18 , where hunting was banned separately by the @entity35			2
the @entity66 believes that @entity18 mps would vote to keep the ban by 47 votes to six			1
@entity38 's mps are said to support repeal of the ban by eight votes to five			0

@entity19 's 2004 @entity43 does not apply in @entity18 , where hunting was banned two years earlier			0
a @entity66 spokesman said : ' the promised vote on repeal has not materialised in this @entity35 , largely because of uncertainty about the outcome , with 41 @entity114 effectively vetoing any change in the law in @entity4 and @entity32			1
' @entity18 has its own hunting legislation and there can be no justification for continuing to allow @entity114 to perpetuate the prejudice of the @entity43			0
