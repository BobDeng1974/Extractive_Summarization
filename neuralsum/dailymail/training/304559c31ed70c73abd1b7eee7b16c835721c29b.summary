by @entity0 the influx of @entity3 and @entity4 immigrants has led to a surge in support for @entity7 leaving the @entity8			1
a new survey indicates that 50 per cent of the population would cut the @entity7 ’s ties with @entity12 , with a record low 33 per cent in favour of staying in			1
the 17 per cent margin in a @entity17 poll for @entity18 is one of the biggest gaps in recent ‘ @entity22 ’ @entity8 surveys			1
now half the population wants to cut ties with @entity12			1
in june just one per cent was in favour of leaving it is in stark contrast with a similar poll in june which showed just a one per cent majority in favour of leaving the @entity8 , with 45 in the ‘ out ’ corner and 44 ‘ @entity31 ’			1
significantly , the 33 per cent in the new poll who want to stay in is the lowest ever number polled by @entity17 on the issue			1
three out of ten say the arrival of migrants from @entity3 and @entity4 since the @entity38 has made them more likely to vote to go it alone in a referendum on @entity7 ’s future in @entity42			0
the issue has also led to a revival in the ratings of @entity47 leader @entity46			0
his party is back to 16 per cent , ahead of the @entity50 on 11 per cent , but behind @entity51 on 35 and the conservatives on 31			1
the level of concern sparked by @entity3 and @entity4 migrants is underlined in a league table of 16 voters ’ concerns , ranging from immigration to jobs , welfare and @entity63 independence			0
immigration is way ahead , with 29 per cent saying it was their biggest worry , with the cost of living a distant second on 17 , the economy on 15 , national debt on 13 , and unemployment at eight			1
the chief concern about the impact of @entity3 and @entity4 migrants is how schools will cope with extra children			0
an overwhelming 77 per cent say the strain on schools is their biggest fear			1
the extra cost of welfare handouts and the effect on community tensions come next in the list			0
an increase in begging and a drop in wages for @entity7 workers are not far behind			0
but to some extent , @entity7 workers may have themselves to blame , according to the poll			2
a total of 45 per cent say @entity7 firms who employ @entity3 and @entity4 instead of @entity7 can not be blamed because immigrants work harder			2
intriguingly , the willingness of individuals to employ @entity3 and @entity4 who charge lower rates than their @entity7 counterparts varies sharply , depending on the nature of the work			0
asked if they would use a @entity7 decorator who charged £ 500 or a @entity3 or @entity4 who charged £ 400 , people chose the @entity7 worker			2
they made the same choice presented with a @entity7 baby sitter at £ 8 an hour or a @entity3 or @entity4 for £ 7 an hour			0
but offered a @entity7 car wash for £ 6 or a @entity3 or @entity4 one for £ 5 , they chose the latter			0
the survey also confirms the view of most pundits that fears over immigration are fuelling support for mr @entity46 and his anti-eu @entity47 party , who are poised to inflict a crushing defeat on the @entity123 in may ’s @entity125 elections			2
according to @entity17 , @entity51 will win 32 per cent of votes in the @entity128 elections , @entity47 26 , the @entity123 23 and @entity50 nine			1
however , @entity129 can take some comfort from the indication that he is still more trusted than other party leaders on immigration			0
a total of 31 per cent back his stance , with 29 for mr @entity46 , 26 for @entity136 and 15 for @entity137			2
