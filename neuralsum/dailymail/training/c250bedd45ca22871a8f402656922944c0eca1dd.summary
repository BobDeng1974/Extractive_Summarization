environmental campaigns have maintained for years that sonar systems used by shipping leads to the stranding of whales			1
but now international research has confirmed their concerns for the first time that whales strand themselves on beaches when they are lost and disorientated by high - frequency underwater noise			2
an independent scientific review panel found the systems , mainly used for underwater mapping , were responsible for the mass stranding of 100 melon - headed whales in @entity17 in 2008			1
an independent scientific review panel found that sonar systems , mainly used for underwater mapping , were responsible for the mass stranding of 100 melon - headed whales ( pictured ) in @entity17 in 2008 a recent study by the @entity24 based in @entity25 , said underwater military sonar could be killing blue whales			1
the reserachers said that baleen whale species , which include the world ’s largest animal , the blue whale , react to the mid frequency noises by changing behaviour			0
this includes altering foraging so they miss out on high - quality prey , which could make them weak and decimate numbers through starvation			0
the soundwaves , developed by the military to track enemies beneath the waves , are between 1 and @entity46 , which is within the human hearing band			0
they have been blamed for lethal mass stranding of deep diving toothed whales			1
@entity52 is thought to disrupt the animals ’ diving behaviour so much that they suffer a condition rather like ‘ the bends ’ which human divers can contract if they surface too quickly.this research claims that sonar can significantly disrupt their foraging and dramatically decrease feeding efficiency as undersea noise blocks animals ’ communication			0
teams from the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) and @entity68 ( @entity68 ) were able to rescue some of the whales , but it was too late for many of them			0
while aspects of the stranding in @entity17 remain unknown , the panel concluded that a multi-beam echosounder system , operated intermittently by a survey vessel moving down the shelf - break the day before the event was the most ' plausible and likely behavioral trigger for the animals initially entering the lagoon system			1
' there are now concerns about the impact of noise on marine mammals as the systems are commonly used by many industries			0
a report commissioned by the panel said : ' the potential for behavioural responses and indirect injury or mortality from the use of similar @entity95 [ multi-beam echosounder systems ] should be considered in future environmental assessments , operational planning and regulatory decisions			1
' the noise from the high - frequency sonar systems , used by the military , shipping and research vessels , can cause the animals to swim into the wrong areas , and it is thought that use of the system leads to beachings in the @entity110 too			1
every year 800 whales , dolphins and porpoises are stranded on @entity115 beaches , although it is not known whether sonar systems are to blame			1
here , @entity119 volunteers inspect a with a 44ft sperm whale , which died on @entity122 beach in @entity123 in 2011 every year 800 whales , dolphins and porpoises to be stranded on @entity115 beaches , although it is not known whether sonar systems are to blame			2
dr @entity128 , director of the @entity129 for @entity67 , welcomed the report and said : ' these conclusions add to a mounting body of evidence of the potential impacts of anthropogenic noise on marine mammals			2
' implications go well beyond industry , as these sonar systems are widely used aboard military and research vessels for generating more precise bathymetry ( underwater mapping )			2
' we now hope that these results will be used by industry , regulatory authorities and others to minimise risks and to better protect marine life , especially marine mammal species that are particularly sensitive to increasing ocean noise from human activities			0
' the noise from the high - frequency sonar systems , used by the military , shipping and research vessels , ( pictured is the sound room of @entity158 in @entity159 ) can cause whales to swim into the wrong areas , and it is thought that use of the system leads to beachings in the @entity110 too @entity165 , director of animal rescue at @entity68 said : ' mass stranding response is challenging under the best of circumstances			1
' together with local individuals and the government of @entity17 , we provided the expertise to rescue as many animals as possible and medical care to those that stranded alive			0
' equally important was to gather as much data as possible from the animals to address the root cause of the stranding			0
we are pleased to see the @entity180 report and its conclusions , which will hopefully be used in shaping future conservation policies			0

an independent scientific review panel found sonar was responsible for the mass stranding of 100 melon - headed whales in @entity17
the panel concluded that a multi-beam echosounder system , used by a nearby survey vessel was the most ' plausible and likely behavioural trigger '
the report said the potential for mortality from the use of sonar systems should be considered in future environmental assessments
