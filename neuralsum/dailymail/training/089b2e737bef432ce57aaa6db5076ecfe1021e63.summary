a report by @entity11 cybersecurity firm @entity9 tracked hacking operations in late 2013 and early 2014 that targeted @entity3 opposition fighters , media activists and humanitarian aid workers			1
@entity9 said it was unclear whether the information stolen from the @entity3 opposition had been passed onto the @entity3 government and who the hackers were working for			1
but the hacked material included a detailed opposition military plan for an attack in 2013 on the town of @entity27 , strategically located in southern @entity29 province			1
the town had been under rebel control but was seized by regime troops in may 2013			0

honey traps : hackers stole crucial information from @entity3 rebels by posing as beautiful women ( above ) on social media to steal battle plans and the identity of defectors , a @entity11 security firm has said in a report lured into opening virus : the report by @entity11 cybersecurity firm @entity9 cited this example of a conversation on @entity50 where hackers pose as pro-opposition women to befriend @entity3 rebels then send their victim a photo of themselves loaded with malware that penetrated their personal files and stole information similar tactics were also employed on @entity62 : the method was particularly effective because @entity3 opposition members often share computers , meaning one machine yielded information from multiple victims despite the high - tech tools used in the cyber attack , the hackers relied on a well - worn tactic : the ' honey trap			1
' targets were contacted on the chat and online phone service @entity50 by hackers posing as pro-opposition women			1
they would ask the target whether they were on a smartphone or computer , apparently in a bid to tailor their attacks			0
then they would send their victim a photo of themselves loaded with malware that penetrated their personal files and stole information			1
the method was particularly effective because @entity3 opposition members were often sharing computers , meaning one machine yielded information from multiple victims			2
the material stolen covered extraordinary levels of detail , including the blood types of fighters and the timing of a handover of anti-tank missiles			1
information is power : opposition battle plans were also stolen that included the positions of anti-government forces and , as this map shows , part of an attack plan against an encampment ( rectangle ) of @entity117 's troops hacked : the material stolen covered extraordinary levels of detail , including the blood types of fighters and the timing of a handover of anti-tank missiles as seen in this redacted conversation between two rebels but not all of it related to warfare , with information about refugees , opposition media strategy and the inner workings of opposition political structures also included			1
most of the stolen material was created between may 2013 and december 2013 , though some of it dated back to 2012 and as recently as january 2014			0
the hackers also used other tactics , including creating fake social media accounts and @entity3 opposition websites that encouraged visitors to click on links that would infect their computers			2
the report said : ' the hackers stole a cache of critical documents and @entity50 conversations revealing the @entity3 opposition 's strategy , tactical battle plans , supply needs , and troves of personal information and chat sessions			1
' the hacking provided ' actionable military intelligence for an immediate battlefield advantage ' in the case of the planned @entity27 attack			0
online predators : a graphic showing the number and locations of victims of the honey - trap hackers @entity168 : this translated conversation appears to show an attempt by rebel fighters to secure forged passports as @entity3 often face tough scrutiny when travelling abroad it captured ' the type of insight that can thwart a vital supply route , reveal a planned ambush and identify and track key individuals			2
' @entity9 was unable to identify where the hackers it tracked were based , but it noted that their servers were outside of @entity3 and their tools and tactics differed from previous @entity3 hackers			2
the report 's revelations are just the latest evidence of the stealth cyberwar that has accompanied the fighting in @entity3 's bloody conflict			0
pro-government hackers identifying themselves as the @entity195 have carried out high - profile attacks against the websites and social media accounts of media outlets and politicians			0
and in 2012 , a @entity202 newspaper published what it said were 3,000 emails sent by president @entity117 and his wife , obtained by opposition hackers with the help of a government mole			0
@entity209 , an opposition activist and hacker using a pseudonym , said such examples were rare because the opposition was generally too poorly - equipped and - backed to carry out major hacking operations			2
' we mostly carry out defensive operations , ' he told @entity217 , describing multiple cases where opposition commanders and politicians were targeted by hackers			0
in one case , a commander in northwestern @entity224 province downloaded a file meant to contain military maps , accidentally compromising his computer			0
' the cyber-war is about half the war , without exaggeration , ' @entity209 said .			0
