the married at @entity1 star who once considered leaving her groom at the altar because she was unimpressed with his looks has revealed that she is finally ready to physically consummate their marriage , as her feelings for her new husband continue to grow			1
all three couples began their real journey towards domestic bliss on last night 's episode of the @entity14 reality show , as the newlyweds searched for new homes to call their own , but , surprisingly , it was @entity18 and @entity19 who were brought closer together by process			1
and the two even ended the first day in their new home sharing a bedroom together			2
' now i am looking at him in a sexual way instead of just looking at him like he 's my bud , ' the 30 - year - old said of her new husband			1
' we have n't consummated our marriage yet , but it seems like [ in ] the imminent future that is going to happen , ' she told the cameras coyly			0
@entity18 previously noted that she had n't had sex in two years and she hoped it was like ' riding a bike '			1
the episode began with @entity19 , 29 , who lives in @entity58 , @entity59 , with his mother and his teenage niece @entity61 , traveling over three hours to spend his first night at @entity18 's home in @entity63 , @entity64			1
and despite @entity18 ’s initial reluctance to show any kind of enthusiasm for the marriage , it was clear that the pair had slowly started working towards a mutual feeling of respect – and romance			1
@entity19 could n’t have been more thrilled about seeing his wife ’s abode , admitting that the closer he got to her home , the more excited he became to see his new wife			1
meanwhile , @entity18 was delighted to show @entity19 her home , noting that she sees the potential for their relationship more than ever			1
ca n't do it : @entity19 visited @entity18 's apartment in @entity63 , @entity64 but told her it was too far away from his real estate job in @entity59 major compromise : during dinner , the couple agreed to move to @entity34 because it was the halfway point from their two homes ' i am actually really excited he is coming over			1
i miss @entity19 when he is gone , and it is surprising that i miss him - surprising for me because i do n't really miss anybody , ' she admitted			1
while the couple enjoyed a nice evening together , it quickly became apparent that the commute from the @entity64 location was too far for @entity19 , who works as a real estate agent in @entity59			1
' i would love to make a life together here , but no way , ca n't do it , ' he told her , as @entity18 worried that finding a place to live would become a road block in their relationship			1
later the two met over dinner and agreed to move to @entity34 , @entity35 , because that is the halfway point between their homes			1
@entity18 only requested that she could bring her cat and that there would be parking			2
' this is my new life			0
i am married now , ' she said			0
' this is the first major compromise that we are making			0
' final decision : @entity19 and @entity18 can be seen shaking their realtor 's hand after they agree on their first apartment together hug it out : the newlyweds , who were excited about taking the next step together , embraced in their new kitchen and when it came to budgeting their finances , @entity18 admitted that she has to have money immediately taken out of her check and moved to savings because she is a ' spender ' by nature			1
@entity19 , who proclaimed that he was a saver , made it clear that he wanted to make his new wife happy and he did n't want her to give anything up she enjoyed			2
' do n't sacrifice what makes you happy for the sake of where we are going to live , ' he said of the cost of her dance classes , which she was worried would be too expensive to afford after their move			0
' we will make it work			0
' the two also agreed to split the cost of living in half , so they would both be contributing the same amount			0
after looking at a few places in @entity34 , they agreed on a spacious one bedroom apartment for $ 2,000 a month			1
emotional moment : @entity19 was sad to leave his mother and his teenage niece @entity61 new life together : @entity18 packed up her wardrobe as she prepared to move in with @entity19 ' @entity18 and i are getting close , and i am starting to feel great about this whole experiment , ' @entity19 told the cameras , while @entity18 noted that the pair ' can be really happy ' in their new apartment			1
on moving day , @entity18 received a visit from her sister and her best friend who offered her moral support			2
and while she was packing up her belongings , she revealed to her closest confidants that she is seeing her husband in a whole new light			0
' flying home on the plane , i feel like somebody flipped a switch , ' she said of her recent trip to spend the holidays with her husband			2
' i was looking at him like this is my best friend ever and we 're buddies , and now i am looking at him differently			0
' she went on to tell the cameras that she is now ' looking at him in a sexual way '			0
newlyweds : when they arrived at their new place , @entity19 carried @entity18 over the threshold what to do : the two took a moment to figure out where they should place all of their things ' i am looking at him like a man , ' she added			1
meanwhile , @entity19 got emotional as he said goodbye to his mother and his niece			2
although he maintained that he wanted to be married and move in with @entity18 , he admitted that it was hard to leave his family			2
on the first night in their new apartment , the two unpacked a bit before enjoying a bottle of wine and some pizza			2
' i want to be more touchy and feely with you , ' @entity18 told @entity19 as they cuddled on the couch			1
huge adjustment : @entity220 , 34 , and @entity221 , 35 , can be seen speaking with real estate agent in @entity223 as they searched for a place on the @entity226 not happy : @entity221 , who is from @entity64 , was overwhelmed by how small the apartments in @entity223 were ' what should we do to christen the apartment ? ' @entity19 teased			1
and when @entity18 asked if he meant consummate the marriage , he joked : ' i am a nice catholic boy			2
' but the two eventually made their way to bedroom , leaving viewers wondering if they were finally going to become intimate weeks after their wedding day			0
as for @entity220 , 34 , and @entity221 , 35 , the move seemed to be tearing them apart			0
@entity220 refused to move out of @entity223 , and as she waited for her apartment to be renovated , she and @entity221 looked for a new place that they could stay temporarily			0
but it quickly became apparent that @entity221 , who is an er / trauma nurse from @entity245 , @entity64 , was uncomfortable with city life as he started to pull away from his new wife			2
life decision : the couple finally agreed on a place to stay while @entity220 's apartment gets renovated hear - to - heart : @entity220 told @entity221 that he needs to show her more affection after he started pulling away from her after the two finally agree on a place to stay on the @entity226 , @entity221 continued to be overwhelmed			1
' i can feel myself pulling back			0
we 're not intimate , ' he admitted			0
@entity220 confessed to the cameras that @entity221 's actions made her worry that his distance was about more than just geographical location and adjusting to living in @entity262			0
she finally told him that she needs him to be more affectionate			0
' why am i helping you adapt to @entity223 , if you do n't really want to be here , ' she asked during their heart - to - heart			0
stressed out : @entity268 , 30 , and @entity269 , 29 , learned the bedroom in this apartment is in a completely different unit than the living room and bathroom not our home : @entity268 and @entity19 can be seen having a heated discussion about an apartment they both liked			1
while she thought it was too expensive , @entity19 said that he just wanted to take care of her and make her happy although @entity221 agreed to make more of an effort , he later told her that he had to return to @entity64 for work , leaving her alone in their apartment on what was supposed to be their first night together			1
meanwhile , @entity268 , 30 , and @entity269 , 29 , struggled to figure out where they both should live – and how they should budget for it			0
while @entity19 owns a consulting business in @entity295 , @entity268 , who works as a receptionist in @entity223 , does n't know how to drive , so the two compromised by agreeing to move to @entity298 after visiting numerous apartments , @entity19 believed he found the one , but @entity268 was n't thrilled with the $ 4,000 per month price tag			2
@entity268 could only afford to contribute $ 1,000 towards their rent , and she did n't like the idea of @entity19 covering so much more of the bill			2
team work : after agreeing on a place in @entity298 , @entity19 helped @entity268 pack on their moving day all better : the two kissed in the bedroom of their new apartment in @entity298 ' we need to be able to discuss what we are spending our money on as a married couple , ' she explained			1
' i would rather invest for down the line , if we stay together , to buy something			0
' but @entity19 said that he just wants to see ' @entity321 , ' explaining : ' as a man i want to take care of her '			0
the newlyweds let the apartment go , and they eventually find one that is not only perfect , but it 's in their price range			0
