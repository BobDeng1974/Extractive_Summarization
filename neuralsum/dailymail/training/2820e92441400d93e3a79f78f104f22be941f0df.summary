by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 wants to get shut of a plethora of @entity6 players this week in developments @entity8 could n't have predicted three years ago			1
the @entity10 ' assistant manager is quoted as saying that sir @entity11 would never have allowed a similar demise to that of @entity14 to happen at @entity15			2
in an interview with the @entity17 in 2011 to have resurfaced this week , @entity8 spoke strongly about the long - term vision of @entity11 , applauding his lavish spending on a raft of youngsters			1
@entity30 is attracting interest from @entity32 and @entity33 , while @entity34 could exit should anyone stump up for his wages			0
' our manager is not always looking just for this season , ' said @entity8 in 2011			0
' he buys players with a view to the future , which he 's done more and more over the last few years			0
' he 's bought players like @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity34 and @entity47 - all young players who have got the ability to go on and be better , and all of whom have done that			0
' now we 've got the next batch , the likes of @entity30 , @entity55 and @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 , all young players who will hopefully get better over the next few years			2
' two of the five above - @entity47 , @entity57 and @entity56 - have already sealed moves elsewhere in recent seasons , with the only player certain of a spot in @entity65 's plans being @entity58			1
thanks for coming ! @entity47 ( now at @entity66 ) is just one of @entity11 's signings to have departed the club			1
