' in particular , @entity2 , the youngest , would become synonymous with @entity4 aspiration and style			2
' mr @entity2 told the @entity0 that he cultivated this style as a young child , not out of an interest in fashion , but out of a yearning to fit in at school			1
because he was the youngest of four children , all of his clothes were hand - me - downs - many of which were old - fashioned or not his taste			0
this inspired mr @entity2 to design and create his own clothes			1
he explained : ' when your parents are not able to afford the kind of clothes as a kid growing up , i had to work myself and earn my way and buy my own things			0
i just wanted to look like one of the guys and have the girls look at me			0

' @entity85 beginnings : while mr @entity2 is at the helm of a massive fashion brand today , he started his career by selling ties out of a drawer in the @entity91 mr @entity2 also wore an old suit - a pintstripe style that he continuously comes back to because he finds it comfortable and stylish			1
he explained : ' i can say that i 'm about style , not fashion			0
i 'm about timeless style , about quality , and that does n't mean it has to be boring			0
that means it 's something that continues on because i do n't throw out my clothes			0
' the suit that i 'm wearing is an old suit			0
i did n't just make this suit			0
i like the familiarity in a way because it 's mine			0
' mrs @entity9 and mr @entity2 first joined forces in 1998 , when she was @entity108 , to raise money for the @entity7 to preserve the original ' @entity111 ' flag that inspired the national anthem , along with other historic artifacts , through her @entity114			1
mr @entity2 donated $ 10 million to help restore the flag and another $ 3 million to support the historic preservation program			1

' i started with neckties , which are a very small thing and people are n't even wearing them today			0
