@entity1 skipper @entity0 has insisted he has no designs on the manager 's job with @entity6 's exit imminent			1
the 33 - year - old @entity8 international was an early favourite with the bookmakers when news of @entity13 's approach for @entity6 emerged , although sources on @entity15 were swift to dismiss the speculation			1
now @entity0 has re-affirmed his intention to concentrate on his playing career having first been linked with the post last year when @entity6 found himself under intense pressure			1
@entity0 rises above @entity21 during the 3 - 3 draw at @entity23 on @entity24 @entity0 has been heavily linked with the vacant manger 's job at @entity1 , but insists he is happy playing speaking after his side 's roller - coaster 3 - 3 @entity27 draw with @entity30 on thursday afternoon , he said : ' i am a football player now and want to play for a few years more			1
i want to enjoy being on the pitch			0
' it 's not for now			2
' assistant manager @entity34 took charge of the team with @entity6 in the stands for @entity13 's trip to @entity39 , and @entity0 admitted it had been a tough few days for the players			1
he said : ' it is a difficult situation , but @entity34 is with us			0
he has the experience to take the job			2
' of course it is difficult , but it has not affected the team			0
when you go on the field , you have to leave all the problems behind you			0
' the @entity1 captain ruled out the chance of moving into management ' for now ' after the @entity30 draw @entity0 also backed current caretaker manager @entity34 , who is more experienced in management @entity34 's audition - he has ambitions to return to management in his own right - looked to be going swimmingly after a good start			1
@entity1 dominated the first half as @entity30 lost three men - skipper @entity62 , @entity64 and substitute @entity65 - to a combination of injury and illness , and led 2 - 1 at the break courtesy of strikes from @entity71 and @entity72 either side of @entity75 's own goal			1
however , comeback kings @entity30 , who fought back from 2 - 0 down at @entity78 on sunday to claim a point , responded spectacularly after the break and got their reward when @entity21 headed them level			1
but having also hit the woodwork on four occasions , they looked to be heading for defeat when @entity86 restored the @entity88 ' lead 12 minutes from time , only for @entity89 to dash the home side 's hopes with four minutes remaining			2
@entity34 ( right ) and @entity92 ( left ) are in temporary charge of @entity1 after @entity6 's departure @entity86 puts @entity1 ahead for the third time but they could not hang on for a win for @entity30 boss @entity98 , it was another remarkable afternoon just five days after his side came back from 2 - 0 down to draw 2 - 2 at @entity78			1
@entity98 said : ' there is a mentality here that is very , very strong , and it 's been there all season			2
people have said to me , ' you must be pleased with the belief now ' - i was pleased with it at the beginning of the season			0
' the performances over this @entity116 period have been absolutely outstanding			0
how we did n't get anything against @entity119 is a head - scratcher in itself ; we were excellent at @entity78 and i thought we were excellent today			0
' we have just played five out of the top 10 and taken five points over that @entity116 period with a lot of games - very good signs about what we think we can do this season			0
' despite losing three players to injury in the first half , @entity98 refused to make any excuses @entity98 sent out the same starting xi for the sixth successive game , but the premature exits of @entity62 , @entity135 and @entity65 - he fears the latter may have suffered a serious ankle injury - tore his plans apart , although the manager was not about the feel sorry for himself			1
he said : ' i do n't do excuses , i have n't got time for excuses at any level of football , and certainly not at this level of football			0
' @entity89 celebrates @entity30 's third equaliser during a match that swung back and forth @entity34 was left to reflect upon what might have been after a classic game of two halves			1
he said : ' i am actually sitting here so disappointed because we were so good in the first half and so poor in the second half that we actually have got away with a point			0
we did n't deserve that			0
' i said to @entity98 at the end of the game , ' we did n't deserve that ' , and i think he must have thought i was saying we should have won the game , but no , by no means			0
@entity30 should have won the game			2
