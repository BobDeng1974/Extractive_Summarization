a mother whose two sons were mutilated by @entity3 bombers @entity4 and @entity5 has said it is ' way too soon ' for @entity7 to be turning the atrocity that maimed her family into a movie			1
@entity12 's adult sons , @entity13 and @entity14 , each lost their right leg when they were hit by the explosive mix of shrapnel and ball - bearings unleashing by the @entity20 ' primitive explosives in april 2013			1
the men , now in their mid-thirties , were received horrific wounds as they shielded friends from the second of two blasts which went off by the finish line at the @entity28 almost two years ago			0
they each lost their right leg when @entity5 and @entity37 detonated bombs by the finish line of the 2013 @entity28 in response to the news that @entity3 - born celebrity @entity7 is teaming up with @entity42 to make a feature film from the most harrowing day of her life , @entity12 pointed out that for many the pain is still visceral and real			1
she said : ' i do n't think that could ever be re-created			0
i 've sat in the courtroom with survivors and family members and seen what everybody is going through			0
' it 's been two years ... but people who live it day in and day out , their lives are just coming back somewhat			0
' for people dealing with putting legs on every day or people who lost loved ones , that does n't go away			0
' @entity13 and @entity14 , who both use prosthetic legs , now help run a charity alongside their mother dedicated to helping fellow amputees			1
blast : explosions at the 2013 @entity70 are pictured in the above security footage , released by fedreal prosecutors together : @entity12 is pictured above with her two sons , who now use prosthetic legs and are said to be living a relatively normal life again at a recent fundraiser covered by local station @entity77 , @entity13 said he has now recovered enough to live a relatively normal life			1
he said : ' i 'm starting to work and doing things as usual - i 'm getting married in october			0
' however , the victims of the attack still contend daily with the toll taken on their lives by the fanatical brothers			2
@entity5 , the elder @entity5 , was killed in a firefight not long after the attack			0
@entity4 was captured , and last week was convicted of all 30 charges leveled against him in connection with the bombing			0
guilty : @entity37 , pictured left in an @entity95 handout photo and right in a courtroom sketch , was found guilty on 30 separate charges related to the bombing , 18 of which can carry the death penalty more than half of those charges can be punished by death , and he is due to be sentenced in the coming weeks			2

after the announcements other @entity3 residents weighed in			2
@entity119 , a former @entity120 columnist , said : ' how does someone who markets himself as " a @entity3 guy " not see that it is far too soon , that the city is still far too sad for its trauma to be transformed into mass entertainment ?
