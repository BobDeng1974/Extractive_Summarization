by @entity0 published : 20:07 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 18:24 est , 3 october 2013 more reservists : proposals by secretary of state for defence , @entity5 , campaigners warn today			1
experts said defence secretary @entity5 's proposals could see a massive increase in the number of troops seeking help for severe psychological trauma			1
@entity21 , chief executive of military mental health charity @entity22 , said members of the @entity25 who served on the frontline were at greater risk of developing the condition than ordinary troops			1
mr @entity21 has repeatedly warned that the @entity30 faces a ' ticking timebomb ' of cases involving serving and former military personnel suffering potentially life - changing mental health issues following a decade of relentless conflict			0
but in an interview with @entity37 he expressed grave concerns that the problem could worsen under cost - cutting plans outlined by the @entity41			0
the aim is to reduce the number of regular soldiers from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2018 - an army small enough to fit inside @entity46 - while doubling the number of reservists to 30,000			1
mr @entity21 said reservists returning home from conflicts did not have access to the same level of support afforded to full - time soldiers			1
a recent study by @entity57 , @entity58 , of thousands of servicemen and women in @entity61 and @entity62 found more reservists suffered from @entity17 compared to regular troops			1
reservists were more likely to feel people at home did not understand what they had been through overseas , less likely to feel supported by the military and have more difficulty resuming normal social activities , according to research			1
those who believed they lacked support after leaving their regiments were most vulnerable to @entity17 , anxiety , depression or alcohol and drug abuse			1
mr @entity21 said : ' the preponderance of post-traumatic stress disorder amongst veterans who are reservists is 50 per cent higher than that for the regular servicemen			1
' the reason for that is they do n’t get the level of support from their regiment , their ship or their squadron that they might have done if they were a regular			2
' if we double or treble the number and if we continue with high - intensity warfare then i think society has got a big challenge because we will see a lot more reservists who need help who disappear into their banks or their building societies or their building site who will need to found and helped and that is going to be a challenge			1
' reservists ’ families , friends , colleagues and employers need to be more aware of what they have gone through , mr @entity21 said			2
combat stress say they have seen a 50 per cent increase in the number of veterans returning from @entity62 who seek their help every year since 2009			2
in 2008 - 09 the charity were approached by 56 @entity62 veterans			2
this had risen to 271 in the last year , a fivefold increase			0
@entity123 , 40 , an investment bank analyst , was a @entity125 in the @entity25 in @entity62 from april to october 2007			1
problems : military mental health charity @entity22 , said members of the @entity25 were at greater risk of developing the condition than ordinary troops ( file picture ) he told @entity37 he suffers from what he calls ' @entity135 ' and ' @entity136 ' – leading to nightmares and sleepless nights - after discovering a member of the @entity140 had died in a firefight he had been involved in			1
he said : ' i did n't feel anything at the time			0
i was immersed in the normality of @entity62			0
but it 's when you come home and you 're re-immersed in the different normality of home , the cosiness of home life that you can remember things differently			0
' and i just remember playing my part in killing an extremely terrified , dying man			0
' it 's basically a hangover from the past , which in my experience does not go away			0
and now i 'm not expecting it to either			0
' i 've had years of intensive treatment and i 've no doubt that it has helped me , and the reason i know it has helped me is that i have n't killed myself			0
' an @entity41 spokesman said : ‘ we are committed to giving everyone who serves in our @entity168 all the help and support they need			0
‘ that is why the government has invested £ 7.4million to improve the mental health services available and ensure help is available for everyone who needs it , whether they are a reservist , regular or veteran			2
‘ since 2006 all reservists have had access to the @entity183 and this year we launched plans to give reservists access to occupational health services so they can get routine mental health support when they are in their civilian role			2
‘ we are also working to raise awareness amongst employers of the unique challenges facing reservists			0
