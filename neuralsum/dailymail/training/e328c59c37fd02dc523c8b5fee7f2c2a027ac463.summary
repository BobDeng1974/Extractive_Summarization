by @entity0 - parkinson published : 11:35 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 04:16 est , 15 march 2013 an ex-wife has described the terrifying moment she watched the door handle to her bungalow going down ' very slowly ' before her ex husband burst in and tried to kill her			1
@entity6 was sitting in the kitchen of her home in @entity9 , near @entity10 , when ex-husband @entity11 launched his vicious attack			1
he has now been jailed for 18 years for the attack which happened in september last year , 10 years after they split up			1
she said she was sitting at the kitchen table in her bungalow when @entity11 arrived at her home			1
' i turned to my right where the back door is and i thought i could see the handle going down very slowly , ' she said			1
@entity11 ( left ) tried to kill his ex-wife @entity22 ( right ) in a frenzied knife attack 10 years after they split up ' i kept my eye on the handle and started to get out of the chair , walking towards the door			1
i started panicking a little			2
' i moved over to the door			1
i could see the handle going down further			2
i did realise there was a person through the glass			2
within seconds i realised it was my ex-husband			2
' he burst in and he was swearing at me			2
i did n't know if there was anything in his hand			2
it was very frenzied , very quick			2
i did n't know what was happening			0
i moved around the kitchen table			0
i ended up on the floor			0
' i just thought he was punching me - i did n't know what was going on			0
i felt like i was being pummelled			0
he never let up from the minute he came through the door			1
i knew by all this bleeding i could feel that i could end up getting killed			0
' when the attack finally came to an end , mrs @entity6 went round the house locking all the doors and windows as she waited for the emergency services to arrive			0
@entity58 heard that the couple married in 1985 but split up ' @entity60 ' in 2002 when he sold his business to buy the bungalow and renovate it			1
she said that there had been no previous history of domestic violence and mrs @entity6 described her ex-husband as ' laid - back , jovial and placid ' throughout their marriage			1
mrs @entity6 was sat in the kitchen of her home in @entity9 , @entity10 , when she was attacked by her ex-husband @entity11 denied being the attacker but was convicted after a trial			1
he said on the night of the attack he walked to a friend 's house only to later find his car had been stolen			0
but a set of car keys for his @entity79 were found at the back door of his ex-wife 's house			1
defending him , @entity83 said : ' it is not in his nature to resort to threats or aggressive behaviour			0
there was no build up , no warning , no anything a witness he was with him did n't seem inclined to the opinion that anything was brewing			0
' looking at his behaviour over the last 10 years in which he has been separated , and 18 years before that were married , there is nothing to suggest that he is a dangerous person or a danger to the public			1
' judge @entity104 told @entity105 : ' clearly this was premeditated attack			0
' first you armed yourself with a knife to take as a weapon , you drove for about three miles and you were careful to leave your car about half a mile away and no doubt you would have returned to it if you had not lost your keys in the back garden			1
' your victim was vulnerable the attack came as a total surprise and shock to her because it took place in her home , there was no refuge to seek and nowhere for her to go or to ask for help			1
' your former wife may have taken any opportunity to vilify you after what happened but in fact she did quite the reverse			0
she told police you were not a man of violence and in your marriage to her she remembers you as being laid - back , jovial and placid			2
' if an artery had been severed in this attack her injuries would have likely to have been far worse			0
inevitably she will have some scarring and she will inevitably remember this for a very long time into the future			0
' after the case detective constable @entity141 of @entity142 said : ' this was an unprovoked frenzied attack and has been a horrific ordeal for @entity22			0
' it is testament to the courage and bravery of @entity22 that a dangerous man has been taken off the streets			0

@entity11 jailed for 18 years for attempted murder of his ex-wife
@entity58 heard a financial *disagreement* ' may have *pushed* him over the edge '
denied murdering ex-wife but his keys were in back door of her home
