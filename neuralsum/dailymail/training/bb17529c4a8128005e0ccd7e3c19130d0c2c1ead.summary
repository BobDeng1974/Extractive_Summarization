right , out for a run the 31 - year - old – dubbed @entity22 ever since the @entity23 and @entity23 of @entity25 ’s wedding in 2011 – has been given a monthly column in @entity27 in which to share her diet and exercise tips			1
she already writes for the supermarket ’s food publication @entity33 and now plans to share her ‘ personal philosophy of healthy eating and exercise ’			0
she swears by four key exercises – ladders , plié squats , wall pushes and the ‘ classic plank ’ – that are ‘ quick and great for toning all over ’			1
