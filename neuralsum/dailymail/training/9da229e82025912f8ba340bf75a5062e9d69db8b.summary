but unlike the show 's ratings , the romances it has produced over the years have not had much luck			2
these days , the programme is almost as famous for the @entity1 curse as it is for the spellbinding fox trots and tangos that it produces			2
they join a long line of @entity1 failed romances , including @entity22 and @entity23 and @entity24 and @entity25 this week the curse has struck again , with @entity27 announcing that she has split from the @entity28 - her dance partner on the show in 2010			1

the stories were n't helped when @entity37 split with her long - term partner @entity48 soon after the show , with @entity38 also splitting with his girlfriend @entity50			2
@entity37 and her dance partner @entity38 in 2004 @entity24 and @entity25 @entity24 and @entity25 were partnered in the 2007 and were plagued with rumours of a romance , despite @entity25 being in a relationship with fellow dancer @entity55			0
but the couple eventually succumbed to their emotions and started dating after @entity25 dumped @entity55			1
@entity24 later said : ' it was front page news			0
the funny thing was the story did not start off as true , but the more you read it , the more you started to believe it and actually act on it			0
' i started to think that if i am getting all this stick , we might as well go out with each other			0
' the chemistry was n't strong enough to last though and the pair later split			2

@entity25 said of @entity74 : ' i 'm probably the happiest i 've ever been			0
' we can chat forever to each other and never run out of things to say			0

the couple started dating while still on the show and after it finished they went on to perform in a @entity100 show called @entity101 together			1
sadly , the romance fizzled out away from the dance floor and they split a year later			2
@entity89 and @entity90 dated for a year after meeting on the show in 2009 @entity22 and @entity23 : 2009 was also the year that @entity22 signed up for the dance competition , where he was partnered with @entity23			1
@entity22 dumped his girlfriend @entity107 and started dating @entity23 , with the couple moving in together after just a year			1
the relationship did n't last though and the couple split last year , with @entity23 blaming her busy work schedule			1
@entity22 and @entity23 had a good run of it , but the couple eventually split after four years together in 2013 @entity115 and @entity116 : 2009 was a bumper year for celebrity - dancer relationships on @entity1 , as @entity115 also rumoured to have had a romance with his partner @entity116			1
the chemistry was enough for @entity115 to take the plunge and dump his two - year girlfriend and fellow @entity124 actor @entity123			0
any chemistry between @entity116 and @entity115 was short - lived though , with @entity115 most recently dating @entity126 and @entity128 's daughter @entity127			0
