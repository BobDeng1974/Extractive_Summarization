@entity94 , my wife , was about to go to work , and she was at the door when the doorbell rang at 7.30			2
the door opened , and i looked over the stairs and i realised immediately what it was			2
' you could see by the grim face that this was n't good news			2
a normal day in the life of a family - and then it got shattered			2
' he now emphasises to casualty notification officers the importance of their role and how vital it is to support grieving families			2
' when a soldier is injured or , tragically , has died , their families need this rock around which they can cling in order to allow them either to grieve - and grieve properly - and to understand , ' he said			1

but you have waves of black grief , when i think it 's extremely difficult to be positive			0

and i am very lucky to have a wife who supports me as i support her			0
i do n't think there is a waking hour where i do n't think and feel sad , but i know that 's what everyone who goes through a loss does			0
