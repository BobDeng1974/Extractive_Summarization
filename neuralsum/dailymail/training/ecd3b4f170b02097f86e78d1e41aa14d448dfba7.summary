‘ i am absolutely amazed that they are not			0
i think people would be surprised if they knew that people who live in this country do not know the words of the anthem			0
‘ it is extraordinary that the government bangs on about citizenship and then be completely ambivalent about whether or not people know the national anthem			0
' @entity8 mp @entity7 said if children were to learn about @entity39 citizenship and history they should also be taught the words to the national anthem			1
his grandfather was @entity65 two prime minister @entity9 mr @entity7 added : ‘ i think it should be compulsory			2
maybe at the end of term and on special occasions			0

’ now mr @entity7 plans to raise the matter personally with mr @entity2 , ‘ because i do n’t think it is good enough ’			1
he added : ‘ i can see some bolshie left wing headteacher refusing to teach the national anthem to their children			1
‘ i just think we do now live in a very diverse nation and our unwritten constitution and everything that goes with it – the church , the crown , the law – if we are going to teach that which we must if people are going to love the country , they should know the national anthem			0
’ a source close to mr @entity2 said : ' @entity2 thinks this is a fantastic idea and supports what @entity7 is saying ultimately this is up to local schools to decide			1

starting back in @entity148 , where i was born , we sang the national anthem at the beginning of each school day			1
‘ it gave me a sense of national pride , which has served me well			0
‘ seeing young children waving their union jacks with pride during the @entity156 , it occurred to me that perhaps we should start each school day with the singing of our national anthem so that they have a sense of national pride embedded in their psyche - because the feeling of being proud of who you are is the best confidence booster , which in turn helps with learning			1
’ in june mr @entity31 asked @entity32 's players to sing the @entity96 in unison in one of his first initiatives as manager			0
former players said it was the first time they could remember the whole team singing together at the start of a match			0
