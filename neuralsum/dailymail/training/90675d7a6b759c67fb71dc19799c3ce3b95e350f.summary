from crocheted boyfriends to woolly teapots , it would seem there 's little that ca n't be created with a pair of knitting needles and a few balls of wool			2
but one @entity10 artist has decided to take things a step further and has covered an entire train with colourful crochet			1
and by covering the full - scale @entity19 steam locomotive engine and carriages in crochet , artist @entity16 - real - name @entity17 - says she has pulled off her largest ' yarn bombing ' to date			1
hard work : it took @entity10 artist @entity16 two days working round the clock to completely cover this train in yarn impressed : the crochet - covered train has proved a hit with @entity32 locals and will be on display until the 19th @entity16 , whose previous projects include full body ' wearable sculptures ' and a crocheted grapefruit , worked around the clock for two days in @entity32 , @entity39 to cover the train in yarn , working with four assistants and braving cold , rainy weather to complete it			1
' yarn bombing ' - also known as guerrilla knitting and yarn storming - is a type of street art that involves covering anything from trees to benches in brightly coloured knits			2
although yarn bombing has been around since 2004 , this is the first time that anything as big as a train has been attempted			0
according to @entity16 , the work , which will be on display until the 19th august , pays tribute to famous @entity10 poet @entity59 , whose poem entitled @entity61 is cherished in @entity39 and is being celebrated throughout the year			1
@entity62 : the train prior to being on the receiving end of a yarn bombing by @entity16 and her friends creative : @entity16 ( above ) has pulled off several yarn bombings and has even created wearable sculptures challenge : @entity16 and her team struggled to finish the piece , now entitled @entity74 intricate : completing the gargantuan yarn bombing operation involved two days of continuous knitting @entity16 has named the work @entity74 to reflect how gruelling it was to complete			1
she explains : ' we all know this particular poem about the locomotive by @entity59			0
it is probably one of the first things i had to memorise			0
' it is nice to come back to @entity39 to be able to create such a powerful piece			0
i was in @entity87 at the @entity88 in the presence of prince @entity90 in july			0
' then early the next day i took a morning flight to @entity39 ( wearing my costume and mask from last night ) to work on the locomotive			1
' i had the best crew ever			0
they worked as hard as i always do			0
i called this train ' @entity74 ' as i love it , but it almost killed me			2
' completed : the vast locomotive and its carriages were thoroughly yarn bombed - despite the rainy weather vast : the scale of @entity74 is made clear when seen at a distance			1
the yarn will remain until the 19th			0
