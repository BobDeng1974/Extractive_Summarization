a year ago , @entity1 workers walked for miles scanning aisles in huge warehouses to pick up items ordered by online customers			2

they navigate by scanning coded stickers on the floor , following digital commands that are beamed wirelessly from a central computer			1
each of the orange machines can slide under and then lift a stack of shelves that 's four feet ( 1.2 metres ) wide and holds up to 750 lbs ( 340kg ) of merchandise			1
