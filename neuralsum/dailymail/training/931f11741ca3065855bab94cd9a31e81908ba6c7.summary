@entity1 ’s @entity0 has become the first @entity3 chairman to call for a system to be introduced to protect the game ’s young millionaire players from frittering away their wages			1
football ’s ‘ too much , too soon ’ culture — whereby young stars like @entity12 ’s @entity11 can earn £ 50,000 a week after a handful of games — is causing major concern in football ’s higher echelons , because it could demotivate young players , and because they may spend the money unwisely and have nothing left when they need it			1
@entity25 boss @entity24 , under pressure to increase 19 - year - old @entity23 ’s contract from £ 40,000 a week , has spoken widely about the issue , stating : ‘ @entity27 players get carried away and then wonder why their careers fall away			1
they buy a new @entity29 before they have a driving licence			0
’ @entity1 chairman @entity0 has expressed concern about the effect of multi-million pound contracts on young players in the @entity3 @entity12 defender @entity11 is set to be rewarded with a £ 50,000 - a - week contract after starting regularly for the club during the early stages of the season former @entity40 manager @entity39 , who helped develop the career of dozens of players including @entity43 and @entity44 , has revealed that the subject kept coming up when he was part of @entity49 ’s @entity48 commission into the game			1
peace is particularly concerned about wages being squandered			2
he said : ‘ my view on young players is that it would be a good thing to try to protect their money in some way			1
when you read about @entity11 and other young players getting a big jump in wages , the natural reaction is “ wow ”			1
' you just hope , when any young player is being given all this money , that the agents or friends are advising them to put it away somewhere safe , so if it goes wrong or they have an injury , they have something saved to enjoy when they eventually retire			2
‘ i just think there should be some mechanism in place so all the money they earn is not spent			2
’ @entity48 chairman @entity49 revealed the subject of astronomical wages for young players came up during his recent commission into the state of the game @entity1 gave @entity82 under 21 star @entity83 the chance to impress at a young age peace is at a club that prides itself on developing young players			1
@entity1 gave @entity88 a debut at 16 — he has since signed for @entity90 — and currently have @entity82 under 21 striker @entity83 on their books			0
@entity83 has already scored six goals this season			0
the @entity1 chairman added : ‘ i am sure some agents are already very good at looking after their players long term , but i worry about what happens to others			0
‘ i remember one player here who came with nothing and went out with nothing			0
he had earned quite a lot of money in the years he was with us and really had nothing to show for it			0
' a tragedy really , and the figures for @entity3 salaries are getting bigger and bigger			2
for the man in the street , it is a hell of a lot of money			0
’ @entity11 , 20 , has been offered a deal by @entity12 that will take his salary from £ 2,000 to around £ 50,000 a week , a pay rise of 2,400 per cent			1
he has played six @entity3 matches			2
@entity11 is currently on £ 2,000 - a - week at @entity122 but that is about to increase to £ 50,000 although @entity0 did not go into details about what his ‘ mechanism ’ should entail , clubs in @entity125 have experimented with the idea of a trust fund for younger players so they can only access part of their salary when they are older			1
@entity39 said although the trust fund was not among the recommendations of @entity49 ’s commission , the issue of growing salaries for young players was one he has heard discussed regularly			2
‘ it ’s a difficult one for me to give an opinion on because we never had that issue at @entity40 , ’ @entity39 said			0
‘ if we offered a promising young player £ 500 - a - week with a £ 5,000 signing - on fee , their faces would light up			1
’ agent @entity147 , who was recently involved in the £ 13million transfer of @entity149 to @entity150 , said : ‘ all you can do as a friend is encourage them in general			0
you might suggest that buying a house rather than renting makes more sense , and things like that			0
‘ there have undoubtedly been players even at the top level who have earned big money and are now bankrupt or having to scratch around for a living			0
