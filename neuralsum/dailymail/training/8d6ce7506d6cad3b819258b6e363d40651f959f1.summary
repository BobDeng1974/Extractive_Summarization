by @entity0 , in @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 published : 02:29 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 20:41 est , 28 february 2013 @entity4 is attending the the @entity5 in @entity1 , @entity6 , where he warned against banking reforms which could damage @entity9 's competitiveness @entity4 and @entity10 joined forces yesterday to condemn ‘ deluded ’ plans for a @entity14 - wide cap on bankers ’ bonuses			1
in a rare show of unity , the prime minister and @entity19 mayor each voiced grave concerns about proposals which critics claim could damage the @entity25 and force major banks to move abroad			2
@entity27 said mr @entity4 had ‘ real concerns ’ about the plans			2
@entity30 business secretary @entity30 also criticised the proposals , warning they would ‘ present problems for the @entity9 ’			0
under the @entity37 proposal a perk of two years ' salary could only be paid if a majority of shareholders agreed to it			1
the deal must be signed off by @entity37 governments before coming into force next year but chancellor @entity44 is expected to argue against it at a meeting of @entity14 finance ministers next year			1
mr @entity4 , meeting @entity14 leaders in the @entity50 capital @entity1 , also cautioned that the cap should not be allowed to stifle @entity9 's role as a global banking centre			1
speaking during a press conference , the @entity17 said : ' we have major international banks based in the @entity9 that have branches and activities all over the world			0
' we need to make sure that regulation put in place in @entity62 is flexible enough to allow those banks to continue competing and succeeding while being located in the @entity9			0
' we will look carefully at the outcome of the negotiations before working out the appropriate take at @entity67 next week			0
the @entity5 brings together prime ministers from @entity70 and @entity71 countries and @entity9 in @entity1 , @entity50			0
pictured from left : @entity74 's premier @entity73 , ambassador @entity75 and @entity76 , @entity78 's premier @entity77 , @entity80 's premier @entity79 , @entity82 's premier @entity81 , @entity50 's prime minister @entity83 , @entity9 prime minister @entity4 , @entity85 's premier @entity84 ' @entity9 wants effective bank regulations			1
one of the failures of the last government was the failure of not having effective bank regulations			2
we will look carefully at the outcome of the negotiations			0
' he said the @entity9 should instead focus on the @entity94 plan , which would separate risk - taking investment banks from retail or high street banks ' we must be able to implement the @entity94 plan in the @entity9 which in some ways is tougher than regulations that are being put in place in other @entity14 countries			2
' @entity10 joined the chorus of @entity9 opposition , branding the plans ' deluded ' and ' self - defeating '			1
the @entity19 mayor warned it would simply play into the hands of the @entity109 's overseas rivals , while undermining support for the @entity37 in @entity9			1
' people will wonder why we stay in the @entity37 if it persists in such transparently self - defeating policies , ' he said			1
' @entity62 can not control the global market for banking talent			0
@entity62 can not set pay for bankers around the world			0
' the most this measure can hope to achieve is a boost for @entity121 and @entity122 and @entity123 at the expense of a struggling @entity37			1
this is possibly the most deluded measure to come from @entity14 since @entity126 tried to fix the price of groceries across the @entity129			0
' battle : chancellor @entity44 opposes a cap like the one agreed by @entity37 chiefs last night mr @entity44 is expected to try to block the plans , claiming it would prevent @entity25 firms hiring the best staff , prompting an exodus of top talent to @entity123			1
the deal must still be signed - off by @entity37 governments before coming into force in 2014 but the @entity9 is struggling to convince other countries it is a bad idea			1
if @entity9 loses its showdown with @entity62 , it would mean the most draconian clampdown on fat cats ' perks since the financial crisis of 2008			0
it came as the taxpayer - owned @entity151 announced losses of £ 5.16bn for last year , but it is still expected to pay its top five executives £ 6m in shares and an annual bonus on top of their six or seven figure ‘ basic ’ salaries			1
@entity151 said it paid employees £ 607 million in bonuses for 2012 , including £ 215 million for investment bankers , down from a total pot of £ 789 million in 2011			1
the bank 's chief executive , @entity163 , insisted that ' pay should be aligned with contribution ' , but denounced the plan to impose bonus rules which will apply only to the banking industry			1
' i do n't think bankers should be treated as special creatures in any way , ' he said			0
' i think we should apply rules in the same way to anyone			0
' under the proposed @entity37 rules , payments to bankers would only be allowed to reach twice the annual fixed salary if a large majority of a bank 's shareholders signed it off , said @entity185 , the @entity186 's chief negotiator today			1
' this overhaul of @entity37 banking rules will make sure that banks in the future have enough capital , both in terms of quality and quantity , to withstand shocks			1
this will ensure that taxpayers across @entity14 are protected into the future , ' said @entity199 's finance minister @entity198 , who led the negotiations for 27 governments			0
the bonus cap was part of a sweeping financial reform package introducing higher capital requirements for banks , the so - called @entity208 rules			0
last night 's agreement - reached at during an eight - hour make - or - break negotiating session between @entity37 politicians , the @entity212 and representatives of the bloc 's 27 governments in @entity62 - ensures the package can take effect next year			1
top bankers and traders may currently earn bonuses multiple times their base salary based on their performance , given that there is no legal pay limit yet			2
but public outrage has grown across @entity14 over large bonus payments to executives of banks that received huge state bailouts during the financial crisis			0
taking the lad : @entity199 finance minister @entity198 helped broker the deal and says it will ensure taxpayers across @entity14 are protected proponents of the bonus cap say the payments encouraged bankers to take massive risks at the expense of the long - term future of their businesses , which helped to destabilise the financial system			2
' for the first time in the history of @entity37 financial market regulation , we will cap bankers ' bonuses , ' mr @entity185 said			1
' the essence is that from 2014 , @entity14 banks will have to set aside more money to be more stable and concentrate on their core business , namely financing the real economy , that of small and medium - sized enterprises and jobs			2
' @entity9 , home to @entity14 's biggest financial industry , had vehemently rejected the proposal , saying the rules would drive away talent and hamper growth			0
@entity19 tried to rally other @entity37 governments behind its position , but failed to garner enough support			2
most governments said they would accept the bonus cap to ensure the more important @entity208 rules come into force by january 2014			2
the @entity270 ( @entity271 ) immediately claimed that the agreement to curb bankers ’ pay exceeded @entity37 powers			2
@entity271 secretary - general @entity276 , a former adviser to the @entity212 , said : ' what @entity37 negotiators have failed to appreciate is that such an action is beyond the powers vested in the @entity37 under the @entity281			1
@entity282 ( 5 ) of the treaty clearly states that @entity37 legislative powers shall ‘ not apply to pay ’			2
' furthermore , even if the council ’s powers were not challenged in this matter , financial institutions would remain free to increase base salaries to reward and retain key staff			0
he went on : ' what politicians and bureaucrats have always ignored is that high remuneration levels in the financial sector - and especially substantial variable payments - serve to minimise fraud levels , retain talent , drive high performance and encourage continuity of employment			0
that is why corruption is so rife in many states where senior banking staff are badly paid			0
' many @entity37 states have long coveted the @entity109 ’s success as an international financial centre and regarded high bonus payments as its @entity311			2
this measure is therefore no more than an attempt to exploit the current vulnerability of the @entity25 by riding on the back of the collective jealousy of bankers ’ pay in public opinion and the recent downgrading of the @entity9 ’s international credit rating			0
' disaster : the @entity9 fears that the top talent working in the @entity25 will leave @entity19 for rivals like @entity123 where bonuses would be higher but mr @entity185 said it was a bigger deal than just bank bonuses , including key measures long demanded to make loans to @entity330 easier : “ the new banking law is not only a piece of banking regulation , but a real economy financing act			1
' the negotiations on the package have been dragging on for 10 months			0
after a meeting last week broke down without a compromise , the @entity186 - which has insisted on adding the banker bonus legislation to the wider @entity208 package - gave the @entity37 governments an ultimatum until yesterday 's negotiating session			1
now the final approval by parliament and government leaders of the package is expected to be a formality , although it was not immediately clear what position @entity9 would take			0
but even if the @entity9 would not back the package , the remaining @entity37 members could still force the legislation through by adopting it by qualified majority			1
the key part of the package is requiring all banks to gradually increase their capital over the coming years to stabilise the financial sector across the @entity37 's member states , which together form the world 's largest economy			1
the legislation is part of global efforts to prevent another shock to the financial system like that prompted by @entity366 ' 2008 collapse , when banks were highly leveraged while enjoying low capital requirements			0
the lack of solid financial cushions meant that many banks were vulnerable , and eventually required taxpayer - funded bailouts to avoid bankruptcy .			0

a payment worth twice an annual salary must be agreed by bank 's board
deal must be agreed by @entity37 leaders before coming into force in 2014
@entity151 revealed today it lost £ 5.16bn in 2012 but still paid £ 607m in bonuses
