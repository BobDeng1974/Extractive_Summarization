midfielder @entity65 said : ' we had an idea they might rest a few players and that gave us more confidence			2
' @entity77 informed his squad of the starting line - up after friday morning 's training session and they arrived in @entity6 at 5.30pm			1
they sat down for dinner in the plush hotel restaurant at 6.30pm , when players were given a choice of steak , pasta or chicken , and whisper it , a small bowl of apple crumble and custard			0
with no curfew , players retreated to their rooms to watch @entity106 v @entity105			1
some , though , found themselves switching over midway through the clash at @entity109 to @entity110 for some lighter viewing			0
those who stuck with the football were impressed by @entity106 's gutsy display in securing a goalless draw			1
' they were hungry and i took great inspiration watching them , ' revealed @entity65			2
@entity1 's soon - to - be heroes were back in the hotel restaurant between 8am - 10am for breakfast before congregating in the lobby at 11.30pm for a 10 - minute pre-match walk around @entity6			1
some did impressions of @entity19 to ease their nerves , while goalkeeping coach @entity127 — very much the joker in the @entity1 pack — did his utmost to keep the players relaxed			2
@entity1 had lunch at the hotel at 11.45am before setting off for @entity28 at 1.15pm			1
as they got caught in some light @entity137 traffic they were confronted with a heart - warming ice - breaker as thousands of @entity1 fans , enjoying a few pre match beverages , swarmed the coach to provide the loudest of good luck messages			2
arriving at @entity28 at 1.30pm , some stayed in dressing room until the warm - up , while others immediately took a stroll on to the pitch to soak in the growing atmosphere			2
less than 24 hours before the victory , @entity1 watched @entity153 on @entity110 's @entity154 the @entity14 side stayed in @entity6 's @entity5 ahead of the @entity4 clash against @entity15 some of the @entity1 squad watched @entity106 's draw with @entity105 and took inspiration from the result @entity77 re-iterated his side 's gameplan in the team talk 10 minutes before kick - off - to break down the flanks , not to run through the middle of @entity15 , to hit diagonal balls into tall forward @entity55 allowing attacking midfielder @entity167 to pick up second balls , not to press all over the pitch but only in their own half and to minimize any risk taking			1
then it was time for @entity77 to inspire ; ordering his charges to believe in themselves , convincing them they were fitter than @entity15			1
' we were all in their wishing each other luck , it was really genuine , ' said @entity65			0
' at some clubs you 'll see players just tap someone and say ' good luck ' and not really mean it			0

' @entity65 ( left ) runs away to celebrate after @entity189 sealed @entity1 's historic win former @entity15 midfielder @entity65 celebrates wildly after finding the back of the net against his old club @entity15 's players are left dejected after @entity1 's stunning comeback in west @entity10 on saturday and there was even time for one more wise crack when one player 's over-zealous attempts to gee - up his team - mates with some rather colourful language prompted substitute @entity204 to tell his team - mate to calm down , prompting a huge ripple of laughter			1
as they opened the door into the tunnel , @entity15 were already waiting for them			0
for @entity65 , who played in @entity19 's first ever game as @entity15 manager , this was a poignant moment			1
but his attempts to remain focused were scuppered by his old mentor			0
' as i come out i hear a scream of : " @entity65 " in a @entity219 accent			0
it 's @entity19 , ' said @entity65			2
' i did n't know where to look			0
i said : " @entity222 " which is gaffer in @entity219			0
he shook my hand , gave me a hug and said to me you 're 29 now , you 're a big man			0
' at that time i did n't want to see him because i was so focused			0
' @entity19 ( right ) exchanges some angry words with his opposite number @entity77 @entity48 ( right ) scores for @entity1 to make it 2 - 1 and give the visitors some hope late in the first half @entity15 goalkeeper @entity235 dives to try and stop @entity48 's effort but comes up short after the first 39 minutes , you could forgive @entity65 for fearing that his impromptu reunion with @entity19 would be the highlight of his afternoon as @entity15 raced into a 2 - 0 lead			1
but @entity48 's phenomenal strike before half - time changed the game 's complexion			0
and then came the moment that will remain with @entity65 for the rest of his life			0
here it is in his own words : ' it was an easy tap in but it was crazy			0
i dreamt about it twice in the week			0
' before the game i thought i would n't celebrate scoring against @entity15			0
in my mind i did n't know what to do , but my overriding emotion was that i scored for @entity1 , they deserve my passion			0
