by @entity0 last updated at 9:38 am on 20th january 2012 @entity1 will increase the price of second class stamps by 50 per cent if it gets the go - ahead			1
the state - owned company wants the cost of the stamps to rise from the current 36p to at least 50p			2
@entity8 has been carrying out a consultation aimed at giving greater commercial freedom to @entity1 , including handing the firm the power to set the price of first class stamps			1
sky high : @entity1 have demanded the right to charge people as much as they want to send a letter it is proposing a cap on second class stamps of between 45p and 55p , but @entity1 has confirmed it wants them to be at the upper end of the scale			1
@entity8 said its proposals , announced in october , were aimed at protecting the universal service obligation ( @entity25 ) under which the @entity1 has to deliver to any address in the @entity27 for the same price , six days a week			1
it has been under pressure in recent years because of falling mail volumes , which has seen the number of letters delivered every day slump by 22 million to 62 million between 2006 and 2010 , contributing towards a loss of £ 120million last year			0
consumers have also switched from first to second class mail - now posted in equal numbers - while stamp prices have lagged behind inflation for almost 20 years			0
soaring : the price of a first class stamp has risen from 27p in 2000 to 46p today the price of a first class stamp in the @entity27 is among the lowest in @entity43 at 46p , compared with 69p in @entity44 , 67p in @entity45 and 60p in @entity46 , while service targets are among the highest , @entity8 pointed out			1
the @entity48 said it has ‘ extreme concerns that the small business community will disproportionately suffer under the new reforms			0
’ yesterday @entity1 insisted it must be able to charge as much as it likes for a first or second class stamp			1
in a decision which will trigger outrage among its customers , the state - owned company wrote to @entity27 ’s postal regulator insisting all the current price caps , should be scrapped			1
the letter , seen by the @entity60 , states clearly : ‘ @entity1 does not believe that the case is strong for the imposition of a price cap on any of our products			1
’ the letter states that , if @entity8 insists on a price cap , that it ‘ should be set at the upper end of @entity8 ’s proposed range ( ie 55p			1
) ’ it went on to say that it believes there is ‘ no affordability concern ’ for @entity27 ’s cash - strapped households			0
the campaign group , @entity72 , has already raised its concerns about @entity8 ’ s proposals , which it fears could lead to ‘ steep price rises for customers			2
’ a spokesman said : ‘ in the worst case it could result in a financially troubled @entity1 , which remained in public hands , imposing higher and higher prices on its dwindling customer base and with its modernisation programme mired in industrial relation problems			2
’ other responses to @entity8 ’s consultation , which were published yesterday , raise major concerns about how small businesses will cope with future price hikes			0
@entity90 , chairman of the federation ’s trade unit , warned : ‘ in the worst case scenario , they may be priced out of the market with no suitable postal competitor to switch to			0
’ the @entity97 said ‘ no - limit increases ’ in stamp prices will ‘ harm ’ small business			0
@entity102 , head of campaigns , said : ‘ it would simply create another cost barrier to trading for small firms reliant on postal services who can ill afford further price hikes			0
‘ we understand that @entity1 is currently a loss - making organisation and action needs to be taken to address this			2
‘ but we believe constant price rises are not the way to tackle the issue			0
’ she added : ‘ during the difficult economic climate , we believe it is unjustifiable for @entity1 to increase its prices by large amounts without check			2
’ latest figures show @entity1 ’s @entity27 letters and parcels division lost £ 41million between march and september last year			2
@entity1 insists it would not raise stamp prices dramatically because such a move would drive away customers , which is the corporate equivalent of shooting itself in the foot			1
a spokesman for @entity8 , which is expected to publish its final decision in march , said : ‘ our proposals seek to ensure that @entity27 consumers continue to benefit from the universal one - price - goes - anywhere postal service			0
‘ we will consider all consultation responses and aim to publish a statement in the spring			0

price of second class stamps has almost *doubled* from *19p* in 2000 to 36p today
@entity1 insists it should be able to charge what it wants for postage
decision set to trigger outrage amongst customers
