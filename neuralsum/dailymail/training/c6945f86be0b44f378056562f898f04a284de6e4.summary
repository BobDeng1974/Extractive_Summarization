the golden mask of @entity1 has been permanently damaged after its ' beard ' was stuck on with epoxy the blue and gold braided beard on the burial mask of famed pharaoh @entity1 was hastily glued back on with the wrong adhesive , damaging the relic after it was knocked during cleaning			1
the @entity10 in @entity11 , where the burial mask is kept , is one of the city 's main tourist sites , but in some areas , ancient wooden sarcophagi lay unprotected from the public , while pharaonic burial shrouds mounted on walls crumble behind open glass cases			2
@entity1 's mask , over 3,300 years old , and other contents of his tomb are the museum 's top exhibits			1
three of the museum 's curators reached by telephone gave differing accounts of when the incident occurred last year			2
they also could not agree whether the beard was knocked off by accident while the mask 's case was being cleaned or if was removed because it was loose			1
they did agree , however , that orders came from above to fix it quickly and that an inappropriate adhesive was used			2
all spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of professional reprisals			0
' unfortunately he used a very irreversible material - epoxy has a very high property for attaching and is used on metal or stone but i think it was n't suitable for an outstanding object like @entity1 's golden mask , ' one curator said			1
' the mask should have been taken to the conservation lab but they were in a rush to get it displayed quickly again and used this quick drying , irreversible material , ' they added			2
the curator said that the mask now shows a gap between the face and the beard , whereas before it was directly attached : ' now you can see a layer of transparent yellow			1
' another museum curator , who was present at the time of the repair , said that epoxy had dried on the face of the boy king 's mask and that a colleague used a spatula to remove it , leaving scratches			1
the first curator , who inspects the artifact regularly , confirmed the scratches and said it was clear that they had been made by a tool used to scrape off the epoxy			1

but authorities have made no significant improvements to the @entity10 since its construction in 1902 , and plans to move the @entity1 exhibit to its new home in the @entity104 scheduled to open in 2018 have yet to be divulged			1
the burial mask is kept in the @entity104 in @entity11 ( pictured ) , which is one of the city 's main tourist sites neither the @entity109 nor the museum administration could be reached for comment wednesday evening			2
one of the curators said an investigation was underway and that a meeting had been held on the subject earlier in the day			0
the burial mask , discovered by @entity118 archeologists @entity119 and @entity120 in 1922 , triggered worldwide interest in archaeology and ancient @entity87 when it was unearthed along with @entity1 's nearly intact tomb			1
' from the photos circulating among restorers i can see that the mask has been repaired , but you ca n't tell with what , ' egyptologist @entity129 said			0
' everything of that age needs a bit more attention , so such a repair will be highly scrutinized			0
