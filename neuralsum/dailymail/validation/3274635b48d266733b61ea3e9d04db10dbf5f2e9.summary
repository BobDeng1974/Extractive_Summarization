@entity0 has refused to agree to a $ 5million fine should either he or @entity1 fail a drug test , according to the @entity5 star 's adviser			1
both fighters are subject to random , @entity8 - style testing by @entity9 in the build up to their $ 300m ( Â£ 200m ) mega-fight in @entity12 on may 2			2
should either fail a test , they would likely be banned for four years but @entity1 also wanted a financial penalty			1
@entity1 had his first blood and urine test last saturday ahead of his fight against @entity0 @entity1 and @entity0 must both undergo random testing which is overseen by @entity9 ' today we were informed that @entity0 turned down the request , ' @entity19 told @entity22			1
' @entity1 had requested that there would be a reciprocal fine of $ 5 million for a failed drug test			2
' the details of the testing were not written into the fight contract but were instead included in a separate agreement			0
and @entity0 's adviser @entity30 said that was @entity1 's mistake			1
' @entity19 is an idiot , and @entity1 should be ashamed to have him as his representative , in my opinion , ' he told @entity37			0
' it 's obvious he did n't read the contract			0
why would he have his fighter sign something he was not happy with ? @entity0 and @entity1 failed to agree a $ 5million penalty should either man fail a drug test @entity0 has long demanded his opponents submit to random , @entity8 - style drug testing ' the deal was negotiated up and down by his promoter on behalf of @entity1 with @entity0 and @entity49 , and it 's been well documented in the media for quite some time			1
' if this moron did n't convey his fighter 's wishes when the negotiation was going on , that 's their problem			0
this is a lame - ass attempt to generate publicity			0
' drug testing was the central reason for a collapse in negotiations five years ago when @entity1 refused to agree to the same strict conditions			2
@entity1 was tested for the first time last saturday when he was visited in @entity65 .			0
