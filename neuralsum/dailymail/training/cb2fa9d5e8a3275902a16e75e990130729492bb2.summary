by @entity0 travellers may experience airport delays and holiday disruptions if the @entity5 government decides to tighten security measures ahead of new intelligence signalling a possible airliner attack			1
concerns a new generation of innovation in bomb making is being developed in the battlegrounds of @entity13 and @entity14 could prompt a tightening of security across @entity18 and @entity5 airports			1
it would likely disrupt travel plans and cause airport chaos for those heading away this summer , although the @entity4 has not yet formally declared what it intends to do			1
the intelligence has revealed the groups are developing new covert weapons as well as recruiting willing plot members from the large number of foreigners currently fighting in the region			2
many of these radicalised fighters carry @entity18 and @entity5 passports and have travelled to the region to help @entity35 establish its @entity36 , or join the @entity38 affiliated @entity37			1
to try and stop the attacks , one source told the network the new airport security measures could include increasing rates of random screenings , targeting certain types of travellers and increasing its armed air marshall presence			1
fighting across the region has been brutal in recent weeks with @entity35 carrying out mass executions and crucifixions so blood thirsty it has been branded too extreme by @entity38			0
the @entity76 said more than 2,400 @entity13 had been killed in june alone , making the current violence the most deadly since the height of sectarian warfare in 2007			0
this chilling shot from an @entity35 video purports to show the execution of @entity13 soldiers in the @entity85 province a rally took place in @entity88 last week airing the public 's opposition to the militant @entity35 jihadists @entity92 , @entity13 , is home to an estimated 1,500 displaced locals caught up in the fighting around @entity96 @entity35 yesterday declared it would now call itself the @entity36 â€“ to reflect the territory it controls across @entity14 and @entity13 and its goal of establishing an @entity100 state across the entire @entity101 , @entity102 and parts of @entity18 by the year 2020			1
the announcement , made on the first day of the @entity100 holy month of @entity106 , could trigger a wave of infighting among @entity110 extremist factions that have until now formed a loose rebel alliance			0
@entity112 , leader of @entity35 and the person to announce the creation of the new @entity100 state a spokesman for @entity35 declared the group 's chief , @entity112 , as the leader of the new caliphate , or @entity100 state , and called on @entity122 everywhere , not just those in areas under the organization 's control , to swear loyalty to him			0
the group currently controls a large slice of @entity14 and @entity13 , and conquered large swathes of territory at breakneck pace in recent weeks before slowing down when it found itself at the edge of @entity52			0
as well as plans to expand its caliphate throughout the @entity101 , @entity102 , and large parts of western @entity138 , the map also marks out an expansion in parts of @entity18			2
@entity141 , which was ruled by @entity122 for 700 years until 1492 , is marked out as a territory the caliphate plans to have under its control by 2020			0
elsewhere , @entity35 plans to take control of the the @entity147 states - including @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 - extending its territories in eastern @entity18 as far as @entity152 , which appears to be based on a @entity154 borders of the @entity155 .			2
