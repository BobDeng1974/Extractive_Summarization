the love of her life died fighting in the trenches of the @entity4 and she had lived through the horrors of the @entity7			2
but nothing prepared @entity10 ’s oldest woman for the terror of being targeted in her own home by a violent career criminal			1
@entity14 had just celebrated her 112th birthday when @entity16 burst into her flat			1
he kicked her door down and shoved her against a wall as he rifled her handbag , snatching £ 100 in cash			2
@entity16 ( right ) pretended to be a delivery man to gain access to her home , where he pinched her purse			1
yesterday , after he was jailed for four and a half years , it emerged that @entity16 was on licence at the time for a series of burglaries in which he preyed on the elderly			1
the 46 - year - old has 16 convictions for 48 burglaries dating back to the age of ten			1
yet he was let out in may 2009 after serving half of a seven - year sentence despite the risk of him reoffending			1
@entity40 , who was born on december 7 , 1899 , became the oldest living person in @entity10 in february this year			2
@entity16 , 46 , tricked his way into the home of @entity14 ( right ) in south @entity44 a month after her 112th birthday			1
the spinster had only celebrated her 112th birthday a month before she was attacked in her home in @entity48 , south @entity44			1
the former seamstress , who lost her 19 - year - old fiancé @entity50 during the @entity4 , now lives alone in the area which has become a magnet for crime			1
@entity54 heard that five days before her birthday , an unidentified thief entered her home and stole her £ 300 pension			2
the next day @entity16 attempted to break - in by posing as a parcel delivery man but her neighbour @entity61 , 31 , chased him off after the brave pensioner told @entity16 to ‘ hop it ’			1
then on january 24 , @entity40 answered a knock at the door to find @entity16 posing as a policeman			1
@entity68 , prosecuting , said : ‘ @entity40 went to the door and called out “ who ’s there ? ” ‘ she was expecting the district nurse to visit her that day in order to change a dressing on her leg			2
‘ she heard no reply so she opened the door a crack			2
he pushed the door open , barged past mrs @entity14 and made his way into the flat			2
’ when the trembling victim followed him into the living room , @entity16 pushed her against the wall			1
he grabbed her purse , which contained £ 100 as well as other treasured items including a four leaf clover she kept for luck , before leaving her crumpled on the floor			0
mr @entity61 confronted @entity16 outside having recognised him , but the thug threatened to stab them , snarling : ‘ i ’ve got a tool and i will hurt you			1
’ the neighbour said : ‘ i was just so shocked to see the same guy back again			0
i heard someone ring @entity14 ’s doorbell and opened the door to make sure everything was alright			0
‘ i heard @entity14 say “ what are you doing ” and “ get off me ” so i rushed downstairs			0
i just wanted him to stop and tried to get in his way			0
he said he had a knife and was going to stab me			0
he kept saying he was going to kill me			0
’ @entity16 was only caught when he was spotted by chance by mr @entity61 the next day a mile away			1
he flagged down a police car and the thief was arrested on the spot			0
but the criminal continued to deny responsibility until he suddenly changed his plea on the first day of his trial on tuesday			0
yesterday miss @entity14 said she has been ‘ frightened ever since ’ and now refused to leave her home			2
she said : ‘ i told him to hop it			0
then some days later , he came back and said he was from the police			0
‘ after i opened the door , he pushed me and got my bag			0
i have been frightened ever since			0
’ the spinster , who has outlived her seven siblings , added : ‘ i am so old that all my friends and family are now dead			0
i think i ’m very lucky to have such good neighbours			0
‘ they are my family now , and they know it			0
they are very good to me			0
’ detective constable @entity126 , from @entity128 ’s @entity127 , said : ‘ @entity16 picked on a vulnerable victim who he believed to be an easy target , he did n’t consider the bravery of the victim or the tenacity of her neighbours who were commended by the judge at today ’s sentencing			1
‘ it is thanks to them @entity16 was apprehended so quickly and allowed police to conduct a thorough investigation , giving him no choice but plead guilty			1

@entity16 , 46 , jailed for four years and five months after tricking his way into her south @entity44 home
