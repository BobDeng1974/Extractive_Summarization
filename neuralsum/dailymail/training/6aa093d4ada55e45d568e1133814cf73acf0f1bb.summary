regarding the victim being drunk , mrs @entity139 added : ‘ what has this got to do with this if he forced himself upon her ? ‘ if you get drunk and someone steals your wallet , does this mean it 's any less of a theft than if you were sober ? ‘ he has to work somewhere but it probably should n't be in such a public role since it looks like he 's being given a platform for approval			0
