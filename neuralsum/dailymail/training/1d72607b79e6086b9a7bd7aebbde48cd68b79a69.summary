the same day another @entity1 court listed the @entity126 group @entity125 as a terrorist organisation , judicial sources said , part of a sustained crackdown on @entity59 in the most populous @entity131 state			1
@entity125 is an offshoot of the @entity3 , which the authorities have also declared a terrorist group in @entity1 and have repressed systematically since the coup against @entity58			2
