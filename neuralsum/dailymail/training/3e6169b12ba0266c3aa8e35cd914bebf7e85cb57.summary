by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:34 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 19:41 est , 2 october 2013 racing pundit @entity2 was sacked by @entity3 because bosses did n’t want their own version of ‘ unpopular ’ @entity6 , a tribunal heard yesterday			1
@entity8 , the commissioning editor for sport at @entity3 , said the veteran broadcaster was seen as an irritating ‘ comic act ’ who brought a ‘ farcical tone ’ to shows – and insisted the decision to fire him was nothing to do with his age			2
mr @entity8 told the employment tribunal that several viewer surveys found a large section of the audience disliked the 73 - year - old , with some describing him as ‘ cocky ’ , ‘ a bully , ’ ‘ arrogant ’ and ‘ obnoxious ’			1
fashion presenter @entity26 , pictured left , was considered for a role covering horse racing by @entity3 bosses in the same revamp that saw pundit @entity2 , pictured right , axed , the tribunal heard @entity32 , representing @entity2 , put it to mr @entity8 that ‘ unpopular ’ personalities like @entity6 boosted ratings			1
mr @entity8 admitted that using this tactic could work well , but said it was n’t his chosen route to success , adding : ‘ i do n’t find @entity6 entertaining			1
’ fashion presenter @entity26 was considered for a role covering horse racing by @entity3 bosses in the same revamp that saw pundit @entity2 axed , an employment tribunal heard today			1
the how to look good naked presenter was under consideration to front a fashion segment for the newly revamped @entity3 racing coverage , the hearing into mr @entity2 's ageism claim was told			1
station executives considered the move while they were deciding how to make @entity3 's racing coverage more ' serious ' after it was awarded the exclusive terrestrial rights to broadcast horse racing - including the ' @entity57 ' of @entity58 and the @entity59 , the tribunal heard			1
however , executives from the broadcaster insisted @entity26 would not have been commentating on races and would only have been used to front fashion segments as part of the racing coverage			0
@entity8 , the channel 's commissioning editor for sport , told the hearing : ' @entity26 is in fashion , that is what he would have been doing			1
' asked if @entity26 would been commentating on the betting , he said : ' he would be nowhere near that			0
he was going to do fashion and that was it			0
' earlier in the hearing , mr @entity8 claimed mr @entity79 was ditched after 29 years because his ' pantomime ' style had compromised his credibility , and not because of his age			1
@entity2 - known for his bling , sideburns and deerstalker - has appeared celebrity @entity87 and @entity88 in recent years			1
tribunal fight : @entity2 , seen here arriving at the employment tribunal hearing with his wife @entity92 today , had become a ' comic actor rather than a serious horse racing journalist ' , the hearing was told he is seeking £ 3million compensation from @entity3 and production company @entity96 after he was dismissed earlier this year			1
conservative mp @entity97 today backed @entity2 's fight for compensation and branded his sacking a ' catastrophic mistake '			2
mr @entity8 , @entity3 's commissioning editor for sport , told the @entity103 that @entity2 was no longer regarded as a serious journalist			1
' @entity2 's reputation within the general public , and therefore many potential viewers , had been affected by a number of notorious appearances on a variety of television shows , ' he said			2
' as a result , he was seen by many as a comic actor rather than a serious horse racing journalist			2
' he said @entity2 's persona did not fit in with the programme 's new ' serious ' image			2
' no discrimination ' : @entity3 head of sport @entity8 told the tribunal @entity2 was sacked because his persona did not fit with the new serious image of @entity3 's racing coverage he said : ' @entity2 was considered to have a pantomime style of exaggerated delivery that was incongruous with the more serious , measured style proposed for the programme for 2013			1
' it was felt that @entity2 's presenting style would not help @entity133 appeal to a wider audience , which was critical following the acquisition of extended television rights			0
' he said @entity2 's style was ' out of step with the vision of the programme , and also unappealing to many potential viewers			2
' he also accused the eccentric pundit - known as ' big @entity144 ' to his fans - of hogging the limelight from his fellow presenters because he ' loved the camera '			0
however , mr @entity8 insisted this had nothing to do with the pundit 's age			1
flamboyant : horse racing pundit @entity2 at @entity58 in 2005 when it was held in @entity155			1
he spent 29 years working for @entity3 veteran : the commentator at work at @entity159 in 1995 during 29 years on screen he said : ' none of the decisions taken in respect of who to invite and who not to invite to be in the onscreen team for @entity3 racing from 2013 were taken on the grounds of their age , or , indeed , for any reason other than merit , including the decision not to invite back @entity2			2
' mr @entity8 phoned @entity2 on october 26 last year to tell him he was being ditched from the show allegedly just half an hour before an official press release was sent out announcing the news			1
support : @entity97 mp told the hearing that @entity3 's decision to axe @entity2 was a ' catastrophic mistake ' however , he revealed televison bosses ' only decided definitely not to include @entity2 late on in the planning process '			2
he said that the station wanted to bring in younger viewers , not necessarily younger presenters			0
@entity32 , representing @entity2 , said : ' @entity96 ( @entity96 ) pitch on the basis that they will attract younger viewers through younger presenters			0
' you are scratching around for an explanation for what is plainly the case , which is the majority of people at @entity3 who attended this presentation said it was given on the basis they were going to bring in younger on - screen talent			0
' mr @entity8 said the reference to ' young and upmarket ' was a ' reference to viewers '			2
he said they were worried the press would launch a campaign to reinstate the controversial ' love him or loath him ' pundit			0
he added that horse racing press officer @entity209 , said ' she felt @entity2 would be likely to use the " ageism card " as this was a possibility i had mentioned			1
' another potential consequence @entity216 pointed out is that the @entity217 might support any " campaign " @entity2 might embark upon once he had heard the news			0
' this was because , as @entity216 pointed out , @entity2 is " very much a love or loath person " so it was possible he might garner some support from the press			0
' but while the station admit the flamboyant presenter was a hit with some fans , they branded his presenting style as ' pantomime ' and outmoded			0
and according to some audience surveys , @entity2 was least popular presenter with viewers describing him as ' cocky ' , ' irritating ' and a ' bully ' , the tribunal heard			0
he added : ' @entity2 was also known for using controversial nicknames for his co-presenters and others while on screen			0
' for example , @entity2 referred to @entity242 as " ravishing " , would call @entity243 " the female " , called @entity245 ' and frequently referred to his own wife as " the @entity247 "			0
' @entity2 's nicknames for women contributed to a wider reputation he had for making sexist comments and other bizarre behaviour through his appearances on reality television programmes such as celebrity @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity255			1
' his reality tv stints had meant his ' standing in the public eye had suffered ' , the tv executive said			0
and @entity2 had a ' propensity to irritate and offend viewers ' which meant he was seen as a ' celebrity entertainer and a comedic figure ' , mr @entity8 said			1
meanwhile , mr @entity97 , mp for @entity264 in @entity265 , threw his support behind @entity2 's ageism legal battle			2
the mp , a lifelong horse racing fan who used to work in his mother 's betting shop , has appeared as a guest on @entity3 's @entity275 racing preview programme alongside @entity2 and is now joint chairman of the @entity277 on betting and gambling			1
he said in a statement to the @entity103 : ' i hold @entity2 in the highest regard and believe that he is an expert in his field and an excellent television broadcaster			0
' he is probably the only person , apart from @entity242 , who has reached out to audiences beyond horse racing			0
' i 'm also of the view that it was a catastrophic mistake when he was dismissed from presenting @entity3 racing			0
' mr @entity97 , who is parliamentary spokesman for the @entity288 , told the tribunal that he ' ca n't think of anyone who is more on top of the game , nor more suitable to the role ' than @entity2			0
@entity3 and @entity96 deny age discrimination			0
