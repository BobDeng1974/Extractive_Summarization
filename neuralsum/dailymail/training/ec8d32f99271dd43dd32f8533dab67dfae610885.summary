by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:55 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 10:16 est , 29 january 2014 a man who claims to have captured and killed @entity4 after luring it with pork ribs now says he is planning to take the corpse on an international tour			1
@entity8 , who describes himself as ' best @entity9 in the world ' and claims to have shot the beast near @entity12 in @entity13 in september 2012 , says the world tour will begin on february 6 in @entity15 , @entity16 , with further locations to be revealed over the coming weeks			1
although he also released a second photograph supposedly showing the dead @entity4 , there is a great deal of scepticism over their authenticity , not least because @entity8 was previously involved in a @entity4 hoax in 2008 when a ' corpse ' he put on public display turned out to be a rubber suit			1
he now plans to take the corpse on an international tour body of the beast : @entity8 claims that this is a photo of legendary creature @entity4 , which he shot near @entity12 and now plans to take on tour mr @entity8 claims that he lured the beast by nailing pork ribs he had bought from @entity41 to a tree in @entity12 , @entity13 in september 2012			1
he initially released a grainy close up photograph supposedly showing the creature 's face , but has now released a second photograph of it lying dead on the floor of his tent			0
speaking about inevitable doubts over the authenticity of his supposed kill , 36 - year - old @entity8 told @entity54 that he does n't regret his 2008 hoax , as it put him in contact with people who now fund his full - time @entity4 operations ever since			1
he claims that without the previous publicity stunt , he would never have been able to ' really ' capture a @entity4			0
speaking of killing the animal , he said : ' i nailed ... pork ribs from the @entity41 down the street to the side of the tree , and lo and behold , he came and started eating the pork ribs off the tree			2
' mr @entity8 claims to have filmed the creature as he was enjoying his last meal before going to get his gun and ' with tears in my eyes ' shooting it dead			2
on the @entity74 : @entity8 says he managed to lure the beast in by nailing some pork ribs that he bought at @entity41 to a tree			2
while the creature was eating , mr @entity8 allegedly shot it the excitement surrounding mr @entity8 's claims is tempered somewhat by the fact that he was involved in a @entity4 hoax back in 2008			1
back then , as now , he claimed he had the body of @entity4			0
but the @entity85 reported that , once the frozen body began to thaw , the body turned out to be nothing more than a rubber ape suit			1
this time mr @entity8 is adamant that his @entity4 is ' for real '			0
he said : ' from dna tests to 3d optical scans to body scans			0
it is the real deal			0
it 's @entity4 and @entity4 's here , and i shot it and now i 'm proving it to the world			0
' mr @entity8 has yet to produce the results of the dna tests and optical scans , but he says he will be holding a press conference soon to answer any questions			0
bigfoot sightings have been reported in forested areas all over the world , but physical evidence - such as a partial or complete body of the creature - has so far proven elusive			0
video by @entity8 committed hunter : mr @entity8 is a self - proclaimed ' real ' @entity4 tracker , and he plans to embark on a tour of the @entity113 with his specimen @entity116 face : what appears to be a large humanoid creature scowls at the camera in this grainy still from video footage			1
