rebels captured the strategic @entity101 neighborhood south - east of @entity4 on saturday			2
it was a significant blow to regime forces because the area includes the road the army has used to supply troops			0
troops loyal to @entity112 and rebels have been locked in a deadly stalemate in @entity4 , @entity3 's largest urban center and main commercial hub , since an opposition assault last summer			1
seven months later , the rebels hold large parts of the city and its outskirts , including several army bases			0
but they have been unable to overcome the regime 's far superior firepower			0
airstrike : a building was reduced to a pile of rubble in the attack , which left residents digging through the remnants searching for survivors @entity19 has pledged to continue to support the @entity3 opposition			1
speaking at a security conference in @entity134 , @entity19 foreign minister @entity132 said his country supported efforts to end the bloodshed in @entity3 , but he understood the opposition 's refusal to talk to president @entity112 after so many @entity3 deaths in the fight to topple him			1
' it is easy to say now , ( the ) opposition should accept to sit with the regime , after 60,000 people have been killed , ' @entity132 said at the gathering of top diplomats and security officials in @entity148			0
' assuming that tomorrow there is a new election in ( @entity112 's ) presence , who will guarantee the safety of the opposition leaders ? ' @entity132 said			2
opposition leaders categorically refused any talks with @entity157 until @entity112 steps down			1
in a sharp departure from their resolve , the coalition 's president , @entity158 , said wednesday he is willing to talk to the regime if that would help end bloodshed			0
like the @entity164 and its @entity166 allies , @entity19 has repeatedly called on @entity112 to step down			0
@entity112 brushed the calls aside , outlining a peace proposal last month that would put him in charge of national reconciliation talks			0
@entity171 , @entity112 's most important international ally , said the insistence on his ouster before political talks can begin was counterproductive			0
another staunch supporter of @entity157 , @entity177 , said @entity178 would welcome the opposition leaders to talks			1
' @entity177 has talked to the opposition , ' @entity177 foreign minister @entity181 said in @entity148			0
' we are ready to be part of the solution , ' he insisted			0

' @entity3 television broadcast images of what it said was the aftermath of an @entity193 airstrike on a research facility near @entity157 earlier this week , showing destroyed vehicles and moderate damage to a building			1
@entity193 has not publicly acknowledged wednesday 's airstrike that @entity164 officials said had hit a convoy of anti-aircraft weapons inside @entity3 bound for the militant @entity204 @entity203 group			1
the @entity3 military said the target of the @entity193 jets was a scientific research centre in the area of @entity210 , north - west of @entity157			1
the strike raised tensions between @entity193 and its neighbour @entity3 , which is engulfed by the raging civil war			2
the first purported images of the targeted site , aired by @entity217 on saturday , show the twisted and battered remnants of cars , trucks and military vehicles			0
destruction : today 's airstrike , in the @entity4 neighbourhood of @entity15 , destroyed a building and killed at least 16 people search : people try to recover victims from among the rubble following the devastating blast neighbourhood : the full devastating effects of the bomb can be seen as people stand among the rubble and the dust victim : a man is taken away on a stretcher as residents continue to hunt for survivors a building has broken widows and damaged interiors , but no major structural damage			1
the caption says , ' consequences of the @entity193 aggression on the @entity250 '			0
@entity251 also ran footage of the damage			0
@entity3 's regime vowed revenge for the airstrike while the rebels battling president @entity112 criticised him for not responding to what they termed @entity193 aggression			1
according to a @entity164 official , the strike targeted trucks containing @entity264 anti-aircraft missiles			0
the trucks were next to the research centre the @entity3 identified and the strikes hit both the trucks and the facility			2
advanced anti-aircraft missiles like the @entity264 in the hands of @entity203 could change the strategic equation , which so far has allowed @entity193 to send warplanes over @entity204 practically unopposed			0
desperate : in an amateur video released during the aftermath of the bombing , one man can be heard saying : ' the family of the man over there is still under the rubble ' the @entity3 military denied that the target of the attack was a weapons convoy			2
it said low - flying @entity193 jets crossed into the country over the @entity193 - occupied @entity288 to target the @entity210 centre			2
until wednesday , @entity193 has been reluctant to do anything that would seem an intervention into @entity3 civil war			2
the airstrike adds another layer to the complexity of the @entity3 conflict that has left the international community at a loss for ways to end bloodshed			2
the uprising against president @entity112 began in march 2011 with largely peaceful pro-reform protests and developed into a civil war which the @entity305 says has killed more than 60,000 people			0
the @entity3 government maintains that there is no uprising in @entity3 but a conspiracy against the country because of its support for anti-israeli groups			2
aftermath : people move the remnants of the building as they try to recover victims			0
