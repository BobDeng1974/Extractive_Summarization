by @entity1 reporter published : 15:08 est , 16 august 2012 updated : 15:08 est , 16 august 2012 in the days before the @entity4 podium it was the title belt given to the @entity5 of the late 19th century			1
the @entity6 awarded in 1886 was actually silver rather than the now traditional gold - but it was given to the fastest man in the world over 120 yards			1
the grand belt , complete with a @entity13 flag and detailed inscriptions , was handed to the winner of the 120 yard sprint at the event which took place a decade before the first modern day olympiad in 1896			1
the belt of champions : the @entity6 of @entity22 was awarded to the winner of the 1886 120 - yard sprint the 120 yard sprint was a version of the modern day 100m race in the days before the @entity4 were held			1
the historic belt is now set to fetched tens of thousands of pounds when it goes under the hammer next month			0
the @entity6 of @entity22 , made from silver , was won by @entity32 on november 13 1886 and now belongs to @entity33 , 71 , after being passed down through generations of the family			2
the belt was awarded to crown the world 's fastest men a decade before the first modern day olympiad @entity33 , from @entity40 , @entity41 , said : ' a family member emigrated to @entity43 many , many years ago and the belt was won by one of my relatives in 1886			1
' it belt was eventually bought back to the @entity49 by one of my uncles and it has always been in our family ever since			0
' a little bit of history has been lost along the way and there seems to be no real way to find out more about it only that it was won before the @entity4 as we know them began			1
' the actual race was the equivalent of the 100m today - but i doubt they were quite as fast as @entity5			2
' it was left to me by my father and i have had it for around 15 years now , so it ’s about time for a collector who can really find out more about it to look after it			0
' i took it to a television auction show when it came to town a few years ago who said it was worth £ 10,000 but to a collector it could be £ 100,000 - there is a lot of history here			2
' i ’m sure some @entity43 would love to get their hands on some extra silverware after finishing so far behind us at the @entity4			2
' the @entity6 of @entity22 is being sold as part of a three day fine art and antique sale from 19 - 21 september at @entity90 in @entity91			0
@entity93 @entity92 said : ' it ’s difficult to understand why so little has been recorded about such a big event like this			0
' we ’ve been unable to uncover much information at all which is unusual for something that has such fantastic collectors value attached to it			0
valuable : experts say the 120 - year - old belt could be worth tens of thousands of pounds when it goes under the hammer next month ' the race was basically what is now known as the 100m race at the modern @entity4			1
' these athletic meetings preceded what we now call the @entity4 , this event taking place 10 years before the first games but there could have been many more before			1
' we expect the belt to be snapped up for somewhere between at least £ 6,000 to £ 10,000 but it could be much more			0
' it ’s something very rare which will hardly ever come up at auction again so would mean a great deal to many collectors around the world			0

title was given to sprint champions instead of *medals* in days before @entity4
@entity127 was awarded in 1886 - ten years before first modern olympiad
