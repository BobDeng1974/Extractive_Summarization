@entity1 director @entity0 has caused huge offense to a key @entity4 ally by using language that suggested that @entity6 was an accomplice in the @entity8			1
@entity6 are waiting to see if @entity0 would issue an apology â€” something that had n't happened by late monday			1
@entity6 foreign minister @entity11 said he expected him to say sorry so the matter can be settled			0
@entity0 said last week , ' in their minds , the murderers and accomplices of @entity15 , and @entity6 , and @entity16 , and so many , many other places did n't do something evil			1
' they convinced themselves it was the right thing to do , the thing they had to do			0
that 's what people do			0
and that should truly frighten us			0
' @entity1 director @entity0 , pictured at a news conference last month , has caused huge offense to a @entity4 ally by using language to suggest that @entity6 were accomplices in the @entity8 @entity0 's comments are particularly offensive to @entity6 not only because they had no role in running @entity36 and other death camps where @entity38 were murdered during @entity39 , but because they were themselves victims of the @entity15			1
in all , 6 million @entity6 citizens were killed during the war , about half of them @entity38 and the other half @entity44 , with many @entity6 priests , members of the intelligentsia and political resistance killed in @entity36 and elsewhere			2
@entity6 also had a committed @entity49 resistance movement and @entity6 fighters fought alongside the @entity51 throughout the war			2
@entity6 see themselves as heroes of the war who have never been properly recognized , making comments like @entity0 's hurt even more			1
@entity0 originally delivered the remarks on wednesday at the @entity59 in arguing for the importance of @entity8 education			2
the speech was adapted for an article published in the @entity64 on thursday			0
@entity4 ambassador @entity65 attends ceremonies marking the 72nd anniversary of the @entity68 , in front of the monument to the @entity71 , in @entity72 , @entity6 , on sunday , april 19 , 2015 the @entity6 reaction was swift			1
on sunday , the @entity4 ambassador to @entity6 , @entity65 , was called to the @entity75 in a formal act of protest on the 72nd anniversary of the @entity68			1
@entity65 , a well - liked figure in @entity6 , went into damage - control mode			1
' saying that @entity6 and any other country other than @entity15 were responsible for the @entity8 is a mistake , is harmful and is offensive , ' @entity65 said			1
' @entity83 certainly did not mean to suggest that @entity6 was in any way responsible for those crimes			0
' in @entity88 , @entity87 spokeswoman @entity86 later echoed that sentiment , saying that ' @entity6 certainly bore a huge brunt of the barbarism of @entity15			1
' ' @entity83 certainly did not intend to suggest otherwise , did not intend to suggest that @entity6 was in some way responsible for the @entity8 , ' she said			0
the @entity1 had no immediate comment on the matter			0
@entity6 leaders all had something to say about the controversy			0
' to those who are incapable of presenting the historic truth in an honest way , i want to say that @entity6 was not a perpetrator but a victim of @entity39 , ' prime minister @entity99 said on sunday			2
' i would expect full historical knowledge from officials who speak on the matter			0
' not all @entity6 behaved heroically during the war			2
anti-semitism was deep in the 1930s and some @entity6 pointed @entity38 out to the @entity112 , who often could not tell @entity38 from @entity113			0
there were also some cases of @entity6 murdering @entity38 during the war			2
but collaborating was never the official state position , as it was with @entity119 , for instance			0
in fact , during the war , the @entity6 underground army had a program to save @entity38 , called @entity125			2
and @entity6 caught denouncing @entity38 to the @entity112 were even killed by the @entity6 resistance			0
president @entity127 caused a similar controversy in 2012 when he used the wording ' @entity6 death camp			1
' @entity6 feel that that wording implies @entity6 complicity , and @entity127 later expressed ' regret ' for the gaffe			1
' in referring to ' a @entity6 death camp ' rather than ' a @entity15 death camp in @entity138 - occupied @entity6 , ' i inadvertently used a phrase that has caused many @entity6 anguish over the years and that @entity6 has rightly campaigned to eliminate from public discourse around the world , ' @entity127 wrote at the time			1
' i regret the error and agree that this moment is an opportunity to ensure that this and future generations know the truth			0
' the entrance to the @entity36 death camp in @entity151 , @entity6			1
there was a @entity6 program to save @entity38 , called @entity125 , and @entity6 caught denouncing @entity38 to the @entity112 were even killed by the @entity6 resistance			0

@entity1 director @entity0 suggested in remarks last week that @entity6 were accomplices during the *holocaust*
@entity0 's comments are offensive to @entity6 as they had no role in running death camps and were themselves victims of the @entity15
@entity6 see themselves as heroes of the war who have never been properly recognized , making the comments yet more hurtful
the remarks came *shortly* before the 72nd anniversary of the @entity68 , which was commemorated on sunday
the @entity4 ambassador to @entity6 , @entity65 , was called to the @entity75 in a formal act of protest
the *incident* echoes a gaffe by president @entity127 in 2012 when he referred to ' a @entity6 death camp ' - he offered his regrets for the error
