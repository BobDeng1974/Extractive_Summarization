relevant : @entity0 the naturalist who set out the theory of evolution darwinian ' survival - of - the - fittest ' laws continue to shape human evolution in the modern age , research has found			0
humans are subject to the forces of natural selection just like any other species , say scientists			1
human customs such as marriage have not slowed the drive of natural selection - and men are evolving traits to increase their mating success , which could include such factors as good looks or even intelligence which might help them achieve success this is because mating with more partners increases the chance of reproductive success for a man - whereas it does n't for a woman			1
a popular misconception is that humans stopped evolving when they took up farming and embraced monogamy			0
but evidence from detailed church records of almost 6,000 @entity37 born between 1760 and 1849 suggests this is not so			0
researchers looked at economic status , births , deaths and marriages to examine four key natural selection factors			1
they were survival to adulthood , mate access , mating success and fertility			1
they found that the @entity37 ' natural selection opportunities were on a par with those seen in the wild			2
@entity54 has some of the best available data for such research thanks to detailed church records of births , deaths , marriages and wealth status which were kept for tax purposes			2
movement in the country was also very limited until the 20th century			0
differences in early survival and fertility were responsible for most of the variation in fitness , even among wealthy individuals			0
dr @entity71 , from the @entity73 's department of animal and plant sciences , said : ' we have shown advances have not challenged the fact that our species is still evolving , just like all the other species " in the wild "			0
men are evolving to be more attractive : this is because mating with more partners increases the chance of reproductive success for a man - whereas it does n't for a woman current : @entity0 made many of his great discoveries studying animals of the @entity93 ' it is a common misunderstanding that evolution took place a long time ago , and that to understand ourselves we must look back to the hunter - gatherer days of humans			1
' dr @entity71 said evidence had already proved important selection had been taking place in very recent populations			1
she said : ' humans continue to be affected by both natural and sexual selection			2
' although the specific pressures , the factors making some individuals able to survive better , or have better success at finding partners and produce more kids , have changed across time and differ in different populations			0
' the new findings are published in the journal @entity118			0
co-author dr @entity119 , from the @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity122 , said : ' characteristics increasing the mating success of men are likely to evolve faster than those increasing the mating success of women			1
' this is because mating with more partners was shown to increase reproductive success more in men than in women			1
' surprisingly , however , selection affected wealthy and poor people in the society to the same extent			2

characteristics changing ' mating success ' of men changing faster than those that affect women
men evolving attractive traits of looks and success to have more partners
having more partners ensures @entity153 passes on
@entity155 studying people in @entity54 find evidence that natural selection is still taking place
researchers say being rich or poor does not affect success at mating or fertility rates
