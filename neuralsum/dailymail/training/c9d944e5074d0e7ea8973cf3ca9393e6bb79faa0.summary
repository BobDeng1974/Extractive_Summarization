@entity0 , 51 , set up bank accounts and online @entity4 accounts in the name of his ex-wife before swindling cash of friends , family and his partner a fraudster who swindled nearly £ 2million from his in - laws , friends and new partner in a @entity15 - style sports betting scheme which funded his gambling addiction , luxury holidays and mortgage , has been jailed for seven years			1
@entity0 , 51 , set up bank accounts and online @entity4 accounts in the name of his ex-wife @entity20 and convinced her father and grandfather to part with their cash for the ' scheme '			1
the 51 - year - old financial adviser , from @entity27 , @entity28 , promised investors he had found a ' magic formula ' , which would guarantee huge , risk - free profits if they signed up			2
however , he instead conned them out of hundreds of thousands of pounds including his father - in - law who lost £ 145,000 , his grandfather - in - law who lost £ 2,000 and his new partner who was swindled out of £ 800,000			2
in total , he used his trusted position as a member of the family or as financial adviser to trick over 30 people into handing money in the so - called ' foolproof ' online football betting scheme between 2008 and 2011			2
instead of investing the money as promised , he withdrew the cash immediately , splurging it on home refurbishments , holidays , shopping and fine wines			1
his spending included £ 31,000 to pay off his mortgage , £ 7,000 for school fees , £ 15,000 for home improvements , £ 31,000 on leisure activities and holidays , £ 46,000 on shopping and £ 8,000 on fine wines			1
during the swindle , he declared he had no income on his tax returns			0
wearing a grey shirt and a beige blazer , he showed no emotion in the dock as he was sentenced at @entity63 to six years for fraud charges and one year for unauthorised regulated activity , to run consecutively , on friday			2
sentencing him , judge @entity66 said : ' the type and nature are extremely serious fraud offences breaching the trust of family and friends			0
' i 've been told it 's all to do with your gambling			1
' those involved have been affected to a lesser and greater degree by your fraud and complete dishonesty			0
' @entity81 said you 've completely destroyed her life			0
' @entity83 said : " what you 've done so brazenly and dishonestly is hard to come to terms with "			0
' the court heard how his ex-wife 's grandfather @entity87 was one of the first investors to sign up to the scheme , losing £ 2,000 , while her father @entity91 lost £ 145,000 , forcing him out of his retirement and back into full - time employment to try and make ends meet			1
in total , @entity0 lost £ 1.8million of the £ 2.3million pounds given to him to ' invest ' securely by nine friends and family members , frittering it away betting on sports , dog and horse racing and traditional casino events			2
he withdrew some funds to pay ' dividends ' to his investors to fool them into thinking the collective investment scheme was profitable and had his then - wife and a new partner fooled too , the court heard			1
mrs @entity110 previously told how she was ' swept off her feet ' when she met her husband , who is 13 years her senior , at @entity113 in 2004			2
the seven - year marriage ended when his scheming , implicating her , was uncovered in 2011 , and the pair remain separated but not yet divorced			0
he immediately left the family home in @entity118 , @entity119 , where the couple lived with their two children and moved to @entity123 in @entity27 , @entity28			0
mrs @entity110 , 37 , previously appeared in the dock alongside her former husband , charged with aiding and abetting him , but judge @entity126 told her this would lie on file			0
she was described as ' completely innocent ' regarding what her husband was up to , saying her ex-partner 's explanations of his fail - safe betting system was ' all @entity133 ' to her			0
@entity0 ( left ) and his ex-wife @entity20 ( pictured right at an earlier court hearing ) both attended @entity63 , where @entity0 admitted using bank and @entity4 accounts in his ex-wife 's name to con people her ex-husband had complete access to her finances , opening bank accounts in her name to which she never had access , the court heard			1
the mother of two said she had been duped just like the investors , had never used the @entity4 gambling site herself and did n't even know the passwords to the accounts			1
mr @entity0 convinced his investors to part with more cash by telling them he had been offered @entity4 shares at a preferential rate because he was such a good customer			1
prosecuting , @entity157 said : ' it was simply a complete and utter fiction			0
' he told people he had discovered a ' magic formula			0
of course , there was no secret formula			0
' when his spending caught up with him and the ruse became untenable in march 2011 , @entity0 sent an email to many of his investors saying a ' disastrous sequence of events , ' meant he had lost all their money by pressing a ' wrong button ' on the computer while betting			1
the conman then said the only way he would be able to win back their money would be if they invested a further £ 100,000 in a new fund , which he promised would give 100 per cent returns			0
most of his victims began to fear they had been defrauded on a monumental scale , but incredibly some continued to give persuasive @entity0 their money - including 71 - year - old @entity183 , who had been introduced to @entity0 through his father			1
the lonely and vulnerable woman became close to @entity0 after her husband died in november 2008 , leaving her with property and significant finances			2
she was said to have felt sorry for @entity0 for losing his money and his wife			1
the pair started a romantic relationship , during which time @entity0 invested over £ 800,000 of her money and set up @entity4 accounts in her name , as he had done previously under his ex-wife 's name			1
some £ 665,000 of this money was lost through gambling and theft , leaving elderly mrs @entity183 ' knocked for six , ' with debts , a shattered credit rating , and her family without an inheritance			2
' looking back , mr @entity0 must have thought i was sitting on a fortune , ' she said			2
@entity0 admitted the charges at @entity63 ( pictured ) and was sentenced to seven years in prison friend @entity81 invested £ 390,000 and lost £ 260,000 to @entity0 , while @entity210 invested £ 65,000 and lost £ 51,000			1
defending , @entity211 said a repentant @entity0 had a ' long - standing ' gambling problem for which he had been receiving treatment during his three years on bail			1
' he now knows it ( the betting scheme ) was wholly optimistic and was always doomed to fail , ' he said			0
' the problem with gamblers is they bury their head in the sand trying to chase their losses to try and make a profit			0
' at an earlier hearing mrs @entity110 was found liable for hundreds of thousands of pounds when family friend , @entity224 sued for the £ 300,000 she had invested in the @entity15 - style scheme			0
last march , judge @entity226 cleared the @entity123 - based tv producer of any dishonesty but ruled that she would still have to cover the costs of mr @entity0 's losses in her name			1
she took it to the @entity233 in december but three top judges ruled against her			0
mr @entity0 was handed down a six - year jail sentence for fraud and one year for unauthorised regulated activity for carrying out financial activity while banned , to run consecutively			1
