mr @entity6 , a freelance journalist now based in @entity62 , explained : ' the very sad subtext to this all , and the reason why i visited the orphanages , is that many families in @entity5 , particularly in the rural areas that were sprayed with @entity4 are too poor to carry the burden of a disabled child , and so abandon them at orphanages			2
the majority of children at @entity10 orphanage in @entity12 were abandoned by their parents who could not afford to care for them the children at the orphanages stay there until they are 17			0
after that they are then sent to adult care homes a teenage boy sits in the corner of one of the wards at the @entity84			0
