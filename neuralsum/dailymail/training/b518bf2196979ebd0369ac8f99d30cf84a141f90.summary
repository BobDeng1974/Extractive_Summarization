the debate was always going to catch up with @entity1 eventually but his two goals in @entity3 have accelerated the process even before his @entity6 debut			1
@entity1 ’s first appearance for @entity9 ’s side is likely to be against @entity10 at the @entity11 on saturday but his move to @entity13 has left a sore festering in the red half of the same northern city			2
one of their own has gone			0
@entity20 born , @entity19 bred in the @entity22 way , tipped for great things from an early age and sold even though he was not battering down the door to get out			1
@entity27 and @entity28 have allowed him to join a direct top - four rival , without ever knowing how good he was or can be , and without ever giving him an extended run in the central position he prefers			0
@entity48 @entity1 's record with @entity34 is much better than his league record for former club @entity22			1
he scores goals more regularly for his country and is far more clinical			0
apps : 28 for country / 92 for club goals : 10 / 20 goals / game : 0.36 / 0.22 mins / goal : 171.40 / 253.20 shot conversion : 24.39 / 16.26 the time to judge the winners and losers in this fascinating piece of deadline - day business will be at the end of the season but his @entity34 double in @entity70 , playing up front with @entity72 , provided ammunition for those who suspect @entity22 have erred			1
‘ i would like to have still seen @entity1 as a @entity22 player , ’ said former captain @entity75 , speaking at the @entity77 conference in @entity20 on tuesday			1
‘ that is one move i would not have done			0
he ’ll give everything and it ’s a great signing			0
’ it is as if @entity1 represented more than his qualities as a footballer			1
@entity85 , another former @entity22 player and sir @entity87 ’s assistant for many years , claimed it was a sign the club was losing its identity ; an identity built on the @entity92			1
‘ he can really play , ’ said @entity93 , who trained and played alongside @entity1 for three years			1
‘ but try getting in the team there			0
there are so many good players			0
a lot of the time when @entity1 did play , he played on the left or the right but , as his @entity34 record suggests , when he is played in the middle , he can score goals			1
it could be one of the signings of the summer			2
’ club class : striker @entity1 completed his move from @entity22 to @entity6 on transfer deadline day tip : @entity111 's @entity110 hailed @entity6 ’s new signing as the ‘ bargain of the century ’ at £ 16million it took a big - money transfer at the age of 23 for @entity117 to trigger his stunning improvement			1
similarly , @entity1 is 23 and has just completed a £ 16million move from @entity22 to @entity6			1
@entity117 , now 25 , has 36 goals from 52 games since joining @entity122			0
so is @entity1 ready for a goals glut of his own ? his record would suggest not ; with 37 goals in 178 club career games			1
@entity1 now has 10 @entity34 goals , though			1
at the same age , @entity128 had one cap and no goals			0
and now he will finally get his wish to play as a striker			0
by @entity135 's @entity134 statistics may drive @entity32 into a four - letter fury , but @entity1 ’s are fascinating			2
his international goal - per - minute ratio puts him up with @entity34 ’s best and , at 23 , he is the same age as @entity128 when the prolific striker was still searching for his first international goal			1
@entity1 is in double figures			2
@entity144 came against @entity145 and @entity146 but he has important goals , too , as against @entity148 in @entity149 , and in @entity3			1
@entity110 hailed @entity6 ’s new signing as the ‘ bargain of the century ’ at £ 16million while former @entity34 captain @entity152 claimed : ‘ @entity22 will regret selling @entity1 to @entity6			1
’ this suggestion was put to @entity72 as he emerged relieved and triumphant from the dressing rooms in @entity70 ’s @entity155			0
‘ it was his decision , ’ shrugged the @entity34 captain			1
‘ he ’s at @entity6 now and so i wish him the best of luck			1
@entity1 is a fantastic footballer			2
he ’ll score goals if he gets chances			0
’ you can like our @entity163 here good news for everyone ! here 's @entity111 's stats ! with goals comes confidence and with confidence come more goals			2
‘ the point is he was playing up front , ’ said @entity32			2
‘ not having to think so hard about the things we want him to do when he plays wide			2
‘ when he plays wide we put a lot of emphasis on him reading the game , tucking in at the right moments , going forward at the right moment			0
playing up front frees him to play in what he considers to be his best position			0
’ coaches adore @entity1 because he can listen and carry out instructions and is a willing grafter in defensive areas			1
it was for this reason @entity87 chose him to stop @entity195 when @entity22 played @entity196			2
@entity1 had been identified early			2
they knew something special was coming through the ranks			0
when @entity200 scored a glut of goals on loan at @entity204 in 2008 - 09 he was not rushed back because the feeling was that @entity1 would be better			1
in his second autobiography , published last year , @entity87 put him on a par with anything coming out of @entity210 ’s academy at the same time			0
perhaps this is why @entity1 ’s exit is like a bitter pill at @entity19			2
he was released too willingly , to make room for @entity215 , a @entity216 on loan with a spectacular goal record to match his spectacular wages and who is untried in @entity222 football			0
@entity215 may sell more shirts and attract more sponsors			0
he may score more goals			0
but he also signifies a break from the past for a club which conquered the world by growing its own			0
the debate will continue to orbit @entity1			0
the two teams meet at @entity6 in november			0
just the beginning : @entity1 can use his move to @entity6 to kick on and flourish for club and country video @entity6 spending does n't guarantee success - @entity238			1

@entity1 joined @entity6 from @entity22 on transfer deadline day for £ 16million
the striker scored two goals against @entity3 on monday night
@entity1 was born and bred in @entity20 and tipped for great things
@entity93 : ' it could be one of the signings of the summer ’
@entity110 called it the ‘ bargain of the century ’ while former @entity34 captain @entity152 claimed : ‘ @entity22 will regret selling @entity1 '
