by @entity0 published : 11:27 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 11:26 est , 1 november 2013 an astonishing suggestion was put forward today that the four @entity3 hostages freed this week could have been ‘ islamised ' during their time in captivity			1
the claim emerged during an interview with far - right politician @entity8 , leader of the @entity9			1
@entity10 , 28 , @entity11 , 32 , @entity12 , 62 , and @entity13 , 46 were all captured in september 2010 during raids on a uranium mine near @entity16 , northern @entity17 , where they were working for nuclear giant @entity19			1
the four released by @entity27 may have been ' islamized ' like the anti-hero in the tv series @entity30 , it was suggested today the four men , who were held in @entity17 four more than three years , looked uncomfortably @entity32 when they got back to @entity3 on wednesday			1
ms @entity33 said she was ‘ uneasy ’ about the look the four men who were photographed arriving back on @entity3 soil			1
asked on @entity3 radio to explain exactly what she meant , ms @entity33 said : ‘ you understand perfectly well what i ’m saying , because i think many @entity3 people felt the same way			2
overjoyed : @entity12 is greeted by family members after being held in captivity for three years unanswered questions : the reunion came amid claims that more than £ 17million was paid for their release extreme : @entity3 far - right @entity50 president @entity8 made the claims in an interview ‘ they appeared very hesitant and reserved			1
two had their beards trimmed in an astonishing way			0
and their clothes were very strange			0
’ ms @entity33 pointed to one of the men wearing an @entity61 scarf over his face , saying ‘ all of this deserves a few explanations from them			2
’ asked directly if she thought the men – who had all been working for nuclear giant @entity19 – had been ‘ islamized ’ , ms @entity33 said : ‘ no , look , i ’m not a psychiatrist			0
i ’m just expressing to you how i felt , and i think it was shared by a certain number of @entity3 people			2
‘ i ’m not going to go as far as coming up with theories , that would n’t be my place			0
’ her suggestion draws comparisons with @entity78 television show homeland in which @entity80 actor @entity79 plays a @entity78 soldier who spends so long in @entity27 captivity that he returns to @entity78 as an @entity32 terrorist			0
it came as mr @entity23 ’s government continued to insist that no ransom was paid , while a well - placed source told @entity88 that more than 17 million pounds worth of cash came from ‘ secret funds allocated to the intelligence services ’			0
suggestions : in homeland , @entity80 actor @entity79 plays a @entity78 soldier who spends so long in @entity27 captivity that he returns to @entity78 as an @entity32 terrorist hostage for three years : @entity3 nuclear worker @entity10 ( centre in scarf ) arrives at @entity100 's airport in @entity17 with @entity3 defence minister @entity101 ( left ) after being freed by @entity27 ' @entity102 ' : @entity11 ( centre ) and @entity12 ( right ) were among four @entity3 working for nuclear giant @entity19 when they was snatched by @entity27 in a raid on a uranium mine in @entity17 @entity107 and @entity78 have repeatedly warned against paying ransoms , saying it will encourage terrorism			1
@entity111 leaders who met in @entity112 in june signed an agreement to ‘ unequivocally reject the payment of ransoms to terrorists ’ but did not impose a formal ban			0
@entity107 officials said at the time that @entity27 - linked groups around the world had made some 70 million dollars from hostages over the last two years			2
fearing for their lives : this image from september last year shows the men appearing in videos uploaded to the @entity127 news website @entity128 when they were held in captivity by @entity27 @entity130 , the former @entity78 ambassador to @entity131 , said ransom payments were ‘ helping @entity132 ( @entity132 – the group which captured and held the @entity3 ) to grow strong , buy weapons and recruit			1
’ and @entity135 , a senior research fellow in counter-terrorism at the @entity137 , said : ‘ the @entity78 gets very angry about this ... some of the @entity141 governments have been seen as softer on this issue			0
’ mr @entity135 added : ‘ the long - term effects of this are that , first , the groups will probably do it again and second , it gives the organisation money			0
’ @entity149 dream : their release is a welcome boost for @entity23 , a day after a poll showed he is the most unpopular president in @entity3 history supporting them to the very end : families , friends and activists demonstrating in @entity161 en @entity162 , southern @entity3 , in june to mark 1,000 days since the four @entity3 hostages were kidnapped			2
