by @entity0 published : 11:31 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 18:25 est , 20 february 2013 when these conifers were first planted in a front garden on a residential street , the neighbour next door fondly hoped they might be miniatures			1
but 30ft later , it ’s abundantly clear that the trees are full - size – and after 17 years the dispute between the two homes has escalated to the point where the families only communicate by letter			0
furious @entity14 , 55 , is at war with @entity17 , 59 , who has let the trees grow so high they completely obscure his house from the road in @entity21 , @entity22			1
' private forest ' : the 30ft conifers outside @entity17 's house in @entity21 , @entity22 outrage : neighbour @entity14 , pictured outside his own house , is up in arms about the oversized trees the roots of the row go back to 1996 , when mr @entity14 asked his neighbours if they could uproot a dividing hedge and build a wall to separate the two homes			1
mr @entity14 paid for a contractor to remove the hedge and offered to buy the @entity38 mini-conifers by way of compensation , an offer that was turned down			1
however , some months later the @entity42 noticed that conifers had been planted in their neighbours ’ garden and it soon became apparent that they were not miniatures			0
a laurel tree also in the front garden has been cut back at mr @entity14 ’s request but has grown back again			2
' intrusion ' : mr @entity14 claims mr @entity17 's trees , right , have a damaging effect on his house , left feud : the next - door neighbours no longer talk and communicate their anger by letter now former miner mr @entity14 is preparing to launch a legal battle to have the trees cut down to size			1
last night he said : ‘ it ’s an eyesore			0
we cut it on our side but there ’s only so far we can reach			0
‘ we do n’t open our front curtains any more because then we have n’t got to face it			0
’ but mr @entity17 ’s son @entity69 , 29 , said : ‘ the trees do n’t affect their light			2
’ he added : ‘ when i come outside to have a cigarette , it ’s like being in your own private forest			1
’ @entity79 planning projects officer @entity78 said mr @entity14 has been told he could make a formal complaint to the council asking for officers to investigate			2
he said : ‘ mr @entity14 chose not to pursue this matter and the council have had no further contact from him about this point			0
