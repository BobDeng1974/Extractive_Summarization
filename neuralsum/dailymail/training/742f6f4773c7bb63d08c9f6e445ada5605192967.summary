by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 07:03 est , 30 august 2012 updated : 02:26 est , 31 august 2012 @entity2 is contemplating a £ 200,000 - an - hour job with banking giant @entity4			1
if the former @entity6 president accepts the job with @entity4 he will be following a similarly lucrative path to the one trodden by his old friend and former @entity11 prime minister @entity10 , who earns millions in his role as an advisor to investment bank @entity14			1
but critics on the other side of the @entity18 have already expressed disgust at once - elected politicians effectively using their reputations to enrich themselves to the tune of millions			0
lucrative : former @entity6 president @entity2 , left , is said to be mulling over an offer from @entity4			1
@entity10 , the former @entity11 prime minister , right , has amassed a fortune since he left the post in 2007 since quitting as @entity10 in 2007 , mr @entity10 has bought at least six homes , travels the world by private jet , and has an income of at least £ 20 million a year			1
around £ 2.5 million of that comes from his role as an advisor to the @entity34 investment bank @entity14			1
leisure time : @entity2 was pictured on holiday in @entity37 in the south of @entity6 earlier this month according to the @entity6 investigative weekly @entity39 , @entity4 has offered mr @entity2 a quarter of a million euros for one hour 's work			1
he will be expected to make a speech of 45 minutes and then pose for pictures for a further 15			0
the controversial mr @entity2 is currently facing a number of corruption allegations in @entity6 , including claims that he accepted illegal cash payments from @entity47 , the @entity49 heiress and @entity6 's richest woman			2
but the conservative politician 's five years spent running @entity6 are considered of huge interest to international companies , and mr @entity2 is in a good position to exploit this			2
the offer from @entity4 is far more than the £ 17,000 odd a month he earned as president , but it is still a lot less than the fees mr @entity10 can command			2
referring to mr @entity2 , @entity6 agent @entity61 , said : ' as a head hunter i can see why a company would spend so much money for ( mr @entity2 's ) economic expertise			0
' but mr @entity61 added : ' this is a very taboo subject in @entity6 at the moment			0
you will never get a former president boasting of having sold his services to a company as it would offend public opinion			0
' mr @entity10 has regularly been accused of abusing his former position to make massive profits			0
he also runs a financial advisory service , @entity77 , which has deals with the oil and gas - rich governments of @entity82 and @entity83 and sovereign wealth funds in @entity85 and @entity86			0
before the murder of @entity88 during the @entity89 , mr @entity10 regularly met the dictator in @entity91 , and advised companies on how to make money in the oil - rich country			0
mr @entity10 , who speaks @entity6 , has been a frequent visitor to @entity1 over the years , both officially and as a friend of mr @entity2 's			2
neither have commented on the claims in the latest edition of @entity99 time is money : the banking giant has offered mr @entity2 a quarter of a million euros for one hours work			1

@entity4 has offered the former @entity6 president a quarter of a million euros for one hour of work
former @entity11 *pm* @entity10 earns around £ 2.5 million from his role as an advisor to rival firm @entity14
