few might expect the 58 - year - old to instead be living beneath a @entity8 freeway , homeless , while feared to be suffering a lasting affect by the professional sport : brain damage			2
today the former linebacker for the @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 appears frail though as his former 49ers roommate @entity17 says , still ' very proud			1
mr @entity17 , who played alongside mr @entity4 until his own career was ended early due to a series of concussions , successfully sued the @entity3 for workers compensation after a gruelling battle			1
he has had nine brain surgeries since , pointing to a hidden tube running through the side of his head to a pump in one instance , and says he could require more			2
' none of us want to ask for help , but there ’s some things that he ’s earned , ' mr @entity17 said of his old friend whom he 's since encouraged to be tested for similar injuries			2
mr @entity4 however has acknowledged that a similar blow to his own head , making him what he called ‘ a paper head , ’ is what ended his career			1
he says he never reported the injury to the @entity3 , though it was enough to make him quit , fearing he could end up paralyzed if hit just one more time			1
@entity62 : in his daughter 's home photos of the father and twice married husband are seen with his children as well as a team photo of his days with the 49ers full responsibility : he admits his concussion causing him to quit the @entity3 , fearing he could become paralyzed if hit just one more time , but refuses to blame the sport on his life 's troubles since ending his @entity3 career in the 1980 , mr @entity4 has run through two failed marriages , suffers anger problems he ’s seen counselling for and has been in and out of homelessness			1
they 're all clear signs of brain damage according to doctors			0
' i had stayed with friends now and then but i did n't want to burden them , ' he told @entity35 of his decision to move beneath the overpass			0
when asked how others living beneath there reacted to hearing that he was once a @entity3 star , he interrupts to say : ' oh , i did n't tell them			1
' reaching out : mr @entity4 's former 49ers roommate @entity17 has undergone nine brain surgeries since his own leave from the @entity3 prompting him to motivate his old friend to see a doctor repercussions : mr @entity17 successfully sued the @entity3 for workers compensation after his injuries that in one surgery required a tube , he gestures on his head 's right side , to be inserted along with a pump his physical injuries are a bit different , though ones he mutually tries to get by with			1
holding out his hands , his fingers are permanently bent , unable to stretch them out straight			0
he admits to having exited games and taping them up himself , not seeking medical treatment like most players more readily see today			2
' getting old , things are breaking down , but it ’s all due to me , you know , ' he said			0
' maybe it speeded up because of football			0
' in a rare moment revealing his vulnerability , standing beside that overpass he asks the @entity35 reporter quizzically : ' do you think something 's wrong with me ? ' @entity127 : among mr @entity4 's other injuries , his hands are visibly skewed after merely wrapping his fingers in tape after games rather than his injuries addressed by doctors @entity135 to pay : after visiting a doctor with mr @entity17 , mr @entity4 , seen center during his @entity3 hay - day , says he has n't ruled out having a full assessment done but he 's still not sure it 'd be worth the financial burden that little bit of doubt is what led him to a doctor at mr @entity17 's imploring side			1
' any concerns at all about how you feel or how you function , ' dr @entity147 asks him with the @entity35 reporter in the room			0
' ah , no. nope , ' mr @entity4 quietly replies			2
he did n't open up to the doctors that day but since leaving the office he has told @entity35 he has n't ruled out the possibility of having a full assessment			0
