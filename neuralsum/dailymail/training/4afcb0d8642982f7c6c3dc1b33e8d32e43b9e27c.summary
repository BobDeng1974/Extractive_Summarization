in the future , those with hearing loss may no longer need a cochlear implant - instead they could hear with their mouths			1
at least , that 's the vision of a group of @entity9 researchers who are developing a hearing device that bypasses the ear altogether			0
the technology relies on a @entity14 - enabled earpiece to detect sound and send electrical impulses to an electrode - packed retainer that wearers press their tongue against to ' hear			1
professor @entity34 came up with the idea for the device during what he calls a ' research midlife crisis ' , when he also developed tinnitus - a constant , high - pitched ringing in his ears			0
he hit upon the idea that the tongue contains thousands of nerves and the region of the brain that interprets touch sensations from the tongue is capable of decoding complicated information			2
' what we are trying to do is another form of sensory substitution , ' professor @entity34 said			0
unlike hearing aids , which amplify sound , cochlear implants circumvent damaged areas of the ear and stimulate the auditory nerve directly			0
professor @entity34 ( pictured ) from @entity35 came up with the idea for the device during what he calls a ' research midlife crisis ' microphones outside the ear detect sounds and send them to a speech processor , which analyses the information and transmits it to a receiver where it is converted into electric impulses			2
a microphone attached to a @entity14 earpiece detects sounds and words from the environment			1
these sounds are transmitted to a receiver where they are converted to distinct patterns that represent a word			0
the receiver / processor sends these patterns of electric impulses to the electrode - dense retainer fitted to the roof of the mouth			1
the wearer presses his tongue to the retainer to feel the distinct pattern			2
with training , the brain is able to ' hear ' or interpret that pattern and understand words being spoken			1
the implant sends those impulses directly to the auditory nerve			0
with training , the brain learns to recognise these impulses as useful sound information			1
the @entity9 device operates in the same way except electric impulses are sent via @entity14 to a retainer - like mouthpiece packed with electrodes			1
when users press their tongue against the device , they feel a distinct pattern of electric impulses as a tingling or vibrating sensation			2
the idea is that , with training , the brain will learn to interpret specific patterns as words , thus allowing someone to ' hear ' with their tongue			1
the concept is not as far fetched as it first sounds			0
@entity125 can identify specific words from the series of black lines on a sonogram			0
and people who lose their sight can learn to ' read ' words again with @entity133			0
when users press their tongue against the device , they feel a distinct pattern of electric impulses as a tingling or vibrating sensation			2
the idea is that , with training , the brain will learn to interpret specific patterns as words , thus allowing someone to ' hear ' with their tongue the notion that the human brain is ' set ' by adulthood and therefore , unable to change how it receives and interprets information is inaccurate , said @entity151 , assistant professor in the @entity152 and @entity153			1
' we have a remarkable amount of plasticity in our brain even as adults , ' she said			0
' we now know that is able to make changes and adapt to changes in incoming information , especially stimuli that are of importance to the individual			0
' professor @entity34 and @entity166 , a @entity35 graduate student , have spent the past year building and testing prototypes of the technology			1
their initial results are promising enough that they have filed a provisional patent for the technology and launched @entity173 , a start - up company , to help advance the technology			1
professor @entity34 and his team believe that , once refined , their technology could turn the world of hearing devices on its ear .			0

the technology relies on a @entity14 - enabled earpiece to detect sound
it sends impulses to a retainer that wearers press their tongue against
with training , the brain is able to ' hear ' or interpret the patterns used
the team have spent a year building the technology and filed a patent
