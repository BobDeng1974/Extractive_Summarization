by @entity1 reporter published : 09:33 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 10:57 est , 30 august 2013 a brother and his sister are suing an @entity5 hospital after a nurse accidentally threw away a kidney he had donated to save her life			1
surgeons at the @entity10 removed the organ from @entity12 on august 10 , 2012 to give it to his then 24 - year - old sister @entity13 - but a nurse , @entity14 , threw it away as she discarded the contents of a slush machine before the operation was over			1
doctors tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate the organ for two hours after the accident was discovered			0
after consulting with the family , physicians decided not to risk using the kidney because they thought it was likely another compatible donor could be found			1
@entity27 , @entity41 , their parents , and their four siblings filed a lawsuit on july 29 against @entity10 in the @entity43 in @entity44 individually demand $ 25,000 , plus interest and the costs of the suit			1
their attorney @entity48 said @entity10 had been accommodating after the mix up but that the @entity5 attorney general â€™s office , which represents @entity10 , would not accept some of the family 's demands			2
on tuesday , the medical center responded to the @entity12 family lawsuit , acknowledging the organ was discarded but denying some of the @entity58 claims , the @entity53 reported			2
suing : the siblings ' parents , @entity61 and @entity12 ( pictured ) , are also named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit it did not ask the court to dismiss the charge of criminal negligence , but did dispute the family 's claim that there was a ' parental loss of consortium ' and ' sibling loss of consortium ' - the legal terms for when an incident affects relationships			1
surgeon : dr @entity78 continues to work at the hospital but two nurses have been fired there is ' no right to compensation for parental loss of consortium of an adult , ' it said			0
' there is no right to compensation for sibling loss of consortium in a non-death case			0
' @entity94 , the university 's vice president for external affairs , said he did not know how much the medical center paid the family , including the cost of the trip to @entity36			1
after the mix - up , live - donor kidney transplants were suspended voluntarily at the medical center - and there was a host of staff changes			2
dr. @entity78 , who performed the surgery , still works at the medical center while two nurses , @entity14 and @entity109 , no longer work there and the administrator of surgical services , @entity111 , was placed on paid administrative leave			2
@entity14 , who threw away the slush machine contents before the surgery was over , resigned on september 10 last year , while the hospital fired @entity109 , a full - time nurse			1
@entity109 , who took over when @entity14 went on a lunch break , did not update her on the status of the surgery when she returned from her break , disciplinary records showed , the @entity53 reported			0
she has now sued the hospital for wrongful discharge , defamation , slander , and libel and seeks damages exceeding $ 25,000			0
disastrous error : an investigation is underway at the @entity10 after a nurse accidentally disposed of a kidney a man donated for his sick sister humans do not need two kidneys to live , the body can support life with only one			1
if one functional kidney is missing from birth , the other kidney can grow to reach a size similar to the combined weight of two kidneys this kind of accident is unheard of in organ transplant centers and it was a good decision not to use the kidney , dr @entity141 , director of kidney transplantation at @entity143 , told the @entity53			0
' this is unfortunately what medicine is like - it is not perfect , and there have been far worse cases where the donor has died , ' @entity141 said			0
there were 16,816 kidney transplants nationwide last year from live donors and from those who consented to organ donation through state registries should they die from an illness or accident , the newspaper reported			0
last year , 136 people in @entity5 died waiting for a kidney , and 4,711 people died nationally waiting for a kidney , the newspaper reported .			0

@entity168 donated his kidney to his sister @entity27 , 24 , in august 2012
but a nurse accidentally threw it away before the surgery was over
the hospital found a new kidney and paid @entity27 's travel costs so she could undergo the operation - and it is now trying to dismiss the lawsuit
