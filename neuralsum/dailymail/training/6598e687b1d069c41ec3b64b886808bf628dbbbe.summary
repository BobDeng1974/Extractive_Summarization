by @entity0 statement : @entity3 @entity2 , pictured arriving at @entity4 on friday , has spoken about her involvement in the @entity7 tax avoidance scheme chart star @entity2 has told how she was ' clueless and inexperienced ' when she followed the advice of experts to sign up to what turned out to be an aggressive tax avoidance scheme			1
the 29 year - old singer was among around 1,600 people who were involved with the controversial @entity7 tax strategy , but she went on to settle her tax in full with @entity16 when it was brought to her attention			1
opening up about the furore for the first time today , she admitted it ' sucks ' that she has been under the spotlight for her part in it , and called for such schemes to be stopped to prevent others from being advised by experts to take part			1
closest thing to crazy singer @entity2 was on a list of figures - including celebrities , doctors and judges - given to @entity35 after they put around £ 1.2 billion into the scheme from 2005 until 2009			2
the arrangement created a tax loss for investors which they could offset against other income			2
other celebrities have not responded to the claims that they were involved , but @entity2 was upfront and told how she pulled out as soon as she was made aware of the nature of the scheme and then paid her full tax liability			1
writing about the issue on her website today she explained : ' at 19 i was lucky enough to start making money from my music career , and when i was in my early twenties i trusted financial experts and advisors to guide me with how i invested money			1
' that i was fairly clueless and inexperienced when it came to finance goes without saying and , i 'm embarrassed to admit , not as interested in it as i should have been			0
my focus was , and still is , totally on making music , getting on the road and performing live			0
' from what i can remember in 2008 when the @entity7 scheme was presented to me it was not presented as " an aggressive tax avoidance scheme "			2
it was presented as an " investment scheme " that had the potential to legally reduce yearly income tax			0
totally legal and legit and my accountants and advisors would take care to complete the formalities which included dealing with @entity16			1
seemed pretty straight - forward and simple , so i signed up			0
' scheme : @entity74 has been named as one of 1,600 people who used the tax avoidance scheme @entity7 to shelter a total of £ 1.2bn			0
the scheme is legal but has been investigated for more than a decade @entity2 : ' my tax records are completely up to date and i do n't owe @entity16 any money ' she went on : ' @entity16 did later query it , and i paid the full amount of tax years ago			1
my tax records are completely up to date and i do n't owe @entity16 any money			1
' yeah it sucks getting this type of attention , but i commend the investigative journalism that is allowed in @entity89			0
' if there is ambiguity in the law then laws should be changed to disallow schemes like this , so that they would never be presented by legitimate tax experts to less experienced people like myself in the first place			2
