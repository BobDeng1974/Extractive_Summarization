@entity0 and @entity1 should be omitted from @entity3 's @entity2 to face @entity4 - according to the @entity6 's official player ranking index provided by @entity7			1
taking into account every second of every @entity12 player 's performances in the @entity6 this season , @entity7 have provided a balanced squad of the 23 most in - form players , and from that a best xi. @entity0 and @entity1 - the only representatives from the @entity19 clubs - make the squad but do not make the @entity16 scroll down to see the full @entity2 squad according to @entity22 @entity1 ( right ) helps his @entity2 team - mate @entity0 with cramp during sunday 's @entity25 @entity0 scored with a free - kick in his latest appearance for @entity2 against @entity28 in @entity29 @entity2 's best xi based on @entity31 the index has instead @entity34 's @entity33 starting ahead of @entity35 's @entity1 , while @entity37 's @entity36 and @entity39 's @entity38 are preferred to @entity40 's @entity0 up front			1
@entity38 - the highest - rated player in the squad - is one of three @entity39 players picked , making them the joint-most represented club along with @entity34 and @entity47			2
@entity35 and @entity40 , meanwhile , have the same number of representatives in the squad ( 1 ) as @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity37 and @entity53			0
just nine of @entity2 's @entity55 squad make the 23 , but the centre back pairing from @entity58 of @entity59 and @entity60 are retained in the @entity16 of @entity3 's last starting @entity16 , who played @entity28 last month , only four make the @entity16 @entity62 , who came off the bench in that match , is one star name who does make the cut , as does his @entity69 team - mate @entity68			1
there is no place in the squad for @entity73 , with @entity47 's @entity74 starting in midfield alongside @entity68			0
this squad will surely be widely different from @entity3 's - named on thursday for the qualifier on novermber 15 - but it certainly raises some interesting questions regarding selection			2
