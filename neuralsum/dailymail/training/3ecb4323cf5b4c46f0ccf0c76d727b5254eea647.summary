by @entity0 , @entity1 editor must - have gadgets that filled @entity4 homes in the @entity5 and @entity6 are making a comeback			2
retailers say a combination of a fondness for retro - chic and the effects of austerity have seen a boom in sales of the @entity16 and the @entity18 trolley			1
@entity20 fizzy drink makers are also enjoying a revival , joining electric heated rollers , electric carving knifes and electric blankets on @entity26 lists			1
then : the idea of the @entity16 was something of a hi - tech marvel when it hit popular culture in the late 1960s and through in to the 1970s now : sales of quieter , modern versions of the @entity16 , such as this £ 54.95 @entity33 are booming popular : sales of heated rollers are on the rise sales of heated trolleys , designed to keep food warm at dinner parties , are rising as more people eat at home rather than busting the family budget on dining out			1
increased thriftiness is also behind the renewed popularity of @entity46 , which save families money by letting them make fizzy drinks at a fraction of the supermarket price			1
tea - makers that combine an alarm clock , kettle and teapot to deliver a freshly brewed cuppa appeal to workers too busy to fit a sit - down breakfast into their morning routine			2
the original idea for an automated tea - maker dates back to 1891 but @entity62 did not become a fixture on wedding lists and in many bedrooms until the 1960s			1
although sales declined in the 1980s , one found its way into @entity70 when @entity71 was prime minister in the 1990s			1
the design has undergone a makeover since the 1970s , when 300,000 a year were sold			1
the most famous brand , @entity75 , has been taken over by @entity76			2
@entity77 says sales of the £ 54.95 @entity33 , said to be quieter than the old - fashioned @entity16 , are up by around 20 per cent on this time last year			1
@entity80 , electricals buyer at @entity77 , said : ‘ the classic @entity16 has done well because it is quite a quaint , almost comical , product			1
‘ the resurgence in popularity is a combination of the appreciation of the invention but also building a nostalgic concept			2
’ retro : @entity91 , which allow families to make their own fizzy water and drinks as a cheaper alternative to the real thing , are doing well @entity97 , commercial director of @entity98 , which manufactures @entity18 trolleys , said sales are up between 30 and 40 per cent this @entity26			1
‘ television programmes like @entity102 mean that people are noticing how important the way they serve food is , ’ she said			1
‘ in the last few years we have seen more of a focus on entertaining at home			1
’ @entity109 , managing director at @entity110 , said : ‘ people tend to look to brands which remind them of happy childhood experiences , but that also meet the demands of modern - day living practically and efficiently			1
‘ many may have had a @entity20 in the family when they were a child and are looking to replicate the experience with their own children			2
’ popular : television programmes such as @entity122 , which featured @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 in one episode , are thought to be behind the rise in gadgets geared towards entertaining at home by @entity132 today my day began , as it does every morning , at precisely 7am when my husband handed me a mug of scalding - hot tea			1
no , i ’m not lucky enough to have a spouse so devoted he ’ll go downstairs in the cold and dark to put on the kettle			2
until recently , this was my embarrassing little secret			0
tea - makers were old - fashioned , owned by pensioners , not young ( ish ) professionals			0
but now it appears that i am at the vanguard of a new trend			0
still working : a typical 1950 's bedside @entity16 and alarm i was n’t always such a convert , even though my grandparents had a @entity16 , with its characteristic art deco - style square kettle and pot. i have vivid memories of it sitting on a chair next to their bed , alongside the floral china cups and saucers – never mugs – they drank from			0
as a small child it was considered a treat to turn it on			0
still , when my husband , @entity165 , announced he wanted one for his birthday six years ago – while we were still in our early 30s – i teased him mercilessly and refused to get him anything so fuddy - duddy			0
his parents had to buy it for him			0
but i soon got used to waking to the sound of a click followed by gentle bubbling as the water started to heat			0
the process would end about a minute later in a loud ‘ whoosh ’ as boiling water , pressurised by its own steam , shot from a kettle compartment into a teapot via a metal spout			0
mugs had been primed with milk the evening before ( it rarely goes off overnight ) and , within seconds , tea was made			0
i started to take it for granted so when , about a year ago , our £ 50 @entity189 stopped heating water properly i encouraged @entity165 to buy a replacement			2
unable then to find another @entity16 , we ’ve since been using a @entity193 hot drinks maker , priced around £ 60			0
there ’s no teapot , and boiling water shoots straight into two cups , now ready with milk and a tea bag			0
while it produced a slightly ‘ plasticky ’ brew at the start , the tea now tastes fine , though @entity165 complains it produces far more steam			0
still , there ’s no chance of us returning to the bad old days of trudging downstairs and i wonder if we ’ll end up with grandchildren who will be , as i was all those years ago , transfixed by the magic of a @entity16 .			0

@entity77 say sales of modern @entity62 up 20per cent on last year
