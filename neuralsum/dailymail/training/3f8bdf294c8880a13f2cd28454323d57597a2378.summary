eight new planets have been discovered in the ' @entity2 ' zone of their stars , orbiting at a distance where oceans and life could exist			2
the discovery doubles the number of small planets less than twice the diameter of @entity11 which are believed to be in the habitable zone of their parent stars			1
among these eight , astronomers say there are two that are the most similar to @entity11 of any known exoplanets to date			1
pictured is an artist 's impression of what one of these planets may look like the eight new planets have been discovered in the ' @entity2 ' zone of their stars , orbiting at a distance where oceans and life could exist			2
' most of these planets have a good chance of being rocky , like @entity11 , ' said lead scientist dr @entity32 , from the @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35			2
the two most @entity11 - like planets , known as @entity37 - 438b and @entity37 - 442b , both orbit red dwarf stars that are smaller and cooler than the sun. with a diameter just 12 per cent bigger than @entity11 , @entity37 - 438b has a 70 per cent chance of being rocky , the scientists have calculated			1
@entity43 is about one - third larger than @entity11 , and the likelihood of it being rocky is around 60 per cent			1
the two most @entity11 - like planets , known as @entity37 - 438b and @entity37 - 442b , both orbit red dwarf stars that are smaller and cooler than the sun. an artist 's impression is pictured the @entity49 is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet to be in the habitable zone , also known as the ' @entity49 ' , a planet must be not too hot or too cold and receive roughly as much sunlight as @entity11			1
too much heat from its star , and any water would boil away as steam			2
too little , and the water would freeze solid			2

to determine the location of a star 's habitable zone , scientists have to first learn how much total radiation it emits			0
knowing precisely how far away a habitable zone needs to be from a star also depends on chemistry			0
for example , molecules in a planet 's atmosphere will absorb a certain amount of energy from starlight and radiate the rest back out			0
how much of this energy is trapped can mean the difference between a turquoise sea and erupting volcanoes			0
researchers in @entity92 now claim that @entity11 - sized planets could support life at least 10 times further away from stars than first thought			1
' for our calculations we chose to adopt the broadest possible limits that can plausibly lead to suitable conditions for life , ' dr @entity32 added			0
kepler - 438b receives about 40 per cent more light than the @entity11 giving it a 70 per cent probability of having a habitable zone orbit			1
in comparison , baking hot @entity106 has twice as much			0
the other star gets about two - thirds as much light as @entity11 and is 97 per cent likely to be in the habitable zone			1
co-author dr @entity113 , also from the @entity114 , said : ' we do n't know for sure whether any of the planets in our sample are truly habitable			0
all we can say is that they 're promising candidates			0
' neither of the planets are our close neighbours			0
kepler - 438b is located 470 light - years from @entity11 while the more distant kepler - 442b is 1,100 light - years away			1
the team , whose findings were presented at the @entity128 's annual meeting in @entity129 , studied planetary candidates first identified by @entity132 's kepler space telescope			0
all the planets were too small to confirm by measuring their masses			2
instead , they were validated using a computer program that determined they were statistically likely to be planets			0
after the analysis , follow - up observations showed that four of the planets were in multiple star systems			0
the research is also published in the @entity145			0

earlier in its life , this planet may have resembled the newly discovered @entity37 438b			1

this doubles the number of small exoplanets in the ' @entity49 '
this is a *region* in which temperatures allow presence of liquid water
two are among most similar to @entity11 of any known exoplanets to date
known as @entity37 - 438b and @entity37 - 442b , they both orbit red dwarf stars
