by @entity0 they are the programmes that leave viewers enthralled by the wonders of nature			0
but many wildlife scenes in @entity9 series are faked , a veteran cameraman admits			1
in fact , most footage involving small animals is not what it appears , @entity10 said			1
@entity15 's out : experienced cameraman @entity10 let slip the fakery in a speech at the @entity19 species ‘ smaller than a baby rabbit ’ are put in custom - built sets and filmed under controlled conditions , rather than in the wild			1
mr @entity10 ’s revelation comes only two years after sir @entity27 ’s flagship documentary @entity26 was accused of fakery for filming the birth of a polar bear in a zoo rather than in the wild			1
the footage was defended at the time by the veteran naturalist , who compared nature documentaries to ‘ making movies ’			2
but mr @entity10 – once described by sir @entity27 as the best cameraman he had worked with – said he understood why people felt ‘ deceived ’			1
he said : ‘ i think the @entity9 did n’t handle it the best			1
on their website there was a video showing how it was done , but they did n’t quite bring enough attention to it			0
’ mr @entity10 defended the use of captive animals in wildlife films , so long as producers make it clear to audiences which shots are not gathered in the wild			1
proud : mr @entity10 said the @entity9 should have been open about the fact that some scenes for recent @entity27 series @entity26 were filmed in a zoo preparing for the new arrivals : the fake nest being built in a @entity64 zoo , ahead of the birth of the polar bear cubs not as it seems : the ' den ' in the wildlife park was constructed out of plaster and wood , built below the zoo 's polar bear enclosure			1
it was fitted with cameras shortly before the birth ‘ you ca n’t make a film about mice just by going out into a meadow and looking at mice , ’ he said			0
‘ you need to introduce them to a safely built set in which they will be happy			0
there ’s a lot of skill in doing that			0
’ asked whether cameramen were worried about filming wildlife on sets , he said they ‘ have to do and accept it ’ , adding : ‘ nobody seemed to be bothered by it			2
’ mr @entity10 was speaking at the @entity19 , where he is promoting his book @entity97 : a @entity100 ’s @entity99			1
he said the @entity9 should have been proud of the way in which it gathered the @entity26 footage rather than hiding the explanation on its website			1
the sequence showed the new - born polar bears mewling and nuzzling their mother in a cave			0
eight million viewers were led to believe the footage was captured by @entity9 cameramen in harsh sub-zero temperatures			2
however , it emerged it was actually shot in a @entity64 zoo , using fake snow			0
moving scene : the pair of two - day - old polar bear cubs shown on the documentary			0
at this age they weighed less than a kilo , but were filmed in a zoo new build : the polar bear and cub inside the man - made den fashioned out of wood and covered in fake snow faked ? what the viewers saw on @entity26 turned out not to be filmed in the wild , but in a @entity64 zoo it was interspersed with real shots of the @entity138 , while sir @entity27 ’s carefully worded narration led viewers to believe the scene was genuine			2
the veteran broadcaster , 87 , defended the footage at the time , saying : ‘ come on , we were making movies			0
’ but mr @entity10 said the @entity9 should have flagged up its filming techniques at the end of the programme			1
he said : ‘ be proud of it , and then i think people would have felt less deceived			1
i do n’t have a problem with that sort of thing – i did it myself years earlier – but the public , some of the public , chose to think that was fakery			0
’ mr @entity10 was not involved in the polar bear scene and does not film small animals			1
mixed : the scene was mixed with real footage of polar bears in the wild , which may have misled viewers he also addressed the future of nature documentaries , saying there would be no one like sir @entity27 on television again and claiming the presenter ’s involvement in a programme guaranteed 20 per cent more viewers			0
‘ there will never be another @entity27 , ’ he said			0
‘ as long as @entity27 is alive , for anyone else to be called “ the next @entity27 ” is a kiss of death			0
the way television works these days , a presenter is doing well if they last more than ten years			0
‘ on the @entity9 , you ’ll see a lot of new faces that are being tried out			2
some are good , some you see once and then bye bye			0
’ but if anyone is to follow in sir @entity27 ’s footsteps , mr @entity10 said , it will be @entity195 presenter @entity194 because he has ‘ integrity ’ even though he is not ‘ everyone ’s cup of tea ’			2
kept quiet : mr @entity10 said it would be impossible to make programmes about small animals like mice entirely in the wild mr @entity10 also praised professor @entity205 , but said he only ‘ came alive ’ when talking about space and physics rather than wildlife			1
in june , sir @entity27 praised mr @entity10 , who has worked with him on @entity209 , @entity26 and @entity210			2
he said : ‘ capturing animal behaviour in extreme and hostile places takes a very special kind of cameraman and they do n’t come more special than @entity10			1
' i ’ve had the extraordinary good luck of working with him over many years and no one knows the frozen world better than him			0
