a @entity1 documentary which explored the hidden world of dog fighting has received more than 4,000 complaints from viewers who were outraged by bloody scenes of alleged animal cruelty			1
going to the dogs , which aired last night , sought to expose the culture associated with the controversial sport , which animal charities and police warn is on the rise			2
but the programme came under heavy criticism today for glamourising the issue - with the @entity17 now calling for the broadcaster to hand over footage so it can investigate those taking part			1
the channel received 2,000 complaints in less than 24 hours , as well as 600 complaints before the show was aired			1
in addition to this , another 1,000 complaints were sent to the broadcaster via an automatic template on protestors ' websites			1
broadcasting watchdog @entity46 also said it had received more than 1,000 complaints over animal cruelty allegations			1
now the @entity17 is calling for the broadcaster to hand over footage of the show so it can investigate those involved in the murky underworld of the sport			1
in a statement it said : ' overall we believe that ‘ @entity59 ’ was ill - conceived , irresponsible and has done to nothing to help animals , fought or farmed			0
' the @entity17 will continue its work to investigate and uncover illegal dog fighting and we are calling on @entity1 to hand over the footage and reveal the identities of the dog fighters so that we can fully investigate this cruelty			1
' the programme , which was produced by @entity67 , saw filmmaker @entity24 , a former gang member , interview those involved in dog fighting - something which in recent years has been described as a growing problem in the @entity72 's inner - city areas			2
but those who were interviewed had their identities concealed for the cameras , as they spoke openly about their dogs , how they train them for fights and how they deal with injured and dying animals			0
the programme looked into the hidden criminal world associated with dog fighting but was accused of glamourising the controversial sport footage was shown of a savage dog fight , battery farming , the shooting of racehorses and of a game shoot - all of which were slammed by animal rights activists			1
there were also interviews with those involved in pheasant shooting and sports such as horse racing , which avoid the kind of hostility that dog fighting attracts			0
@entity17 criticised the show for comparing these different sports with dog fighting , saying it was a ' disingenuous red herring designed only to court controversy '			2
there was also outrage on @entity106 during and after the show was aired			0
‏ @ @entity107 said : ' i could n't watch " @entity59 " and i 'm angry that @ @entity1 gave air time to an illegal practise , what next ? ' while ‏ @ emmafc74 wrote : ' @entity112			2
abs.disgusting programme , turned off after 10 @entity114			0
' ' we believe that ‘ going to the dogs ’ was ill - conceived , irresponsible and has done to nothing to help animals , fought or farmed ' @entity17 but @entity1 defended its decision to broadcast the show , saying it was ' proud ' to have shed light on an important issue			1
yesterday , the channel refused to budge after an animal rights activist garnered nearly 22,000 supporters in a campaign to have the programme removed from the schedule			0
@entity129 from @entity130 took his campaign not to air the show to @entity133 and soon had thousands supporting him			0
the petition blurb read : ' we as dog lovers do not want to watch such programmes like this they are not showing it to stop dog fighting they are showing it to get ratings ! ' ( sic ) a spokesman for @entity1 said : ' @entity1 are proud of this authored film which sheds light on an underground activity believed to be on the increase			1
' the film raises important issues about animal welfare and blood sports in general and highlights man ’s conflicted relationship with dogs and other animals			2
the audience was made aware of the content in advance of @entity160			0
' the outcome of a dog fight is a source of pride between rival gangs and firearms and drugs are never far away			2
more young men are apparently being attracted and while there are hot spots , including @entity172 , it 's a growing national problem			0
the simple idea is for the two to maul each other until one is dead or incapacitated			0
a spokesman for the production company has not yet responded to a request for a comment .			0
