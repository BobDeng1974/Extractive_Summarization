@entity7 , 15 , gained weight after eating a diet of junk food as a child , and has now lost her confidence after years of being bullied at school			1
despite trying to eat healthily in her teenage years , she claims she simply can not shed the pounds			1

battle : @entity7 , 15 , gained weight after eating a diet of junk food as a child and now weighs 17st			1
she is desperate for a gastric band operation which she claims would allow her to ' live a normal life ' appearing on @entity26 's @entity25 , she said : ' i spent all my childhood and teenage years being fat - and it 's probably going to go on into my twenties			1
' my size is stopping me from living a normal life			0
' people care about your appearance			0
you walk into a room , they look at you and they judge you			0
' they do n't want to get to know you for your personality			2
' @entity7 's story comes after a @entity42 report out today argued obesity should be regarded as a chronic disease with biological causes , that ca n't be cured through diet and exercise			1
previously , experts have argued that weight loss surgery should be offered to more people as it would save the @entity2 money in the long term , at a time when obesity - related costs are spiralling			1
@entity7 said she began gaining weight at seven years old , when she did n't understand concepts like calories and healthy eating			1
she said : ' when i was younger i would eat chips , pizza , fast food stuff			1
@entity66 cheesy chips , i would have them a lot			0
' i was n't going out and burning off the food i ate			2
calorie intake was n't explained to me			2
i was seven , i was a child			2
' now , it 's completely different			0
i have breakfast lunch and dinner - and small portions			0
' now i would have cereal for breakfast , lunch , a soup or sandwich - it depends each day			0
' plight : appearing on @entity26 's @entity25 , she said : ' i spent all my childhood and teenage years being fat - and it 's probably going to go on into my twenties ' @entity7 has since moved in with her grandmother , who encouraged healthy eating , exercise and smaller portion sizes			1
after this change in lifestyle she was losing weight and enjoyed the feeling , so started skipping entire meals to see a quicker result			2
she said : ' i noticed the weight coming off me			0
i started lose more weight when i missed meals			0
' i stopped eating breakfast			0
i stopped eating lunch at school because i did n't like eating in front of people			1
i was worried about what people were saying			0
' @entity7 says she was bullied at school , and told presenters @entity103 and @entity105 she had ' no social life '			1
her grandmother , @entity108 , said the bullying affects the whole family			0
she said : ' it does put a big impact on the family life when @entity7 is being bullied , because obviously @entity7 takes it out on the ones closest to her			2
' so @entity7 could be fine , very happy , then she gets a remark off social media , and the whole house could be flipped upside down because @entity7 is upset , go off to her room , be withdrawn			2
' she finds it hard to talk about what 's being said			0
' after years of embarrassment , gastric band operation would allow her to live normally and enjoy her twenties			1
she said : ' if i get a gastric band , it 's not a quick fix			1
' it 'll be beneficial in the long run , because the weight is coming off you so you can watch what you 're eating			2
' also , soon i 'll start to like the way i look and i 'll feel confident enough so i 'll start feel comfortable going out in public by myself and make friends			0
' @entity7 's story comes after scientists today argued in a new report that exercise and diet are not enough to lose weight when people are obese			1
the mantra ' eat less and move more ' might help obese people shed pounds in the short term , but most put the weight straight back on , they warn			1
doctors need to regard obesity as a chronic disease with largely biological causes that can not be cured through diet and exercise alone , the @entity42 specialists added			2
sharing : despite trying to eat healthily in her teenage years , @entity7 claims she simply ca n't shed the pounds dieting triggers several biological systems that drive us to eat high - calorie foods and gain weight – a hangover from when humans needed to store fat to survive in times of scarcity			1
and according to the four experts , writing in @entity165 and @entity166 journal , these biological reasons are why obese people often fail to maintain long - term weight loss			2
lead author dr @entity169 , from the @entity170 in @entity171 , said lifestyle changes do not appear capable of overriding this fat - loss defence in most patients			0
‘ although lifestyle modifications may result in lasting weight loss in overweight individuals , in those with chronic obesity bodyweight seems to become biologically defended , ’ he said			0
‘ therefore , the current advice to eat less and exercise more may be no more effective for most obese individuals than a recommendation to avoid sharp objects for someone bleeding profusely			1
’ @entity185 , chair of the @entity186 , broadly agreed with the report 's findings			0
losing battle : @entity7 's story comes after scientists today argued in a new report that exercise and diet are not enough to lose weight when people are obese he told this morning : ' he 's been too blunt to say you should n't eat well and exercise			1
' even for those people who have the fat gene , they still need to watch what they 're eating and start exercising			0
' he is correct that you get to such a size that perhaps that 's not the whole story so they need to go off on to something else			0
' he said he agreed @entity7 should be given the gastric band operation on the @entity2 , saying it could be ' the game changer ' for her			1
option : some experts , such as dr @entity212 , say more people should be given @entity2 gastric band surgery because ' it makes economic sense ' he said : ' the operation should be the last resort			1
you should go through the healthy lifestyle steps first			0
but for people like @entity7 , who have been through that , it 's got to be the operation by choice			2
' the @entity226 guidelines are too stringent			0
they demand you should be a certain size , and particularly for children			0
we should be thinking carefully about what we offer children			0
' he added that after having the surgery , @entity7 would have to stick to a diet and exercise plan , and should be offered psychiatric help to guide her through the drastic change in eating habits			1
his comments echo those of other experts , who argue more people should be given gastric band surgery on the @entity2 because ' it makes economic sense '			1
dr @entity212 , presenter of @entity245 's weighing up @entity246 , estimates treating obesity and the associated health problems costs the @entity2 around £ 6 billion every year			0
experts appearing on the programme argued offering gastric band surgery to more patients could save the health service money			1
the cost of the initial bariatric surgery would be recouped by the savings in medications , carers , and the cost of treating obesity - related conditions , they said			2
the @entity262 website reveals gastric band operations cost between £ 5,000 and £ 8,000 at private clinics			1
and gastric bypass surgery costs the @entity2 between £ 9,500 to £ 15,000			2
last year 8,000 overweight patients were given weight loss surgery on the @entity2			2
but that is less than one per cent of those people who could benefit , they said			0
however , they warned bariatric surgery is not without risks			0
complications include internal bleeding , respiratory problems and post-operative infections .			0

@entity7 gained weight after eating a diet of junk food as a child
has no confidence after years of bullying at school and hates going out
despite trying to eat healthily now , she claims she ca n't shed the pounds
new study found diets and exercise are n't enough for some to *succeed*
some medical experts argue gastric band surgery is ' cost effective '
