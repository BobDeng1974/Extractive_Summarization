week - old baby @entity0 sticks her tongue out for the cameras she 's just a week old , but she 's already six feet tall			0
and @entity4 's new giraffe , @entity0 , stepped out in public for the first time today - and even cheekily stuck her tongue out for the cameras			1
@entity0 , which means ' flower ' in @entity10 , is the adorable @entity12 's giraffe who made her debut at the zoo this month			1
she was born to parents @entity16 and @entity18 , on 22 december and is their second baby			2
curator of mammals at @entity4 , @entity22 , said : ' giraffes give birth standing up and the calves fall about 6ft - so they really do come down to @entity26 with a bump			2
' but we 're happy to report that our new , not - so - little , youngster is doing well and is already confident on her long legs			2
' everyone at the zoo is thrilled with @entity0 and she has really added to our @entity34 and @entity35 celebrations			0
' the zoo now has a herd of eight @entity12 's giraffes , which are classed as endangered by the @entity39 ( @entity39 )			1
current population estimates suggest there are less than 1,100 remaining in the wild			0
mr @entity22 added : ' whilst it 's great that we have a nice herd here , in the wild this species really is under threat			0
' numbers are declining at a worrying rate due to a massive upsurge in poaching for their meat			0
' so when people come here and see the likes of @entity0 and see what magnificent animals @entity12 's giraffes are , we really want them to stop and think about the plight of the species in the wild			1
the rare @entity12 's giraffe , who stands at 6ft tall , is already confident on her long legs , said @entity22 , the curator of mammals at @entity4 ' @entity12 's giraffes are of high conservation priority and the need for a concerted conservation effort has never been more urgent			1

its aim is to develop a long - term conservation strategy for the species in @entity78 .			0
