mr @entity6 , who was promoted in last week ’s reshuffle , used the fictional alter ego ‘ @entity10 ’ to write motivational material for the internet marketing company he founded , @entity13			1
but mr @entity10 ’s 2010 tome how to bounce back from recession is unlikely to be on the bedside table of chancellor @entity17 , with its baffling gobbledegook , bizarre tips – and advice on borrowing your way out of recession			1
tips : @entity6 was promoted to @entity7 co-chairman in the cabinet reshuffle last week for instance , those who find themselves unemployed are advised that it is ‘ ree - dic - clu - ous ’ to blame themselves for their predicament			1

‘ @entity44 for goods or services ... be as good to you as you can			0
everyone , even the primary breadwinner , needs some time out from worry and stress			0
learn skills or hobbies [ eg ] playing an instrument , weaving a shawl [ or ] carpentry			0
’ mr @entity10 also offers other suggestions , including taking advantage of low interest rates ‘ to buy a house or vehicle , or just borrow money ... prices are low for package vacations and cruises			0
many recreational vehicles , cycles , snowmobiles and @entity63 [ all - terrain vehicles ] , boats , jet - skis and watercraft , and even airplanes and timeshares are being offered ’			0
mr @entity6 is at pains to point out that he no longer masquerades as mr @entity10 and had no involvement in the recession book			1
he passed his share of the company behind @entity13 to his wife @entity81 in 2008			0
but mr @entity10 lives on as a lingering reminder of mr @entity6 ’ previous career , and continues to generate income for the @entity13			1
yesterday , @entity86 newspaper claimed that @entity87 had blacklisted a series of websites linked to @entity13 for deploying techniques to raise them higher up search rankings – and therefore boost advertising revenue – against the internet giant ’s policies			0
mr @entity6 ’ aides disputed the claims and said that his lawyers were looking at the allegations carefully			1
as recently as 2010 , a rival internet business linked mr @entity6 ' background to mr @entity10			1
alter - ego : a description of ' @entity10 ' appears on a blog offering money - saving tips , accompanied by a picture of an unidentified male @entity107 , a blog offering money - making tips and links , described @entity10 as ‘ a member of the @entity112 ’ who ‘ actually flies his very own personal plane and lives in a fabulous mansion ’			1

we want to help ensure you are smiling and refreshed – not blown to bits and dragging			0
