as @entity2 begin their bid to qualify for @entity4 with a tough trip to @entity6 , @entity1 's @entity0 assesses where the game could be won and lost by @entity10 's side			1
@entity11 vs @entity12 known as the ' @entity14 ' , it 's no wonder much of @entity6 's hopes are pinned on @entity11			1
despite being the star of this team , the 22 - year - old was criticised at the @entity19 and is only used as a super sub at his club @entity21			0
but he will be a threat			0
he 's got legs like a cyclist and they give him explosive pace			2
he 's technically gifted and he likes cutting in off the flanks			0
danger man : @entity11 ( right ) could prove difficult to handle for @entity2 defender @entity12 @entity12 will have to be wary dealing with him			1
if he does cut inside , @entity12 has to pass him on to the midfield markers			2
i 'd like to see @entity12 force @entity11 to go the other way			1
for @entity33 he is one of the best attacking full backs in @entity35 but we 've yet to see that for @entity2			2
he needs to take his club mentality and apply that positivity in a white shirt			0
good going forward : @entity12 needs to show the attacking intent he does at club level in an @entity2 shirt @entity44 vs @entity45 @entity44 played in every game for @entity6 at the @entity19 , so clearly his old coach @entity47 trusted him			1
he ’s a converted midfielder and never really looked like a natural centre half , but he improved dramatically when @entity49 sent him on loan and now he is rebuilding his career in @entity52			0
playing against @entity2 he will certainly have a point to prove , but he can be got at			0
at the back : former @entity49 defender @entity44 ( left ) will be aiming to keep out @entity55 @entity45 ’s move to @entity49 will give him the confidence he needs to become a main striker			1
he can use his pace to run off the back of @entity44 , but he needs to be more ruthless in front of goal			1
on the run : @entity45 ( centre ) has the pace to trouble @entity44 and the rest of @entity6 's defence @entity69 vs @entity70 in terms of experience , this is one of the weakest @entity74 back fours in living memory , so it ’s up to @entity70 to step forward and take charge			1
neither @entity12 nor @entity78 are very experienced internationally and we still do n’t know @entity81 ’s best position			0
leader : @entity70 , pictured tussling with @entity84 's @entity83 , must command @entity2 's back four @entity70 has to lead that unit but it could be a tough night against @entity69			1
the 22 - year - old was largely an impact sub at the @entity19 , but he had quite an impact in their opener against @entity93 when he scored an injury - time winner			0
instant impact : @entity69 ( left ) celebrates after scoring a late winner against @entity93 at the @entity19 talking tactics @entity6 's former boss @entity47 retired after the @entity19			1
with @entity100 now in charge , the @entity99 could move from their solid 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation to a more attacking 4 - 3 - 3			2
that should make them more fluid and give @entity11 greater licence to roam			0
they claim they are underdogs but i do n’t buy that			0
they had a good @entity19 , @entity2 did not and the @entity99 are at home			2
this is our toughest game in the group , and the pressure and expectation are on the hosts			0
fresh start : @entity100 could employ a more attacking formation than @entity99 fans have been used to			2

@entity2 face @entity6 in their first @entity4 qualifier on *monday*
@entity11 could trouble @entity12 with his pace
but @entity12 should use his own attacking *instincts* against the @entity99
@entity45 will be in confident mood after *joining* @entity49
he has the *ability* to get past @entity44 but must be more ruthless
@entity70 needs to show leadership in an *inexperienced* defence
@entity69 will be @entity6 's main striker at @entity137
