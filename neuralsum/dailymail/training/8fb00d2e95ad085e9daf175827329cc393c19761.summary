by @entity0 published : 12:24 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 14:10 est , 13 december 2013 police have recorded their own crime - fighting version of @entity3 in a call for peace over the @entity7 holidays			1
four @entity8 from @entity9 wrote and recorded their own version of the carol in a local studio in their spare time over a melodic piano backing track			1
the song , complete with a video of a burglar being apprehended by @entity19 police , was released on @entity20 exactly 12 days before @entity7			1
it comes as a force in @entity42 , @entity43 , sends @entity7 cards to serial offenders , urging them to be good over the festive period			1
inspector @entity47 , of @entity48 , said : ' i was approached by @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity50 about doing something like this			0
' i set them a challenge to see if they could come up with a crime prevention themed song for @entity7			1
storyline : the @entity8 are seen lecturing a burglar who tried to steal presents and run away mood : at times , the lighting and angles of the camera are positioned to be ominous ' i am stunned by the results and am very proud of their efforts			2
' all of the work was done in their own time and the end result is something which gets a strong crime prevention message across in a fun and quirky , and suitably seasonal way			0
' @entity8 @entity33 , said : ' we always like to use different means of getting a positive crime prevention message out there to raise awareness			2
' we thought using @entity3 would really work - it 's a carol which is familiar but hearing a version with changed lyrics would also make people smile a bit and help us get a point across			2
' sneaking : the man is seen as a shadow			0
the leader of the force said he was happy to invest time in this moral : at the end the burglar is caught and taken into the station			0
they hope the message will spread the card from @entity42 police officers , with two policemen in a tinsel - topped patrol car , warns there will be no festive holiday and police will still come for them if they step out of line			1
deputy chief constable @entity108 said : ' our card will be issued to known criminals who will also get a personal visit from our teams to remind them that we wo n't be taking our eyes off them , even during the festive period			0
' we would like offenders to put these cards on their mantelpiece as a constant reminder that we are on their case and will take any offending very seriously			0
