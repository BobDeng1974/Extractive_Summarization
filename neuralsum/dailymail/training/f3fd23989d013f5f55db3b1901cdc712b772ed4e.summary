@entity2 spent six weeks in custody as police investigated the deaths of several patients from suspected saline drip contamination			1
after being charged with contaminating saline fluids with insulin , ms @entity2 was refused bail for her own protection			1
but the @entity26 dropped the charges because of a lack of sufficient evidence against her			1
the @entity31 has now reported that in a @entity34 writ the nurse has alleged officers asked for her @entity8 password following her arrest so it could be closed down ' to minimise the potentially damaging intrusion into her private life and avoid prejudicing public opinion towards her '			1
but it is alleged an officer reset the password and deactivated then reactivated the account , which meant her previously private page was made available to all internet users			2
ms @entity2 's family and solicitor were also allegedly unable to shut the page down because the password had been changed			2
the nurse has claimed officers gave her name to the media , who obtained messages and pictures from her @entity8 account , while ' highly abusive and distressing ' messages were also posted by members of the public			1
it is also alleged officers obtained confidential information from her @entity68 account after she gave her password so it could be shut down			1
she is now seeking compensation of up to £ 100,000 for aggravated damages for breach of confidence , misuse of private information , negligence and breach of a statutory duty and her legal costs			0
the 29 - year - old says the publicity resulted in her being remanded in custody and has left her unable to find work			0
she alleges she has also had to abandon a business venture which has lost her £ 22,157			0
in february she was suspended for three months by a @entity87 panel after she admitted stealing drugs			0
the panel found her fitness to practice impaired following a disciplinary hearing in which she suggested staff habitually took medication from the premises			0
ms @entity2 sobbed gently as the panel , sitting in @entity94 , said the ' relatively short ' suspension would be the best course of action as she had shown remorse , had done the best to atone for actions and was unlikely to repeat her misconduct			2
colleagues also had confidence in her as a nurse , it noted			0
panel chairman @entity105 said : ' we are satisfied that ms @entity2 has learned a tremendous amount from the experience and we are satisfied she would not repeat her actions			2
' probe : a police investigation into deaths at @entity113 ( above ) led to the arrest of ms @entity2			1
charges against her were subsequently dropped due to lack of sufficient evidence the disciplinary panel found that she was ' not fundamentally dishonest ' and had worked hard to mediate her conduct since the incident			1
ms @entity120 said she had sought no intentional financial benefit and had a ' previously unblemished nursing career '			0
in september 2011 , following her release from jail , ms @entity2 told @entity127 's @entity126 how she was too frightened to walk down the street alone			2
she said she had been portrayed as an ' @entity129 ' following her arrest			0
