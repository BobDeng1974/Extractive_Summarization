if you ’ve ever wanted to have a draught beer machine that works as well as a @entity4 coffee maker , then @entity0 may have the answer			1
the @entity7 group has teamed up with @entity9 industrial designer @entity8 to create a home draft beer gadget named ‘ @entity11 ’			1
the company claims it will allow anyone in the world to experience different types of beer that may otherwise be unavailable in draught form			1
‘ the point is that draft beer is fundamentally for people that like beer and drink beer , and who know that draft beer is far superior to beer that you will get in a can or a bottle			1
’ the 16 - inch ( 41cm ) device looks like a metal beer cask with a tap connected at one end			1
the body sits on a base and it has a red button at the front to switch the device on			0
the sub will allow anyone to experience different types of beer otherwise unavailable in draught form the 16 - inch ( 41cm ) device looks like a metal beer cask with a tap connected at one end ( overhead view on the left )			1
the body sits on a base and it has a red button ( right ) at the front to switch the device on having beer on tap was once a distant dream for many			1
but the rise of the @entity65 – a combination between a keg and a refrigerator – has meant that freshly poured , draught beer is being enjoying in homes across the country			1
the concept was born out of the @entity74 skill sharing community when those desperate for beer on tap found ingenious ways to get it by re-engineering their fridges			2
and it quickly caught on commercially			0
for instance , @entity82 - based @entity81 is now offering its ‘ @entity84 ’ for around $ 600 ( £ 360 )			2
the pressurised system claims to keep beer carbonated for weeks and has a portable unit with rolling casters to move it to any location			0
@entity91 's latest is more portable and cheaper at € 249 ( £ 195 )			0
it can be filled with @entity93 , which are pressurised modules that hold two litres of beer , with different types ordered from the company			1
the @entity93 are placed horizontally into a circular compartment in the middle of the machine			2
one of the biggest advantages of the @entity11 is that it will enable home drinkers to pour themselves the exact amount of their preferred beer			1
" my wife for example , who loves beer , does n't ever drink a whole can of it			0
half a can will sit there , get warm and get thrown out , " mr @entity8 told @entity21			2
" this enables you to have any amount of beer , you could have a thimble full if you wanted and it would be as good as a big glass			0
" the @entity11 costs € 249 ( £ 195 ) and is a development from a similar product launched by @entity0 10 years ago			2
it is currently available in a ‘ @entity126 ’ edition across @entity124 and @entity125			0
it will go on sale in the @entity129 next year , but other markets have yet to announced			0
