actor @entity0 pictured as @entity1 in the @entity3 version of @entity4 viewers appear to have been less than impressed , but for the @entity3 's director general , @entity7 epic @entity4 is the @entity3 ' at its very best '			1
@entity9 , 63 , gave his bold verdict as the drama 's six - episode run came to an end and he added the adaptation of @entity16 's bestselling book was a ' fantastic example ' of ' doing things that people say " only the @entity3 could do that "			1
' when @entity4 debuted last month , it attracted 3.9million viewers , the most successful opening for a @entity24 drama in a decade			1
but , when the final episode hit screens on monday , only 2.3million tuned in , meaning a third of the original audience had given up			1
apart from a slight bump in the middle of the series , the show , which follows the rise of @entity1 in the court of @entity32 , has seen a steady decline in viewers			2
those who did sit through the final instalment – which closed with the execution of @entity32 's second wife @entity41 – joked they could predict the ending , given that it is one of the most famous moments in @entity48 history			0
@entity9 has always taken a keen interest in the multi-million pound project , visiting the set during production			2
despite the disappointing public reaction , has stayed staunchly behind the programme			0
speaking at a special screening of the final episode earlier this week , he said : ' the @entity3 is about one thing and one thing only , it 's about the programmes and the services that give those programmes to the @entity48 public			1
' that 's the case for the @entity3 , it 's as long and short as that			2
in @entity4 we have had a fantastic example of the @entity3 at its very best , doing things that people say , " only the @entity3 could do that "			1
' the director @entity71 , 58 , also lavished praise on his creation but admitted that the £ 7million budget that has been reported was actually ' a great deal more			0
' the final episode saw @entity1 's schemes and manoeuvrings to remove @entity41 as queen come to fruition , with her beheading freeing @entity32 to marry again			1
even though the execution is one of the most famous moments of the tudor period , the lack of suspense did not ruin the drama for many fans			0
one wrote on @entity89 : ' @entity4 , carried by @entity0 's excellent per - formance was very very good			0
even though everyone knew the ending it was still brutal			0
' despite earning the praise of @entity3 director general @entity9 , the show lost 1.6million viewers during its five - week run			1
pictured are @entity98 and @entity99 as @entity41 and @entity32 respectively another joked : ' managed to avoid any spoilers for @entity4 for almost 500 years			0
just need [ to ] see final episode without anyone ruining the ending			1
' @entity4 has been dogged by complaints throughout its run , with the concerns of viewers ranging from it being too dark , too boring and difficult to follow			2
relying only on candles to illuminate some scenes , members of the audience complained at not being able to see what was happening on screen			0
others found themselves unable to stick with the complex intrigues of the @entity7 court			0
one tweeted : ' i got super bored of @entity4 after half an hour and turned it off , and now i 'm re-arranging my sock drawer ' and another added : ' thinking about @entity4 ; know my history , loved the books but still found the chopping and changing of the time line slightly confusing			0

audiences appeared to be *unimpressed* as @entity4 lost 1.6m viewers
when it debuted on *january* *21* , the **tv** show attracted 3.9m viewers
but its final episode which ran five weeks later could only draw in 2.3m
despite this , @entity3 director general @entity9 praised the **tv** adaptation
he said it was a ' fantastic example ' of something ' only the @entity3 could do '
