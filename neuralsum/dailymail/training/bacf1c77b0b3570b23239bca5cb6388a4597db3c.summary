fear factor : panic has spread through a @entity3 village amid rumours that notorious vampire @entity5 is on the loose sales of garlic are booming in western @entity3 today after the local council issued a public health warning that a vampire was on the loose			1
the official announcement came after an old ruined mill said to once have been the home of the country 's most famous vampire collapsed			1
@entity5 was believed to have lived in the shack on the @entity18 river in @entity20 village in the municipality of @entity22			1
it is said he drank the blood of anybody that came to mill their grain			1
the watermill was bought by the local @entity30 family and they were too scared to use it as a mill – but discovered it was a goldmine when they started advertising for tourists to come and visit it – always during the day			1
the family were worried about carrying out building work on the mill because they were scared they might disturb the vampire or unleash his wrath			2
and now the property has collapsed through lack of repair			2
but for locals it has sparked rumours that the vampire is now free once again			0
local mayor @entity52 admitted : ' people are worried , everybody knows the legend of this vampire and the thought that he is now homeless and looking for somewhere else and possibly other victims is terrifying people			1
' he added that it was all very well for people who did n't live in the area to laugh at their fears but he said nobody in the region was in any doubt that vampires do exist			2
he confirmed that the local council had advised all villagers to put garlic on their doors and windows to protect them from the vampire as it was well known they ca n't stand the smell			2
' people are terrified ' : @entity5 is said to be on the prowl after his home ( above ) , a favourite with tourists , collapsed in the village of @entity20 frightening folklore : @entity5 was believed to have lived in the shack ( pictured ) on the @entity18 river in the village of @entity20 , where it is said he drank the blood of anybody that came to mill their grain the notion of blood - sucking vampires preying on the flesh of the living goes back thousands of years and was common in many ancient cultures , where tales of these reviled creatures of the dead abounded			1
archaeologists recently found 3,000 @entity104 graves , for example , where bodies had been weighed down with rocks to prevent the dead emerging from their tombs			0
the advent of @entity111 only fuelled the vampire legends , for they were considered the antithesis of @entity114 — spirits that rose from the dead bodies of evil people			2
but the term ' vampire ' was not popularised until the early 18th century after an influx of vampire superstition from areas such as the @entity123 and @entity124			0
belief in such legends became so pervasive it caused mass hysteria in some areas and even public executions of people believed to be vampires			0
@entity133 's 1897 novel @entity134 , above , is considered the seminal vampire novel which provided the basis of modern vampire fiction			0
he added : ' we have also reminded them to put a @entity140 in every room in the house			1
' villagers who cashed in catering to tourists fascinated by the legend of @entity5 say they now wish they had left the place well alone			1
@entity5 features in the 1880 story @entity151 ( after ninety years ) , written by the @entity3 realist writer @entity152 who inspired the 1973 horror film @entity154 he also appears in the novel @entity155 ( @entity156 and his servant ) written by @entity158			1
other famous vampire cases in @entity3 include those of @entity161 and @entity162			1
@entity161 , a peasant , was said to have died at the age of 62 in 1785 , but reportedly returned from the grave to ask his son for food			0
when his son refused , @entity161 brutally murdered him			0
later , the villagers decided to exhume the son 's body to look for signs of vampirism and were shocked to apparently find a fresh corpse with ' new skin and nails '			0
they said blood could be seen at the mouth			0
they proceeded to stake the body through the heart causing ' completely fresh ' blood to flow through the ears and mouth of the corpse			0
finally , the body was burned			0
in the other case , it was said @entity162 , a soldier - turned - farmer , was attacked by a vampire and went on to kill a dozen people in the surrounding area in the early 18th century			0
both cases became famous because the @entity191 authorities , who at that time controlled @entity3 , appeared to confirm that vampires did indeed exist			1
on alert : the mayor of @entity197 advised all villagers to put garlic on their doors and windows to protect them from the vampire as it was well known they ca n't stand the smell			2

@entity5 ' on prowl ' after his watermill home in @entity3 collapsed
