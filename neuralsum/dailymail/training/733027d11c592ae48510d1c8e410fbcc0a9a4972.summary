thrifty star reveals she loves the @entity3 chemist 's no. 7 face cream by @entity4 published : 08:41 est , 30 march 2012 updated : 17:11 est , 30 march 2012 when asking @entity7 celebrities what they love about @entity9 you 'd think they 'd say the history , the buildings - or most likely , accent			1
so this latest revelation from @entity14 may come as quite a shock			1
despite having a bank balance healthier than most , the 39 - year old actress has revealed her love of @entity19			1
in a recent interview the mother - of - two said : ' one of the many exciting things about living in @entity9 for a good part of the year is the perpetual discovery			2
' boots is almost as ubiquitous as the pub here in @entity9			2
everyone raves about @entity30 and their range of high quality cosmetics , moisturisers and cleansers			2
' bargain beauty : since moving to the @entity37 @entity14 has become a fan of the @entity40 range at boots the high street chain became popular with brits following the discovery by scientists from @entity48 's @entity47 programme that the @entity50 and @entity51 cream was a ' miracle product '			1
shoppers queued for hours to test it out and stores had to ration purchases after many sold out in minutes			2
but @entity14 is n't the only a-lister to admit to being a fan of the popular chemist			1
@entity63 of @entity64 , 30 , is often spotted at her local branch buying @entity66 and @entity67 , which costs just £ 5.10			2
@entity68 : @entity69 is often spotted shopping in her local boots for @entity66 moisturiser and with so many skincare products costing upwards of £ 100 , it 's refreshing to see that celebrities appreciate bargain buys too			1
@entity78 , 43 , may be one of the world 's most beautiful - and wealthiest - women but she swears by a £ 1.99 bar of soap			1
in an interview she revealed : ' i 've been using it since @entity86			0
' i wake up and wash my face with @entity89 face soap			1
i use a serum and then a dr @entity92 day cream - that ’s it ! ' lather up : @entity78 swears by @entity89 soap : ' i 've been using it since @entity86 ' even @entity96 model @entity95 does n't break the bank with an expensive beauty routine			1
the 28 - year old @entity100 model says her blemish - free skin and glossy hair is down to a £ 8.25 pot of coconut oil			0
‘ i will not go a day without coconut oil			0
i personally take four tablespoons per day , either on my salads , in my cooking or in my cups of green tea , ' the model explained			0
the @entity96 's out : model @entity95 says that blemish - free skin is thanks to her addiction to coconut oil but for @entity119 nominee @entity118 , 23 , her sensitive skin may limit the choice but a £ 3.49 bottle of grapeseed oil works wonders			1
speaking earlier this year the actress revealed : ' i 'm seriously allergic to everything			0
so i just use natural grapeseed oil from the grocery store on my face as a moisturiser			1
after the shower , i pat it on , and then i 'll use it throughout the day and night			0
' feeling fruity : actress @entity118 says she uses so much @entity133 she constantly smells of it for some stars though creativity can be just as worthwhile as splashing the cash			0
and in a shock twist the celebrity who swears by this technique is @entity141			0
the @entity142 turned designer has reportedly been experimenting with making her own facemasks with her latest creation being her best yet			0
a friend of the 37 - year old told @entity149 magazine that blending apricot and avocado is her ' latest thing '			0
the concoction is supposed to have anti-ageing properties when applied to the skin and has even been described as the ' million - dollar facial '			0
@entity157 : friends have revealed that @entity141 has invented her own facemask by mixing avocado with apricot			0
