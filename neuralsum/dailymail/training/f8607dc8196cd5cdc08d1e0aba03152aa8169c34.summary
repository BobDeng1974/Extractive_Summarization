a bright flash of light and booming noises in a cramped seat thousands of feet in the air would be enough to put off even the most hardened fliers			0
but passengers landing at @entity6 on friday afternoon were led by example as their captain coolly steered them through three lightning blasts and left it until afterwards to calmly explain what happened			1
passengers spoke of a ' massive bang ' as one of the bolts struck the body of the @entity18 service from @entity19 , but the blasts had no effect on the landing , which proceeded as normal to touch down at 4.30pm			1
' @entity42 , 51 , was one of 174 passengers on board the flight , from which ominous ' dark skies ' could be seen just before the first bolt struck			1
the businessman , who was returning from a conference , said : ' it was incredible - there was one massive bang			1
only moments before , i ’d noticed the dark skies and told a passenger sitting next to me that i was surprised there was no thunder and lightning			1
' after the bang , my initial thought was the engine had blown - up			2
surprisingly , it was n’t frightening , it was exciting			0
' you are waiting for something else to happen , then you realise nothing has gone wrong			0
' coming in to land : the flight touched down without any problems at @entity6 on friday the picture of the plane , caught up in the centre of several branches of a lightning bolt , was taken by @entity75 , 42 , who was watching the storm			1
she said : ' i did n’t even see the plane at first , i was just clicking on my phone and then afterwards i saw the aircraft			2
' i think it is a once in a lifetime picture , i doubt i will see anything like that again , i am not a photographer , it was just a stroke of luck i got the shot			0
' a statement from @entity18 said : ' occasionally aircraft is hit multiple times by lightning			1
all pilots and air crew are trained to deal with this			0
' a spokesman for @entity6 said : ' all aircraft landed safely without incident on friday afternoon			1
' although it may sound a terrifying prospect , commercial aircraft around the world are bombarded with bolts of lightning every single day			2
according to experts , the in an average year any given airliner can expect to be struck at least once on its travels			0
indeed , as the fuselage of most planes is made of conductive aluminium , their presence in storm clouds , where huge amounts of static electricity gather , can actually trigger the discharges			0
but due to strict regulations , all passenger planes must be built with electrical shielding which protects the inside of the plane from the effects of lightning bolts			2
those on board often fail to notice that the plane has been hit at all , or experience nothing more than a quick flash			0
it is estimated that aircraft shielding is strong enough to withstand voltages ten times the amount of a typical bolt , and no planes have been brought down by lightning since 1967			1
the worst which can usually be expected from a lightning blast is a visible scorch mark			0
occasionally flights which are struck early in their journey are diverted as a safety precaution .			0
