cracked : @entity1 's video shows how he smuggled a metal case through scanners at two airports controversial nude body scanners used at @entity7 airports have come under fire again - after a blogger claimed he could easily smuggle explosives through them onto a plane			1
engineer @entity1 has published a video where he shows how he took a small metal case through two of the @entity17 's $ 1billion fleet in a special side pocket stitched into his shirt			1
this is because , he suggests , the scanners blend metallic areas into the dark background - so if an object is not directly placed on the body , it will not show up on the scan			1
the metallic box , he claims , would have set off an alarm had he passed through the old detecting system			1
his revelation comes just weeks after @entity32 banned the ' airport strip - searches ' over fears the x-ray technology could cause cancer			1
@entity37 has decided not to publish the video because it details exactly how to circumvent the safety procedure - but it is freely available to watch online			1
@entity1 , standing in his living room as he speaks to the camera in the video for his ' @entity17 out of our pants ' blog , acknowledges the technique could be used by terrorists			1
but he believes they would already know about the loophole , and took the steps to show ' how much danger the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) is putting all us all in '			2
@entity53 : in this @entity17 scan the metal items , located on the traveller 's body , can clearly be seen as the body appears against a black background contrast : in this image , the metallic object is not directly placed on the body and so does not show up on the scan as it blends into the background @entity32 banned the controversial airport ' strip - search ' scanners last year over fears the x-ray technology could cause cancer			1
they emit low radiation doses and the @entity73 told members in november not to install them until the potential risks are assessed			0
the @entity17 , in contrast , has continually defended their safety , saying they expose passengers to the same radiation as two minutes on a flying plane			1
@entity82 's @entity81 , which has 16 of the $ 125,000 ' backscatter ' machines , was told it can continue using them for another year			0
but no new machines will be allowed there			0
they were once used at @entity89 but scrapped amid complaints over privacy invasion			0
they have also been tested in @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 but will be completely banned in april if experts rule they are dangerous			2
the body scanners were introduced in a security crackdown after incidents such as the attempted ' underwear bomb ' plot in 2009			2
around 250 x-ray scanners and 264 - millimetre - wave scanners are currently used in @entity7 ’s airports			1
@entity1 , who is suing the @entity17 for rolling out the scanners , explained how the loophole worked			1
he said : ' here are several images produced by @entity17 nude body scanners			2
you 'll see that the search victim is drawn with light colours and placed on a black background in both images			2
' in these samples , the individuals are concealing metallic objects that you can see as a black shape on their light figure			0
again that ’s light figure , black background , and black threat items			0
' yes that ’s right , if you have a metallic object on your side , it will be the same colour as the background and therefore completely invisible to both visual and automated inspection			0
' it ca n’t possibly be that easy to beat the @entity17 ’s billion dollar fleet of nude body scanners , right ? the @entity17 ca n’t be that stupid , can they ? unfortunately , they can , and they are			2
' he said he put his theory to the test by buying a sewing kit to sew a pocket directly onto the side of his shirt			0
he then took a metallic case and walked through a backscatter x-ray at @entity144 - all of which he recorded on film			2
he said : ' while i ’m not about to win any videography awards for my hidden camera footage , you can watch as i walk through the security line with the metal object in my new side pocket			0
' my camera gets placed on the conveyor belt and goes through its own x-ray , and when it comes out , i ’m through , and the object never left my pocket			0
' maybe a fluke ? ok , let ’s try again at @entity163 through one of the @entity17 ’s newest machines : a millimetre wave scanner with automated threat detection built - in			2
' with the metallic object in my side pocket , i enter the security line , my device goes through its own x-ray , i pass through , and exit with the object without any complaints from the @entity17			0
' he added : ' while i carried the metal case empty , it could easily have been filled with razor blades , explosives , or one of @entity180 ’s infamous seven gram rocks of cocaine			1
' with a bigger pocket , perhaps sewn on the inside of the shirt , even a firearm could get through			0
' controversial : a demonstration of the scanners that @entity32 bosses have failed to give the green light for			1
a full body scan is shown , left , and a screen showing the results of the scan , right @entity7 use : more than 600 @entity196 units , using x-ray technology , have been installed at 140 airports across the @entity7 while @entity1 's actions have not been independently verified , and the @entity17 have not commented on the video , he said it proved the organisation 's ' disregard for safety '			1
he added : ' now , i ’m sure the @entity17 will accuse me of aiding the terrorists by releasing this video , but it ’s beyond belief that the terrorists have n’t already figured this out and are already plotting to use this against us			0
' it ’s also beyond belief that the @entity17 did not already know everything i just told you , and arrogantly decided to disregard our safety			0
the nude body scanner program is nothing but a giant fraud			0
