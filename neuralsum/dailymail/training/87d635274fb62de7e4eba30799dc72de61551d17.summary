by @entity0 picture the scene : your nation has made it to the @entity5 and the game has gone to a penalty shootout			0
in dramatic fashion your opponents miss a spot - kick giving your captain the chance to win the tournament , but what are the odds on him scoring ? as it turns out , exceedingly high			1
not only does he have an area bigger than a cargo container to aim for , but the slow reaction times of any given person compared to a kicked ball in tandem with psychological preparation should - should - seen him put the ball away with ease			1
at least , that ’s the theory			0
researchers at @entity29 in @entity30 have found that the most skilled goalkeepers can guess the right way in a penalty 70 per cent of the time , but other factors mean they 'll only save it a quarter of the time such as @entity39 's successful penalty against @entity40 on 14 june ( shown ) so far in the 2014 @entity43 world cup six penalties have been given - and all six have been scored			1
research from @entity46 has revealed how fans plan to watch the matches			0
presenters on live pause - @entity50 is the football presenter fans most want to ‘ live pause ’ - more than a quarter ( 26 per cent ) admit they will skip past his commentary			1
solo spectators - 23 per cent of football fans plan to watch the majority of games at home alone			2
out of office - more than a quarter ( 27 per cent ) of fans have booked time off work to watch the football over the next month			1
off schedule sport - nearly half of fans ( 44 per cent ) are planning to record matches and watch them at a time that suits them better than the scheduled broadcast			1
smart viewing - almost a third of people ( 30 per cent ) are planning on watching the action unfold on a smartphone , tablet or smart tv			0
and in the season just gone , in the @entity79			0
only 14 of 87 penalties were missed or saved			0
but what makes penalties so hard to stop ? the answer lies in the deceivingly large size of a goal , the short amount of time available to a keeper to react , and psychological mind games			1
' if the player hits the ball hard enough the goalkeeper has very little chance of saving it , ' professor of sport and learning at the @entity92 @entity91 told @entity98			2
' penalty taking is all about managing stress ; players need to have overlearned the skill and practiced in stressful conditions ; they need make their mind up and stick to that decision			1
' but there is good news for goalkeepers - those that are exceptionally gifted have a significant edge over their colleagues			2
in research commissioned by @entity113 for @entity29 in @entity30 they found that @entity115 footballers can anticipate the actions of an opponent up to 80 milliseconds before they move			1
that means that as @entity122 ’s @entity121 stares down @entity124 ’s @entity123 , his brain will automatically notice minute details in the striker ’s run up that gives him an indication as to which way he ’s going to shoot			0
some goalkeepers come off their line when a penalty is being taken ( @entity136 keeper @entity135 is seen making a save here ) to reduce the area a player has to score , at the expense of having less reaction time			1
doing so , however , is not technically legal and if a keeper comes too far of his line the penalty will be retaken in fact , the researchers working with the @entity146 found skilled players could anticipate the actions of their opponent 70 per cent of the time , compared to just 52 per cent for less skilled players			1
‘ the smallest margins can make the difference between winning and losing , ’ said @entity154 professor @entity153 , who was behind the @entity156 research			2
‘ as a result of extensive training and experience on the pitch , the top players have developed high - refined perceptual and cognitive skills that enable them to anticipate exactly what an opponent will do ahead of the act itself			1
’ skilled goalkeepers apparently spend more time studying the face of the penalty taker and can fixate on the motion of a kicker ’s legs moments before he touches the ball			1
for a keeper such as @entity121 , according to @entity153 , his ‘ visual system is finely attuned to picking up information from the bodily movements of an opponent as well as the penalty taker ’s preferred tendencies for kick placement			2
’ and he added : ‘ this research shows that those players who practice their art and train hardest have the best chance of success			2
’ some players stutter their run - up to make the keeper commit to a direction first before kicking the other way			1
@entity196 attempted this in the opening came of @entity199 2014 for @entity43 but , although @entity201 goalkeeper @entity200 went the right way , he did n't have time to get enough behind the ball to save it that research is backed up a study by @entity208 ’s sports science on penalty kicks for the @entity210 in @entity211			1
they found that goalkeepers were able to guess the direction of the ball correctly 57 per cent of the time			1
but this is where the good news stops for goal keepers ; because of the time it takes to move , only 22 per cent of those shots were saved			1
the reason for this is that no amount of psychological preparation can help if a penalty taker knows what he ’s doing			0
on average a ball kicked in a penalty travels at about 70 mph ( 112km/h ) , according to @entity233			1
with the penalty spot 36ft ( 11 metres ) from the goal , this means it will take the ball less than half a second to reach the net			1
that gives the goalkeeper around 700 milliseconds to look which way the ball is going , decide which way to jump and move his body in that direction			0
the penalty spot is 36 feet ( 11 metres ) from the goal			2
the average speed of a penalty kick is 70 miles ( 112 kilometres ) per hour , which gives the goalkeeper about 700 milliseconds to save it			2
however it takes most almost a second to do so - meaning they have to move earlier in reality it takes the goalkeeper up to a second to watch the ball and then jump in its direction – by which the ball will already be nestled in the net , providing the player shot to the side			2
instead , what most goalkeepers do is begin their jump and movement before the kick is taken			0
this leads to some players , such as @entity43 ’s @entity196 in their recent game against @entity201 , to stutter their run - up and entice the keeper to move before they ’ve kicked the ball , allowing them to shoot the other way			1
the short amount of time available for a keeper to react and then begin his jump means the players have a huge advantage			2
but it ’s not just human biology that hampers goalkeepers – it ’s the size of the goal , too			0
a football goal is 24 ft ( 7.3 metres ) wide and eight feet ( 2.4 metres ) tall , giving it an area of 192 square feet ( 17.9 square metres )			1
covering this entire area , bigger than a cargo container , is not easy			0
this , combined with the short amount of time available , shows just how difficult it is for goalkeepers to save a penalty			2
another factor working against goalkeepers is the sheer size of the goal			0
football goals have a total area of 192 square feet ( 17.9 square metres ) into which a player can shoot and , with the ball starting just 36ft ( 11 metres ) away , it gives the goalkeeper little time to make a save ( stock image shown ) and that ’s not all ; a study by the @entity310 ( @entity310 ) found that ‘ game theory ’ played an important part in deciding the outcome of a penalty kick			1
for those unfamiliar with game theory it ’s the suggestion that opponents in any scenario , from war to chess , will follow predictable strategies to try and outwit each other			0
according to associate professor in @entity310 ’s @entity326 @entity325 the world ’s top players such as @entity329 , @entity330 and @entity331 are not just world - class athletes , but also skilled and rational decision - makers as well			1
kickers and goalies have to make decisions simultaneously because things happen so fast			0
they have to decide to go right or left or in the middle			0
on top of that , ' kickers are usually better at kicking to one side than the other , ' according to the researchers			0
' you would think that the kicker would always kick to his stronger side , but if he did the goalie would always jump to that side and the kicker would be worse off			0
' so a kicker , like someone who bluffs in poker , sometimes has to pick the lesser option and kick to his weak side to make goalies uncertain of what he ’s going to do			0
' what researchers found when they looked at this publicly available data was that kickers and goalies usually pick their equilibrium strategies			0
' @entity366 kick to their weak side just often enough so that the goalie does n’t always want to jump the same way			0
likewise , goalies picked an equilibrium strategy for blocking shots			0
' all of this combined shows how much of an art form saving or scoring a penalty really is			0
perhaps teams can have a new excuse if they come to failing in penalty shoot - out again - it ’s simply science and maths working against the team .			0

@entity30 's @entity29 found that skilled players can read opponents
but research suggests other factors makes penalties very hard to save
the best keepers can read where a penalty will be kicked over half the time
but they will only be able to save the ball in less than a quarter of kicks
this is *due* to the large size of a football goal - 192 square feet
reaction times of humans are not enough to cover the entire goal
so keepers must make a decision before the ball is kicked - giving the striker an *invaluable* edge over their opponent
so far , six out of six penalties at the @entity43 @entity199 have been scored
