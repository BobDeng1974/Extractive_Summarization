by @entity1 reporter published : 22:16 est , 27 february 2014 @entity3 : 06:11 est , 28 february 2014 a 62 - year - old @entity6 man 's february 16 death is being blamed on a brown recluse spider bite , a fatality so rare that statistics are n't even kept for them			1
@entity11 was bitten in the neck by the spider , which are usually about the size of a @entity16 quarter , all the way back in august while clearing out an old house			1
what followed were six agonizing months of related illnesses as the @entity22 man clung to life with an abscess eating away toward his spine until he finally let go last week			1
days after that , a paralyzed @entity11 collapsed			2
the @entity47 deemed his death the result of complications from a spider bite , but between his collapse and his eventual death , @entity11 suffered terribly			1
@entity11 's 88 - year - old father @entity54 said his son went through numerous procedures and was in and out of the hospital , but nothing seemed to work			1
' they tried to alleviate his pain , but for six months they did n't , ' @entity11 said			2
' we would beg the nurses to give him something			0
' finally after months of suffering , @entity11 's pain stopped			2
' i was glad when he died			0
i said , " thank you , @entity67 , for getting him out of his misery ? " ' said @entity11			2
rare : a @entity6 man bitten by a brown recluse and died six agonizing months later from complications from the bite , making him an extremely rare example of a spider bite fatality abscess : a brown recluse bite can cause an abscess such as this			1
sometimes these wounds become extremely large and can become seriously infected , as was likely the case with @entity11 ( file ) a brown recluse bite may start as a blister that eventually becomes an abscess after necrosis sets in			1
other symptoms may include : @entity90 recluse spiders are typically found in cool , dark , damp places			0
the midwest and southern states more commonly see large numbers of the arachnid , but they are present in parts of @entity6			2
the @entity16 sees no more than 1 or 2 spider bite deaths a year , if that			1
however , most such fatalities are caused by the brown recluse			1
@entity11 's death is startling not just for all its needless suffering but also for its astounding rarity			2
' the medical examiner said @entity11 was never tested to determine what type of spider bit him , but medical records show there were definite complications from a spider bite wound on his neck			1
few statistics on deaths attributed to spider bites are available			0
according to the @entity115 , only two people died from spider bites between 2001 and 2005			0
both were believed to be caused by brown recluse spiders			1
the brown recluse spider , which is not native to @entity6 , is one of just a handful of spiders that are dangerous to humans , though all spiders carry venom as a way to kill and digest their prey , said @entity128 biology professor @entity127			1
according to the @entity129 , a bite from a brown recluse spider starts with two small puncture wounds and develops into a blister			1
the venom can also cause a severe lesion by destroying skin tissue , which requires medical attention			0
however , the bites typically are n't lethal , @entity127 said			0
‘ in most spider bites , complications arise mostly if there 's some secondary factor			0
if the person has a specific allergic reaction , if their health was compromised in some other manner , or if the bite causes an open wound with a secondary infection , ’ @entity127 said			0
spiders typically avoid humans , he said			0
‘ most spiders are n't going to attack you , ’ @entity127 said			0
‘ it 's when you trap them , or you 're moving something out of a cabinet and your hand brushes them — it 's typically a defense			0
they react rather than attack			0
’ scary : the brown recluse is not native to @entity6 but it 's commonly found in the @entity6 nonetheless			1
the yellow area indicates the potentially dangerous arachnid 's normal stomping grounds			0
in parts of the @entity168 and @entity169 , the brown recluse can be found in large groups inside homes			2

@entity11 , 62 , of @entity22 , @entity6 died february 16 from complications from a brown recluse spider bite
