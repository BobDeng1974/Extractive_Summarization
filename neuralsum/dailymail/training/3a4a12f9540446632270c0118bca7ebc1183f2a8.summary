in @entity2 ’s cramped and drafty media room with zero space for manoeuvre amid the television cameras , laptops , reporters and tea ladies , @entity0 still managed to unearth a new excuse for @entity11 ’s shortcomings			1
we ’ve had his players , the fans , the club hierarchy and referees – now it ’s the turn of the @entity18			1
' the problem is you , not me , ’ he said , nodding towards a small gathering of @entity25 journalists , myself included			2
@entity0 cuts a frustrated figure on the touchline during @entity11 's defeat to @entity29 in the @entity30 @entity0 later blamed the club 's problems on the @entity18 as @entity11 lurch from one defeat to the next ' if we close @entity11 - if we put a @entity37 @entity36 around the city - it would be fantastic			1
' now , when we let you in and you get out and say what you want , we 've got a problem			0
i invite every @entity11 fan and people around the club not to listen to any one of you - only to me			1
' @entity0 , then , wants to create a closed state where supporters are only exposed to his words and no outside interpretation of them			1
too often , however , he talks in riddles - it needs a third party to decode his message			0
but following the 2 - 0 humiliation at @entity29 his target was clear , and it was n't the players who had just under - performed so badly against @entity58 opposition			1
@entity0 ’s mood lurches between happy , sad , relief and frustration – often all within the confines of one interview			2
he is , at his best , and normally during a pre-match media gathering , engaging , funny , honest and vibrant			0
earlier this month he sat for 20 minutes and told us all about his famous father , @entity67 , who captained the national basketball team at the @entity69			0
he enjoyed it , and so did we			0
@entity71 finds the back of the net as @entity29 cause another shock to reach the @entity30 quarter - finals @entity29 celebrate their @entity30 victory and their place in the last eight of the famous old competition @entity80 ( left ) trudges off dejected after scoring an own goal in the third minute fast forward to the aftermath of last week ’s defeat to @entity84 and he ’s at the other end of the court , on the defensive and accusing his players of pandering to the want of supporters – ‘ crazy football ’ he called it			1
just a fortnight earlier , following the most arduous goalless draw with @entity94 , @entity0 said the club ’s fans were ‘ living in the past ’ and pining for @entity97 and @entity98			2
it did n’t go down well			0
previously he has spoken of his players not being able to implement the style of play he wants , while sporting director @entity102 , pre january , was the subject of pressure to deliver the personnel he needed to avoid a repeat of last season ’s relegation fight			0
‘ i am only the head coach , i only pick the team , ’ a favourite soundbite of @entity0 ’s			2
but always , given a few days to reflect , he attempts to play down the subsequent headlines and offers reason for his post-game outbursts			0
so why now does he turn on the @entity18 ? he was asked that as he squeezed out of the media room on sunday , the ‘ @entity36 ’ analogy his final utterance			1
@entity0 previously claimed @entity11 fans were pining for the days of strikers @entity97 and @entity98 reporters who do not work the @entity25 patch were stunned by his attack			1
this , however , has been bubbling under the surface for a while and it was inevitable the @entity18 would eventually incur his wrath given that all other factions had previously been targeted			2
he is in danger of alienating himself and club bosses will be concerned at the situation which is unfolding			0
during the second half at @entity29 , supporters sang ‘ @entity0 , it ’s always our fault ’ before a scuffle broke out in the away end – it demonstrated more fighting spirit than the players had shown on the pitch and they were duly booed at the end of the game			1
it has left a huge disconnect between all parties – @entity0 , players , supporters and @entity18			1
results , of course , can change everything			0
but @entity11 have won just four times in the @entity153 this season and currently reside just two points above the relegation zone			1
it has been a sorry season , low on energy and entertainment			0
the significance of saturday ’s visit of @entity161 can not be underplayed , both in terms of points on the board and mood on the terraces			0
before then , it promises to be interesting when @entity0 meets with the press on thursday			2
once we have scaled the wall that is …			0

@entity11 crashed out of the @entity30 to @entity29 on sunday
manager @entity0 later claimed the @entity18 were the problem
he *suggested* putting a ' @entity36 ' around the city
@entity11 currently lie two points outside the @entity153 drop zone
