by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 10:53 est , 16 february 2013 updated : 14:01 est , 16 february 2013 the inner workings of a secretive and now - disgraced @entity5 order called the @entity6 were revealed by documents released on friday			1
they include details on how the founder of the organization , the reverend @entity10 who died in 2008 , lived a double life , fathering three children , and was accused of abusing seminarians			1
the @entity6 kept this information hidden			2
also revealed are allegations that the organization solicited money from an elderly widow , eventually persuading her to bequeath it $ 60 million			1
the scandal , which has tarnished the legacy of @entity23 , is cited as an especially egregious example of how the @entity25 ignored decades of reports about sexually abusive priests because church leaders put the interests of the institution above those of the victims			1
he is seen here with pope @entity23 ( right ) in 2004 these documents , released in @entity42 , are the first - ever depositions of high - ranking @entity6 officials and include how the order 's former second - in - command learned in 2006 that its founder had fathered a child			1
the no. 2 said he did n't go public with the news of the paternity because @entity10 , had already been sanctioned by the @entity25 for having sexually abused seminarians and forced into a lifetime of penance and prayer			1
pope @entity57 took over the @entity6 in 2010 after a @entity25 investigation into @entity10 determined that the @entity10 had fathered three children by two women			1
the pope ordered a wholesale reform of the order and named a papal delegate to oversee it			0
in other documents released friday , the rev. @entity67 , the former no. 2 of the @entity6 , details for the first time how he confronted @entity10 's mistress and daughter , starting in october 2006 , after he became suspicious while visiting @entity10 in a @entity75 , @entity74 , hotel that june and seeing the two women there			1
in 2010 @entity76 alleged that @entity10 sexually abused one of his two sons with her as well as a son she had from a previous relationship @entity82 @entity81 ( left ) and @entity83 ( right ) both claim they were abused by @entity10 - their father both women confirmed @entity10 's paternity , and @entity67 said he obtained the daughter 's birth certificate as proof - listing the father as @entity91			1
later , it was revealed that @entity10 used the same pseudonym with his other hidden family , a @entity95 woman with whom he had two sons			2
in 2010 @entity76 alleged that @entity10 sexually abused one of his two sons with her as well as a son she had from a previous relationship			1
the sons , now adults named @entity102 and @entity83 , said the abuse went on for years			0
@entity76 said she met @entity10 in @entity104 in the 1970s but did not know he was a priest			2
she said he passed himself off as an employee of an international oil company , a private investigator and a @entity109 agent			0
@entity67 said he never confronted @entity110 about his double life and did n't think it was necessary to share the news with the broader membership of the @entity6 or its lay movement @entity116			2
he said he only told the @entity6 's superior and two other priests			1
' i did n't think at the time that the fact that fathering a child would change in any way the way we needed to behave vis - a - vis @entity110 or the actions that we needed to do , ' @entity67 said in the 2011 deposition			0
reverend @entity10 , who died in 2008 , fathered three secret children with two separate women and was accused of abusing seminarians ' because we needed to comply with indications of the @entity25 and also because there was an issue of privacy and respect for the mother and the daughter			1
' the legion did n't acknowledge @entity10 's children or the sexual abuse allegations against him until february 2009 , about a year after he died			1
the papers also describe how the organization solicited money from an elderly widow , eventually persuading her to bequeath it $ 60 million			1
the documents , previously sealed in a lawsuit brought before @entity147 in @entity42 , include thousands of pages of testimony from high - ranking leaders at the @entity6 , its members and relatives of wealthy widow @entity153			2
a @entity155 judge said last year that the documents raised a red flag because @entity153 , a steadfastly spiritual elderly woman , transferred millions to ' clandestinely dubious religious leaders			0
' but they had been kept under seal until @entity2 , the @entity161 , the @entity162 and the @entity163 intervened , arguing that they were in the public interest			0
the @entity6 is also accused of soliciting $ 60 million from an elderly widow , @entity167			1
the woman 's niece alleges her aunt was defrauded by the legion and unduly influenced by its priests into giving away her fortune the @entity6 had argued media coverage of the documents could taint prospective jurors if there was a trial			2
@entity180 had alleged that her aunt , @entity153 , who died at age 96 in 2008 , was defrauded by the @entity6 and unduly influenced by its priests into giving away her fortune			2
her late husband was a onetime director of @entity184			0
the @entity6 said that it did n't exert undue influence over her decision - making and that the gifts were made of her own will			2
' our actions with regard to mrs. @entity153 and her estate were appropriate and honorable , ' @entity6 spokesman @entity189 said			0
' we were respectful and diligent in carrying out her wishes in the handling of resources provided to the @entity6			0
' in a separate lawsuit , @entity153 said in a 2001 deposition that she had ' complete confidence and trust ' in the @entity6 , despite never asking details of its activities			0
@entity153 said she had met with @entity10 and he told her the @entity6 was ' in a crunch			1
' ' we only ask @entity206 for what we need , ' @entity10 said , according to her testimony			0
she replied , '' and the angel @entity210 came down from heaven			0
' my name is @entity153			0
' the legion did n't acknowledge @entity10 's children or the sexual abuse allegations against him until february 2009 , about a year after he died			2
she said she was never directly asked for money but it was ' understood ' that she 'd help whenever the @entity6 needed it			0
' when i , through the grapevine , hear that something is going on and they know it , it 's understood if i can help , i 'd be very glad to , ' she said			0
' because i have total confidence , you see			0
whatever they do is part of my life			0
' @entity230 , the lawyer for @entity153 's niece , said taken as a whole , the depositions expose how the @entity6 knew by 2004 that the @entity25 was investigating @entity10 for sexual abuse and by 2006 that he had a daughter yet kept the information private			1
he argued that @entity153 never would have given the @entity6 her money had she known of @entity10 's true nature			1
' in terms of fraud , when you withhold information from people , that 's the same as if you said something to them that 's not true , ' he said			0
@entity67 also confirmed he was a member of a committee of three @entity6 priests who met annually to decide how to distribute funds from @entity153 's trusts			2
a superior court judge ruled in september that @entity153 's niece , @entity180 , could n't sue , but he noted there was evidence that @entity153 had been unduly persuaded to change her trusts and will .			0
