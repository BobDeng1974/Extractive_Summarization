a million housewives every day pick up a tin of beans and say ... well , that was the advertising jingle that was seen in more than a million homes every day			2
and now it is all changing			2
the humble baked bean has had a luxury makeover			1
no , not just mini pork sausages or mini burgers ... from tomorrow , the @entity11 ’s grocer @entity10 is offering up gourmet baked beans — at £ 3.95 a tub			1
like the traditional tinned variety , @entity14 can be heated up on the hob or in the microwave			0
but there the similarities stop			0
two of the exotic new beans being sold by @entity10 unlike their tinned cousins , @entity14 have to be kept in the fridge and are available in four ( not 57 ) varieties , including @entity25 , and @entity26			1
the range is the brainchild of 33 - year - old @entity30 @entity29			0
‘ some people said , “ you ’re completely crazy , ” ’ he says			0
‘ most people think that beans ca n’t change			0
’ the proper beans range goes on sale in @entity10 at £ 3.95 a tub but he is hoping for a case of history repeating itself			2
