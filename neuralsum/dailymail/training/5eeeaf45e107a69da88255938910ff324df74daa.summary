move over @entity0 , this weekend it is the @entity2 – my dark metallic purple @entity5 with @entity7 yellow ' go faster ' battle stripes – that is hitting the election campaign trail			1
still , after @entity11 deputy leader @entity10 's lipstick - pink ' woman to woman ' minibus so spectacularly backfired on its launch last week , i thought it would be wise to consult my wife @entity17 about my own campaign slogan before the @entity19 was delivered to a @entity21 firm for its @entity7 makeover			1
' anything but @entity24 , vote for @entity25 , ' she replied sharply			1
@entity7 's head of policy , @entity7 , suggested ' @entity27 needs cash ' – in reference to the constituency i 'll be fighting for @entity7 in may			1
' well , you do n't disobey the boss , especially not a woman , so i made up stripes with her suggestion , along with @entity7 - isms such as ' a return to @entity35 '			1
this item of campaign wisdom came from my mother , neighbour ( and long - serving political wife of @entity51 mp sir @entity25 ) who came into my kitchen within an hour of my new purple @entity19 being parked visibly in our shared courtyard			1
' what on earth is that ? ' she exclaimed			2
well , it proves the car is eye - catching … and yes , the postman will find it bizarre to pull up next to two campaign battle wagons , both saying ' @entity66 ' – only decked out in different political colours			2
the only other piece of advice my mother gave me was to take the slogans off when not in the constituency i 'll be fighting			2
' voters get confused about names			2
that 's why politicians use magnets , so they can take them off easily			1
' then we walked outside and inspected my new vehicle			2
despite being built in 1998 , the car is was what the trade refer to as ' immaculate '			0
the classic car ad that caught my eye ran : ' very rare purple metallic with cream leather			0
top - of - the - range model with all the usual refinements expected			0
needs to be seen and driven to appreciate the condition			0
' as my mother admired the sleek @entity19 lines and finest @entity93 hide upholstery , did i detect i tinge of campaign car jealously ? back - fired : @entity95 says the pink bus deputy labour leader @entity97 used in a bid to get women voting ' spectacularly backfired ' the search had not been easy			1
i nearly bought a silver 1987 @entity5 from a dealer in the @entity102			1
it was advertised for just £ 950 , which made me slightly nervous			0
when i got inside , i understood why			0
the polished mahogany dashboard had half curled off , the steering wheel was off - kilter and , the indicators did n't work			0
such an @entity108 - style rust - heap was n't going to fit the bill			0
finally , i tracked this one down to @entity110 , being sold by a former hotel owner			0
he had decided that parking his ' @entity113 ' in central @entity110 was asking for trouble			0
' there are pubs which open at 9am and so many people are just layabouts , ' he said as we cruised along the seafront where many shops and bars were boarded up			0
he wanted £ 2,450 but we settled at £ 2,075			0
the @entity19 is not a rich man 's car			1
the car is now named after @entity126 , who rode through @entity127 naked to get her husband to abolish high taxes in the 11th century			0
as my party 's tourism spokesman , i 'll be using the @entity19 to tour the countryside and coastal regions of @entity134 , to promote more visits to our hidden gems			1
but as much as i am opposed to higher taxes , i can not promise my wife will be inside naked			0
the owner of @entity10 's much mocked ' @entity0 ' could face a £ 1,000 fine for not registering the makeover with the authorities			2
the @entity144 , right , is licensed with the @entity145 as being white , but for the ' woman to woman ' campaign it has been given a pink vinyl wrap			2
the @entity149 was told by the @entity145 that the owner of the van hired by @entity11 to tour constituencies could face prosecution for the change in colour , for which its @entity157 log book should have been amended			1
a spokesman added that they may face no action if the change was ' temporary ' but could not specify up to how long that might be			0
the bus is due to remain pink for three months until the @entity164 in may			1
@entity11 said the bus was hired from a rental company , which officials declined to name , but added : ' we 've informed them			1
it 's up to them to talk to the @entity145			2
