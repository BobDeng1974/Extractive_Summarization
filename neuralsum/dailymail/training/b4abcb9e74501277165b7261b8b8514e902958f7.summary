by @entity0 are there ways to help you and your partner orgasm at the same time ? the myth of the simultaneous orgasm is still clutching onto the bed sheets tenaciously - and judging by the amount of couples on telly still moaning ' yes ! yes ! yes ! ' in unison , it 's going to hang on there for some time yet			1
the reality is , you 'd be hard pressed to find the same scene recreated in bedrooms at home because couples rarely climax together			0
let 's take a look at the facts			0
roughly 75 % of men in relationships always have an orgasm with their partner , compared to 30 % of women			1
men 's orgasms last around 5 - 10 seconds ( if he 's lucky ) , women 's orgasms can last 15 seconds or more ( much more , if she 's lucky and he 's adept )			2
do the math and you 'll soon see the chances of both of you orbiting into orgasmic ecstasy at exactly the same moment is highly unlikely			0
likely , no. quite frankly , taking turns - you have your orgasm first , he has his later - is not only more practical , it 's sometimes a lot more satisfying			1
having an orgasm is a selfish experience : you 're totally and utterly fixated on your own pleasure			0
having to pay attention to your partner 's bits to guarantee they 're enjoying themselves at exactly the same moment does n't enhance the experience , it interferes with it for men , this is less of a problem			1
their orgasms are easier to trigger and once triggered , continue			0
women 's require a lot more attention and , unless tended from start to finish , can halt or merely trickle away halfway through			2
while he 's twitching and moaning with orgasmic joy , we 're often twitching and moaning with resentment at having been robbed at the last moment			0
yes simultaneous orgasm can be an incredibly bonding moment but you 're still better off making it a pleasant bonus rather than an aim			2
women 's require a lot more attention and , unless tended from start to finish , can halt or merely trickle away halfway through ' the best tip i could possibly give you to achieve simultaneous orgasm is to make friends with her vibrator '			1

simultaneous orgasms are , *largely* , a myth
75 % of men always have orgasms during *****sex***** , but only 30 % of women do
taking turns is more practical , says leading *****sex***** expert @entity0
' the best tip i could possibly give you to achieve simultaneous orgasm is to make friends with her vibrator ' get him to have an orgasm first and make the ' together ' orgasm the second one . most men find they have much better control second time around .
*ignore* the old *advice* of getting him to think about *big* pants or count *backwards* . the aim is *distraction* but it simply does n't work . new *research* shows even as he 's *manically* saying ' *459* , *458* ' in his brain , another part is saying ' what does he think i am , *stupid* ? as if this is going to grab my attention when i *'ve* got a pair of breasts *bobbling* in front of me , my penis is *nestled* in a nice , warm , *****sex*****y place , my *girlfriend* 's moaning and throwing her head back and *â€¦* . '
use the **bridge** *manoeuvre* : this is the *technique* most *****sex***** *therapists* *recommend* . the *basic* idea is to give you ***clitoral*** ***stimulation*** up to the point of , but not actually to , orgasm and let his *thrusting* trigger off the orgastic *reflex* . this ***effective**ly* provides a ' **bridge** ' between ***clitoral*** ***stimulation*** and intercourse .
choose the right *position* . woman on top or him from behind are the most likely *position*s to stimulate the front *vaginal* wall and up your chances of a **penetrative** orgasm .
talk lots , telling each other exactly where you 're at by using a number *system* . groaning out a ' @entity165 ! ' or delivering a curt ' still two ' might seem *odd* to start , but it 's a quick and **effective** way to *communicate* in bed .
*switch* ***stimulation*** *regularly* . not only will it keep you both *hovering* rather than climbing *steadily* toward a climax , it stops *****sex***** becoming too orgasm *focused* . change *position*s . change rooms . change the *cd* . anything to change the mood , keeping it *hot* and *****sex*****y but *maintaining* a measure of control .
make friends with her vibrator . if you asked me the best tip i could possibly give you to achieve simultaneous orgasm , this would be it . one of you holding a wand vibrator ( slim , *cylindrical* , *non-intrusive* ) over the ***clitoral*** area during **penetrative** *****sex***** is the most **effective** way to ensure a *shared* orgasm experience .
