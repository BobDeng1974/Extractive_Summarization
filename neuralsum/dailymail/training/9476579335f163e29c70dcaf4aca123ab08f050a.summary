by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ the day of reckoning has arrived for @entity2 with @entity3 facing @entity4 here in a @entity7 game they must win			1
with @entity2 set to move into his favoured central position after his unsatisfactory role on the left against @entity11 , he must deliver the goals which @entity14 ’s team desperately need			1
@entity4 were defensively woeful in their opening defeat by @entity16 and have been weakened by the absence tonight of the suspended @entity18 and the injury to captain @entity20			1
the pressure is clearly on him yet a few weeks ago , when @entity2 was training in @entity35 with his @entity3 team - mates , he seemed determined to enjoy the @entity7			1
he was relaxed and refreshed after spending a few days working with @entity3 ’s fitness coaches in the build - up to the tournament			2
this evening , when he takes to the field at the @entity43 in his no 10 shirt , the @entity3 forward will face further scrutiny			2
it will be that way until he scores his first goal at a @entity7			0
the @entity4 game will be his 10th attempt to get off the mark at this level			2
under pressure : @entity3 striker @entity2 must break his @entity7 goal jinx @entity54 : @entity4 v @entity3 - fan predictions at the age of 28 , he also declared on the eve of the tournament that this was the last chance to ‘ get the best out of me ’ at a @entity7			1
every @entity3 fan wants him to score , to retrace the magical steps that turned him into one of the world ’s most feared strikers when he first played for the national team			2
at @entity69 he scored four times before he was forced off against @entity35 through injury in the quarter - final			0
during @entity3 ’s @entity7 qualifiers , @entity2 was always played in a central role			1
he responded with seven goals			0
‘ he ’s been our top scorer for the past two years and he has more goals and assists than anyone else , ’ said @entity14 yesterday			2
influence : @entity2 set up @entity81 for @entity3 's goal against @entity11 on saturday ‘ were it not for his wonderful header against @entity84 in the qualifiers we might not even be here			1
we ’ve got a clear perspective as to what @entity2 is and what @entity2 can do			2
when you start talking about one man it ’s not @entity92 ’s got broad shoulders and i think he will do well at the tournament			0
unfortunately , he just has to accept that it often happens at a @entity7			0
at the moment he ’s getting a lot of support from those around him			0
’ against @entity11 on saturday he was stuck out on the left and asked to track back to help left back @entity100			0
he provided the assist for @entity81 ’s first @entity7 goal , clipping the ball into the penalty area for the striker to score			0
that contribution , typical of @entity2 ’s selfless attitude , was largely overlooked in the analysis of his display against @entity11			1
there were other areas , particularly in defence , that will have been of more pressing concern to the head coach			0
@entity2 did more running than any other @entity3 player and seems to have done enough to satisfy @entity14			1
focused : @entity2 during training for thursday 's crunch clash against @entity4 ‘ we ’re very happy with what the team did and @entity2 worked very hard like the rest of the team but we did n’t discuss , even in the coaches ’ debrief , the individual players			1
’ although it was n’t vintage @entity2 , he still has the ability to turn games in @entity3 ’s @entity129 , captain @entity21 revealed that the attention is beginning to eat away at @entity2			1
‘ he is slightly frustrated being the centre of attention and everyone talking about his position , ’ admitted @entity21			0
‘ in training he has been fine and looking to the match			0
for me , against @entity11 he had a big say in the match with an assist and i thought he did exactly what the manager had asked him to do			0
on the ball : @entity2 and @entity145 during training at the @entity43 in @entity147 on wednesday ‘ for all the players it is frustrating that one player is getting spoken about more than anyone else because we are all sticking together and trying to fight for the same thing			2
’ @entity2 has certainly been working hard and @entity154 , @entity3 ’s assistant manager , was n’t exaggerating when he told @entity155 that he has to be dragged off the training pitches			1
on tuesday , @entity2 was restored to his favoured central position during an intensive 90 - minute training session			0
the signs are that he will operate behind @entity81 this evening			0
if that is the case , @entity2 will have got his way — forcing @entity14 ’s hand for a match that @entity3 must win .			1

@entity2 did more running than any other @entity3 player against @entity11
@entity2 must repay @entity14 's faith in him and fire @entity3 towards the knockout stage
@entity4 have been weakened by the absence of @entity18 and @entity20
