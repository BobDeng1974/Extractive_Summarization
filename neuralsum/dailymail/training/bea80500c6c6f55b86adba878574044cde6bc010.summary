by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 12:51 est , 2 november 2012 updated : 21:09 est , 2 november 2012 plants could be given ‘ passports ’ under radical proposals to stop the spread of disease and prevent a repeat of the ash tree crisis			1
government scientists want every plant sold in @entity12 and the @entity13 to be inspected and provided with labels to guarantee they are free of pests and blight			0
staff in garden centres would be responsible for issuing the ‘ plant passports ’ , with @entity21 inspectors visiting twice a year to conduct audits of random batches			1
an ash tree in @entity25 - but experts say 19 in 20 of the @entity28 population could die as @entity30 dieback spreads if the legislation is passed , it would mean any nursery failing to comply with the passport system would not be allowed to operate			1
the proposal came as emergency talks in @entity37 yesterday failed to produce a strategy to deal with the ash tree dieback crisis			1
as reports emerged of the fungal disease spreading to @entity43 , the environment secretary emerged from the government ’s @entity45 meeting and stated that more analysis was needed before a solution could be found			1
last night , critics dismissed the plant passport proposal as ‘ academic ’ and called for the government to take urgent action to save @entity12 ’s ash trees instead			1
gardeners would foot the bill for the passport scheme , which would see all safe plants issued with a label to certify they are healthy , and all unsafe plants destroyed			0
the idea was outlined at another meeting of scientists by @entity64 , leader of the tree health programme at @entity67 ’s @entity66			0
he said : ‘ plant passport involves nurseries issuing a label which would then be stuck to the plant pot. if we protect plants this way , we will be in a better place in the future than we are now			0
’ he added the passports would be issued for all specimens that are ‘ for planting ’ – referring to potted plants rather than cut flowers and fruits			0
if the proposal is adopted , every country in the @entity13 would be asked to have inspectors overseeing the issue of passports			0
plants coming in from outside the @entity13 are already required to have a certificate to prove they are safe , and a @entity93 plant passport system already exists for high - risk plants such as fruit trees , rose trees and rhododendrons			1
mr @entity64 said the new plan would simply mean rolling this out further – with the cost of the extra bureaucracy passed on to the customer via the grower			0
but @entity104 , of the @entity105 , said : ‘ even if you have a plant passport , you can only sell the plant in a pest - free area or else it may be re-contaminated			2
‘ it ’s a bit academic at the moment , although it ’s a possible help once pest - free areas have been created			2
an @entity30 tree in woodland around @entity117 shedding it 's leaves - as fears are rising the disease killing @entity30 trees is spreading ‘ as for passing the cost on to the gardener , it ’s not an effective way to raise funds			1
the government needs to take responsibility for it			0
’ yesterday ’s @entity45 meeting of ministers , experts and officials heard that a mass survey of 3,000 areas in @entity12 would be carried out to produce a clearer picture of the extent of the threat from ash dieback			2
environment secretary @entity140 said afterwards : ‘ we have had an assessment of the state of the disease			2
‘ we also had an assessment of the current survey , where we are looking at 2,900 10km squares right across the @entity12			0
scientists are warning that the disease , which has destroyed 90 % of all the @entity30 in @entity150 , could repeat the catastrophe that struck the nation 's elm tree population in the last century , from which it has still not recovered			1
‘ we also had a presentation on possible solutions – at the moment we do not have a cure for the disease – and also measures we might take			2
’ the @entity160 will report back to mr @entity140 next week with a final report on how far the blight has already spread			0
thought to have originated in @entity164 , the disease causes leaf loss and crown dieback and can lead to ash tree death			1
it has already wiped out up to 90 per cent of ash trees in some areas of @entity150 .			0

experts believe the disease could be far more *widespread* than *initially* thought - with one claiming 19 out of 20 trees could die
comes as @entity21 's emergency *committee* met to *discuss* the crisis
