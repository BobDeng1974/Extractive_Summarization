by @entity0 published : 08:20 est , 29 november 2013 @entity2 : 09:49 est , 29 november 2013 some of the messages are amusing slogans but most are filled with a lonely despair only felt by a soldier experiencing the bloody horrors of war			0
these rather personal epigrams were engraved on to the side of the @entity13 lighters of @entity15 soldiers , sailors and airmen during the @entity18			1
a collection of 282 lighters offering a rare insight into the mindset of military personnel fighting in the conflict was recently sold at auction for almost £ 22,000			1
epigrams : a collection of @entity13 lighters with the engravings of @entity15 servicemen who fought in @entity31 have been auctioned for almost £ 20,000 keepsakes : the lighters were all collected by @entity34 from the streets of @entity36 during the 1990s poignant : while some of the lighters contain amusing one liners , the markings on others give a real insight into the loneliness of serving at war the lighters were collected by @entity15 artist @entity34 during the 1990s who bought them off the streets of @entity49			1
among the inscriptions is a lighter that reads : ' when i die i 'll go to heaven because i 've spent my time in hell			0
' another reads : ' when the power to love overcomes the love of power only then will there be a chance for true peace			0
' one simply reads : ' to mom , from a lonely paratrooper , @entity64			0
' collection : @entity34 initially used the lighters to create unique works of art but says that the collection took on a life of its own big business : because of a surge in interest in souvenirs from @entity31 , there is now a big market for fake lighters , says @entity34 @entity78 : some of the messages carried by the lighters are more serious than others another says : ' a sucking chest wound is nature 's way of telling you you 've been ambushed			1
' @entity34 initially used them to create various works of art , but says that his collection eventually took on a life of their own			1
he said : ' i 'm fascinated with the lighters as they are a window into the minds and experiences of the men experiencing a certain place and time			2
' i had used the lighters as inspiration and media in my art , but the collection itself has grown to be a statement of its own			2
' over the years @entity34 says he has handled thousands of genuine @entity108			1
enthusiast : @entity34 says that he has handled hundreds of the lighters over the years kit : the lighters were often used as part of day to day combat with certain tasks becoming known as @entity13 missions service : many of the lighters include the years in which their owners served in @entity31 and their platoon but an increasing demand from foreign tourists for mementos has led to a growing number of fake items entering the market			1
@entity34 said : ' there are no real zippos in @entity31 now			1
' used for lighting cigarettes , heating food , illuminating letters from home , or setting fire to huts of suspected @entity138 , @entity108 were used so frequently in search and destroy missions that @entity141 nicknamed them ' @entity143 ' or ' @entity144			0
' the @entity18 , which ran from 1959 to 1975 , was a bloody @entity145 - era conflict that claimed millions of lives and left countless soldiers and natives traumatised by what they had endured			0
bloody : soldiers in action during the @entity18			0
