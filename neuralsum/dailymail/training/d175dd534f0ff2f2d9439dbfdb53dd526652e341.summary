@entity0 says his elevation to the job of @entity4 manager has been ‘ tainted ’ by the turmoil of close friend @entity7 ’s departure			1
@entity0 was called to @entity8 on sunday evening by chief executive @entity9 to be told he would be replacing @entity7 until the end of the season at least			1
his first task was to tell legend @entity13 he had been demoted on board instructions			1
now faced with catching runaway league leaders @entity16 and breathing life into a flagging promotion push at a time of unprecedented chaos , @entity0 also revealed that @entity7 had made an emotional farewell speech to the players on monday urging them to make him proud by pipping their @entity24 rivals to the @entity27 title			1
@entity0 was placed in temporary charge of @entity4 following @entity7 's departure however , flanked by his new coaching team of @entity30 – who has swapped jobs with @entity13 – and new player - coach @entity32 , @entity0 used his first media conference to admit his dream job had arrived in grim circumstances			1
with a shrug he said : ‘ it ’s tainted , is n’t it ? what can you do ? i ’ve got to try and make the best of a bad situation			2
‘ yesterday was a sad day			2
@entity43 came in to say goodbye to the players and staff			2
the man that he is , he finished by saying nothing would make him more proud than if they went on to win the title			2
the biggest tribute we can do is to try and pull that off			0
it would be for @entity7			0
’ @entity0 , whose first game is at @entity56 on saturday , half expected to follow @entity7 out the door after @entity9 called him to the stadium			1
@entity0 was part of @entity7 's backroom staff at @entity8 , but has now taken the top job at @entity8 ‘ it is normally the case in normal situations			1
but , at the end of the day , boards do what boards do			0
i ca n’t control what ’s happened			0
i have just got to be professional and try to get the boys up for the game and get them back winning			0
’ missing from the technical area will be @entity13 after the former first - team coach was demoted to under 20s coach			1
revealing he was left with little option but to break the news to his long - term colleague , @entity0 added : ‘ as soon as they asked me to carry out my duties to take the first team they asked me if i would inform the boys of the changes they wanted to make			1
’ asked if that was a task the board themselves should have undertaken , @entity0 replied : ‘ possibly			1
that is open for debate			0
but they asked me if i would do it which i duly did			0
@entity30 will assist @entity0 as he tries to claw back a big gap to leaders @entity16 ‘ it was n’t easy , but the boys fully understand because at the moment there is a lot going on , a lot of positions moving about , and mine was one of them			1
i had to explain it was a board decision and the boys respected that and just got on with it			2
’ asked to explain the rationale behind the board ’s changes , he shrugged : ‘ i ’ve no idea			2
you ’d have to ask the board			2
’ @entity0 claimed @entity7 ’s resignation had come out of the blue despite their close friendship			1
asked when he knew of his plans , he insisted : ‘ the morning it came out in the paper , believe it or not			0
i did n’t realise he was doing it			0
he was obviously thinking long and hard about doing it			0
‘ it was a surprise to me as much as anything			0
but i fully expected him to be here for the year and do the notice			0
it did n’t happen like that so we have to get on with it			0

@entity0 has been placed in *caretaker* charge for the rest of the season
he was ordered by the board to inform @entity13 he had been demoted
@entity0 will be assisted at @entity8 by @entity30 and @entity32
