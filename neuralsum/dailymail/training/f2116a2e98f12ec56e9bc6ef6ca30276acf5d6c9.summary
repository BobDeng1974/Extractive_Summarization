by @entity0 published : 13:00 est , 4 july 2013 updated : 03:30 est , 5 july 2013 a 67 - year - old man has a rare brain defect which causes him to hear people speak before he sees their lips move			2
the end result is that all of his conversations resemble a badly dubbed film where the sound and actions are out of sync			0
the man , known only as @entity13 , is the first confirmed case of the disorder where his brain processes sight significantly slower than sound			1
living in a badly dubbed world : a 67 - year - old man hears people speak before he sees their lips move making all of his conversations appear out of sync ( stock image ) @entity13 first started suffering the unusual symptoms after undergoing surgery			1
' i said to my daughter " hey , you 've got two tvs that need sorting ! ' " , he told @entity31			0
but @entity13 then realised that he was hearing his own voice before feeling his jaw move			0
doctors conducted scans of his brain which showed two lesions in areas that potentially play a role in hearing , timing and movement			1
light and sound travel at different speeds , so visual and auditory inputs arrive at the eyes and ears at different times			0
the signals are then processed at different rates in the brain but still appear as though they are happening simultaneously			0
possible cause : the 67 - year - old , only known as @entity13 , only started suffering the symptoms after undergoing surgery			1
scans show he has two lesions in the areas of the brain which play a role in hearing , timing and movement ( stock image ) @entity13 's brain is believed to processes visual input much slower than it processes sound - causing the large time discrepancy			1
@entity71 and colleagues at @entity73 performed several temporal order judgement tests using video clips to confirm the condition			0
they found that they had to play the sound 200 milliseconds later for @entity13 to view it as in sync with the visual action mr @entity71 is now looking for a way to slow down @entity13 's hearing so it matches what he is seeing .			2

the man , known only as @entity13 , started suffering the unusual sight and sound discrepancy *shortly* after undergoing surgery
scans show he has two lesions in areas of the brain which potentially play a role in hearing , timing and movement
