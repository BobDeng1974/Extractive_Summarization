@entity0 admits he will fulfil his boyhood dream if he earns his first @entity3 cap against @entity4 on wednesday night			1
the @entity6 defender has been given his first taste of top - team action at @entity9 by new boss @entity10 this season			1
now he is set to follow that up by making his international debut in @entity14 when @entity16 's side take on the @entity17 at @entity18			1
@entity0 has made an impressive breakthrough for @entity6 this season at the back the 19 - year - old was forced to pull out of his first involvement with the national team last october due to injury , while he was an unused substitute a month later as the @entity25 lost 2 - 0 away to @entity26			1
but he is expected to finally pull on the green jersey in the midweek friendly clash that will serve as a warm - up ahead of sunday 's crucial @entity31 qualifier with @entity32 at @entity33			1
' it would be a dream come true if that happens , ' said the teenage centre - half			1
' as a young boy it is a dream to play for your country			1
' i went to a few @entity3 games when i was very young but i do n't remember too much about them			2
i can remember the atmosphere and hoping that one day i would be out there as well , so if i can do that on wednesday i will be very proud			0
' the @entity48 competes with the @entity50 's newest star @entity49 at @entity51 wednesday 's match will be just as important to the @entity17 as it is @entity16 's troops as both countries look to end their long absences from major tournaments by claiming a slot at next year 's @entity58 in @entity59			2
while @entity3 are just a point off the summit of @entity64 after taking nine points from the first 12 available , @entity61 's side are very much in the hunt themselves			1
they sit third in @entity68 , three points behind leaders @entity71 and level on seven with @entity73 and the @entity74			0
with that in mind , @entity0 does not expect an easy introduction to the international game			2
' it 's going to be tough , ' he said			0
' it 's a game against another home nation and both teams want to win			0
it wo n't be a friendly			0
the 19 - year - old has seen his game time limited in recent weeks but has done enough to earn a call - up ' it 's a game we can definitely win , though			1
we showed in the games in the qualifying group we can beat anybody			0
' @entity4 have some very good players			2
i 've played against @entity94 earlier on this season and you can see why people rate him so highly			2
' @entity0 can also expect to come up against another familiar face clad in @entity99 , with former @entity6 midfielder @entity100 likely to line - up for the hosts			1
the 31 - year - old - who quit the @entity104 in january after 12 years to sign for @entity106 - played an influential dressing - room role while @entity0 was making his way through the @entity9 ranks			1
@entity100 ( right ) was influential in helping @entity0 settle into the @entity6 dressing room before he left and the youngster happily admits he owes the four - time @entity50 winner a huge debt of gratitude			1
' @entity100 really helped me a lot and have to thank him a lot for that , ' said @entity0			2
' when i first broke into the team he gave me a lot of advice and really did help me settle in			0
' when you come through at @entity6 , it is such a big club with so much pressure on you			2
' @entity100 was in the same position i 'm in now at one stage so he would often come up to me before games and have a word to make sure my head was on right			0
' @entity100 is a great player and i 'm very happy to see him back playing regularly with @entity106			0
' @entity10 took a risk on @entity0 when he had a shortage of defenders and was rewarded for his trust in the 13 games @entity0 has racked for @entity135 's side this term , he has done enough to leave the @entity137 so impressed that he reckons the @entity139 youth could be a mainstay of the @entity6 line - up for the next decade			1
but @entity0 himself is trying not to look too far ahead			0
he said : ' i do n't think i will really realise how good a season i have had until the end of the season when i look back at it , but so far i 'm very happy			0
' am i surprised at how quickly things have gone this year ? yeah a little bit			0
' sometimes you just need a bit of luck to get your chance			0
but i was confident that once i got my chance i could take it			0
