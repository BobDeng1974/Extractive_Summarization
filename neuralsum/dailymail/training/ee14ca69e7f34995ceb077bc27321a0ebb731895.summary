@entity2 @entity1 candidate @entity0 wants @entity3 to know she is most definitely not president @entity4 , and she even wields a gun in her latest campaign ad , released today to prove it			1
the entire 30 - second ad takes place in a field where @entity0 shoots skeet while she mocks senate minority leader @entity12 , her opponent in the race , and lists off the issues she disagrees with the unpopular @entity2 president on			1
' @entity12 wants you to think i 'm @entity4			1
@entity12 is the same guy who thought @entity19 basketball players were @entity20 , ' @entity0 says , referring to an ad the @entity23 campaign released that confused the state 's two college basketball teams			1
' i disagree with him on guns , coal and the @entity35			0
' and @entity12 , that 's not how you hold a gun , ' she says , flashing a photo of @entity23 holding a gun upside down at the @entity41 in march			2
@entity23 's gesture was a throwback to actor @entity45 's presentation at the @entity47 's annual convention in 2000 , not a befuddled attempt at holding a fire arm			0
the @entity0 campaign sunk it 's teeth into into the move however after a conservative news publication revealed that @entity23 may not own a gun			1
' of course sen. @entity23 has shot a gun , ' a spokesperson for @entity23 's campaign told the @entity58 , ' but as a matter of principle he 's not interested in helping the left bully people into revealing what protection they may keep in their own homes			0
' @entity23 's @entity1 staff would n't confirm to reporters whether the @entity67 politician owned a gun either			2
in response to @entity0 ' ad hitting @entity23 over the gun incident , @entity12 campaign spokesperson @entity69 said : ' an inexperienced @entity4 liberal with a gun is no less dangerous ‎ for @entity76 families than one without			1
' much of @entity0 ' financial support comes from those seeking to implement gun control and wage the war on coal but cynically she believes a recycled tv ad idea will fool @entity3 , ' she added			1
@entity0 shoots skeet in her video , however a handful of other @entity88 and @entity1 candidates released ads of themselves shooting copies of @entity91 and other legislation backed by the president to distance themselves from his policies			1
in her ad @entity0 makes fun of @entity23 for not knowing his way around a firearm , as evidenced by this photo of him at the annual @entity41 in march			2
@entity23 was purposefully holding the gun upside down , however , in a throw back to a move made by actor @entity45 at another conservative conference more than a decade ago while @entity0 may know her way around a firearm better than her opponent , it 's @entity23 who has the backing of the largest gun lobbying organization			2
the @entity47 endorsed @entity23 in the race last week and gave him an @entity115 - it 's highest rating - on @entity117 rights			0
' the true measure of leadership and courage comes during moments of adversity and leader @entity23 has stood steadfast with @entity127 ’s law - abiding gun owners during the most trying of times , ' @entity118 , chairman of the @entity119 said in a statement			0
' he has fought against sweeping gun and ammo bans and supported substantive efforts that rightfully place the burden of our justice system on violent criminals			0
leader @entity23 also led the effort in the @entity1 last year to defeat @entity4 and @entity139 ’s gun control agenda			1
' @entity0 skeet shooting ad is the candidate 's response to a 30 - second ad @entity23 's campaign put out last week that seeks to tie @entity0 to @entity91 , the rising national debt , the flood of unaccompanied minors coming over the @entity127 ' southern border and @entity4 's claim that ' we do n't have a strategy yet ' to deal with @entity150 in @entity151			1
as side by side photos of @entity4 and @entity0 appear on screen , the ad 's narrator claims that ' @entity4 needs @entity0			1
' the president has had a low approval rating among all @entity127 for several months , but he is especially unpopular in @entity76			2
a poll taken in may by several @entity76 news organizations found that just 29 percent of @entity127 had a favorable opinion of the president			0
a majority , 57 percent , said they did not have a positive opinion of him			0
at the time , @entity23 also had a low favorability rating , but @entity3 have since warmed back up to @entity23 faced with the prospect of electing @entity0 instead			0
' the people in @entity76 made up their mind about @entity12 a long time ago			2
... they would be happy to replace him but ... she has n't given them any reasons to be for her , ' @entity2 consultant @entity170 told @entity175 on sunday			0
' something 's got to be done a lot different , ' he added , ' because what 's happening is n't working			0
' with less than 50 days until the election , @entity23 is now leading @entity0 by an average of five points in polls , according to multiple polls taken in the several weeks .			0

@entity76 *democrat* @entity0 is running for the @entity1 seat currently held by @entity12
@entity0 tries to distance herself from the unpopular @entity4 in a new campaign ad by wielding a gun and shooting skeet
' i 'm not @entity4 , ' @entity0 , who is *female* and white , says at one point in the ad
