the impact of a six - mile long asteroid believed to have hit the earth and wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago would have sparked a cataclysmic firestorm , scientists say			1
over the past three decades scientists have argued about what caused the extinction 66 million years ago - changes to climate , volcano activity or an asteroid			1
research has already shown that the prehistoric animals died out around the same time a six - mile long object hit the planet , and a new model of the disaster suggests the asteroid 's impact would have sent vaporised particles of rock high above @entity23 's atmosphere which in turn would have turned the sky bright red as they heated the upper atmosphere to 2,700 degrees @entity28 on re-entry			1
cosmic explosion : an asteroid hitting the planet sounded the death knell of dinosaurs a team from the @entity36 have come up with a model of the disaster that shows how the asteroid 's impact heated up the @entity23 's atmosphere to levels that would have incinerated anything not underground or underwater			1
( impression of dinosaurs feeding ) ' it 's likely that the total amount of infrared heat was equal to a 1 megaton bomb exploding every four miles over the entire @entity23 , ' study researcher @entity45 , of the @entity36 , or @entity36 , said in a statement reported in @entity51			2
to put this into perspective , a 1 - megaton hydrogen bomb is said to be the equivalent of 80 @entity57 - type nuclear bombs			0
the model , detailed this week in the @entity60 - @entity59 shows how the ' heat pulse ' would have incinerated the world 's forests and everything else not protected underground or underwater			1
the global firestorm theory has been aired before , with some scientists claiming that much of the intense radiation would have been shielded from @entity23 by the falling rock			0
factoring in this heat reduction , @entity70 and his team maintain the atmosphere would still have been hot enough to ignite the world 's forests			1
the team 's claim is bolstered by evidence of a layer of soot at the @entity23 's 65 million - year - old @entity80 which would be consistent with global fires			2
some scientists argue that the charcoal 's presence is in fact from the impact of the asteroid itself - an argument countered by @entity45 who says the asteroid alone would not have created quite this much			1
end of the dinosaur age : a depiction of a tyrannosaur as the asteroid strikes ' our data show the conditions back then are consistent with widespread fires across the planet , ' said @entity45			2
' those conditions resulted in 100 per cent extinction rates for about 80 percent of all life on @entity23			0
' the asteroid 's impact near the town of @entity106 in @entity107 left a crater more than 110 miles ( 180 kilometers ) wide			1
the explosion itself would have released as much energy as 100 trillion tons of @entity112 , more than a billion times more than the atom bombs that destroyed @entity57 and @entity114			0
while the impact may not have been the sole cause of the dinosaur extinction , it almost definitely dealt the death blow , said researchers in february at @entity122 's @entity121 in @entity123			1
director @entity124 said : ' we have shown that these events are synchronous to within a gnat ’s eyebrow			0
' therefore the impact clearly played a major role in extinctions , but it probably was n’t just the impact			2
the impact was clearly the final straw that pushed @entity23 past the tipping point			2
' the asteroid collision with @entity23 has now been dated to 66,038,000 years ago			0
the new extinction date is precise to within 11,000 years			0
before the cosmic explosion , many creatures were brought to the brink of extinction by dramatic climate swings in the preceding million years , including long cold snaps			0
researchers used high - precision radiometric dating analysis of debris kicked up by the impact which would have radioactive materials within them			0
the extinction of the dinosaurs was first linked to a comet or asteroid impact in 1980 by the late @entity122 nobel laureate @entity155 and his son , @entity156 , who is a @entity122 professor emeritus of earth and planetary science			1
the @entity160 researchers maintain that the conditions resulted in 100 per cent extinction rates for about 80 percent of all life on @entity23			0

new model of disaster suggests asteroid 's impact would have heated atmosphere to 2,700 degrees @entity28
@entity171 would have incinerated the world 's forests and everything else not protected underground or underwater
