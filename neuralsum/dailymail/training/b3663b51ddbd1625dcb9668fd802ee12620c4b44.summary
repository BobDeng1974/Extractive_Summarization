do n't look down : photographer @entity8 , 24 , captures amazing pictures of his friends balancing on highlines up to 450 feet in the air balancing act : the pictures were taken as @entity8 's friends walked above canyons in @entity10 , @entity11 , and @entity12 in @entity13 focus : @entity8 compares highlining to meditation , saying it is less about physical ability and more about relaxing and enjoying the experience monkey business : highliner @entity19 dangles above a canyon using just his feet as @entity8 captures the moment in @entity10 , @entity11 @entity8 said : ' walking across a rope so high feels different for everyone it 's a balance of fear and joy			1
once you are able to calm down and settle in it 's a really meditative experience			0
' @entity51 is definitely not about getting all pumped up on energy and adrenaline			0
it 's about everything all coming together at once and enjoying being in that moment with the natural world			0
' really , highlining is a lot like life : you take it one step at a time until you overcome the obstacle you are facing and are back on solid ground again			0
' despite the death - defying appearance of these pictures , all the highliners are actually tied on to their lines by safety ropes , which are double knotted and ensure that any fall only lasts for a couple of feet			2
natural beauty : @entity8 says highlinging is about relaxing and enjoying a moment of peace out in the natural world , and his photography reflects that are you sure that 's safe ? @entity8 says the highliners use two safety ropes to ensure that if they fall , they only drop a few feet before they 're left hanging adventurous : @entity8 's photography focuses on extreme sports and the outdoors , with most of his pictures taken in @entity13 exhausted : a highliner picks and odd spot to relax while midway across a huge canyon in @entity10 , @entity11 the key to successful highlining is to control your breathing and focus on the other end of the line where it attaches to an object and walk towards that , using outstretched arms for balance			1

seeing double : the key to slacklining is to control your breathing , and focus on the point at the other end of the line where it attaches to an object and walk towards that watch where you 're going : a brave highliner makes his way between two boulders just before the sun sets and it gets too dark to see easy does it : the highliners can take up to ten minutes to complete just a short walk as they attempt to focus and use their sense of balance to stop the line from moving			1
