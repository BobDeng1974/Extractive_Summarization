a software glitch at @entity2 airport caused air traffic controllers to lose the position of at least nine planes on the tarmac			1
the @entity8 committee was told by independent senator @entity9 the february 13 incident happened after integrated tower automation suite ( @entity12 ) - a program used for air traffic control - failed			1
he said he was informed there were at least nine aircrafts who were waiting on the tarmac to take off at the time the software glitch happened about 10pm			1
@entity21 's head of program for aviation @entity20 said this flaw in @entity12 had potential to trigger a similar incident to the one which happened on the @entity28 island of @entity29 , which is considered to be the worst accidents in aviation history			2
in 1977 , two @entity42 747s collided after thick fog prevented air traffic control and pilots to see there were two planes sharing the one runway , killing 583 people			2
there was no ground radar so the air traffic control could only rely on reports from radio communications			0
' for example , if there 's a plane on @entity59 , they 're holding them there but then they 're not in the system , the controller could potentially put another plane in that spot , ' mr @entity20 told @entity67			2
senator @entity9 ( left ) told the @entity8 committee the incident happened on february 13 and was questioning @entity71 executive general manager of air traffic control @entity73 ( right ) if this happens then usually the pilot would see the other plane there and tell air traffic control			1
but mr @entity20 said this link in the ' safety chain ' would break if there was heavy fog			0
' now one plane could strike the other one , which is probably full of fuel , and it could cause an issue , ' he said			0
' this could happen yes ... but there are probably four or five scenarios we have n't thought of that could happen			0
' like @entity93 , we never thought a plane could disappear off the face of the earth			0
' i do n't know about you but i like people to know where the planes are			0
someone should know where they are at all times			0
' mr @entity20 said if there had been heavy fog then planes could have collided on the taxi runway on tuesday , senator @entity9 told @entity67 : ' there are genuine concerns of ongoing software problems with @entity12			1
' he said he had received complaints from air traffic controllers and pilots about the software , and their concerns needed to be looked into adequately			0
@entity71 's @entity73 told the committee the organisation had been informed about the situation and poor weather conditions had grounded planes for more than an hour			1
he said this length of inactivity caused a number of planes to disappear off their radar			2
' my understanding on that night in question [ was ] that there was thunderstorm activity and a number of aircraft that were taxiing in from the runway were unable to reach their gate , ' mr @entity73 told the committee			0
to fix this problem , the window of time for a plane to stay in the system had been extended to five hours			1
mr @entity73 said he did not anticipate hearing this line of enquiry from @entity9 but could give him more information if the politician wanted it			0
while the @entity71 general manager of air traffic control was speaking , the @entity151 representative said he had been sent a text by someone who had been there at time of the incident			1
senator @entity9 related the message to the committee , which said the idea that a thunderstorm had caused the glitch was ' crap ' as it had already passed over @entity2 .			1

senator @entity9 said the incident took place on february 13
he said he was told at least nine aircrafts were waiting to take off on tarmac
they were left on the runway for an hour and then *dropped* off the radar
an aviation *expert* said this issue could have caused planes to collide
@entity71 said they were aware of the incident in @entity2
amount of time a plane stays in system has been *increased* to five hours
