a mother - of - three was unable to recognise her daughters after being placed in a coma as her body fought toxic shock syndrome , caused by a tampon			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 in @entity8 , thought she was suffering a bout of flu when she fell ill. but three days later , slipping in and out of consciousness , she was rushed to hospital			2
there doctors told her family she was just hours from death , her internal organs were beginning to fail			1
eight layers of her skin had peeled off , her hands had swollen , she had lost 50 per cent of her hair and all her nails had fallen off			1
doctors placed the 27 - year - old in a medically induced coma as her body battled the bacteria invading her bloodstream			1
the condition caused her internal organs to begin shutting down , eight layers of skin to peel off and 50 per cent of her hair to fall out when she woke eight days later medics explained the @entity37 , which had been caused by a tampon , had caused ms @entity6 to suffer meningitis as well			1
looking at pictures of her daughters , @entity43 , eight , @entity44 , seven and three - year - old @entity45 , ms @entity6 drew a blank			1
but the mother - of - three has now overcome her ordeal , re-learning to walk after intense physiotherapy			2
she said : ' when i woke up from the coma i did n't know what was going on - i could n't remember anything			1
' someone had put pictures up of my children but i did n't know who they were			0
' people were pointing at the girls and asking me to name them , but i did n't know			0
' i knew i recognised them but i just could n't place them			0
' i was put in the coma on my 25th birthday so when i woke up i was surrounded by birthday cards			2
' a nurse was reading the cards out to me but i did n't know any of the names - i did n't even realise it had been my birthday			2
' all i really knew was that i was very poorly , and i thought i was going to die			0
' ms @entity6 first fell ill with what she thought was flu			1
but when she started struggling to breathe and drifted in and out of consciousness , her mother and partner , @entity72 , 28 , rushed her to hospital			0
they were told by medics the then 24 - year - old was just hours from death			1
when she woke after eight days in a coma , ms @entity6 was unable to recognise her three daughters @entity43 , eight , @entity44 , seven and three - year - old @entity45 , pictured with their mother , left toxic shock syndrome is a highly dangerous bacterial infection - but it can be misdiagnosed , because the symptoms are the same as other illnesses and because it is so rare			1
it occurs when usually harmless staphylococcus aureus or @entity92 bacteria , which live on the skin , invade the bloodstream and produce dangerous toxins			2
symptoms usually begin with a sudden high fever , with a temperature above @entity99			0
within a few hours a sufferer will develop flu - like symptoms including headache , muscle aches , a sore throat and cough			0
nausea and vomiting , diarrhoea , feeling faint , dizziness and confusion are also symptoms			0
a widespread sunburn - like rash can also appear , while the whites of the eyes , lips and tongue can appear more red than usual			0
after the rash appears , it is common for the skin to begin to shed in large sheets , especially from the hands and soles of the feet			0
women are most at risk of getting toxic shock syndrome during menstruation and particularly if they are using tampons , have recently given birth , or are using an internal barrier contraceptive such as a diaphragm			1
' the last thing i remember is being in the car racing towards the hospital , ' ms @entity6 said			1
' my internal organs were shutting down so i was put on life support , and put into a medically induced coma			1
' my hands had swollen , about eight layers of skin peeled of , i lost about 50 per cent of my hair , and all my nails fell off - i must have looked horrendous			1
' eight days later , when she woke from her coma , ms @entity6 's memory was blank			1
doctors told her the @entity37 , which had been caused by a tampon , had caused her to suffer meningitis			1
she said : ' it 's very strange to wake up and not know who you are or where you are			0
' i tried to speak but by the time i 'd got to the end of a sentence i could n't remember why i 'd started it			0
' even now people will mention things to me - something i 've done , or somewhere i went - and i do n't know what they 're talking about			2
' i was so confused and disorientated - i even thought my brother was my boyfriend			0
' i ended up discharging myself because i felt so unsure of everything			0
' it was n't until two days later when i called the doctors for a follow up that they told me i had suffered from toxic shock syndrome along with meningococcal septicaemia			1
ms @entity6 's memory slowly began to return , and she had to relearn how to walk during intense physiotherapy appointments			1
pictured right , her eldest daughters @entity43 and @entity44 ' i just could n't believe it - i had n't done anything different from what i usually do every other month			1
' ms @entity6 's recovery has been a long and slow process			1
gradually her memory started to return , but today she still struggles to recall some parts of her past			0
she said : ' even now there are big gaps in my memory			0
' i do n't remember @entity45 's first steps , or a lot of her milestones such as talking and weaning			2
' it makes me sad as they are big parts of her life that i now feel like i 've missed out on			0
' i can look through photo albums and see pictures of holidays that i have no idea even happened			0
' it 's very weird to think that i 've had all these experiences that i ca n't remember			2
' she added : ' getting over everything was very difficult , and it 's taken about two years altogether			0
' my @entity196 had to move in with me to look after me as i could n't look after myself			0
' i had to have intense physio as i had to learn to walk again , and it took ages for my hair to grow back			2
' it 's been a really traumatic experience and i know there are parts of me that will never be the same again			0
' but i 'm just relieved that i made it through and my girls have still got their mum - i count myself very lucky			2

@entity6 woke from a coma unable to recognise her family
she had suffered toxic shock syndrome caused by a tampon
27 - year - old was placed on life support as her body fought off the poison
@entity37 is rare but life - *threatening* and caused when bacteria invades the body
ms @entity6 's internal organs began shutting down , eight layers of skin peeled off and she lost 50 *%* of her hair and all her nails
she has made a full recovery , having relearned how to walk
' i just could n't believe it , ' she said . ' i had n't done anything different from what i usually do every other month '
