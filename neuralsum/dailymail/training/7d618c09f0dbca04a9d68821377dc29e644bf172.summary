a mother has spoken of her distress at being told to lose weight for more than a decade before doctors realised her ballooning legs were the result of a genuine medical condition			1
@entity7 , now 38 , first visited her gp at age 16 after noticing her legs had got so big it looked as though there was an elastic band around her ankle			1
for the next seven years she went back and forth to the doctor but was told she had big legs because she was overweight			1
she was repeatedly told she was overweight and to go on a diet at the age of 32 , ms @entity7 was eventually diagnosed with lipoedema , a condition which causes the legs to become enlarged			1
as the condition is incurable , her legs have now ballooned to 10 - stone curiously , she noticed that when she went on a diet she could shed fat from her torso but her legs just kept on growing , she told @entity32 's @entity31			1
it was by sheer chance that aged 32 , she was diagnosed with lipoedema – a condition which causes the legs , thighs , buttocks and arms to become enlarged			1
as the condition in incurable , her legs have now grown to 10 stone , leaving her in constant pain , having and unable to walk normally or play with her six - year - old son , @entity42			1
her only hope is a new type of liposuction treatment being trialled , which she hopes will become available on the @entity46 soon			1
she told presenters @entity47 and @entity49 : ' i was 16 when i noticed i had an elastic band effect around the bottom of each leg			1
‘ i went to my gp who looked at them and said i had water retention and to go away and try some dieting , which i did			0
‘ i lost loads of weight off my torso but not off my legs			1
’ she went back and forth to the doctor for years , with her legs growing at an alarming rate , but each time she was told to keep on with her diet			1
@entity67 is the abnormal build - up of fat cells in the legs , thighs and buttocks			1
it causes the legs to become enlarged from the hips to the ankles but the feet are unaffected			1
the fat often creates a ring of fatty tissue overlapping the top the feet			2
the skin often feels cold and bruises easily			0
it can be very painful and can cause pain in the knees			2
@entity67 occurs almost exclusively in women and tends to start during puberty or pregnancy			0
the accumulation of fat tends to be worse in people who are obese but also affects people who are a healthy weight and dieting does not help			2
the cause of the condition in unknown but there is often a family history in patients			2
the only treatment known to work is called tumescent liposuction but this is not currently available on the @entity46			1
it involves numbing the legs before removing the excess fat			1
this treatment has been shown to be highly effective and has good long - term results			2
source : @entity110 being told repeatedly that she was fat caused her to become demoralised and lose hope			1
‘ i gave up in the end , ' she said			2
' i was told i was fat all the time , ’ she believes it was only by sheer luck that she ever got a diagnosis			2
six years ago , she was referred to a dermatologist about some eczema on the back of her legs			2
‘ as soon as i got my legs out for him to have a look at the eczema , he recognised straight away what was wrong with my them , ' she recalled			0
ms @entity7 was instantly diagnosed with lipoedema , which some studies say affects as many as 11 per cent of women			1
those with the condition have an excess number of fat cells in affected areas , as well as a build - up of fluid in those cells			2
the affected areas tend to feel softer and more doughy than normal fat , and may be tender to the touch , feel painful and bruise easily			0
it is not clear what causes it , though as it runs run in families , it is thought there is a genetic link			0
doctors also believe there could be a hormonal trigger , as it often manifests itself after puberty or pregnancy			0
as ms @entity7 ’s legs grew , they became more painful and began to seriously limit her life			1
‘ they ’re painful every second of the day , ’ she said			0
ms @entity7 says her condition leaves her in constant pain and with difficulty walking			1
she says it knocks her confidence as she feels people judge her harshly , believing she is ' just another overweight person ' from the minute i get up , to the minute i go to bed , i ’m in pain			2
i ’m even in pain in my sleep			0
’ ‘ i ’ve got a young boy who ’s six years old			2
i have n’t been able to do things that mums do and get on the floor and play			0
‘ i ca n’t run around in a park with him , i ca n’t get on a bike			0
’ she is judged harshly because she is so overweight , and people do n’t realise she has a medical condition , she added			2
she said : ‘ it knocks your confidence loads , because of your appearance			0
‘ the majority of people look at you and think you ’re and overweight person			0
that ’s even @entity189 , because they ’re not educated about it			0
’ previously , @entity67 was treated using massage and compression stockings , but a type of liposuction which targets fatty tissues in the legs is being trialled			1
ms @entity7 told @entity32 's @entity31 presenters @entity49 ( far left ) and @entity47 ( left ) that she ' gave up ' after 10 years of doctors telling her she was fat ms @entity7 is hoping she will be eligible for the treatment , but will need to lose as much of her ‘ normal ’ fat first , a task which is hard given her condition makes walking difficult			1
the treatment would dramatically change her life , she said			0
‘ it would be absolutely amazing not to wake up in pain every day			0
that ’s the worst thing , ' she said			0
‘ then the second thing is the mobility , being able to walk properly			0
‘ because having lipoedema gives you a funny gait , when you walk			0
so i ’d love to be able to move around			0
’ while she feels guilty at not being able to play with him as other mothers might , ms @entity7 is grateful to her son @entity42 for being so patient and understanding about her condition			1
‘ my son @entity42 is great because he ’s grown up with it			0
he ’s so accepting of it , ’ she said			0
' he ’s so good , he knows i ca n’t do a lot of things			0

@entity7 , 38 , noticed her legs were growing faster than her body
doctors said she was overweight and told her to go on a diet
she was able to lose fat from her torso but her legs kept growing
after 10 years of being told she was fat by doctors , she ' gave up '
then by chance she was diagnosed with lipoedema at age 32
incurable condition makes legs , buttocks and thighs become enlarged
ms @entity7 ’s legs leave her in constant pain and with difficulty walking
hopes new liposuction treatment being trialled will become available on @entity46
