the issue of spitting , sadly , has emerged again this week with @entity2 and @entity3 both being condemned			1
as usual , there have been a number of people who have said ' it is the worst thing that can happen on a pitch ' ; it is vile but let me assure you now â€“ i would have preferred @entity12 to have spat at me the day he broke my leg in september 2003 ! i was spat at once in my career			0
it came during a @entity19 game against @entity20 in 1998 and the player in question was a @entity23 midfielder called @entity24			0
i was shocked more than angry when he did it because i could n't believe what had happened			0
the issue of spiting in football has , sadly , raised its head again after @entity2 and @entity3 clashed @entity2 appears to launch spit in the direction of the @entity33 striker , who then retaliates the only time @entity35 was spat on was in a @entity19 game against @entity20 in 1998 @entity39 is getting results , it 's time for everyone to get off the @entity44 manager 's back ... click here to read on			1
@entity3 has admitted being in the wrong and hit with a seven - game ban			1
i know it is a disgusting thing to do but i do think that punishment seems a little excessive , particularly if you compare it to an over-the - top tackle that would ' only ' get three games			1
for @entity2 , the incident does n't look good at all			2
it would have been easy enough for him to spit well away from @entity3			2
one final thing : all those people who have said about @entity2 ' he 's not that type of lad '			2
who is then ? is there are a list somewhere of names who are ' that type ' ? it is a stupid thing to say			0
it 's not about his character			0
it 's about whether he had a moment of madness , deliberately or not			0
@entity77 defender @entity12 is sent off after breaking @entity35 's leg in september 2003 @entity3 has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the @entity81 on thursday @entity2 decided to fight the charge brought against him , the @entity81 will announce their verdict on saturday			1
