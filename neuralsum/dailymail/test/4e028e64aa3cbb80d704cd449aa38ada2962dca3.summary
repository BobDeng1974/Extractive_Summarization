a greedy mother who told a 13 - year - old volunteer to ' f * * * off ' was evicted from a family easter egg hunt after she took more than her fair share of chocolate treats			1
the woman in her mid- to late 30s , who is believed to have had two or three children participating , was at @entity11 ’s @entity10 , which was run by @entity13 's @entity12 at @entity14 on saturday			1
she was escorted out of the racecourse , in @entity11 's south - east , when she became ' irate ' after a young volunteer at the hunt asked her to stop taking so many @entity19 eggs			1
the aim of the hunt is to raise awareness of organ and tissue donation , while raising money for @entity13 's @entity12			1
more than 2,500 chocolate lovers paid $ 5 to fill up their bucket with as many eggs as they could fit on saturday			0
' this is the fourth year we 've done the event and we have problems with parents sneaking in shopping bags and filling them up to the top , ' mr @entity25 told @entity49			0
she was told by a 13 - year - old volunteer she was taking too many eggs and she told the young person to ' f * * * off ' the woman kept denying she was smuggling eggs into additional plastic bags she had brought in ' parents are the toughest ones to control			1
you expect the kids to go frantic and shove eggs into their pockets and shirts and pants			0
but when parents go past this level of gluttony , it ’s not a good look			0
' mr @entity25 said they had to create a pram parking area outside the hunting spot to stop adults from smuggling eggs out by hiding them inside baby carriages			0
but he said this was the first year he had security guards escort a parent off site because they were taking too many of the 250,000 eggs donated by @entity82 's chocolates			2
he said one of volunteers approached him on the day and told him a woman was throwing obscenities at her when they asked her to stop stuffing multiple bags full with treats			0
' [ the woman ] was saying " i 've not done it " ... [ but ] she had definitely filled up a number of bags to the hilt , more than people paying $ 5 a bucket , ' mr @entity25 said			0
' she got irate and started carrying on and started having a go at my young volunteer who was only 13 years old			0
' she was using the f - word , saying " you ca n't stop from f * * * ing doing this and f * * * off "			2
' it was not the first time parents took more than their fair share - which is a $ 5 bucket full - but this is the first time organisers have had to kick someone out the egg hunt looks to raise money for @entity13 's @entity12 , which helps bring awareness of tissue and organ donation to the forefront it was started by @entity120 's father , @entity119 , who wanted to honour his seven - year - old daughter who was an organ donor when she died mr @entity25 said it was a shame this woman had acted in this way as she was at a family event , which he had started in the honour of his daughter , @entity13 , who died of a brain anuerysm when she seven years old			1
he said @entity13 's @entity12 tried to raise awareness of organ and tissue donation			1
at the time of her death , mr @entity25 said @entity13 was one of the youngest people in @entity137 to be on the donor list , saving the lives of up to seven people			0
@entity13 ( not pictured ) died of a brain aneurysm in 2004 and she has been remembered through the hunt mr @entity25 said parents were often the most difficult to control at these hunts as they were scrambling to get as many eggs as possible organisers have had to stop parents bringing prams because they were using them to smuggle out eggs ' we try to [ do events ] left of field for organ and tissue donation , ' he said			1
' we 've had jockey breeches with rainbow stripes on the side , we 've done that for a number of years where [ jockeys ] wear them at race events and we came up with the idea of @entity11 's @entity162			2
' it 's @entity11 ’s biggest @entity164 and it raises much needed funds in an area where there are benefits for young and old			2

@entity170 was at charity @entity164 at @entity11 's @entity14
a volunteer at the event on saturday told her to stop taking too many eggs
she told the 13 - year - old to ' f * * * off ' and *continued* to deny she was doing it
but she became so rowdy security guards had to throw her out of the hunt
the @entity19 event was held to raise money for @entity13 's @entity12
*foundation* aims to make people more aware of organ and tissue donation
