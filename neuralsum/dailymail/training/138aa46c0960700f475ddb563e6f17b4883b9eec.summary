this was a wedding @entity2 will remember for years — however much it might want to forget it			2
the theme was pure @entity5 , with four white - plumed @entity7 horses pulling a carriage containing the loving couple , who were separated by a mere 57 years			2
as guests gathered last weekend in the 1,441 - room @entity14 for the lavish reception , the bride and groom released two symbolic white doves into the air			2
the 24 - year - old bride , former @entity18 , wore an explosion of purple and white chiffon over a jewelled strapless bustier , topped off with a white fur jacket			2
to be fair , he always looks like that , having had plastic surgery on his eyelids in an attempt to look like @entity39			2
‘ apart from a big age difference , everything fits , ’ he said of his fifth marriage			2
but aside from the glorious eccentricity of his latest nuptials , the union throws up a tantalising question : will the new mrs @entity48 put a stop to the oddest and tackiest date in the international showbusiness calendar ? every year , her new husband — nicknamed ‘ concrete ’ due to his roots in the building trade — famously bribes a glamorous and usually busty female celebrity to be his companion at the glittering @entity59			1
if spending an evening being whirled around the dance floor by a doddery octogenarian with virtually no @entity63 , or sipping champagne with him in his private box , does n’t sound seductive enough , the trip also includes an obligatory tour of his local shopping mall , @entity69			2
how could any girl say no ? expensive date : @entity72 was reportedly paid $ 110,000 to attend the ball as his date in 1995 close - up : the eccentric @entity48 , pictured with @entity77 in 2001 , has starred in his own tv reality show more shocking than his gall in trying to buttonhole the cream of @entity84 pulchritude is the fact that so many stars have actually said yes			1
and big names to boot			2
since the cheesy tradition started in 1991 with the voluptuous @entity91 actress @entity90 , she was followed during the nineties by @entity93 , @entity72 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and even @entity97 , @entity98			1
host with the most : billionaire @entity26 with @entity99 at the glittering @entity59 the following decade saw @entity100 , @entity77 , @entity101 , @entity102 and former spice girl @entity99 take the @entity30 ’s not ungenerous schillings			1
snooty @entity2 society has attacked mr @entity26 as a flashy , publicity - obsessed parvenu who has brought @entity30 ’s most prestigious social event into disrepute			1
there have been calls for the ‘ ageing horny builder ’ , as one outraged grandee called him , to lose his box at the ball			2
however , the eccentric @entity48 — who has starred in his own tv reality show , formed his own political party and has gone to other balls in drag — is not at all daunted			1
neither are the stars who continue to accept his invitations — and his money			0
over the years , the celebrity guests themselves have had little to say about their date with @entity48 — but you can understand their reticence to discuss such shamelessly mercenary behaviour			1
a seasoned ball observer yesterday compared it with the @entity133 @entity84 stars who sneak off to @entity134 to appear in tacky @entity136 commercials for which they are paid fortunes — knowing they will never be seen in the @entity138 of course , some of these world - famous women may be curious to attend the world ’s most famous ball , held amid the splendour of chandeliers , gilded ceilings and marble statues in @entity2 ’s @entity148			2
but the chief draw is invariably financial			0
@entity48 pays a five or six - figure sum to his guest , as well as flying her and a few hangers - on to and from @entity2 by private jet , and putting her up at a suite in one of the city ’s most luxurious hotels			1
this year , the fee reportedly rose as high as $ 500,000 when he paid reality tv phenomenon @entity27 to attend — albeit with disastrous results , more of which later			2
but in celebrity - starved @entity30 , @entity48 strives to get his money ’s worth by agreeing a contract which outlines his guest ’s obligations to him			1
' a great dancer ' : mr @entity26 said that he loves it when his guests are gracious enough to dance with him			1
above , the billionaire with actress @entity96 , who was his date to the event in 1999 they must accompany him to a pre-ball press conference and spend a few hours signing autographs in his shopping mall , @entity69			1
joining him on the dance floor for the @entity182 is not obligatory , although mr @entity183 makes it plain it would be appreciated			0
many stars , it seems , do n’t play ball , doing the bare minimum contractually before they can flee back to @entity189 , @entity190 or @entity191			0
@entity192 of @entity190 , @entity48 ’s guest in 1997 for a reported $ 40,000 ( a bargain compared to the $ 110,000 he reportedly paid for @entity72 two years earlier ) , did at least speak to the media at the ball			1
‘ it is wonderful to see all the men in their finery with their white ties on and listen to the excellent music , ’ she told @entity30 tv blandly			1
open : @entity192 of @entity190 , @entity48 ’s guest in 1997 for a reported $ 40,000 , did at least speak to the media of course , she had debts to pay off at the time and a book to promote			1
still , to sweeten the deal , @entity48 paid for a three - room suite at @entity2 ’s lavish @entity211 ( where @entity212 used to stay ) and two stretch limos to ferry her around			1
of course , even when you ’re showering money on stars you have to be prepared for prima donna behaviour			0
in 1993 , @entity93 reportedly demanded an @entity138 limousine and wanted special pencils for her autograph - signing session			0
she stipulated that she would n’t be asked to sign any books that had been written by her sister , @entity222 , and also asked for a wraparound table to hide her legs			0
" a real - life beast " : in 1993 , @entity93 reportedly demanded an @entity138 limousine and a specific table @entity48 refused to comment on reports he had paid the actress £ 57,000			1
‘ i never talk about money , ’ he said			0
‘ it is n’t nice for miss @entity93 to read what she is getting			0
’ when @entity235 backed out of @entity48 ’s invitation to attend the 1996 ball , he recruited @entity238 singer @entity95 at the last minute			1
she insisted on bringing along her boyfriend , and poor mr @entity26 did n’t get a look - in			1
‘ he makes too much love , this boyfriend , and @entity95 spends a lot of time with him , ’ he griped later			0
‘ they make love also in the @entity248 behind the curtains			0
i mean , we did n’t see			0
’ he brought @entity238 singer @entity95 with him to the ball in 1996 @entity48 rarely criticises his companions , but occasionally feels moved to speak out			1
@entity99 , who graced the ball in 2005 , was a nightmare , he claimed			0
‘ @entity99 was the most difficult			0
she even refused to do interviews , ’ he said two years ago			0
' @entity93 is a real - life beast , not just on tv			0
@entity95 had sex — before the ball , during the ball and after the ball ! ’ @entity263 actress @entity262 — ex-wife of @entity264 — was the ‘ nicest ’ guest he had ever had			2
he also loves it when his guests are gracious enough to dance with him			0
@entity96 and @entity95 were ‘ great dancers ’ , he recalled			1
standout : @entity263 actress @entity262 — ex-wife of @entity264 — was the ‘ nicest ’ guest he had ever had other guests have complained of being treated like pieces of meat at the ball			2
@entity274 , the burlesque dancer who accompanied him in 2008 , complained that she was ‘ trampled in a mob scene by @entity277 ’ , which was ‘ very frightening ’			0
it ’s fair to say @entity48 is n’t the dish he may once have been			1
there have been unkind sneers about the declining calibre of stars he takes to the ball nowadays			0
he also seems to be paying a lot more than he used to			0
but even trainwreck actress @entity289 did n’t manage to honour her reported $ 150,000 deal to attend in 2010			2
after missing the jet he ’d laid on , she refused to take a scheduled flight or even share another private flight , and did n’t go			1
the following year , he withdrew his invitation to actress @entity297 after claiming she ’d demanded $ 25,000 more than agreed			0
@entity48 boasted he had 20 other candidates			1
given he opted for @entity302 , the teenage dancer accused of being paid for sex by @entity304 , one can only wonder what the rest were like			0
after this year , those who say he is ruining the ball ’s reputation have even more ammunition			0
after paying @entity27 a small fortune to attend , mr @entity26 complained that she was ‘ annoying ’			1
she was ‘ refusing to stick with the programme ’ by going off to film her reality tv show at a local restaurant instead of being with him			0
she even refused to dance with the old boy after he ’d announced at a press conference that she would			0
instead , she offered her mother as a dancing partner			0
the @entity27 camp told a different tale , saying @entity27 had fled the ball after being approached by a ‘ blacked - up ’ white man mimicking her now - husband , rapper @entity329			0
it was also claimed that @entity27 felt @entity48 was overly tactile , and asked her to dismiss her minders so they could be alone			1
perhaps , given such controversy , the fact that he is newly married might bring this eccentric annual tradition to an end — or perhaps there are some female celebrities left who still think an invitation from mr @entity183 is just too good to turn down .			1
