a routine jungle trek turned into tragedy when an elephant killed his handler and ran off with two tourists in south - west @entity6			1

@entity16 was discovered nearly two miles away from the resort in @entity18 , 310miles south of @entity19 , and had to be tranquilized so the woman and her daughter could climb off			1
the jungle trek is a common activity offered to tourists visiting southern @entity6 , and it is not yet known what brought on @entity16 ’s outburst			2
@entity16 , and 18 - year - old bull elephant , suddenly threw off mr @entity31 , trampled him , and ran off with the tourists during a standard trek on sunday			1
rescuers followed the elephant into the jungle and was able to locate him 30 minutes later			0
another handler was able to jump onto @entity16 ’s neck by climbing up a nearby slope , but it still took several tranquilizer darts before the elephant was calm enough for the woman and her daughter to get off safely , @entity42 reports			0
it is thought that @entity16 was in musth , a periodic change in bull behaviour related to an elated level in testosterone , which takes place in the winter months			0
@entity16 was discovered nearly two miles away from the resort in @entity18 , 310miles south of @entity19 , and had to be tranquilized so the woman and her daughter could climb off during this time even the most calm and peaceful bull becomes highly aggressive , and produces 40 to 60 times more testosterone than during non-musth			2
although musth is caused by the male elephant 's hormones , it is not connected to female elephants being in heat , and the reason for musth is a topic of debate among elephant experts			0
it is believed to be a way of marking territory , but it is also argued that musth is a way for weaker male elephants in a heard to mate with the females , rather than just the strongest bull , thus preventing inbreeding .			0
