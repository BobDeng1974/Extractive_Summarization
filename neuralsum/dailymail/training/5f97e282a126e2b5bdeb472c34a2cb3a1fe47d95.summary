this finding came from @entity9 - based research group @entity8 ( @entity8 ) after it conducted on - the - ground investigations in @entity11 and @entity12			1
it ’s been known for a while that @entity0 has been using @entity6 military hardware , but @entity8 ’s study is the first by a non-government body to try and document in detail what hardware the terrorist group , also known as the @entity22 ( @entity23 ) , is deploying			1

’ the @entity49 ( @entity50 ) and the @entity51 in @entity11 habitually use recovered @entity0 weaponry to supplement their firepower , but @entity8 said it documented @entity6 weapons just two days after their capture , so they could be easily differentiated			1
small arms being used by @entity0 include @entity37 assault rifles and @entity59 semi-automatic rifles			1
@entity8 also noted that @entity0 appears to have a very well - organised supply system as weapons had been transferred with speed across large distances			2

‘ the distance between the two regions is roughly 500 km. the speed of transfer to @entity65 demonstrates the logistical competence of @entity23 forces and the strategic importance of @entity65 to the group			0

car director @entity104 told @entity105 : ‘ excluding activities by state intelligence services , of which we know little and are not in the public domain , this is the first time anyone has sent a field investigation team to document captured @entity23 weapons			0
