mouthwatering photos of school lunches served around the world reveal even children in @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 are treated to delectable meals each day			1
school children in @entity9 , meanwhile , are n't nearly so lucky			1

the contrasts between @entity9 's school meals and those in far less fortunate economies are stark and suggest @entity28 's push for more healthful lunches nationwide may not be enough			1
what is it ? school lunches in the @entity33 stand in stark contrast to the wholesome and in some cases even decadent meals served to kids in other markedly less fortunate nations the first new school lunch standards championed by @entity28 have been phased in over the last several school years			1
in addition to whole grain requirements , the rules set fat , calorie , sugar and sodium limits on foods in the lunch line and beyond			0
while many schools have had success putting the rules in place , others have said they are too restrictive and costly			0
backlash against the rules have spawned a wave of social media photos along with the tag # @entity60			0
if these pictures are any indication , schools have responded to the rules by cutting down on portions to reduce fat and calories rather than by using potentially more costly ingredients			0

the surprising pictures show just how the @entity82 and @entity33 measures up to the rest of the world when it comes to feeding schoolchildren			0
while the majority of lunches feature fresh foods , @entity33 tray is packed with processed items			1
