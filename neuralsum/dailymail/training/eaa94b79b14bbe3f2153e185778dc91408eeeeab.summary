by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity4 's @entity3 team have hit back at @entity6 president @entity5 after he criticised their selection of the rider for the @entity9			1
@entity3 published an open letter to @entity5 criticising comments he made after the @entity13 rider was provisionally suspended based on biological passport irregularities			0
@entity4 was omitted from @entity3 's @entity16 squad and , his team say , was not suspended , by them or the @entity6 , until he was selected for this month 's @entity9			1
the letter from @entity3 managing director read @entity20 followed a series of messages from team owner @entity23 on @entity24 , threatening legal action against the @entity6 , although many of the @entity28 's comments on the social networking site should be taken with a pinch of salt			2
the team do , however , take issue with comments made by @entity5 in an interview with cyclingnews.com , when the @entity37 criticised @entity4 's selection for the @entity9			2
@entity6 president : @entity5 criticised @entity41 's selection of @entity4 for the @entity9 suspended : cyclist @entity4 was supposed to take part in the @entity3 's @entity9 the letter read : ' what seems inexplicable to us is how @entity6 can decide that from a certain moment in time but also retroactively the interpretation of the rule , that riders will not be provisionally suspended for alleged blood passport violations , which has applied since 2011 when the blood passport was introduced , shall be revised			1
what changed on august 1st , 2014 ? ' it seems to us that ( a ) a penalty to a rider shall be applied only based on very precise and verified circumstances ( b ) @entity6 and yourself ( @entity60 ) have written that the provisional suspension is imposed because it is likely that the rider 's results will be affected by the asserted anti-doping rule violation - thus you believe he is guilty ; and ( c ) we believe that justice shall be administered treating all cases in the same manner and not on a case by case basis			0
' the open letter concluded : ' this team is fully committed to the fight against doping in sport , to the use of the biological passport and to the application of strict anti-doping rules but does believe this should be conducted in a manner that respects the facts and proper process , guarantees proper defence right and do not jeopardise the team 's ability to plan properly when hiring riders and select a team to participate in a race			0
' king of the mountains : @entity3 's @entity93 won the polka - dot jersey at the @entity95 out : but team - mate @entity96 , who has himself been banned for doping , crashed out early in the tour			0

@entity4 was omitted from @entity101 team
@entity41 say he was never suspended by them or @entity6
rider was selected for @entity9 , then banned *retrospectively* by @entity6
@entity13 cyclist given suspension only *48* hours before @entity9 started
@entity23 threatened @entity6 with legal action
