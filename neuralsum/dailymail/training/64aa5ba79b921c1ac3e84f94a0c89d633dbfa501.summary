by @entity0 @entity1 is set to pack his things and head to @entity3 , but one thing should remain clear : @entity5 did not make the midfielder the player he is today			1
while @entity1 no doubt established himself as a prominent @entity10 player under @entity11 , the @entity13 ’s influence was nothing compared to that of the man who coached @entity1 before and after him : @entity17			1
it was under @entity17 that he first played regular @entity20 football			2
it was under @entity17 that he finally became a crucial figure for @entity10 and the national team			1
@entity24 - bound : @entity1 ( right ) holds off @entity24 's @entity25 in the @entity26 @entity1 joined @entity10 as a 16 - year - old from @entity29 club @entity28 in 2006			1
by @entity30 2008 , he was still yet to prove himself as a first - team player , and then @entity10 coach @entity32 let him out on loan to @entity34			1
there , he had his first taste of working under @entity17			2
despite injuries hindering him in the early months , @entity1 soon began to shine at @entity34			1
under @entity17 , he could fulfil the two roles for which he is now famous : the space - creating no 10 with the vicious shot , and the game controlling no 6 with an astute tactical awareness			2
upon his return to @entity10 in the summer of 2010 , @entity1 did thrive under @entity11 , and impressed hugely before @entity30 , at a time when @entity10 had an injury crisis in attacking midfield			1
by the time @entity11 left @entity10 in the usual storm of tears and internal politics , @entity1 was a well - established figure at the @entity51 , though questions remained over his role in the team			1
then , @entity17 turned up again , this time as @entity10 coach			1
@entity1 greeted his arrival by saying : ' he is the coach in professional football who has always given me his constant trust and support			2
it ’s a stroke of luck for me that he ’s coming '			0
champion : @entity1 ( second right ) celebrates winning the @entity20 title by lifting the shield with team - mates the boss : @entity5 ( centre ) - taking @entity72 training - was @entity1 ' manager when he was at @entity10 it was in the following two seasons , from 2011 to 2013 , that @entity1 really became a force			1
it was in those seasons where he became recognisable across @entity78 , both on club and international level			0
with fame and responsibility , of course , comes sharper criticism			0
though few doubt his talent , many have accused @entity1 of being a lazy player in the last few years			2
that is an impression shaped largely by memories of his poor performance against @entity93 at @entity94			0
@entity1 ’ sluggishness on that day has haunted him since but in truth he rarely tears around			0
he may not sprint around the place like @entity99 but his positioning and his ability to create space are beyond doubt			0
those are skills which @entity105 brought out of him			0
top talent : @entity1 ( left ) celebrates winning the @entity107 with @entity108 ( centre ) and @entity110 the teacher : @entity17 is the manager who brought out the best in @entity1 ' game at @entity34 and @entity10 of all the players of the @entity11 era linked with @entity24 so far , it 's no surprise that @entity1 has secured a move to @entity24			1
@entity118 may have a stronger relationship with the new @entity24 coach , but he , like @entity121 , is also @entity10 through and through			1
the two players eat , drink and sleep @entity10			0
@entity1 , on the other hand , is an @entity29 , a one - time @entity125 fan , and a pragmatist			0
he has worked under @entity11 successfully before , and knows he can fit into the @entity13 ’s system			0
but the move will be about money , and @entity1 wanting a new experience			2
not sentimentality for the man who brought him stardom			0
the man who did that is not manager of @entity24			0
he ’s enjoying a well earned semi-retirement .			0

@entity1 has agreed *£* *20million* summer move from @entity10 to @entity24
the move will see @entity141 *reunited* with former @entity10 boss @entity5
another former @entity10 boss @entity17 responsible for *honing* @entity1 ' game at @entity34 and @entity10
