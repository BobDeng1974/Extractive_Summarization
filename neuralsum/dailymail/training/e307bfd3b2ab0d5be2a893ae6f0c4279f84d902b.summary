by @entity0 published : 17:10 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 17:47 est , 17 july 2013 @entity2 bought his first car in 1972 - a lime green @entity4 that was his pride and joy			2
now , 24 years after giving it up , @entity2 's son has reunited him with his first love			1
it 's not known what the circumstances were surrounding @entity2 's parting with the vehicle - perhaps his growing family forced him to sell the @entity16 for a more practical model			2
over the years , @entity2 talked about finding the car , even seeing it once in @entity20 , @entity21 back in 1999 , but recently he redoubled his efforts to locate it			1
glory days : the @entity16 in the years before @entity2 had to give it up all the while , his son was also secretly on the lookout for the @entity16 , and in april this year , he found it in @entity30			1
after convincing the current owner to sell it to him , he drove the car back to its rightful owner at his home in @entity37			1
family members , in on the surprise , filmed the moments when @entity2 realizes his beloved first car is sitting in his front yard			2
courtesy of the @entity44 @entity45 : @entity2 's concern quickly gives way to happiness when he sees his mustang in the front yard father - son bonding : @entity2 's son greets his dad after driving the @entity16 from @entity30 to @entity37 the family gathers around a window facing the front yard of the house in @entity57 , @entity37			1
' @entity58 ' exclaims someone			0
' @entity60 , what is that ? ' asks @entity2 's daughter			0
' what ? ' says @entity2 , looking alarmed			0
' what 's the matter ? ! ' his alarm turns into a huge smile when he sees ( and hears ) what 's in the garden			0
@entity2 runs out to the front yard and he and his son embrace			2
unchanged : after 24 years , nothing had been done to the body of the car two great loves : lookebill with his first car and his wife ' paying you back , buddy , ' says the son to his father			1
@entity2 approaches the car looking awestruck , opens the door and rubs the paintwork			2
' can you believe it ? ' asks his son			0
' no ! ' comes the response			0
@entity2 and his wife hug in front of the car 's open door - perhaps where they had their first kiss			0
the father rubs his eyes beneath his glasses and looks at the camera , shaking his head in disbelief			0
emotional : @entity2 was briefly overcome @entity102 : @entity2 and his wife speed off into the sunset then , 24 years after losing it , @entity2 gets into his car with his wife in the passenger seat			1
@entity2 pulls out of the drive and then revs the engine , clearly having lost none of his boy racer enthusiasm over the intervening 24 years			1
and the car sounds just as pleased to be back with its owner .			0
