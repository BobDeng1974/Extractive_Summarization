by @entity0 @entity1 , 14 , had a pioneering and live - saving heart operation last month after a major vessel collapsed a teenage boy with a rare condition which caused his heart to be twice the normal size has undergone a pioneering world first operation to save his life			1
@entity1 , 14 , went under the knife for ground - breaking keyhole surgery to insert a stent into his heart at the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17			1
doctors decided to perform the procedure on the youngster after a major blood vessel between his heart and lungs completely collapsed			1
a team of 20 experts faced a race against time as they battled to save @entity1 during the five - hour procedure which had never been tried before			1
medics inserted a stent into his heart and then used a new valve - taken from the jugular of a @entity35 cow - to repair his pulmonary artery			1
@entity1 has suffered from the rare genetic condition @entity38 for his entire life			1
the condition resulted in the teen suffering four different heart defects at the same time			2
but thanks to the pioneering operation , the cricket - mad teenager is now back at the crease and enjoying his new lease of life			1
he said : ‘ i felt that even if it was n't successful then at least it would benefit other people and i 'm glad they can now receive the same treatment			0
‘ it 's great to be back on the cricket pitch again			0
‘ before the operation i had to take regular breaks before stopping playing altogether			0
’ his father , @entity57 , 48 , a small business owner , added : ‘ the operation was a world 's first , it was amazing what they could do			0
‘ he was under the knife for five hours , during which they put in a stent and a new valve			2
‘ the stent went into his pulmonary artery			1
normally if this kind of treatment is required it is because the artery is blocked due to lack of exercise or bad diet			2
‘ they would then just be opening the artery , but the reason that @entity1 's was blocked was that his coronary artery was pushing against it and forcing it into his breast plate			1
@entity1 ( pictured after surgery in 2005 ) was born with a complex heart defect and has had a series of open heart operations			1
the most recent one was required because a major vessel between his heart and lungs collapsed during the operation , surgeons inserted a stent into his heart and used a valve from a cow 's heart to repair his pulmonary artery			1
he is pictured with hie parents , @entity57 and @entity98 and his brother , @entity100 , 17 @entity1 needed surgery because a major blood vessel between his heart and lungs completely collapsed			1
this was causing him to become very breathless and was putting his life at risk			0
during the keyhole operation , surgeons inserted a stent into his pulmonary artery to keep it open			1
they then inserted a new valve which came from an @entity35 cow			1
they did not want to carry out another open heart operation for fear of the damage it would cause the muscle , so they had no choices but to perform keyhole surgery			2
they were so worried that he would suffer a heart attack on the operating table that they had a life support machine ready for him if he needed it			0
‘ so it is not just a blockage inside the artery , it is something forcing it closed from the outside			0
‘ his heart was having to work harder to pump the blood and so was growing much bigger than it should have done			2
‘ the doctors went in via a keyhole and inserted the stent into his pulmonary artery			1
‘ they then put a new valve inside the stent , which had created a fully open artery			1
‘ that valve came from the jugular of an @entity35 cow			2
they modified it to make it work with humans and then they inserted it into @entity1			1
‘ turns out you can not use a @entity151 or @entity152 cow because of @entity153 so they are flown from @entity154 or @entity35			0
‘ it has completely transformed @entity1 's life , in fact it has saved his life			2
‘ it 's so great now , he was told to stop exercising in winter and now just a few weeks after the op he is playing cricket , back at archery practice and today is playing tennis at school			0
since the operation , @entity1 ( pictured in hospital in 2005 ) says he is able to play sport again without becoming breathless and having to stop @entity1 had his first operation at just 10 months old and then had further surgery at six and 11 ( pictured ) ‘ now he should be able to live a full and normal life , although it 's all new ground now			1
’ tetralogy of fallot affects just five in 10,000 people and the abnormalities it brings can be fatal			0
@entity1 first underwent surgery for the condition when he was just 10 months old , before further surgeries at six and 11			2
each of those surgeries was only partly successful , leaving @entity1 facing another gruelling spell under the knife			2
he began to complain of breathlessness last autumn while exercising at school near his home in @entity184 , @entity185			0
after a series of mri scans medics concluded they had no choice but to operate and @entity1 went back under the knife on march 11			1
his mother , @entity98 , 47 , a teacher , added : ‘ we have had a lot of anxiety about it			0
‘ you lie awake at night thinking “ he has already had three operations , can he really have another ? ” ‘ but we are so happy and grateful for the work the doctors at @entity16 have done			0
@entity1 ( pictured in hospital in 2005 with his mother and brother ) hopes he will now not need and further surgery @entity1 's most recent operation was the first of its kind to be carried out			1
he is pictured in hospital in 2005 ‘ when they said he was completely better we almost did n't believe them - i do n't think it has sunk in yet			0
’ cardiologist dr @entity212 said the keyhole procedure had enabled her team to treat @entity1 's problem without damaging the heart muscle			1
it was the first time the procedure had been attempted without opening up the chest			0
dr @entity212 said : ‘ @entity1 is the first person in the world to have this type of procedure performed this way			2
‘ it was a team effort and we 're very pleased to hear how much of an improvement @entity1 has noticed since			2
‘ it became clear the blockage was due to muscle thickening which had n't been cut away as it contained one of the arteries supplying the heart muscle with oxygen			0
‘ doing a fourth open heart operation to deliberately cut away the muscle containing the blood vessel had a very high risk of death or heart muscle damage			1
’ tetralogy of @entity242 is a group of four structural abnormalities within the heart that occur together			0
these are : tetralogy of @entity242 is a congenital heart disease			0
babies with the condition will need surgery to correct their heart abnormalities			0
before surgery , they often appear blue and are prone to fainting			0
about 98 per cent of children with the condition survive and go on to have a good quality of life			0

@entity1 had a ground - breaking and live - saving operation in march
required as a major blood vessel between his heart and lungs collapsed
surgeons inserted a stent into his heart and used a new heart valve - from a cow - to repair his pulmonary artery and he is now *healthy*
