sadly that 's not the case here			0

he was also convicted of two mortgage frauds			0
he denied the allegations but was found guilty after a six - week trial , and sentenced yesterday			1

prison : @entity3 was jailed for 18 months at @entity14 's @entity13 for the offences @entity92 , defending , told the court : ' he 's going to suffer because of this conviction , because his standing as a man in the community , which he has worked so hard for , has been shattered and he 's going to have to live with that			2
' assistant chief @entity100 said : ' there is no doubt that the actions of inspector @entity3 have brought discredit to @entity24 and reflect badly on our officers and police staff who are honest and work tirelessly for the people of @entity14			1
' it us understood understood @entity3 , who is still a serving officer on suspension , will face an internal hearing with @entity24 on monday .			2
