by @entity0 @entity1 is to blame , in my opinion			1
until @entity6 and her cohort of fashion - obsessed , @entity10 - drinking @entity9 girlfriends burst on the scene at the end of the @entity13 , most of us had never even heard of a mani - pedi			1
my definition of grooming was a quick once - over with a razor and a session with @entity20 cream bleach			2
my best friend and i used to wander around our shared flat with our white moustaches , singing @entity23 into our hairbrushes in an exaggerated @entity26 voice			2
the idea of ' professional ' beauty treatments was alien to us - the sort of thing only the starriest of the starry had the time and money for			1
boudoir secrets : home treatments give you the freedom to be yourself there was a certain cachet in being low - maintenance , too			1
my generation defined itself as clever , not beautiful			2
i was considered positively daffy for having the occasional @entity44 facial ( still one of the best )			2
most girls my age did their hair and nails at home , not least because there were no such thing as blow - dry bars and @entity54 manicurists back then			1
now , of course , they are everywhere			2
even in times of economic hardship , women will still find a spare £ 5 for a file and polish			2
it ’s the 21st - century equivalent of the so - called lipstick effect : a little bit of luxury that goes a long way to lifting the spirits			2
if all this seems a little extravagant to my generation , my mother 's lot find it positively baffling			2
sixties and @entity72 beauties - @entity73 , @entity74 etc - kept their beauty regimes close to their chests			1
the boudoir was a place of privacy and secrets			2
the name of the game was diy			2
in fact , to this day @entity73 continues to dye her own hair blonde - and try as i might i can not get my own mother to give up her henna			1
in some ways , though , there has never been a better time to embrace @entity92 beauty			1
after the crash of 2008 , the beauty industry turned its attention to developing more cost - effective products for domestic use , with interesting results			1
last year , @entity99 launched the first ever re-usable permanent hair colour , @entity101 ( £ 10.99 from boots )			1
clever new packaging does all the donkey work for you , mixing the dye with the activator and delivering it in a light , non-drip mousse			1
unlike traditional home dyes , which have to be thrown out after use , you can keep this in the bathroom and use it to touch up roots			1
if you like to err on the natural side of things , @entity118 ( £ 9.99 from @entity119 ) is ammonia , resorcinol and paraben - free but still robust enough to cover greys			2
it comes in more than 30 shades , including some rich @entity125 - of - @entity127 - style browns			2
when we 're not fiddling with the hair on our heads , we are trying to get rid of the stuff on our bodies			1
i loathe salon waxing - what with the smell of the wax , the gruesomeness of the paper thong and having to make conversation with a total stranger in the most awkward of situations			1
i 'm not sure the perfect home solution has yet been invented			1
the closest i 've got is something along the lines of the @entity146 ( £ 29.99 , @entity102 )			0
you 'll never get a salon finish , but it will keep things tidy without too much fuss			0
for brows and facial hair , salon threading has been a revolution			1
but unless you know what you ’re doing , i would n't recommend trying to shape your own eyebrows			0
there is , though , a brilliant new way of removing unwanted facial hair at home : the @entity163 ( £ 10 , victoriahealth.com )			1
this canny little device consists of a metal spring and a rubber grip handle so you can just twist off excess hair from the root - like threading			1
it 's incredibly effective and simple to use , and will save you a fortune in waxing			1
thus , tweaked and trimmed , and in view of the slightly cheerier weather , you may want to consider adding a bit of a glow			0
salon - tanning is big business , but it is a lot easier ( and cheaper ) to do it at home			1
the choice of brand is entirely up to you ; but the secret to a successful , streak - free fake tan is the humble tanning mitt : @entity189 makes one of the best ( £ 5 , from @entity190 )			1
timeless : @entity192 has released a beauty range if you really want to know how to do good make - up , just ask a thespian			1
all actresses - famous or otherwise - do their own make - up			0
it does n't matter whether you 're the star of the show or a mere walk - on : you 're all backstage together , fixing your faces			0
strange , then , that there are n't more actresses in the beauty business			1
i suppose @entity207 had @entity208 , but i 'm not quite sure the term ' actress ' is the correct one to describe her talents			0
@entity212 had her own fragrance ; indeed @entity214 , which launched in 1991 , is still a bestseller			0
but apart from the occasional brand ambassadorship , few actresses have actually devised and endorsed their own make - up range			0
enter @entity192 , who yesterday made her @entity221 debut selling her new @entity222			0
given her age ( 80 ) and her appearance ( fabulous ) , it 's an appropriate name			0
i 've seen @entity226 up close , too , and the effect is really quite enchanting , especially her skin , which is amazing			0
crush ... @entity229 ( £ 18 ) if your skin has n’t yet got over winter , try a pot of this multi-purpose salve for some skin @entity235			0
fail ... @entity236 @entity236 , we love you			0
but you must promise that you will never again leave the house without wearing a bra			0
unlike many famous actresses of her generation , she has resisted the temptation to over-work her face in the manner of , say , poor @entity247 , who is virtually unrecognisable			0
@entity192 has aged well : she 's not trying to recapture or preserve in aspic her youthful beauty , but she does know how to make the most of what she still has : those eyes , the famous lips , the exquisite bone structure			1
the look of the range is very @entity192 : dark eyes and vivid lips : this collection is certainly not for wallflowers			0
each lipstick is named after a @entity226 character , from @entity263 , a hot pink named after her alter ego in @entity267 , to a rich burgundy courtesy of her other famous incarnation , the wicked @entity270 ( boo , hiss ) in @entity271			0
the quality , as you would expect , is classy , with plenty of gold casing reminiscent of old - school @entity207			0
the range itself , then , is very much in her image , i.e. results - based and designed to flatter			0
for me , the stand - out item is the @entity284 , which contains a soft , very fine powder and is cleverly designed to incorporate a lipstick in the lid			0
the eyeshadows are great , too : complimentary quads of colour so that you can vamp your look up or down according to preference			0
my only real criticism is that i would have called it simply ' @entity192 '			0
after all , when you 're a legend , surnames are superfluous .			0

there has never been a better time to embrace @entity92 beauty
