by @entity0 people from the north of @entity3 consider @entity4 to be chaotic , crowded and bad for @entity5 , according to a study released today			0
only 24 per cent of those living outside the capital think @entity4 has a positive impact on their local economy , with that figure even lower in northern cities such as @entity14 and @entity15 , where the number drops to just nine per cent and eight per cent respectively			1
while two thirds of the population agree @entity4 has a positive impact on the national economy , the same number argue that the capital unfairly benefits from central government being based there			1
divide : while two thirds of the population agree @entity4 benefits the national economy ( green figures ) , only 24 per cent of those living outside the capital think it has a positive impact at a local level ( red figures ) the figures come from a report for @entity35 and the @entity36 , with @entity37 questioning residents in 16 towns and cities across the @entity5			1
the study confirms the suspicion of a growing divide between @entity4 and the rest of the country - something that has long been suggested by the capital 's property bubble			0
the results point to something a ripple effect in opinion , with the towns and cities closest to @entity4 feeling most positive about the capital 's impact , and those further away feeling the least positive			2
this is magnified in parts of @entity59 , with just eight per cent of those living in @entity61 and @entity15 thinking @entity4 has a positive impact on their city			1
the results are not must better in @entity66 where the number is 13 per cent			0
unfair : only 24 per cent of non-londoners think the capital ( pictured ) has a positive impact on their local economy			1
meanwhile two thirds argue @entity4 unfairly benefits from central government being based there ignored : only 17 per cent of non-londoners think @entity78 politicians such as chancellor @entity79 ( left ) and prime minister @entity80 ( right ) are responsive to local issues it 's not just the capital 's economic impact that has been called into question			1
three quarters of those asked also felt the media focuses too much on @entity4 at the expense of other @entity5 cities			0
meanwhile 64 per cent of @entity91 claimed the government paid too much attention to issues in the capital , with only 17 per cent thinking @entity78 politicians were responsive to local issues			2
the only city to buck this trend was @entity99 , where a slightly more positive 21 per cent either strongly agreed to tended to agree with the claim that @entity101 was in touch with local issues			0
but despite feeling unhappy @entity103 get a much better deal than those living in other parts of the country , only one in five said they would consider moving to the capital to improve their opportunities			0
this , it was suggested , is down to a widespread belief that @entity4 is not a happy or comfortable place to live			0
responding to questions on their opinions of quality of life in the capital , 62 per cent on @entity76 described it as ' expensive ' , 59 per cent as ' crowded ' and 30 per cent as ' chaotic '			2
only 32 per cent thought @entity4 was a good place to raise a family .			2

only a quarter outside @entity4 agree capital is good for their local economy
trend magnified in cities such as @entity14 , where only nine per cent agree
