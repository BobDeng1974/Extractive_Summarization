by @entity0 this is the extraordinary arsenal of weapons belonging to gunman @entity3 who shot dead three policemen and a paramedic in @entity6 , @entity7 on tuesday			1
in these startling images , the 55 - year - old poacher 's dedicated gun room can be seen in full - stacked from floor to ceiling with hundreds of shotguns			1
other shooting paraphernalia , such as shotgun cartridges , can also be seen scattered all over the floor of the room in his remote farmhouse			2
police say the poacher would kill the animals and take their heads back as a trophy in another disturbing find , the @entity7 @entity35 discovered a room of ' hunting trophies ' - namely the skulls of deer and other game he killed while poaching at night			1
an enormous mound of skinless deer heads , still with their antlers attached , can be seen in another of @entity3 's rooms			1
it is thought that @entity3 shot and killed the animals before he sawed off their heads and took them back to his house			1
he then left their decapitated carcasses rotting under bushes in the nearby woods , police have said			0
@entity54 : @entity3 , pictured , was questioned by police before he went on a 12 - hour killing spree in @entity7 it is illegal to hunt wild animals for the ' trophy ' of their heads			1
poaching is severely punished and offenders can get up to three years in prison			0
hunters are licensed only after passing exams that test their knowledge of weapons , ballistics , hunting traditions , different kinds of game and their diseases - and a host of other disciplines			1
police suspected @entity3 of illegal hunting and confronted him on tuesday morning , pulling him over in his car while he was driving near to his home			1
the gunman then fled in his car , before shooting dead a member of @entity7 's @entity81 at a police checkpoint			1
an ambulance raced to the scene , but the gunman shot and killed its driver as he tried to give first aid to the dying policeman , police have said			1
the attacker then fatally shot another police officer at a roadblock before barricading himself in the farm building			0
later on tuesday , another officer who had been missing was found dead in his patrol car near the farm			2
the officer was killed after the suspect carjacked the police vehicle and took him hostage			2
the three police officers allegedly killed by @entity3 have been named as @entity102 , 51 , @entity103 , 44 , and @entity104 , 38			1
paramedic @entity105 was also killed			2
following the shootings , @entity3 barricaded himself in a farm building near @entity108 , about 40 miles west of @entity109			1
around 100 armed police commandos and several army tanks surrounded the farmhouse before @entity114 teams stormed the building			0
police found a charred body after pushing through a wall into a smoke - filled hidden basement on the farm grounds			1
regional police spokesman @entity121 told reporters @entity114 teams discovered the body after extinguishing a fire in a small cellar that was accessible only through a hidden door			1
forces : tanks and police cars arrive on the scene near @entity108 , @entity7 heavy armour : @entity133 tanks were called in to protect officers following the gunman 's rampage he said the corpse was so badly burned that it was impossible to identify			2
however , police assumed it was that of the gunman - who had been holed up on the farm grounds more than 24 hours before the charred remains were found			1
@entity143 added that police ' had to push against the wall to enter the room ' and that because ' the perpetrator could have been hiding behind each corner , ' the search took more than four hours			2
police said final identification and cause of death would have to wait until forensic experts had finished their work			0
killed : @entity156 police officers , members of the @entity157 , @entity102 51 , left and @entity103 , 44 killed : member of the @entity157 , @entity104 , 38 , left , and paramedic @entity105 they said the assumption was that the suspect had laid the fire			1
@entity156 tabloid @entity163 quoted a friend of the suspect who said he confessed to the shoot - out in a telephone call from his home as a police helicopter circled overhead and officers closed in			2
the suspect allegedly said : ' unfortunately it is true			0
i shot three policemen tonight			0
' i am the @entity176 poacher			0
they shot me too , in the stomach			0
but it does n't matter			0
' i shot @entity180 ( his @entity182 shepherd dog ) and they are not going to get me either			0
' the newspaper quoted the friend as saying the suspected gunman had confided two weeks ago that he was schizophrenic			0
police said he fired the last shot about an hour before helmeted officers wearing body armor and toting assault rifles piled into three @entity156 army tanks and moved in			2
scene : an aerial view of the house where the poacher barricaded himself in state prosecutor @entity198 says @entity3 is suspected in the illegal killing of numerous stags since 2005 and is also thought to have been the masked man who attacked a hunter with a knife two years ago , in what investigators now consider attempted murder			1
however those in the @entity6 or the cluster of surrounding hamlets dispute the claim			0
they describe the 55 - year - old as an expert who hunted legally and whose hobby turned into an obsession after his wife died about 15 years ago , leaving the childless widower with no close family			0
those willing to talk about him after the trauma left by his rampage still do n't believe that he was the man leaving the headless carcasses of deer in his wake			0
@entity227 said : ' we often went hunting for rabbits and pheasant			0
there was never any talk of poaching			0
' the provincial government of @entity7 ordered black flags flown from all public buildings in honor of the victims			0
in memory : a candle and a lantern stand on one of the sites where the gunman killed an officer			2
