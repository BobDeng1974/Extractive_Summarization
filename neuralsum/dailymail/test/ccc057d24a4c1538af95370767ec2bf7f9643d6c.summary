@entity0 took on @entity1 bishops yesterday after they questioned the morality of his austerity and welfare policies			1
in an @entity7 message to @entity8 , the prime minister insisted the @entity9 had spent five years ‘ trying to lift people up ’ by making work pay and encouraging responsibility			1
‘ just because some people have disagreed with our policies , does not mean those policies are missing in moral content , ’ he insisted			1
six weeks ago , the @entity1 provoked a row with ministers by publishing an unprecedented guide to how the country ’s 30million @entity8 should ‘ approach the @entity37 ’			1
bishops insisted it was not targeted at any particular party , and criticised successive governments while calling for a ‘ fresh moral vision ’			1
but much of the 50 - page document was widely interpreted as indirect criticism of the @entity9 ’s welfare policies , which include a £ 26,000 - a - year cap on household benefits , a new universal credit designed to ensure people are always better off in work and tough sanctions to prevent people languishing on jobless benefits			1
the bishops complained that welfare claimants were ‘ described in terms that imply they are undeserving , dependent and ought to be self - sufficient ’			2
they insisted it was ‘ game - playing … to claim that anyone who cares about the impact of austerity on the most vulnerable members of society is … careless about the extent of national indebtedness ’			2
the archbishop of @entity69 the @entity71 @entity70 - pictured ahead of a service for the re-burial of @entity74 at @entity75 last week - has seen the @entity1 come under fire from the pm despite evidence that the best - off are paying more in tax than ever before , the bishops also complained that ‘ the greatest burdens of austerity have not been borne by those with the broadest shoulders ’			1
official @entity86 figures suggest that the richest 10 per cent of households are contributing most to deficit reduction			2
archbishop of york @entity89 blamed welfare cuts and ' poverty wages ' for rising inequality speaking to @entity93 , mr @entity0 said the ‘ values of the @entity96 faith are the values on which our nation was built ’			1
‘ i ’m an unapologetic supporter of the role of faith in this country			2
and for me , the key point is this : the values of @entity7 and the @entity96 religion – compassion , forgiveness , kindness , hard work and responsibility – are values that we can all celebrate and share , ’ he added			1
mr @entity0 conceded he was not a model @entity8 and was ‘ a bit hazy on the finer points of our faith ’			1
‘ but even so , in the toughest of times , my faith has helped me move on and drive forward			0
it also gives me a gentle reminder every once in a while about what really matters and how to be a better person , father and citizen , ’ he added			0
the prime minister said he had attempted to ‘ banish the notion that being in government means you can somehow wave a magic wand and solve all the world ’s problems ’ , and instead it was about ‘ the right judgement … based on clear values and beliefs ’			1
he said the government had inherited ‘ exceptional pressure on the national finances ’ from @entity144 , adding : ‘ i am proud that despite the pressure on public spending , we made clear choices to help the poorest paid and most vulnerable in society			0
‘ we have increased @entity146 spending , despite the overriding need to deal with the deficit			0
we also raised the threshold of income tax to lift the poorest paid out of income tax altogether			2
‘ more fundamentally , the core of our recovery programme – dealing with the deficit to restore confidence in our economy – is based on enduring ideas and principles : hard work , fair play , rewarding people for doing the right thing , and securing a better future for our children			2
’ writing in @entity165 today , mr @entity30 said that the popular image of @entity96 was at odds with the reality of churches across the country , which daily offered ‘ thousands of quiet kindnesses ’ to those most in need			0
‘ to call yourself a @entity96 in contemporary @entity31 is to invite pity , condescension or cool dismissal			1
’ @entity179 is on course to lose his seat to @entity144 , a poll suggested yesterday			0
a survey of voters in the @entity187 leader ’s @entity185 constituency put @entity144 on 36 per cent of the vote compared with 34 per cent for the @entity187			0
prime minister 's wife : @entity191 arrives for a visit to @entity193 in @entity194 , @entity195 @entity191 yesterday visited a primary school in the seat of @entity198 and @entity199 , held by former @entity29 @entity200 , who defected to @entity201 and won a by - election last year			1
despite his victory , the @entity29 are hopeful of recapturing the seat at the @entity37			0
reckless ’s party @entity201 , meanwhile , has said 16 and 17 - year - olds should not be allowed to vote in a referendum on membership of the @entity211			0
its deputy chairman claims children are being exposed to ‘ propaganda ’ from @entity215 in a bid to ‘ catch them young ’			0
@entity201 said : ‘ it ’s everything there from colouring - in books on the @entity221 for primary schoolchildren right up to research projects at university level			0
‘ the amount of money that the @entity211 is putting into this propaganda and throughout the entire education system is enormous			0
' overall the @entity211 has an advertising budget that is larger than @entity230			0
’ it is thought the @entity187 would demand 16 and 17 - year - olds are given a say in any @entity211 referendum as part of a post-election coalition deal .			0
