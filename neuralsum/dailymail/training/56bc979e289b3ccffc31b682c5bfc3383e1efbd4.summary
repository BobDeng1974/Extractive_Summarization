' i think it 's culturally devastating and utterly deceitful , most people lose , ' @entity22 ceo and chair of the @entity25 reverend @entity24 told @entity26			1
' many of the clips - which can be viewed by children of any age in most instances - feature extremely extravagant high - rollers who boast about betting hundreds of dollars per spin			1
' this is really what 's got the public upset , parents are saying who asked them about their kids being handed over to gambling			0
kids have got smartphones at school where they can watch these videos , ' reverend @entity24 said			2

' so far it 's s * * * , ' he says after winning $ 3000			0
high rollers : the pokie porn videos feature massive bets and massive wins in the comments section he later wrote : ' i was not over the moon with it and i am in @entity65 and you can win much more then $ 10,000 on a poker machine in in the high roller areas where the max bet is actually $ 450 a hit			1

' it perpetuates that feeling of " where is the next roll of the dice ? where is the next pull of the pokie ?

' @entity16 users with popular channels are able to ' monetise ' their videos - meaning the website pays them a small percentage of the revenue earned from placing ads at the start of , and during , clips			1
it is unclear according to @entity16 's online policies if the clips are eligible for monetisation and the website did not immediately respond to requests for clarification			2
