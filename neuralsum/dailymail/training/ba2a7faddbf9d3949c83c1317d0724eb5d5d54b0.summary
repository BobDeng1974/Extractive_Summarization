@entity0 usually spread around the goals and the glory			2
they had hit the net 76 times this campaign but now , in their biggest game of the season , they drew a blank until injury - time			2
while @entity0 ’s strikeforce do not have the class of @entity13 ’s @entity12 , @entity14 and @entity15 , they should still have been good for more than @entity17 ’s late goal against @entity18			1
at times @entity19 , usually so reliable , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and the deeper - lying @entity23 looked like they had never played together			1
@entity0 's expensively assembled front line look dejected during the 3 - 1 @entity28 loss to @entity18 main men @entity20 ( centre ) and @entity19 ( third right ) could not find the net at the @entity33 @entity0 centre forward @entity19 was particularly guilty of missing several inviting chances @entity35 international @entity20 has gone off the boil since his blistering start to the season here at the @entity33 , the five figures @entity40 turned to in this first leg failed him			1
miserably , as it turned out , because his former club @entity18 romped to a 3 - 1 victory			1
despite @entity19 ’s catastrophic miss in the second half , when he skied a shot into the stands after @entity50 had failed to hold @entity20 ’s shot , there was something wrong about the reaction when he was substituted			1
@entity0 were 2 - 0 down by the time @entity19 was replaced by @entity55 in the 62nd minute			1
he left to howls of derision from home supporters			0
@entity19 , who has been leading the line brilliantly of late , did not deserve that			0
this @entity18 side are the clean - sheet kings , with five in their six @entity28 group games against @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			1
they are a resilient bunch the first cries of ‘ come on @entity0 , come on @entity0 ’ came after half an hour , betraying frustration that the forward line had hit a brick wall			0
they had @entity75 , @entity55 and @entity17 sitting on the bench			0
@entity22 ( second left ) races through but could not add to his meagre tally of goals for the season @entity82 playmaker @entity21 ( centre ) struggles to evade the attention of @entity18 defenders @entity18 keeper @entity50 claims another cross as @entity0 struggle to get on the scoresheet in - form @entity23 had a relatively quiet game in comparison to his recent displays for the @entity93 last weekend , when @entity0 went to @entity95 and won 2 - 1 , they kept plenty in reserve by boxing clever			1
here they lacked any punch , with the killer instinct deserting them after @entity18 had taken a surprise lead through @entity103 ’s deflected strike			2
@entity0 struggled to find their rhythm , blocked by the powerful presence of @entity106 , who might have given away a penalty when he appeared to handle , and @entity108			2
it is rare for this @entity93 team to look around for answers but they lacked conviction , returning to the bad old days when they believed they could walk the ball into the net			2
@entity18 took a surprise lead after @entity103 ( left ) shot was deflected off per @entity119 former @entity121 striker @entity120 doubled @entity18 's lead with a smart finish @entity18 's @entity124 celebrates after coming on to score their third in injury time sometimes @entity20 wants it too much , as he did on saturday when he was taken out of his comfort zone in the victory over @entity95			1
the @entity35 has been desperate to get things going again , to hit another purple patch like the one which saw him score in successive games against @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 in the autumn			0
@entity20 was electric then , the spark in this @entity0 team while they waited for the return of @entity21 from his injury lay - off			1
there were chances to make an impression in the first half , but @entity0 lacked the expression that they have shown during their recent run of good form			0
@entity19 hit a couple of chances high and wide in the opening 45 minutes and it is fair to say that much more was expected of the man up top			0
@entity40 watches on as his @entity28 hopes look to end in the last 16 for another season @entity0 could n't score despite calling on the likes of substitute @entity55 ( second left ) @entity21 produced some lovely touches , including a cushioned lay - off into the path of @entity164 as he made his way into the penalty area			1
for some reason , referee @entity167 penalised the full back for a foul			0
@entity55 offered an alternative when he came on , forcing a save from @entity50 that fell at the feet of @entity22			0
his follow - up shot struck @entity55 and flew over			0
@entity40 gambled , sending for @entity17 to replace @entity175 with 22 minutes left			0
he provided a goal , only for @entity0 to blow it again			0
@entity17 ( right ) came on to finally score , but @entity93 have it all to do in the second leg			2

@entity0 were defeated 3 - 1 by @entity18 in @entity28 last 16 clash
@entity93 *frontline* of @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity23 , @entity21 and @entity22 could n't find the net
@entity103 , @entity120 and @entity124 scored for the @entity186 side
substitute @entity17 came on to give home side a *lifeline*
