by @entity0 @entity1 : @entity3 's leader @entity2 the unite union is offering to teach unemployed @entity5 and @entity6 how to claim benefits in @entity8			1
the organisation , @entity11 ’s biggest donor , is courting foreigners from the two countries as part of a membership drive			1
it offers the advice as a reward for signing up to the union			1
it has even issued membership forms in @entity5 and @entity6 , despite the government – and @entity11 – saying immigrants should learn @entity24			1
the unemployed are offered the chance to join the union for just 50p a week			2
in return , @entity3 says it will offer new arrivals with advice on how to maximise benefit claims			2
the decision to target @entity5 and @entity6 is sure to be controversial , given public concern about the lifting of immigration controls on the two new @entity35 countries at the end of this month			1
ministers have refused to estimate how many immigrants will arrive from the two impoverished countries – but some experts believe it could run to hundreds of thousands in the coming years			0
@entity43 mp @entity42 called @entity3 ’s behaviour shameless , adding : ‘ it is incredibly irresponsible and i ’m afraid it just sums up the attitude of @entity11 and the trade unions towards @entity35 immigration			1
‘ @entity11 is the party that opened the floodgates to @entity35 immigration with its open borders policy			1
now their allies in the union movement are basically encouraging people to come here , and offering them advice on how to exploit our benefits system when they arrive			2
it gives the lie to the idea that @entity11 is finally getting serious about immigration			2
’ in recent years @entity3 , led by @entity2 , has directly targeted immigrant workers in a bid to swell its membership – and coffers			2
the @entity8 borders will be flung open this year as @entity5 and @entity6 will have access to the job market in 2011 its political officer @entity70 met with @entity72 and @entity73 , the @entity8 representatives of @entity5 ’s @entity75 , in a bid to urge migrant workers to join the @entity8 union			1
the union now issues its membership forms in a range of foreign languages , including those of countries whose workers do not have an automatic right to work in this country , such as @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			1
a union representative at @entity3 ’s @entity92 office explained to @entity5 national @entity93 in a phone conversation that , after signing up as a member for just 50p per week , she would receive help in finding work , housing and how to claim benefits : @entity93 : ‘ i am from @entity5 and i have just moved to @entity92 three weeks ago			1
i do not have a job and am looking for help to settle in and find a job			0
can i join the union ? @entity3 official @entity103 : ‘ yes , everyone is welcome			2
’ @entity105 : ‘ can you help me settle into the country ? @entity114 : ‘ you can send your cv , the officials can look at it and help you to find a job			0
we also offer a service that shows what benefits you are entitled to			0
’ the forms include details of its controversial ‘ community ’ branch , which is aimed at the unemployed			0
the organisation was launched last year to ‘ provide a way people can find and use their political voice ’			0
membership costs 50p a week , and includes a free ‘ welfare benefits check - up ... which makes sure you ’re claiming the right benefits ’			0
members are also offered free personal injury advice to pursue compensation claims			0
@entity43 mp @entity133 said : ‘ [ @entity3 ] would rather swell their membership coffers by encouraging new immigrants to claim the maximum amount of benefits , than represent their members – many of whom will be concerned about their own jobs being taken by these migrant workers			0
‘ rather than helping @entity5 and @entity6 claim more benefits , @entity3 should concentrate on reforming its own working practices to ensure @entity8 firms can stay competitive and jobs remain with the best @entity8 workers			1
’ a @entity3 spokesman stressed that migrant workers are ‘ all too often exploited by unscrupulous bosses , sometimes with tragic consequences ’ , citing the @entity153 tragedy in which 23 @entity89 cockle - pickers drowned			0
‘ @entity3 members , no matter what their nationality , can access and be signposted to advice on a whole host of issues , ’ they added			0
‘ are the @entity161 seriously accusing @entity3 and the likes of citizens advice of encouraging an influx of migrant workers because we signpost them to advice to stop them being exploited ? ’			0
