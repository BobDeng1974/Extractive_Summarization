by @entity0 - jones published : 06:55 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 10:03 est , 16 january 2014 the whirring of the milk float and chinking of the bottles used to be a sound as much a part of a morning as the dawn chorus of songbirds			0
but one dairy that was a victim to the rise of the supermarkets has ensured that a vivid picture of the old tradition remains by keeping detailed records and nostalgic photographs of their business			1
the archives of @entity20 of @entity21 preserve the cherished memories that have faded from our minds , showing pictures of old milk floats and a daily log of deliveries made to schools in the region			1
doing the rounds : a milk - man gets ready to deliver the bottles to the doorstep			0
the tradition might be a thing of the past but the archives of the @entity38 in @entity21 , @entity39 , are preserving the memories the records document the activities of the dairy , based in @entity39 , from the 1940s to the early 1990s , painting a picture of a time where levels of trust were so much higher that doors were n't locked and money was left on the top of the fridge			1
they are held by the council of @entity39 which has made them available to the public			1
sales records reveal exactly what was sold by the business on a weekly basis , including non-dairy products like fruit juice and bread			2
delivering milk for a century : the flier ( pictured left ) from 1982 celebrated the 100 year anniversary of the @entity38 's service to the east riding towns of @entity21 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 and ( right ) one of the workers shows bottles ready for the float @entity74 , one of four brothers involved in the business , remembers parents @entity78 and june going out twice a day on a horse and cart to deliver milk in @entity21 when he was just three			1
' they 'd be up at 3am leaving us in bed and they 'd be back at 7am , ' he said			0
' you had to do it twice a day in those days as milk was n't pasteurised then			0
by the time it got to tea - time it was on its way out			0
' after the horse and cart - the horse @entity97 was grazed on @entity98 opposite @entity93 - came electrical milk floats in their familiar green and cream livery			0
a proud tradition : the four @entity74 brothers are pictured with their father @entity78 ( centre ) in 1982			2
he is remembered by them as ' a stickler for work ' quality control : an employee in the @entity110 dairy is pictured in the 1980s inspecting the milk before it was taken out on the rounds in @entity39			1
the @entity38 ceased business in 1992 @entity39 towns @entity21 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 were all part of the @entity74 territory , whch expanded to include @entity118 and villages like @entity120 , when they bought @entity122			1
@entity124 brother @entity123 remembers times when levels of trust were far higher			0
' in @entity120 people would be out to work on the fields			0
doors were n't locked and you would go into the kitchen and the money would be on top of the fridge , ' he said			0
' there would be money for the butcher , the fishmonger and the milkman , all in separate heaps			0
you would look in the fridge and see how much milk there was			0
' the life of a dairy : records from the @entity150 ( pictured left ) and photographs dating as far back as the 1940s tell the story of the @entity39 family business through the decades			1
the owner , @entity155 , is pictured standing proudly on one of his milk floats in the 1960s @entity159 was first established in 1882 as a small - scale operation in the yard of 97 @entity162 , @entity21			1
it later grew to become the chief supplier of milk and other dairy products in the @entity21 area and was a strong competitor to @entity169 - which it eventually sold out to a century later			1
every member of the family had their role - @entity78 , a stickler for work - oversaw the milk testing , public health and customer care , @entity171 was on production and packaging , @entity74 would organise staff , @entity184 , office and accounts and @entity123 vehicle maintenance			1
they had 16 rounds at @entity21 , eight at @entity118 and five of school milk until @entity190 stopped it in the 1970s			2
a piece of history : a horse and cart was initially used to deliver the milk but in the 1950s @entity155 bought his first electric milk float ( pictured ) carrying the load : one of the dairy 's workers , @entity202 , is pictured with crates of milk bottles ready for delivery ready for business : @entity207 ( pictured ) was an employee of @entity74 's @entity38 in the 1960s			1
they delivered to @entity39 towns including @entity21 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 a detailed history : collections officer @entity211 ( pictured right ) hold photographs from the archive which also includes a milkman 's ledger ( pictured left ) listing all the deliveries on his round @entity219 was n't their traditional ground - people still like their ' steri ' , sterilised milk , whereas @entity21 was a firmly fat silver - top town			1
the fad for dieting led to a whole new range of skimmed milk being produced at the dairy - a reverse of the situation just a few years previously where there was no demand for milk with the cream skimmed off and it had to be fed to the pigs			2
when @entity78 retired , new rules which required a £ 2m upgrade of their dairy in @entity110 and falling profit margins due to customers switching to supermarket milk , were all factors in the decision to sell up			0
a family business : the @entity74 's @entity38 was founded in 1882 and ran for more than 100 years			1
@entity78 's brother @entity244 is pictured in the late 1940s they 'll play for @entity246 : the @entity74 's @entity38 delivered milk to local schools in the @entity39 area of @entity39			1
these boys are pictured in the 1950s surrounded by crates housing the milk : the @entity162 dairy is pictured in the 1970s			0
@entity155 's business expanded to include @entity118 and villages like @entity120 , when they bought @entity122 @entity123 added : ' the customer base was disappearing rapidly , it was a change in lifestyles			2
people were mortgaged up and interest rates were going up and instead of the wife being at home she was going out to work			0
' she did n't want the bottle on the doorstep going sour , they wanted a supermarket for convenience and it was getting cheaper			0
' we were doing four pint jugs at £ 1.10 - it does n't cost that much to buy 20 years on			2
the dairy farmers have had a raw deal i would say			0
' the business ceased trading in 1992 , but its memory will live on in the archives			2
@entity211 , collections officer at @entity279 , said : ' as generations come and go , these archives will act as a reminder of the days of the milkman , and teach us about what was once a way of life for millions			2

@entity74 's @entity20 was first established in 1882 as a small - scale operation in @entity21 , @entity39
the family business *closed* in 1992 , ten years after celebrating its 100 year anniversary
but photographs and records tell the story of life at the dairy from the 1940s to 1980s
the archives are held by @entity39 council who have made them available to the public
