this is the shocking moment a car bounced off the front of a lorry on a busy motorway sending it flying across the road after the driver pulled out without checking their mirrors			1
the hgv was travelling in the middle lane of the @entity11 in @entity12 at 35mph during wet weather conditions when it approached a blue @entity14			1
the car driver then forgot to check their mirrors and pulled out to change lanes , clipping the lorry and losing control before bouncing across the carriageway			1
the lorry , which was fitted with a dash cam , was travelling along the @entity11 in @entity12 when it approached a blue @entity14 the driver of the blue @entity24 appears to forget to check their mirrors and pulls out in front of the @entity9 the @entity24 was sent spinning so it ended up facing oncoming traffic before it clipped the side of a £ 50,000 @entity30			1
it then came to a halt after rolling backwards through traffic cones			2
fortunately no one was injured during the crash , which took place earlier this year			0
however , the driver of the @entity24 then blamed the lorry driver for the incident when it came to an insurance claim			2
but the trucker had a dash cam fitted and the insurers of @entity24 driver settled the claim as soon as the were shown the footage			1
@entity47 , managing director of @entity48 , which made the dash cam , said : ' this new video perfectly illustrates the camera 's worth			2
' these incidents in the days before cameras would result in a big drain on time and expense as both sides argued it out with insurers and also risked damaging hauliers ’ insurance claim experience			0
' not any more - the footage goes off and it is settled almost instantly			0
' the car then bounces off the front of the hgv , which sends it flying across the carriageway the @entity67 ends up facing oncoming traffic and eventually clips the side of a @entity30 before coming to a halt near to the traffic cones thousands of similar incidents happen on @entity75 ’s roads each year - with both drivers blaming each other for the collision			1
more and more motorists are buying dash cams though in the event they find themselves in a criminal or insurance dispute			0
the @entity84 recently found that 54 per cent of its members have now fitted in - cab cameras			0
there are around 550,000 whiplash claims filed every year in the @entity75 , but insurance experts have estimated that up to 60 per cent are bogus			0
since 2006 , there has been a 60 per cent rise in the number of personal injury @entity91 is despite number of reported accidents on @entity75 roads dropping by 20 per cent during the same period .			0
