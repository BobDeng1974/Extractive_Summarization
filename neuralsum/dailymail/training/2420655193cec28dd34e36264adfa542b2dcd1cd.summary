by @entity0 published : 18:00 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 02:35 est , 25 june 2013 almost half a million healthy women at high risk of breast cancer could be offered a daily pill to help prevent the disease			1
@entity6 should be given to those women who have a history of the disease in the family , according to @entity12 guidance			1
taking the drug for five years – costing just £ 120 in total – would cut the risk by more than a @entity16 the protection could last 20 years , according to clinical trials			2
new @entity12 guidance says tamoxifen will give women at high risk an alternative to having their breasts removed as chosen by celebrities including @entity26 and @entity27 it will provide women with an alternative to having their breasts removed , as chosen by @entity26 and @entity27			1
@entity6 has been used for almost 40 years to treat breast cancer			0
but now the @entity33 says it and another drug called raloxifene should be used for prevention			0
it says they are cost effective and likely to save the @entity12 money by cutting cases of the disease			0
trials show tamoxifen can prevent 35 to 45 per cent of breast cancers , with a similar reduction from raloxifene , which is used to treat osteoporosis in women who have gone through the menopause			0
it is the first time any health service has issued such widespread guidance , which could affect 3 per cent of women aged 35 and older – around 488,000 – in @entity53 and @entity54			0
@entity27 also opted for a mastectomy			1
but instead women could take the drug @entity6 for five years - costing just £ 120 in total - and cut their risk by more than a third they will be eligible if they have a family history that puts them at high risk , with a lifetime chance of developing breast cancer that exceeds 30 per cent , or ‘ moderate ’ risk of between 17 and 30 per cent			1
currently high - risk women can be offered annual mri scans from the age of 40			1
under the revised guidance , which also covers 400 men diagnosed with breast cancer each year , women with some genetic mutations will be offered annual scans from the age of 20 to 49			1
the new guidance says women at higher than average risk should be offered surveillance at younger ages to detect the disease earlier women at moderate risk could get annual x-ray scans from the age of 40 , while others could get annual checks after 50 instead of every three years with the routine @entity12 screening programme			1
but the most controversial plan is for the drugs to be prescribed as preventive therapy , as they are not licensed for such use here , although they are in the @entity92			0
the lifetime risk of breast cancer is one in eight , and almost 50,000 women a year are diagnosed with breast cancer			2
of these , around 2,400 patients have inherited faults in known breast cancer genes , while a further 5,000 to 7,000 women are affected by genes not yet identified			0
the guidance , which supersedes advice issued in 2004 , says people with a 10 per cent risk of developing the cancer should be offered genetic testing – the current threshold is 20 per cent – which should double the numbers eligible for a blood test			2
professor @entity111 from @entity112 in @entity113 , who helped develop the guidelines , said : ‘ this treatment is potentially not just cost - effective but cost saving to the @entity12 and more importantly for women they do n’t have to go through the stress and trauma of a diagnosis , radiotherapy , potentially chemotherapy			2
’ prof @entity111 said women whose risk of breast cancer was 80 per cent or above may still opt for surgery , which virtually eliminates the risk			2
menopause - like side - effects such as hot flushes usually stop after the first six months , and more serious problems are rarer , he added			0
baroness @entity130 , chief executive of the @entity131 , said the guidelines represented a ‘ truly historic moment ’			0
@entity134 , an @entity12 nurse specialising in breast care , said today that the drug could be a viable alternative to preventive mastectomy , which many women are wary of ' for lots of medical reasons but also for psychological reasons '			1
she told @entity143 's today programme , ' we will never be able to tell women exactly on an individual basis whether or not they 're going to develop breast cancer , ' but added : ' research is going on all the time to hone in on the people who will develop breast cancer			0
' ms @entity134 also said that some local @entity12 trusts were already offering tamoxifen as a preventive measure , which will now be available to women no matter where they live .			1

@entity12 guidance says tamoxifen will give women at high risk of cancer
will be an alternative to having breasts removed and cut risk by third
@entity26 and @entity27 both opted for mastectomy
