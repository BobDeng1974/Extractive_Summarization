by @entity0 published : 05:27 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 07:03 est , 28 november 2012 when home owner @entity2 moved in next door to a plastic recycling centre he thought he had found tidy and environmentally - friendly neighbours			1
but the frustrated resident has instead found himself living next to a growing rubbish dump that now towers 20 feet high at the back of his garden			1
cafe boss mr @entity2 , 57 , moved into his £ 70,000 terraced house ten years ago not realising bosses at the recycling depot were about to expand			1
a garden view : @entity2 in his back garden with views over the @entity17 polymers plastic recycling site home sweet home : mr @entity20 moved into his £ 70,000 property in @entity22 , @entity23 , ten years ago when there was still a recycling factory building next door aerial view : the a marker shows mr @entity2 's property next to the plastic recycling plant but now hundreds of tonnes of plastic scrap are piled up 20 feet high behind his back wall in @entity22 , @entity23			1
mr @entity2 is now urging for action from local councillors and the @entity36 against officials at @entity38			1
he said : ' when people are driving past they think it is a tip - but it ’s not , it ’s a plastic recycling centre			1
but i ’m not surprised people think that it is a tip because it looks like a dumping ground			2
frustrated : mr @entity2 says the expansion of the recycling plant has made his life a misery ' it is an absolute disgrace - it looks really awful and ca n’t carry on living like this			1
' it used to be quiet and tidy here but not now			2
this is the mess that i see over my back yard wall and every morning through the bedroom window			1
' since the company has grown , residents around here have been left with noisy wagons and this eyesore			0
we are going to start a petition and send it to the council			0
i was hoping to emigrate to @entity68 next year but i will never be able to sell the house			0
' my son is in the building trade and he said the house has devalued by £ 20,000			1
the council needs to do something			0
when i moved in it was not like this			1
i just do n’t know what to do because it ’s really getting me down			0
' mr @entity2 has also raised concerns about the health risks posed by the rat infested tower of rubbish			1
he added : ' there are rats everywhere and i ’ve even had to get two cats because we were getting so many of them			0
' it is only a metre away from my back yard			2
we have seen rats running about all over , you would n’t believe the amount the cats kill			0
' this is meant to be a plastic recycling centre but i do n’t see much recycling going on			1
' some say its like an ocean of plastic but i would say it was worse than that - it ’s like a tidal wave when you look out at it			2
' even the environmental health said that it was bad and he said that in his eyes it was illegal but they ’ve said what is happening is not illegal			0
' untidy : the view from mr @entity2 's back garden shows huge piles of plastic covering the @entity38 site health concerns : mr @entity2 claims the mound of plastic recycling at the plant is infested with rats and now owns two cats to help cope with the problem big loss : mr @entity2 claims the state of the recycling plant has devalued his property by £ 20,000 mr @entity2 said the problems started when a factory was torn down on the site and replaced with the dump			1
he said : ' when i moved in 10 years ago it was summer and everything was flowering and i had a reasonable view looking out over the factory and it was fine - but not anymore			1
' they found asbestos in the roof and demolished it and this started piling up			0
if the factory was still there it would n’t be like this			2
they would n’t be able to pile all this stuff up in a factory			1
campaign : mr @entity2 is now asking his local council and the @entity36 to take action against @entity38 ' there was a wall behind my yard which went straight across but they demolished that , i had to stop them demolishing the wall in front otherwise the rubbish would have been up to my back yard			1
' i kept thinking that something would be done about it because it was getting out of hand but nothing was ever done about it			0
' in winter when all the leaves have fallen and there are n’t my roses and clematis it looks really bare and all you can see is that eyesore			0
' i ca n’t get out because no one will want to buy the house and have this in their back yard			2
it just seems to be getting worse			0
i ca n’t win and it ’s so frustrating			0
' i do n’t look out of my window anymore i ’m at my wits end			0
i have blinds so i ca n’t see out at that eyesore			0
' neighbour @entity186 said : ' i knew @entity17 was there when i moved in , but can not believe how bad it is			2
' the view is dreadful and the noise from lorries , especially in the morning is terrible			0
i want the company or the council to do something about it			0
even a wall or screen between us and the recycling site would be an improvement			2
' @entity38 which handles in excess of 5,000 tonnes of plastic scrap per year has been operating legally at the site for many years and is not controvening any planning rules			1
it said its recycling operations met @entity36 and borough requirements			2
manager @entity208 said : ' we have controlled facilities for our waste and the items that we recycle disposed of accordingly			0
and as for the rats we are situated right next to the canal			0
' regenerating : mr @entity2 's property is located within the @entity218 regeneration area in @entity22 , @entity23 legal : v10 polymers have been operating at the site for many years and is not contravening any planning laws			1
