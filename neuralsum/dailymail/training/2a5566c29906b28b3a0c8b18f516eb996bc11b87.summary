by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 is trying to swell its ranks and train fighters using hit video game @entity6 , claiming that what players do in the game resembles their battlefield operations			1
they have posted a video to @entity13 carrying their flag showing violent scenes from the game , including police officers being gunned down and trucks being blown up			1
there are no real - life scenes in the video , which has been made using a mixture of the online multiplayer mode and the solo narrative			1
@entity48 media said that the video is meant to ‘ raise the morale of the @entity52 , and the training of children and young teenagers to fight the @entity56 , and throw terror into the hearts of opponents of the state ’ , according @entity50			2
it came as a @entity62 who was interviewed by @entity2 to work in its media centre revealed just how slick and well - funded its pr machine is			1
experts believe that the terrorist organisation has amassed the money necessary to run such a formidable operation partly by smuggling oil from oil fields that it ’s taken control of			2
the @entity62 said he had a job interview with @entity2 to work in its media centre in @entity76 , @entity62 's capital , and that he was amazed at the salary he was offered and the equipment he would have at his disposal			1
the man , who turned the job down , told the @entity82 : ' they offered me $ 1,500 a month [ five times the average @entity62 salary ] , plus a car , a house and all the cameras i needed			2
i remembered looking around the office			2
it was amazing the equipment they had in there			2
' the @entity93 is becoming increasingly focussed on finding out precisely where the group 's money is coming from			0
@entity97 and other leaders will discuss the issue at next week 's annual @entity100			0
and a new @entity93 - based research group called the @entity102 is poised to release to governments and media outlets a database of information about militants and their supporters			2
it 's convinced that @entity2 is generating a great deal of wealth – it ’s thought to have stockpiled around £ 1billion - from shady deals with morally compromised companies			1
risk management group @entity114 believes that @entity2 controls half a dozen oil fields in @entity62 and four in @entity117 , with many officials convinced it 's making millions from smuggling barrels to @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity117			1
the @entity93 is becoming increasingly focussed on finding out precisely where the group 's money is coming from the group is also known to make money from kidnappings , extortion and robbery			0
more airstrikes are expected this week against the group , and @entity93 ambassador to the @entity100 @entity132 said on @entity133 sunday morning that other countries were willing to join the @entity93 in these strikes , though she would not say what countries			0
these strikes have already begun in @entity117 , and been authorized to begin in @entity62 by @entity97			0
in addition , the @entity138 approved a bill to train and arm moderate @entity62 rebels to battle @entity143 militants			0
meanwhile , a description of @entity146 by @entity2 as an ‘ uncircumcised old geezer ’ is further evidence of @entity150 involvement in the militant organisation , a terrorism expert has said			1
the comment about the @entity93 secretary of state came in an audio recording by @entity2 spokesman @entity155			1
he said : ' the uncircumcised old geezer , suddenly became an @entity157 jurist , issuing a verdict to the people that the @entity143 was distorting @entity157 , that what it was doing was against @entity157 teachings , and that the @entity143 was an enemy of @entity157			0
' professor @entity164 , head of the centre for security and intelligence studies at the @entity168 , said the use of @entity150 slang was hugely significant			0
he told @entity1 : ‘ i 'd say the use of the word " geezer " is a massively important further giveaway about the identity of some of these @entity2 thugs			1
it 's a term most usually heard in @entity179			0
' so @entity2 have drawn us , i 'd suspect intentionally , back towards reflecting on the fact that brits are fighting for these sadistic butchers , taunting not just the families of the hostages but our government and our position in the world			1
' @entity150 's link to @entity143 became known around the world after shocking videos showed a @entity150 man known as ' @entity194 ' executing @entity93 journalists @entity195 , 40 , and @entity197 , 31 , as well as @entity150 aid worker @entity198 , 44			0
some sources believe that @entity194 comes from a @entity179 suburb about 10 miles from @entity201			0
professor @entity164 added : ' it 's my understanding that @entity204 and the counter-terrorism police do know the identity of " @entity194 " but that like the @entity150 government more generally they do n't see any advantage at this stage in telling the rest of us , not so much out of consideration to " @entity194 's " family but to the hostages because this is about the lives of innocent hostages here , and every move that we take needs to be very carefully considered before we take it			0
