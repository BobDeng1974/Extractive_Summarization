a baby monkey narrowly avoided becoming leopard lunch in the @entity12 bush , after the hungry predator started playing games			1
the young monkey was resting in a marula tree when the female leopard attacked , but despite catching the primate on at least three occasions , she kept setting it free to continue the playful chase			1
however , as the leopard was getting ready for game over , the tiny monkey managed to escape from the tree by bravely leaping from a tree and scurrying off into nearby reeds			1
safari tour leader , @entity38 , 36 , was able to catch the incredible moment after an urgent message came crackling through his radio whilst driving through the @entity42 of the @entity12 bush			0
@entity38 said ‘ it was a calm summer ’s morning when suddenly we received a very broken call over the two - way radio that we should come quickly			0
‘ i was shocked when i first arrived , i have heard snippets of behaviour of this sort in the past but never to this extent			0
' on the menu : the leopard stands on its hind legs as it makes one of its initial attempts tries to catch the monkey in the tree in @entity12 the one that got away : the dance begins as the monkey escapes from the leopard 's claws up the tree : the leopard claws at the monkey as makes its way up a marula tree reaching out : it 's claws out for the predator and it is just inches away from grabbing hold of the monkey 's leg considering a diet ? the leopard catches the tail of the monkey for a moment before letting it go , continuing the chase ‘ however , i soon began explaining to my guests that we were very privileged to witness such a scene and that this is was nature in its true form			1
‘ the leopard was a young female that was hunting , i can only guess that it was a game of cat and mouse and was using the monkey to test her skills			2
‘ on at least three occasions , the leopard got a hold of its prey and then for some reason , let it go , i imagine it was to just keep the game going			0
‘ eventually , the monkey leapt from the top of the tree , followed by the leopard to safety			2
‘ i do n't think she intentionally let it go , i think the monkey had a very lucky escape			0
’ hello lunch , let 's dance : neither leopard nor monkey makes a move as they face off in the top of the marula tree in @entity119 , @entity12 not letting go this time : the leopard stalks the tiny baby monkey to the very edge of a tree branch in the final stages of the chase jump for freedom : the leopard makes one last desperate jump as it realises the monkey is making a swift escape into the nearby bushes			1

@entity134 chased baby monkey around a tree in @entity12
despite catching up the primate thrice , female leopard kept letting it go
unfortunately for her , it led to the lunch escaping into the bushes
