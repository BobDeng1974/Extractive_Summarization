by @entity0 @entity1 from @entity2 , @entity3 , has chocolate allergy which triggers asthma when you tuck into those chocolate eggs this @entity8 , spare a thought for @entity1			1
for even one tiny bite of chocolate could trigger her asthma and lead to a potentially life - threatening attack			1
most people think asthma is brought on by dust or pet fur , but there are many triggers for the characteristic coughing , wheezing , tightness in the chest and shortness of breath			1
however , many of the 5.4 million @entity27 with asthma - and even some @entity29 - are n't aware of these , and failing to identify and then avoid their more unusual triggers could put them at risk			1
indeed , @entity1 , 41 , never thought chocolate was making her asthma worse until december 2012 , when her asthma consultant suggested she looked at her diet after a number of attacks			1
' i ate chocolate every day so thought it might be a trigger and started cutting down , ' says @entity1 , a school learning assistant who lives with her three children in @entity2 , @entity3			1
' my asthma seemed to improve , although i still did n't really believe chocolate was a trigger because i 'd never heard of that before			1
' but a terrifying experience a few months later made her realise it was			2
she 'd given in to temptation and bought her favourite chocolate bar , a @entity46			1
after the first bite , she started coughing but finished it all because her craving was so bad			2
her coughing worsened and she was struggling to breathe - even a reliever inhaler , which relaxes the lung 's airways that can become inflamed in an asthma patient , did n't help			1
she went to an out - of - hours emergency doctor , who put her on a nebuliser , which gives high doses of reliever medicine through a mask or mouthpiece , easing her symptoms			2
' i was astounded chocolate caused that reaction , ' she says			1
' looking back , it 's possible it played a part in other attacks i 'd had			1
' since then , @entity1 , whose severe asthma is also triggered by dust mites , hay fever and mould , has avoided chocolate			1
patients who do n't know all their triggers can risk asthma symptoms or attacks , says @entity79 , clinical lead nurse at @entity80			1
' everyone 's triggers are different and can be difficult to identify			0
it can take people years to understand their asthma			1
sometimes this can be because their triggers are more unusual , such as chocolate , wine or fizzy drinks , ' she explains			1
' potential triggers are all around us			0
health professionals need to be open - minded when patients report what they think makes their asthma worse			2
' people whose asthma is triggered by chocolate may not be having a true allergic response @entity75 ' airways become inflamed in response to irritant triggers such as exercise , stress or cold weather , or allergic triggers such as pollen or dust mites			1
irritants make vulnerable airways inflamed and narrow			0
this leads to contractions of the muscle of the bronchi ( the main airway of the lungs ) , causing breathlessness and other symptoms			0
with allergic ones , the immune system goes into overdrive and sees the harmless substance , which can be inhaled or ingested , as dangerous			0
an antibody , immunoglobulin e ( @entity125 ) , looks for the allergen and signals to the immune system to produce powerful chemicals including histamine , which cause inflammation and swelling in @entity134 cells , which produce mucus , are also set off			0
this results in thick , sticky mucus in the airways - one of the biggest problems during an attack is making huge amounts of mucus you ca n't clear , explains ms @entity79			0
allergic asthma is often seen in people with a family history of atopy ( predisposition to produce high amounts of @entity125 ) , including hay fever , eczema and food allergy , she adds			1
the proportion of people with asthma who 've had an attack in the past year triggers can be identified through skin - prick tests , where a tiny amount of the suspected allergen is injected into the skin			2
a red , itchy bump larger than 3mm appearing after ten minutes confirms allergic sensitisation to that substance , says dr @entity165 , a consultant respiratory physician at @entity166			0
blood tests are also used , when blood is mixed with allergens and checked for @entity125			0
but these only look for specific allergens and can give misleading results			0
for suspected food allergy triggers , patients can take challenge tests , ingesting small amounts of the substance under medical observation			2
' but access to allergy services is extremely limited across the @entity80 , ' says dr @entity165			2
some people find they have more triggers over time , while others may show a lessening of triggers			0
however , dr @entity165 believes people whose asthma is triggered by certain foods such as chocolate are not having a true allergic response involving the immune system , but have been irritated by chemicals they contain known to aggravate some people 's asthma			1
' chocolate is rich in organic compounds called amines that can provoke allergic - type reactions in some people , ' he explains			2
there are natural and artificial chemicals in other foods and drinks that could be triggers - for example , alcohol has naturally - occurring amines and salicylates , and preservatives like sulphate , which are not commonly regarded as triggers , but can lead to symptoms			0
there are natural and artificial chemicals in other foods and drinks that could be triggers mother - of - one @entity216 discovered at 18 that vodka was a trigger for her , and needed her reliever when it left her unable to breathe			2
' other types of alcohol do n't trigger my asthma but when i 've tried vodka since , the same thing happened , so i avoid it , ' says the hotel receptionist , now 38 , from @entity228 , @entity229			1
dr @entity165 says salicylates ( the active ingredient in aspirin ) can be found in herbs , spices and mint - so even toothpastes and mouthwashes may lead to symptoms			0
@entity238 , 30 , had an attack after using her mother 's toothpaste instead of her own			0
' within an hour of using it i was in hospital , ' says the pub manager from @entity246			0
' the consultant said it was likely to be a chemical in the toothpaste			0
' unfortunately , there are n't validated tests for substances that provoke chemical sensitivities , so recognising patterns is vital , says dr @entity165			0
being aware of triggers can also help because there are additional treatments for allergic asthma			2
one treatment , approved for @entity80 use last year , is @entity262 , an injection which tackles @entity125			0
' new treatments are being developed , so patients should receive more tailored treatment , ' says dr @entity165			0
drugs known as leukotriene antagonists , such as @entity270 tablets , which block a chemical reaction that can cause inflammation in airways , can also be effective for allergic asthma , adds dr @entity274 , a consultant respiratory physician at @entity275 @entity276 in @entity277			2
' as well as trying to avoid triggers , it 's crucial to take your preventer inhaler ( containing steroids ) daily to build up protection - this should reduce the effect of triggers , ' says @entity79			0
people with asthma should think carefully about what may be triggering symptoms , adds @entity1			1
' they may need to think outside the box			0

eating cocoa sweet treat can trigger asthma and even attacks
