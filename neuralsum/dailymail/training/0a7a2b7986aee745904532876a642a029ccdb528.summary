by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:06 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 14:10 est , 30 may 2013 future peace negotiations in @entity3 are now in jeopardy after the @entity3 @entity6 's deputy leader @entity5 was killed in a @entity8 drone strike on wednesday			1
@entity5 was considered the best chance for talks with the incoming @entity3 government over his more hardline superior , @entity12 , who remains at large			1
the @entity3 @entity6 withdrew their offer of peace talks today , a group spokesman said			1
it is also widely believed that the @entity18 militant movement has selected a replacement for @entity5			1
killed : @entity5 , deputy commander of the @entity6 , was allegedly one of seven people killed in a @entity8 drone attack in the @entity23 region @entity6 spokesman @entity24 said the group is discussing whether @entity26 , @entity5 's deputy , will succeed him as head of the militant group 's most powerful branch in @entity30 , which would effectively make him the second - in - command			1
two @entity6 commanders said commanders voted in favor of @entity26 at a meeting , but @entity24 said a vote had yet to be taken			2
@entity5 was killed yesterday when drone - fired missiles landed on a house on the outskirts of @entity41 , the main town in the @entity23 tribal region			2
four other people were killed , according to @entity3 intelligence officials			2
two militants also confirmed that they had attended his funeral on wednesday night but spoke on condition of anonymity			0
journalists have little access to the tribal regions bordering @entity53 , making independent confirmation of his death difficult			0
@entity26 is believed to be about 40 years old and is known mainly for coordinating attacks in @entity53 , say intelligence and militant sources			0
he was responsible for organizing an assault on a prison in northwestern @entity3 in april 2012 in which close to 400 prisoners , including 20 who were considered dangerous insurgents , were freed			0
@entity24 also told @entity66 in a telephone call from an undisclosed location that the militants withdrew an offer to join peace talks because they believe the @entity3 government approves of the @entity8 drone strikes , despite official statements to the contrary			1
he also formally confirmed that @entity5 had been killed			0
willing to talk : @entity5 , centre , was poised to take over leadership of the @entity6 controversial : drone attacks like the one that killed @entity5 are a highly contentious method of tackling the @entity6 and other militants ' we had made the offer for peace talks with the government with good intention but we think that these drone attacks are carried out with the approval of the government so we announce the end of the talks process , ' he said			1
three of the others killed were mid-level @entity3 aides to @entity5 , two @entity3 intelligence officials said , also speaking on condition they not be identified because they were not authorized to release the information			2
they said they are still trying to confirm the nationality and identity of the fifth militant			0
@entity100 spokesman @entity99 declined to confirm wednesday if @entity5 was dead			0
however , he said if true , @entity5 's death would deprive the militant group of its chief military strategist , a man the @entity8 says was involved in an attack that killed seven @entity107 employees in @entity53			1
in 2010 , @entity108 offered $ 5million for information leading to @entity5			0
@entity3 's incoming prime minister , @entity110 , had said that he was ready to negotiate with the @entity3 @entity6 but @entity5 's death has now deprived the process of a key player			1

this drone attack is the first since the country ’s general election on may 11 where the @entity8 ’s use of the unmanned aircrafts was one of the most debated issues			0
it followed president @entity126 's speech last thursday during which he pledged more restrictive rules on the use of drones			0
the @entity3 @entity6 has been battling government forces for years in a bid to push them from the tribal regions , cut @entity3 's ties with the @entity8 and eventually establish their brand of hardline @entity18 across @entity3			1
