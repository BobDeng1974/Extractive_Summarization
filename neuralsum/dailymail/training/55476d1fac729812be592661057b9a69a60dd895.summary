when most people are feeling charitable they might sponsor a child or throw a fundraising event - but @entity4 chose to walk 5,000km around @entity5 in a @entity7 outfit			1
the 47 - year - old left his hometown of @entity10 on november 2 last year to raise funds for the @entity12 and hopes to see his wife and three children by july next year - or earlier if his weary blistered feet can get him there any sooner			1
the former soldier spends weeks at a time not speaking to anyone other than himself and the animals that cross his long endless dusty path - with fresh roadkill now a regular part of his daily diet			1
' the tasty wildlife includes cooking lizards until crispy and putting them in ziplock bags to snack on during the trek and tying live snakes to his trolley until they are suitably fried by the sun. @entity4 , who says it all comes down to survival , has also feasted on a cow , goat and many a @entity62 by cooking the meat on a wire grill			1
' i can only carry so much food - it 's not like there 's always a servo up the road , ' he said			2
' i need the protein to keep going			0
' @entity4 has been travelling for just over 12 months now and hopes to make it back to @entity10 in july next year the 47 - year - old goes days and weeks without showering or talking to anybody with only himself and the animals to talk to - @entity4 is quickly getting sick of his own compnay he is currently in @entity76 located 26 km southeast of @entity77 in the @entity78 he was taught survival skills in the army but never used them to such an extreme until now			1
' you pick up things along the way - it comes naturally because if you do n't eat - you are going to die			1
' but do n't feel too sorry for the lone adventurer - when @entity87 caught up with @entity4 he was chowing down on a @entity90 's @entity89 meal in @entity91 - 26 km southeast of @entity77			1
' anything that you do n't cook yourself tastes awesome , ' he said			2
a year into his crazy adventure - @entity4 can now tick off the following places on his mammoth list : @entity99 , the @entity100 - from the east to the @entity102 - and then up to @entity103 and across the @entity78 border to @entity105 and @entity77			1
he does n't advise anyone to take on this challenge on their own : ' solo is not the way to go - it 's way too hard ' @entity4 is only resting his exhausted body about five hours a day as he walks though the night as much as possible and then sleeps until the sun becomes unbearable literally living in his own stench - @entity4 can go days or weeks without showering or brushing his teeth because he needs to conserve all of the water that he is carrying in his trolley for drinking			1
' i feel absolutely terrible when i put on my black skins in the morning i ca n't stand the smell but i ca n't afford to use the water for washing my clothes , ' he said			2
@entity4 is only resting his exhausted body about five hours a day as he walks though the night as much as possible and then sleeps until the sun becomes unbearable			1
he rolls his swag out under any form of shelter that he stumbles across including bbq areas , outside toilet blocks and under trees			2
made out of @entity133 plastic , the suit is a bit worse for wear and is being held together with fibre glass and tape - but at the least the clanging of the armour scares off the snakes			2
' it 's ridiculous - i have no range of movement , ' he said			0
' it 's really uncomfortable and rubs causing welts and blisters			0
' ' i 'm surprise it has lasted this long			0
' only being unwell once briefly when coming into @entity149 , it 's not his physical state that has been the most testing but the constant mental challenge @entity4 's @entity154 helmet makes a friend that is not suitable for dinner made out of @entity133 plastic , the suit is a bit worse for wear and is being held together with fibre glass and tape @entity4 has gone through 20 pairs of shoes			1
his current pair have been the most endurable lasting 3,000 km after he made a sole from a blown - out tyre on the side of the road			0
only being unwell once briefly when coming into @entity149 , it 's not his physical state that has been the most testing but the constant mental challenge			0
' i 'm constantly arguing with myself - i start questioning it and thinking no one cares and that i 'm yesterday 's news , ' he said			0
' when i have n't seen anybody for a long time i think it 's a case of out of sight - out of mind			2
' ' then i see someone and they say something encouraging and i 'm on top of the world again - and that cycle keeps going , ' he said			0
' i 've been winning and losing throughout the whole battle			0
' @entity4 is eternally grateful for the support of his family - especially his understanding wife , @entity189			1
' she knows me - i 've been talking about doing it for a long time - so she said to get it out of the way , ' he said			0
' i owe her big time after this - i 'll make it all better again			0
' @entity4 has gone through 20 pairs of shoes			2
his current pair have been the most endurable lasting 3,000 km after he made a sole from a blown - out tyre on the side of the road he said the people he meets along the way keeps up his spirits @entity4 would never advise anyone to take on this epic challenge without support			1
' solo is not the way to go - it 's way too hard , ' he said			0
' do it with a couple of people or a group for the mental stimulation and to encourage each other			0
' he 's very quickly getting bored of his own company			0
' i 'm sick of hearing my own voice - you have to constantly keep motivating yourself because you spend 10 hours a day looking at a white line , ' he said			0
' i talk to the animals that coming running to the fence			0
' but the courageous @entity227 character wo n't give up until he makes it home with raising his target of $ 100,000 for the @entity12 in @entity10			1
' if i do n't reach the target i will deem it a massive epic fail , ' he said			2
help @entity4 reach his target by donating on his fundraising page			1
