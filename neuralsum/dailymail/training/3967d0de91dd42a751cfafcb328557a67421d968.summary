as chairman of the @entity17 energy and climate change select committee , @entity3 has called for the urgent building of renewable energy sources and claimed it may be necessary ‘ to bribe ’ communities to accept wind farms			1

but he has joined local residents in opposing plans for a 130 - metre turbine five miles from his home in his @entity35 constituency			1
mr @entity3 , 68 , last night denied that his position made him a @entity37 ( not in my back yard )			2
he told the @entity40 : ‘ my own view is that wind turbines are a good idea , but i have always said in rural areas if the local community feels very strongly they should be able to say no in some circumstances			2
‘ wind turbines can be environmentally very intrusive			2
' in this case there ’s a little village , @entity51 , with less than 200 people			0
it would be very prominent in relation to this little village and i fully understand their objections to it			0
’ mr @entity3 , who was last night speaking against the wind turbine at a public meeting , said : ‘ i ’ve promised to use all the influence i ’ve got to persuade the local authority to reject it			1
‘ onshore wind is a technology which has a contribution to make in @entity67 , in the right place			2
mr @entity3 has joined local residents in opposing plans for a 130 metre turbine five miles from his home in his @entity35 constituency [ file picture ] ' but i do n’t think they should be imposed on a little village where the residents think it would be environmentally damaging			1
’ last year mr @entity3 said it was time to ' work harder to find places where wind farms are acceptable ' @entity78 , 75 , chairman of @entity79 , admitted mr @entity3 ’s intervention could be seen as ‘ odd ’ considering his position on green energy , but added : ‘ he has been besieged by residents and has listened patiently to them			1
’ mr @entity78 said : ‘ it is a beautiful area criss - crossed with footpaths and they are going to plonk a 130 - metre monster in the middle of it where it is going to affect everybody			0
