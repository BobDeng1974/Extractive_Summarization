by @entity0 a @entity2 grandmother has been reunited with her @entity4 pen pal nearly 70 years after she first posted an advert in a @entity7 newspaper looking for a long - distance friendship			1
@entity9 was a 15 - year - old schoolgirl when she placed an advert in the @entity11 in 1947 , looking for new friends around the world			1
@entity14 , 14 , from @entity15 , saw the notice and responded to the @entity2 teenager - with the first of hundreds of letters the pair would exchange over the years			2
@entity21 , 82 , from @entity15 and @entity9 , 83 , pictured right , from @entity22 , @entity23 , have been reunited 70 years after they began writing to one another as pen pals mrs @entity9 , now 83 , sent the advert after the death of her father @entity28 , a fisherman , died in 1945 , aged 45			1
as their special relationship blossomed , mrs @entity21 , now 82 , sent sweets and clothes to her @entity34 pen pal as she coped with post-war @entity2			1
their correspondence then continued for decades , as both women married , had children and went through the deaths of their husbands			0
mrs @entity21 said : ' we would talk about our everyday life - what we felt about the war			0
we were n’t as close to the war whereas @entity9 was right next to it			2
' we explained to our neighbours that there was this family that had nothing , not even a father , and my mother would send out these great big boxes with dresses , candy bars and things hidden in the coats			0
' the pair began writing after mrs @entity9 sent an advert into the @entity11 newspaper in the @entity4 , pictured above , when she was aged 15 , asking if the paper could help her find an @entity4 pen friend mrs @entity9 - who is known as @entity65 to her friends - originally decided to write to the @entity4 after losing her father in 1945			1
she said : ' i thought one day i would like to travel and the way to do that was to make some friends around the world and to find out what the world was like			2
' i just wanted to write to someone after everything so i wrote to the paper in the hope of finding an @entity4 pen pal			1
' her letter , addressed to one of the @entity11 ’s reporters @entity83 , was printed in full on page 10 of the monday , march 31 1947 edition			1
it read : ' on reading your article in the paper i thought you ’d be able to help me to get a pen friend in @entity4			1
' my age is 15 and a half years and my hobby is collecting film stars ’ pictures			2
i ’m very interested in writing to a friend in the @entity4			0
hoping you will oblige and to hear from you or pen pal soon			1
' when mrs @entity21 discovered her pen pal was being raised by a single mother after the death of her father , she asked her family to send things though the post			1
her parents gathered clothing , food and other essentials and posted them to @entity34 - an act of kindness that mrs @entity9 says she has never forgotten			0
from then on , the duo wrote to each other constantly before losing touch for about ten years			2
but after the internet was created , mrs @entity21 tracked down mrs @entity9 's brother 's email address - with whom she was living at the time			1
mrs @entity21 , a former data analyst for @entity120 , said : ' the computer came in and i started looking for @entity9 but i could n’t remember her married name			0
' i started looking on the internet and i sent an email to a man named @entity127			0
it turned out to be @entity9 ’s brother who she was living with at the time so he put us back in touch			2
' that ’s the thing that surprised me - i thought she might have decided that she did n’t want to write to me anymore but she did			0
' mrs @entity9 , pictured here in 1949 when she was crowned @entity134 in @entity22 , wrote to the newspaper when she was grieving over the death of her father , who died in 1945 the pair later met up in @entity4 when mrs @entity9 and her daughter @entity139 travelled to the @entity4 to visit mrs @entity21			1
but this is the first time that mrs @entity21 has visited the home of which mrs @entity9 wrote so vividly during the post-war years			1
mrs @entity9 , nee @entity127 , married a widower , @entity143 , at the age of 21 and had two step - daughters and two girls of her own			0
mrs @entity21 married her husband @entity147 , to whom she was married for 33 years , and had two daughters and two sons			0
when mr @entity150 died in december , and after having open - heart surgery in may , mrs @entity21 finally decided to book a flight to @entity2			0
the letters writers were in contact for decades but almost lost touch as their lives went in different directions			1
they re-started their correspondence when mrs @entity21 looked for @entity160 on the internet - and found her brother 's email address mrs @entity9 said : ' i was amazed that she came because i was afraid that something would happen - but she ’s a tough old bird , she really is			2
' life went on and we lost touch for a few years but it was great when we managed to get back in contact in the 90s			1
we ’ve shared a lot over the years and it ’s been so lovely having her here			0
' @entity21 is just incredible , she had a heart operation before she came out in may and i thought she may not be able to come			0
' we ’ve had such an amazing time			0
i ’m going to be really sad to see her leave but we ’ve had some lovely trips out			0
' mrs @entity21 's daughter , @entity178 , who has travelled to the @entity2 with her mother , added : ' it ’s like she ’s come alive again since she got to @entity22			0
