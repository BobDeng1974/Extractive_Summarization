phones have been blamed for creating a generation of people who can only communicate in so - called ‘ text speak ’ and smiley faces			1
but a pair of @entity7 developers is hoping to expand our vocabularies with the launch of its @entity12 app. the app uses an algorithm to automatically replace words in messages with synonyms – and users can collect words to compete with their friends			1
it changes the words used in text messages while keeping the sentence structure and meaning the same			1
the original words are shown right and the updated words are shown left ‘ learning new vocabulary can be stressful and challenging , but it does n't have to be , ’ explained @entity32 and @entity25			1
‘ with @entity12 , your casual conversations become learning opportunities			0
’ they added that @entity12 is ‘ much smarter than an electronic thesaurus ’ because it maintains the sentence structure and the idiomatic usage of words it replaces			1
there are more than 800 words that can be used , and subsequently collected , and the aim is to achieve the ‘ words crown ’ by collecting them all			1
the general meaning of a new word is the same as the word it is replacing , but users can tap it to see a full dictionary definition ( pictured )			2
they can also revert it back to the original word , and recipients can press the lightbulb icon to see what the sender initially typed with @entity61 , users commit @entity63 characters and definitions to memory with the help of animations and mnemonics			2
for example , the symbol for ' cow ' resembles a cow carrying a neck yoke			0
and ' noodles ' look like a bowl of noodles being eaten with chopsticks			0
users then review the characters periodically - a technique known as ' spaced repetition '			0
the firm compares the learning process to ' growing a garden of memory ' , with the premise being that when users learn words , they plant virtual seeds , which ' grow and bloom the more they review and practise			0
' the general meaning of a new word is the same as the word it is replacing , but users can tap it to see a full dictionary definition			2
this also shows the history of the usage of the word			2
they can also revert it back to the original word , and recipients can press the lightbulb icon to see what the sender initially typed			0
it is only currently available in the @entity111 and the words have been taken from college curriculums including those used in @entity116 exams			0
and once the initial list of words has been learnt and collected users can download extension packs for $ 6.99			1
@entity12 is also only available in @entity121 , but the firm told @entity123 it is hoping to develop foreign language versions if the app is a success .			0

@entity128 was created by developers @entity24 and @entity25
it changes words in text messages to boost a user ’s vocabulary
the sentence structure and meaning , or idiomatic usage , stays the same
for example , ‘ have a good time ’ becomes ‘ have a *congenial* time ’
tapping a word shows its definition and users can change it back
words can also be collected and users can compete with their friends
