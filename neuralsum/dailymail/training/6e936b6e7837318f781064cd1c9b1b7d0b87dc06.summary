a piece of papyrus used to make a mask worn by a mummy , may contain the oldest known copy of a gospel			1
the recycled material bearing part of the @entity8 was written in the first century and predates the next oldest surviving copy of gospel texts by about a century , according to experts			1
the text , which is set to be published , was extracted using a technique that allows glue used in the construction of mummy masks to be dissolved , without harming ink on the papyrus			1
it does however , destroy the original artefact			0
while the death masks of pharaohs may have been made of gold , it was common for lower status ancient @entity25 to be buried with masks constructed from papyrus , paint and glue - a type of papier - mâché			1
because papyrus was expensive , people often reused sheets , which were already written on			2
scientists at @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38 , unglued the mask to make the find			1
@entity41 , a professor of @entity42 , told livescience : ‘ we 're recovering ancient documents from the first , second and third centuries ’ used in mummy masks			2
he said that classical @entity48 texts including the poetry of @entity50 , biblical documents , business papers and dated letters have been found so far			1
classical @entity48 texts including the poetry of @entity50 , biblical documents , business papers and dated letters have also been recovered so far from masks			1
@entity57 was expensive and so it was recycled to make masks			2
this famous ancient @entity61 papyrus , which was not recycled , is from the @entity62 scientists used a controversial technique to recover the fragment of gospel			1
they used a method that glue used in the construction of mummy masks to be removed , without harming ink on papyrus			1
it does however , destroy the original artefact			0
scholars are debating whether the destruction of artefacts – even if they are not of museum quality – should be used			0
professor @entity41 said the technique is bringing lots of new texts to light and that it ’s not uncommon for over 24 to be recovered from just one mask			1
but archaeologists such as @entity84 have criticised the work on the gospel			0
‘ getting the mask off the wrapping was usually accompanied by the destruction of the whole mummy			0
now these guys with their atrocious accents and patronising attitudes are destroying what 's left to get their hands on trophy exhibits , ’ he wrote in a blog post			0
@entity98 , a lecturer in @entity99 and @entity100 at the @entity101 has criticised experts ’ speeches about the gospel at conferences in a blog post , saying they are ' not only misinformed , but can even encourage more people to buy mummy masks on the antiquities market and dissolve them in @entity111 soap			2
' the team was able to date the fragment of gospel by examining documents found in the same mask , which was destroyed because of the destructive nature of the technique			1
while some scholars have criticised the practice , professor @entity41 said that the mask in question was not museum quality and revealed interesting texts			2
the gospel according to @entity8 is the second , and shortest , book of the @entity128			2
it is thought that @entity8 wrote his gospel around the mid 60s @entity131 - about 30 years after the events he ’s describing			1
most scholars regard it as the earliest of the gospels and is the work of an unknown author			0
in the gospel , @entity8 tells of @entity140 ' ministry - from his baptism to his death and burial and the discovery of the empty tomb			2
however there is no birth narrative , nor any post-resurrection appearances			0
it portrays @entity140 as a hero , an exorcist , healer and miracle worker			0
@entity140 keeps his identity as messiah secret , concealing it in parables so that even the disciples fail to understand			0
all this is in keeping with prophecy , which foretold the fate of the messiah as ' @entity161 '			0
as well as studying the other documents used to make the mask , the experts dated the gospel fragment by examining the handwriting and using carbon dating			1
some scholars have criticised the practice of destroying masks made of papyrus ( an example is shown ) in order to recover the texts used to make them , but professor @entity41 says the ones he has worked on - and the one in which the fragment of gospel was found - are not of museum quality the gospel according to @entity8 is the second book of the @entity128			1

they think that it was written before the year 90 , but more information can not be shared until the text is published later this year , along with other papyrus pieces found in mummy masks			1
despite being small in size , experts claim the @entity220 fragment will provide clues as to whether the @entity8 has changed over the centuries			1
professor @entity41 is interested in how long the gospel papyrus was used before being transformed into part of a mask , because it could shed light on how biblical texts were copied over time			2
he explained : ‘ we have every reason to believe that the original writings and their earliest copies would have been in circulation for a hundred years in most cases - in some cases much longer , even 200 years			0
’ this means that a scribe copying a script in the third century , could , for example , work from an original written centuries before			0
the fragment of papyrus and other texts obtained from mummy masks will be published later this year .			1

scientists at @entity36 in @entity38 used a destructive technique to extract the fragment of papyrus from the mask
they did this by dissolving the glue in the papier - mâché creation
they say the small piece of material bears the @entity8
experts used carbon dating and *analysis* to date it to the first century ad
fragment and other texts found in masks will be published later this year
they include classical @entity48 texts , dated letters and business notes
