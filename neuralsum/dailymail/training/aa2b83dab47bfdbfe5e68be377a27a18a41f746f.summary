by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 pointed to another evening of frustration in front of goal as the main reason for @entity9 's @entity8 exit on tuesday night			1
the @entity9 were beaten on penalties by @entity12 side @entity11 having dominated for most of the 120 minutes leading to the shoot - out			1
summer signing @entity14 marked his full debut with the opening goal for @entity19 's side but @entity11 levelled when @entity20 scored an unfortunate second - half own goal			1
room for improvement : @entity2 ( right ) is frustrated with @entity9 missing opportunities to score good start : @entity9 players celebrate @entity14 's first goal for the club against @entity11 blades goalkeeper @entity30 was in inspired form to deny a string of @entity9 chances - and kept out @entity35 's penalty as the visitors secured a 5 - 4 shoot - out win			1
with 23 shots over the course of the night , @entity9 will feel they create plenty of opportunities to progress in a competition where they reached the semi-finals last year			1
it was a similar story on their defeat at home to @entity49 rivals @entity50 on the opening day of the @entity53 season and @entity2 knows that , with the help of new attacking coach @entity55 , the @entity9 must improve their conversion rate			1
' it 's a shame we did n't win this game at home , ' he said			2
' but we need to keep going now and focus on the league			0
we missed chances against @entity50 and did n't win the game , we took our chances against @entity64 and we won ( 3 - 1 )			1
' we have to keep focused and keep going			0
we 're doing great work with @entity55 in front of goal , so we have to keep working and try to score goals			1
' @entity19 's side are back at @entity70 in league action on saturday when they welcome @entity72 to east @entity49 , with @entity73 targeting a second win of the season			1
' every time we play at home we need to play for the three points , ' he added			0
' it 's going to be a big game because @entity72 are a good , strong team			2
i saw them against @entity83 and they played well			0
' we need to be ready for this game and make sure we take the three points			0
' key moment : @entity11 goalkeeper @entity30 saves @entity35 's penalty in the shootout delighted : @entity88 players congratulate @entity30 ( left ) after sealing their place in the @entity8 third round @entity11 captain @entity91 converted the winning penalty following @entity94 's miss - but @entity30 revealed he was eager to provide the heroics from the spot as well as on his goal - line			1
' i do fancy myself to be fair , ' he said			0
' i wanted to be in the top five ( penalty takers ) - it is another string to your bow			2
we all practice penalties in training before cup ties and i 'm no different , i like taking them as well as saving them			2
' former @entity109 trainee @entity30 also praised the work done by video analysts at the club to help secure progression into the third round			1
' i had done a bit of homework before , ' he said			0
' our video guys helped me out and they told me the right way to go for that one			0
it does help to do your homework			0
it is a great feeling but , overall with our grit and determination , i felt we deserved to win it			0
' the standard of our penalties was excellent			2
it is totally different for a goalkeeper , as an outfield player you can practice until the cows come home but it is a total different situation under the pressure			0
' as a goalkeeper you do n't feel that pressure - it just feels like someone wants to score past you			0
