by @entity0 published : 06:44 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 06:45 est , 18 october 2012 ' conspiracy ' victim : teacher @entity3 has fought to clear her name since she was sacked for allegedly miming a lewd act a science teacher who was sacked for allegedly miming a lewd act with a broomstick during class may have been set up by pupils in a conspiracy which turned into schoolyard ‘ folk history ’ , a judge has said			1
@entity3 was dismissed in 2006 after several pupils claimed that she simulated male masturbation , using a broom as a prop , while teaching them about the production of static electricity by friction at @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 in 2004			1
the former assistant head of science at the school has battled to clear her name ever since and yesterday , @entity28 judge @entity27 ruled that there was ‘ a considerable amount of evidence ’ that she had been an innocent victim of a ‘ conspiracy ’ among her pupils			1
he granted her permission to argue her case at the @entity37			1
outside court after the hearing @entity39 said : ‘ i know what 's gone on			1
‘ i 'm fed up with what 's happened to me			0
’ the teacher from @entity46 , in her 50s , was given a final warning over the incident in 2005 after ‘ a number of statements either in double figures or approaching double figures ’ were received by the school from pupils who said they had witnessed her demonstration			2
she was dismissed by local education authority , @entity58 , in 2006 for alleged misconduct with the broomstick allegation counting crucially against her			2
although miss @entity3 ' unfair dismissal claim was rejected last year by an @entity64 , which said the warning had been issued in good faith , her representative , @entity62 , told the judge there is powerful material contradicting the children 's story			1
that included records showing that she had in fact been teaching @entity76 on the critical day and attendance registers indicated that two of the pupils who made statements condemning her were actually absent from school at the time			1
mr @entity62 said : ‘ on that date , she provides something appropriate - which was a broom - to demonstrate @entity76			0
‘ she had taught the class static electricity on another day and the two lessons have been conflated together to make something salacious			0
’ the school had viewed the children 's evidence as overwhelming but attacking that conclusion was ‘ obviously wrong ’			0
he said : ‘ you have got statements from children not in the lesson and you 've got the lesson on the wrong day			0
’ justice @entity100 said that there was ‘ some possibility that there may have been some sort of conspiracy by the pupils to fabricate the incident ’			2
permission to plead : judge @entity27 said there was considerable evidence that pupils had conspired against her and he gave her ermission to argue her case at the @entity37 ( pictured ) he said : ‘ the school proceeded on the basis that the evidence from the children was so overwhelming that the new evidence could not be considered relevant			1
‘ the tribunal was satisfied that the final warning was given in good faith and had not been unfairly or improperly issued			0
it may well be that is a wholly sustainable conclusion			0
‘ however , i see some force in the submission that , where an employer has deliberately chosen to ignore evidence that , if it had been accepted , would wholly undermine what , on the face of it , would be powerful evidence of misconduct , in those circumstances perhaps the final warning ought to be construed as a nullity			0
‘ i am granting permission in this case			2
’ her case will now go ahead to a full @entity28 hearing .			0
