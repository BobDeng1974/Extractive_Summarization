the space shuttle @entity0 has been officially cleared for its final journey			1
officials at the @entity4 space agency have approved the craft for a cargo run to the @entity7 on july 8			1
the trip will be the final flight in @entity11 's 30 - year - old shuttle programme			1
lift - off of the shuttle , manned by a minimal crew of four astronauts , is set for 11.26am ( 3.26pm gmt ) from the @entity16 in @entity17			1
one more mission : @entity11 has approved shuttle @entity0 for a final run to the @entity7 on july 8 the 12 - day flight was added to the shuttle 's schedule last year to buy time in case @entity11 's newly hired cargo delivery companies have problems getting their spacecraft into orbit			1
@entity0 will be delivering a year 's worth of food , clothing , science equipment and supplies to the orbital outpost , a $ 100billion project of 16 nations that circles 220 miles ( 354 km ) above @entity36			2
' this flight is incredibly important to the space station			2
the cargo that is coming up on this flight is really mandatory , ' said @entity11 's spaceflight chief @entity41			0
earlier on tuesday , the threat of an orbital debris impact interrupted the station 's preparations for @entity0 ' visit			0
@entity11 learned that an unidentified piece of space debris was likely to pass close to the station and told the crew to seek shelter in the station 's two @entity54 @entity53 escape capsules			0
typically , the station manoeuvres to avoid potential debris impacts , but the notice came just 14 hours before the closest approach , too late to plan and conduct an avoidance manoeuvre			0
' we think it came within about 1,100ft of the space station			0
it was probably the closest object that 's actually come by the space station , ' @entity41 said			0
lift - off of the shuttle , manned by a minimal crew of four astronauts , is set for 11.26am ( 3.26pm gmt ) from the @entity16 in @entity17 final preparations : @entity0 astronauts @entity72 , @entity73 , commander @entity74 and @entity75 pose for the press last week the six station crew members divided into two groups of three and sealed themselves into the @entity53 capsules about 20 minutes before the object came closest to the station , which occurred at 8:08 a.m. edt ( 1208 gmt )			1
it was only the second time in the station 's history that crews had to seek shelter in their " lifeboats " for an orbital debris threat			0
the station 's two @entity4 crew members are preparing for a spacewalk during shuttle 's @entity0 ' eight - day stay , a job normally undertaken by the visiting astronauts			1
@entity11 , however , has been trying to keep the @entity0 crew 's training as simple as possible , as the four shuttle astronauts already are tasked to do the work of the six or seven people normally assigned to shuttle flights			1
the @entity4 space agency pared down the crew size to accommodate the smaller @entity54 soyuz spacecraft that would be used to fly the @entity0 astronauts home in case the shuttle is too damaged to attempt landing			1
long history : @entity0 in orbit , as seen from the @entity54 @entity110 in june 1995 soon - to - be - retired : @entity0 undocks from the @entity7 in september 2006 since the 2003 @entity112 accident , @entity11 has had a second shuttle on standby for a rescue mission if needed			2
@entity0 , however , is the 135th and last shuttle to fly , with no backup shuttle in waiting			2
the @entity4 is ending the shuttle programme to save its $ 4billion annual operating costs and use the money to develop spaceships that can travel beyond the station , such as to the moon , asteroids and eventually to @entity125			2
@entity126 and @entity127 are scheduled to begin cargo deliveries to the station next year			0
@entity11 is hoping commercial companies will be able to fly astronauts as well , though those spaceships are not expected to be ready for at least four to five years			0
meanwhile , @entity11 will pay @entity54 to fly its astronauts to the station at a cost of more than $ 50million per person .			0
