@entity0 believes @entity1 may not be the only rival @entity2 has to face as he looks to complete the career grand slam and add more majors to his collection			1
@entity2 's fourth place in the masters is his best finish in seven appearances , while his 12 under par total was 12 shots better than last year and beat his previous best by eight shots			1
but the world number one never threatened to claim a first green jacket to become only the sixth player in history to win all four major titles and saw @entity1 follow up his second place at @entity21 12 months ago with a record - breaking victory			1
@entity0 watches his tee shot on the fourth hole at @entity21 on friday @entity1 wears his green jacket after a sensational victory at the masters on sunday ' there are a lot of potential eras evolving , ' @entity0 said			1
' guys like @entity32 and @entity33 and @entity34			2
i feel like the young blood is certainly strong here in the @entity38 as opposed to the rest of the world			2
i feel like they certainly have the young potential coming through and it 's very good for the game			0
' when you look at @entity46 i think it makes it very interesting for them			0
i think our nucleus remains the same going forward but they have a lot of potential young blood coming through which could really change the shape of their team			0
' @entity1 and @entity2 are very difficult to compare because they are so different			1
i think it 's a good thing to see a guy coming through who is not @entity33 or @entity2 , guys like that who are dominating with physicality			2
@entity1 celebrates on the 18th green after sealing his maiden major at @entity67 @entity2 waves to the crowd by the 18th green as his bid to win all four major titles ended ' we see a guy coming around who is average build , average size , hits it average distance			1
he 's not short but he 's not the longest player on the planet and he gets it done other ways			0
' @entity1 was ranked 44th in driving distance with an average of 282 yards , with @entity33 ( 315 yards ) top and @entity2 seventh at 297 yards			1
' @entity2 's comparable to @entity87 but i do n't think @entity1 is necessarily comparable to @entity87 because of the way he plays the game , ' @entity0 added			1
' i think @entity1 is more comparable to a ( @entity92 ) @entity91 or someone like that which is pretty cool			2
' @entity32 walks off the second green after making a birdie putt during the third round on saturday @entity0 shows his frustrations after hitting an approach to the second green on friday @entity2 added : ' i played well			1
i can take a lot of positives from it			0
it is my best ever finish here			0
i played the last 45 holes in 15 under par. i did a lot of things i wanted to do			0
' i played the par - fives well ( 14 under )			2
just left myself too much to do after 27 holes of this golf tournament			0
forty on the front nine on friday , that really left me with an uphill battle			0
it was just great to get in for the weekend and made the most of a great finish on friday			0
