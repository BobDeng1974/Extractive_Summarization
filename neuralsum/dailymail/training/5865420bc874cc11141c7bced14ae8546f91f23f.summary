brief encounter : @entity1 with the @entity2 in 1982 it was a historic occasion as the @entity2 welcomed the first reigning @entity4 to visit @entity5 in 1982			1
but the visit of @entity1 – whose modernising style and charisma gave him ‘ pop star ’ like popularity – was dogged by bitter diplomatic wrangles over his meetings with @entity2 and @entity14			2
the @entity16 ’s reluctance to spend time with the @entity2 and the then prime minister sparked a row with ‘ high - handed ’ @entity21 officials , according to @entity23 papers obtained by @entity24 under freedom of information laws			1
a document from the run - up to the visit , dated december 15 , 1981 , reveals the concerns of the @entity4 ’s advisers			0
it states : ‘ as regards a call at the @entity39 , the @entity4 would be unlikely to accept an invitation to lunch with the @entity2			0
to do so could set an unwelcome precedent in that the @entity4 would be obliged to accept similar invitations for heads of state in whichever countries he visited			0
’ the @entity2 did meet the @entity4 during the six - day tour of @entity5 , but she had to be content with a 30 - minute private meeting which the @entity4 fitted in between public engagements on the day he arrived , may 28 , 1982			1
a meeting with mrs @entity14 proved even more problematic			2
at an early planning meeting the @entity23 was ‘ keen to put down a marker to the effect that the prime minister has expressed a desire to offer some sort of entertainment to the @entity4 ’			1
but the archbishop of westminster – one of @entity5 ’s most senior @entity53 – poured cold water on the idea			0
the minutes state : ‘ the archbishop emphasised the @entity4 would not wish to neglect any of the proper courtesies , but the programme was going to be extremely crowded			0
‘ he wondered whether the proper degree of contact could be achieved if she came to the reception he was to give on @entity64 and a room was provided where they could have a tete a tete meeting			0
’ the @entity16 ’s reluctance to spend time with the @entity2 and @entity14 during the visit , pictured , sparked a row with ‘ high - handed ’ @entity21 officials , according to @entity23 papers mrs @entity14 feared the lack of a formal private meeting would be seen as a snub , a @entity23 memo from november 20 , 1981 reveals , saying : ‘ the prime minister would think it was liable to excite adverse comment if contact between her and the @entity4 were limited to a handshake during a large reception			1
’ one memo in the files states : ‘ concerned to hear of some evidence of high - handedness in @entity4 entourage			1
’ the documents from 1981 do not detail why the @entity4 may have been reluctant to meet the prime minister , although one memo refers to ‘ current @entity94 developments ’			2
it is known that the @entity4 was concerned about the treatment of the @entity98 hunger strikers who were protesting in 1981 .			0

@entity1 visited the @entity2 in 1982 for 30 minutes during six - day visit
@entity4 reluctant for meeting *incase* it set precedent for other heads of states
meeting with the then prime minister @entity14 also proved problematic
