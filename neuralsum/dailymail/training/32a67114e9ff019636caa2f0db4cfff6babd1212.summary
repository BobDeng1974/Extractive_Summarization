by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 11:21 est , 30 august 2013 scientists have captured the remarkable moment a boa constrictor attacked a fully - grown howler monkey to claim it as a substantial snack			1
the incident , which took place deep in the @entity9 rainforest in @entity10 , is rare , as monkeys are usually adept at protecting themselves from predators			1
but the video shows the huge snake crushing the hapless monkey before swallowing it whole			0
the video has caused scientists to rethink how vulnerable primates can be to skilled predators like the boa constrictor , that usually stick to smaller meals like rodents and birds , @entity18 reported			1
here the female howler monkeys clings to a branch in a futile attempt to pull herself from the crushing jaws of the snake @entity40 - @entity39 , a researcher at @entity38 , said the female @entity42 red howler monkey did not see the snake lying in wait in the tree			1
in the study , published in the journal @entity47 , dr @entity39 suggests snakes prey on more @entity51 monkeys than was previously thought			0
commenting on the study , @entity52 , a primatologist at the @entity53 said it is known that snakes , raptors and big cats do attack monkeys but filming macabre spectacle is very rare			2
the monkeys , which have good vision , usually defend themselves by living in groups and collectively keeping an eye out for threats			0
but the unfortunate monkey in the film broke away from her group of five in the @entity9 jungle before meeting the snake			2
the boa constrictor reportedly struck at the monkey and swiftly wrapped it in a death - grip by coiling its muscular body around the monkey , which tried to free itself by gripping a tree , but was crushed			1
the snake lay in wait crouched in a tree while the female monkey broke away from her group			0
the boa constrictor struck the monkey before crushing it with its powerful muscles			1
here , the dead monkey is being swallowed head - first by the snake the snake 's attack was typical , according to experts			0
it crouched in once place , camouflaged in the foliage to wait for its next meal			0
boa constrictors are so patient they have been known to wait in one spot for around one month			0
the female monkey was followed by a companion who was unable to save her friend from the powerful snake , despite hitting it several times			0
defeated , the healthy monkey retreated , leaving the boa constrictor to swallow her crushed friend head - first over a period of just over one hour			1
the video shows the snake using its muscles to swallow the bulky monkey , which is thought to weigh around six kilogrammes - and then a rather huge bulge in its belly			2
primatologist dr @entity52 believes the monkey might have avoided being eaten if it had of stayed with its group , adding : ' being a solitary monkey is definitely not a good thing '			1
the monkey - shaped bulge is clearly visible in the snake 's stomach dr @entity39 told @entity18 : ' according to observations on predation attempts on howler monkeys made by other researchers , howlers often do n't do anything to defend the victim			2
' dr @entity52 believes the monkey might have avoided being eaten if it had of stayed with its group , adding : ' being a solitary monkey is definitely not a good thing '			2
the researcher claims it is the first time that a terrifying attack of this type has been caught on camera , although recent studies have found more rare types of primate predation , including a leopard eating a chimpanzee .			0

@entity40 - @entity39 , a researcher at @entity149 witnessed the incident in the @entity9 rainforest
the video has caused scientists to rethink how vulnerable primates can be to skilled predators like the boa constrictor
primatologist @entity52 said the monkey might have *escaped* its fate if it had stayed with its group
