by @entity0 published : 16:50 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 18:39 est , 9 october 2013 ministers are drawing up secret plans to sweep away energy quangocrats appointed by @entity4 in an increasingly bitter battle over how best to keep down spiralling gas and electricity bills			2
the plan to shake up energy regulator @entity10 comes as the @entity11 seek to up the pressure on the @entity14 leader , blaming him for price rises that have hit consumers in recent years			1
senior tories also want to rein in some of the green levies that mr @entity4 introduced as energy secretary to help cut prices , though they face a fierce battle with their @entity24 coalition colleagues			1
energy minister @entity25 , left , is drawing up secret plans to sweep away energy quangocrats appointed by @entity4 @entity27 told @entity28 yesterday that mr @entity4 ’s pledge to freeze energy prices for 20 months if he wins the next election is nothing more than a gimmick , claiming his plans to set yet more environmental targets would add £ 125 a year on to bills			1
the @entity37 has learned that energy minister @entity25 is now preparing plans for a fundamental overhaul of @entity10 , which has been criticised for failing to get tough with the big six energy companies as they have hiked up prices			1
government sources said that six of the nine current members of the @entity10 board were appointed by the last government , and only one has a consumer background			1
those appointed by mr @entity4 when he was energy secretary include @entity50 , formerly at the @entity51 ; @entity52 , former departmental chief scientist at the then @entity53 ; @entity54 , former non-executive director at the @entity55 and director at @entity57 and @entity58 , former director of corporate affairs at @entity10 and previously at telephone services regulator @entity60			1
the @entity14 leader has now pledged to scrap @entity10 and replace it with a new regulator			1
but one @entity64 source said : ‘ @entity4 appears to be saying he does n’t trust his own judgement and now wants to change the nameplate on the door of @entity10			1
we need to sweep away all of the @entity14 appointees and bring in people that actually understand the consumer			2
‘ they are in the main professional quangocrats and industry insiders			0
when @entity4 had the chance , as energy secretary under the last government , he did absolutely nothing to advance the interests of the people paying energy bills			2
‘ we need people from which ? , people with a supermarket background , people who ’ve worked at the retail end of the sector			0
we do n’t need technocrats , we need people who will really take action			0
’ in the @entity94 , the prime minister attacked mr @entity4 ’s promise to freeze prices for 20 months after the next general election , telling mps that even the @entity14 leader admitted he may not be able to keep to his commitment because no government could control the wholesale energy markets			1
he claimed that if mr @entity4 did introduce the price freeze , it would only lead to higher energy costs for households and businesses in the long - term			2
‘ this is n’t a policy , it ’s a gimmick and the reason it ’s a gimmick is that you are in favour of a decarbonisation target that would add £ 125 to everybody ’s bill			0
it is obvious why you want to talk about the cost of living , because you do not have an economic policy			0
‘ energy prices doubled under @entity14 , electricity prices went up by 50 per cent			1
and let me say this to you - there is one thing governments ca n’t control and that is the international wholesale price of gas			0
‘ i know you would like to live in some sort of @entity134 universe where you can control all of these things but you need a basic lesson in economics			0
’ prime minister @entity27 told mr @entity4 he needs a ' basic lesson in economics ' mr @entity4 insisted the government had no answer to @entity14 ’s policy to freeze energy prices , which was unveiled last month at the party ’s conference in @entity146			1
the @entity14 leader said the government ’s policy to force firms to switch consumers to the lowest energy tariff would not help 90 per cent of the population because it would only apply to those on so - called ‘ closed tariffs ’ , those that are no longer available			1
he told mr @entity27 : ‘ what is clear is that you are floundering around and you have no answer to @entity14 ’s energy price freeze			1
you say you want to bring energy prices down but can you confirm that energy prices have gone up by £ 300 since you became prime minister ? ‘ we have a cost of living crisis in this country			1
energy bills are rising and you support energy companies and not the consumer			2
we have a prime minister who always stands up for the wrong people			1
’ mr @entity27 replied by reviving the @entity11 ’ 1992 election warning that a @entity14 victory would mean tax rises and higher mortgage bills : ‘ we know what your cost of living policy is			2
it is more spending , more borrowing and more debt and that would lead to higher taxes and higher mortgage rates			0
that is the double - whammy that would hit every family in this country			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity188 claimed mr @entity4 ’s figures were ‘ misleading ’			0
‘ before the end of the year , energy suppliers will be forced to offer no more than four core tariffs per fuel , ’ he said			0
‘ as these changes take effect , more people will be on tariffs closed to new customers , and suppliers will need to move these customers on to the best deal for their preferences			0
‘ suppliers will also be required to tell all their own customers if there is a cheaper tariff for them , and people will benefit from clearer information to help them compare and switch suppliers			0
’ the government is preparing further measures on the cost of living in the coming weeks			0
yesterday , ministers promised to cap rail fare increases and there is speculation that they may order a real - terms freeze next year			0
other proposals to limit bank charges and water bills are expected			0
an @entity10 spokesman said : ‘ we do not comment on speculation			2
