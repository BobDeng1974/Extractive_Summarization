by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:00 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 06:13 est , 29 may 2013 ministers resisting to billions of pounds in budget cuts will be shamed into explaining themselves to a medieval - style @entity4			1
chancellor @entity5 will convene the panel of senior figures who have agreed a fresh round of spending cuts to put pressure on those grill the departments who refuse to fall into line			1
one of those likely to face the @entity4 , defence secretary @entity15 , today signalleed that he is ready to block cuts which threaten @entity19 ’s ‘ military capabilities ’ risking a new @entity22 stand - off with the @entity21			1
@entity4 : ministers who refuse to sign up to new spending cuts will be dragged to face @entity26 colleagues to explain themselves in at a hearing modeller on the @entity29 courts which held the rich and powerful to account write caption here ministers have been told to help find £ 11.5billion in extra savings for 2015 - 16			1
so far he has raised of £ 2.5billion , after seven departments including justice , energy and the @entity38 signed off cuts of up to 10 per cent			1
but big spending ministers , including mr @entity15 , home secretary @entity41 , business secretary @entity42 and environment secretary @entity43 are resisting demands for the deepest cuts			1
they all faced being hauled before the @entity4 – officially called the @entity47 – to be cross-examined by ministers who have already settled their budgets with the @entity21			2
mr @entity5 insisted he would not let ministers ‘ off the hook ’ by calling for more benefits cuts instead of adjusting their own spending			1
at risk : defence secretary @entity15 warned @entity19 's ' military capabilities ' would be at risk if @entity21 demands for cuts went beyond efficiency savings but mr @entity15 risked the ire of the chancellor when he refused to offer cuts to the armed forces beyond efficiency savings in the way the @entity66 is run			1
mr @entity15 said : ‘ we can look for efficiency savings , which everybody should be seeking all the time and however many times you 've done it you can always go back and have another look			1
the threat of the @entity4 for ministers who refuse to sign up to cuts is real - and has worked in the past			2
in 2010 , @entity5 warned those dragging their feet that they would be grilled by @entity26 colleagues and they all fell into line			2
this time tensions are higher and ministers who agreed cuts last time are not more reluctant			1
the idea of a @entity4 dates back to the 15th century , and was a court of justice which sat in the @entity90			0
it took its name from stars painted on the ceiling of the room built during the rein of @entity98 it was made up of @entity100 and judges and sat in judgement on people considered too powerful and prominent to be dealt with by ordinary courts			0
it sat in secret with no witnesses , and was often used and abused by the monarchy to target enemies			0
mr @entity5 's @entity4 , more dryly named the @entity47 the @entity4 will meet in the @entity110			2
a source said : ‘ the room was purpose built as the @entity21 board room in the 1750s			0
' throughout its history , the role of the @entity117 has been to approve expenditure , grants , fines and taxes			0
' ‘ but we should be very clear that there is a difference between efficiency savings , which may be difficult to achieve but are painless in terms of the impact on the front line , and output cuts , which are of a very different order and require proper and mature consideration across government about the impact that they will have on our military capabilities			1
’ he said he was ready to have an ‘ adult conversation ’ about ‘ what we reasonably can do ’ in terms of efficiency savings in his department			1
the @entity21 hopes that just the threat of having to appear at the @entity4 will embarrass ministers into agreeing cuts			2
during the @entity148 all government departments chose to settle their budgets rather than be grilled by @entity26 colleagues			2
but the negotiations have been more fraught this time round , with some ministers angry that they are being cut again while the @entity153 , international aid , defence equipment and schools budgets remain protected			2
each cabinet minister is expected to agree their cuts with the @entity21 directly			0
those that refuse will have to appear in front of the @entity47 , which is chaired by mr @entity5 and @entity163 , the chief secretary to the treasury			2
yesterday it emerged that seven departments had agreed cuts worth £ 1billion , including the @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity38 , @entity170 , @entity171 , the @entity21 and the @entity110			1
the cuts amount to almost 10 per cent of their combined budgets , higher than the eight per cent targeted by the spending review as a whole			0
as a result the minister in charge - @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 – have been invited to join the @entity4			0
@entity185 and @entity186 have also been invited to join			0
it is expected to meet at least twice in the final weeks of the spending review , before mr @entity5 makes a statement to @entity190 on june 26			0
the chancellor is understood to be delighted that seven departments have already signed off savings of up to 10 per cent , including justice secretary @entity179 and communities secretary @entity182 who were reported to be resisting cuts			1
a @entity21 source said : ' we are impress by @entity182 and @entity179			0
clearly these are ministers who have put their money where their mouth is and are very serious about making sure every penny of taxpayers ' money is spent effectively			0
' praise : justice secretary @entity179 and communities secretary @entity182 have been invited to join the @entity4 after ' putting their money where their mouth is ' to agree to cuts of up to 10 per cent however , mr @entity5 has made clear to other ministers yet to settle cuts will that he will not be diverted by calls for more benefits cuts			1
the benefits cap , announced last year limiting increases in working age benefits to one per cent , is already due to raise £ 3.4billion in 2015 - 16			1
mr @entity5 said : ' we are cutting welfare and we ’re cutting welfare for the future as well			0
‘ we ’re going to make sure that no family that stays at home on benefits gets more than the average family going out to work and we ’re also making sure that welfare bills do n’t go up faster than wages , so there are big savings in welfare			0
‘ but i would also say that ’s not an excuse to let @entity22 off the hook			0
' we ’ve also got to make savings there so we can fix our economy , bring that deficit down and spend on the things people want us to spend on like the @entity153 , like the infrastructure that ’s going to create jobs in the future			0
’ several @entity238 ministers have called for deeper cuts to benefits to help balance the books .			0

@entity5 invites ministers who have agreed to cuts to sit in judgement on colleagues
7 out of *24* departments have settled budgets but chancellor needs to find £ *9billion* for 2015 - 16
defence secretary @entity15 says he will accept ' reasonable ' efficiency savings but not cuts which hit the *frontline*
