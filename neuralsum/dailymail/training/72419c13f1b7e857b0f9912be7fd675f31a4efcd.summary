by @entity0 published : 04:22 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 04:34 est , 19 june 2013 as a country , @entity1 is used to dealing with huge fires wreaking devastation across its communities			0
so you can only imagine how @entity8 residents felt when they woke one morning to see this image across the city			2
with billowing smoke and a bright orange glow behind skyscrapers , the city looks like it is in the grip of an enormous fire			1
scary : at first glance , this looks like @entity8 could be in the grip of a huge fire however , thankfully , rather than being a huge blaze , it was actually an early morning sunrise			1
as the bright sunlight rose high above the city it shone directly into a blanket of thick fog causing it to glow a deep shade of orange			1
but with the fog rapidly moving across the skyline it created the illusion that a fire was raging through @entity8 - prompting panic among people awake early enough to witness the stunning sight			2
keen photographer @entity39 , 23 , snapped these incredible images from the balcony of his apartment in the @entity8 central business district after realising he was in no danger			2
mr @entity39 , a student at the @entity45 , said : ' i took these images at about 7am - it was just as the sun was beginning to break and start making its way up the buildings			0
good news : however , instead of being a fire , it was actually a bright early morning sunrise which shone directly into a blanket of thick fog ' i was working at my computer when i saw this out of the corner of my eye through the blinds of my window			1
' immediately i thought it was a fire , so i jumped out of my seat and rushed to the balcony to figure out what was going on			0
' the sky was like that for about 10 minutes until the sun got to a point where it was n't making the fog orange in that way			0
' there have been a few days of heavy fog recently but i 've never seen anything that looked like that - i was genuinely worried one of the high - rise buildings was on fire it was crazy			0
