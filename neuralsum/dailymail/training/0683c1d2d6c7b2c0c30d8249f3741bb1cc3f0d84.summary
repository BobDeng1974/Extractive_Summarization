a pregnant mother whose unborn child has been diagnosed with a tumour is to carry on with her pregnancy - despite being told the baby has just one per cent chance of survival			1
@entity7 , 22 , was devastated after doctors broke the news at her 20 - week scan that her baby had a 10p - sized tumour at the top of one kidney			1
she was told she could terminate the pregnancy , but decided to not to despite the poor prognosis - and is now six months pregnant			1
@entity7 , 22 , has been told her unborn baby has just a one per cent chance of survival because it has a kidney tumour but she has decided to continue with the pregnancy the only hope the family have of realistically saving the unborn child is expensive laser surgery , carried out in the womb by surgeons at a specialist hospital in the @entity26 - at a cost of £ 300,000			1
ms @entity7 , from @entity28 , @entity29 , who also has a three - year - old daughter , @entity30 , said : ' i broke down when they told us , but this baby deserves a chance to live			1
' a consultant told me the baby was very ill and that it had a one per cent chance of survival			2
' a lot of people are telling me to get rid of it , but it deserves a chance			2
i do n’t think they would understand unless they go through it themselves			0
' the pregnancy was developing without problems until doctors at @entity52 , @entity53 , discovered the baby had fluid in its stomach at the crucial 20 - week scan			1
ms @entity7 was sent to @entity58 and then referred to the @entity59 in @entity60 , where she was kept in for further tests			1
ms @entity7 has been told the only chance of saving the baby is pre-natal surgery which costs £ 300,000 doctors feared her baby might have caught a virus and needed a blood transfusion , but the results came back negative			1
ms @entity7 was then given an ultrasound scan , but when the sonographer stopped half - way through the scan she knew something was wrong			1
she said : ' they were scanning me and i could n’t see the screen			0
the nurse got her colleague			0
' she had a look and then she stopped scanning			0
i was asking , " what ’s wrong ? " it was clear in the scan			0
it was about the size of a 10p piece			0
' they did say the baby is very ill and it might not survive in the womb or after i have given birth			0
' ms @entity7 is now trying to raise the money required to go to the @entity26 for surgery in a bid to save the baby			1
image shows the scan prior to that which revealed the tumour although she is in her sixth month , it is still unclear what the baby ’s gender is or whether the tumour is cancerous or just a mass of tissue			2
doctors are worried that it could be neuroblastoma - an aggressive form of childhood cancer			2
ms @entity7 and the baby ’s father , @entity111 , 21 , have separated , but they are supporting each other through the ordeal			1
mr @entity111 said : ' it ’s not hit me as much as my mum and @entity7			2
i do n’t think it ’s sunk in yet , not for me , anyway			0
' the family has been desperately researching the condition and have contacted experts at @entity122 in @entity26 , who could perform laser treatment on the tumour			2
the hospital is home to the world ’s largest research enterprise at a paediatric medical centre , and could perform pre-natal surgery			1
ms @entity7 ( pictured with the baby 's father , @entity111 , 21 ) said : ' i broke down when they told us , but this baby deserves a chance to live ' but the family has only three months left and they say they need to raise a staggering £ 300,000 to pay for the flights and the overseas treatment			1
mr @entity111 ’s mother , @entity142 , who has supported ms @entity7 throughout the pregnancy , said : ' @entity7 is distressed			1
the hospital is being very helpful			0
' we have been speaking to a representative there , which is the same as a consultant here			0
' we are doing research and getting information			0
no - one seems to know what it is			0
it would be great to find someone else in the @entity157 that will know what it ’s like			0
' the family have also launched an appeal for the cause - which they have called @entity165 , our little braveheart			0
the family have organised several fundraising events and are urging readers touched by their story to come forward and help			0
ms @entity142 added : ' we have not got that much time			2
but if anything happens before we manage to get to @entity26 , i ’m going to put the money towards somebody else in a similar situation			2

@entity7 was told at her 20 - week scan the baby has a kidney tumour
she was told she could terminate the pregnancy but chose not to
doctors say the only chance of saving the baby is pre-natal surgery
this would have to take place at a specialist centre in the @entity26
ms @entity7 is now trying to raise the money needed for the treatment
she is already six months pregnant , so time is running out
