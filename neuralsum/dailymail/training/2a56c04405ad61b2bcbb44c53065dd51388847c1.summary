by @entity0 published : 17:34 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 17:39 est , 29 april 2013 men who are obese in their early twenties are significantly less likely to live to reach middle age , according to a new study published in the @entity5			2
they are also up to eight times more likely to suffer diabetes , potentially fatal blood clots or a heart attack			1
it is well known that obesity in adulthood poses a risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease , but previously it had not been clear whether obesity in early adulthood strengthens that risk			1
men who are obese in their twenties are eight times more likely to suffer diabetes , potentially fatal blood clots or a heart attack @entity24 researchers tracked the health of 6,500 @entity24 22 - year - old men for 33 years up to the age of 55			1
all the men were born in 1955 and had registered with the @entity29 for a fitness test to gauge their suitability for military service			0
all potential conscripts in @entity24 are subjected to a battery of psychological and physical tests , including weight			1
over 80 per cent were within the normal range and five per cent were underweight			0
one in 10 were overweight and just over one per cent - equating to 97 men - were obese			1
normal weight is classified as a body mass index ( @entity42 ) of between 18.5 and 25 ; obesity is classified as a @entity42 of 30 or more			0
almost half of those classified as obese at the age of 22 were diagnosed with diabetes , high blood pressure , heart attack , stroke , blood clots in the legs or lungs , or had died before reaching the age of 55			2
they were eight times more likely to get diabetes as their normal weight peers and four times as likely to get a potentially fatal blood clot			0
the study found that youth provides no protection against the dangers of carrying excess weight they were also more than twice as likely to develop high blood pressure , have had a heart attack , or to have died			0
every unit increase in @entity42 corresponded to an increased heart attack rate of five per cent , high blood pressure and blood clot rates of 10 per cent , and an increased diabetes rate of 20 per cent			2
in total , obese young men were three times as likely to get any of these serious conditions as their normal weight peers by middle age , conferring an absolute risk of almost 50 per cent compared with only 20 per cent among their normal weight peers			0
the findings , published in the @entity5 , have prompted researchers to warn that the continuing rise in obesity may counteract the fall in deaths from heart disease			1
they said : ' obesity - related morbidity and mortality will , in decades to come , place an unprecedented burden on healthcare systems worldwide			0

has been known for some time that being overweight increases risk of diabetes and heart disease
but @entity24 research has shown that being overweight in twenties has long - term *detrimental* effect on health
