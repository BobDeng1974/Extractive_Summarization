@entity0 cruised into the fourth round of the @entity2 as a fans protest resulted in a paltry home crowd			1
goals from @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 put the @entity9 into the hat for the next round as they eased past @entity13 strugglers @entity12			1
former @entity15 striker @entity14 grabbed a consolation for the visitors , but it was the sparse attendance which was the main talking point			1
it marked the lowest @entity9 crowd since they moved from @entity82 to their new home in 2009			1
it made for an eerie atmosphere , and did little to help a home side struggling for confidence after a miserable recent run that had seen them ship 13 goals in four games			0
@entity0 manager @entity92 said of the poor attendance : ' i ca n’t make people come and watch the team			2
' i am sure if we start winning football matches and get some momentum from this game then people will come back			0
' but it is difficult for the players			0
you would n’t want to see this for a league game as you want an atmosphere and for it to be very difficult for the opposition when they come here			0
' but there are factors i can not control			0
' there was little for either goalkeeper to do until @entity0 took the lead in the 34th minute			2
@entity55 ’s poor clearing header fell to @entity43 on the edge of the area and the midfielder found the net in fortuitous fashion			0
his initial strike was on target , but would not have beaten @entity12 keeper @entity51 without deflections off both @entity52 and @entity123			2
@entity38 went close to doubling their lead as he dispossessed @entity126 and drove towards goal , only to see his low shot tipped round the post by the scurrying @entity51			2
@entity0 goalkeeper @entity34 dives to his right to deny @entity12 's @entity61 @entity58 almost atoned for his error instantly			1
his foraging run down the left took him to the edge of the @entity0 box where his clever lay - off found @entity61			0
the striker looked certain to level but a superb full - length stop from @entity34 preserved @entity0 ’s lead			0
the miss proved costly to @entity12 ’s hopes of an upset and @entity0 moved further ahead eight minutes into the second half			1
@entity7 improvised brilliantly to dispatch an acrobatic volley into the bottom corner for his first @entity0 goal after @entity25 had headed a @entity39 corner straight up in the air			1
@entity39 set up the third on the hour , his pin - point delivery allowed @entity8 to head home with his first touch after coming on as a substitute			0
@entity14 got @entity12 the consolation their visitors deserved as he calmly slotted home his 13th goal of the season from @entity61 ’s lay - off , but it was too little too late .			1

@entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 netted for @entity0
@entity14 scored consolation goal for @entity13 outfit @entity12
@entity0 become first side to reach the fourth round of the @entity2
@entity9 victory was watched by lowest crowd at @entity31
