by @entity1 reporter last updated at 2:24 pm on 18th june 2011 presenting himself as a real - life castaway , @entity2 said he had spent the last 26 years living in a driftwood shack by one of the @entity8 's most remote beaches			1
but it has now emerged that the 63 - year - old 's @entity11 - style tale may not have been quite as it seemed			1
according to his sister , he actually spent a lot of his time living in his mother 's house before she died and now still stays with family or friends when it gets cold			1
for sale : the terraced home where castaway @entity2 stayed regularly with his mother @entity24 simple life : the 63 - year - old has lived in this remote driftwood shack in @entity28 for the past 26 years just the basics : the shack has no electricity , with mr @entity2 doing most of his cooking over an open fire mr @entity2 had his own room at the terraced home in @entity36 , @entity37 , of his widowed mother @entity24 and kept clothes and other possessions there			1
he has said he sleeps on a mattress of dried leaves under a blue tarpaulin every night at the tumbledown remains of a 17th century bark drying house in @entity48 near @entity49 , @entity28			2
but his sister @entity50 , who stands to inherit a half - share of the £ 140,000 house which is up for sale , told the @entity53 her brother often stays with her			1
she said : ' he stays at his cabin off and on and at other times stays with friends or comes here			1
he likes his lifestyle out in the open , but it gets very cold up there in winter			2
he 's got lots of friends wherever he goes and stays wherever he lays his hat			1
' and one of @entity24 ' former neighbours added : ' @entity2 thought a lot of his mum and would come and stay with her all the time			2
' enjoying the high life : @entity2 had his first taste of champagne after leaving the remote shack he calls home for a tour of @entity36 no expense spared : during his trip to @entity36 mr @entity2 sipped champagne worth over £ 45 a bottle ' unbelievable prices ' : the real - life @entity11 shops in @entity81 as he enjoys a taste of civilisation - but was shocked by how much the food cost getting to grips with his trolley : not his usual outlet for food supplies - and , right , mr @entity2 gets his first - ever suit - fitting at @entity90 in @entity36 earlier this week @entity2 had a taste of the outside world - including his first ever sip of champagne			1
among the novelties he experienced in @entity36 , included listening to an ' amazing ' @entity96 , sitting in a @entity97 , having a suit - fitting and an ' unbelievable ' visit to @entity81			1
the divorced father - of - one joined suited businessmen and smartly dressed couples , as he enjoyed an expensive lunch at @entity105 - starred chef @entity104 ' restaurant at the city 's plush @entity107 - and sipped champagne priced at £ 47.25 a bottle			1
' this is absolutely lovely , i feel like a celebrity , ' @entity2 said			2
' it has simply never occurred to me to order champagne before , i 'm happy with orange juice and water			1
' i feel like @entity117 ' : @entity2 tries out a @entity119 convertible worth £ 160,000 thinking ahead : ' i 'd need a car i could sleep in the back of , ' said @entity122 ' it 's a very nice treat but i am not sure it is worth £ 50 - that 's my food budget for a month			1
i 'm definitely telling my son about this , he wo n't believe it			2
i prefer sitting out by the sea and cooking soup over an open fire			2
' mr @entity2 then ordered a £ 24 lunch of pan-fried @entity37 sea bass , which came with fennel puree , confit tomato , fennel cream and a rich fish red wine sauce			2
he said , ' that 's a very small portion for the money			1
it hardly seems worth it			2
it is absolutely beautiful though , i have n't eaten food like this for years			2
i usually have nettle soup or shellfish and seaweed so this is a real change			0
' mr @entity2 - who has been divorced from his wife for 33 years - said he could be convinced to dine out more but only if he found his very own ' girl friday '			0
continuing his tour , he then visited a @entity81 for the first time , where he joked with staff that he fancied a ' nice young bird ' to take home and said he could not believe the prices of items on the carefully stocked shelves			1
' i ca n't believe the amount of food on offer here and all of the places it comes from , ' mr @entity2 said			0
' if i need to shop , i go to local organic stores where most of the produce is local			0
all of this is very @entity167 are so many ready meals too			0
i do n't have electricity at home , let alone a microwave			1
' i do n't suppose you could cook them over an open fire because all the plastic would melt			0
' mr @entity2 also went for his first - ever suit fitting at @entity90 in @entity36 , who measured him up for a neat new outfit			1
he kept his battered brown hat on , along with scruffy jeans and a flowing velvet scarf , as he examined the suits			0
his favourite was a smart @entity185 outfit , costing a cool £ 279 , but also liked a @entity90 £ 129 version			0
sparsely furnished : mr @entity2 sleeps on a mattress of dried leaves under a blue tarpaulin hidden away : the shack is so remote that it is an hour 's walk away from the nearest road mr @entity2 said : ' these suits do look very smart but i am happy in my own clothes			1
' i always shop at charity shops - you can pick up some real bargains there			0
' and @entity2 beamed with excitement as he tried out a @entity119 convertible - worth an eye - watering £ 160,000			0
he carefully sat inside the cream - coloured car - which boasts a 4.3 litre v8 engine - at @entity204 in @entity36			1
manager @entity205 showed him how to work the convertible 's impressive on - board computer and gave him a tour of the fleet of @entity211 and @entity212 at the dealership			1
long time hidden : mr @entity2 first moved in to the beachside shack in the 1980s mr @entity2 said : ' gosh , i feel like @entity117 sat in here			0
i had a horse and carriage when i was in my 40s and 50s as i worked in a gypsy museum in @entity28			0
' i imagine this would be a bit quicker though			0
' i do n't really like driving to be honest , i find the traffic too stressful			0
i would n't even think about buying the @entity97 , it 's not for me			1
ear we go : @entity2 spent half an hour carefully studying computers , iphones and @entity230 , which he admitted he was ' bemused ' by ' i 'd need a car i could sleep in the back of , it would be my dream to have a camper van			2
' i feel pretty awkward sat in this , i 'm worried i 'm going to break it			0
' he also told of his shock as he tried out an ' amazing ' @entity96 for the first time - as he visited the smart @entity240 in @entity36 , @entity37 , which stocks the latest technology from the iconic brand			1
he spent half an hour carefully studying computers , iphones and @entity230 , which he admitted he was ' bemused ' by			0
mr @entity2 said : ' everyone is always saying that i should get a computer but i 've never had one			0
' i do n't really see the point			0
these things all look very smart but they are nothing compared to the view i get when i look out to the sea			0
' i suppose if i went abroad to work on an organic farm then i might get an email address to keep in touch with people			0
' i 've never seen anything like this before , it really is amazing			0
it 's certainly opened my eyes to new things			2
' mr @entity2 began building his idyllic home in 1985.the woodland site is an hour 's walk from the nearest road down a treacherous path and only a handful of people knew of his existence - until now			1
but he could be forced to leave his beachfront paradise after bosses at @entity271 threatened to evict him			0
he is now awaiting a decision from park chiefs as they decide his fate .			0
