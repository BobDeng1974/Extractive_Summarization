journalist @entity0 suffered horrifying torture at the hands of his @entity4 captors before they killed him , including waterboarding , virtual starvation and being hung upside - down by his ankles			1
@entity0 , 40 , was killed in a graphic propaganda video released in august by the terrorist organization , which calls itself the @entity10 - but new details from his two years in captivity are still emerging			1
fellow captives have now spoken out about their time in prison with @entity0 , whom they referred to as a pillar of strength			2
they revealed that he received the most brutal treatment out of dozens of hostages because he was @entity19			1
as the group gained strength , his treatment worsened , according to a lengthy account of his capture and captivity published by the @entity36			2
as early as august 2013 - before @entity4 caught the world 's attention with its huge land grab in @entity40 would regularly be lashed to a metal bar by the ankles and left dangling from the ceiling for hours			1
this element of his torture was revealed by @entity46 , a 19 - year - old @entity47 who shared a cell with him			0
he told the @entity36 : ' you could see the scars on his ankles			0
he told me how they had chained his feet to a bar and then hung the bar so that he was upside down from the ceiling			2
' grabbed by the border : @entity0 was seized by jihadists near the @entity27 border with @entity28			1
the group was took him later swore fealty to @entity4 , which now calls itself the @entity10 later , after @entity0 was handed over to a central @entity4 prison in @entity27 , with dozens of other captives , the torture became more targeted and extreme			1
initially dozens of @entity67 captives were held together , but @entity4 began to release those whose governments would pay large ransoms for them			1
eventually only @entity72 and @entity19 - whose governments refuse to pay out - were left , and the regime grew harsher			1
former cellmates have said that @entity0 was routinely the victim of mock executions - and even waterboarding			2
one told how when @entity0 was taken from his cell by his captors , they would pray for him to return covered in blood , as if he was unmarked it would be a sign of even more savage treatments , such as the waterboarding technique , which simulates drowning			2
working : @entity0 is pictured above filming in @entity83 , @entity84 , in 2011 @entity4 has said they employ that form of torture as a direct response to the @entity19 government 's waterboarding of @entity92 captives as part of the war on terror			1
in particularly bleak periods of captivity , the prisoners would also be practically starved , given the equivalent of a teacup full of food every day			0
as the prisoners were often kept in almost total darkness , they would often spill what little food they had as they attempted to eat			0
torture : @entity4 has said it uses waterboarding because the @entity19 did in the @entity108			1
pictured is an example waterboard at a torture museum despite all this , @entity0 would share his limited rations with other captives , and gave up his blanket to somebody else in the depths of winter , other prisoners said			2
in a letter to @entity0 's family smuggled out by a fellow captive , he gives a more positive outlook of his captivity , and makes no mention of torture			1
he wrote : ' i have had weak and strong days			0
we are so grateful when anyone is freed ; but of course , yearn for our own freedom			0
we try to encourage each other and share strength			0
threats : @entity4 released the videos showing the deaths of captives such as @entity0 , pictured above			1
they have been exclusively from the @entity72 and the @entity19 - whose governments do not pay ransoms ' we are being fed better now and daily			1
we have tea , occasional coffee			0
i have regained most of my weight lost last year			0
' however , the letter implies that he has an inkling of his fate to come - one sentence of the message instructs his family on what to do with any money in his bank account should he die			0
@entity4 itself has freely admitted that it waterboards prisoners , though it claims that they are in general ' treated well '			2
in a new propaganda video released this week , @entity72 war photographer @entity156 was put in front of the camera to describe his captivity			2
he said : ' now unless we tried something stupid like escaping or doing something we should n't , we were treated well by the @entity10			0
admission : a new @entity4 video featuring @entity72 photographer @entity156 was released this week , in which he said captives are waterboarded if they try ' something stupid ' ' some of us who tried to escape were waterboarded by our captors as @entity172 prisoners are waterboarded by their @entity19 captors			1
' our strange little community of prisoners had its share of problems but apart from the odd fight we lived together in relative harmony through uncertain times			0
' we read books , played recreational games and gave lectures on our specialist subjects			0
it was n't a bad life			0
' he then described how successive @entity189 prisoners - @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193 - were let go while the @entity72 and @entity19 governments ' stone - walled ' @entity4 attempts to acquire ransoms			1
@entity197 is the latest westerner whom @entity4 have indicated they are going to murder			0
there are also fears for @entity201 , an aid worker from @entity202			0
videos showing the murders of @entity19 journalist @entity205 , @entity72 humanitarian @entity206 and @entity207 , another @entity72 aid worker , have also been released .			1
