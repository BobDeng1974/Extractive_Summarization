@entity1 manager @entity0 has revealed the freak injury @entity3 picked up against @entity4 was merely from passing the ball with the outside of his left foot			1
@entity3 faces around two months of rehabilitation after scans on international duty with @entity11 discovered a ' partial rupture of the outer band of the left knee joint ' which he suffered during the @entity17 clash at @entity18			1
@entity0 said on the injury : ' ( @entity21 ) you know how @entity3 did the injury ? passing the ball with the outside of his left foot			1
he must have done that a million times			0
he told me he just wanted to give the ball like that ( flicked with the outside of his foot ) and heard a little crack			2
' @entity0 insists the @entity65 's knee problem is just the latest in a long line of ' coincidental injuries ' rather than down to any failing in the club 's medical support			1
he also allayed any suggestions he went against the advice of both the player and @entity1 's own medical staff by sending @entity3 out for the second half at @entity18 on october 5 , as his side looked to get back into a match they would go on to lose 2 - 0			1
@entity1 recruited @entity11 's former head fitness coach @entity77 to help the current backroom team			2
@entity0 , however , maintained there could have been no way to forsee another injury setback after forward @entity82 fractured a bone in his foot when making a last - minute tackle against @entity86 , and then @entity88 defender @entity87 caught his studs in the @entity91 pitch which resulted in a broken ankle			1
' what is different ( this season ) is we have a bit more prevention than before for the players to prepare for the competition , and i think we have made progress , ' said @entity0			2
@entity0 has been overseeing training with a reduced squad due to the injury problems the club have @entity3 - knee injury - up to three months @entity82 - ankle - three months @entity87 - ankle - two months @entity106 - achilles - three weeks @entity107 - hamstring - two weeks @entity108 - hamstring - close to return @entity110 - calf strain - close to return @entity111 - knee - close to return @entity112 - knee - close to return @entity113 - back - close to return ' ( @entity116 ) for us this season , we had big injuries and coincidental injuries			1
' for example @entity82 - i do n't know what we can do about @entity82 's injury ? @entity87 was on his own when he did the ankle , then you have @entity3			1
' there are a lot of @entity129 injuries and not many soft tissue injuries			1
' @entity3 is not expected to feature again for @entity1 until the start of 2015			0
@entity0 , though , stressed there should be no concerns over how the player was managed at @entity18			0
' he ( @entity3 ) did not tell me anything during the game , i did not even know , ' said @entity0 , whose side tackle @entity27 on saturday looking to close back ground on the top four			1
' what happened was that at half - time , just before we went out , the physio told me ' @entity3 has a little pain with his knee , but it is not bad '			2
' he wanted to go on and i told him ' if you do n't feel well , tell me and i will take you off straight away '			0
he never did that during the whole game , and after that i left him on because we were in a position where we needed to score a goal and he can deliver the final ball			0
' then after the game , he went to @entity11			0
with @entity11 , they thought at the start it was nothing			0
' we played on sunday , on monday he was off , and on tuesday they gave him the day off			0
he was supposed to practise on wednesday			0
@entity3 took a lot of criticism for an abject performance on the left wing as @entity1 lost 2 - 0 at @entity4 ' on wednesday morning , he said he could still not practise			1
' they sent him for a scan , and in this scan they discovered that he had a knee ligament injury which is quite serious			2
' defender @entity106 is not available because of an inflamed achilles			0
winger @entity112 is set to play for the club 's under - 21s on friday after nine months out with a knee injury , while captain @entity110 could feature against @entity27 after a calf problem			1
midfielder @entity107 is expected to be back for next week 's @entity173 tie away to @entity35 in @entity174			0
@entity0 is likely to deploy @entity175 full back @entity113 at centre half against @entity27 , as @entity177 serves a suspension for collecting five yellow cards			0
@entity180 out for up to 12 weeks with knee injury			2

@entity3 could be out until the @entity183 with a knee injury
@entity0 says the @entity65 suffered the injury when passing the ball with the outside of his left foot in the 2 - 0 defeat at @entity4
@entity3 discovered the problem after joining up with the @entity11 squad
@entity0 insists @entity3 's knee problem is just another example of a long list of coincidental injuries at the club
the *64* - year - old says there have been a lot of @entity129 injuries
