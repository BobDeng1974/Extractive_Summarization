by @entity0 so now i 'm over in @entity2 , the @entity3 , and as @entity4 would say : ' i 'm a legal alien , i 'm an @entity5 in @entity2			1
' certainly an @entity5 gentleman is viewed as a bit of breed apart over here - but it 's very much in a good way			2
being well spoken and using received pronunciation still gets you a long way in @entity2			2
' oh i love your accent , ' numerous attractive females have remarked since i 've arrived			0
right at home : @entity0 is enjoying his time in the @entity3 i thought all that stuff was just in films but clearly @entity2 women really do respond to cut - glass vowels and think that means you are well - educated and cultured , a gentleman who can be trusted and well - heeled and a good catch			1
far be it for me to say if any of those apply to me but even if they do n't i 'm certainly not going to shatter any illusions			0
i 'm even happy to play up to the @entity33 style foppish character if that 's what 's expected of me			2
@entity0 and @entity0 have been living the high life as they film a special series of @entity0 in @entity2 @entity39 and @entity0 seem to be getting on famously in @entity2 it 's really not rocket science , any @entity43 guy with half a brain could come over here and clean up by pretending to be posh – and that got me thinking about what it actually means to be posh ? i recently filmed for the @entity50 chat show and he said i was definitely posh			1
i thought that was a bit ' kettle and pot ' because he sounds just as plummy voiced as i do			0
he grew up in @entity55 , went to a private school in @entity57 and then @entity58 - so not exactly the school of hard knocks and the university of life			0
but then again , i went to @entity63 and have quite a few friends called @entity65			0
plummy chums : @entity0 recently appeared on @entity50 's @entity67 but i do n't think posh means much in these days of social mobility – certainly you do n't need to born into it anymore , my father was born and bred in @entity73 , was originally a mechanic by trade and then worked extremely hard to make his fortune			1
clearly he gave me amazing opportunities and a great education but that just goes to show that nowadays being posh is a state of mind , not something you are born into			0
and so i 've devised a quick quiz to see if you pass the posh test ... do you describe your evening meal as : a : dinner b : tea c : supper is your room for entertaining at home called : a : the lounge b : the telly room c : the drawing room from the age of 10 , have you called your mother : a : mum b : @entity99 c : mummy do you drive : a : an suv b : a family saloon c : a landrover when trying to communicate an affirmative answer would you say : a : yes b : yeah c : @entity107 would you buy your jewellery from : a : a catalogue b : the high street c : a bespoke fine jeweller like @entity113 do you buy your after - shave a : the supermarket b : from the high street c : from high - end retailer like @entity118 clearly if you 've answered c to all of the above then you are posh			2
there 's nothing to be ashamed of , just come over to @entity2 you may find that you 're quite popular with the ladies here			1
lot of love , @entity0			0
@entity0 enjoys the view from the roof of his @entity2 apartment			1
