@entity0 of @entity1 could n't help laughing today , after realising that she had been attempting to have a conversation with a young athlete who was wearing heavy - looking mask and unable to speak			1
golfer @entity5 , 17 , from @entity6 , was one of a group of athletes to be put through their paces in front of the @entity0 as she toured the @entity11 in @entity12			1
realising that miss @entity5 was unable to reply , a clearly amused @entity0 burst into laughter before getting the explanation she was looking for from one of the lab staff instead			1
‘ i know she is very sporty and loves her hockey , ' she said			0
' it ’s wonderful to have a figurehead like her for me , especially as a girl			0
the facilities here are nothing like i have ever seen , ' she continued			0
' i never thought i would get the chance to experience something like this			2
’ miss @entity5 's participation in the workshop had been organised by @entity45 , a charity that supports young athletes and aims to help them realise their potential - whether via funding or training			1
@entity50 , 32 , who is around 16 weeks pregnant with her second child , is @entity45 's patron and in true sports - fanatic style , revealed that she was ' frustrated ' at being unable to exercise because of her condition			1
happily , organisers came to the rescue and , after being asked whether she wanted to try her hand at an exercise which tests mentality agility , she smiled broadly and said : ‘ finally , something i can do while i am pregnant ! ’ @entity0 , who was visiting the centre on behalf of @entity45 , which offers financial and practical assistance to young @entity63 athletes , pulled a face when she was told that recent participants included @entity67 driver @entity66 and triathletes the @entity69 brothers			1
‘ hmmmm , ’ she said , ‘ no pressure then ! ’ @entity71 to meet you : @entity0 was all smiles as she toured the workshop which was being held by sports charity , sportsaid back on her feet : @entity0 of @entity1 showed barely a hint of a baby bump as she arrived to meet athletes in @entity12 stylish : the sports - loving @entity30 opted for a chic plum dress by @entity63 label goat for the engagement @entity50 was put through four tests of increasing difficulty by neuroscientist @entity87 which involved her tapping coloured circles on a large screen			1
on one she was instructed to only press the green buttons and not red , on another to ignore verbal instructions to press one colour while tapping another			0
the sporty @entity0 , a keen hockey and tennis player , has often admitted that she and her husband , prince @entity94 , are fiercely competitive			1
and today she said wryly : ‘ you should have my husband here			2
’ wearing a plum £ 450 dress by @entity63 label goat and kneehigh elasticated black boots , @entity50 squared up to the screen and , with both her arms outstretched and ready , she appeared to complete the task with ease			1
afterwards , mr @entity105 , 34 , who was at pains to point out that he was n't being rude , said that the @entity30 had done well for ' a woman of her age '			0
'' she actually did very well for a woman of her age , ' he explained			0
' i 'm not being rude , i must stress , but your reflexes do decrease every decade you age			0
' until now sports science has concentrated on what we call a headless approach			2
concentrate on the body and leave the mind to somewhere else			0
we are trying to change that here			0
' @entity66 was here recently – he ’s 34 – and completed the tests without a single mistake			0
' when this was explained to the @entity0 , she seemed fascinated and said : ' it makes you wonder whether he is a good driver because he is so sharp mentally or whether the years of driving have honed it			1
' it ’s remarkable that people have n't really thought before of working the mind and body as one			2
this could be used in so many environments , even in an office			0
' having a go : @entity0 , whose baby bump was nowhere to be seen , stopped to try her hand at one of the tests having fun : although now limited by her pregnancy , the @entity0 is a keen sportswoman and adores sailing and rowing good reflexes : unsurprisingly , the @entity30 proved equal to the task and racked up an impressive score on the mental agility test after being greeted as she arrived by @entity150 , chief executive of sports aid , and @entity153 , @entity154 , the @entity0 was introduced to some of the young athletes who were benefitting from a day ’s workshop at the world class facilities			1
the teenagers , who have shown promise in sports as varied from swimming to the triathlon , golf and bobsleigh , have been described as some of the country ’s ‘ brightest hopes for the future ’			1
@entity50 looked fascinated as she watched @entity169 , 19 , a wheelchair athlete , who was being put through his tests that focused on his core body temperature and heart rate compared to how hard he thought he was working			1
multiple gold medal @entity63 @entity174 wheelchair athlete @entity173 explained to the @entity0 what was happened			1
afterwards , he said it was ‘ fantastic ’ that she was showing her support and said the financial help he had received from @entity45 had helped him enormously in the early stages of his career			2
mr @entity169 was also left impressed by the royal visitor , saying afterwards that she had been ' very interested ' in his progress			1
‘ she was somewhat apologetic watching me as i was working and seemed very interested in how the tests work , ' he added			0
' i felt very inspired by her visit			2
' next on her tour was the @entity189 , where several athletes , including 16 - year - old golfer @entity191 , were training in 32 degree heat with 60 per cent humidity to recreate the conditions expected during the @entity195 in 2016			1
meeting of minds : @entity0 of @entity1 meets wheelchair athlete @entity169 during her visit to the @entity12 lab pro : during the workshop , the @entity30 stopped to chat with @entity173 , who has won the @entity200 an astonishing six times hard work : after his meeting with the @entity30 , mr @entity169 was put through his paces by @entity11 technicians the pregnant @entity0 visibly flinched at the oppressive heat			1
‘ wow ! ’ she said			0
she expressed her surprise at how well the young sportsmen and women were doing in the conditions			0
‘ you seem super calm and relaxed , how on earth are you doing it ? ’ she asked			0
‘ it ’s lovely to see experience the science behind everything			0
but i am sorry that we are all watching you have to go through this			0
’ dr @entity220 , research and development director at the lab , who showed @entity50 round , said she seemed genuinely surprised at the sophistication of the equipment available to participants			2
‘ as we walked in she told me that she expected to see a small gym somewhere			0
she really did n't expect to see what we have here , ’ he said			0
‘ she was particularly fascinated at the way we can apply what we discover about the athletes to help them improve			2
’ sports aid ’s chief executive @entity150 agreed , adding : ‘ she mentioned several times about how frustrated she was at not being able to get involved because of her pregnancy and made clear she would like to come back in the future			1
‘ the one thing that has emerged from her patronage is how much she wants to champion the athletes and their parents and she was fascinated to learn what just a small intervention like today early in their careers can mean for their aspirations and achievements			0
’ glowing : @entity0 , who was pretty in a plum dress by @entity63 label goat , showed off the barest hint of a baby bump all together : @entity0 poses with a group of athletes determined to make it to @entity255 2020 during her visit to the @entity257 established in 1976 , @entity45 has helped many of the @entity63 ’s best - known sportsmen and women , including two - thirds of the @entity63 team at the @entity262 and @entity174 and more than 450 @entity63 athletes who competed at @entity264			1
support can include grants used for meeting essential costs such as travel , training , accommodation , competition fees and equipment but also workshop events such as today 's			0
@entity0 of @entity1 has been @entity274 since 2013 , reflecting her own passion for sport , in particular hockey , tennis , rowing and sailing			1
the @entity11 carries out research on elite performers – athletes , sports teams , extreme explorers – to better understand how the body and brain function			2
@entity50 's visit to @entity12 comes in the middle of a busy run of engagements , who , with her husband , prince @entity94 , will attend the @entity292 for the first time tomorrow night			1
on sunday , she joined the @entity294 and the @entity1 at the @entity295 for the remembrance sunday service and has turned out at a number of events since overcoming severe morning sickness , most notably , at the state welcome for @entity302 president @entity301 late last month			2
