by @entity0 he was the @entity2 photographer turned @entity4 painter whose oeuvre includes his take on most of the 20th century 's key moments			1
but , say the curators behind the retrospective at the @entity11 in @entity12 , there was more to @entity13 than spectacular photography			1
instead , his lengthy career encompassed several periods of artistic development , the foundation of the world 's first photo agency and some of the first photojournalism ever produced			2
revolution : this photo , taken during the may 1968 demonstrations , shows graffiti that reads : pleasure without limits portrait of a loved one : this glamorous 1967 snap shows the legs of @entity13 's wife , @entity31 encompassing surrealism , the tumultuous events of may 1968 , the @entity33 , both @entity34 and the post-war boom , @entity13 's work is also a snapshot of the 20th century - warts , wars and all			1
for @entity13 , born in 1908 , his early years were idyllic ones			2
the eldest of five brothers born to wealthy parents in @entity12 , his first attempts at photography were encouraged and abetted by his family who bought him a @entity50 camera			2
he was also taught painting by his uncle @entity52 , although , sadly , the painting lessons were cut short when @entity52 was killed fighting for @entity2 during @entity54 the post-war world saw @entity13 continue to pursue his artistic ambitions , entering a private art school and the @entity58 , the @entity12 studio of the @entity60 painter and sculptor @entity61			1
later life : @entity13 's later work focused on portraiture such as this one of author @entity65 @entity66 : @entity67 pictured at the @entity68 in @entity69 ( left ) and right , a man asleep in a @entity72 cafe in 1947 the dying days of a regime : this photo , taken in @entity75 in 1949 , shows a queue to exchange worthless paper money for gold innocent pastimes : an early photo showing holidaymakers sunbathing by the @entity82 in 1936 @entity83 : men relax next to a scrap lot on the streets of @entity87 in a photo taken in 1947 under @entity61 's tutelage , @entity13 enjoyed a classical @entity2 art education but fed up with @entity61 's rules , left for a stint at @entity93 in 1928 where he learned to speak @entity95 , before in 1930 , leaving the @entity96 to complete his military service at @entity98			1
during his military service , he met @entity99 , the wife of hedonistic @entity101 publisher , @entity102			0
drawn into their decadent social circle , he swiftly began an intense affair with @entity99 and was heartbroken when the relationship ended two years later			0
desperate to get away , he booked a one - way trip to the then @entity2 colony , @entity110 , where he survived by shooting game and selling it to locals			2
although the period saw @entity13 narrowly escape death after contracting blackwater fever , it also marked the beginning of his photographic career - all thanks to his faithful @entity50			0
glamorous : @entity13 also worked with magazines such as @entity122 , taking this glamorous shot of model @entity124 in @entity126 in 1958 portrait of an artist : @entity130 @entity129 photographed at his home in the @entity132 circa 1943 - 1944 excited : the coronation of @entity134 in 1937 drew enormous crowds , many of whom had slept on the street ( left )			1
others celebrated with the equally excited policemen important : this striking shot was taken during the @entity33 and shows the aftermath of some of the fighting striking a pose : @entity129 gets to work on a portrait of one of his favourite models , @entity147 , from his studio in @entity150 portrait of a photographer : @entity13 pictured at work in 1935 on his return to @entity2 in late 1931 , the budding photographer purchased himself a more advanced @entity157 camera and set about building a name for himself			1
his spontaneous style , capturing moments as they happened and the ordinary people who starred in them , swiftly brought him critical acclaim , although as a surrealist photographer rather than a photojournalist			0
that came later , when in 1937 when he covered the coronation of @entity134 and the adoring crowds that greeted the new monarch on the streets of @entity172			0
his reputation for capturing pivotal moments through the eyes of ordinary people was bolstered during @entity177 , thanks to his work with the @entity181 's film and photography unit , although he was later captured by the @entity183 during the @entity184			0
later , after escaping , he joined the @entity185 , documenting the activities of agents through photography and film			0
after the war , he joined @entity191 and three others to found @entity193 , the world 's first photographic agency , and travelled the world on behalf of clients ranging from @entity198 to @entity200 magazines			1
highlights included his coverage of the final days of the @entity204 administration in @entity205 before the country fell to @entity208 's communists , and the funeral of @entity210			1
his later work , much of which was devoted to portraiture and landscape , also included a rare glimpse inside what was then the @entity217 , as well as portraits of such luminaries as @entity220 and @entity221			0
although @entity13 retired in the 1970s , he continued to work but in paint instead of on film			0
he died in 2004 , aged 95 , in the small and pretty @entity225 village of @entity226 - a quiet end to a life lived vividly			2
@entity13 runs until the 9th june			1
