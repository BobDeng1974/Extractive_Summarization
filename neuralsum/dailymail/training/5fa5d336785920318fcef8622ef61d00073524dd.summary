by @entity0 published : 04:35 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 07:02 est , 19 march 2013 a power cut has left three fuel storage pools at @entity4 's tsunami - damaged nuclear plant without fresh cooling water for nearly 24 hours , raising concerns about the fragility of the tsunami - ravaged nuclear plant			1
the @entity12 nuclear plant 's operator said the temperatures in the pools was within safe limits and would remain so for four days , but the incident has highlighted the problems caused by the continued use of makeshift equipment at the damaged plant			1
a spokesman for @entity22 ( @entity22 ) said the reactors were not affected by the power outage and said staff were preparing a back - up system in case the repairs did not fix the problem			1
new aerial photo of the @entity12 plant shows the reactor buildings that were damaged by the 2011 tsunami @entity34 said : ' if the worst comes to the worst , we have a backup water injection system			1
' the command centre at the plant suffered a brief power failure just before 7pm local time ( 10am gmt ) yesterday , knocking out the cooling facilities for four fuel ponds			2
electricity was quickly restored to the command centre , and by tuesday afternoon ( this morning , @entity46 time ) the cooling system had been restored at one of the pools , but three - the pools in reactors 1 , 3 and 4 , were still broken at 6pm in @entity4 ( 9am gmt )			2
having investigated the cause of the power cut , the company concluded that it might be due to problems with each of the switchboards for the pools. , and began to prepare spare switchboards for use if it could not fix the original ones			0
@entity22 said that while the temperature in the affected pools had risen slightly , it was still well below the target control temperature			0
it said the reactors were unaffected and no other abnormalities were found			0
this image from 2011 shows a spent fuel storage pool at one of the damaged reactors in the power plant the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami destroyed the plant 's power and cooling systems , causing three reactor cores to melt and fuel storage pools to overheat			1
since then , the plant is now using makeshift systems			2
this latest incident is a major test for @entity22 to see if it has learned anything from 2011 's disaster			0
@entity22 , which has been accused of a string of cover - ups , was heavily criticsed by local media today for waiting hours before disclosing details of the power cut			1
its spokeman mr @entity34 acknowledged that the plant was vulnerable , saying : ' @entity12 still runs on makeshift equipment and we are trying to switch to something more permanent and dependable , which is more desirable			1
the march 2011 tsunami crippled the @entity12 plant when waves destroyed cooling facilities and reactors overheated ' considering the equipment situation , we may be pushing a little too hard			1
' mr @entity34 said the utility did not immediately try to switch to a back - up cooling system because doing so without finding and fixing the cause could lead to a repeat of the problem			0
there is a backup cooling system but no backup outside power , he said			0
regulators have previously raised concerns about the makeshift equipment , and have urged the plant to switch them to a more permanent arrangement			1
the operator still has to remove melted , fatally radioactive fuel from the reactors before fully decommissioning the plant , which officials say could take 40 years			0
the tsunami on 11 march 2011 saw huge waves knock out the cooling facilities at the nuclear power plant			2
as a result the reactors overheated and went into meltdown			0
the plant has since been stabilised but the full effect of the disaster is yet to be ascertained			0
@entity130 , the chief government spokesman , sought to allay concerns today , saying : ' in a sense , we have put in place measures that leave no room for worry			0

temperatures are rising at three fuel storage ponds at @entity12
plant bosses say they would be safe for four days : three days left to fix it
the plant in *northeastern* @entity4 went into meltdown after 2011 tsunami
