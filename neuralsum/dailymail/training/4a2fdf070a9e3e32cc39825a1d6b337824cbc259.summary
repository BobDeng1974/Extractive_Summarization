@entity1 's president has promised to introduce a bill as early as next week that would offer greater autonomy to rebellious regions in the @entity7 east , where separatists have been battling government troops for almost five months			1
but president @entity10 said the regions would remain part of @entity1 and rejected the idea of federalisation , something both @entity15 and the @entity15 - backed separatists are still pushing for even after a ceasefire that began on friday			1
the ceasefire agreement , reached in @entity19 , ' envisages the restoration and preservation of @entity1 sovereignty over the entire territory of @entity24 , including the part that is temporarily under control of the rebels ' , mr @entity10 said during a televised cabinet meeting			1
' @entity1 has made no concessions with regards to its territorial integrity			1
in late august , @entity44 estimated that more than 1,000 @entity15 troops were operating on @entity1 soil , helping to turn the tide of the war in the rebels ' favour			1
mr @entity10 has struggled to paint the @entity51 ceasefire agreement - reached as the rebels waged a major counter-offensive that pushed back the @entity1 troops who had encircled them - as a victory rather than a defeat			1
mr @entity10 says since the agreement , 70 per cent of the @entity15 troops in @entity1 had been withdrawn			1
he also said 700 @entity1 prisoners had been freed from rebel captivity and expressed hope that another 500 would be freed by the end of the week			2
it was unclear , however , how many of those freed were soldiers rather than civilians			0
colonel @entity69 , spokesman for the @entity70 and @entity71 , told journalists on wednesday that only 20 servicemen had returned home so far			0
in @entity76 , a rebel spokesman said a planned exchange of 36 soldiers from each side had been put off until thursday , blaming the government for the delay			0
in late august , @entity44 estimated that more than 1,000 @entity15 troops were operating on @entity1 soil , helping to turn the tide of the war in the rebels ' ( pictured ) favour the president admitted that ' implementing the ceasefire is very difficult ' and accused separatists of ' provoking ' the @entity1 troops			1
the ceasefire has been violated numerous times			0
@entity1 says five servicemen have been killed and 33 injured since friday			0
a volley of rocket fire could be heard in @entity76 late on tuesday , although the city council did not report any casualties overnight			0
mr @entity10 was vague on the specifics of his bill			0
but a previous peace plan laid out in june envisaged protection for the @entity15 language , joint patrols of federal and local police and letting local representatives give their approval for governors , who are appointed by the central government in @entity107			0
members of the @entity1 national guard patrol a checkpoint near the town of @entity112 , in @entity113 all of those concessions are minor in comparison to what the separatists want			2
at various times , they have demanded full independence from @entity107 or union with @entity15 , something that @entity15 president @entity123 has ignored			2
but even their concessions to having @entity1 become federalised would require local control over security forces and elections for governors			2
mr @entity10 may have difficulty crafting a bill that is palatable to both the separatists and his parliament , which is gearing up for a parliamentary election on october 26			0
the @entity1 public has been largely supportive of the war in the east against the separatists .			2

@entity10 said the regions would remain part of @entity1
@entity143 would offer greater autonomy to regions in the @entity147 east
but he rejected the idea of federalisation , something @entity15 is pushing for
the president added : ' @entity1 has made no concessions with regards to its territorial integrity '
