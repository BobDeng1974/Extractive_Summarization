one in five @entity1 users now combine their photos into a single image before uploading it to the app. to capitalise on this , the @entity7 firm has launched its latest standalone app called layout that lets people create such collages with up to nine images and 11 combinations			1
photos can be selected from the phone 's camera roll , or taken with the @entity19 tool , and layouts can then be ' remixed ' and edited with mirror effects and flips			1
@entity1 has launched a photo collage app called layout			2
users begin by selecting as many images , up to the maximum of nine , to feature in the collage ( pictured left )			0
as they add more images the layout of the collage changes and photos can be dragged between sections and different sized boxes as desired ( right ) it is branded in the same way as @entity1 's other standalone timelapse app , @entity37			1
the layout app has four main features called @entity40 , mirroring , @entity19 and @entity41			1

the faces tab scans all the photos in a user 's camera roll and only shows those containing people			2
once the layout is complete it can be shared to @entity1 or @entity77 , or saved to their camera roll to be shared elsewhere			1
these photos can then be zoomed , flipped to form a mirror image , or turned upside down			0
@entity1 said that of the collages already uploaded to the app , 90 per cent of these contain faces			2
the app has therefore added a @entity40 tab that scans all the photos in the user 's camera roll to show those in which it detects a face			1
