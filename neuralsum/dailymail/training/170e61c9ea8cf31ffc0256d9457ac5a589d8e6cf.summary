by @entity0 published : 19:17 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 19:17 est , 21 june 2013 family : prime minister @entity3 with his youngest child @entity5 @entity3 has indicated he is ‘ perfectly happy ’ for him and his family to eat genetically modified foods that have been deemed safe by watchdogs			1
sources close to the prime minister said he took the same view as environment secretary @entity11 , who said this week that he had eaten @entity13 foods and would happily feed his children a genetically modified tomato			1
as the government launched a push to end an effective ban on @entity13 products in @entity22 supermarkets , @entity16 repeatedly declined to say whether mr @entity3 would eat them or give them to his family			1
but yesterday a source close to the prime minister told the @entity26 : ‘ of course he would happily eat @entity13 products that have been through proper procedures			1
‘ anyone who has ever eaten a meal in the @entity32 has almost certainly eaten @entity13 , since almost all the soya produced there has been genetically modified for many years			2
‘ the point is we ca n’t carry on damning an entire technology as “ frankenstein foods ”			0
surely the sensible thing is to judge each product on its merits or demerits			0
’ mr @entity11 prompted a row with critics of @entity13 foods this week when he insisted that they are safer than those produced using conventional farming methods			2
he blamed @entity48 resistance to the technology for depriving the @entity50 of products such as ‘ golden rice ’ , which is engineered to contain high levels of vitamin a to help prevent blindness			0
grub 's up : @entity3 , pictured eating a pie at @entity58 , seems not to be worried about @entity13 produce controversy : environment secretary @entity11 viewing a genetically modified crop trial in @entity62 ministers claim @entity22 farmers and scientists are being forced to work with ‘ one hand tied behind their backs ’ because of an effective moratorium on @entity13 products , which has been in place since they became the focus of controversy in the 1990s			1
mr @entity11 insisted there was ‘ no scientific evidence associating @entity76 [ genetically modified organisms ] with higher risks ’ for the environment or human health			0
he said studies showed that the use of ‘ more precise technology and the greater regulatory scrutiny probably makes @entity76 even safer than conventional plants and food ’			0
@entity87 @entity22 ’s chief scientist , dr @entity86 , said it was ‘ hard to take lessons on science ’ from mr @entity11 and added that biotechnology not using genetic modification was already making a ‘ real difference ’ .			0
