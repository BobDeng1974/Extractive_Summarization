an @entity0 scoring a hat - trick in the @entity2 is a rare phenomenon			1

@entity10 's @entity9 celebrates completing his hat - trick on wednesday night @entity9 joined @entity12 , @entity13 ( with two ) , @entity14 , @entity6 ( twice ) and @entity4 in the @entity16 hat - trick club			1
@entity12 scored the fastest - ever hat - trick in the @entity2 , netting his three goals in a spell of only nine minutes for @entity20 against @entity21 in 1995			1

@entity23 sttiker @entity4 scored a hat - trick against @entity5 in 2004 @entity6 scored three times in one game for @entity23 and @entity33 in @entity2 @entity12 scored the fastest - ever hat - trick in just nine minutes for @entity20 against @entity21 in 1995 bizarre sights at the @entity36 with @entity38 keeper @entity37 acting as chief fire officer , extinguishing the flurry of flares thrown onto the pitch by his own fans			1
it took @entity45 and @entity37 to calm down the @entity38 fans , who had been angered when one of their number was ejected by police			0
@entity38 goalkeeper @entity37 carries a flare off the pitch at the @entity36 it took a while before a steward arrived with a sand bucket to finish the operation			2
beware the latest fashion in holding midfielders — they ’re not always the answer			0
it ’s only a few years since @entity61 was being touted as the answer to @entity64 ’s problems in that area			0
@entity66 was fortunate only to receive a yellow card for wild challenge on @entity69 that ’s the same @entity61 who was brushed aside by @entity9 for the second goal , who was lucky to stay on for his tackle on @entity69 and who was at the heart of the shambolic defensive performance			0
the official attendance was 59,803 , @entity10 past masters in the ‘ tickets sold ’ method of calculating home crowds			2
but there were plenty of empty seats for @entity10 ’s opening home @entity2 fixture , even if not quite as many as at @entity88 ’s @entity87 on tuesday night			1
@entity89 was in the crowd for @entity10 's @entity2 tie on wednesday as @entity93 boss @entity64 said in the build - up to the game , the group stages of the @entity2 are n’t quite the sell they once were			2
@entity38 players must have been grateful for the fact that @entity99 was confined to the tv studio and not managing following their awful defending			0
quite what @entity99 would have made of their first half performance can only be imagined			0
the former @entity38 manager of course was famous for marching onto the pitch after a cup win at @entity107 rivals @entity5 and planting a flag in the centre circle .			0

@entity9 becomes only third @entity0 to score a @entity2 hat - trick in last 10 years
@entity10 *striker* joins @entity4 and @entity6 in elite club
@entity38 keeper @entity37 extinguished flurry of flares thrown onto the pitch by his own fans
