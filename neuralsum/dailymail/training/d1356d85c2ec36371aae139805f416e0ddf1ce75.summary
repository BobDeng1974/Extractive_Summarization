record - breaking goose has delighted her farmer by laying ten times more eggs than normal and is now on course for early retirement			1
@entity7 farmer @entity6 , 69 , adores his goose called @entity9 who has popped one out every other day for the last three months			1
farmyard geese normally lay a clutch of around 15 eggs in @entity15 and then no more for the rest of the year			1
@entity17 : mr @entity6 is happy to keep his goose @entity9 as a pet when she retires delighted : farmer @entity6 , 69 , whose goose @entity9 has laid a record breaking number of eggs but mr @entity6 was shocked and delighted when he discovered @entity9 had started laying out of season in october			1
since then the mother goose has n’t stopped - laying an egg without fail every other day for the past four months			0
two - year - old @entity9 has kept mr @entity6 and his wife @entity27 busy collecting eggs through the winter - and making a mountain of cakes and omelettes			1
the farmer said : ' i have had poultry all my life and i ’ve never had a bird do this before			0
@entity9 laid 15 eggs in february but left her nest after a month			1
' then in october she began laying eggs out of nowhere - we ’ve had one every other day without fail since then			0
@entity42 : record - breaking @entity9 who has been laying ten times more eggs than other less prolific geese @entity9 is not your average goose as she is an @entity48 breed , traditionally heavier and larger than a typical goose bred for commercial output			1
' so far she ’s laid more than 70 eggs and that ’s just the ones we know about			1
' she also goes off to lay eggs by the hedge in the field but the crows get to them before we do			0

but with @entity9 laying at her current record - breaking rate she may run out of eggs within a few years			0
mr @entity6 , who farms in @entity67 , @entity7 , said : ' i am just wondering how long she will keep it up			2
' geese normally go on laying for around 16 years but @entity9 could finish her lifetime supply of eggs in the next three years - and she is only four - years - old now			2
' if that happens then we will keep her as a pet - i think she will have earned an early retirement after all that			0
' @entity78 , secretary of the @entity79 of @entity80 , said she had never heard of an @entity82 goose like @entity9 laying so many eggs			2
she said : ' that is most unusual in an @entity85			0
most geese lay from february to may			2
' other breeds will quite often lay a clutch in october but we ’ve never heard of an @entity48 laying so well and for so long			0
