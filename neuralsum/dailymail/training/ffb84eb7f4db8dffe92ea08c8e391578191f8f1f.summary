by @entity0 rising numbers of schools are abandoning a-levels in favour of alternative qualifications amid anger at constant ‘ meddling ’ with the exam system			1
demand for exams created for pupils in @entity11 , @entity12 and the @entity13 has soared nearly 50 per cent in a year , with top private schools leading the charge away from the ‘ gold standard ’ a-level			1
with teenagers across the country awaiting a-level results next week , it emerged that more than 100 @entity22 schools entered pupils for an international version of the exam amid ‘ instability ’ in the domestic system			1
reaction : @entity22 schools are entering pupils for alternative versions of the exam amid ' instability ' in the @entity22 figures also show a four per cent surge in the numbers choosing the @entity37 , a broad - based diploma qualification offered around the world			1
and a third alternative to a-levels - the @entity42 - has seen a 10 per cent spike in demand compared with last year			1
head teachers are predicting that appetite for alternative qualifications will rise again over the next two years as the @entity48 ushers in further reforms to a-levels			1
former education secretary @entity51 ordered a radical overhaul of the exam to restore rigour to the system by scrapping pass - as - you - go modules and bringing back end - of - course exams			1
but critics are concerned at ‘ political interference ’ in exams and the possibility that changes could be reversed by a future @entity65 administration			2
there is also opposition to the splitting of as - levels from the main a-level , which will put an end to the practice of awarding pupils a grade half - way through their a-level courses			1
international a-levels have been offered for more than 50 years by @entity78 ( @entity78 ) for schools overseas			2
syllabuses are designed to avoid cultural bias and take a global approach			0
they also retain as - levels at the half - way stage of the courses			2
figures from @entity78 show that pupils took 1,377 international a-levels this summer – up from 927 last year			2
whereas last year 72 schools entered pupils , more than 100 – most of them private schools - did so this year			1
some 36 are enrolling significant numbers of entratns			0
the @entity37 , meanwhile , was developed in @entity95 to offer sixth - formers around the world a broad education , with pupils taking a range of subjects as well as writing an extended essay and undertaking community work			1
controversy : former education secretary @entity51 controversially scrapped ' pass - as - you - go ' modules and brought back end - of - course exams latest figures , from the @entity37 , show that 4,790 @entity22 candidates took the qualification this year – up from 4,589 in 2013			1
some 153 @entity22 schools are offering the @entity37 this year – 82 private and 71 state			1
the @entity42 was devised by @entity78 in 2008 as a more traditional and rigorous approach to sixth - form study , with more emphasis on written exams and less coursework			2
dozens of private schools offer it in some subjects , including @entity122			1
@entity78 said entries for the pre-u had risen from 3,831 last year to 4,232			0
at the same time , the number of a-level entries this year declined three per cent , although it remains the qualification of choice for the vast majority of sixth - formers			2
@entity132 , chairman of the @entity133 ’ and @entity134 ’ @entity131 ( @entity135 ) , which represents leading private schools , said : ‘ the numbers at the moment seem to be small but these movements could be indicative			1
‘ there is considerable concern about the changes and the way in which the changes will be implemented , and schools will be looking at alternatives			0
’ there was less scope for ‘ political interference ’ and ‘ meddling ’ in qualifications such as the ia - level and @entity37 , he said			0
‘ we are all uncertain about what lies ahead			0
the mood inside independent and maintained schools generally is wait and see , but wait and see with apprehension and not wait and see with confidence			0
’ the @entity160 , in @entity159 , has already introduced the @entity161 in biology and will consider moving towards it in other subjects			0
headmaster @entity165 said that one attraction of ia - levels was that they were ‘ stable ’ at a time of ‘ great change at a-level ’			0
‘ the other great attraction of the @entity161 is that it keeps the as - level component and you have public exam results at the end of the lower - sixth , ’ he said			0
pupils worked harder and paced themselves better if they faced an exam half - way through their a-level courses , which also provided valuable information for universities , he said			2
‘ the reforms @entity51 put into action were a sledgehammer to crack a nut			2
there were some problems with a-level that needed reform but not this wholesale , rushed - in reform which could create a whole series of worse problems , ’ he warned			0
battleground : head teachers warn the different forms of exam may be used as ammunition by the @entity65 dr @entity201 , director of the @entity37 at @entity202 , the @entity203 public school , said : ‘ unlike many schools , we offer both the @entity37 diploma and a-levels and the trend we ’re seeing is strongly towards the @entity37			1
‘ the numbers have doubled since 2012 to nearly half our 210 - strong sixth form			0
we know why this is because our students tell us : it ’s about the increasing competition for the best university places			0
’ a number of top @entity22 universities are now making ‘ very attainable offers ’ to students taking the @entity37 , he said			1
‘ the @entity37 can also be a ‘ golden ticket ’ to overseas universities , ’ dr @entity201 said			0
‘ many of our pupils have their sights set on elite @entity13 universities and this year we have @entity37 students going to @entity227 , @entity228 ( @entity228 , @entity229 ) , @entity230 and @entity231			0
‘ the other reason is that the best and brightest students want to take a course which is more intellectual , more fun and more interesting with real links between the subjects			0
‘ the way we run @entity37 classes at @entity240 is at first - year university level and the @entity37 organisation has evidence that @entity37 students are less likely to drop out of university , showing what great preparation the @entity37 is for further education , as well as all - round intellectual and character development			0
