serendipity in store : the machine has an unexpected variety of old books that leaves some ' mystified ' or ' amused ' by what book they get quirky invention : the machine is ' the ultimate expression of the serendipity , ' store owner @entity23 says ‘ in our shop , we always try to startle browsers with the oddest and most unexpected variety of old books so the idea of a book randomiser was a natural extension of the store 's philosophy			2
