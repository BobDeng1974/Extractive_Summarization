by @entity0 published : 05:03 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 05:49 est , 7 january 2014 the @entity2 has been forced to use ice - cutting vessels to try and keep the shipping channels open , as the big freeze has frozen over huge lanes between @entity7 and @entity8			1
as the nation struggles to function in spite of the plunging temperatures caused by a ' polar vortex ' that has led to the coldest morning in decades , heavy ships that can break chunks of ice are working around the clock to clear major shipping routes and ensure freighters do n't get stuck in the thick ice			1
the ice cutters make clear paths through @entity22 and the @entity23 as blocks of ice forms in the @entity26 , where ice can form up to a foot thick in the waterways			1
the @entity29 , the 140 - foot tug , breaks ice in the @entity32 shipping channel ( seen here in december in @entity34 , @entity35 ) the ice cutters have been making clear paths through @entity22 and the @entity23 as blocks of ice forms in the @entity26			1
the @entity38 ( seen here in december ) is one being used to try and keep the channels open the tug @entity42 pushing the barge innovation follows the @entity29 in december			2
huge chunks of ice have formed between the @entity7 and @entity8 because of the polar vortex four of the gigantic vessels have been working around the clock to keep the shipping lanes open for freighters that connect the river paths to deliver goods between the @entity54 and the @entity55 , @entity47 reported			1
the turbulent weather conditions have been caused by a ' polar vortex ' of frigid arctic air , which is predicted to bring record - breaking cold temperatures to the @entity55 and @entity60 today			1
forecasters predict that some 187 million people have now felt the effects of the ‘ vortex ’ , with much of the country suffering a historic freeze that closed schools and businesses on monday			1
but more than 70 daily record lows are predicted to fall by the wayside today from the @entity71 to the @entity60 and @entity54 , reports @entity72			2
big chill : the polar vortex has wreaked havoc across the nation and grounded flights , blocked roads and even frozen up the shipping channels today 's morning lows will plummet into the 20s below zero over much of the @entity82 , teens below zero in much of the western @entity26 and @entity84 , and below zero as far south as the southern @entity85			1
particularly notable will be the cold in the @entity84 on tuesday morning			2
for example , @entity87 , @entity84 may have its coldest morning in almost 20 years ( jan. 18 - 19 , 1994 ) , and may be within five degrees of its all - time record of -20 set on jan. 21 , 1984			2
flights , trains and bus transportation can again expect disruptions as even parts of the country used to fending off hypothermia and frostbite are having to take extra precautions as temperatures and wind chills approach record levels			2
the frigid air that virtually shut down major cities and tiny towns in the @entity54 will spread to the @entity105			0
@entity107 temperatures broke records in @entity109 , while @entity111 residents dealt with inches of snow and numerous power outages			0
the coldest temperature in @entity109 is a frigid 16 below zero with a wind chill factor of negative 50 in some parts - and the freeze shows no sign of abating @entity109 has suffered plunging temperatures and seen much of its infrastructure suspended because of the freezing conditions ' the cold is the real killer here , ' @entity124 mayor @entity123 says in asking schools and businesses to close for a second straight day			1
the shipping lanes were n't the only form of transportation disrupted by the historic freeze			1
there also were widespread delays and cancellations in ground transportation - including @entity138 , buses and commuter trains			0
officials with @entity109 's commuter rail , @entity143 , said there were multiple accidents , including one in which 14 passengers reported injuries - and six were taken to the hospital with minor injuries - after a train hit a ' bumping post ' at a downtown station			0
weather - related engine problems forced an @entity138 train carrying 200 passengers to stop for more than 8 1/2 hours in southwestern @entity35 before arriving early monday morning in @entity109			0
and the @entity159 men 's basketball team spent the night on a church floor in central @entity161 after their bus got stuck in a snowdrift on @entity164 following sunday 's storm			0
drivers did n't fare much better			0
a state emergency official said nearly 400 vehicles - including six semis - were stuck for several hours overnight on sunday along a snowy stretch of interstate in southern @entity161			0
firefighters contend with dangerously cold temperatures and wind as they battle a structure fire in an industrial park on monday , just south of @entity177 , @entity111 @entity178 , 22 , crawls under a car driver by @entity180 , 43 , in an attempt to free it , in @entity182 , @entity35			0
@entity182 recorded more than 13 inches of snow			0

ice can form up to a foot thick in the rivers that connect the @entity26
