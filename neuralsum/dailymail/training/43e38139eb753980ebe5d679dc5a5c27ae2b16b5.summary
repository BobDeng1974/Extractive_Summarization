@entity0 has told @entity1 to forget any idea he has of leaving @entity3 this month			1
@entity1 ’s apparent agitations to leave the club threatened to plunge @entity3 into a major striker crisis so soon after @entity8 ’s departure for @entity9			1
but in talks this week @entity0 has told the @entity11 he can not leave until the summer at the earliest , suggesting also that a move to @entity13 – known admirers of the 29 - year - old – would represent a ‘ sideways or downwards ’ step in his career			1
@entity1 controls a ball during a @entity3 training session on wednesday after the sale on @entity8 , @entity3 are expected to hold on to want - away striker @entity1 ( right ) @entity0 attempted to play down the issue on thursday , but that should not disguise the strength of anger felt among senior members of the club ’s hierarchy , who @entity30 understands were furious with the comments @entity1 made in a @entity11 television interview last weekend			1
there is also expected to be a backlash from the club ’s supporters , when @entity3 face @entity37 in the @entity38 on sunday , despite @entity0 ’s suggestion that naivety was the root of the issue			1

he is a good player and i ca n’t afford to lose any more good players			0
‘ every player in the world has a possibility of moving but it does n’t mean that possibility has to come to a reality			0

then , if he had ambitions at that point , we could discuss them			0
’ @entity0 added : ‘ what i did talk to @entity58 about was how these things are perceived inside and outside the club			2
' he probably was n’t fully aware of what those comments cause and i made him aware of that when i spoke to him			0
‘ he ’s not stupid , but i do n’t think he honestly thought it would be perceived the way it was			0
it ’s not the type of culture you want here in @entity87 , but it happens a lot on the continent			0
