she tried to stop you and not one of those knife wounds killed her outright			0

' the real mitigation is his guilty plea			0
he has never denied responsibility for the killing			0
' this was an act carried out in the heat of the moment , there is no evidence it was pre-meditated and clearly he was emotionally immature			0
' he lost his temper and committed the most dreadful , dreadful act			0
