by @entity0 published : 23:50 est , 11 august 2013 updated : 06:47 est , 12 august 2013 a $ 1 million @entity2 research mission is nearing completion as six crew members prepare to come back down to @entity5 - from the slope of a @entity8 volcano			1
@entity10 ( @entity9 and @entity11 ) aims to address problems that may be encountered in future space missions by simulating exploration in areas of the world similar to space environments			0
the aim of this first mission , funded by @entity2 ’s @entity20 , the @entity21 and @entity22 , was to learn about living and cooking in @entity25			1
the volcano is a barren landscape , an abandoned quarry with little vegetation that 's as similar to @entity25 ' landscape as planet @entity5 can get			1
the crew members have been living under @entity25 - like conditions			1
according to @entity10 ' communication latencies and blackouts , in close quarters , under strict water - use rules , etc ' are part of the deal			2
the food study was designed to test food preparation strategies for long - term space exploration			2
spam on @entity25 : canned and prepackaged foodstuffs are a must for space travel food lab : crew member @entity29 gets creative in the kitchen the crew : @entity10 - @entity10 ' first team has spent four months on the side of a volcano in @entity77 ' some success meals were @entity80 borscht , @entity82 tagine , enchilasagna , seafood chowder , and fabada asturiana			1
wraps work really well : we combine tortillas , different vegetables , @entity91 cheese , and sausage or canned fish into ever - changing combinations , ' hi - seas commander @entity85 told @entity95			2
the freeze - dried vegetables were a big hit , he said , and were used in almost every meal			0
but , he added , ' the freeze - dried meat is only really enjoyable when used in meals			0
in itself it ’s too bland and hardly has any aroma			0
' there were also some meals that the crew wo n't be advocating for a real mission to @entity25			1
' our least favorite pre-prepared meal must be " @entity110 , " ' said @entity85			0
' the texture of the meal could be best described as " slimy			0
" ' mood lighting : the crew eats dinner in the dark after a blackout kitchen creatives : this dish is called ' @entity120 ' and is bound to excite the palate of any astronaut bound for @entity25 window on the world : crew member @entity29 looks out over ' @entity25 ' @entity85 's @entity25 must - haves include spices , herbs , hot sauce @entity128 , peanut butter and margarine			1
the @entity10 crew has also been experimenting with remote controlled robotic arms to grow food crops in a hydroponic ' robotic farm '			0
some crew members have been practicing terrain exploration , leaving their habitat and venturing outside , fully kitted out in their spacesuits , onto the barren lava field to conduct experiments with thermal imaging , geological identification , and microbiological detection			1
@entity2 is also comparing various fabrics and ' anti-microbial treatments ' for clothing worn in space , to test exactly how long clothing can be worn before it 's found ' objectionable ' to the wearer			0
the crew is due to exit the @entity8 habitat on monday , 13 august .			2

a six - person research mission to the @entity25 - like terrain of a @entity8 volcano ends today
the crew 's aim was to learn about living and cooking on @entity25
they lived in a geodesic dome and only ventured outside fully kitted out in spacesuits
