by @entity1 reporter published : 21:23 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 01:08 est , 21 june 2013 a @entity3 comedian has taken it upon himself to get the city 's homeless in shape - by teaching @entity7 using stationary @entity8			1
the ingenious idea was captured in a hilarious video by funnyman @entity11 aka ' @entity12 ' in which he cites wanting the homeless people of @entity3 to have the opportunity to have ' gorgeous bodies ' as the reason for the venture			1
the bike share scheme kicked off in the @entity19 recently but , at nearly $ 10 a day , the cost of biking around @entity22 is almost as punitive as the $ 32 price of a sought - after @entity24			1
however , the fact the pedals still spin when the bikes are in the dock means @entity29 has ' opened up a whole new world ' to the @entity3 's poor , he says			2
he says he rounded up the participants in @entity43 in the @entity44 and they all jumped on a bike at a nearby docking station			0
' there were five or six people who were like , " let 's party , " ' he told the @entity50			0
' i think they recognized a good time			0
' in the class , which was @entity11 's third , he yells out common spin phrases like ' this is a cardio party ' and ' you guys feelin ' the burn ? ' ' @entity12 ' said he regularly makes silly videos and the soul cycle spin off similarly started out as a joke			1
but he told the @entity50 that it has ' kind of turned into a real thing ' and he wants to keep it going as long as the demand is there			0
midriff - bearing : the comedian says all @entity3 , even himself , can get in shape joke : he said it started off as a joke but due to high demand , he 's taking the classes for real now ' this is an unintended consequence , ' he said			1
' i got dozens of emails today from people saying , " if you put up a schedule , i will come			0
" ' on thursday he tweeted : ' i 'm teaching @entity85 classes to homeless people in @entity3 using parked @entity8			2
' he says the class is n't just for the homeless - anyone who balks at the idea of paying the exorbitant cost of the real thing can join in			2
' indoor cycling is too expensive it 's not available to everybody , ' he says in the video			1
@entity97 : in the class , which was @entity11 's third , he yells out common spin phrases like ' this is a cardio party ' and ' you guys feelin ' the burn ? ' happy customer : this participant exclaims on the tape : ' my legs feel better ' adding to the @entity50 , @entity109 says : ' it 's for whoever wants to show up			2
everyone can kind of get into shape â€” me , first and foremost			0
' but his main mission is to help those living on the streets attain ' beautiful definition			0
' ' i want the homeless people of @entity3 to have the opportunity to have sick bodies			1
they could have really gorgeous bodies they just need the right work out regimen and @entity29 has really opened up a whole new world to them			1
i 'm just a @entity3 helping other @entity3 get beautiful definition			0
' and , at least one participant is on his way there			0
' my legs feel better , ' an unnamed @entity134 student says on the video			0
gorgeous bodies : even the homeless deserve gorgeous bodies @entity11 says the real thing : soul cycle is a luxxe cycling gym class in @entity3 where classes cost $ 32 a time			1

@entity11 aka ' @entity12 ' started the classes as a joke but wants to continue them after strong demand
at $ 32 a class he claims indoor cycling classes like @entity7 are too expensive for many @entity3
he wants the homeless to have the opportunity to have ' gorgeous bodies '
@entity11 has conducted at least three classes at @entity29 docks in @entity22 for anyone who wants to join in
@entity29 is a bike share scheme that *launched* in @entity3 last month
