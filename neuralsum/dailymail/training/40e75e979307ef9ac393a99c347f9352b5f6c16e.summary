but now a digital image expert has brought the @entity5 up to date by superimposing them into today images of their home town			1
@entity9 merged old photographs of @entity5 with present day scenes to create these fascinating montages spanning half a century			1
this early image of the band shows @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 with drummer @entity21 playing in the original @entity14 - which was demolished in 1982 - montaged with a modern picture of the rebuilt @entity14 - which opened two years later this eerie image of the @entity5 messing about with a fire extinguisher at @entity26 s @entity25 in 1964 , merged with the same staircase as it is now @entity20 as a schoolboy outside his home in @entity30 with his @entity31			1
the house is now owned by the @entity33 and is open to the public @entity36 's mother @entity35 polishing her door knocker in @entity38 , @entity2 his father , also called @entity9 who remembers @entity2 in the 1960s well , helped his son recreate the images			1
mr @entity9 said : ' over the last few months i ’ve done a series of ' then and now ' pictures			1
' my dad is great			2
he remembers everything in great detail - where everything was and what all the shops were called			2
' it ’s harder than it looks getting the angles right in each photo			0
' i have to take a copy of it with me and try to stand in the exact same spot for the ‘ now ’ photograph as the photographer must have been for the ‘ then ’ image			0
' then it ’s a case of trying to match the two images up in @entity63			1
it ’s nice to think of the history in each image as i ’m putting it together			0

' in 1981 plans were revealed to excavate the buried remains of the @entity14 cellar			0
it would form part of a £ 7million redevelopment project of the former warehouse site of 8 - 12 @entity79 which had housed @entity14 up until its closure in 1973			0
the original club was knocked down in 1982 but more than 15,000 bricks from the building were saved and used to rebuild the premises using the same plans			0
the @entity14 re-opened in 1984			0
today the club occupies 75 per cent of the first site but is deeper , meaning revellers now descend 30 steps compared to 18 steps in 1962			2
