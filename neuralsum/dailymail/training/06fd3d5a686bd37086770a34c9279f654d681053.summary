by @entity0 published : 08:07 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 09:31 est , 7 february 2014 @entity3 has emerged as a leading candidate to make a shock return to the helm of the @entity8 cricket team by replacing @entity9 as coach			1
@entity11 , sacked by @entity8 five years ago after @entity13 ’s attempt to oust him , has rebuilt his reputation at @entity15 as one of the best coaches in the domestic game			1
@entity19 understands he would love to have a second crack at the biggest job in @entity24 cricket and the @entity25 , who feel he was hard done by last time , will seriously consider his claims when they begin interviewing later this month			2
not each other 's cup of tea : ousted : @entity13 ( right ) attempted to have @entity3 removed as @entity8 coach during his first stint let 's sit down and talk about it : @entity11 in discussion with @entity13 in the @entity37 nets in 2007 happier times : @entity3 and @entity13 have a chuckle in the nets at @entity40 in 2008 return ? @entity3 , who was @entity8 coach between 2007 and 2009 , is in line to replace @entity9 @entity3 , whose methods did alienate some senior players other than @entity13 , is particularly adept at working with emerging talent which may add to his claims of landing a job with a ‘ new ’ @entity8 team			1
@entity48 , who has enhanced his claims on the top job by backing the decision to sack @entity52 , remains the hot favourite and would be a popular choice among players who have enjoyed working with him in one - day cricket			0
winner : peter moores with the @entity61 trophy he won with @entity15 in 2011 @entity63 , cutting his coaching teeth with @entity65 , looks sure to feature in @entity8 ’s new coaching team , either as @entity48 ' assistant if the one - day supremo lands the job or possibly as batting coach			1
but the strong support within the team and the @entity25 for @entity48 will not stop @entity8 advertising the job next week , with managing director @entity74 using head hunters in an attempt to attract the biggest names in world coaching			1
it seems increasingly likely that @entity74 will not be able to consider the outstanding candidate for the job in @entity82 , who again distanced himself from the @entity8 job on friday			2
‘ it would have been a great challenge , ’ the former @entity85 and @entity86 coach told @entity87			0
‘ it ’s a pressurised role and i think over many years @entity9 did an exceptional job			2
i had many chats with @entity9 and i enjoyed his way			0
‘ i have often wondered if i could go in there with my coaching philosophies and seeing if it could work in that environment			0
i would have enjoyed that challenge			0
but i ’m taking on an @entity99 team in @entity100 – thank goodness it ’s for a shorter spell of time – and i ’m really looking forward to it			0
’ yet , as @entity106 pointed out in these pages earlier in the week , @entity105 did not actually say no and if @entity74 decides that he really is the exceptional candidate then it would be intriguing to see what would happen if the @entity25 threw money at him			2
@entity3 the merrier : the coach , stood in front of the old @entity40 pavilion in 2009 , has restored his reputation @entity3 's test record as @entity8 coach : played 22 won 8 lost 6 drawn 8 @entity118 won : 3 ( out of 7 ) @entity105 earns £ 300,000 for just six weeks with @entity119 and works as a batting consultant for his native @entity86 for 50 days a year from his @entity122 home			1
it is a lifestyle he wanted after becoming disillusioned with the daily treadmill of life on the road and , with @entity8 now convinced they must have one job in the role across all forms , @entity74 would clearly have some serious persuading to do to land @entity105			0
as it is good performances on the one - day tour of @entity134 and the @entity135 in @entity136 could seal the job for @entity48 while a former @entity8 coach in @entity139 waits patiently in the wings			1
@entity8 also hope to fill the vacancy on their selection panel next week with @entity143 a leading candidate			1
another @entity145 man in @entity146 would be hotly fancied should @entity8 decide that , as with @entity48 , there is no conflict of interest in being attached to a county and be a selector .			0

@entity3 a leading candidate to replace @entity9
@entity3 was dismissed as @entity8 coach in 2009
@entity25 think he was hard done by five years ago
