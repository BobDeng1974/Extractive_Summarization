professor @entity0 has warned ' human stupidity ' is the biggest threat to civilisation professor @entity0 has warned ' human stupidity ' is the biggest threat to civilisation			1
the physicist , 46 , said that the possibility of ' catastrophic climate change ' , ' crop disease caused by a loss of biodiversity ' and ' asteroid impact ' could wipe out mankind			1
and he believes there has been a lack of action from world leaders on tackling the threats			1
' the biggest threat to civilisation is human stupidity , ' he said			2
' the problem with these points is that if you make them carelessly you end up sounding like @entity24 in his teenage years , ' he told @entity26 magazine			1
' they 're so obvious that they become cliched positions to take , but actually they 're not cliched positions			2
' the more we consider our position in the wider universe , the more pressing these questions become			1
' he added : ' when you think about these things , you end up with your head in your hands			2
imagine an alien from another galaxy came and had a look at us			0
' if there 's just this one planet on which there 's any meaning , how would you arrange your affairs ? would you really sit there and divide it up into lots of autonomous regions and spend a lot of money making sure they do n't invade each other ? ' or would you be more concerned with protecting civilisation as a whole , such as making sure we 're not going to get wiped out by a big space rock			1
' he warned : ' it wo n't turn out well for us if we sit here on @entity66 and do n't bother with space			1
as a world , i would like to see us go to @entity70 - for the same reason we went to the moon			1
' one of professor @entity0 ' main concerns is climate change			1
this graphic from the @entity78 's @entity77 shows projected climate change from 2081 - 2100 when do you think we will find life on other planets ? we should be on the verge			2
if there is life on @entity70 we should find it in the next decade or so			1
we ’re also at the stage now , with the new generation of telescopes , where we can look at the light coming through the atmospheres of planets out there and start to characterise it			0
we might detect life on other planets before we detect it in the solar system which is exciting			0
do you think we can create robots that are conscious ? i suspect we will do it at some point			0
i think we will make a machine that is conscious , unless there is some physics that we do n’t understand about consciousness			0
if you think the brain is basically a computing device , but a very complicated one , then presumably it operates according to the known laws of physics and therefore you should be able to simulate them			0
do you think we should be working on artificial intelligence if it 's a threat to humanity ? i mean , you are talking about the far future			0
and things you say about the far future often sound fantastical			0
but [ the threat of artificial intelligence ] is a legitimate question			0
it ’s an ethical dilemma			0
conscious things are notoriously difficult to deal with – look at humans			0
. many people would argue ignorance is more dangerous than knowledge , but of course you have to learn to be responsible with knowledge			2
what research are you most excited about at the moment ? i ’m very excited about the discovery of the @entity135 particle			0
there are huge problems with the way that fits into our picture of the universe			2
so the fact the @entity143 is coming back online again next year , and that we ’re going to start exploring the @entity135 particle for the first time , is interesting			2
professor @entity0 points out that the @entity149 astronauts thought we 'd be on @entity70 by now , and that we 'd have moon bases by the 1980s			1
in an interview with @entity152 earlier this month , professor @entity0 said the problem is in human behaviour			1
' we just do n’t accumulate knowledge at the rate that we could			1
' we just do n’t			0
i mean , you can see it by the figures			0
we spend virtually about as much on it as everyone else , which is sod all			0
' professor @entity0 has filmed a new five - part series , @entity165 , for @entity166			1
he spent three hours in a spacesuit for the show and admitted : ' you 'd think it would be brilliant being an astronaut but i knackered my ribs and they took five months to recover			2
' he said of his career on the small - screen : ' @entity176 's really important but i do n't see myself as a tv presenter			1
' i want to carry on encouraging governments to do the correct thing , which is to invest in education and research			0
' the physicist , 46 , said that the possibility of ' catastrophic climate change ' , ' crop disease caused by a loss of biodiversity ' ( right ) and ' asteroid impact ' ( left ) could wipe out mankind			1

46 - year - old says *politicians* are not doing enough to tackle the threats
warning is more urgent given how unique we are in universe , he says
professor @entity0 points out that the @entity149 astronauts thought mankind would be on @entity70 by now , and that we 'd have moon bases by the 1980s
he says that we just do n't accumulate knowledge at the rate we should
