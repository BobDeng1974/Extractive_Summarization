a storied piece of @entity2 history is being kept away from the public as the federal government tries to cut costs during the sequester			0
the retired @entity8 airplane that is now holed up in a private hanger in @entity10 is the same one where @entity11 stood as @entity13 was sworn in , as her husband 's blood was still fresh on her jacket			1
it is the same airplane that ferried then - president @entity18 to @entity19 in his famed trip done to help smoothe tensions with the @entity23 power			1
historic moment : @entity13 was sworn into his presidency on board the now - retired @entity8 , with president @entity11 's wife @entity26 standing alongside him on november 22 , 1963 foreign relations : it was also the plane that president @entity18 took on his landmark visit to @entity19 in 1972 on hold : the former @entity8 , now known as @entity31 ( pictured ) is normally on display to the public at the @entity34 in @entity10 but it has been closed because of the sequester and though then - vice president @entity37 was the last one to take a significant trip on it when he marked the airplane 's retirement in 1998 , it had been still pleasing visitors for years as a display at the @entity34 for years			1
that is until it was closed off to visitors , as @entity46 reports that the shuttle buses used to drive tourists to the remote hanger were seen as an excessive cost for the federally - funded enterprise			2
as a result , aviation aficionados will have to settle for the plethora of photos from the plane 's - which is now referred to as @entity31 , or @entity31 for short - it 's most dramatic - and infamous - moments			1
the first came with the death of a president , as @entity31 was the plane that ferried then - president @entity11 to @entity62 , @entity63 along with his wife on that fateful november day in 1963			1
unexpected moment : federal judge @entity67 ( left corner ) was called on board , making her the first female justice to swear in an @entity2 president following president @entity11 's assassination precious cargo : @entity11 escorts her husband 's casket off the plane when they landed at @entity78 , and his brother @entity79 is seen at her side widow 's walk : the president 's blood could still be seen on her legs and suit when they landed as a result of the assassination , it also became the plane that ferried his body back to @entity92			2
before that happened , though , it earned another distinction as it became the spot where the only female judge has sworn in a president			0
federal judge @entity67 was called on board to give @entity13 the oath of office before heading back to the @entity102 with a heartbroken first lady and presidential corpse on board			2
on hold : the former @entity8 , now known as @entity31 ( pictured ) is normally on display to the public at the @entity34 in @entity10 but it has been closed because of the sequester the plane did n't finish it 's funereal tasks there , as it later was used to fly the coffins of @entity13 and @entity18 to their final resting places , @entity63 and @entity116 respectively			1
@entity18 's most memorable moment with the plane came during his lifetime , however , as he made his 1972 trip to the @entity19			1
it was the first time that an @entity2 president visited the country , and was seen as a significant step in building diplomatic relations			0
plane diplomacy : @entity128 's trip to @entity19 ( seen here leaving alongside his wife , then - @entity129 ) in 1972 was the first time an @entity2 president visited the @entity23 country touring the @entity132 : the visit came as a surprise by many , but had positive effects on the countries ' relationship on a different trip , the plane played a role - albeit a very minor one - in one of the most embarassing moments in @entity2 politics			1
booby prize : after @entity147 was transferred from the @entity148 because she was ' too close ' to president @entity149 , she worked at the @entity150 and went on a government trip to @entity152 after becoming an intern and mistress of then - president @entity149 , @entity147 was transferred out of the @entity148 and into the staff roster for the @entity150			0
while she was upset that she was further away from her married lover , one perk that helped soften the blow was the fact that she was included on a @entity150 trip to @entity152			0
as such , she rode the plane overseas , since it was used for the trip since it was getting older and relegated to second - tier activities ( as opposed to being on call for the president 's use )			2
the plane 's final flight came just two years later when then - vice president @entity37 was on board for the last leg of a multi-decade tour of duty when it went from @entity92 to @entity174 , @entity175			0
' if history itself had wings , it probably would be this very aircraft , ' @entity37 said during the trip			0
now it is a part of history being hidden away , however , as it is off limits to visitors who make the trek to @entity187 , @entity10 to visit the aviation history museum			0
because the sequestration is still in flux , there is no telling exactly when it will be reopened to the public .			0

the retired @entity8 , now called @entity31 , is normally on display at the @entity34 in @entity10
sequestration cuts have caused the display to be closed
is the plane that took @entity201 to @entity62 , where @entity13 was then sworn - in
also carried @entity18 on his famous trip to @entity19
