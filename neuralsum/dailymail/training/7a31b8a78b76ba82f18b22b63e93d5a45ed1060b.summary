down the years and across the universe , the heroes of science - fiction classics from @entity2 to @entity3 and @entity4 have fought intergalactic battles with weapons that wipe out enemy electronics at the touch of a button			0
now scientists have turned fantasy into reality by developing a missile that targets buildings with microwaves that disable computers but do n’t harm people			1
aircraft manufacturer @entity19 successfully tested the weapon on a one - hour flight during which it knocked out the computers of an entire military compound in the @entity25 desert			1
but experts have warned that , in the wrong hands , the technology could be used to bring @entity38 cities such as @entity39 to their knees			1
during @entity19 ’s experiment , the missile flew low over the @entity42 , discharging electromagnetic pulses on to seven targets , permanently shutting down their electronics			1
@entity19 said that the test was so successful even the camera recording it was disabled			1
codenamed the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) , it is the first time a missile with electromagnetic pulse capability has been tested			2
for security reasons , @entity19 declined to release film of the test , but instead issued an artist ’s impression of it on video			1
in the clip , a stealth aircraft deploys a missile that emits radio waves from its undercarriage which knock out the computer systems inside the buildings below			1
@entity66 mission : the missile is launched from a stealth bomber and is thought to be able to penetrate the bunkers and caves believe to be hiding @entity33 's suspected nuclear facilities the company did release real film showing a row of computers that can be seen shutting down when the electromagnetic pulse is switched on			1
although the project is shrouded in secrecy , experts believe the missile is equipped with an electromagnetic pulse cannon			1
this uses a super-powerful microwave oven to generate a concentrated beam of energy which causes voltage surges in electronic equipment , rendering them useless before surge protectors have the chance to react			0
@entity89 , @entity48 programme manager for @entity19 ’s prototype arm @entity91 , said the technology marked ‘ a new era in modern warfare ’			1
he added : ‘ in the near future , this technology may be used to render an enemy ’s electronic and data systems useless even before the first troops or aircraft arrive			2
‘ we hit every target we wanted and made science fiction into science fact			0
when the computers went out , it actually took out the cameras as well			2
’ the project has cost £ 24 million and has been developed on behalf of the @entity108 following a request from the @entity110 four years ago			0
lead test engineer @entity111 said : ‘ we ’re not quite at the place where the @entity114 and @entity3 movies are but this is definitely an advancement in technology able to give us an opportunity to do things we could not do before			0
’ @entity118 , vice-president of @entity119 , said there was a real need for a weapon that could knock out a target but not cause harm to people and structures			2
he said : ‘ we know this has capabilities and impact			0
we ’re trying to see if we can get it implemented sooner rather than later			0
’ however , experts fear that the project could create an arms race , with countries scrambling to build their own electromagnetic pulse weapons			2
wiped out : @entity19 's film shows computers before ( left ) and after ( right ) the attack by the drone but experts have warned that , in the wrong hands , the technology could be used to bring @entity38 cities such as @entity39 to their knees professor @entity145 , @entity146 at the @entity147 , said the western world would be much more vulnerable to such an attack because of our increased reliance on electronics			1
he added : ‘ this is a challenging area in political and military terms			0
ideally there would have been an arms - control agreement to cover this field , because once technology is actually developed , control becomes harder			0
‘ the historical record shows that important technologies developed in one country are developed elsewhere within a relatively short period – look what happened with regard to the @entity165 and nuclear weapons			0
‘ should the @entity168 be known to have developed such a technology to the production stage , it would drive others to try to act similarly			0
‘ western countries are more dependent on electronics - based it than others and would be vulnerable to extensive disruption			0

aircraft manufacturer @entity19 have created a weapon that can knock out computers
the missile is thought to be able to penetrate bunkers and caves
experts warn , in the wrong hands , could bring @entity38 cities to their knees
