as we all sat eagerly awaiting the @entity3 ’s big - hitters to make their moves on @entity5 there was a flurry of activity in the @entity8 , as is always the case			2
for all 72 clubs january is anxious time as managers wait to see whether their star names will be plucked by the big boys in the top flight - every player has their price			1
the roles will reverse next month when sides in the @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 will do battle to feed off the scraps of @entity3 squads			0
with the 25 - man squad ruling in place dozens of quality players will be available on loan and managers and chairmen know that to acquire their services on a temporary basis could be the difference between mid-table and promotion , relegation and safety			1
@entity39 ( right ) is taken under the wing of @entity41 ( left ) after @entity42 recalled him from @entity43 @entity41 ( left ) larks around with @entity39 after the 19 - year - old winger was brought back to @entity46 but as focus switches abruptly away from the transfer market and to this weekend 's fixtures , who were the major winners and losers during the january window ? it is increasingly looking like a four - horse race for the two automatic promotion places in the championship and , despite @entity39 ’s recall by @entity42 early last month , @entity43 have stolen a march on @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 during the transfer window			1
@entity62 has added experience and depth to his squad in the form of @entity68 internationals @entity67 and @entity69 while the @entity5 loan additions of wingers @entity72 and @entity74 should more than cover for the loss of @entity39			1
despite losing @entity39 for the rest of the season , @entity43 boss @entity62 has added quality to his squad @entity62 's brought in @entity79 's @entity74 ( left ) and @entity80 's @entity72 on loan league leaders @entity58 failed in their month - long chase of @entity85 ’s highly - rated winger @entity84 , with a final £ 5million bid turned down on monday , but manager @entity87 will be pleased to have not lost any of his talented young squad to @entity3 poachers and has extended the loan deal of @entity92 goalkeeper @entity91 to the end of the season			1
@entity59 boss @entity95 , @entity97 's former no 2 at @entity98 , used his strong relationship with the @entity101 boss to his club 's advantage again by bringing in @entity105 international defender @entity104 on loan			1
@entity104 makes it three @entity101 loanees at the @entity108 , with forward @entity109 and defender @entity110 having joined on season - long deals in the summer			0
@entity112 has also arrived from @entity113 and will link up with @entity114 in @entity95 's @entity115 remaining on @entity116 despite teasing @entity59 fans on @entity5 on @entity118 by suggesting he was off to @entity120 , before revealing it was all a joke			1
it was a quiet month for @entity60 but again @entity123 will be pleased to have kept his promotion - chasing squad together , while improving it with the relatively low - key additions of veteran goalkeeper @entity127 and former @entity128 forward @entity129			2
wolves , seventh in the @entity20 , deserve a special mention			0
just 18 months after inheriting a bloated and disillusioned squad in utter disarray , @entity133 has managed to move on several more of his outcasts while continuing to develop a talented young squad with the addition of @entity139			0
they will be quietly confident of reaching the play - offs			0
@entity58 manager @entity87 will be pleased to have not lost any of his talented young squad among @entity146 boss @entity95 's additions is @entity112 from @entity113 with the likes of @entity139 , @entity130 boss @entity133 will be quietly confident of making the play - offs in @entity21 , it looks like three will go in to two for the automatic promotion places with @entity152 leading the way from @entity154 and @entity155			1
@entity154 had a mixed window with @entity157 's £ 5m move to @entity159 and subsequent loaning back for the rest of the season summing it up rather nicely			2
they lost @entity139 , who had been on loan from @entity165 , to @entity130 , but @entity167 's two goals in the 5 - 0 over @entity168 last weekend suggest the @entity170 loanee , son of former @entity79 striker @entity172 , can fill the void			1
@entity174 also boosts their striking options while @entity177 returns to stadium : @entity154 to add some experience for their promotion chase			0
@entity155 , one of the stories of the season , will be delighted to have had none of their youngsters poached by bigger clubs			0
there was little activity coming in at the @entity190 in january but a squad whose oldest player ( by a long way ) is only 28 can only get better			2
@entity154 sold @entity157 to @entity159 for £ 5m but have got him back on loan until the end of the season @entity152 have made a few shrewd loan signings but will lose striker @entity199 back to @entity200 in march			2
they will be hoping his goals will have promotion all but sewn up by then			0
in @entity22 , leaders @entity204 have made a statement of intent by bringing in @entity207 on a two - and - a - half year deal from @entity209 , while @entity210 has used his @entity212 contacts to improve second - placed @entity214 's squad			0
you can expect those two to continue to set the pace but all that can change , as in the @entity20 and @entity21 too , when loans are allowed again next month			0
window open or closed , the transfer market never sleeps			2
talent scout : @entity222 ( @entity113 , on loan from @entity42 ) with so many youngsters making temporary moves from the @entity3 to the @entity8 it really is a case of ‘ take your pick ’ , but it will be interesting to follow @entity230 ’s progress over the next few months			1
the @entity68 youth winger made headlines in 2011 after a protracted transfer saga saw him move to @entity46 from @entity154 , whose academy have also produced new @entity159 signing @entity235			0
@entity101 were also said to be interested in @entity222 before that move and it looks as though the 17 - year - old will be given his chance to shine by @entity241 manager @entity240 , who has waxed lyrical about the latest addition to his squad			0
@entity68 youth winger @entity230 ( right ) is on loan at @entity113 from @entity42 - @entity240 rates him highly			1

@entity62 signed @entity74 and @entity72 on loan for @entity43
@entity248 added will in the january window despite losing @entity39
@entity58 boss @entity87 will be pleased to have not lost any stars
@entity230 is one to watch on loan at @entity113 from @entity42
