by @entity0 last updated at 4:48 pm on 14th october 2011 relief : @entity2 survives a no confidence vote by the @entity5 parliament and is congratulated by female mps controversial @entity5 prime minister @entity2 today scraped through a crucial confidence vote and lived to fight another day after a razor thin win in parliament			1
if the no confidence vote had gone through , the 75 - year - old premier would have had to resign immediately			1
mr @entity2 , needed 309 votes to secure victory - with a defeat meaning he would have to step down - but he managed to pull the political cat out of the bag with 316 mps in his favour compared to 301 against him			2
ahead of the vote the media tycoon had predicted a win and there were loud cheers from his majority ruling centre right coalition , while the opposition jeered and whistled			2
however it was the 53rd vote of confidence he has faced since coming to power in 2008 and political commentators say he can not last in office for much longer - especially as he is currently involved in four trials			1
professor @entity36 , a lecturer in @entity5 politics at the @entity38 , said : ' it is a zombie government , not clinically dead but close to being brain dead , lurching from one crisis to another , golem - like and out of control			2
' worse , actually , because @entity2 is very much alive to his own appetites and aversions			0
' professor @entity36 added : ' the chances that this government will run its full term to 2013 are decreasing by the minute			0
spring elections are more and more likely and the overall prospects are not good			0
' immediately after the vote mr @entity2 said he would ' transfer his main working office inside parliament ' to show that he meant to solve @entity5 's problems and he added : ' we have managed to beat off the attempted assassination by the opposition			1
' @entity60 mp @entity59 of the @entity61 , said : ' it 's evident they are losing pieces - every time there is a confidence vote their numbers go down			2
we have to keep trying and we are not far off			0
' vote : @entity2 won by a narrow margin			0
he would have had to resign immediately if he had lost joker : the @entity5 pm is involved in four separate court cases mr @entity2 was under intense pressure after his coalition was defeated in parliament earlier this week during a vote on the state of the country 's public accounts - as @entity5 teeters on the edge of an economic crisis			1
the sleazy politician - who is currently involved in four trials including one for having sex with an underage prostitute – had urged parliament to give him its confidence and added : '' this must be done because of the risks the country is running			1
'' the vote came ahead of a massive demonstration planned in @entity92 for saturday with 200,000 protesters expected to vent their anger on how mr @entity2 and his government are failing to deal with the economic crisis that is threatening to topple @entity5			1
organisers said the slogan for the rally would be ' @entity100 to change @entity101 ' and similar protests were planned in other cities across the country and extra police have been drafted in for added security around banks and public buildings			0
@entity5 prime minister @entity2 attends a confidence vote in the lower house of @entity112 in @entity92 under pressure : @entity5 's @entity112 has begun debating before a confidence vote that will determine the political future of the prime minister debate : if he is defeated - in what will be the 53rd confidence vote , mr @entity2 has faced since coming to power three years ago - he will be forced to resign @entity5 - the third largest economy in the @entity121 - has a debt of more than £ 1 trillion or 120 % of its gdp and despite introducing a belt tightening 53 billion @entity128 austerity package earlier this summer there are fears the country is heading the same way as neighbour @entity132			1
financial ratings agencies and commentators say the lack of strong leadership from @entity2 and the internal squabbling indicate that he is not strong enough to carry through policies and reforms to save the country 's economy			0
besides the under age sex case which resumes next month he is also on trial for corruption and abuse of office and one commentator said he was spending more time ' talking to his lawyers then governing and should be talking more to @entity150 the head of the @entity152			0
' friendships : @entity154 ( left ) and @entity155 ( right ) are just two of the girls @entity2 has been accused of having inappropriate relationships with			0

relief for the pm as he faced the biggest test of his political career as @entity5 @entity112 decided on vote of confidence
the politician is currently involved in four trials including one for having sex with an underage prostitute
