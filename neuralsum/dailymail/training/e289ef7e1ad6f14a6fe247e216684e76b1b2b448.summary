according to the @entity116 , breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in @entity119 - accounting for 31 per cent of all newly diagnosed cases			1
the disease broadly falls into two groups			2
the first is non-invasive breast cancer , which is found in the ducts of the breast and does not spread outside the breast			1
the second is invasive cancer , which can spread outside the breast			1
it is the most common and it accounted for almost 90 per cent of new breast cancer registrations in 2011			2
according to @entity135 , in 2010 , 49,564 women and 397 men in the @entity134 were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer			1

i was about to go traveling to @entity155			0
' if i am honest , i had felt the lump before then			2
i do n’t know how long before			0
i did not think anything bad of it			0
i thought it would go away			0
' @entity10 then went to @entity155 for six months and , on her return , went back to a doctor - this time with acute pain in her breast			1
he suggested she come off her contraceptive pill - and sent her away again			2
but her mother told her to ask for a referral to a breast clinic			2
three weeks later , @entity10 was finally seen by a specialist			0
by this time , she had woken up in the morning with a blood - stained t - shirt			2
' that was terrifying , ' she said			0
' i was staying at a friends when it happened and her mother is a nurse			0
' she did n't want to say anything at the time , but she has said since how worried she was for me			0
' it was n't the first time i had discharged blood , either			0
but i still did not think it was cancer			2
you just do n't think it will happen to you			0
' finally , after several painful scans including an excruciating mammogram , a cancerous lump the size of an avocado was found in her breast - almost a year after she first went to her doctors			1
' i cringe about it. , ' @entity10 said , ' i think back and cringe about not seeing or acknowledging the signs			0
' i do not want to blame myself though			0
it was lack of awareness			0
i did not think it would happen to me			0
' a medic who noticed @entity10 had pain in her back during one of her scans suggested she was tested for cancer in her spine			1
@entity10 added : ' i had been having pain in my back for a while - which i blamed on a skiing injury			2
i just knew deep down that it was cancer in my bones			2
' seven days later , her fears were confirmed			0
it was during her first round of chemo that , feeling frustrated at the lack of help and support for younger cancer sufferers , she and @entity95 set up @entity26 ! - which she says will continue to help people for many years to come			1
@entity26 ! 's next move is to start targeting schools - training teachers to educate young people about their bodies and to get in to the habit of checking themselves at a young age			1
one of the charity 's numerous fun , attention grabbing campaigns saw scores of women dressed as breasts taking to the @entity237 underground to this end , they have launched @entity47			2
through the campaign , the charity are asking for student teachers to be trained how to teach young people to look after their health and that all secondary school students have time set aside in the curriculum to learn about health issues			1
they ask that people write to their teachers or mps demanding this is installed into secondary schools			2
' that is the big one , ' @entity10 said , ' i will die a very happy woman if we achieve that one			2
' the charity this week launched their # @entity258 campaign - appealing to the lingerie world to introduce a small label reminding women to check themselves in bras sold in the @entity134			1
@entity95 and @entity10 ( front left ) take part in one of the charity 's campaigns			0

cancer is the most common cause of death in young women ( 15 per cent ) and the fourth most common in young men ( 9 per cent ) , according to @entity135			1
however , less than one per cent of the total cancer deaths occur in 15 - 24 year olds			1
the scheme attracted a certain amount of controversy by anti page 3 campaigners who saw it as the newspaper 's way of advocating topless modelling while cancer charities argued it trivialised the disease			1
one charity @entity305 , said using @entity306 would be seen as ' ill - judged and insensitive ' by patients or relatives			1
prolific campaign group @entity309 furthermore questioned why it was necessary to use ' sexualised ' topless images to promote health messages			0
in response , @entity10 said : ‘ it has been 80 per cent positive			0
' a lot of people are upset by it			0
but in order to get our message across we have to do things that may upset some people			0
' as her work continues to go from strength to strength , @entity10 added that , as much as she loves her work , she will always put her health first			0
