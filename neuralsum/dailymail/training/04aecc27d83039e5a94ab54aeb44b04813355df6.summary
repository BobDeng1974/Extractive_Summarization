by @entity0 published : 15:29 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 01:49 est , 1 august 2013 fishermen the world over are known for being prone to exaggerating the size of their catch			0
but a bizarre game of ' my one 's bigger than yours ' appears to have broken out between @entity8 president @entity7 and his @entity10 counterpart @entity9 , who have got their lines crossed over who has caught the biggest fish			1
just days after mr @entity7 claimed to have caught a giant pike on a fishing trip , his next door neighbour mr @entity9 has boasted about catching a man - sized catfish			1
@entity22 : mr @entity9 describing how mr @entity7 's pike was ' only this big ' when compared with the catfish he hauled from the @entity26 river earlier today @entity10 state television showed mr @entity9 telling a government meeting about how he had wrenched a 126lb ( 57kg ) catfish from the @entity25			1
during the boastful exchange , he did not mention mr @entity7 or where exactly he had landed the monster			0
but deputy prime minister @entity33 , who claimed to have witnessed the seismic event , said : ' it was as long as i am tall			0
' last week mr @entity7 claimed to have caught a pike weighing a whopping 46lb ( 21kg ) while fishing in @entity39			2
he described it as a ' gigantic animal '			0
it was the latest in a long string of macho exploits by the @entity46 leader , which drew scepticism and mockery on social media			0
fishy tale : last week mr @entity7 claimed to have caught this 46lb pike in @entity39 , although sceptics warned it probably weighed less than a quarter of that blogger and author @entity55 calculated the length , diameter and volume of the fish and said it could only have weighed ‘ 10 - 11kg ' and not 21kg			1
pro-opposition journalist @entity61 added that a fish with the density of a 21kg pike the size of the one caught by mr @entity7 would simply have sunk to the bottom of the lake			2
‘ a pike that heavy just could not swim , ’ mr @entity61 wrote on @entity67			0
‘ she would sink to the bottom ! in fact this pike was made from granite			0
’ a caption placed under two online pictures - one of mr @entity7 holding the fish and the other showing prime minister @entity77 emerging from a river in a wetsuit with a satisfied look - read : ‘ wonder who planted that fish for @entity7 to catch ? ’ although @entity83 is @entity8 's closest ally , the relationship between @entity9 , 58 , and @entity7 , 60 , has long been uneasy			1
the pair have exchanged critical and sometimes sarcastic comments about each other for years as @entity9 has resisted the strengthening of @entity8 's influence over its smaller neighbour			2
now that 's a catfish : in 2005 this beast , similar to that caught by mr @entity9 , was pulled out of the @entity95 in @entity96			1
sadly photographic evidence of mr @entity9 's catch has not been released			2

@entity9 boasts 126lb catfish catch from @entity26 river
the bold claim beats last week 's @entity105 's 46lb pike *proclamation*
the two leaders appear to be *locked* in a *bitter* game of fish *brinkmanship*
