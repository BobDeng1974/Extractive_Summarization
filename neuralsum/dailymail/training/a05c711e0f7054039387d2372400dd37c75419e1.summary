by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 05:21 est , 9 november 2012 updated : 06:14 est , 9 november 2012 it is only day one of seven at @entity5 's @entity4 in @entity6 , but already this delegate was struggling to stay awake			1
he was caught on camera letting out a wide yawn as outgoing president @entity10 gave a mammoth 100 - minute speech to open the event , which marks the country 's once - a - decade leadership transition			1
perhaps he 'd be advised to order a refill of the coffee in front of him if he 's to make it through the next six days of the 18th @entity4 at the @entity20			1
and it was n't as though his departing leader 's speech was too dull , as mr @entity10 warned that rampant corruption in the @entity4 could topple the regime			1
mr @entity10 said : ‘ if we fail to handle this issue well , it could prove fatal to the party , and even cause the collapse of the party and the fall of the state			2
’ stay awake ! a delegate lets out a gaping yawn during the 100 - minute speech by outgoing president @entity10 that opened the 18th @entity4 of the @entity4 more coffee ? the delegate was struggling to keep up despite it being the first day of the @entity4 - with six more to come political theatre : delegates attend the opening of the 18th @entity4 at the @entity20 in @entity6 today			1
@entity5 's ruling @entity4 is ushering in a new group of younger leaders side - by - side : president @entity10 ( left ) and former president @entity46 ( right ) attend the opening session mr @entity10 added senior officials should strengthen ‘ supervision over their families and their staff , and they should never seek any privilege ’			1
his warning comes after revelations that the close family of outgoing premier @entity57 was exposed as having amassed around £ 2billion in ‘ hidden riches ’			0
and on the eve of the congress , high - ranking politician @entity59 was formally expelled from the party , following the murder of @entity65 businessman @entity64 by @entity59 ’s wife @entity66 last november			0
the @entity59 scandal has overshadowed the handover of power and exposed infighting and horse trading among hard - liners and reformers			0
at the congress , mr @entity10 promised political reform – but he ruled out copying @entity77 - style democracy			1
he also said army generals must transform ‘ @entity5 into a maritime power ’ to ensure it could ‘ win a local war in the information age ’ to defend its territorial claims in the resource - rich seas off its coast			2
mr @entity10 ’s successor @entity88 will be unveiled next week and will officially take over in march			2
the all - male @entity90 , consisting of seven to nine politicians , will also be revealed			0
chosen behind closed doors , the committee is the apex of power in the country			0
speech : mr @entity10 called for an end to corruption in order for government to gain the trust of the @entity5 people screen on the green : school students sit outside to watch mr @entity10 delivering his keynote report high spirits : @entity5 hostesses jump before the opening session outside the @entity20 in @entity6 warm welcome : hostesses line up outside the opening session of the communist @entity4 at the @entity20 in @entity6 heavy security has surrounded the party congress which is in effect a rubber - stamp process and a show of unity and power scores of dissidents have been hauled away by security agents or placed under house arrest			1
delegates filed into @entity6 's @entity20 , bedecked with red banners , and the congress was declared open after the national anthem played			0
the 2,268 delegates are drawn from the 82million - member party where the real deal - making is done by a few dozen power - brokers behind the scenes , even as @entity5 is ever more connected to the world through trade and the @entity134			2
in a speech aimed at outlining the successes of the past five years and challenges for the future , mr @entity10 said : ' we are faced with unprecedented opportunities for developments as well as risks			1
the party must keep in mind the trust of the people			0
' the fight against corruption remains a serious challenge for us			0
' coming so soon after president @entity152 's re-election in the @entity153 , the congress has drawn unfavourable comparisons from politically minded @entity5 who have bemoaned how little direct influence they have in choosing their leaders			1
segway security : police officers on patrol outside the @entity20 ( background ) as the 19th @entity4 gets underway grand design : delegates listen as mr @entity10 ( unseen ) delivers his address rush hour : people at @entity169 walk past a giant tv screen broadcasting the opening session momentous day : paramilitary policemen salute as the national flag is raised at sunrise on @entity175 ' i am doing nothing but staring at the television before @entity152 gets re-elected			1
as for @entity5 's party congress , there is no need for me to worry			2
on the contrary , it would be a waste of my time , ' @entity182 , a celebrity entrepreneur who co-founded a successful chain of @entity185 cram schools , said on a @entity5 version of @entity191 where he has six million followers			0
to many @entity5 , @entity5 is at an inflection point			0
its old model of heavily state - directed growth that lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty and made @entity5 an economic powerhouse is sputtering in the face of rising domestic debt and a weak global economy			2
meanwhile , the government has to contend with the public 's continued expectations of higher living standards and for less corruption and greater accountability , if not outright democracy			0
in @entity175 , adjacent to the congress venue , a woman in her 30s threw pieces of torn paper into the air and shouted ' bandits and robbers ! ' in the early morning before she was taken away by security forces			0
on the eve of the congress , four ethnic tibetans in @entity222 province set themselves on fire in protests against @entity5 rule of @entity229 areas , @entity219 - based rights group @entity218 said , adding that the timing of the protests appeared aimed at sending a signal to the @entity5 leadership .			1

ruling @entity4 today opened congress to usher in new group of younger leaders faced with challenging task of righting flagging economy
president @entity10 called for an end to *institutional* corruption in order for government to gain the trust of the @entity5 people
but it was n't interesting enough for one delegate caught on camera letting out a wide yawn
