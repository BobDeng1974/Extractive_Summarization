' a shopkeeper weighs the sweets for the children ( left ) but he was later removed and the children helped themselves as the number of supermarkets increased @entity4 throws to @entity3 in an earlier version of the story ( left ) but later she is in jeans and batting too more sketches show how the world had become more urban by the 1970s			1

you have to look carefully , but the dog is now on a lead in the later version on the right seatbelts have been added in the picture , right , but safety was n't such a big issue in the earlier version @entity4 helpfully holds the tent for @entity3 ( left ) but they both get stuck in later ( right ) ' many of the early pictures show @entity3 and @entity4 playing nicely together , but in the later ones they are seen arguing and behaving a bit more like a typical brother and sister , ' she added			1
