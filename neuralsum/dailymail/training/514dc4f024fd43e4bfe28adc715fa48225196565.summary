the @entity0 is back and with it comes the usual array of compelling sub-plots and unanswered questions			2
will @entity4 come good ? what next for @entity5 ? is @entity6 able to build a defence as well as an attack ? are @entity10 ’s hamstrings an accident waiting to happen and what would that do to @entity13 , the runaway leaders ? @entity15 considers 10 reasons why we ca n’t wait for the @entity0 to return … so , is @entity18 still tired ? we may be just seven games into the new season , but @entity18 is already complaining of being fatigued			1
so much so , he asked @entity20 to leave him out of the starting xi for @entity24 's @entity23 qualifier against @entity25 on sunday			1
the @entity24 manager is expected to meet up with @entity18 when @entity28 travel to @entity29 on sunday			1
reports he has bought @entity18 a pillow for the long journey back to @entity34 are said to be wide of the mark			1
@entity18 , pictured in training for @entity28 on wednesday , is expected to face @entity29 this weekend @entity4 finding his feet we ’ve had the revelation that he ’s part yorkshireman but what @entity42 fans would far prefer is a reminder of @entity4 ’s striking ability			1
his pre-united goals - to - games ratio of 200:305 is simply incredible and he is arguably the best finisher in football			1
but he only has one goal in four for @entity42 and that is not good enough			1
is he over that terrible knee injury he suffered last season ? is he still adapting to the @entity0 ? answers to these questions ought to reveal themselves over the next couple of months , starting with monday ’s trip to @entity58			2
@entity4 celebrating his only goal so far for @entity42 following his loan move from @entity61 can @entity62 close the gap at the top in early kick - off ? giving @entity66 an early advantage does not seem like the smartest idea			1
but that is what @entity62 have done , falling five points behind after seven games			2
their inferior goal difference ( +7 versus @entity13 ’s +14 ) effectively makes that a six - point gap and also highlights that they need more goals			1
city need to address that gap quickly and start with a tricky home fixture against @entity79 on saturday			2
spurs ’ dire record against top - four sides however , will count in the champions ' favour			2
@entity85 celebrates his strike against @entity87 in @entity62 's 2 - 0 victory before the international break can @entity90 repeat last season ’s shock by beating @entity13 ? march 29 – palace 1 @entity13 0			1
it was one of the most stunning results of the season , playing a huge role in @entity90 ’s survival and @entity13 ’s failure to win the title			1
@entity90 are not facing the same struggles in the early part of this season as last , but it would be a monumental upset if @entity13 lost on saturday			1
@entity105 put through his own net to hand @entity90 a shock win against @entity13 last season what will happen to @entity10 ’s mysterious hamstrings ? he has been the missing link			1
@entity66 did plenty of moaning last season about his striking options and @entity10 has proven just how useful an in - form predator can be			2
his tally for the season is a stunning nine in seven @entity0 games , which goes a fair distance to explaining their early dominance			0
but he is operating under a cloud , with @entity66 frequently citing the fragility of his hamstrings			0
they have been problematic for him in the past , though @entity125 recently smirked when asked if he thought @entity66 ’s regular mentions of problems were a smokescreen			0
if they are an issue , it would surely have a drastic effect on @entity13 ’s season			1
@entity10 ended his 515 - minute barren run for @entity135 when he scored against @entity136 on sunday life after @entity138 it ’s lost on very few that @entity28 have 10 points and sit ninth compared with 16 points and top spot at this time last season			2
one worrying truth is that @entity28 ’s fast start last season owed little to @entity147 , who was serving another of his biting bans			0
his impact was felt from roughly this time of year and onwards , so it will be fascinating to see how they go from here on in			0
they play at @entity29 on sunday			2
sack race – who will go next ? so far only @entity156 has come in during the campaign , which is fairly standard as historically this unsavoury aspect of a season does n’t tend to get going until november			0
there are suggestions that @entity163 ’s position is under threat , with @entity165 reportedly lined up to step into his role			0
and @entity167 is the subject of near constant speculation , either from the stands or smoking porches of @entity173 pubs			1
@entity174 is forever considered to be in range of a boot to the backside , but @entity179 ’s fine start ought to have allayed those suspicions			0
@entity167 's @entity5 have endured a difficult start to the season			1
his position is the subject of speculation @entity6 has to prove he can build a defence @entity6 has often faced questions on his ability to build a defence as capable as his attacks			0
it is often cited that his exciting team at @entity192 had the firepower to continue defying the odds by staying up , but were undermined too much by a leaky backline			0
now his @entity197 side are sitting 17th with the worst record for goals conceded in the division – 16			0
to make the issue even more clear , they have scored 13 , which is bettered only by @entity13 and @entity62			1
so it is obvious where the problem lies			0
and it is down to @entity6 to prove what he can do at both ends of the pitch			0
@entity212 on target in @entity197 's defeat at @entity42 , but their problems lie in defence @entity167 and the @entity5 situation will he walk away ? will @entity218 swallow the cost of paying off the remainder of his contract and sack him ? will he get the best out of these players and end the discussion ? certainly , there is trouble in the north			1
hefty chunks of the support are neither behind the board nor the manager and the team sit in the bottom three			2
the @entity236 effect it turns out that reports of @entity240 ’s demise were greatly exaggerated , to adapt a cliche			0
@entity236 has had a stunning effect since taking over , with this club continuing to prove its survival skills			0
it was expected to perish after @entity246 left , when @entity247 left , when @entity248 left … but still @entity240 are going strong			0
their squad acknowledge that @entity250 was a tricky patch for them last season , but they have a good run of fixtures coming up and will need to build up steam ahead of another tough festive schedule			0
@entity240 are third in the table having lost just one of their opening seven matches of the new campaign			0

@entity263 in the game of the weekend on saturday *afternoon*
@entity4 will bid to add to his first goal for @entity42
@entity18 will meet up with @entity20 after their ' tired ' *row*
leaders @entity13 face a short trip to play @entity90
and what 's next for @entity5 and their under - fire manager @entity167 ?
