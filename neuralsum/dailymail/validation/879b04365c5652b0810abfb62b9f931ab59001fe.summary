it 's not time to play the music			1
for @entity2 has said the building of his ‘ brand ’ after @entity5 — possibly in a recording studio — must not cloud his determination to win a third world championship			1
@entity2 has been a regular at showbusiness events in the close season , but now his red private jet has touched down in @entity12 and his focus has switched to the defence of his title in the opening race of the campaign			1
nonetheless , his life is something of a juggling act			1
yes , winning races is by far the most important thing , yet he has engaged transatlantic pr and talent agencies to polish his image after a split from @entity27 , who shaped ‘ @entity28 ’			2
@entity2 wants to replicate the scenes that followed after his second world championship title @entity2 ( left ) has been pictured alongside @entity31 and @entity32 since his triumph @entity2 is adamant his growing profile will not distract him from matters on the racing track @entity2 has never hidden his passion for music , posting @entity39 snaps playing guitar is that ‘ brand ’ something @entity2 wants to replicate ? ‘ at the moment , it ’s winning championships that counts , ’ he said			1
‘ i do n’t wish to stop racing but i ’m conscious i ’m halfway through my career , or maybe gone past halfway , and that the next six , seven or however many years i get will come and go			2
whatever steps i take now will determine what i do after			2
‘ i do n’t want to be a commentator , although i think i ’d be ok at it because i obviously know a lot about the sport , but there are other things i would like to try			2
so it ’s exploring those and building a foundation			2
’ does that mean music ? ‘ i ’m continuing to plod along and enjoy my music when i get time , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ but i have n’t been in the studio since january , and just for a couple of days			2
that ’s the least music i ’ve done during a winter for some time			2
‘ music is more of my life than people are aware of			2
when you ’re doing music you have a choice of how much you want to show and how vulnerable you want to be			0
i approach it just as a hobby , something i enjoy			0
‘ i like to have feedback from people who are experienced			0
i ’ve never been tempted to release anything but i ’ve not had the worst of comments about my songs , either			0
’ @entity2 has spoken about several post-career avenues , including an acting role in @entity82			1
he rules out very little			0
@entity2 admits that he wants to explore his creative side when he is away from @entity5 @entity2 ( right ) presented an honour at the brit awards alongside @entity86 @entity2 described his @entity88 team - mate @entity87 as ' an honourable , respectful man ' ‘ growing up , i was restricted in knowing , learning and being made aware of my creative side , ’ he said of a young lifetime spent going from kart track to kart track under the eyes of his controlling father , @entity94 , and the strict discipline of @entity96			1
‘ there are things i ’m really quite creative at , so i ’m going to see where that takes me			1
i am good at designing			0
i did my whole house			0
i have done my steering wheel for some time			0
i might indulge in trying to design clothes or something			0
just do my own stuff			0
i ’d like to do something with cars			0
’ which brings us from hobbies back to business and a year in which @entity2 ’s @entity88 team will again dominate , according to the crushing figures from pre-season testing			1
that sets up a private duel : @entity2 versus @entity87 , the sequel			1
their relationship became rancorous last season but ended with a hug in @entity123			1
it was a magnanimous gesture from the vanquished @entity87			0
‘ an honourable , respectful man , ’ was @entity2 ’s verdict at @entity88 ’ factory in @entity127 last week			1
‘ my relationship with @entity87 is as good as 12 months ago , ’ he added			0
‘ it seems quite good , to be honest			0
but it ’s when you get in the heat of the moment and there ’s ... you know , you have to assume there ’s going to be moments where there ’s going to be bits of tension , but that ’s because we ’re fierce competitors			0
@entity2 insisted he is unfazed by @entity87 's efforts to beat him in the upcoming season @entity2 is confident that he will be able to defend his title in the season that starts in @entity12 ‘ you are conflicted because you are trying to get the team to win , but you also want to win yourself			1
we managed it well , particularly at the end of last season			1
’ @entity87 , whose wife @entity152 is expecting their first baby in august ( classic @entity156 efficiency — a birth in the sport ’s summer break , as one of his lieutenants observed ) , has said publicly he can win the title			1
‘ you have to assume each driver is going to get better , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’m sure @entity87 is training harder			0
i ’m sure he is studying more and trying everything under the sun to make sure he finishes ahead of me			0
that ’s what i ’ve been facing since i was 10 so it ’s no different , really			0

@entity2 admits he likes to explore his creative talents away from @entity5
the world champion has been seen at a number of showbiz events lately
but the @entity88 driver is *desperate* to defend his title this season
