by @entity0 published : 17:25 est , 20 july 2013 updated : 06:52 est , 21 july 2013 rising star : @entity3 , 25 has honed her craft at an acting course at the @entity6 of @entity7 and is landing lead roles in the week that @entity12 was revealed to have written a crime thriller under a male pseudonym , a star of the @entity11 films has told of her own secret : that she nearly quit showbusiness			1
@entity3 – who found fame as the first girl to kiss @entity11 in the blockbuster films – admitted she suffered a massive crisis of confidence because she felt a fraud as an actress			1
she was a 16 - year - old @entity7 schoolgirl with no acting experience when she was picked from 3,000 hopefuls at an open casting for the role of @entity28 in @entity29 in 2004			1
but while her @entity31 co-stars used the @entity11 franchise as a stepping stone to greater things , @entity3 turned to photography , completing a degree course at @entity37 however , after four years out of the limelight , the draw of showbusiness proved too strong			1
now 25 , @entity3 is 12 months into a three - year acting course at the @entity6 of @entity7 and last week starred in the gritty @entity43 @entity42 , which will be released on dvd tomorrow			1
she has also played the lead in the first stage adaptation of @entity48 ’s @entity47 and has a number of other roles lined up			2
‘ i will always be grateful for the opportunity the @entity11 films gave me			1
but i came away from them thinking that i did n’t feel like a real actor , ’ said @entity3 , who was a pupil at an independent school near her home in @entity53 , @entity54 , when her father took her to @entity56 for the @entity11 casting			1
‘ i felt a big part of what happened to me was based on luck			0
i did work very hard in the auditions and gave it my best shot			0
' but i also was n’t certain i wanted to rely on acting as a career because of the uncertainty of it			0
it has taken a while but now i feel more comfortable within myself			0
' i ’ve still got plenty to work on with my acting but with each role my confidence is growing			2
’ @entity3 paints a comical picture of her first day on a summer acting course at the @entity6			1
she said : ‘ we had to say our name , where we came from and any acting experience we ’d had , so i did n’t see the point in hiding anything			0
‘ so i said , “ hi , my name is @entity3 , i ’m from @entity53 , and i ’ve been in the @entity11 movies			1
” at that point someone shouted , “ i knew it ! i thought you looked familiar ! ” it was one of those hilarious moments			0
’ bright young things : @entity3 ( right ) joined the @entity11 cast and acted with @entity95 ( centre ) and @entity97 ( left ) at the age of 16 @entity99 : @entity3 ( pictured with @entity11 co-star @entity100 ) said she is grateful for her big break but spent four years leading a normal life out of the limelight it is the sort of modesty which would chime with author ms @entity12 – who was last week unmasked as the author of @entity107 , under the pseudonym @entity107			1
that short course and the unstinting encouragement of @entity3 ’s tutor persuaded her she might just have what it took to be an actor after all			1
shortly afterwards , she landed the part of a lifetime – as @entity48 in @entity47			0
the story is @entity28 ’s bestselling account of the lives of three generations of @entity122 women – and it had a profound effect on @entity3 , whose divorced parents are of @entity122 descent			1
she said : ‘ it ’s probably the moment i decided i really did want to be an actor			0
being on stage and having the immediate response from the audience made me feel really good about what i was doing			0
' to see how it affected people , and for people to say they enjoyed it , really made it special			0
’ her mother , @entity140 , flew from @entity141 to see her daughter tread the boards			0
she has lived in the former @entity145 colony since her marriage ended when @entity3 was three			1
@entity3 ’s father , @entity147 , a millionaire who runs a restaurant and food wholesale business in @entity150 , raised @entity3 and her brother , @entity151 , who is a year younger			1
the @entity11 role – and that first kiss for @entity11 – led to jealous comments on the internet although @entity3 says she was n’t ‘ bothered too much by any of it ’			1
close : @entity3 aged three with her father , @entity147			1
she was raised by her father , a millionaire who runs a restaurant and food wholesale business in @entity150 all grown up : @entity3 starred as @entity161 in tv series @entity162			1

by her side throughout the past few years has been her boyfriend , recruitment consultant @entity173 , a close friend of her brother @entity151			0
she and @entity173 first started chatting online as they played games of @entity177			2
she said : ‘ we have different personalities – that ’s why it works			0
and if i have confidence issues , he ’s always been there for me			2
’ @entity3 has just spent two weeks in the @entity185 filming an episode for the @entity189 ’s @entity188 crime drama series			1
she admits that thanks to @entity173 she has become something of a gaming addict			0
and after filming , the first thing she did when she returned to the new home she shares with @entity173 was switch on the @entity198 games console – and crack open a beer ! disarmingly , she said : ‘ that ’s what i really like to do more than anything			1
i find killing zombies and games like @entity177 really therapeutic			0
if i could be a bloke and do things like that all the time , i ’d be in heaven			0
’ role of a lifetime : the 25 - year - old bagged the lead part in the @entity214 's production of @entity47 last year her next role means she will miss a month of drama school to play the lead in @entity218 at the @entity219 , in @entity56			2

the play is due to begin its month - long run on september 25			2
she admitted : ‘ i ’m over the moon but scared too			0
i hope i can do the part justice			0
’ with several serious roles under her belt , @entity3 has confessed she no longer feels like a ‘ fraud ’			2
she said : ‘ @entity11 was so huge , it took me a few years to get to the point where i realised i would rather die than sit in an office nine to five			2
' but the indecision has gone and now i ’m committed to acting			0
’ it is clear @entity3 is determined to make up for lost time .			2
