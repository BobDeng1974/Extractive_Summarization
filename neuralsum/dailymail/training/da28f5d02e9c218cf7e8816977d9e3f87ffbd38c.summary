@entity0 , 24 , from @entity1 , @entity2 , pleaded guilty to manslaughter when her one - year - old son was pulled limp and lifeless from an overfilled bath , drunken @entity0 screamed with rage and blamed those around her			1
she lied to paramedics and even said her other son – aged only three – was responsible for the tragedy			0
but as she was jailed for almost four years yesterday , the young mother of two had to face up to the fact that just one person was truly to blame : herself			1
@entity15 had left little @entity16 in the bath , with only his older brother @entity18 for company , while she spent 45 minutes chatting with neighbours outside her home in @entity22 , @entity2			1
she told one that she was ‘ so drunk ’ on vodka			0
by the time the mother – a foul - mouthed , binge - drinking , cannabis - smoking 24 - year - old – thought to check on her sons , the water in the bath was full to the overflow			1
@entity16 died in hospital four days later , the day after his first birthday			2
yesterday @entity15 , who admitted manslaughter when she appeared in court last month , broke into choking sobs as she was sentenced			1
‘ you totally abandoned your responsibilities as the mother of a baby at bathtime , ’ said judge @entity37			0
‘ you completely overlooked the risk to him of being unattended and not just for a moment or two , but for a very long time			0
’ compounding her neglect , @entity15 repeatedly lied , first to paramedics whom she reduced to tears with her display of anger , then to other members of the emergency team , claiming she had left the children for just a few minutes			1
today , as she begins her 45 - month sentence , the @entity56 can reveal the extent of her feckless behaviour			2
her appearance at @entity62 yesterday was by no means her first brush with the law			0
six years ago , a sobbing @entity65 , then only 18 , stood in the dock at the @entity67 charged with murder			2
she was accused , with two 17 - year - old boys , of beating a trainee fitness instructor to death , while another man filmed the attack on his mobile phone			2
@entity15 was jailed for 45 months at @entity62 , pictured above , for manslaughter of her son @entity77 after she left him and his brother @entity18 unsupervised in a bath for up to 50 minutes @entity15 was said to have encouraged @entity81 and @entity82 , who kicked and punched @entity83 , 30 , to death , then stripped him naked and left his body in a rubbish - strewn hallway			1
@entity81 was found guilty of murder and @entity82 of manslaughter			1
@entity15 , who claimed she tried to stop the attack , was cleared of murder and the jury failed to reach a verdict on an alternative count of manslaughter			1
the prosecution subsequently dropped the case			0
in the aftermath , the teenage @entity65 was forced to leave the housing association semi in @entity98 , @entity2 , where she lived with single mother @entity100 , 44 , moving to nearby @entity101			1
stability appeared to beckon for @entity15 when she met her partner , whom the @entity56 can not name for legal reasons			2
the couple already had @entity18 when they moved to the flats in @entity22 in late 2009			2
but @entity15 swiftly upset neighbours and was often heard shouting			1
@entity18 was once even seen wandering through a car park , alone and wearing only a vest			2
‘ she was always smoking drugs , cannabis , ’ said a neighbour who did not want to be named			2
‘ she would come over swearing and shouting			0
i had to call the police on her so many times			0
‘ most of the time she was living here i felt i could n’t stay here , i went to my mum ’s quite a lot			0
‘ it ’s pretty much all drink - related			0
i ’ve seen her outside smoking cannabis before and even with the windows closed you could smell it			1
she was smoking cannabis on the day she brought the baby home			1
’ the scene : @entity15 left her sons alone in a bath in a block of flats in @entity22 , @entity2 , pictured above , to drink wine with her neighbours the neighbour was at home on the day in september last year that the tragedy happened			1
it was mid-afternoon when the woman spotted @entity15 ’s partner leave , and heard her chatting with another neighbour			1
she recalled : ‘ when she first came out she said , “ i ’m so drunk			0
” i said , “ have you been drinking wine ? ” and she said , “ no , vodka , i ’ve had so much vodka ”			0
we kept hearing @entity18 screaming and she kept shouting , “ @entity155 , sit down ”			1
’ puzzled , she asked if the little boy was trying to climb over the stairgate , but was told by @entity15 the toddler was in the bath			1
‘ @entity16 was never mentioned and i just thought he would be sleeping , ’ she said			2
‘ it did n’t cross my mind that he was in the bath too			0
’ incredibly , the neighbour heard @entity15 shout instructions to @entity18 to turn the shower on to amuse himself			1
‘ it was n’t until about 40 minutes later that she said she was going to get @entity18 out of the bath and dressed , and went in			1
‘ about 15 seconds later she slung the back door open and was screaming my name with the baby over her shoulder			0
she literally threw him to me			0
‘ we had the baby on the kitchen floor			0
she said he ’d had a fit , she did n’t tell us he was in the bath			0
his lips were blue , his eyes were slightly open and we were pumping his chest and doing mouth - to - mouth			0
‘ it was only later we saw the bath and it was full to the overflow			0
’ as panic ensued , @entity18 remained in the bath , and it was another neighbour who scooped the boy from the water			1
when emergency services arrived one ambulance crew member was left so distressed by the screaming @entity15 that she said : ‘ i could n’t work out if she was distressed , shocked or just plain horrible			1
’ tellingly , the response of @entity15 ’s brother when he arrived at the hospital was : ‘ was she p * * * * * ? ’ another resident of the flats claimed social services had been told of the mother ’s cannabis smoking			1
so what of @entity15 now ? her mother @entity100 had a sharp retort when approached by a @entity56 reporter			2
‘ do one , ’ she said , giving some insight into where her daughter got her unpleasant tongue			0
meanwhile back in @entity22 , @entity213 , who has lived in @entity15 ’s three - storey block for 22 years , told the @entity56 : ‘ i will never forget that day			2
the ambulance came and she [ @entity15 ] looked up at me and said , “ it ’s all your fault ”			0
‘ i do n’t know why she said it			0
but the policeman who came said to me , “ do n’t worry , she just wanted to blame somebody ”			0
