by @entity0 for @entity1 ' brilliant , beautiful ' @entity2 died of a @entity3 in 2011 , aged 18			1
he is pictured here at 15 are addicts born that way ? the nature vs nurture question is one that 's preoccupied composer @entity9 for longer than he can recall			1
he beat his own demons – drink was his – by the time he was 30 , but when his children came along , the questions ( ' for which i still do not have answers ' ) became more pertinent			2
he veers towards the idea there 's an addictive ' gene ' , something we 're either born with or not , something that may kill us or not			2
' my daughter @entity23 does n't have it , ' he explains , talking of his youngest , who is about to go to university			2
' she does n't have that obsessive , compulsive thing			2
' his son @entity28 , though – ' brilliant , beautiful @entity28 ' – did have it			1
he saw it in him almost before the little boy could walk			2
' he had to throw himself into everything 100 per cent			2
he did n't just drink his orange squash , he 'd guzzle it			2
@entity28 never approached things , he attacked them			1
he took up ping - pong , and ended up representing his country			2
' by the time he was 18 he 'd decided he was going to be a songwriter			1
being @entity28 , he was going to be the best songwriter in the world			1
' when @entity28 got involved in drugs he threw himself 100 per cent into that too , dying from a heroin overdose in 2011 at just 18			1
his death made headlines because of his connections			2
his mother was the celebrated cartoonist @entity48 ; musician @entity49 was a good friend			0
what only emerged later was that he 'd been a friend of @entity51 too , and it 's probable they did drugs together			1
in a diary entry a few weeks before his death he wrote that @entity51 was going to visit him later and he was going to ' inject for the first time '			1
after @entity28 , pictured left , died , his father @entity57 said @entity51 , pictured right , a friend of @entity28 's , phoned to beg him not to reveal her drug addiction to her father @entity60 @entity28 , pictured here the year he died , wrote in a diary entry weeks before his death that @entity51 was coming to visit and he would ' inject for the first time ' inevitably the conversation with @entity9 turns to @entity51 , and her death in april this year , with its striking echoes of his son 's			1
mr @entity2 said of @entity51 ' death : ' it never really surprises me any more when i hear about youngsters dying of heroin overdoses ' ' was i surprised ? not desperately , ' he says , ' i was n't expecting her to die , but i knew she knew @entity28 well			1
i knew she 'd been having a rough time			2
it never really surprises me any more when i hear about youngsters dying of heroin overdoses , because it happens so much			0
' peaches called @entity9 the day after his son died , but he was furious that she was preoccupied with ensuring her name was n't linked with his			1
' she was far more concerned about getting into trouble if her father ever found out			0
at the time i thought she was being a spoilt little brat , but now i realise the poor girl was going through hell and could n't help herself			2
now i just feel desperately sorry for her family			0
' with hindsight one wonders what would have happened if @entity9 had lifted the phone and called @entity60 himself			1
he says that never occurred to him			0
' at that time i was n't sure she was using			2
i knew that towards the very , very end she paid @entity28 to go and buy drugs and he visited her in @entity97 , but to be honest , by the time @entity28 died the last thing i was thinking about was anybody but him			1
' he bears no rancour			0
' i do n't know if she taught him to inject			2
' it looks that way , but it does n't really matter			0
if it had n't been her , it would have been someone else			0
now i just think it 's so bloody sad			0
' his interest in the subject of addiction led to his involvement in a @entity113 project called @entity114 , for which he worked for several months with drug and alcohol addicts who used to be musicians			1
@entity9 , pictured with his wife @entity119 and daughter @entity23 at their home in @entity123 in 2011 , works with addicts who were formerly musicians it 's a harrowing programme , with some of the most talented souls possible opening up about how they lost almost everything to addiction			1
@entity9 acts partly as musical director , partly as counsellor as , assisted by members of the @entity134 , they 're tasked with working together to write and perform their own composition			1
it 's challenging , emotional and stressful – and not all of them see the project through to the end			0
@entity9 says @entity28 was the inspiration for the programme			1
' he was curious about the idea of music as an addiction therapy			0
i remember him saying once , " i wonder if music could be a way to recovery			0
" ' @entity9 picked the world of classical music partly because he wanted to show that ' addiction is n't confined to rock bands and film stars			1
ordinary middle - class people have it as well			0
' peaches was found dead in april this year at her home in @entity161 , @entity97			0
she had 3mg per litre of diamorphine , the chemical name for heroin , in her blood mr @entity9 said he was initially annoyed that @entity51 , pictured left with her husband @entity167 , and right , had tried to cover her own back so soon after @entity28 's death - but he now realises she was ' going through hell ' it seems @entity28 was riddled with insecurity from an early age , even though he was a high - achiever			1
' @entity28 was beyond bright – he was brilliant			1
but he never liked himself			0
i remember he did n't like looking in the mirror when he was two , which was so strange			0
as he got older he had very little self - esteem			0
he never thought he was loved , even though he was adored – it 's extraordinary how many people came to his funeral			0
' @entity28 had his first cigarette at nine , on holiday in @entity185 when he sneaked off with a friend ; his first drink , a @entity187 , stolen from his au pair 's fridge , not long after			1
by the time he was 14 he was experimenting with lsd and the stimulant drug mephedrone			1
@entity9 says he and his ex-wife @entity119 ( they split up in 2006 , just as @entity28 was slipping into torment ) ' tried everything ' to help			1
in 2008 they sent him to a ' tough love ' rehab camp in @entity199			0
later , they watched helpless as he was sectioned and admitted to the @entity201 in @entity202			0
did @entity9 blame himself for what happened ? ' non-stop			1
i ca n't tell you how many times i 've beaten myself up for all the things i could have done better , or differently			0
' to hurl himself into a project that stirred up all the old emotions must have been hard			0
' yes , but it 's better to confront them than bury them			0
' he says seeing the participants make music together at the end of a painful process was ' the most uplifting thing imaginable			0
these were people getting their lives back , and proving it 's possible to do so			0
' only for some , sadly			0
@entity114 will be shown on thursday 28 august at 11pm on @entity113 .			1
