ms @entity0 , said : ' my right breast was bright red and swollen and i felt weak and shaky			2
' the surgeon cut some tissue away from the breast which he thought might be infected			0
' but the infection gradually ate a hole in my right breast the size of a 10 - pence piece			2
' the pain was unbearable			0
' @entity0 had the string implant removed from her right breast , however , the left one was already too embedded to be taken out			1

' even now i have some residual string in my right breast - i do n't think i 'll ever be free of it all			2
' i was lied to and told the operation had been approved by the medical authority , but it had n't			0

' she says the remaining string implant is causing fluid to leak into both breasts making them to balloon			1
for the last eight years she has been cared for by dr @entity144 , an expert in plastic and reconstructive surgery			0
dr @entity144 said : ' over the years i 've seen cases of polypropylene string implants but i 've never seen a case quite like @entity0 's - her future is uncertain			1
' i presented her case at the local medical society and the sentiment was she needed a double mastectomy			2
' however , the years of operations have decimated @entity0 's breast tissue , and she is unwilling to face more risky surgery			1

' but i would n't wish this on anyone and i hope my story will act as a warning			0
