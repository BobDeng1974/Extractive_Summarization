by @entity1 reporter published : 02:59 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 05:57 est , 6 august 2013 most brides have a dream wedding that they try to create for their special day			0
for this bride , it 's perhaps questionable whether this was what she envisioned for her wedding day for all those years			0
regardless , it 's clear from the beaming smiles on the faces of both the bride and groom , as they stand knee deep in freezing , flowing waters of a salmon river in @entity18 , that this is the perfect wedding for them			1
@entity40 and @entity24 , both local fishing guides , opted for a rather nontraditional salmon fishing theme for their entire wedding			0
the couple 's rings were presented each in the mouths of two king salmon and both the bridesmaids and groomsmen were carrying fishing rods complete with flower posies throughout the ceremony			1
stunning setting : it was arguably a beautiful setting for the ceremony , with @entity57 in the background			0
the majority of the wedding party kept their feet dry , watching from the shoreline unafraid of getting their hands messy , the couple then caught their own pair of pink salmon to commemorate their special union shortly after the newlyweds were married , they were each handed a rod and both caught their own pair of handsome pink salmon on the @entity77 , on @entity18 's southern @entity78			1
while marrying in the freezing fishy waters of a fast - flowing river in @entity18 might not be everyone 's cup of tea for their special ceremony , @entity80 and mrs @entity24 , it appears , could n't have been happier with the arrangement			2
the setting might be unusual but some elements of the special day followed the traditional course , including @entity23 's minor make - up touch - ups from the bridesmaids impressed : clearly enjoying the salmon - themed wedding , one groomsman stopped to watch with awe as two large king salmon are removed from the ceremony			2

couple exchange vows knee - deep in the @entity77 , in @entity102 , @entity18
wedding rings presented in the mouths of two king salmon
