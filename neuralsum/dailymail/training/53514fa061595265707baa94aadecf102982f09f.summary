in a statement late tuesday , @entity53 confirmed the hard - working mother , who has no criminal convictions would have her case reviewed			1
' @entity53 is presently conducting a review of ms. @entity27 's case , therefore her removal is not imminent at this time , ' agency spokesman @entity58 told @entity34			2
tears : @entity1 , pictured with her three @entity10 - born children @entity49 , 11 , right , @entity65 , 6 , center , and @entity51 , 4 , left , was told monday that she had to leave @entity45 said he hopes the government gives his wife another chance			1
' hopefully , they 'll have a change of heart , ' @entity45 told @entity34			0
' i hope they find it in their hearts not to split up a family			2
' the review comes after @entity1 's heartbreaking case made national headlines yesterday and prompted an outpouring of support			2
her @entity83 - based immigration attorney @entity82 said the review was a good first step but he was still cautious			2
' so far so good , though she still has an ankle bracelet on and i do n't like the language that says she 's not in danger of " imminent " deportation , ' he told @entity92 , adding that he was trying to get more detailed information from officials			1
the concerned father said the whole ordeal has had a devastating impact on the couple 's three children			2
' the girls want to know why they 're not going to school			2
they 're on pins and needles , ' @entity45 said			0
devastating : @entity1 , pictured right , who came to the @entity106 seeking asylum 13 years ago , was ordered to report for deportation at @entity13 at 10:30 a.m. tuesday for a flight back to her native @entity39 @entity1 was ordered to report for deportation at 10:30 a.m. tuesday for a flight back to her native @entity39 after receiving a letter from authorities monday telling her to pack her bags			1
however , in a desperate bid to buy time , she deliberately missed the deadline , and was waiting at home with her family for authorities to take her into custody when she learned of the review			1
' there is a level of insanity in this case , ' @entity82 told @entity92 earlier on tuesday as he fought to keep @entity1 with her husband and children			1
' someone is not doing what is ordinarily done			0
there is an abuse of power			0
' @entity1 is the sole carer of her elderly mother - in - law , another @entity10 citizen , whose toes were amputated and needs help eating , walking and washing			1
but her case for political asylum was rejected after a judge said her testimony about fearing the prostitution trade and criminal activity in @entity39 lacked credibility			2
he said even if her concerns were warranted ' young , attractive women are not a social group for asylum			0
' packing up : @entity1 , pictured center with her kids , chose not to go to the airport and remained at home with her packed bags , waiting for authorities but they did n't come seeking asylum : @entity1 came to the @entity10 through @entity37 in 2000 fearing that if she stayed in @entity39 she would be kidnapped and sold into prostitution			1
she immediately turned herself in and sought asylum after losing her appeal in 2008 , she was given a deportation order			0
an estimated 500,000 people are living in the @entity10 with a deportation order , however , @entity10 @entity17 and @entity18 only acts on a portion of cases and the @entity175 specifically said targeting people with criminal convictions was the priority			2
in fact , she 's a glowing member of her community , described by friends and her children 's teachers as a hard - working mother who pays her taxes and helps her kids with schoolwork , not to mention keeping her elderly mother - in - law out of a government - funded home			1
' @entity4 has gone off the map here , ' @entity82 said before the case review was announced			2
' they are doing something that has not been done around the country			0
this person probably has as many positive evaluations as you can , she has three children who are @entity10 citizens and has been here for a long time			1
' settled in : while here , she married @entity45 , who was born in @entity46 but moved here 40 years ago , and the couple had three kids , including @entity51 , 4 , pictured @entity1 became concerned about two weeks ago , when at her regular six - month check in with the deportation department she was fitted with a gps ankle bracelet			1
but the mother - of - three was convinced @entity53 would n't deport a woman whose three kids are @entity10 - born			1
' that is strange they put an ankle bracelet on a mom with three kids , ' @entity82 said , referring to the low risk of her fleeing			0
' then the day before her scheduled flight they said " you 're flying out tomorrow , here 's your information			1
" they did n't want the bad press			0
' i think they wanted it to look as natural as possible because they understood how egregious this case is			0
it just does n't make sense			0
' if officials did not decide to review her case , the authorities would have been forced to collect @entity1 from her home yesterday and take her into custody			1
at midday tuesday , she was pictured in her living room , with her family surrounding her awaiting @entity53 officers			2
@entity1 and her children were crying as they hugged by the christmas tree , and the woman 's mother - in - law was asking what would become of her if her daughter was sent home			1
other relatives , including a cousin , were visibly upset at the heartbreaking situation the family has been thrown into			0
hugs : @entity1 has not decided , if she is in fact deported , whether to take the kids , who have never been to @entity39 , with her review : the mother 's case will be reviewed ' they will jail her for one to three weeks , however long it takes to organize another flight , ' @entity82 told @entity92 of the process			1
' then border guards will drive her to the airport and take off her ankle bracelet like she 's a mass murderer or a terrorist going to @entity277			0
' @entity82 and the family were working desperately for someone in @entity280 to interject			0
' we need somebody in the @entity283 , connected to @entity53 , to say " stop this immediately			0
" if someone in @entity280 hears about this , that is our best chance			0
her story just has n't been heard			0
' understandably , @entity1 was beside herself , and was still trying to work out if she would take her children , who are enrolled in school and have never been to @entity39 , with her			1
her husband works as a cook at restaurant in @entity4 and said he ca n't afford to raise the children on his own			1
' she is an emotional mess , ' @entity82 explained			0
deportation : @entity1 was informed monday that she had to report at @entity305 's @entity304 terminal at 10:30 a.m. tuesday as per the above order empty : but the terminal , pictured , was empty at 10:30 a.m. tuesday , as the mother - of - three defied the order by staying home ' what she has been told by numerous people was that they do n't deport women with three @entity10 citizen children and that is exactly what they 're doing			1
' she is crying all the time , trying to work out who she can take and who she ca n't			1
she 's going back to @entity39 and that is not a good place to bring a 6 - year - old girl , particularly			1
' he added : ' it happened in one day , she has no idea what to do			0
' @entity45 told the @entity28 monday night the family was ' hoping for a miracle			2
