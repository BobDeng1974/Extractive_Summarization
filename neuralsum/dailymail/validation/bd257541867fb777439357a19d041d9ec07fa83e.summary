the @entity1 crew of the new @entity3 film triggered an international air safety alert by going on a drunken rampage aboard the official 007 jet			1
last night , the producers of the forthcoming @entity9 film confirmed that they were investigating the ' intimidatory and frightening ' behaviour on board the privately chartered plane flying from @entity13 in @entity14 to @entity15 11 days ago			1
last night , a worker at @entity42 airport in @entity15 said the mayhem had left the interior of the plane looking like a ' pack of wild animals ' had gone through it			1
the source added that vomit had been left inside the toilet and on the floor outside			0
the producers of the forthcoming @entity9 film , starring @entity54 and @entity55 , confirmed that they were investigating the ' intimidatory and frightening ' behaviour he also claimed the airline had to bring in a specialist firm to clean the plane at a cost of 20,000 pesos – about £ 1,000			1
the incident will prove embarrassing for @entity23 , which only yesterday launched a glossy trailer for the new £ 190 million movie , which will again star @entity55 as 007			2
about 150 of the film 's crew , including cameramen , technicians and stunt men , were on their way to @entity15 to film some of the most spectacular action sequences , including one that takes place during @entity15 's macabre @entity77 festival			1
it is understood that neither @entity55 nor any other member of the cast was on board the jet , which landed at @entity83 for the two - week shoot on march 18			2
@entity18 , which has told @entity23 that its staff breached the conditions of the charter , will deploy extra security at the airport to ensure that no passengers arrive drunk for the jet 's return journey to the @entity1 on wednesday			1
the airline has agreed to fly the crew back to @entity1 only on condition that no alcohol is served or consumed on board			0
the privately chartered plane ( pictured ) was flying from @entity13 in @entity14 to @entity15 11 days ago members of the film crew removed a safety pin from one of the aircraft 's doors - there is no suggestion those pictured were involved in rampage @entity23 , led by @entity110 and his stepsister @entity111 , have now told staff that the flight will be ' dry '			1
however , in a twist worthy of the @entity3 films , it is unclear whether the @entity118 watchdog , the @entity117 , is investigating the incident			1
on friday night , spokeswoman @entity120 confirmed that the incident was ' under investigation ' but declined to comment further after being given a detailed account of the reckless behaviour on the plane			2
but the following day her colleagues denied any such probe was under way			0
the @entity117 has some jurisdiction over international airspace around the @entity118 , which could have been passed through by the 007 film crew 's flight			1
a spokesman for @entity23 last night confirmed it was conducting an internal investigation to find out exactly what had happened			0
but @entity16 understands that @entity110 and @entity111 read the riot act to staff at a production meeting held shortly after the plane 's arrival in @entity15			1
they have also apologised to horrified air crew members			0
one source , who asked not to be named , said : ' @entity110 and @entity111 have both made it very clear that this sort of behaviour is unacceptable and should never be allowed to happen again			0
it is understood that neither @entity55 ( pictured ) nor any other member of the cast was on board the jet some of the film 's crew vomited and urinated in the aisles and verbally abused cabin crew - there is no suggestion those pictured were involved in rampage ' the behaviour of a handful of crew members got out of hand and made things very unpleasant for their fellow passengers			1
' @entity23 has apologised to all the crew members who had to endure this intolerable behaviour			2
' airline expert @entity169 said last night that ' it was entirely possible ' that the removal of the safety pin could have caused the door to open			1
he said : ' the pin is part and parcel of the locking mechanism on the aircraft door			2
essentially , if you remove it there is a possibility that you could potentially open the door and decompress the cabin			0
' however , while the risk was real , he added that in all likelihood the door would have been held shut by the speed of the plane moving through the air			0
@entity18 , which is based in @entity192 , leases its 12 airbuses to governments , companies and individuals			0
last night , a spokesman declined to comment on the incident			0
he said : ' this particular flight from the @entity1 to @entity15 was a private charter , not open to the public			2
we have an obligation towards the privacy rights of our clients and therefore we are unable to comment			0
' a spokesman for @entity23 said : ' we are investigating the matter so can not comment further at this time			0
' spectre is the 24th movie in the @entity3 franchise and co-stars @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity54			2
it is due to open in @entity1 in november .			0
