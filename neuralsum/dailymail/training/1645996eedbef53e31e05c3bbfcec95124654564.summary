by @entity0 a hi - tech ' virtual cadaver ' is being made available for teaching - so students can investigate the human anatomy at the touch of a screen			1
the device , at the @entity7 ’s @entity6 , will enable medical students to examine the human body by ‘ virtually dissecting it ’			2
dubbed the @entity13 , it shows life - sized male and female bodies created from ct scans , allowing the cadaver to be seen from front to back , side to side and upside down			1
virtual cadaver : the @entity13 will enable students to ' virtually dissect ' a human body life - sized : images of male and female bodies have been created from @entity16 , allowing the cadaver to be seen from front to back , side - to - side and upside down it means the body and the relationship of structures beneath the skin can be seen in great detail – and electronically			1
unlike the dissection of a real cadaver , in which body parts can only be removed , students can add or remove organs , veins , arteries , nerves or tissue by touching the table - enabling them to see how one part relates to another			2
@entity46 , professor of @entity47 , said : ‘ the beauty of the @entity13 is that you can rotate and view the body in all three planes in a unique @entity53 experience			0
‘ although it will never , i believe , replace the experience of dissecting and handling a real cadaver , it will allow students to handle a virtual cadaver without all the legislation that accompanies the use of real cadavers			0
researchers say it is possible to import personalised scans to the device , which can then be recreated into virtual cadavers and used in specially designed teaching packages students can add or remove organs , veins , arteries , nerves or tissue by touching the table - enabling them to see how one part relates to another @entity73 : body parts can be seen in great detail thanks to the touch - screen teaching tool ‘ so far we have received a lot of good feedback from the students and surgeons who have tested it out			1
’ researchers say it is possible to import personalised scans to the device , which can then be recreated into virtual cadavers and used in specially designed teaching packages			0
the device will be introduced into formal teaching sessions ‘ where appropriate ’ and will also be put on display for members of the public .			0
