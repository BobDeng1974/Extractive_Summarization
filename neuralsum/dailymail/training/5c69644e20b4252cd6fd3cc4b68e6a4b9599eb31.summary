the government plans to scrap roaming charges in the @entity75 by 2016 , although no set plans are in place for when exactly this will happen			0
this will of course mean holidaymakers travelling outside of this jurisdiction will still face high bills , though			0

holidaymakers in @entity92 , @entity56 , @entity57 ( @entity94 's @entity93 is pictured left ) @entity59 , @entity60 ( right ) and @entity61 can also use the service from today three describes the scheme as ‘ a new , simple and affordable way to stay in touch with friends and family back home while travelling overseas ’			1

' it was great to see three take the initiative when @entity139 launched in august and it is the addition of the @entity7 that now makes this plan really stand out			1
