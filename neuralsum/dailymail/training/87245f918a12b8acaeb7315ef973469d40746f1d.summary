by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 19:33 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 04:48 est , 7 january 2014 @entity4 will fail to cut net migration to below 100,000 by the next election , @entity3 has declared			1
the @entity8 business secretary said the target was ‘ impractical ’ and the prime minister ‘ almost certainly wo n’t achieve ’ it by 2015			1
his intervention could spark a new round of @entity15 bloodletting – and comes only weeks after he accused mr @entity4 of behaving like @entity16			1
warning : business secretary @entity3 ( left ) has declared that @entity4 ( right ) will fail to cut net migration to below 100,000 by the next election			1
he deemed the target ' impractical ' and ' unachievable ' by 2015 @entity19 : mr @entity3 made his remarks in a @entity22 documentary about immigration , to be aired tonight			1
the programme features a poll showing that more than three - quarters of the public want migrant numbers reduced however , it also risked backfiring by exposing how out of touch the @entity8 are with public opinion on the issue			2
mr @entity3 made his comments in the documentary @entity34 , to be aired tonight on @entity22			1
the programme released a poll showing that more than three - quarters of the public want migrant numbers reduced , and more than half want them to be cut ‘ a lot ’			1
it would be better for @entity43 to be poorer but with fewer immigrants , @entity44 claimed today			2
the @entity43 @entity47 leader said he said he would ‘ rather we were n’t slightly richer ’ if it means allowing more people into the country to work and create jobs			2
but he also revealed his party does not have an official policy on immigration , although he spent ‘ many hours ’ yesterday discussing it			2
he told @entity57 ’s today programme : ‘ the fact is that if people come to this country from @entity63 and they ’re earning minimum wage , they ’re getting tax credits , possibly child tax credits , child benefit , housing benefit , and this so far has been the undiscussed part of this			0
so i question the economics			0
‘ but if you said to me : “ would you want to see over the next ten years a further 5million people come into @entity43 and if that happened we ’d all be slightly richer ? ” i would say : actually , do you know what i ’d rather we were n’t slightly richer			0
‘ i ’d rather we had communities that felt more united and i ’d rather have a situation where young unemployed @entity43 people had a realistic chance of getting a job			0
‘ so yes , i do think the social side of this matters more than pure market economics			0
’ mr @entity3 said it was ‘ not sensible to have an arbitrary cap ’ on net migration – because many elements which make up the target can not be controlled			1
he said : ‘ so it involves @entity43 people emigrating – you ca n’t control that			0
it involves free movement within the @entity96 – in and out			0
‘ it involves @entity43 people coming back from overseas			0
‘ so setting an arbitrary cap is not helpful , it almost certainly wo n’t achieve the below 100,000 level the @entity101 have set , so let ’s be practical about it			2
’ ‘ the idea it should come down to 100,000 is something the @entity8 have never signed up to because we simply regard it as impractical			1
’ net migration – the difference between the numbers arriving and leaving @entity43 – was below 100,000 during much of the 1990s before increasing sharply in 1998 under @entity111			1
from 2004 it was consistently above 200,000 and reached a peak of more than 250,000 in 2010			0
after @entity115 entered the @entity116 it fell to 153,000 by 2012 but rose to 182,000 in the 12 months to june last year , driven by arrivals from southern @entity63			0
the @entity118 pledged to reduce the total to under 100,000 by the time of the next election , but the @entity8 never signed up to the policy			1
mr @entity3 recently claimed the @entity118 were spreading ‘ panic ’ about immigration			1
last night a @entity101 source said : ‘ the public want the government to control immigration			0
if the @entity8 do n’t want to listen to the public , then they ought to drop the democrats part of their name			0
’ the @entity134 survey found 56 per cent believe immigration should be reduced ‘ a lot ’ , and 21 per cent ‘ a little ’			0
just 17 per cent want migrant numbers to stay the same , and 4 cent want them increased			0
in the programme , former home and foreign secretary @entity140 admits predictions of how many would come after 2004 , when restrictions were dropped for certain @entity96 countries , were ‘ completely catastrophic			0
they were wrong by a factor of ten ’ after controls were dropped , he said , immigration became ‘ bluntly a nightmare ’			0
but @entity151 , @entity111 home secretary between 2001 to 2004 , said : ‘ i ’m unapologetic because if you do n’t have legal managed migration and people do n’t sign up so they pay national insurance and tax , they ’ll work illegally			2
’ comparison : mr @entity3 's intervention comes weeks after he compared mr @entity4 with @entity16 ( above ) opposing : in the programme , @entity140 ( left ) admits predictions of how many people would come after 2004 were ' catastrophic ' , but @entity151 , home secretary between 2001 and 2004 , said he was ' unapologetic ' mrs may told the programme : ‘ i do n’t think people have looked at [ immigration ] sufficiently closely to be able to recognise the impact it has on members of the public			1
’ @entity172 , @entity111 ’s shadow immigration minister , said : ' @entity3 is right to say that the prime minister 's net migration measure is actually rising and not falling to the tens of thousands as he promised			1
' he could also point out that the @entity116 's obsession with the net migration target ignores illegal immigration and is actually pushing migration into less controlled routes			1
this gap between the government 's rhetoric and reality on immigration is continuing to undermine public confidence			2

@entity3 *dubbed* @entity4 's target to cut migration ' impractical '
@entity4 aims to slash net migration to below 100,000 by next election
comes just weeks after @entity3 compared prime minister to @entity16
