they were punched and kicked in the heads , leaving them needing instant medical attention			1
ironically , the officers were from the department 's @entity28 and were only present at the protest to ensure that demonstrators ' civil rights were respected by police			1
the video shows the women and one of the men were the first to attack lt @entity54 and lt @entity55 , the @entity50 reports			1
male number 3 and male number 4 get involved later , kicking the officers and pulling them to the ground			1
male number 4 ends the attack by punching @entity61 , whose nose was broken in the assault			1
lt @entity54 was left with cuts and bruises			0

@entity8 , who referred to the suspects as ' agitators and anarchists ' , added : ' their world is a very different world often times than the world the rest of us live in			0
they do n't like government , they do n't society , they do n't like anything			0
' so they 're seeking to take advantage of it			0
' his tone is in stark contrast to that of @entity1 's mayor , @entity99 , who was branded a ' total nicompoop ' after he used the word ' allegedly ' to describe a mob assault by protesters on two police lieutenants			1
demonstrators marched over the @entity7 on saturday during the @entity107 rally and march it is thought 25,000 to 30,000 people joined the rally , which left two officers needing medical attention it was just one of many similar protests across the country thousands of demonstrators marched in @entity118 , @entity1 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 on saturday to protest against killings of unarmed black men by police officers			1

officers in @entity121 , @entity138 said they detained about 45 people for vandalism , failure to disperse , resisting arrest and other charges after thousands took to the streets			1
decisions by grand juries to return no indictments against the officers involved in the deaths of @entity151 in @entity152 and @entity16 in @entity1 have put police treatment of minorities back on the national agenda			2

@entity186 has also released images of a number of witnesses to the assault who they hope will be able to secure a conviction			1
it is thought a number of the witnesses were using mobile phones to record the attack , while a man wearing a bright green baseball cap is believed to have been at the march as a legal observer for the @entity208			2
this incident the latest controversy in a long - running stand off between @entity1 and police following a spate of deaths in custody			2
they include the death of @entity16 , a 43 - year - old black man who died when officer @entity217 attempted to subdue him in @entity218 , @entity219 , on july 17 , with ' chokehold ' restraining technique that is banned under @entity186 protocol			1
