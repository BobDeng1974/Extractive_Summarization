we may not be able to hear it , but the @entity2 is constantly oscillating and creating a hum that has been likened to the ring of a bell			1
it 's long been known that earthquakes and their seismic activity contribute to this ringing , but researchers have now proved ocean waves also play a role			1
as so - called short waves collide near the surface they create weak microseismic waves , which combine with long , more powerful waves dragging across the ocean 's floor to create the constant hum. it 's long been known that earthquakes contribute to making the @entity2 ring like a bell , but researchers have now proved ocean waves also play a role			1
as short waves collide near the surface they create weak microseismic waves , which combine with long waves on the ocean 's floor to create a constant hum earthquakes shake the planet in such a way that the @entity2 can oscillate for months after the seismic event			1
this oscillation is caused by vibrations and researchers in the mid- 1980s found the hum can drop as low as an e flat , 20 octaves below middle c on the musical scale			0
in the late 1990s , however , seismologists found that the planet does n't just oscillate following quakes , and instead is vibrating at extremely low frequencies all of the time			0
these vibrations are n't powerful enough to be detected by humans , but are strong enough to register on seismometers and similar			0

in the late 1990s , seismologists found that the planet does n't just oscillate following quakes , and instead is vibrating at extremely low frequencies all of the time			0
a team of @entity65 and @entity66 seismologists first suggested ocean waves may cause this hum in 2004			1
using data from 2008 , a @entity70 team found that ocean waves colliding generate seismic activity , but these waves only take 13 seconds or less to complete a single oscillation			1
they did n't explain why slow seismic waves - which provide the most powerful bell - like ringing - can last for longer than 50 seconds			2
so the team studied the movement of ocean waves at the bottom of the seabed			2
as these long waves travel over the ocean floor they meet resistance , especially as they pass over the steep continental shelves , and this friction helps create long seismic waves , that oscillate much slower			1
a team of @entity65 and @entity66 seismologists first suggested ocean waves may cause this constant hum in 2004			2
they proposed that as ocean waves move in opposite directions and collide they create microseismic activity			2
but @entity100 , a senior research scientist at @entity102 in @entity70 , and his team wanted to put this theory to the test			0
they began by studying and measuring seismic activity across the globe , including earthquakes , storms and the movement of ocean waves , throughout 2008			1
during this time , two seismic events with magnitudes of 6.9 and 7.1 , took place on 3 march and 20 march			0
but the largest hum coincided with the strongest seismic waves during the @entity117 on 10 and 11 march			2
that storm generated waves with a peak period of 16 seconds that reached heights of up to 42ft ( 12.8 metres )			0
during this storm , a spectrogram found energy levels reached 10 @entity125 , and lasted 36 hours			0
by looking at how much energy was generated by the storm , the researchers were able to conclude that the hum was caused by the storm , and was n't the remnants of seismic activity from the events			0
they could then look at the reasons why			0
' ocean waves provide most of the energy that feeds the continuous vertical oscillations of the solid @entity2 , ' said the researchers			1
during march 2008 two large seismic events took place			0
but the largest hum coincided with a @entity117 ( right )			0
the storm generated waves with a peak of 16 seconds and heights of 42ft ( 12.8 metres ) ( left )			0
from this , the team could conclude the hum was caused by the storm , and not leftover from the seismic events using seismic readings from 2008 , a @entity70 team spotted that ocean waves colliding generate seismic activity , but these waves only take 13 seconds to complete a single oscillation			1
they did n't explain why slow seismic waves - which provide the most powerful bell - like ringing - can last for longer than 50 seconds ' the hum contains periods longer than 30 seconds , and the primary and secondary peaks are centered around 15 and five seconds respectively			2
' motions in all three bands are recorded everywhere on the planet and the team said they can provide information on both the solid @entity2 structure , the ocean wave climate over the past century , and the properties of short period ocean waves			1
' yet , the use of seismic data is limited because where and how ocean waves rock the @entity2 is not known , in particular for the hum , ' continued the team			1
' the hum is the least understood part of @entity2 's oscillations			1
' using the 2008 data , mr @entity100 and his team spotted that ocean waves colliding generate seismic activity , but these waves only take 13 seconds or less to complete a single oscillation			2
the team then studied ocean waves at the bottom of the seabed			2
as these so - called long waves travel over the ocean floor ( stock image ) and continental shelves they create seismic waves that oscillate much slower			1
this means that earthquakes , colliding oceans and long waves all combine to create the @entity2 's hum they did n't explain why slow seismic waves - which provide the most powerful bell - like ringing - can last for longer than 50 seconds			1
so the team studied the movement of ocean waves at the bottom of the seabed			0
these waves are known as long because they travel from the floor to the coast and back again			0
as these long waves travel over the ocean floor they meet resistance , especially as they pass over the steep continental shelves , and this helps create long seismic waves that oscillate much slower			1
this means that all three theories - earthquakes , colliding oceans and long waves - combine to create the @entity2 's hum. although the majority comes from the latter			1
the findings are published in @entity226 , a journal of the @entity228 ( @entity228 )			0
mr @entity100 said that by measuring and understanding long , microseismic waves , researchers can learn more about how the @entity2 is structured			1
' now we know where this ringing comes from and the next question is : what can we do with it , ' he told the @entity228 .			0

it has long been known that @entity2 is constantly oscillating and ' humming '
earthquakes cause a certain level of hum , but a study claims different sized ocean waves also contribute to @entity2 's oscillations
as water collides , it creates weak microseismic waves that cause a hum
stronger seismic waves then occurs when water travels along the floor
