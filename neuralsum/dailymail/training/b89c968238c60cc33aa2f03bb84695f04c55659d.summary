by @entity0 published : 09:43 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 04:24 est , 12 september 2013 when it opened its timber doors three years ago , this £ 7million ‘ eco primary school ’ was applauded for its environmentally friendly credentials			1
it was heated by solar power and its plumbing system relied on rain collected from the roof , which was made of locally grown sweet chestnut			2
sadly , the zero - carbon building is not quite as sustainable as the designers had hoped			2
' one of the greenest schools in @entity14 ' : @entity16 's eco-building , near @entity17 in @entity18 , needs ' significant ' repairs just three years after opening because it has been leaking water in fact , thanks to a series of water leaks and mouldy walls , pupils are now being taught in tents erected in the school grounds			1
the local authority in @entity18 has already spent £ 250,000 to investigate the problem , and plans to sue the architects			1
without urgent repairs , it says teaching pupils inside the building could seriously damage their health			1
@entity16 , near @entity17 , used to house students in a @entity40 building but it reopened in 2010 as one of the first zero - carbon schools in the country			1
the new site was praised for being ‘ stunning ’ and ‘ extremely environmentally friendly ’			2
its design featured four buildings made from ‘ sustainable ’ timber , with solar panels providing electricity and heat			2
the roof was supposedly weather - proofed with strips of sweet chestnut grown nearby and angled so rainwater could be collected and used to flush the toilets			2
but apparent faults in the structure mean the roof and walls have become sodden , buckling over time and leaving gaping holes for rain to leak inside			2
costly : the school 's 320 pupils will be taught in temporary buildings which will be set up in the playing fields @entity68 , whose son attends the school , said : ‘ there ’s been leaking there ever since it opened			1
last year we could see the roof was starting to warp			0
’ she added : i went to a parents ’ lunch and you could see these large patches of mould			0
my ex-partner is a builder and he could n’t understand how it could get that bad			0
’ children are now being taught in five large marquees in the grounds , with repairs to the main buildings predicted to take up to two years			1
miss @entity68 , a childminder , said she only found out about the tents when she took her son to school for the beginning of term this week			1
‘ i drove past on sunday and saw several marquees			0
i thought there must have been some sort of event on			0
the next morning i arrived to find classes had moved , some of them into marquees and some of them into the library and the art room			0
' the children are too young to know what ’s happening			0
they think it ’s all very exciting			0
’ legal case : @entity110 said it might sue the architects of the £ 7m @entity16 when the eco school opened three years ago , headteacher @entity112 said : ‘ it is a stunning design			1
i believe it will be a flagship school which will be extremely environmentally friendly			0
’ she declined to comment yesterday			0
a report for @entity110 found it has already paid £ 250,000 merely to investigate the cause of the leaks and start initial repairs			1
a spokesman said : ‘ temporary accommodation has been installed and all classes went ahead when children returned to school			0
we are currently taking legal advice			0
’ @entity126 , of @entity127 , said they were working with the council to solve the problems .			1

@entity16 's new £ 7million eco-building opened in 2010
but @entity110 says it began leaking *shortly* after opening
*lessons* are in tents on the playing fields while repairs are carried out
local authority may now sue architectural firm @entity126 over the fault
