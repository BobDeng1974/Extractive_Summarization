by @entity0 when @entity1 was taken to hospital after serving in @entity3 the only thing keeping the @entity6 soldier strong was knowing his military dog @entity8 was waiting for him			1
but just as the @entity11 mp finished his treatment for injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder , the @entity9 called his wife , @entity15 , to say the dog had been moved			2
what followed was an extraordinary effort over three years , involving the @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 to reunite @entity1 with the dog that meant so much to him			1
for @entity1 , it was the moment he had been waiting for since he was medically retired in 2011			1
' they gave me my life back , ' he told the @entity35			0
not being able to see his dog , who had accompanied him on dangerous missions since 2009 , was hard for @entity1			1
' we had no idea he would never see her again			0
they never let him say goodbye			0
... i lost the man that my husband was , ' his wife said			2
she explained that when he returned from his last tour in @entity3 he was ' banged up quite a bit ' and only agreed to treatment because he believed it meant he would get to work with his dog again			2
but the day before he was due to leave hospital , mrs @entity51 received a phone call asking her to break the news to her husband that he would n't see @entity8 again			2
' to have to sit there and look my husband in the eye and say " i do n’t know how to tell you this , but she ’s gone " , ’ it was like telling him that our child just died , ' she told @entity63			0
refusing to give up on @entity8 , the couple began a complicated journey to find the dog and adopt her			0
@entity67 : @entity1 had worked with @entity8 the dog since 2009 , and quickly became devoted to her mission : @entity15 and @entity1 spent three years tracking down @entity8 so they could adopt her the search took them from the @entity74 base in @entity75 to the @entity76 in @entity77 , before finally finding that @entity8 had been sent to a base in @entity79 , @entity28			1
the couple contacted friends stationed in @entity28 , who were able to confirm @entity8 was there by checking a tattoo in her ear			2
@entity1 thought his dream of seeing @entity8 had finally been realized , but despite a program to let soldiers wounded in combat adopt their service dogs , the @entity19 declined his request			1
refusing to give up , the couple enlisted the help of @entity6 representative @entity93 , who sent letters to the @entity19 insisting @entity8 be retired			0
on february 20 , @entity1 finally got the call he had been waiting for , when a member of the @entity19 stationed in @entity97 told him : ' she 's yours			1
' @entity8 was flown to the @entity99 and the pair had an emotional reunion in a hotel , where the dog charged into @entity1 's arms as soon as she saw him			1
focus : @entity1 , pictured with @entity15 and @entity8 , was separated from his dog when he was treated for ptsd ' it was kinda like seeing someone come back from the dead , ' he told @entity110			1
his wife said seeing @entity8 had an immediate affect on her husband , adding : ' i watched his eyes change back ... they gave a soldier his life back			0
' the couple took @entity8 to meet @entity119 this week , and to thank her for her help			0
she said : ' @entity51 and @entity8 served our country valiantly in @entity3 , and @entity51 has paid a dear price for that service , returning home with @entity107			0
' @entity126 with his best friend and prior service dog @entity8 was the right thing to do and i 'm so glad that our office was a part of this happy reunion			0
