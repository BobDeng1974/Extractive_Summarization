@entity0 is the name on many @entity4 fans ' lips after the young full back scored twice in @entity7 's first game in charge of the club			1
the 7 - 0 friendly win over @entity12 saw a new 3 - 4 - 3 formation work a treat , @entity10 put in a sparkling performance in midfield and @entity18 return to goalscoring form , but @entity0 stole the show with two second half goals from left wing back			1
he has represented the club 's youth teams but has never played alongside so many of @entity4 's leading lights			2
a player is not necessarily considered ' young ' at 20 these days , why has it taken him so long to break through ? firstly , the depth of @entity4 's reserve and youth set - ups must be noted			0
there are some very good footballers who struggle to get a game for their second string			0
secondly , @entity0 only joined at @entity55 level - relatively late to sign for a professional academy			0
inexperienced : @entity0 has only made two senior professional appearances - both for @entity59 where was he before then ? @entity0 played at @entity61 and @entity63 's academies before moving to @entity4			2
his older brother @entity65 , now at @entity64 , was already at @entity4 's academy when @entity0 signed up			1
what professional experience does @entity0 have ? frankly , not much - especially given the fact @entity0 is 21 in november			0
a loan spell at @entity59 at the start of the last season was cut short by injury after just two appearances			0
enough of the background , what sort of a player is he ? @entity0 is an attacking left back , small in stature , but blessed with pace			0
he is comfortable receiving the ball in the final third , as he showed with two neat finishes in @entity82 on thursday			0
oh , brother : @entity64 's @entity84 ( left ) celebrates their championship title win in may in good company : @entity0 has been training with the first - team squad since @entity26 took over video new signings keen to impress @entity26 in the headlines : @entity0 is mobbed after scoring one of his two goals on thursday what made @entity26 plump for him ? the @entity93 has stated his intent to play 3 - 4 - 3 with wing backs			1
summer signing @entity96 will be the starting left wing back but with @entity99 and @entity100 having recently left , and with @entity102 departing in january , it 's an area where the @entity4 boss has few options			1
what are the chances of him staying in the first - team ? @entity0 knows he has very little chance of displacing @entity96 in @entity4 's first - team - even though he is 20 months his senior - but if he keeps up the good work he could be a squad member as back - up to the £ 31.5million man			1
@entity4 have been linked with @entity114 's @entity113 but @entity26 will be reluctant to over-spend on a bench - warmer and has declared his intention to promote youth			2
@entity96 thing : @entity0 has very little chance of replacing @entity4 's £ 34million man			2

@entity0 scored twice for @entity4 vs @entity12
@entity0 , 20 , played as a left wing back by @entity7
@entity26 needs cover for @entity96 at left wing back
