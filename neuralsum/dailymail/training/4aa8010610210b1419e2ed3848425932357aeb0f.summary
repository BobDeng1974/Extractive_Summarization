that gesture was followed by seven first - class passengers who jumped out of their seats for the other @entity2 so they could sit together			1
it meant the @entity2 could enjoy leather seats , more legroom and state - of - the - art headphones			1
‘ it was incredibly touching , ’ captain @entity53 said in a telephone interview from @entity76 in @entity77			0
‘ @entity5 is a very complex and ambiguous war ... and a difficult thing to keep track of so it is amazing when we are 10 years ( into ) a war and there is still that kind of community , that level of support , the level of willingness to go out of one 's way			0
’ @entity94 , director of the @entity95 at @entity13 's @entity12 with @entity3 marine major @entity54 , left luxury : the passengers gave up their seats in first class so the @entity2 could fly in comfort the welcome home started with a phone call			1

he told @entity119 he 'd try to do something in the hour or so before the flight landed			0
but he cautioned that while volunteers make an effort to welcome military personnel whenever they come through the airport , he was n't sure he could pull anything off in such a short time			0
@entity118 got on the phone with the police and fire departments , the airlines and anyone else he could think of			0
marine capt. @entity53 after his arrival at @entity134 ‘ there must have been 15 @entity13 firemen and an equal number of @entity13 police and they formed a corridor for the @entity2 when they got off the airplane , ’ he said			2
@entity53 said the @entity2 did n't know what to make of it , starting with the slightly unnerving experience of looking out a plane window to see a fire truck			1
‘ for a second , we were like , " are we in trouble ? " ' he said			0
saluting soldiers : @entity56 has a policy of upgrading uniformed military personnel after they realized the reception was for them , the @entity2 soaked in the scene , even as they said police officers hustled them off to another gate so they 'd make their flight to @entity60			1
‘ they were just so thankful - very , very appreciative , ’ said @entity156 , an @entity56 employee who helps military personnel flying in and out of @entity12			2
