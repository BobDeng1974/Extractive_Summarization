information obtained using torture was used to help foil an @entity4 plot to bring down two planes , it has been claimed			1
@entity7 authorities intercepted a bomb at @entity9 after being ' tipped off ' by @entity11 security forces , reportedly following the interrogation by torture of an @entity4 operative			1
the claim comes as former @entity17 head sir @entity16 said torture does produce ' useful information ' and can be ' effective in the short term			1
' intelligence obtained via torture was reportedly used in a ' @entity24 real - time operation ' to foil an @entity4 plot to bring down two planes and intercept a bomb at @entity9 ( pictured ) a major security alert was launched after plastic explosives concealed inside inkjet printer cartridges were discovered on two cargo planes travelling from @entity31 to the @entity32 in october 2010			1
pictured is the package found at @entity9 a major security alert was launched after plastic explosives concealed inside inkjet printer cartridges were discovered on two cargo planes travelling from @entity31 to the @entity32 in october 2010			1
it is believed the bombs were designed to go off mid-air and bring the huge planes down over the @entity32			1
after what was described as a ' tip - off ' from @entity11 security forces , the planes were stopped at @entity9 in @entity46 and the @entity47 and the bombs uncovered			1
a group called @entity50 ( @entity50 ) later took responsibility for the plot			0
now it has been claimed the discovery at @entity9 was only possible because @entity7 officials in @entity11 were in communication with a team believed to have been using torture on a member of terror group @entity4			1
' the people in @entity61 went back on the phone two or three times to where the interrogation was taking place in @entity67 to find out specifically where the bomb was hidden			2
there were two @entity7 there , in immediate communication with where the interrogation was taking place , and as soon as it happened , they were in touch with the @entity7			2
it was all done in real time , ' an intelligence source told @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 at @entity84			0
a major security alert was launched after plastic explosives concealed inside inkjet printer cartridges were discovered on two cargo planes travelling from @entity31 to the @entity32 in october 2010			1
pictured is a packaged being launched onto a police helicopter at @entity9 it is claimed the discovery at @entity9 was only possible because @entity7 officials in @entity11 were in communication with a team believed to have been using torture on a member of @entity4 a source close to the operation said there was ' no way ' that the information which led to the plot being exposed ' was n’t procured under duress ' , but that the @entity7 officials would have ensured they were not present			1
he added : ' of course we use intelligence from torture			2
we take it from wherever we can get it , but we are never , ever going to say " we do n’t want that "			0
or ask too many questions about where it has come from			0
it is the difference between intelligence and evidence			0
' last month , following the death of @entity117 , prime minister @entity118 defended @entity7 's ties with @entity11 - despite the country ’s record on human rights			1
he also said that a piece of counter-terrorism intelligence supplied by the @entity127 state had ' saved potentially hundreds of lives ' in the @entity7 , which aides have confirmed was a reference to the bomb plot			1
he added : ' now , you can be prime minister and say exactly what you think about every regime in the world and make great headlines , and give great speeches			0
former @entity17 head sir @entity16 said yesterday that torture does produce ' useful information ' and can be ' effective in the short term ' ' but i think my first job is to try and keep this country safe from terrorism and if that means you have to build strong relationships sometimes with regimes you do n't always agree with , that i think is part of the job and that is the way i do it			2
and that is the best way i can explain it			0
' former spy chief sir @entity16 , who was head of @entity157 from 2009 to 2014 , yesterday hit back at claims that security services played a role in the radicalisation of @entity7 jihadist @entity162			2
@entity163 , research director of @entity164 , claims @entity162 , who was nicknamed @entity16 , was interrogated by @entity17 and subjected to security agency harassment before becoming a militant			0
but sir @entity16 said arguments that harassment drove @entity162 to join @entity169 were ' very specious '			0
' the idea that somehow being spoken to by a member of @entity17 is a radicalising act , i think this is very false and very transparent , ' he told @entity175 's today programme			0
sir @entity16 also told presenter @entity177 : ' torture had been used for “ thousands of years in order to extract useful information			2
' if you decide in 2015 that it does n't work at all then that would be to misunderstand the problem			0
' he added : ' the whole problem about torture and maltreatment is sadly is that it does produce intelligence			2
and that ’s why in a civilised society like ours we have to set aside certain methods , even though they might be effective in the short term			0
in the longer term they are very counterproductive ; they are undermining the values of our society			0
