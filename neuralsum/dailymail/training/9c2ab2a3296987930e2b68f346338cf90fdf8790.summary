by @entity0 a five - month - old boy has grown a five - inch tail			1
@entity3 was born with spina bifida , a rare spinal defect which leaves a gap in the spine			1
within days , his mother noticed a prominent tail beginning to form , which is still steadily increasing in size			0
@entity3 is awaiting surgery in @entity14 , @entity15 , to remove his five - inch tail caused by a spinal defect distraught , she has implored surgeons in @entity14 , @entity15 , to remove the growth but so far it has been deemed not possible			1
the growth will have started within @entity3 's first month in the womb			0
in the first four weeks , developing babies grow a structure called the neural tube			0
it is this that will eventually form the spine and nervous system			2
in cases of spina bifida , the spinal column - the bone that surrounds and protects the nerves - does not fully close			1
the growth is a symptom of spina bifida , where the end of the spine does not fully close the exact causes are unknown , but several risk factors have been identified , the most significant being a lack of folic acid before and at the very start of pregnancy			2
it affects one pregnancy in every 1,000 in @entity47			0
in most cases surgery can be done to close the defect			0
however , damage to the nervous system will usually already have taken place , resulting in a range of symptoms , including paralysis and incontinence .			2
