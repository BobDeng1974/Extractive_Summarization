woman feeds tiny scrap of leftover pasty to a nearby pigeon			2
woman puts packet in the bin			2
so far , so ordinary			0
well , at least it was – right up until the woman was issued with a £ 75 fine for littering			1
she had the misfortune to catch the eye of a plain - clothes ‘ education and enforcement ’ worker from the local council , who promptly gave her a fixed penalty notice because she fed the bird			1
the lunchtime encounter happened in @entity5 city centre and was witnessed by @entity35 , an @entity36 worker			1
he said : ‘ i was really annoyed by what happened			0
i could not believe it			0
she was putting rubbish in the bin and then just gave a bit of her pasty to the birds			0
‘ a man came over and told her what she was doing was against some @entity46 and gave her a fine			2
’ @entity5 council said even though the woman had binned the wrapper correctly , her actions constituted littering because pigeons are ‘ vermin ’ and should not be fed. but it has since decided that the woman ’s pasty will not turn into a very expensive lunchtime treat after all			1
the council received a complaint over the incident and has backed down over the fine			1
‘ it is not our intention to target individuals unnecessarily and issue fines where education is more appropriate , ’ a spokesman said			0
‘ feeding pigeons in the town centre is discouraged as the birds are vermin and seen as a nuisance to many			1
’ he added : ‘ we will be writing to the individual with the intention of cancelling the fixed penalty notice , but would like to remind the public dropping litter is an offence and we would advise people not to encourage pigeons by feeding them			2
’ the council said the fine was issued by a member of its plain - clothed education and enforcement team , whose other roles include tackling fly - tipping			1
it stressed that feeding pigeons would still be deemed a littering offence in future			1
local shop worker @entity92 , 51 , supported the council ’s position			0
he said : ‘ if people are fined for dropping a cigarette end they should be fined for dropping any sort of litter			0
’ it ’s not the first time a few crumbs have proved potentially costly			0
in 2008 , @entity103 was issued with a £ 75 fine for dropping a piece of sausage roll while feeding it to her four - year - old daughter @entity107 , but a judge in @entity109 threw the case out			0
the following year , @entity111 , 26 , was fined £ 75 for allowing her 17 - month - old son @entity112 to feed bread to ducks in @entity115 , @entity116 .			0

@entity5 council said the woman 's actions constituted littering because pigeons are ' vermin ' and should not be fed
but it has nevertheless since decided to *rescind* the fine
