president @entity52 , pictured left , at the @entity53 in an audience with pope @entity11 , right , on july 3 , 1963 during his pontificate from 1963 to 1978 , @entity8 made landmark progress in improving @entity58 ' relationship with other @entity59			1
but he disappointed many @entity58 who were hoping for liberalisation of church teaching on sexuality			0
after much consultation and , reportedly , personal anguish , @entity11 enshrined the church 's teaching against artificial contraception in the 1968 encyclical ' @entity68 ' ( ' of human life ' )			2

@entity30 opened the way for @entity90 to be said in local languages instead of in @entity92			0
its reforms also inspired many nuns , especially in the @entity95 , shed their long robes in favor of knee - length skirts and abandoned the head - coverings that were their orders ' dress code for centuries			0
@entity8 , who like @entity8 took up traveling to distant lands , ended nearly a millennium of estrangement between @entity58 and @entity106 @entity59 when he journeyed to @entity107 in 1964 and embraced patriarch @entity108 , then the @entity106 leader			2
