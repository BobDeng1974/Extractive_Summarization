the @entity12 has been seeking to make them public in the name of holding government accountable			1
the fight over the photographs reaches back to the early years of the wars in @entity5 and @entity6 , and it invokes the images of abuse at the @entity20 in @entity5 that sparked international outrage after they emerged in 2004 and 2006			1
this image shows an unidentified detainee standing on a box with a bag on his head and wires attached to him at the @entity20 in @entity29			1
a federal judge has ordered that more pictures of inmate abuse must be shared by the @entity2 military ' to allow the government to suppress any image that might provoke someone , somewhere , to violence would be to give the government sweeping power to suppress evidence of its own agents ' misconduct , ' said @entity42 , @entity12 deputy legal director			2
' giving the government that kind of censorial power would have implications far beyond this specific context			2
' the @entity49 is studying the ruling and will make any further responses in court , spokesman lt. col. @entity48 said			2
early in the 2004 lawsuit , the @entity12 pointed to the @entity20 photos as priority examples of records the organization was seeking on the treatment of detainees			0
it 's unclear how many more photographs may exist			0
the government has said it has 29 relevant pictures from at least seven different sites in @entity6 and @entity5 , and it 's believed to have perhaps hundreds or thousands more , @entity8 said in a ruling in august			1
he said some photos he had seen ' are relatively innocuous while others need more serious consideration , ' and he has ruled that any images that would be released would be redacted to protect the identities of people in them			0
some photographs , taken by service members in @entity5 and @entity6 , were part of criminal investigations of alleged abuse			0

indeed , ' the danger associated with release of these photographs is heightened now , ' amid the rise of the @entity116 militant group , navy rear adm. @entity117 , the vice director for operations for the @entity119 , said in a december court filing			0
@entity116 , he said ' would use these photographs to further encourage its supporters and followers to attack @entity2 military and government personnel			0
' amid the lawsuit , @entity93 passed a 2009 law allowing the government to keep the photos secret if the secretary of defense certified that unveiling them would endanger @entity2 citizens or government or military personnel			0
defense secretaries have since done so , but @entity8 said the government has n't been specific enough .			0
