it may look like a model - makers dream , but this collection of components will travel at more than 1,000 mph when put together			2
this is how the @entity5 when broken down into its 3,500 components			2
it includes a state of the art @entity10 jet engine that is normally used in a @entity11 , @entity13 hybrid rockets and its titanium skinned chassis			1
it needs a 550bhp @entity31 v8 engine to pump the fuel into the rocket			2
the team behind the @entity35 also revealed how they intend to slow it from 1,000mph ( 1,600km/h ) to zero			1
after the car reaches its top speed , air brakes and parachutes slow it to 160mph ( 260km/h )			2
breaking to this speed is done at a constant @entity43 - equivalent to going from 60mph ( 95km/h ) in a normal car to zero in just one second - for 20 seconds			2
at this speed the cars wheels are still spinning 10,000 times per minute			0
attempts to use carbon rotors from a jet fighter in the form of car - like disc brakes shattered at speeds of just half this , so the team needed a new approach			1
instead , they switched to steel rotors			0
in tests , these could withstand temperatures of up to 850 ° c ( 1,560 ° f ) , and be used again			0
the next step will be to test these brakes out at the full 10,000rpm that will be experienced			0
the carbon fibre and titanium chassis and canopy will be fitted together using 22,500 aerospace grade rivets , which are fixed by hand by the teams engineers			1
however , at £ 10 million the rocket - powered vehicle is probably a little out the price range of most model car enthusiasts			2
in 2016 driver @entity76 fighter pilot @entity75 will travel with the vehicle to the desert of the @entity79 in north west @entity80 where they will attempt to break the 1,000mph ( 1,600km/h ) barrier			1
wing commander @entity75 currently holds the land speed record of 763mph ( 1,223km/h ) in the @entity85			2
a spokesman for the @entity5 project said they were confident of breaking this record and going faster than 1,000mph for the first time on land			1
the project has been seven years in the making and has been a dream of former @entity76 pilot @entity75 since he set the current record in 1997			2
the spokesman said : ' the @entity5 kit contains over 3,500 components , many custom - made			0
' one hundred and ten man - years have been invested in the design , build and manufacture of the @entity35 which is on track to challenge the @entity101 later this year in the @entity102 , @entity80			1
' during the record - chasing run in @entity80 , @entity5 ( pictured ) will cover 12 miles ( 19km ) in two minutes , exerting an acceleration force of almost @entity105 , and peak deceleration force of @entity43 on the driver earlier this month the bloodhound team 's rocket partner @entity13 carried out tests on the first of three large hybrid rocket motors that will be included in the vehicle			1
initially @entity5 will use one @entity13 hybrid rocket in high speed testing scheduled for 2015 and a cluster of three rockets in its 1,000mph campaign in 2016			1
this is addition to main the main engine , which is normally found powering a @entity11 , weighs a tonne and produces 20,000lbs ( @entity122 ) - or nine tonnes of thrust			1
the two power plants together produce 135,000 thrust horse power , or the equivalent to 180 @entity28 cars			0
earlier this year , designers of the supersonic car revealed the vehicle ’s futuristic cockpit			0
it has been made from five different types of carbon fibre weave , and two different resins			0
it has taken more than 10,000 hours to design and manufacture in total			0
sandwiched between the layers of carbon fibre are three different thicknesses of aluminium honeycomb core , which provide additional strength			0
at its thickest point the material is made up of 13 layers , but measures just 0.9 - inches ( 24mm ) thick			0
@entity5 will have to withstand extreme forces , including the risk of bird strike , during its record attempt the components for @entity5 include solid aluminium wheels for running over the desert surface ( 6 ) , a @entity154 printed titanium steering wheel ( 18 ) , the cockpit canopy ( 29 ) , ice tanks ( 33 ) for cooling the @entity158 ( 15 ) carbon fibre fuel tanks ( 27 ) , the @entity10 jet engine ( 14 ) and driver @entity75 ( 17 ) the cockpit structure weighs 441lbs ( 200kg ) and bolts directly to the metallic rear chassis carrying the jet , rocket and racing car engine			1
it has to be strong as this front section will have to endure peak aerodynamic loads of up to three tonnes per square metre at 1,000mph ( 1,609kph ) , as well the considerable forces generated by the front wheels and suspension			1
it will also carry ballistic armour to protect wing commander @entity75 should a stone be thrown up by the front wheels at very high speeds			0
@entity5 will attempt to beat the @entity101 set by the @entity179 in 1997 the cockpit is positioned in front of three loud motors - the jet , a cluster of hybrid rockets and the racing car engine that drives the rocket ’s oxidiser pump , which are expected to generate a noise level estimated at 140 decibels - the equivalent to a shotgun blast			1
wing commander @entity75 will wear a specially made in - ear communications system to protect his hearing and to ensure that he can communicate with mission control			0
@entity196 , chief engineer behind @entity5 : ' this is a fantastic moment in the project , it is great to see the car broken down into its main components			1
“ it validates the many years of hard work by our team of motorsport and aerospace engineers			0
” the @entity35 stands for ‘ @entity206 ’			1
the vehicle has four wheels and is powered by both the newly - fitted jet engine and a rocket			1
it is set to travel at 1,000mph ( 1,600km/h )			2
the slender body , 44 feet ( 14 metres ) long , keeps the entire vehicle aerodynamic			0
the pencil - shaped car ( concept pictured ) will be 44ft ( 13.4m ) long and weigh 7.5 tonnes when completed it weighs just over seven tonnes and the engines will produce more than 135,000 horsepower			1
that ’s more than six times the power of all the cars on a formula 1 starting grid put together			0
in the coming years the vehicle will begin test runs at lower speeds before attempting to set a new land speed record			0
the current land speed record stands at 763.035mph ( 1,227.985km/h ) , set by former @entity76 pilot @entity75 - who will also drive the bloodhound - back in 1997 in the @entity229 .			0

the @entity35 is designed to faster than 1,000mph ( 1,600km/h )
car will be 44ft ( 13.4m ) long , *6ft* ( 183cm ) in *diameter* and weigh 7.5 tonnes
engineers will use 22,500 *aircraft* rivets to piece the components together
will use three of the hybrid rockets when it makes record attempt in 2016 along with @entity10 jet engine that normally powers a @entity11
the record attempt is *due* to take place in 2016 in the @entity80 desert
