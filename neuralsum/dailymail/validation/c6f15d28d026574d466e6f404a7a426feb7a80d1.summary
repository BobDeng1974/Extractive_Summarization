@entity1 coach @entity0 has claimed @entity2 cares more about @entity3 than @entity4 ahead of his side 's crunch @entity7 qualifier against the @entity8			1
@entity0 's astonishing claim comes on the back of @entity4 's dramatic slump in form and Â£ 85.3million world record signing @entity2 being booed by his own fans at the @entity15			2
the @entity17 champions suffered their fifth defeat of 2015 when they lost 4 - 3 at home to @entity21 side @entity20 on tuesday night , and although that was enough for @entity4 to progress to the quarter - finals of the @entity24 5 - 4 on aggregate , it did not spare the players from the wrath of angry @entity28			1
@entity2 endured a frustrating evening on tuesday night but @entity4 still qualified for the quarter - finals fans waved white handerkerchiefs - the traditional symbol of disgust at a bad performance - with @entity2 once again made the scapegoat for @entity4 's problems			1
@entity2 was branded selfish and castigated in the @entity4 media after choosing to shoot rather than pass to @entity38 and @entity39 against @entity40 in january and the @entity41 has since suffered a dip in form with no goals or assists in his last eight games			0
and now @entity0 has added fuel to the fire by insisting @entity2 is saving his best for @entity3 ' visit to @entity1 on march 28 , when the top two sides in @entity52 meet in @entity53			1
@entity2 celebrates scoring a late winner for @entity3 against @entity55 back in september last year @entity1 coach @entity0 ( right ) believes @entity2 ( left ) cares more for playing for his country than @entity4 ' i feel that @entity2 is saving himself for the national team , ' @entity0 told sports.walla.co.il			1
' the level of the miles he does and the level of his commitment to the national team is nothing like how he plays for @entity4			0
' when they had a player injured [ @entity67 , who revealed he is out for six months after requiring knee ligament surgery ] @entity2 was the first to [ tweet ] ' get well soon '			0
' they are like us , they are one group , but @entity2 is the one that gives them balance			0
' the @entity41 , playing against @entity20 on tuesday , has struggled for form in recent weeks for @entity4 @entity78 scored twice as the @entity24 holders advanced 5 - 4 on aggregate on tuesday @entity1 and @entity3 are the early surprise front - runners in @entity52 , with @entity0 's leaders having won their opening three games against @entity85 , @entity55 and @entity86			1
second - placed @entity3 are a point behind @entity1 and unbeaten after four games , and confidence is high in @entity91 's squad after the goalless draw against group favourites @entity94 in @entity95 in november			2
@entity0 admits that stopping @entity2 is key to @entity1 staying top of the section , but he takes heart from keeping the @entity41 's @entity4 team - mate @entity38 off the scoresheet in a 3 - 3 draw in @entity102 two years ago			1
@entity4 fans were pictured waving handkerchiefs after the final whistle against @entity20 on tuesday in that @entity111 qualifier , only an injury - time equaliser from @entity109 full - back @entity107 prevented @entity1 from recording a famous victory			2
' i remember how @entity114 [ @entity116 midfielder ] was able to stop @entity38			0
' whenever @entity38 was on the side of the pitch , somebody else guarded him			0
' we have to be close and do n't let @entity2 empty space			0
if we wo n't do it , it will kill us			0

@entity4 were beaten 4 - 3 by @entity20 in the @entity24
holders still made it through to quarter - finals despite @entity15 defeat
@entity2 subject of *criticism* outside the *stadium* after the game
@entity2 has failed to score or assist in his past eight matches
