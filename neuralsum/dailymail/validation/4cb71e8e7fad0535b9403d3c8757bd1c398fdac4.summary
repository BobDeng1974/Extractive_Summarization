they may light our paths at night , but streetlamps and other sources of artificial light at night time affect the growth and flowering of plants as well as the number of insects , according to a new study			1
researchers have shown that light pollution can impact the natural environment in complex ways that may be hard to predict			1
given that cities are lit up 24 - hours - a - day in many developed countries , there are fears that such ecological impacts may be widespread			0

this image shows the two different types of light treatment used - ‘ white ' light similar to newer commercial @entity27 street lighting systems and an ' amber ' light simulating a type of sodium street lamp researchers from the @entity33 simulated the effects of street lighting on artificial grassland plots containing a community of invertebrates at night			1
they exposed them to two different types of light treatment - a ‘ white ' light similar to newer commercial @entity27 street lighting systems and an ' amber ' light simulating the type of sodium street lamp still found in much of the @entity47 and further afield			1
the experiments investigated the effects of the lighting on the population density of a species of pea aphid			1
the low intensity amber light was shown to prevent flowering in a wild relative of peas and beans called greater bird 's foot trefoil , which is a key source of food for the pea aphid in grasslands and road verges , especially in mid-summer			1
the study showed that low intensity amber light caused by street lighting in cities ( a stock image of @entity71 at dusk is shown ) prevented flowering in a wild relative of peas and beans called greater bird 's foot trefoil , which is a key source of food for the pea aphid in grasslands and road verges , especially in mid summer bright lights in @entity82 ’s cities may be causing urban blackbirds to reach sexual maturity quicker their country cousins			1
animal biologists from @entity87 and the @entity88 for @entity89 in @entity90 , near @entity91 , fitted tiny light loggers to the backs of 100 blackbirds in the city of @entity91 and in a nearby forest			1
the light loggers tracked the amount of light birds in both environments were exposed to each day and sent the data to experts			1
they found that the additional light from artificial sources caused the city birds to perceive the days to be longer by 49 minutes on average			1
the additional light had an effect on the city birds ’ photoperiod , which is the part of the day that organisms use to time their daily and seasonal biology			2
as a result , the birds in early march experienced the day length that their country counterparts experienced in late march , according to the study published in journal @entity120 the city birds ’ perception that they were living at a later point in the year caused them to reach sexual maturity in anticipation of breeding season 19 days earlier than the forest birds			1
study leader dr @entity129 of the university , said : ‘ artificial light at night is one of the most obvious environmental changes affecting the habitat of wild animals			1
‘ the global increase in light pollution poses new challenges to wild species , but we ’re very much in the early stages of understanding the effects of exposure to light at night			1
' they found that the number of aphids declined under the light treatment in mid-august due to the limited amount of food available			1
professor @entity151 , director of the environment and @entity154 ( @entity152 ) said : ‘ these are the first findings from major long - term experiments … and already reveal how profound the impacts of artificial night time lighting can be on even simple communities of organisms			1
’ dr @entity162 added : ‘ our results suggest that by lighting up our night time environment we trigger complex effects on natural food webs			1
‘ while we are all aware that street lights often attract insects at night , we show that they may have more permanent , widespread impacts on wildlife and ecosystems			1
’ another study carried out at the university , along with @entity175 , revealed that bats do n’t like streetlights either and that activity was generally lower in street - lit areas than in dark locations with similar habitat			1
the findings have important implications for conservation , overturning the previous assumption that common bats benefited from street - lights because they could feed on the insects that congregated around them			1
the research , published in the journal @entity120 , found that the activity of soprano pipistrelle , noctule and serotine bats was similar or lower in areas with street lighting compared with dark areas			1
an increase in the activity of the @entity47 ’s most common bat , the common pipistrelle , was only seen in locations where there was also a high amount of shelter from trees or hedgerows			0
the only species for which lighting appeared favourable was @entity210 ’s bat , a species common in @entity212 but rare in @entity47			2
dr @entity213 said : ‘ people rarely see bats , and when they do it is usually because they are silhouetted by a light			1
‘ because clouds of insects accumulate around lights , there has been an assumption that the bats were getting an easy lunch			1
another study carried out at the university , along with @entity175 , revealed that bats do n’t like streetlights either and are less active around them			1
an increase in the activity of the @entity47 ’s most common bat , the common pipistrelle ( stock image ) , was only seen in sheltered locations ‘ what our work shows is that they are actually usually just as active , if not more so , in adjacent dark areas			2
‘ we already knew that lighting was bad news for rare species such as horseshoe bats			2
‘ now we have demonstrated that , for the common species of vital importance to our ecosystem , lighting is not helpful			2
over recent decades , the number of streetlights , and the brightness of lighting , has grown enormously			2
‘ we also use increasingly powerful lights to illuminate outdoor areas around our homes			0
we urgently need to reverse this trend			0
’ the research analysed large - scale surveys conducted in @entity47 and @entity212 , involving more than 265,000 bat calls at over 600 locations			0
the links between lighting and bats were explored at several spatial scales including car - surveys conducted by volunteers across @entity212 , to shorter surveys conducted by bicycle , and detailed monitoring over multiple nights at specific sites			2
despite frequently being depicted as blind , bats have good eyesight that is adapted for low light conditions			2
dr @entity272 explained : ‘ when we walk out of a lit house into the dark , it takes a while for our eyes to adapt to the darkness			0
‘ the same is true in bats – they are dazzled by bright light and it takes time for their eyes to re-adjust			2
this could affect their ability to navigate			0
‘ in addition , it seems that their ability to hunt insects is reduced in the light			2
so although a bat may be seen flying round and round a streetlamp , it may actually be struggling to catch anything			0
’ in februrary , a study claimed that humans and the urban enviornments we 've created have affected the evolution of a whole host of species - triggering the growth of enormous spiders , the shrinking of fish and the emergence of birds with no fear of man			0
and the changes are happening faster than previously thought which ‘ may have significant implications for ecological and human well - being , ’ according to one expert			2
@entity316 , of the @entity317 , said that until recently , it was assumed that evolutionary change would take too long to affect ecological processes immediately			0
‘ we now have evidence that there is rapid evolution			0
these changes may affect the state of the environment now			0
this is what 's called eco-evolutionary feedback , ’ she said			0
a new study claims that animals living in cities have evolved rapidly because of human influence			0
for example , @entity335 ( b ) have become smaller , blackbirds ( d ) have changed their migratory behaviour , @entity337 ( e ) disperses less seeds in built - up areas , earthworms ( f ) have become tolerant to metal , while white - footed mice ( c ) are carrying more ticks , leading to increased cases of @entity346 in humans professor @entity316 explained that the number and variety of animals living in cities has not simply decreased , but humans are causing them to evolve rapidly			2
‘ many species of mammals , birds , fishes , and insects have learned novel behaviours , such as diet , foraging skills , and anti-predator behaviour , ’ the study says			0
for example , it cites research that found the bodies of fish changed in response to the construction of dams and that @entity371 salmon have become smaller in urban areas			0
in contrast , a study published in august last year found that spiders are growing larger in cities than in rural environments			0
professor @entity316 said that changes in animals have an effect on ‘ ecosystem functions such as biodiversity , nutrient cycling , seed dispersal , detoxification , food production and ultimately on human health and well - being			0
’ in addition to the growing spiders and shrinking salmon , she cited earthworms with increased tolerance to metals and seeds of some plants dispersing less effectively			0
earthworms have adapted genetically to a series of soil contaminates , including arsenic and certain plants also have also developed an increased tolerance for heavy metals in brownfield sites in cities			0
worryingly , the study also points to evidence of changes in a type of urban mouse , that may have health consequences for humans			0
some white - footed mice in @entity414 were found to be a ‘ critical host ’ for black - legged ticks that carry the bacterium that causes @entity346			0
professor @entity316 ’s study says that thriving mouse populations allow more ticks to survive and lead to predictable spikes in human exposure to the illness			0
it also discusses how songbirds are becoming tamer and bolder , as well as changing their tunes to ensure their acoustic signals are not lost in the noisy urban background .			0

researchers from the @entity33 simulated the effects of street lighting on artificial grassland plots containing insects
they exposed them to two types of light spewed out by streetlamps
found amber light stopped a wild relative of peas flowering
plant is a key source of food for aphids and their numbers declined
other studies have shown that bats are less active around artificial lighting and that blackbirds reach sexual maturity faster
