the @entity0 are still bleary - eyed and they ’ve just rolled out of bed to see the @entity3 trophy knocked over on the floor , sticky with spillages from last night ’s steins			1
a sharp pain is spreading from temple to temple ; the tongue is dry , throat coarse			0
there is a sick , dull feeling in the pit of the stomach from a 4am kebab			0
as hangovers go , @entity3 ones can be the worst			2
three wins from their seven games since @entity21 scored in stoppage time against @entity23 to lift football ’s greatest prize - two of those against against @entity27 and @entity28 - and this one is proving particularly hard to shake off			1
@entity30 have struggled for results following their @entity33 victory last summer @entity21 scores the winning goal for @entity30 against @entity23 to hand @entity30 their fourth @entity3 @entity30 2 - 4 @entity23 ( friendly ) @entity30 2 - 1 @entity27 ( @entity37 qualifier ) @entity38 2 - 0 @entity30 ( @entity37 qualifier ) @entity30 1 - 1 @entity40 ( @entity37 qualifier ) @entity30 4 - 0 @entity28 ( @entity37 qualifier ) @entity43 0 - 1 @entity30 ( friendly ) @entity30 2 - 2 @entity44 ( friendly ) they have not been helped by the loss of influential captain @entity47 through retirement , or that his successor to the armband @entity51 , another key figure in @entity53 2014 , has been out injured since			1
his return to the squad for their draw with @entity44 , through which he sat on the bench , and the @entity37 qualifier against @entity60 , has been welcomed by manager @entity61			1
‘ we need him on the field and outside as well , ’ @entity61 said			0
‘ it 's a great benefit for us to have him back			0
’ he could be the strong coffee they need to wake up after defeat by @entity38 and a draw with @entity40 in their group means , on current form , they are heading towards disaster , admittedly still a long way in the distance			1
@entity30 have not been helped by the loss of influential captain @entity47 through retirement @entity80 star @entity79 is one of the few @entity30 players to maintain his fine form @entity79 has continued where he left off , their five - goal @entity3 top scorer netting four times since , but he is one of the few to maintain last summer ’s form			1
he is clearly one of those annoying people who get up after the night before and are out of the house before anyone else is awake			0
the @entity0 have prided themselves on bringing through youngsters and @entity61 has handed 74 players their debuts since he took over in 2006 , during which time he led them to runner - up in @entity96 , third in the @entity97 and also to the semi-finals of @entity99			2
yet in their most recent squad he named 16 of the side who featured in the @entity3 and invited no newcomers			2
low has already been backed beyond @entity106 2016 to stay in charge until after the 2018 @entity3 in @entity108 , and is adamant they can build on their achievements			0
‘ it was a decision where my heart and my mind both said yes , ’ @entity61 said , on signing a new contract earlier this month			0
@entity23 claimed revenge on the @entity3 winners with a 4 - 2 friendly victory in september last year @entity30 have been desperate for the return of captain @entity51 ( left ) midfielder @entity119 has been brought back into fold following 14 months out with a back injury @entity30 boss @entity61 ( centre ) is adamant his side can build on their achievements ( left to right ) @entity51 , @entity79 , @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 were on the bench for @entity30 during the 2 - 2 draw against @entity44 on wednesday night ‘ we waited a long time for the success that we had in @entity53 and we all want to experience that again			1
we have the prerequisites to achieve it once more			0
’ his assistant @entity135 and goalkeeping coach @entity136 have also extended their stay with him			0
the main additions @entity61 has made to the squad are those returning from long - term injuries			1
midfielder @entity119 has been brought back into fold following 14 months out with a back injury			0
defender @entity145 missed two years with consecutive knee injuries and has returned			0
so too midfielder @entity147 after his ankle ligament tear ruled him out of playing in @entity53			0
@entity30 suffered a 2 - 0 defeat by @entity38 in their @entity151 match last october @entity44 players celebrate during their 2 - 2 international friendly draw against @entity30 on wednesday @entity61 has been experimenting in recent months			1
against @entity44 , he tried a three - man defence of @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity145 , who had not played together before and clearly struggled			2
@entity47 , one of the best full backs and defensive midfielders in the game , was always going to be difficult to replace , and that will be a key test for @entity61			1
if the @entity3 last summer is still looking a little fuzzy for @entity30 , the future is far from clear either			1
@entity79 celebrates his goal against @entity27 during a rare victory for his side since the @entity3			2

@entity30 have won just three games since 2014 @entity3 success
@entity61 's side were poor in their 2 - 2 draw with @entity44
@entity3 winners suffered defeats against @entity23 and @entity38
@entity30 have had to cope with the retirement of @entity47
@entity51 is only just returning from injury
