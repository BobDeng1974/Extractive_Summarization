@entity0 made his first ever signing as @entity2 manager exactly 18 years ago on monday when he brought 17 - year - old striker @entity3 to the club from @entity5			1
the long - serving @entity7 boss has been responsible for bringing in some of the greatest talent the @entity9 has seen during his time in north @entity12 , as well as some flops along the way too			0
here , @entity15 picks out the best signing from each of @entity0 's 18 seasons in charge of the club			1
@entity3 @entity0 's first signing as @entity2 manager , 18 years ago on monday 1996 - 97 @entity3 - £ 500,000 from @entity5 @entity3 was @entity0 's very first signing for @entity2 and the young @entity24 striker went on to top score for the club in the 1998 - 99 season with 17 @entity9 goals			1
he earned the @entity30 award but fans turned on him because of a perceived poor attitude and @entity0 sold @entity3 to @entity33 for £ 22m			0
the young @entity24 striker was @entity2 's top scorer in the 1998 - 99 season before he was sold to @entity33 1997 - 98 @entity34 - £ 7million from @entity35 the pacey @entity37 winger thrilled @entity2 fans with his direct style of play down the left flank and @entity34 scored in the @entity43 final in his debut season			0
he went on to make 100 @entity9 appearances for club before moving to @entity48 giants @entity47 for £ 25m , making him the most expensive @entity37 footballer at the time			0
@entity34 joined the @entity7 from @entity35 for £ 7m and was sold to @entity47 three seasons later for £ 25m 1998 - 99 @entity52 - £ 3million from @entity53 the little - known midfielder became a transfer record for a @entity57 player when @entity0 brought him to @entity59 and he went on to develop a reputation for scoring important goals in big games			1
@entity52 scored more than 70 goals for the @entity7 and made more than 300 appearances during a nine - year spell at @entity2 winning two @entity9 titles and three @entity67			1
@entity52 became the most expensive @entity57 player ever when he joined @entity2 for £ 3m 1999 - 00 @entity69 - £ 11million from @entity70 @entity0 's greatest ever signing , @entity69 joined the club from @entity70 as a left winger before he was transformed into one of the @entity9 's most deadliest strikers			1
@entity69 is fifth on the all - time goalscoring list and was the star player in @entity2 's title - winning invicibles side in the 2003 - 04 season as he netted 30 times			0
@entity0 turned @entity69 from a winger into one of the deadliest strikers in @entity9 history 2000 - 01 @entity84 - £ 6million from @entity85 @entity2 fought off competition from @entity33 to secure @entity84 ' signature from @entity85 and the former @entity88 international was worth every penny of the £ 6m fee			1
the graceful midfielder contributed goals and assists as he played a key role in the @entity7 ' double - winning season in 2001 - 02 and reproduced his scintillating form as he was selected in the @entity98 for three consecutive seasons			0
former @entity88 international @entity84 played a key role in @entity2 's double - winning side in 2001 - 02 2001 - 02 @entity102 from @entity103 the former @entity105 international made the contentious move to switch north @entity12 allegiances after joining @entity2 from fierce rivals @entity103 on a free transfer			0
any danger of supporters not taking to the commanding defender was quickly dispelled as he helped @entity0 's side claim the double during his first season at the club			0
@entity116 made switch from @entity103 to @entity2 and helped @entity7 win the double in his first season 2002 - 03 @entity120 - £ 4.5million from @entity121 a series of impressive displays during the 2002 @entity124 with @entity125 earned @entity120 a move to the @entity9 champions and the midfielder fitted seamlessly into @entity0 's side			2
the @entity130 made 35 @entity9 appearances during his debut season and formed a formidable partnership at the heart of the @entity2 side with @entity136			0
@entity130 @entity120 formed a formidable partnership with @entity136 in the middle of midfield 2003 - 04 @entity140 from @entity47 pinched from @entity47 as a 16 - year - old , @entity141 , one of @entity0 's greatest success stories , broke into the @entity2 side as a teenager and eventually took on @entity136 's no 4 shirt after the @entity24 left for @entity70			1
the @entity48 international went on to captain the @entity7 despite his young age , becoming one of the best @entity2 players post-invincible era , but he could not resist the overtures from boyhood club @entity152 and sealed a £ 35m switch before joining @entity155 last summer			2
@entity141 joined @entity2 as a 16 - year - old and went on to captain @entity0 's side 2004 - 05 @entity158 from @entity85 another young player plucked from relative obscurity by @entity0 , @entity159 endeared himself to the @entity2 fans with his no - nonsense tough - tackling approach			1
but after staking his claim as a regular and an important player in @entity0 's side in 2007 - 08 , @entity159 refused to sign a new contract at @entity2 and left on a free that summer to join @entity167			2
@entity159 broke into the @entity2 team but left on a free transfer to join @entity167 2005 - 06 @entity170 - £ 9million from @entity171 @entity170 burst on to the scene as a 16 - year - old as a product of the famed @entity171 academy and convinced @entity0 to sign him after making just 21 appearances in the @entity177			1
@entity170 enjoyed his best season in 2012 - 13 when he netted 14 @entity9 goals but has endured two years of injury hell that has prevented the pacey forward from fulfilling his early promise			0
@entity0 signed a 17 - year - old @entity170 from @entity171 and he has gone on to make 159 appearances 2006 - 07 @entity184 - £ 1million from @entity185 the central midfielder , currently on loan at @entity188 , was another from @entity0 's crop of young stars that went on to enjoy huge success in the first team			1
originally considered nothing more than a destroyer in the middle of the park , @entity184 's technical ability and range of passing was evident in his final two seasons with the club as he struck up an accord with @entity204 , setting up a number of the @entity37 striker 's goals before he moved on to @entity47			0
@entity184 joined @entity2 for £ 1m and was eventually sold to @entity47 for £ 15m 2007 - 08 @entity208 - £ 6million from @entity209 another in the long list of @entity24 players @entity0 successfully brought to @entity2 , @entity208 became one of the @entity9 's best right backs during his seven years at the club			1
equally adept at going forward as he was defending @entity208 was twice named in the @entity215 @entity98 before leaving the club at the end of his contract to join champions @entity219 last summer			0
@entity208 was signed by @entity0 in 2007 and became one of the @entity9 's best right backs 2008 - 09 @entity221 - £ 15million from @entity222 the little @entity224 forward was hugely influential for @entity2 during his first 18 months at the club after singing on transfer deadline day in january 2009 following a series of impressive displays at @entity229			1
@entity221 scored all four goals for the @entity7 in a 4 - 4 draw against @entity232 shortly after joining and scored 10 league goals the following season before a catastrophic drop in form saw him leave the club			0
@entity221 enjoyed a blistering start to his @entity2 career before his form completely slumped 2009 - 10 @entity241 - £ 10million from @entity35 the @entity243 centre back arrived from @entity35 and appeared to be the solution to @entity2 's vulnerability in defence and even scored on his @entity9 debut during a 6 - 1 win against @entity250			2
his commanding displays saw him elevated to club captain after @entity141 left for @entity47 but @entity241 was dropped from the @entity2 side before he followed in the footsteps of his predecessor and joined the @entity258 club last summer for £ 15m			1
@entity241 appeared to be the answer to @entity2 's defensive frailties before falling out of favour 2010 - 11 @entity262 - £ 10million from @entity263 the @entity24 defender joined the club with a lack of top - flight experience and @entity262 did little to dispel concerns that he lacked @entity9 quality with a slow start to his career in north @entity12			2
but the 29 - year - old has gone on to earn a reputation as one of the best centre - backs in @entity105 and is now one of the first names on @entity0 's team - sheet			2
after a slow start at @entity262 is now considered one of the best defenders in the @entity9 2011 - 12 @entity281 - £ 12million from @entity171 another signing from the @entity171 academy , @entity281 has excited both @entity2 and @entity105 fans in equal measure but his progress has been slowed by a number of injuries			2
@entity289 earned rave reviews following an imperious display in central midfield against @entity167 in the @entity293 during his first season , and at 21 he already has 20 international caps to his name			0
@entity281 's progress has been stalled by a series of injuries but is a clear talent 2012 - 13 @entity301 - £ 16million from @entity302 @entity48 international @entity301 was signed from @entity302 with the club in financial difficulty and the fee paid was considered a bargain for a player of his quality			0
@entity301 scored 12 @entity9 goals during his first season in @entity105 and is hitting similar heights this campaign , scoring important goals to help @entity2 into third in the table			0
signed by @entity0 in 2012 , @entity301 scored 12 goals in his first season at the @entity317 2013 - 14 @entity318 - £ 42.5million from @entity33 he was the singing that @entity2 fans had craved , the marquee that @entity0 had proved so reluctant to bring to the club , and @entity318 made a blistering start to his career at the @entity317			2
the @entity124 winner 's form tailed off towards the end of his first season before injury curtailed this campaign			0
but @entity318 has been in fine form since his recent return to the side , reminding supporters why the club smashed their transfer record to take him from @entity33			0
@entity318 was brought to @entity2 after the club smashed their transfer record 2014 - 15 @entity338 - £ 35million from @entity47 another world class talent , the @entity340 has enjoyed a brilliant first season in @entity105 and is the club 's leading @entity9 scorer with 12 goals			1
@entity338 , who scored 19 @entity346 goals for @entity47 in his final season in @entity48 , has an infectious enthusiasm that seems to inspire his team - mates and the 26 - year - old should still have his best years ahead of him			1
@entity338 was @entity2 's big - money summer signing and is the club 's leading @entity9 scorer			1

@entity0 signed @entity3 18 years ago on monday
@entity2 boss has brought some *incredible* talent to the @entity9
@entity69 was signed from @entity70 for £ 11m in 1999 - 00
@entity141 joined @entity2 as a 16 - year - old from @entity47
@entity338 was signed last summer for £ 35m
