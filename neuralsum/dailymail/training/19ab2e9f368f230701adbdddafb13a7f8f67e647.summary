a blind man finally caught a glimpse of the loving wife who acted as his guide for over a decade after being fitted a bionic eye			1
@entity5 screamed with happiness when @entity7 came into focus , before embracing his wife and erupting into tears of joy			2
the man from @entity13 , @entity14 suffered from a genetic disease called retinitis pigmentosa which stole his eyesight over the course of his life according to @entity20			1
now thanks to a pair of electronic glasses which send signals to the electrodes planted in his damaged retina 's , the 68 - year - old has finally been able to see his wife and ten grandchildren again			1
regarding the device which took over £ 200million and decades to develop , he said : ' it 's crude but significant , it works			2
mr @entity5 , whose genetic disorder progressively wore away his retina , became the first @entity54 and 15th person in the country to receive the technology			1
he remembers the faces of his older grandchildren , but has never seen most of them			0
before the device was switched on , he said : ' i have a lot of fun with my grandkids and family			0
' i think it would be good to recognize when they come in the room , and observe their growing and things like that			0
' my grandkids in @entity74 love playing hide and seek			0
they do n't have to hide anywhere except for a corner of a room , ' @entity5 joked			2
the bionic eye , known as the ' @entity81 ' acts as a retinal prosthesis and was finally approved for use by the @entity84 in january 2014 - after decades or research			1
retinal surgeon dr @entity86 who selected mr @entity5 to receive the bionic eye said : ' it 's a bionic eye , in every sense of the word			1
it 's not a replacement for the eyeball , but it works with interacting with the eye			2
' he equipped his patient with a pair of dark - tinted sunglasses with a camera on the bridge and a fitted computer which sends information to the electrodes implanted in @entity5 's retina - which replace the damaged cells			1
breakthrough : the glasses worn by @entity43 took decades to develop and send electrical impulses to electrodes fitted to his damaged retinas step by step : the glasses do not perfect @entity43 's vision , but they allow him to perceive shapes and light on the mend : before receiving the treatment , @entity43 joked : ' my grandkids in @entity74 love playing hide and seek			1
they do n't have to hide anywhere except for a corner of a room ' once the glasses were turned on , @entity5 exclaimed : ' it 's the flash and i 've got to be able to interpret the changes in that shape			1
' dr @entity86 added : ' @entity130 has been seeking to cure blindness for 2,000 years or more , but only in the past quarter of a century have we had the electronics and the packaging and all the other things come together to build a retinal prosthesis that could restore sight to the blind			2
' two weeks after these pre-operative tests , @entity5 was surrounded by his loving family in the @entity141 when the glasses were turned on again			1
' his whole life we have heard " nothing can be done , nothing can be done " - it 's all we 've heard , until now , ' said @entity147			1
dr @entity86 is already planning on implanting the device in a second patient , while researching future uses for patients who have other eye conditions besides retinitis pigmentosa , like patients with glaucoma , or soldiers who may have lost their eyes in combat			1
in a healthy eye , the rods and cones convert light into tiny electrochemical impulses that are sent through the optic nerve and into the brain , where they are decoded into images			0
if the photoreceptors no longer function correctly the first step in this process is disrupted , and the visual system can not transform light into images			0
the @entity174 ( " @entity81 " ) bypasses the damaged photoreceptors altogether			0
a miniature video camera housed in the patient ’s glasses captures a scene			0
the video is sent to a small patient - worn computer ( i.e. , the video processing unit – @entity183 ) where it is processed and transformed into instructions that are sent back to the glasses via a cable			2
these instructions are transmitted wirelessly to an antenna in the implant			0
the signals are then sent to the electrode array , which emits small pulses of electricity			0
these pulses bypass the damaged photoreceptors and stimulate the retina ’s remaining cells , which transmit the visual information along the optic nerve to the brain , creating the perception of patterns of light			0
patients learn to interpret these visual patterns .			0

@entity5 suffered from genetic eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa
it gradually wore away the 68 - year - old 's retina over the course of his life
after ten years of being blind , he saw again with the aid of bionic glasses
they send electrical signals to electrodes implanted in mr @entity5 's eyes
