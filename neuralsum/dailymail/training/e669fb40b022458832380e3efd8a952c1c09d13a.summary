by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 was accused of ‘ learning nothing ’ from the financial crisis after being fined £ 14.5million for giving unsuitable mortgage advice to tens of thousands of its customers			1
the @entity10 watchdog said the sales processes of @entity3 and subsidiary @entity11 were not ‘ fit for purpose ’ and listed a series of astonishing failings that lasted until march 2013			1
the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) said that about 30,000 customers were exposed to unsuitable advice			1
@entity3 has agreed to contact them to ask them if they have any concerns			2
the @entity3 has been fined £ 14.5 million after the @entity10 regulator found ' serious failings ' in its advice to mortgage customers in one case an adviser told a customer interest rates could hit 5.5 per cent and recommended they lock into a more expensive fixed - rate loan for five years			1
advisers also routinely failed to check whether households could afford to repay their loans			0
this included older customers who were set to retire before the end of the term of the mortgage			0
just two of a sample of 164 sales reviewed by the @entity17 were deemed to be suitable			1
the problems were flagged up to @entity3 by the regulator in november 2011 , but were not rectified until march 2013			1
@entity44 , director of enforcement and financial crime at the @entity17 , said : ‘ taking out a mortgage is one of the most important financial decisions we can make			2
‘ poor advice could cost someone their home so it ’s vital that the advice process is fit for purpose			0
both firms failed to ensure that their customers were getting the best advice for them			0
’ @entity59 , a @entity60 member of the influential @entity61 , said the sanction was not tough enough			0
‘ this fine is peanuts for @entity3 , ’ he said			2
‘ we need a criminal investigation			0
@entity67 , who ran the @entity3 retail unit from august 2012 until his promotion to group chief executive in october last year , said the mortgage advice failings were ' unacceptable and should never have happened ' ‘ this bank obviously has n’t learned its lessons from the financial crisis and no one has had the decency to take responsibility for wrongdoing			1
' it is the sixth time in four years that the state - backed lender has been fined , having already been penalised for rigging @entity83 interest rates and breaching rules against money laundering			0
@entity3 has said in response to the findings at the end of 2012 , it overhauled its mortgage sales process and re-trained all mortgage advisers ( file picture ) but the catalogue of failings in its mortgage advice is arguably the most damaging for the high street giant , which is currently on a mission to boost its mortgage lending and win back the public ’s trust			1
banks , including @entity3 , were blamed for triggering the financial crisis , in part by lending recklessly to households and businesses that could not afford to pay back the money			2
in its report , the @entity17 revealed this reckless approach had continued , with sales staff at @entity3 and @entity11 failing to go through basic checks to determine whether customers could afford a mortgage			1
instead of checking a customer ’s income and outgoings , @entity3 sales staff relied heavily on generic information on household spending published by the @entity118			1
they also lent money to customers in financial difficulty who were seeking to consolidate their debts into their mortgage			0
in one case , a salesman committed 16 ‘ professional standards failings ’ of which ten were considered to be ‘ detrimental ’ to the customer			2
despite this the salesman was given ‘ back - to - basics coaching ’ and allowed to continue to sell to the public			0
the bank said yesterday it had ‘ completely overhauled ’ its sales process and in november 2012 put around 350 mortgage advisers on an intensive four - month training course during which time they were not allowed to provide advice			0
chief executive @entity67 admitted that the service had been ‘ unacceptable and should never have happened ’ .			0
