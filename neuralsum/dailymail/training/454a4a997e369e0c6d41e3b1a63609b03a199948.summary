by @entity0 published : 03:50 est , 22 june 2013 updated : 03:58 est , 22 june 2013 a man who has had 54 cycles of chemotherapy for an inoperable brain tumour has defied doctors by naturally fathering a miracle baby girl			0
@entity7 , 34 , was told the chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment to save his life would leave him infertile			1
but two years ago @entity7 met fiancée @entity12 , 30 , and , against all the odds , the couple are now proud parents to @entity15 , nine months			1
miracle : @entity7 , 34 , was told the chemotherapy to treat his inoperable brain tumour would leave him infertile but he defied doctors by fathering @entity15 , aged nine months , by wife @entity20 @entity21 : @entity7 , @entity20 and @entity15 relax together , left , while the proud father takes his daughter on a trip to the beach @entity7 , who doctors believe is the youngest person in the @entity28 to have had so many rounds of chemotherapy , said : ‘ having such a beautiful baby daughter is just a dream come true			1
‘ when @entity20 told me she was pregnant i thought she must be mistaken			1
and when @entity15 was born it was the happiest day of my life			1
now i am just overjoyed and loving every moment of being a dad			0
’ @entity7 ’s nightmare began on march 2008 just before his 29th birthday			1
the former journalist was out running when his left arm suddenly went numb			2
‘ i obviously collapsed and blacked out because the next thing i remember is being picked up off the road and rushed to hospital			0
’ there , doctors told @entity7 he ’d suffered a seizure , but that as he was fit , it was probably due to low blood sugar			1
however , further scans and tests revealed the worse news possible when he was diagnosed with a @entity54 glioblastoma multiforme brain tumour			0
adorable : @entity15 stares longingly into the eyes of her father , who was struck down with his illness aged just 29 @entity61 's girl : @entity15 's birth was a miracle as doctors told @entity7 he would never have a child , which left him devastated and fearful he would never find love a type of brain cancer , it affects two to three people per 100,000 in the @entity72 and @entity73			1
doctors do n’t know what causes it - but because the tumour was so close to the central part of @entity7 ’s brain , operating on it carried such a high risk of death that surgery was impossible			1
‘ it was a terrible shock , ’ he recalled , ‘ especially when doctors said they could n’t even operate			0
my only hope of survival , of stopping it growing more or spreading , was to have urgent radiotherapy and chemotherapy			0
a side effect of the treatment was that it would leave me infertile – but doctors said there was n’t time to freeze sperm			1
‘ meanwhile i would need to take anti-seizure drugs to prevent fits for the rest of my life			0
’ after the first bouts of radiotherapy and chemotherapy , @entity7 felt so upset about not being able to have children , he visited a fertility specialist and had a sample of sperm frozen			1
but by then he believed having already had so much treatment , it was too late			1
he admits he felt his life was over			0
‘ one day i ’d been a fit young man who lived day to day to being someone who suddenly had no idea what the future would hold			0
‘ my future seemed bleak			0
being told because of the treatment , i could never father a child was terrible – at my lowest point , i worried would any woman want me ? ’ however , within months he had decided to use the experience to reappraise his life			1
‘ i began running more to get myself into really good physical shape , ’ he says , ‘ at the same time i decided to give up my desk job as a journalist and retrain as a tree surgeon			2
grueling : @entity7 prepares for another bout of chemotherapy			1
he has 54 treatments and is thought to be the youngest person in @entity28 to have had so many ‘ being out in the fresh air was incredibly therapeutic			1
’ then in april 2011 at a party he was introduced to @entity20			2
she recalls : ‘ @entity7 was a friend of a friend and i knew he ’d been unwell but that was all			2
however as soon as we started chatting , we hit it off			0
over the next few days the pair rang and spoke on @entity137			0
a few days later they met up again and within weeks they were a couple			0
painful : @entity7 had a biopsy in order to diagnose his tumour , which left him with an enormous scar ‘ i knew very early on i ’d met my soulmate , ’ says @entity20 , ‘ and when about a month into our relationship @entity7 explained to me about his brain tumour and that he could n’t have kids , it did n’t bother me			1
’ @entity7 said : ‘ i was really worried what @entity20 would think so i was incredibly relieved when she said it made no difference to our relationship			1
’ three months later @entity7 moved in with @entity20 in @entity155 , @entity156			1
but within five months she suspected she was pregnant			2
‘ for other health reasons i was also on the pill so at first it seemed a ridiculous thought , ’ she says , ‘ but i got a pregnancy test to check			0
i was stunned when it was positive			0
’ @entity7 was equally shocked – and then thrilled			2
however , the couple ’s initial joy was shortlived when at five weeks , @entity20 started to bleed			2
‘ doctors said it could be a miscarriage and i went for a scan , ’ she says , ‘ but it was too early to be able to see properly so i had to come back for another scan ten days later			0
‘ it was the most agonising wait for both of us so when we finally saw that little heartbeat on the screen , we were incredibly relieved			0
’ the couple were then worried all the drugs @entity7 has taken – including the maximum dose of radiotherapy and over 54 rounds of chemotherapy – might have affected his sperm and the baby in some way			2
@entity20 said : ‘ the chemo is very strong and often @entity7 feels sick and tired taking it			1
’ however , following their threatened miscarriage , @entity20 ’s pregnancy was straightforward and in september last year ( 2012 ) , she gave birth to @entity15 who weighed a healthy @entity191			1
the couple are now set to wed. ‘ i proposed to @entity20 on a beach in @entity194 earlier this year and luckily she said yes , ’ says @entity7			1
he admits being diagnosed with a brain tumour has changed his outlook on life			0
‘ it ’s taught me not to take anything for granted and i truly do appreciate every day			0
’ little miracle : @entity20 had a miscarriage scare before @entity15 was born weighing 6lbs 15oz but he ’s determined to see @entity15 grow up : ‘ brain tumours are unpredictable			1
while some people live a normal life with a brain tumour for very many years , no - one knows what the future holds			2
‘ but having @entity15 has given me another reason to keep well and stay alive			2
and actually , despite everything , i feel lucky			0
i have a very fulfilling life , a wonderful fiance and amazingly , i ’m a proud dad with a gorgeous little girl			0
’ since being diagnosed with a brain tumour , @entity7 has competed in the @entity216 , clocking up a time of 41/2 hours			2
he is now raising money for the charity , @entity219 , by competing in the @entity220 – tackling the highest mountains in @entity223 @entity222 and @entity224 over september 27 - 29			0

@entity7 , 34 , told treatment would leave him infertile
but fiancée @entity20 , 30 , miraculously gave birth to @entity15 , now aged nine months
@entity7 , from @entity155 , @entity156 , was struck down with the *disease* aged 29
he is believed to be youngest person in @entity28 to have had so much chemo
the former journalist still faces a *battle* to live but is determined to see daughter grow up
