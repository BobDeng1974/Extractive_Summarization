the boy 's grandfather believes the decision to print the cartoon , designed by veteran cartoonist @entity47 , was in ' bad taste '			1
@entity49 , 51 , told @entity50 that he has probably cried more times in the last fortnight than he has in 40 years			0
he said : ' it was in very bad taste			0
it was disrespectful and it was not in line with honoring my grandson 's memory			2
the editor of the paper , @entity62 , defended the decision in an op - ed. ' the intent behind our commentary might be to provoke thought , but it should n't be to harm , ' he wrote			1
' i do n't believe @entity69 [ @entity47 ] was intending to hurt a family , though i acknowledge the pain that 's followed			2
it 's a tough one			2
in the cartoon , @entity7 was portrayed as an angel			1
the boy 's heartbroken father @entity75 ( right ) questioned what person had the ' audacity ' to shoot a child and then run away the boy 's mother @entity80 was also inside the home at the time of the shooting and desperatley tried to shield her son			1
she was not hurt ' that portrayal is n't hurtful			0
you see a precious angel that a family lost and who our community should n't forget , just like we should n't forget the vexing problems that lead to tragedy			2
' he added that there had been a range of reactions to the illustration			0
the most emotional however was from @entity7 's family who met @entity62 to express their disgust			1
' the strongest [ reaction ] was from a few family members of @entity7 , who monday and again tuesday spoke with me in person passionately , angrily and with despair over the loss of the little boy and their feelings toward the cartoon and the @entity21 , ' @entity62 wrote			1
' i understand their anger , and i 'm sorry that something we published led to more sorrow in a difficult time			0
' would things have been different if the cartoon published a week later , after more time to heal ? if the baby was n't illustrated so accurately ? ' was there another way to make the same point ? that 's what i 've wrestled with , as i have with other editorial cartoons that i 've declined to run over the years when one crossed a line			2
police ( pictured at the scene in the aftermath of the shooting ) have not made any arrests in the case and do not have any suspects ' it happens more often than you 'd think			2
' @entity47 speaks for himself through his cartoons , it 's my job to decide whether to publish them			0
it 's my job to hear the complaints , occasionally the praise , and publish the opposing viewpoints as well			0
' it 's everyone 's job to keep having conversations that might be difficult and to pray and offer thoughts for a family and a community that 's still hurting			0
' @entity7 's mother , @entity80 , was desperately trying to shield her son from the gunman when he was shot , it is reported			1
she was not hurt in the gunfire and later told police that she did not know the attacker			0
she told @entity160 13 : ' there are no words to describe what has been taken away			0
' i grabbed the baby because i did n’t know where the gunshots were coming from , and i dove to the ground and held him			0
' the boy 's heartbroken father , @entity75 , told @entity160 13 : ' you spend all this time bringing your son up , watching him progress			1
then all of sudden , somebody comes and just takes it all away			0
' ' he [ the suspect ] took a baby from us , and took the mother of another child , ' he added			0
' what person has the audacity to pull something like that and then run ? ' a friend of the family @entity185 has set up a @entity187 page to help the boy 's parents cover the funeral costs			1
