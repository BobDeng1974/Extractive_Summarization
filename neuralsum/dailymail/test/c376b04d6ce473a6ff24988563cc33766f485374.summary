@entity1 defender @entity0 accepts the fallen champions are facing a battle to finish in the top four			1
@entity0 admits confidence is low with sunday 's derby loss at @entity7 having continued a dismal run which has seen @entity1 capitulate in the @entity10 title race			1
@entity12 's men crashed 4 - 2 at @entity13 , a sixth defeat in eight games in all competitions and a result which leaves them fourth and clinging onto a @entity20 place			1
@entity21 leaps onto @entity23 's back after @entity7 take the lead through the big @entity25 , who has had an excellent renaissance recently it is a far cry from the situation on @entity30 , when the defending champions pulled level with @entity33 at the top with a 3 - 2 win over @entity36			1
having been eight points behind just over a month earlier , @entity1 appeared to be clicking into gear - but all has suddenly gone wrong			1
they now trail the leaders by 12 points , having played a game more , and their form continues to offer encouragement for the likes of @entity45 and @entity46 below them			1
a dejected @entity48 and @entity49 look on following their defeat to rivals @entity7 @entity0 said : ' it is time to analyse what we are doing wrong and try to improve for the next few games			1
there are still 18 points to play for and we must be honest with ourselves and start to push hard , play better and win games , so we can get in the top four			0
' when you lose those games it is always really hard , but that is football sometimes			0
' it seems you lose confidence when you can not get results and it was a really tough afternoon			0
' @entity1 were chasing a record fifth successive derby win and the occasion initially seemed to rouse them from their recent troubles as they made a blistering start			2
@entity76 was the rare highlight in an otherwise dismal @entity1 performance at @entity13 @entity76 scored twice , but he had very little to cheer about as @entity1 left the @entity79 empty handed their movement and energy was superb and they claimed a well - worked opening goal through @entity76 after just eight minutes			2
but that was as good as it got as @entity7 equalised through the excellent @entity85 and then took complete control			2
further goals from the impressive @entity23 , @entity88 and @entity89 secured a convincing win before @entity76 's 100th @entity1 goal came as a late consolation			2
' it seems we lost confidence and were nervous , ' said @entity0			0
' then it was hard for the team to react and we conceded the second goal			0
@entity1 's manager @entity12 issues instructions as his side lose to their rivals all of @entity7 's outfield players congratulate celebrate as they score in the derby at @entity13 on sunday ' in the second half we did n't create many chances and when @entity7 scored the third goal the game was over			1
' winger @entity108 was at a loss to explain @entity1 's failure to impose themselves after @entity7 pulled back level			1
the @entity112 said : ' i do n't really know ( what happened )			0
they scored the equaliser and they were back in the game			0
we started strong but it was n't our day and we need to focus on the upcoming games			0
