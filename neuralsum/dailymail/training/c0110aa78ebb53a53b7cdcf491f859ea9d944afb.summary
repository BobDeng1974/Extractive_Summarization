by @entity0 death rates from breast cancer in @entity3 have fallen the most – and at the fastest rate – across @entity5 in the last two decades			1
the drop of up to 41 per cent was hailed as ‘ spectacular ’ and will be an enormous morale - booster for women fighting the disease who now have their best chance of beating it			1
although experts point to better treatments and @entity17 care , the improvements are marked because @entity3 patients started with the worst odds of survival			1
death rates from breast cancer in @entity3 have fallen the most and at the fastest rate across @entity5 in the last two decades in 1987 - 9 , breast cancer mortality rates in @entity23 and @entity24 were the highest in @entity5 at 41.9 per 100,000 women			1
latest data reveals that by 2008 - 2010 , the figure was down to 25.4 per 100,000 – a drop of 40.8 per cent			0
the plummeting levels represent the biggest fall of any @entity5 country from 1989 to 2010 and include patients under 50 who often suffer more aggressive cancers			1
the second highest fall was in @entity35 , which had a 37.9 per cent cut in rates , followed by @entity38 with a 33.5 per cent decrease			0
mortality rates were 25.1 per 100,000 women in @entity35 in 2010 and 25.6 in @entity38 , meaning the @entity3 is on a par with the best in @entity5			1
the plummeting levels represent the biggest fall of any @entity5 country from 1989 to 2010 professor @entity47 presented the findings at the @entity49 in @entity50 , saying his figures showed @entity23 and @entity24 were ‘ best in class ’			1
he said : ‘ the drop in the @entity3 is really spectacular and it ’s now close to all groups of other countries			2
’ the expert , of the @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity60 , said his research shows how the improvement in the @entity3 has gathered pace			0
‘ the other very good news is that we were thinking that the decrease would level off , or stabilise but there has been an acceleration , ’ he added			0
‘ there is no limit that we can see			0
’ the fall in death rates was around one per cent a year from the early 1990s but was nearly two per cent annually more recently			1
prof @entity47 said he hoped that by 2060 ‘ only the most complex cases would prove fatal ’			0
although the number of breast cancer cases continues to rise , reaching around 50,000 a year , the current death toll of almost 12,000 is much lower than two decades ago , he added			2
prof @entity47 attributed the ‘ dramatic ’ change to better treatments , better awareness among women and health professionals , and better organisation within the @entity17			0
however , he added , the fall in deaths would not have been possible without advances in drugs and other treatments			0
@entity88 , more effective drugs and the growing availability of multi-disciplinary treatments should encourage a further downward trend in deaths from breast cancer , he predicted			0
in 1987 - 9 , @entity95 had @entity5 ’s lowest death rates , at 20 per 100,000			1
however , by 2008 - 2010 , the country was recording 22 per 100,000 , meaning mortality levels have risen			0
the figures also show @entity60 was one of the worst performing countries over the last 20 years , with a cut of only 17 per cent in death rates			1
it had the lowest reduction of any @entity5 country in death rates of women under 50			1
prof @entity47 said ‘ there is something going on here that we do n’t understand ’ as @entity60 devotes substantial resources to cancer care and women there have access to the best treatment			0
but screening has failed to make an impact in countries like the @entity3 as it did not detect deadly cancers at an earlier stage , he added			0
baroness @entity124 , chief executive of @entity125 , said : ‘ by continuing to invest in vital research , we will be able to overcome breast cancer by 2050			2
’ dr @entity129 , research manager at @entity130 , said routine access to new treatments is vital to cutting death rates			2
he added : ‘ breast cancer is not yesterday ’s problem – one woman is diagnosed every ten minutes			2

the drop of up to 41 per cent was hailed as ‘ spectacular ’
@entity3 patients started with the worst odds of survival
breast cancer death rates in @entity23 and @entity24 were the highest in @entity5
levels represent biggest fall of any @entity5 country from 1989 to 2010
