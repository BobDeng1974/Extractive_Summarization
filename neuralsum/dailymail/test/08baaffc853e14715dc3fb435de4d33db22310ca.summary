@entity0 essential : this laminated document announces the new @entity3 nursing school and lists the language entry requirements for would - be nurses militants fighting for the islamic state terror group in @entity8 have announced that all nurses working in areas under their control must speak @entity0 - something the @entity13 still has n't introduced			1
revealing plans to open a school of nursing in @entity18 , the extremists also disclosed the tough entry requirements for prospective medical workers			1
among them are rules that applicants are no more than 25 years of age , must be willing to work anywhere inside the territory controlled by the extremists , and must speak fluent @entity0			0
the latter rule is something that even the @entity13 has yet fully put in place , with nurses who trained in @entity32 countries still able to treat patients without any formal language checks thanks to bureaucratic rules barring the @entity36 testing @entity38 candidates			1
details of the first nursing school to be opened in @entity3 - held territory were revealed by on @entity42 by @entity43 is being slaughtered silently - an activist group based in the @entity8 city that uses a network of brave informers to document the daily atrocities carried out by the @entity7 extremists			1
@entity50 shared a photograph of a laminated document written in @entity53 giving details of the new medical school and listing the entry requirements for would - be nurses			1
it states that all candidates be aged between 18 and 25 , pass an entry exam , impress during an interview , graduated from secondary school with science qualifications , be willing to travel to any @entity3 - held area , and willing work for @entity3 institutions for at least two years after graduating			0
the document also states the importance of @entity0 - saying candidates will not be accepted without knowing how to speak and understand the language			0
this is in stark contrast with @entity73 where @entity0 language checks for all nurses are still not being enforced , despite legislation being passed last month making them a legal requirement			1
@entity79 : @entity3 has @entity0 language rules for all nurses			1
the @entity13 does not have the same level of checks although the law has changed , the @entity36 must engage in a lengthy consultation process , draft new legislation and seek council approval before it can test the @entity0 language skills of nurses who trained within the @entity38			1
students graduating from @entity3 ' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating			2
however the announcement in @entity18 promised that graduate nurses who achieved top grades and showed the most promise at the school will be considered for places as @entity3 ' medical school , where they can train for better paid jobs such as doctors and surgeons			2
@entity3 ' @entity0 language rules have been put in place long before the @entity13 has been able to bring in similar checks			1
militants : students graduating from @entity3 ' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating @entity3 has launched @entity0 - language radio news bulletins on its @entity111 broadcast service - complete with information on the latest suicide bombings and ' martyrdom operations '			1
the extremist group 's first @entity0 bulletin aired on tuesday on its @entity118 radio network , which already boasts updates in both @entity53 and @entity120			0
the nine - and - a - half minute broadcast , which begins and ends with traditional sounding @entity53 music , is hosted by a man with an @entity125 accent , who takes the listener through the main events of the day			0
it also boasts of @entity3 fighters ' roasting the flesh ' of their opponents , car bombs killing people and destroying an ' idol ' and so - called ' martyrdom operations '			0
it ends thanking the listener for ' tuning in '			0
last year the law was changed to make it legal for all foreign nurses , midwives and dentists from outside the @entity38 to be forced to take an @entity146 language exam if it was felt their @entity0 made them unsafe in a medical environment			2
since then 429 doctors from outside the @entity38 have been refused a licence to practise medicine in the @entity73 because their @entity0 language skills are not up to scratch			2
similar rules were passed last month extending those rules to prospective medical who trained inside the @entity38 , a rule quickly adopted by doctors and dentists			0
the rule is still not being by the @entity36 , however , as the regulator requires a lengthy public consultation process before it can amend its rules			2
even then the law will only apply to candidates who medical authorities judge could be a danger due to poor @entity0 language skills			0
in such an instance the nurse would first be required to prove sufficient @entity0 experience - such as from a gcse - style qualification - or they will be forced to take the @entity174 's @entity146 qualification , to access whether they have reached a suitable level for their job .			0

@entity3 has announced that all nurses working for them must speak @entity0
rule was one of the entry requirements for a new nursing school in @entity18
@entity13 has also attempted to introduce @entity0 language checks for nurses
but despite the law being approved , a lengthy consultation process means @entity38 - trained nurses are still being employed without @entity0 tests
