a female anteater left zoologists at a @entity3 conservation center baffled after unexpectedly giving birth more than a year and a half after being separated from her mate			1
officials at the @entity8 said they had removed the only male anteater from the enclosure in august , long before the six - month gestation period for baby @entity11 would have begun			1
however , the mystery of how @entity15 the anteater eventually conceived has finally been revealed as ' embryonic diapause '			1
it 's not virgin birth in the strict sense of the phrase , however embryonic diapause happens when a mother puts a fertilized egg on hold in her uterus			1
how did @entity11 come into being ? embryonic diapause - not virgin birth in the strict sense of the phrase , but embryonic diapause happens when a mother puts a fertilized egg on hold in her uterus mysterious anteater birth : @entity11 , pictured , was unexpectedly born at a @entity3 conservation center after his mother and father were separated months prior no male mate : officials at the @entity8 told the @entity38 they had removed the only male anteater from the enclosure in @entity40 , but little @entity11 was born in april regardless if environmental conditions are n’t right , the mother can prevent the fertilized egg from implanting and developing for long periods of time			1
the process has never been observed in an anteater , however it has been documented in armadillos			2
whilst zookeepers may not have witnessed @entity15 with her male companion , @entity50 , at some point they actually were together			2
some scientific papers have mentioned the scenario in which an animal 's body pauses a pregnancy until environmental conditions are right			2
‘ when she gives birth , her entire uterus is going to clear out , ’ @entity58 , species survival plan coordinator for the @entity61 population of giant anteaters , told the @entity38			0
‘ anything that 's in her uterus , even another undeveloped embryo , would clear out			0
’ egg delay : @entity70 , founder and director of the conservation center , suspects this might be a rare case of delayed implantation , when fertilized eggs remain dormant in the uterus for a period of time ( @entity80 photo ) for weeks there had been theories as to how @entity15 became pregnant			1
some had suggested parthenogenesis , or for want of a better term , a virgin birth			0
during such cases , the embryo grows and develops in the absence of fertilization			0
it sounds unusual — some might even say miraculous — but it ’s a surprisingly common occurrence in the animal kingdom			0
researchers believe that an absence of available males likely drives the phenomenon			0
although the exact mechanisms of parthenogenetic reproduction can vary from species to species , all parthenogenesis produces normal , healthy offspring .			0

@entity15 the anteater had *n't* been with her mate in the months before she conceived
zoologists say a fertilized egg was likely ' on hold ' until conditions for pregnancy were right
when @entity11 was born , it gave the impression of *immaculate* *conception*
