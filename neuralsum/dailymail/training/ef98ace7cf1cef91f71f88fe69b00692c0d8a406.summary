@entity5 was also sentenced for unlawfully wounding bystander @entity14 , who was hit in the buttock by one of two bullets			1
the @entity26 was oblivious that the person was @entity5 - who had just pulled out a gun from his bum bag , @entity25 reported			1
@entity5 , whose cleanly - shaven head showed his tattoos on his skull , was somewhat expressionless during the sentencing at the @entity34 in @entity35			0
in sentencing , @entity34 @entity36 said it was inconceivable that any prior conflict or vendetta between @entity5 and @entity8 could justify @entity5 's ' brazen contempt ' for public safety			2
' what you did there with that weapon shattered the peace of a place in which citizens generally feel safe as they go about their leisurely business , ' @entity43 told the heavily - tattooed bikie in the dock			0
' your conduct exposed a large number of people to a real and present - and also alien and entirely unexpected - danger			0
' @entity43 said it ' remained a mystery ' that mr @entity59 was armed with a knife , and @entity5 with a handgun , to both go on a shopping trip with their families			2
' when you saw each other , neither the presence of family nor of large numbers of innocent bystanders , discouraged you from a confrontation which resulted in @entity8 and ms @entity14 , a person unknown to you , being shot , ' he said @entity25 reported			1
@entity5 confronts @entity8 ( pictured wearing a white top and wearing a cap ) it will be almost 10 years before @entity5 is eligible for parole after he was declared a serious violent offender , which means he must serve at least 80 per cent of his sentence behind bars			1
his defence barrister @entity79 told the sentencing hearing his client wrote a letter to ms @entity14 and arranged to pay her $ 10,000 compensation , actions that showed ' genuine remorse '			2
@entity43 shaved 21 months off the 14 - year sentence he originally intended to give @entity88 , but said that was due to the amount of time the father of one spent in jail awaiting sentence			0
the court heard ms @entity14 was still psychologically affected by the incident and that some bullet residue remained in her wound			2
@entity59 , who had brandished a knife during the confrontation , walked away with only minor injuries to his shoulder			0
@entity43 said it was only down to good luck that other bystanders were n't wounded			0
@entity5 's lawyer had argued at an earlier sentencing hearing that his client had acted in self - defence			0
however , @entity43 said even if that was true , the jury in @entity5 's trial had been entitled to find the tattooist 's reaction was ' grossly disproportionate ' and ' abhorrent '			0
