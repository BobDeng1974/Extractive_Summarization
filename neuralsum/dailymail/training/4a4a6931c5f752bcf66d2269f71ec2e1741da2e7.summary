judge @entity0 ruled that the boy must stay in the @entity2 to be close to his father after agreeing that video calls were no substitute for physical contact a mother who wanted to relocate to @entity8 taking her son with her and leaving the father behind in @entity11 has had her request turned down because ' you ca n't hug @entity14 '			1
the mother of the two - year - old boy said the child could stay in contact with his father using phone calls , internet video calls , and visits			1
however , the man argued that visiting @entity8 regularly was impractical , and that internet services were often unreliable and did n't substitute for physical contact			1
and at the @entity25 today judge @entity0 said the plan was inadequate because ' you ca n't hug @entity14 ' , adding that he did not believe the mother would stick to her commitments			1
mr @entity30 added : ‘ the disadvantages of @entity14 - as any user will know - are all too often the lack of clarity of image , the sound delay even if short and , as counsel colourfully notes in her closing submissions , " you ca n’t hug @entity14 "			1
’ rejecting the mum ’s case , he continued : ‘ this is a case where a father , despite obstacles , has built up a very good and profound attachment to his son			0
‘ the mother ’s proposals to relocate - even if her proposals for visits , telephone calls and @entity14 calls are carried out - in practice do not make up for these losses			2
‘ for the avoidance of doubt , i do not believe this mother once in @entity8 , if given permission , would adhere to the contact regime pre-figured in her case			0
‘ even if i am wrong about that and she started the programme , it would , having seen her and heard her , only in my view be a matter of time before this regime faltered and collapsed			0
‘ i simply did not , in the light of my findings ... believe her as to her intentions			0
’ sitting at @entity75 's @entity25 , mr @entity74 added that , even if the difficulties with @entity14 could be resolved , he did not believe that the mother would keep in contact with the father he continued : ‘ both these parents are capable of raising [ the child ] physically and of giving him physical care and nurture			0
‘ it is the mother ’s inability to recognise in any real way the value to [ the child ] of having his father in his life and to facilitate and encourage it which leads me to find that in reality she would let [ the child ’s ] opportunities for continuing and developing his relationship with his father wither or even cease abruptly			0
’ the decision means the boy will stay in @entity11 , where he can have direct contact with his father .			2
