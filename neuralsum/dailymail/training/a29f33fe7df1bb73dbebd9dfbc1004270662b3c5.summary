we ran down to see what we could do and they were beached about 20 yards from the sands and seemed very distressed			2
' i went in and tried to get them out but they kept coming back in			0
with some of the bigger ones we had to get a strap and put it under them and lift them			0
' we had to move them into the deeper water and hold them under using this strap so they could get their sat - nav sorted			1
at its eepest , the water was up to my shoulders and neck			2
' ms @entity31 , 48 , added : ' @entity129 was definitely the hero			0
we just could n’t believe what had happened			0

he said the family have rented the house on the @entity14 for ten years but have never had to act as heroes before			2

it is very remote , there is n’t much out there , ' he said			0
' it will probably never happen again			0
i do a lot of snorkelling and have swam with seals before but i have never had any dealings with dolphins			2
' hero ' : mr @entity32 said he was forced to carry the dolphins out to water that was up to his neck so that they could swim to safety ' i was n’t sure what they would be like , they were obviously stressed and you could hear them squeaking very loudly			2
' they must have been talking to each other but they seemed to know what we were doing and that we wanted to help them			0

sighting and strandings officer @entity178 , 28 , said : ' it was a really unusual event and the family did everything right			0
' it was in a very isolated place , so it was very lucky that the family spotted them			0
' mr @entity178 also described the ' mass stranding ' at @entity13 as unusual , saying : ' common dolphins normally live in deeper waters , so they do n’t tend to get beached			1
' between 100 and 150 dolphins had been going through the waters nearby at that time			0
the dolphins that became beached were part of a splinter group			0
' it ’s that time of year when they move a bit closer to the shore , possibly for fish , and the mackerel come right in close to the beach			2
' he added : ' a " mass stranding " means that more than two individuals have been affected			0
the last one of this scale was in @entity75 in june 2008 when 26 dolphins became beached			1
