@entity0 never backs down from a challenge			0
over the years the @entity2 has competed in both individual and team adventure races at the elite level all over the world			1
but none of these exhausting endurance tests compare to an even bigger battle – her fight with @entity10			1
it was while travelling through @entity12 at the age of 24 that she found out she 'd contracted it			2
in an interview with the age last year @entity0 said the prognosis was the worst it could possibly be			2
@entity0 's battle with @entity10 has driven her on to greater things she was given only five years to live			1
feeling devastated and a long , long way from home , all she felt was a sense of shame and isolation			2
‘ the shame stayed with me for so long			0
i contracted @entity10 from my boyfriend and yet i felt shameful for it			1
what is shameful about having a boyfriend and a sexual relationship ? because @entity10 was a part of it , it left me with this disgusting shameful feeling , ' she said			2
thankfully for @entity0 the future was not as bad as was predicted			0
her life was saved by the advent of @entity10 drugs , and from here on she vowed to make use of every day			2
@entity0 represented @entity2 in the @entity43 competition her miraculous tale continued last week when she beat hundreds of men for the chance to compete in one of the toughest physical challenges on earth			1
on november 15 , @entity0 represented @entity2 in the @entity50 ’s @entity43 ( @entity51 ) – a 24 - hour non-stop obstacle course in @entity53			1
the 45 - year - old mother of two was the only woman in the @entity2 team of four , and had competed against hundreds of men and women to earn her spot on the team			1
an amazing 800 people pulled out in the course of the race , but not @entity0			0
the @entity51 is designed to push @entity63 to their physical and mental limits			0
the endurance test is an eight kilometre loop course in the desert of @entity53 , @entity69 , with 29 obstacles per lap. as @entity71 reported , it was nothing she could n't handle			0
in the @entity74 the aim is to run as many laps as possible			0
in addition to the obstacles , competitors also battle with the elements			0
everything from sandstorms with winds of over 100 km - an - hour whipping the runners ' faces with sand , to a wind chill factor that can get down to as low as minus five degrees at night , were just a few of the hardships she had to endure			1
the 45 - year - old mother of two was the only woman in the @entity2 team of four ‘ obstacle racing attracts an incredible amount of women			1
sometimes the women outnumber the men			0
it is a sport where for most the pressure is off and they can go around the course in a group of friends			0
i love the sport for that reason , ’ she told @entity71			0
after what she has been through in her personal life it would also be safe to say that she loves life in general every single day too			0
and it 's her memories of those darks times in 1994 when she was first diagnosed with @entity10 that keeps driving her on			1
‘ every woman feels shame , disgust , anger , dirty , damaged , fearful , loss , regret , despair , shock and most importantly we feel alone , ’ @entity0 said about discovering she had @entity10			1
'' whether a woman chooses to share her @entity10 diagnosis with others or not … there will always be a sense of being alone			2
' @entity0 celebrates with the @entity2 team after finishing the @entity125 competition now as well as her family , the athletic community from around the world will make sure she never feels that alone again			0
800 people pulled out of the 24 - hour non-stop obstacle course in @entity53 , but not @entity0			1

@entity133 's world fell apart when she was diagnosed with @entity10 in 1994
despite feelings of shame and despair she *refused* to be *disheartened*
the 45 - year - old now runs in some of the world 's toughest endurance races
last week she finished the @entity50 ’s @entity43 24 - hour event
' obstacle racing attracts an incredible amount of women , ' she says
