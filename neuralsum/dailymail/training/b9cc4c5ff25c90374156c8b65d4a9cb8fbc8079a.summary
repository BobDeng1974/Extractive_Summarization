as you ’ll know by now , @entity1 ’s spring fight with @entity2 has been put back because @entity1 has injured his elbow			1
it ’s heartbreaking for @entity1 because he desperately wants a @entity7 fight before he hangs up his gloves , but i am already looking at the possibility of rescheduling for a summer fight against @entity12			1
other fights such as @entity14 and @entity15 have also been discussed - we will see how it plays out			1
from @entity1 ’s point of view , this latest setback is tough to take			1
we were so close to getting all the details in place for a march 28 fight , but three weeks into training he hurt his elbow			0
he is the consummate professional and has fought injured before but he wo n’t make that mistake again , especially for what might be his last bout			0
@entity1 only made the call to postpone last week so now he will take some time to digest that and in the meantime i ’m looking at the options			2
this setback has been frustrating for all of us			0
i have worked on it for months			0
@entity1 wants to fulfil one of his dreams by fighting in @entity7 before he hangs up his gloves @entity1 's march 28 fight with @entity2 ( left ) has been postponed because of injury a fight against @entity15 has been discussed - but money will determine the route he goes down a @entity12 fight still appeals a lot to us and whatever route we go the deal has to be right			1
that will be key in whatever fight he takes , whether it is against @entity12 , @entity14 , @entity15 or anyone else			1
@entity1 is a warrior – everyone knows that			2
and that is why he would love to fight @entity15			2
it would be a fight for the ages but both men would need to be rewarded for that			0
those details need to be right			0
likewise against @entity14 – they are great names and great fighters but so is @entity1 so the deal has to suit all parties			1
watch this space because @entity1 will be going out with a bang			2
one man waiting in the wings is @entity69 , mandatory challenger for @entity1 ’s @entity71 belt			2
@entity69 is looking to become the first @entity73 gold medalist to go on and win a world title - expect a big announcement on his opponent soon and history to be made this spring			1
@entity14 has passed 50 but is showing no signs of slowing down and wants ' at least one more fight ' @entity80 is set for his big homecoming in @entity82 on march 28			1
the guy is so excited after everything he has been through and we will announce his opponent on thursday			0
i ’d back him to beat anyone – @entity88 included			2
the opponent is not totally decided yet			0
we have been looking at @entity91 , who is no 1 ranked contender for @entity80 ’s world title			1
we ’ve also looked at @entity93 and @entity94 , but there are maybe half a dozen names in the frame			0
he has been training hard after what happened in @entity99 and it is great that he is finally closing in on the first defence of his title			0
i ’ll never forget the night he won against @entity104 in @entity105 – he proved there and then what he can do			0
@entity80 won the @entity71 world welterweight title when he beat @entity104 in @entity109 in august @entity80 said he was the ' victim of an unprovoked attack ' when he was stabbed on holiday last september but is ready for his big homecoming in @entity82 on march 28 but no opponent has been booked as yet @entity114 says it 's time for @entity88 ( right , punching @entity116 ) to step up and take the @entity80 fight @entity80 has been sharp and fast in training and he ’s also been a keen observer of all that goes on around him in the division			1
i can understand why @entity88 has pushed so hard to get a @entity122 fight – if he lost that fight he could brush it off			1
if he lost to @entity125 , where does he go from there ? it also looks like the deadline @entity88 set @entity129 to accept the fight has passed			1
so what next ? he knows where we are			0
he has so much to lose in fighting @entity80 but is adamant he would win with ease			2
if he truly believes that then this is the fight that would make him more money than any other			2
i offered @entity88 $ 5million to take the fight before @entity80 won a world title			1
with a world title involved , the pot of money for this fight is even bigger			1
if @entity88 truly thinks he could beat @entity125 , then he should step up			0
i would back @entity80 every day of the week to win that fight			2
this year is going to be a big year for him and @entity88 wants the lion share of the pot - we are more than happy to have a 60 - 40 or 70 - 30 winner - takes - all deal			1
in fact , how about winner takes all ? it ’s big balls time			1
i caught up with @entity157 ’s win against @entity158 for the @entity160 world heavyweight title			2
i ’m pleased for @entity157			0
he ’s a character and a dangerous heavyweight , which is what the @entity164 heavyweight scene has lacked			0
he also proved his durability and now he has some proper options in front of him , including a rematch with @entity170 , a unification with @entity172 or a fight with @entity175 ’s @entity174			0
that would be a fun event			0
@entity114 caught up with @entity157 ’s win against @entity158 for the @entity160 world heavyweight title @entity157 also proved his durability and now has some options in front of him , including a rematch with @entity170 needless to say , we are keeping an eye on what is going on because down the line it will be of interest to our own man , @entity185 , who is well ranked with the @entity160			1
he ’s had a setback after picking up a stress fracture in his back , but he will be back out on april 4 in @entity189 and i can reveal here that he will also fight on april 25 at the @entity192 , hopefully against @entity193 , who he was meant to fight this month before he injured his back			1
after that we will look to put him in a big fight at the back end of the summer and then @entity185 will be knocking on the door for one of the world titles at the end of the year			1
@entity202 is on the mend and we are looking at his options			0
it is a long road back and hard not to think that he should be preparing for his world - title shot right now			2
i am delighted for @entity207 to be getting a shot in @entity210 ’s place against @entity211 for the @entity213 world lightweight title			2
@entity214 is a good guy			0
our options thereafter might be a shot at @entity214 , if he wins , but we are also keeping an eye on the @entity221 belt			0
@entity222 , the @entity221 champion , is likely to move up a weight , and we ’d be tempted by a fight against @entity225 for the title in the summer			1
i think that can be made			0
@entity202 is on the mend and @entity229 are looking at the @entity232 boxer 's options @entity207 to be getting a shot in @entity235 ’s place against @entity211 for the @entity213 world lightweight title i caught up with @entity122 recently and asked him about @entity237 but as ever he was not giving much away			1
but it sounds like this fight is closer than ever to happening			0
i gather a lot of the details are in place and that it is down to the tv networks to reach an agreement – that ’s not a small factor in this sport			0
i believe it ’s 50 - 50 it will go ahead and i think it will be a two - fight plan , with one in may and the other in september			1
@entity122 's super-fight against @entity237 is closer than ever to happening @entity237 has set @entity122 a deadline of the end of this month to agree terms on the bout the fact that @entity260 ’s fight with @entity261 is off might complicate things as he is someone @entity122 would want to fight			1
but my hope , like everyone else ’s , is that the fight with @entity237 will finally happen			1
do n’t be surprised if @entity266 wins the race though			0
it might be a couple of years too late for some but it will break every record that has ever been set in boxing			0
it will be an amazing clash of skill versus work rate and speed			0
i think @entity122 would edge it but it would be very close .			2

@entity1 will return in the summer and fight @entity277 , @entity14 or maybe even @entity15
money will determine his route this year
it ’s ' big balls ' time for @entity88 - how does a winner takes all against @entity80 sound ?
@entity185 will go on april 25 show at @entity192 , probably against @entity193
@entity202 will consider @entity221 route to world title after head injury
@entity122 - @entity237 will be a two - fight special - and @entity129 will edge it
