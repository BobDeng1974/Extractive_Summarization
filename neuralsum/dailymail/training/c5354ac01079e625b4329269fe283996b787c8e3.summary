health officials are urging people suffering winter vomiting bug to stay at home rather than visiting @entity4 or their gp patients with the winter vomiting bug are being urged to stay at home as it already rife in some hospitals			1
figures show there were 18 outbreaks in hospitals last month with nearly 200 patients and staff struck down			1
although this is no higher compared to previous years , officials warn that it is highly contagious and unpredictable @entity20 – the agency responsible for preventing illness – is urging patients with symptoms not to visit their gp or @entity4			1
the virus causes sudden vomiting , diarrhoea , headaches and a temperature that normally go away by themselves between 24 and 48 hours			0
yet it can be very serious for the elderly who are already very ill in hospital and lead to severe dehydration and death			0
@entity35 , an expert in norovirus at @entity20 said : ‘ october usually marks the start of the norovirus season and the bulk of cases will occur between now and april next year			2
‘ no two norovirus seasons are the same and there is no way of predicting how busy a season will be			0
what we do know is that many people will be affected across the country and they will probably feel very unwell for a couple of days but will get better			2
‘ for patients already ill in hospital , this virus could cause further health complications , making it vital to prevent introducing the virus into the hospital environment			2
‘ we strongly urge anyone affected to stay at home and to telephone @entity59 for advice			0
’ figures for last month show there were 18 outbreaks at hospital – most of which led towards being closed – with 130 patients and 57 staff affected			1
this is slightly lower compared to last year and significantly down on 2012 when a new strain of the virus caused far higher rates than normal			0
there is no treatment and patients are advised to drink plenty of water and rehydration drinks such as @entity79 sachets			1
although it is far commoner in the colder months , the virus is prevalent all year round and is often caught by eating oysters , where it lives			0
but each winter it puts the @entity59 under huge strain because hospitals have to close off wards to prevent the spread which limits the numbers of patients that can be admitted			2
staff must then have to find space elsewhere in the hospital for all those patients while the ward is thoroughly cleaned			0
the winter vomiting bug - also known as norovirus - is highly contagious and can be very serious for the elderly who are already very ill in hospital and lead to severe dehydration and death			1
