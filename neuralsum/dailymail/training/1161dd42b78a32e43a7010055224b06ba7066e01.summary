by @entity0 and @entity1 a teen stowaway who traveled from @entity4 to @entity5 in the wheel well of a passenger jet was actually captured by surveillance cameras as he crept across the tarmac and onto the plane , it has emerged , but no one saw the footage			1
the 16 - year - old successfully slipped past layers of security early sunday morning at @entity17 but no one noticed the security breach until the plane — and the boy — landed in @entity5			1
the startling failure made it clear that a determined person can still get into a supposedly safe area and sneak onto a plane			1
video surveillance can help catch trespassers			2
some airports use not just human eyes watching video screens , but also technology that can be programmed to sound an alert when a camera captures something potentially suspicious			0
@entity37 journey : the above graphic shows a @entity39 767 and a map of the route taken by the teenage stowaway security : a teenage boy , seen sitting on a stretcher center , was spotted on security cameras at @entity17 , @entity47 , was the breach was n't picked up until he landed in @entity49 but just because something is caught on camera does n't mean it will make an impression			1
despite great promise , ' sometimes the actual results are quite underwhelming when it gets to the real world , where people are fatigued , people are preoccupied , ' said @entity60 , an airport security expert at @entity61 in @entity62			2
' there 's no way to guarantee security , even if you had one person per video screen			1
' there were no obvious efforts monday to increase security or the police presence at airports in @entity4 or @entity49			1
in @entity4 , airport officials said they were reviewing how the boy slipped through security that includes video surveillance , @entity79 shepherds and @entity81 - riding police officers			1
while each of those measures can work for certain situations , ' the problem is that each layer has its own error factor , ' @entity60 said			0
nobody monitoring security cameras throughout the 1,050 - acre airport saw anyone approaching the @entity39 767 until they reviewed the footage after the boy was discovered in @entity5 , @entity4 airport spokeswoman @entity88 said			1
the airport , in the heart of @entity96 , is surrounded by fences , although many sections do not have barbed wire and could easily be scaled			0
departures : people make their way into @entity103 at @entity17 near the @entity105 gates monday breach : a 15 - year - old boy on sunday scrambled over an airport fence , crossed a tarmac and climbed into a jetliner 's wheel well , then flew for five freezing hours to @entity5 on a misadventure that forced authorities to take a hard look at the security systems @entity88 said the boy went onto the tarmac when it was still dark			1
the flight took off at about 8 a.m. @entity120 , about 90 minutes after sunrise			0
the boy was knocked out most of the 5 1/2 - hour flight and did n't regain consciousness until an hour after the plane landed in @entity5 , @entity123 spokesman @entity122 said			1
when he came to , he climbed out of the wheel well and was immediately seen by @entity49 airport personnel , @entity122 said			0
surveillance video at @entity132 showed the boy getting out of the wheel well after landing , transportation officials in @entity5 said			1
the video was not released because of the ongoing investigation			0
the boy was not charged with a crime , @entity122 said			2
while the @entity140 oversees checkpoint security inside airport terminals , airport perimeters are policed by local authorities and federal law @entity146 police were working with the @entity123 and @entity140 to review security			2
memory loss : @entity123 spokesman @entity122 in @entity150 said the teen did not remember the flight from @entity4 @entity4 police said they will forward the findings of their investigation to the district attorney , who can decide whether to file criminal charges in @entity47			1
@entity159 spokesman @entity158 said the county was not involved with the incident or investigation because the state runs the airports			0
the @entity165 said they did n't plan to investigate further after turning the boy over to state human services , where officials were working to reunite the boy with his family			2
@entity171 , a former head of security for the @entity174 airline @entity175 who now runs his own firm , @entity176 , said the breach shows that @entity179 airport security still has weaknesses , despite billions of dollars invested			2
' shame on us for doing such a terrible job , ' he said			0
' perimeters are not well protected			0
we see it again and again			0
' @entity179 representative @entity185 , a @entity186 from @entity47 , who serves on the @entity187 , said on @entity188 that the incident demonstrates vulnerabilities that need to be addressed			0
the @entity191 says about one - quarter of the 105 stowaways who have sneaked aboard flights worldwide since 1947 have survived			0
some wheel - well stowaways survived deadly cold and a lack of oxygen because their breathing , heart rate and brain activity slow down .			0
