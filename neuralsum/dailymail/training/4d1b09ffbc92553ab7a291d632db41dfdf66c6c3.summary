an image taken by astronauts aboard the @entity2 has revealed remnants of war from space			1
in the remarkable image , land fortifications and systems of gun emplacements from the @entity4 can clearly be seen			1
the photograph reveals fortifications along a 12 - mile ( 20km ) stretch of the @entity15 - @entity14 border , near the coast of the @entity17			1
in the image @entity14 is at the top right , the border between the countries is the line below the blue dots and @entity15 is to the south the snapshot , captured by an astronaut during @entity31 on 7 november 2014 , was first thought to show a series of oil - pad installations			1
but on closer inspection , the @entity2 team realised that the strange formations aligned along the international boundary were in fact military fortifications			1
the lofty vantage point of the @entity2 has given it access to many scenes of conflict since its permanent habitation began in 2000			1
for instance , astronauts watched on in horror when they saw the terror attacks in @entity49 on sept 11 , 2001			0
poignant footage from space showed smoke rising from @entity49 's @entity53 , moments after two planes smashed into them in the terror attack which killed thousands of people			0
and in 2008 , cosmonaut @entity58 used an 800mm telephoto lens to take images of the @entity62 region shortly after @entity64 forces invaded @entity65			2
systems of large curved earthworks , circular gun emplacements , and straight connecting roads run parallel to the international border			1
this region of oil refining and exporting was the centre of numerous military actions during the war in the 1980s , especially during the defence of the southern city of @entity78			1
images and views like this are not altogether rare for astronauts aboard the @entity2 in july 2014 , for example , the world watched on in horror as the conflict between @entity87 and @entity88 escalated - and its devastating impact reached space			1
looking down from his perch on the @entity2 260 miles ( 415km ) above @entity93 , astronaut @entity91 was able to see rockets lighting up the troubled area			2
@entity91 tweeted an image of the horrifying scenes describing it as his ‘ saddest photo yet ’			2
the image shows @entity101 near the centre with the city lights of @entity104 seen towards the centre left			1
the @entity88 runs along the coast to the far left of the photo			0
disturbingly , many of the explosions are seen in the densely populated regions			0
on 10 november , three days after the @entity15 - @entity14 image was taken , three of the six members on the @entity114 , @entity116 @entity115 and @entity117 @entity91 - returned to @entity93			1
during their time aboard the station , the crew participated in research focusing on @entity93 remote sensing , advanced manufacturing , and studies of bone and muscle physiology			2
they set a milestone for station science by completing a record 82 hours of research in a single week in july			0
a key research focus during their mission , @entity31 , was human health management for long duration space travel , as @entity135 and @entity136 prepare for two crew members to spend one year aboard the space station in march 2015			2
the crew welcomed five cargo spacecraft during its time aboard the orbiting laboratory			2
two @entity64 @entity143 cargo vehicles docked to the station , bringing tons of supplies in july and october			0
the fifth and final @entity147 ( @entity148 ) , dubbed the @entity149 after the @entity151 physicist who is considered the father of the @entity153 , launched to the station in july			0
the patterns were spotted near @entity78 at the border between @entity15 and @entity14 ( shown ) , a remnant of the war in the 1980s the image was snapped by an astronaut on the @entity2 ( shown ) during @entity31 on 7 november 2014			1
three days later three of the six members on the @entity114 , @entity116 @entity115 and @entity117 @entity91 - returned to @entity93 an @entity15 soldier with an assault rifle at the @entity164 in @entity14 in september 1980			1
@entity165 broke out between @entity14 and @entity15 in 1980 and lasted until 1988 following disputes over border disagreements @entity115 and @entity91 ventured outside the confines of the space station for a planned spacewalk to relocate a failed pump module and configure the station for upcoming additions			1
@entity115 completed a second spacewalk with fellow @entity135 astronaut @entity175			0
@entity176 also conducted one spacewalk during @entity31			0
in addition to being a scientific research platform , the space station also serves as a test bed to demonstrate new technology			0
the first 3 - d printer to be tested in space arrived at the station during @entity31			2
it will be the first step toward establishing an on - demand machine shop in space , which is a critical enabling component for deep space crewed missions and in - space manufacturing			0
a new @entity93 monitoring instrument called @entity193 also was installed and activated on the station during the crew ’s time in orbit			0
@entity193 will measure @entity93 's ocean surface wind speed and direction , essential measurements used in weather prediction			0
many other conflicts have been seen by astronauts from space			0
here , looking down from his perch 260 miles ( 415km ) above @entity93 , astronaut @entity91 was able to see rockets lighting up the area as the conflict between @entity87 and @entity88 escalated in july 2014 saving @entity209 : aerial views , such as this one taken above @entity211 , in may 2014 , were used to monitor the progress of wildfires			0

an image taken aboard the @entity2 has revealed remnants of war at a border
the image shows the @entity14 - @entity15 border near the @entity17 and the lasting effects of it
the @entity4 raged from 1980 to 1988 , but decades later its remnants are still *visible*
in the image fortifications and gun emplacements can be seen like ' drawings ' on the ground
