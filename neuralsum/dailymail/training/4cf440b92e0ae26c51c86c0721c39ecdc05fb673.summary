former @entity1 midfielder @entity0 has revealed he is worried that rivals @entity2 might now be leading the way when it comes to player recruitment in the local area			1
the retired star believes local kids would have done anything to sign for @entity1 when he was a young boy , but the pendulum has now swung to the blue half of @entity12			1
@entity0 , writing in his column for the @entity15 , said : ' when i was a kid , it was the case among the lads i played football with that if @entity1 wanted to sign you then joining @entity2 was not even a consideration			1
video has @entity0 still got it ? scroll down to find out @entity0 , working as a pundit , believes @entity2 now have the ability to attract the top young stars ' @entity1 did not have to persuade or offer inducements			1
we would have walked there ourselves			0
' thirty years on , and the picture in @entity12 is very different and , as a @entity1 fan , it worries me			0
' trying to look at it from a neutral perspective i have to say that what @entity2 have achieved is impressive and their impact on the youth scene in @entity12 began long before the opening of their @entity39 this week			0
' former @entity1 star @entity0 was at the club when they signed a young @entity42 in 2004 @entity0 claims players such as @entity44 ( left ) and @entity45 are just stop - gaps in their defence @entity0 has also questioned whether the likes of @entity45 and @entity44 will be at @entity1 in the long run of if they are just stop - gaps			1
' the @entity50 is just one way of taking the temperature of a club â€™s academy			0
@entity1 have a fantastic history in producing players and there will always be boys who will want to come to the club			0
' the issue is whether they are good enough for the first team			0
some of the current lads who have been promoted , such as @entity45 and @entity44 , have benefited from an injury crisis but will they be there in the long term ? @entity67 clearly has a chance of making the grade			2
' @entity0 sees @entity2 's new academy having a strong impact on the youth football scene in the city			2

@entity0 believes @entity2 are capable of enticing young stars to the club over @entity1
@entity0 believes ' kids would have walked ' to @entity1 when he was younger
he also questions @entity45 and @entity44 as @entity1 - *quality*
