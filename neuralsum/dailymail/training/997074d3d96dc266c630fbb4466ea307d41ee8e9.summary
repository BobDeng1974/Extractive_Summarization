they mostly occur because of erosion or underground water that gathers naturally or due to man - made activities			0
when this water dissolves the foundation beneath the surface layer , spaces and caverns develop underground			1
@entity343 , carbonate rock , and salt beds are particular vulnerable to this erosion			0
meanwhile , the top layer of @entity346 usually stays intact			0
when the dissolving area beneath the surface becomes too large , the surface suddenly gives way			0
according to the @entity329 , @entity3 , @entity321 , @entity322 , @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity325 , and @entity326 are the states most affected by sinkholes			1

groundwater pumping and construction are the most likely culprits			0
they can also occur when water drainage systems are changed			0
