under controversial @entity13 rules , bereaved wives who sacrificed their careers because of their husband 's work in the @entity11 are being stripped of as much as £ 10,000 a year if they enter new relationships			1
furious campaigners say it is ' obscene ' to force a widow to forego the retirement income if she remarries or cohabits with a new partner			1
' entitlement ' : army wives , such as the women pictured here at the start of the @entity24 , risk losing their pensions should their husbands die and they remarry ministers have said the @entity27 will not change the law to treat all widows equally			1
their stance has led to claims the government is breaking the @entity33 , which @entity34 enshrined in law to set out the nation 's duty of care to military personnel , veterans and their families			0
@entity42 , 64 , from @entity43 , said that she felt betrayed by the @entity4 for seizing her £ 900 monthly military pension after she found a new partner			2
mrs @entity42 , who followed lieutenant - colonel @entity46 on postings around the globe before he died from a heart attack in 2006 , said the loss of income had left her stressed and facing hardship			0
she said : ' we are not asking for handouts , just for our rightful entitlement			0
my faith in the army which my husband revered has gone			0
' i gave my time , and my energy to an institution @entity63 believed in			0
' he thought he had done the best thing for us			0
i do not feel sorry for myself , i just feel angry now			0
my years as an @entity68 amount to nothing			0

experts predict more than 1,000 face losing their income this year as bureaucrats launch a crackdown			2
on average widows forfeit around £ 3,000 a year			1
' @entity80 is gone ' : one widow affected by the rule said she had lost faith in the @entity84 , which her dead husband ' revered ' the rule applies to the old @entity11 pension scheme and states that if a widow finds new love they will forfeit their retirement pot. the rule does not apply to widows of troops killed on duty			1
the scheme was replaced in 2005 by a newer one which allows widows to keep their income if they remarry			1
air marshal sir @entity100 , chairman of the @entity101 , said : ' many women have sacrificed their own careers to follow their husband 's work with the @entity11 , contributing to their husbands ' pensions in loyalty and devotion to spouse and country			2

' they have truly earned a share in their husband 's pension and to argue otherwise is deeply insulting			0

no change : defence minister @entity133 said that the pensions rules will not be changed due to the financial implications ' a serviceman who has built up a pension entitlement expects it to be passed to their spouse when they die			1
' a widow who has made a considerable sacrifice should not be placed in the dreadful situation of having to decide whether to remarry or keep their pension			2
' some widows decide to secretly cohabit without telling the authorities so that they can keep their income , even though they risk being prosecuted for fraud			1
last year @entity151 , 48 , the widow of a @entity153 diver was jailed after admitting pocketing her @entity11 pension while living with , and then marrying , another man			0
defence minister @entity133 said : ' it has long been the policy of successive governments that changes or improvement to public sector pension schemes should not be applied retrospectively			1
