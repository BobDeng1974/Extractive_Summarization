@entity0 has amazingly escaped an @entity2 charge following his violent confrontation with @entity5 midfielder @entity4			1
the @entity7 defender dodged a ban despite tv footage showing @entity0 wrapping his arm around @entity4 ’s throat and choking him			1
it also appeared to show @entity0 move his head in the direction of @entity4			2
but a three - man panel of former referees decided @entity0 ’s behaviour was not worthy of a red card , meaning he has escaped retrospective action and a possible three - match suspension			2
the @entity2 also looked into suggestions that @entity0 had bitten @entity4 on the shoulder during the incident , a claim the @entity50 vehemently denies			1
but after discussions with @entity5 on thursday , the @entity2 decided there were no grounds to take that allegation further			0
but both clubs have been charged with failing to control their players after the clash that marred @entity7 ’s 1 - 0 win			1
and despite the escape for @entity0 , @entity7 are believed to be unhappy at being charged at all			2
@entity5 boss @entity60 said @entity0 should have been sent off but the @entity2 have chosen to take a lenient approach , as they did when @entity63 boss @entity62 went unpunished for putting his hands round the neck of @entity67 ’s @entity66 last saturday			2
@entity0 looks towards @entity4 as the melee takes place in the background on wednesday evening @entity0 throws his head towards @entity4 but escaped punishment on the night at @entity30 in a statement on their website the @entity2 confirmed : ‘ @entity0 will not face any further action in relation to an incident involving @entity5 ’s @entity4			1

he 'll get away with it for me			0
@entity109 : i do n't think it was worth a red card , @entity113 , the referee did n't see the incident - it 's up to the law makers now			0
@entity116 : i 've seen a lot worse but can you grab someone around the throat and do that ? if the referee sees the movement towards @entity4 it 's a red for me			0
@entity125 : it 's a yellow for me - nothing more			0
@entity127 : it 's not clear cut enough for the @entity2 to ban him for three games , for me			0
