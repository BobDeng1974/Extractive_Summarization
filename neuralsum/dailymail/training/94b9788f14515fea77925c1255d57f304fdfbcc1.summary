reality stars have recorded a @entity2 charity cover of ' @entity2 ' by @entity3 and @entity4 last updated at 7:31 am on 9th november 2011 they are no strangers to an old fashioned feud , with plenty of experience from their own constant onscreen bickering			1
so the cast of @entity12 is @entity13 knew exactly how to issue a low blow to their current nemesis , footballer @entity15 , during an ongoing war of words on @entity18			1
taking a break from recording their @entity2 charity single in @entity23 this afternoon , the cast posed for a rude photo mocking the 29 - year - old sportsman			1
' @entity26 ' : the cast of @entity28 mocked footballer @entity15 today by posting this picture on @entity18 while the reality stars are almost always engaged in some argument at any one time within their group , they banded together yesterday to take on the footballer after he launched a scathing attack on them			1
the cast , including @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , held their pinky fingers up for the camera			1
@entity46 went one further , gesturing with his middle finger , while @entity48 held a sign that read ' @entity51 ( slang for jealous ) @entity15			1
' members of the group then posted the snap on @entity18			1
boys will be boys : @entity15 took a break from the feud he sparked on @entity18 on monday night to go paintballing the move only reignited @entity15 's rant last night , with the @entity62 player targeting other celebrities and fans who waded into the fight to support the @entity28 gang			1
' isnt it quite obsurd ( sic ) that all these z - listers stick up for each other regardless of the show their on ? must think it 'll get them a @entity74 advert , ' he wrote			1
after lashing out at a number of @entity18 users , he ended his tirade with : ' right people time to leave u. take the high ground , there 's a z - list lynch mob outside burning pitchfolks with @entity85 t shirts on			1
' charity single : the cast spent the day recording a cover of @entity2 meanwhile , the @entity28 cast got back to work on their charity single , filming the video in a @entity23 studio			1
@entity95 announced the news on @entity18			1
he wrote yesterday : ' the only way is @entity13 have officially recorded a @entity98 covering @entity99 's “ @entity2 ” ! @entity100 be so funny # @entity101 ! ! ! ! ! ' the reality stars were dressed up in red , white and gold to perform the hit song , with crooner @entity95 as their leader			1
break : @entity108 and @entity42 were spotted dressed to the nines outside the studio during a break from recording the single long day : @entity26 was seen arriving at the studios in casual wear , while co-star @entity46 was pictured leaving hours later they were n't letting the attack from @entity15 dampen their holiday spirit as they belted out the hit song , which will be released on the charts in time for @entity2			1
the war of words began last night shortly after @entity15 attended the @entity123 : @entity125 launch party along with several members of the @entity28 gang			1
rather than keep to himself and enjoy a night off from the day job , @entity15 , who does n't exactly have the best reputation himself , launched a barrage of digs in their direction			1
party season : @entity135 wore a red satin frock and leopard heels , while @entity48 was lovely as ever in a white dress but , rather cowardly , he did n't actually put them down to their face - but decided to rant about them on his @entity18 page instead			2
he started by noting that his fellow guests were a bunch of ' strange z - list celebs ' and added : ' just for the record the @entity28 helmets were there , all of them together			2
' but @entity28 's @entity95 was having none of it and responded : ' only person there that everyone looked down on is u. should we beat our @entity28 cast mates up & go down for you to like us ! ? mug ! ' @entity15 replied : ' leave it u stonehenge teeth			2
cheeky man giving it bigguns , leave it large undies			2
' uncalled for : @entity15 attended the launch of @entity123 : @entity125 in @entity23 last night where he saw the @entity28 stars , including @entity95 , which sparked his scathing @entity18 attack @entity95 's best friend and fellow @entity28 star @entity171 was n't at the computer game launch as he had dinner plans with his family			1
but that did n't stop him getting involved as he took to his @entity18 page to defend his friend and put @entity179 in his place			2
he wrote : ' @entity26 where can i get ur hair cut ? also u no that arg wants he 's teeth done so thanks 4 watching the show ! ! ' @entity15 replied : ' same place u get them speedo 's			2
@entity193 sister still collecting footballers like panini stickers ? ? ? ' did n't want to say it to their face ? @entity15 's @entity18 feed shows some of the insults directed at @entity201 and @entity171 online rant : @entity15 's digs continued long after @entity171 , @entity13 and @entity95 signed off @entity171 laughed it off and wrote , ' is that all you got haha			2
good night silly nuts ' , but @entity15 got angry and decided to insult @entity171 's grandmother instead , telling him : ' nanny pat same knashers as that white horse u rode in on			2
' still determined not to rise to it , @entity171 concluded : ' haha u even know the white horse i rode in on			0
@ joey7barton # @entity217 fan ! last message i waste on u , u complete lunch			0
' @entity38 also decided to tell @entity15 off and wrote on his @entity18 page , ' go to bed mate , it 's 1 in the morning ' , but @entity15 told him : ' do n't u start			0
go and tell that bird u love her and get a massive " nice guy " jog on			0
' fighting back : @entity171 was n't going to let @entity15 insult his friends and family - but also rose above it by trying to laugh it off @entity171 and @entity26 then signed off the row and refused to get drawn into it further but @entity15 would not let it lie and carried on making nasty remarks about the cast and the show			0
he wrote : ' @entity28 firm do n't mess with big boys , u and ur shallow , fake , pretentious lifestyles			0
in a year u 'll be opening sh * * * y poundshops if ur lucky			0
' fyi - @entity28 retards ...			0
. " @entity246 " google it if ur struggling ... ... off to bed , keep me updated people with the @entity251 , all thats wrong with the world that mob , i 'll take great pleasure in abusing them			0
' you tell him , @entity95 ! the crooner tried to put @entity15 in his place on his @entity18 page award - winning : @entity95 points out that @entity28 has won a prestigious gong one step further : @entity95 then posted a picture poking fun at @entity15 's hairstyle @entity95 could n't resist one last attempt to shut @entity15 up before signing off and wrote : ' someone looks like they 've watched the show more then we have ! night # @entity28 fans ! wan na put us down ? all we need to say is one word			0
. @entity272 ! ' but that wound @entity15 up even further , and he added : ' told u to leave did n't i , right fatty now ur fair game			0
ca n't believe ur giving it with them teeth like a burnt down fence			0
' i actually despise the whole of that firm , mentally deficient , turn up at the opening of an envelope , fame hungry , prized b * * * bags			0
' he would n't let it lie : @entity15 kept digging at the @entity28 gang long after he left the party @entity15 , who has been described as one of the dirtiest players in the @entity295 , has twice been convicted of violence , the first in may 2008 when he was sentenced to six months ' imprisonment for common assault and affray after he was caught on @entity301 in @entity302 knocking a man to the ground before straddling him and punching him four or five times as his cousin threw food at the victim			0
minutes later @entity15 attacked a 16 - year - old boy and left him with broken teeth and served 77 days of the prison term			0
in july 2008 , he was given a four month suspended sentence after he pleaded guilty to a violent attack on @entity315 teammate @entity314 during a row at the club 's training ground			0
this effectively finished his career at the club where , four years earlier , he stubbed a lit cigar out on the eye of teammate and youth player @entity325 and was fined six weeks wages , which amounted to about £ 60,000			0
thug : @entity15 is known for his violent outbursts on the pitch too and is seen here squaring up to @entity331 's @entity330 during one of his last games for @entity334 before he moved to @entity62 this summer			0
