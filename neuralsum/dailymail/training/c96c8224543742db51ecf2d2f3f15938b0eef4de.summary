@entity1 dreams would be out of the question if president @entity3 had a son			1
as part of a profile for @entity7 , @entity3 is asked if he might feel ambivalent watching professional football , given recent headlines about concussions and health problems affecting players			1
the president 's response was clear			2
' i would not let my son play pro football , ' he said			0
' but , i mean , you wrote a lot about boxing , right ? we ’re sort of in the same realm			2
' though president @entity3 poses for photos with members of the 1972 @entity27 including head coach @entity28 ( r ) , quarterback @entity29 ( @entity30 ) in this august photo , he recently said ' i would not let my son play pro football ' president @entity3 ( @entity30 ) , seen here holding up a jersey given to him by head coach @entity34 ( r ) after welcoming members of the @entity37 champion @entity38 , said @entity1 players ' know what they 're doing ' when it comes to the risks of the sport @entity3 also said that professional football players are aware of the game 's much - publicized risks			1
' at this point , there ’s a little bit of caveat emptor , ' he went on			0
' these guys , they know what they ’re doing			0
they know what they ’re buying into			0
it is no longer a secret			0
it ’s sort of the feeling i have about smokers , you know ? ' the sentiments expressed in the profile are similar to ones @entity3 gave to @entity65 in january 2013 ' i 'm a big football fan , but i have to tell you if i had a son , i 'd have to think long and hard before i let him play football , ' he said			1
' and i think that those of us who love the sport are going to have to wrestle with the fact that it will probably change gradually to try to reduce some of the violence			0
in some cases , that may make it a little bit less exciting , but it will be a whole lot better for the players , and those of us who are fans maybe wo n't have to examine our consciences quite as much			2
' seen here with members of the @entity89 football team in 2013 , @entity3 said last year ' i tend to be more worried about college players than @entity1 players in the sense that the @entity1 players have a union , they 're grown men , they can make some of these decisions on their own ' regarding football 's risks @entity3 also said at the time he was more concerned about college players as opposed to those in the @entity1			1
' i tend to be more worried about college players than @entity1 players in the sense that the @entity1 players have a union , they 're grown men , they can make some of these decisions on their own , and most of them are well - compensated for the violence they do to their bodies , ' he said			1
' you read some of these stories about college players who undergo some of these same problems with concussions and so forth and then have nothing to fall back on			0
that 's something that i 'd like to see the @entity117 think about			0
' unlike @entity3 , @entity119 49ers coach @entity120 last year said his son @entity121 will be allowed to play the sport when he is old enough , @entity118 reports			2
' i have a 4 - month old , almost 5 - month old son , @entity123 , and if president @entity3 feels that way , then there will be a little bit less competition for @entity123 when he gets old , ' he said			1
last year @entity3 ( here with the @entity89 team in 2013 ) said he thought football ' will probably change gradually to try to reduce some of the violence '			1

compared football 's risks to those of boxing
said @entity1 players ' know what they ’re doing ' regarding *physical* risks , comparing them to smokers
similar to *statements* given in 2013 , when @entity3 said ' @entity1 players can make some of these decisions on their own ' and most are ' well - compensated for the violence they do to their bodies
