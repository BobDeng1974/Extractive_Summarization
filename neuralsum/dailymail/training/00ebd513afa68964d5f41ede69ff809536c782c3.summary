the banning of the rull veil in @entity3 ignited a fierce debate over the value of religious freedom against social cohesion it is a typically forthright view from a woman of strong opinions who has already taken a far more prominent role than her predecessor , @entity82 , who was practically invisible during the 13 - year rule of her husband @entity84			1
@entity84 came to power after a @entity87 - led coalition toppled the hardline @entity89 government that banned women from leaving their homes without male guardians			2

@entity36 returned to @entity122 in 2002 when her husband , then a successful @entity145 economist , returned home as the country 's finance minister			1
though immersed in the affairs of her adopted country , she is a self - professed francophile who recalls vividly her time in @entity43 during the student uprising of 1968			0
