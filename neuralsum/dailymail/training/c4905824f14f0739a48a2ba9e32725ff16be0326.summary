by @entity0 published : 22:38 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 13:10 est , 25 october 2012 happy family : @entity2 a six - year - old girl delivered her own sister when she was woken up by her mother who had gone into labour on the bathroom floor at home - thanks to watching an episode of @entity16 drama @entity14			1
@entity2 calmly talked her mother @entity3 , 28 , through the sudden birth after her waters broke in @entity19 , @entity20 - while her father @entity21 , 33 , was calling 999			1
she helped her panicking mother with her breathing , encouraging her to push , fetched her clean towels and even made sure the umbilical cord was not wrapped around the baby ’s head			1
@entity2 leapt into action in july after recalling an episode of casualty when a woman suddenly went into labour			2
after 12 minutes of pushing , 6lbs 8oz baby @entity5 had been delivered			0
the schoolgirl said : ‘ i had to keep mummy calm			0
i did n’t want the cord to be wrapped around her neck because she might have died and i held her when she was born to keep her safe			2
‘ i do n’t know how i knew about it but i do watch @entity14 and like it a lot			0
my friends at school all said “ wow ” and my teacher was really impressed with me			1
' when two ambulances arrived , paramedics were stunned to find @entity2 - who wants to be a doctor when she is older - holding her newborn sister after carefully wrapping her in a towel			2
shop assistant mrs @entity2 said yesterday : ‘ i was so impressed with @entity2			1
she was remarkably cool and collected for a six - year - old			0
' she had gone to bed but woke up when i started screaming			0
‘ she came in and was like “ mummy are you okay ? ” and said “ i can see the head ”			0
she was keeping me calm and telling me where to put my hands and telling me to keep breathing			0
sisters : the schoolgirl helped her panicking mother with her breathing , encouraging her to push , fetched her clean towels and even made sure the umbilical cord was not wrapped round the baby 's head ‘ as soon as she was born she got a towel and it was like she knew what to do - i did n’t say anything to her			1
@entity2 had her wrapped up and made sure the cord was n’t wrapped around her neck			1
‘ my husband was downstairs on the phone for 12 minutes and a few minutes after she was born two ambulances turned up			0
they were shocked that @entity2 was holding her in towels			1
’ she added that her daughter must have learned how to deliver a baby by watching @entity14 - and when they saw a recent episode where a lady gave birth , @entity2 said : ‘ that ’s your story , mummy			1
’ mrs @entity2 started having contractions every 20 minutes on july 16			2
the next day she went to her chosen birthing centre but was discharged because she was only in the early stages of labour			0
once at home , she said she called her midwife 10 times to say her contractions were stronger and lasting longer - but was told her labour was n’t advanced because she could speak normally			0
team effort : mrs @entity2 is seen left with her two daughters , and right with her newborn baby @entity5 in hospital tv drama : mrs @entity2 said the girl must have learned how to deliver a baby by watching casualty ( file picture ) however at around 9.30pm , mrs @entity2 noticed she was bleeding - but she said the birthing centre told her they would probably discharge her if she came in again			1
' i do n’t know how i knew about it but i do watch @entity14 and like it a lot			0
my friends at school all said “ wow ” and my teacher was really impressed ' @entity2 finally , just before 10pm on july 17 , her waters broke after she went to the toilet			1
her screaming woke up @entity2 - who came to her mother ’s aide as her father went downstairs to call 999			1
the delivery was quick after her waters broke and following an overnight stay in hospital , mother and baby were discharged			2
she is now looking forward to one day telling @entity5 how her older sister helped bring her into the world			0
mr @entity129 , also a shop assistant , missed @entity2 ’s birth too thanks to work obligations			2
mrs @entity2 said : ‘ i had just gave birth to @entity2 and he turned up , he just missed it			2
i do n’t think it really matters to him - he probably would have fainted , like you see men do on the telly			0

@entity2 , of @entity141 , calmly talked mother @entity3 through birth
helped mother with breathing , encouraged her to push and fetched towels
the girl even made sure umbilical cord was *n't* wrapped around baby 's head
@entity2 says her friends said ' wow ' and her teacher was ' really impressed '
