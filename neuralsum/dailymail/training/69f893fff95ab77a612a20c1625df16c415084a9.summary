by @entity0 assisted suicide : rogue trader @entity2 , whose risky investments destroyed @entity4 , has admitted he contemplated paying two men with @entity7 connections to kill him in prison the man who became a symbol of the excess , macho culture and greed of stock market trading has admitted he considered paying a hitman to murder him in prison			1
' rogue trader ' @entity2 , in an interview with @entity18 , spoke of the dark period of his life in a @entity23 cell			1
@entity2 's risk - taking deals led to an £ 827million loss and single - handedly destroyed the centuries - old @entity4			1
a @entity30 schoolboy - turned - @entity28 whizzkid , mr @entity2 's early career was a success and he was promoted within the bank , but things began to unravel when he started making losses while trading in @entity36 and used a secret account to hide them			1
in 1995 he was finally arrested in @entity23 , aged just 28 , after going on the run when his financial mismanagement was discovered and was imprisoned while awaiting extradition to @entity36			0
he was surrounded by arms dealers , sex offenders , drug dealers and , he discovered , @entity46 men with ' connections ' - an ice cream vendor , @entity49 , and a ' well - dressed man ' called @entity51			1
he said : ' it would have cost me £ 10,000 i think			1
' i presumed it would happen in the showers one day , someone would just knife me			0
' shockingly , @entity2 , now 46 and living in @entity58 in @entity59 , had to speak to his wife and father in order for them to negotiate his murder on his behalf			1
he added : ' obviously they cried but you have to deal with the reality of situation			0
' back in @entity36 , he was sentenced to six and a half years in @entity70			0
he was released in 1999 , having been diagnosed with colon cancer , which he survived despite being given a slim chance of pulling through			0
his wife divorced him while he was inside			2
he added that he has no sympathy for rogue traders @entity85 of @entity86 and @entity87 of @entity88 , who lost £ 6.1billion and £ 1.1billion respectively			1
' anything that they 've done and hidden is fraud			0
' i think it 's a macho culture that 's evolved			2
when things go wrong , there 's a certain age group that is usually involved : young men			2
' contrite : @entity2 readily accepts the blame for his actions , although many have criticised the lack of oversight at @entity4 at the time when asked if a rogue trader will ever bring down a bank again , @entity2 replied : ' no doubt about it			1
if you ask anyone in the banking industry , they will say " yes " , but it wo n't be me			0
' @entity2 is also considering a return to the financial sector , although , instead of trading , he wants to set up an organisation to help people financially crippled by the banking crisis			1
he is also a regular guest on the after - dinner and keynote speaking circuit			0
downfall : @entity2 addresses a press conference			1
a film was made about him called @entity125 and starred @entity126 from 1992 , @entity2 at first made large profits for @entity4 in @entity36			2
however , his luck turned and he used one of @entity4 ' error accounts ( accounts used to correct mistakes made in trading ) to hide his losses			0
@entity2 was chief trader while also being responsible for settling his trades , making it much simpler for him to hide his losses			1
by the end of 1992 , the account 's losses exceeded £ 2 million , which hit £ 208 million by the end of 1994			2
a series of risky trades in 1995 pushed the losses up further			0
@entity2 left a note reading ' i 'm sorry ' and fled @entity36 on 23 february			2
the bank was declared insolvent soon after			0
the @entity36 authorities ' report on the collapse was scathingly critical of @entity4 management			0

' rogue trader ' says he met @entity7 - connected men who would do the deed
it would have cost him £ 10,000 as he did not want to do it himself
*amazingly* , he spoke to wife and father about organising the hit for him
@entity2 , now 46 , also *commented* on *current* banking culture in interview
