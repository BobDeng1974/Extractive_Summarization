the shocking testimonies of four women who accuse the late sir @entity2 of sexually abusing them as children can be revealed today			1
the @entity4 has been given an exclusive preview of an explosive 55 - minute @entity7 documentary to be screened on wednesday			1
in exposure : the other side of @entity2 , in which the women , now all middle - aged , offer compelling accounts of how they were groomed by @entity2 for sex when they were teenagers			1
shocking testimonies : four women , now all middle - aged , have offered compelling accounts of how they were groomed by @entity2 , pictured , for sex when they were teenagers in an @entity7 documentary the documentary also features damning contributions from former @entity21 production staff who reveal that the star ’s predatory behaviour with girls as young as 12 was an open secret			1
and a child protection expert who investigated the claims for @entity7 tells the programme he is convinced @entity2 , who died last year , would face arrest if still alive			1
@entity33 - @entity34 , who for 12 years was a detective and child protection officer , spent a year talking to @entity2 ’s former victims			1
he told @entity4 : ‘ they were in awe of an individual who could give them a great number of benefits , and so the abuse could go on and on unchecked			1
the women thought no one would believe them then , and even now they are terrified of the potential backlash from his fans and from his estate			1
but i have no doubt that on the evidence i have gathered , if @entity2 was still alive i would be banging on his door to get him nicked			1
’ ' he was all over me ' : 14 - year - old @entity54 ( pictured with @entity2 on @entity55 in 1979 ) said she was horrified when he intimately cuddled her on the show mr @entity34 was a child protection officer with @entity58 and worked on the prosecution of pop impresario @entity60 on charges of sex with underage boys			1
since leaving the police , he has become a consultant on child protection and fronted the @entity7 documentary to catch a paedophile			1
he said : ‘ early last year i was asked by a contact if i was aware of allegations that had circulated for years about @entity71 and young girls and if i knew of an investigation into a complaint made to @entity76 police in 2007			1
' he put his hand up my skirt			2
there were dozens of times after that			2
when i was 16 it turned into full sex			2
' @entity84 , 15 , @entity55 1968 ‘ when @entity2 died , i began an investigation and was put in contact with several women who alleged they had been abused by him			1
’ he has learned that at least two complaints were made to @entity58 about @entity2 while he was alive , though the force refuses to say whether he was formally interviewed			2
the shocking conclusion of his investigation is that @entity2 , who was the face of @entity55 for three decades as well as @entity94 ’ll fix it , groomed girls as young as 12 for sex			1
@entity2 ’s victims tell strikingly similar stories in the documentary , which is to be screened at 11pm – two hours after the watershed			1
explosive : the documentary claims that @entity2 , who famously presented the first ever @entity55 , gave young girls money and cigarettes in return for ' sexual favours ' until his death at 84 , @entity2 was seen as an outlandish but avuncular star who loved tracksuits and ostentatious jewellery			1
but despite his tireless charity work , he never escaped dark rumours about his lifestyle			2
the @entity7 investigation makes concrete allegations for the first time			1
one woman identified in the programme only as ‘ @entity84 ’ met @entity2 on @entity55 in 1968 when she was 15			1
she says : ‘ he got me into an alcove in his dressing room and pushed me against the wall			2
he put his hand up my skirt			2
' he invited me to his hotel and before i knew it he had me on the bed and was having sex			2
it was repulsive what he was doing to me and other girls			1
' @entity133 , 15 , @entity55 1968 ‘ there were dozens of times after that when i met him			2
he ’d pin me up against a wall , a corridor , wherever he could he ’d grab an opportunity			2
when i was 16 one of these occasions turned into full sex			2
‘ he kept saying he would n’t go the whole way but when i tried to push him off he held me down with his body weight			2
i later discovered he ’d given me a sexually transmitted disease			2
’ she adds : ‘ i was very young and he was a charismatic and powerful personality			2
there was an air about him that he had power and contacts and you did n’t want to mess with him			0
’ another woman , ‘ @entity133 ’ , tells a similar tale of meeting @entity2 on @entity55 in 1968 , also aged 15			0
‘ he invited me to come round to his hotel and before i knew it he had me on the bed and was having sex with me			0

it was all very unemotional on his part			0
i was a teenager and very naive and i blamed myself for what he did			0
’ had he been alive : @entity2 , who died last year , would have faced arrest if still alive , a child protection expert claims on the documentary @entity170 was a young @entity171 - educated @entity21 producer working on radio talk show @entity172 when he first encountered @entity173			1

‘ he told me he had met the girl – who was small and waif - like – on @entity55 the night before			1
she was very young , i ’d say near to 12			0
' i remember the teacher introducing me and saying , " be nice to uncle @entity2 "			0
i was told to sit on his lap and i felt his hand go up my jumper			0
' @entity189 , @entity190 1974 ‘ @entity2 arranged to meet me in a @entity179 hotel called @entity192 , which was a very seedy place off @entity194 , the next day			0
when i called up to his room he told me that he was in bed with the girl i ’d met the night before and he even got her to talk to me on the phone			0
i remember her saying , “ hello mr producer ”			0
i did n’t want to carry on talking			0
‘ i told him he was living incredibly dangerously and he replied , “ no , no , no , i ’m far too valuable to the @entity21 for anything to happen to me ”			0
‘ it appeared to be generally accepted that he was usually in the company of young girls			1
i know it sounds cowardly , but there was the feeling that if i grassed to the top end of the @entity21 then i would have been out			0
’ another @entity21 employee , @entity210 , was a production assistant on tv show @entity211 in 1978 when she encountered @entity2 with a girl she believes was 14			0
former detective @entity213 approached @entity214 to look at interviewed women who say @entity2 sexually abused them ‘ as i walked into his dressing room , he was sitting in a chair with the girl on his knee			0
his left arm was resting on her leg and he was kissing her			0
there was no doubt in my mind it was a sexual advance			1
’ in january it emerged that a probe by @entity228 ’s @entity227 into allegations about @entity2 had been shelved			0
there were suspicions of a cover - up , but @entity227 editor @entity233 told @entity4 it was dropped for editorial reasons			1
‘ we were pursuing a particular angle which we were unable to substantiate , ’ he said			0
@entity237 @entity54 , who does not appear in the @entity7 programme , revealed four years ago that she was horrified when @entity2 intimately cuddled her in 1979 on @entity55 when she was 14			1
she said : ‘ he was all over me			0
i could see my sisters glaring , “ you touch her and we ’ ll kill you ! ” – and they would have done			0
’ in 2007 , @entity58 received complaints that @entity2 had abused pupils at the now defunct @entity246 for girls near @entity248 , for which he did charity work in the @entity250			1
