by @entity0 scientists believe they have found a possible cure for pancreatic cancer - the disease that @entity6 ceo @entity5 died of a cure for pancreatic cancer could be on the horizon , according to researchers			1
scientists at the @entity12 believe they have found a treatment that could eradicate the disease in just one week			1
pancreatic cancer has few symptoms in its early stages and so is usually only diagnosed once it is too advanced to be tackled effectively			2
as a result , it has one of the poorest prognoses of any cancer			0
doctors had struggled to defeat the illness using the body 's own immune system - a method known as immunotherapy			1
but researchers have recently discovered that this is because infected cells coat themselves in a ‘ chemokine protein ’ and form a protective barrier around the tumours			1
now , staff at the @entity37 have finally made a breakthrough that could one day lead to a cure			0
a new drug called @entity42 - also known as @entity42 - could be used to help block the formation of the protein and break down the cancer 's barrier			1
the body 's ‘ t cells ’ - which attack the cancerous cells - are then able to break through and fight the tumour			1
researchers had been testing the drug on mice but now feel it is ready to be tested on humans - with a cure potentially available within the next ten years			1
dr @entity58 , from the research institute , has now claimed the breakthrough could be the first step towards a cure for many forms of the disease			0
he said : ‘ we want to get the clinical trial on humans started up as soon as we can as it was so successful on mice			2
‘ by enabling the body to use its own defences to attack cancer , this approach has the potential to greatly improve treatment of solid tumours			2
‘ the best possible scenario is that it will cause regression to a large proportion against pancreatic cancer			0
experts at the @entity12 say the drug they have created could cure the disease ( pictured ) in just one week - they think it also has the potential to cure other cancers , such as lung and ovarian cancers ‘ and that is not just restricted to pancreatic cancer but would be effective in many forms , including ovarian and lung cancer because they react similarly			1
‘ this could potentially cure cancer , and save all those lives lost each year to the disease			0
’ clinical trials are expected to take place in six months at @entity101 in @entity102			0
pancreatic cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer - related death in the @entity107 and the eighth most common worldwide			2
tumour removal is the most effective treatment , but it is suitable for just one in five patients			0
it affects men and women equally , and is most common in people over the age of 60			0
fewer than 20 per cent of pancreatic cancer patients are currently still alive a year after diagnosis and less than four per cent survive for five years .			0

scientists have found a drug that could eradicate the disease within a week
cancerous cells create a protective barrier around pancreatic tumours
a new drug - @entity42 - could break down this protective barrier
this would allow the body 's immune system to attack the tumour
the drug has successfully cured mice - a human trial will start soon
