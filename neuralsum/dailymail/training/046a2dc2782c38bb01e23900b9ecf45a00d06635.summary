the menopause could be eliminated within 20 years and the process of ageing could be halted or even reversed , a scientist has predicted			1
pioneering stem cell scientist @entity4 said that rapid progress in stem cell and regenerative therapies meant that current age limits on when women can conceive and give birth were likely to vanish			1
he said there was no reason why anti-ageing treatments should not extend to the female reproductive life - span because the ovaries were ‘ just another organ ’			2
‘ we could rejuvenate the ovary by stimulating or replenishing stem cells , we could create a whole new ovary through tissue engineering like an artificial heart , there are all manner of possibilities			1
’ dr @entity4 , a theoretician in the field of gerontology , is co-founder of the @entity37 , which funds research aimed at developing treatments on reversing ageing			1
while regarded by some as a maverick , his research has attracted significant financial backing , including some from @entity45 , the @entity47 investor			2
fertility experts agreed that significant progress had been made towards overcoming some forms of female infertility that were previously completely untreatable			2
older mothers : @entity53 ( left ) gave birth at 47 and @entity55 ( right ) had a child at 42 @entity57 , a reproductive biologist at the @entity58 , told @entity22 that treatments were on the horizon for early menopause			0
she said : ‘ the dogma has been that a woman has a fixed number of eggs , that they ’re formed before birth and there ’s no more once they run out			0
’ work by professor @entity57 ’s group also suggests that primordial follicles - immature female egg cells - taken from the ovaries so young girls undergoing cancer treatments can be successfully matured in culture outside of their body - raising the prospect that their fertility could be preserved			1
there is emerging evidence that the ovary retains an untapped reservoir of immature follicles beyond the menopause that could potentially be exploited in the future to extend the limits of female fertility			0
fertility experts agreed that much progress has been made in overcoming previously untreatable infertility there is even some evidence that the ovaries contain even more primitive egg stem cells - raising the possibility of a limitless supply of eggs			1
but this finding remains controversial and contested within the field			0
professor @entity57 added : ‘ it depends what you mean by eliminate the menopause			0
‘ it would be naive of anyone to think that you might get these cells and just put them in an ovary and expect them to grow			0
there ’s a long way to go and you hesitate to say things that could create false hope			0
’ dr @entity4 has previously claimed that there is no reason why human being should not live to be 1,000 years old			1
speaking ahead of his talk at the @entity122 technology summit in @entity123 this week , dr @entity4 conceded that there was scepticism about his ideas , but remained confident that science would overcome ageing eventually			2
he said : ‘ the industrial revolution changed a lot too , but not many people think it was a bad idea			0

scientist @entity4 says stem cell therapies will eliminate process
possibility of creating whole new ovaries through tissue engineering
eggs could also be taken from young girls with cancer to preserve fertility
*mr* @entity4 has been *heavily* backed financially in his research
