by @entity0 last updated at 1:22 pm on 4th november 2011 a mother who took her seriously - ill baby to an @entity5 walk - in centre was told he was merely teething			1
@entity7 rushed her six - month - old son @entity8 to the centre in @entity10 , @entity11 , after his temperature rose to @entity13 and he refused to eat or drink			1
but she was reassured by medics that he was teething and recommended @entity16			2
just hours later @entity17 turned blue , started fitting and was rushed to hospital where tests revealed that he had contracted bacterial meningitis , which left untreated can cause severe brain damage			1
six month old @entity23 displayed a sky - high temperature but his mother @entity26 was reassured at an @entity5 walk - in centre in @entity10 that he was teething over a five day period at @entity29 the toddler was given urgent treatment , including oxygen and antibiotics , before being allowed to return home with his parents @entity7 , 25 and father @entity35 , 34			1
mother of four @entity26 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , is now angry that doctors failed to spot the serious condition			2
over a five day period at @entity39 was given urgent treatment she said : ' i 'm still so upset because if he did n't start fitting and turning blue i would n't have rang the ambulance - the walk in centre should 've spotted that something was n't right			1
' it was awful - he could n't breathe and he was so dehydrated and looked awful in hospital with all the tubes in his nose and the needles in his arm			1
' the incident occurred after @entity26 , a part time hairdressing student , noticed @entity8 's symptoms and decided to seek medical treatment			0
but unable to get an appointment with her own gp she took him to the @entity60 in @entity10 , @entity11 where a doctor checked him over , misdiagnosed his condition and sent him away			0
@entity26 said : ' i did n't think it was teething because i 've got three kids and i know what teething is			0
yet you assume doctors know best and i took her word for it			0
' if i would have ignored my instinct and just listened to the drop in then he might not have been here today			0
' a nurse said if i had n't seen him having those fits , he could have died			0
' now @entity26 , her gp , and gp practice manager are set to submit a formal complaint to the walk - in service , where a full investigation is underway			2
more serious form of the condition an infection of the meninges ( the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord ) caused by bacteria symptoms usually begin suddenly and rapidly get worse early warning signs can include pain in the muscles , joints or limbs , unusually cold hands and feet , or shivering , pale or blotchy skin and blue lips early symptoms can include a severe headache , fever , nausea , vomiting , feeling generally unwell if you suspect a case of bacterial meningitis , you should phone 999 immediately treatment includes antibiotics , oxygen , intravenous fluids , steroids and other medication to help reduce the inflammation around the brain @entity115 , chief executive of @entity116 , a body which runs the medical centre , said : ' we fully understand the distress the situation must have caused @entity8 's family and while we await a formal complaint i would urge them to get in touch with us so we can fully understand their concerns			1
' our preliminary assessment suggested that the advice given was suitable for the symptoms @entity8 presented with at the time			0
' mother @entity26 , who suffered from septicemia meningitis three years ago , hopes that this will help others spot the signs of meningitis , as the rash - one of the most common signals - was n't present in her or @entity8 's case			1
she added : ' all we want is if someone goes to the drop in and gets sent away and they 're not happy then do n't think there 's anything wrong in asking for a second opinion			0
' in 2008 and 2009 in @entity150 and @entity151 , around 1,166 cases of meningitis were caused by bacteria which is most common in children under five years old .			2

six - month - old had a temperature of @entity13 and refused to eat or drink but was sent away
