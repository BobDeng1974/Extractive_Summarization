scientists have uncovered the genetic mechanism which appeared to have led two @entity3 - infected men to experience a ' spontaneous cure '			1
they say the discovery could lead to new treatments for the disease			0
both men were infected by the human immunodeficiency virus ( @entity3 ) , one of them 30 years ago , but never developed @entity11 symptoms			1
the @entity14 group looked at two ' immune ' individuals , a 57 - year - old man diagnosed @entity3 - positive in 1985 , and a 23 - year - old diagnosed in 2011 , and sequenced their virus genomes			1
a rare group of people -- fewer than one percent of those infected -- are naturally able to rein in viral replication and keep the virus at clinically undetectable levels			1
they are known as ' elite controllers ' , but the mechanism by which they keep the virus at bay remains a mystery			1
the @entity14 group looked at two such individuals , a 57 - year - old man diagnosed @entity3 - positive in 1985 , and a 23 - year - old diagnosed in 2011 , and sequenced their virus genomes			2
though they remained infected , standard tests could not detect the virus in their blood			2
the team found that in both cases , the virus was unable to replicate in immune cells due to mutations in its genetic code			1
the aids - causing virus remained in their immune cells but was inactivated because its genetic code had been altered , the scientists said			1
the change appeared to be linked to increased activity of a common enzyme named @entity49 , they theorised			0
the ' apparent spontaneous cure ' throws up an intriguing avenue for drug engineers , the team said in a statement			0
' the work opens up therapeutic avenues for a cure , using or stimulating this enzyme , and avenues for identifying individuals among newly - infected patients who have a chance of a spontaneous cure			2
' the work , published in the journal @entity64 and @entity65 , was carried out by scientists at @entity14 's @entity67 and @entity68 ( @entity69 )			0
@entity3 replicates by invading human @entity71 immune cells , which it reprogrammes to become virus factories			1
a rare group of people -- fewer than one percent of those infected -- are naturally able to rein in viral replication and keep the virus at clinically undetectable levels			1
they are known as ' elite controllers ' , but the mechanism by which they keep the virus at bay remains a mystery			1

though they remained infected , standard tests could not detect the virus in their blood			2
the team found that in both cases , the virus was unable to replicate in immune cells due to mutations in its genetic code			1
the researchers suggested spontaneous evolution between humans and the virus , a process called ' endogenisation ' that is believed to have neutralised other viruses in humans in the past			2
a similar process has been witnessed in a population of koalas that has integrated an @entity11 - like virus into their genes , neutralised it , and were passing resistance on to their offspring			1
' we propose that @entity3 cure may occur through hiv endogenisation in humans , ' the team wrote			0
' these findings suggest that without therapeutic and prophylactic strategies , after several decades of hiv / host integrations and millions of deaths , it is likely that a few individuals might have endogenised and neutralised the virus and transmitted it to their progeny , ' they added			0
@entity3 within the blood - stream : @entity3 replicates by invading human @entity71 immune cells , which it reprogrammes to become virus factories			1
' we believe that the persistence of @entity135 can lead to cure , and protection , from @entity3			0
' the approach hitherto has been the opposite : to try and clear all traces of @entity3 from human cells and from cell reservoirs where they hide			0
' we suggest that persistence of integrated @entity135 is not a barrier , but on the contrary , may be a prerequisite to @entity3 cure , ' said the study authors			0
' we propose a new vision of @entity3 cure through integration , inactivation and potential endogenisation of a viral genome into the human genome			0
' - not unique - the team said they did not believe the two patients were unique or that the phenomenon was new			0
and they called for ' massive sequencing ' of human dna , particularly from @entity162 who had been exposed to @entity3 for longest , to find further proof			0
only one person is thought to have ever been cured of @entity3 : @entity165 who had bone marrow transplants as a treatment for leukaemia , from a donor with resistance to @entity3			0
a baby given @entity174 drugs immediately after birth for 18 months , was at first also thought to have been cured , but the virus later came back .			0

fewer than 1 *%* of those infected are naturally able to rein in viral replication and keep the virus at clinically undetectable levels
they are known as ' elite controllers '
researchers say @entity11 - causing virus remained in their immune cells but was inactivated because its genetic code had been altered
