@entity0 have sprung to the defence of full - back @entity2 , suggesting he may be the victim of a witch hunt over further allegations of homophobic abuse			1
the 22 - year - old @entity8 international served a five - match ban earlier this year after being found guilty of making homophobic comments to referee @entity12 during @entity0 ’ @entity14 game at @entity15 on may 30 and now the @entity16 is investigating claims that he made an abusive comment during last friday ’s home defeat by @entity21			1
@entity2 was shown on television mouthing a comment to @entity24 forward @entity26 , which was apparently heard by match referee @entity27 , and @entity0 say the @entity16 has employed the services of a lip reader to aid their investigation			1
public backing : @entity0 have jumped to the defence of full back @entity2 following fresh allegations punished : @entity2 served a five - match ban earlier this year after being found guilty of making homophobic comments to referee @entity12 the @entity0 stood by their player following his ban in june and on wednesday called for an external investigation into the actions of the governing body and its officials into their ' vigorous ' pursuit of the alleged incident			1
@entity0 chief executive @entity43 said : ' we are concerned there appears to be a witch hunt by the @entity16 towards @entity2 and we are calling for an external investigation into the issues surrounding the investigation			2
' we know the match commissioner was asked by the media at the post-match press conference if the referee had reported any incident or comment and they were told " no "			0
' we want to know why the referee ’s report quite mysteriously now contains a reference to a possible comment			0
unhappy : @entity43 ( left ) is not pleased with the way full back @entity2 has bee treated ' it seems incongruent with the @entity16 ’s stance and the vigour that they are now pursuing this incident with that the referee would not have reported this to his superior on the night , as is the protocol in these circumstances , or taken action during the game			2
' we understand a @entity21 player has been interviewed and he has stated he did not hear anything			0
there is a hint of mystery about the whole issue and the use of a lip reader has added a new dimension to on - field conduct , particularly when games are televised			0
' a spokesman for the @entity16 declined to confirm whether the services of a lip reader were being called on			0
' an investigation is taking place , ' he said			0
@entity0 confirmed that @entity2 would play against @entity91 in friday ’s top - six clash at the @entity93			1
@entity43 added : ' whilst the @entity16 deliberate , we will continue to support @entity2 and at the same time press the @entity16 for clear transparency about the whole process			2
