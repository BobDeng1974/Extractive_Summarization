they 've toured museums , hosted a trade conference and even watched a high tech toilet maker present his newest design , but @entity6 and @entity7 are now on their way home to the @entity10			1
before they boarded the plane , however , the couple attended a farewell supper with their hosts : @entity18 's @entity17 and @entity19			1
ever the style queen , @entity7 pulled out all the stops for her final night on @entity18 soil , turning out to meet the @entity18 couple in a striking silver grey dress and a sparkling diamond brooch			1
striking though @entity7 's wardrobe is , the @entity10 couple 's visit was almost eclipsed by the unexpected appearance of @entity56 , who made her first public appearance for 11 years during a state dinner held in their honour			2
@entity61 , who was accompanied by her husband @entity62 for the event , had last appeared in public at a state dinner for the president of @entity67 in 2003			0

the three - day visit , which was designed to boost trade between @entity18 and the @entity10 , saw the royal couple take in a design museum , before taking part in an investment development meeting alongside @entity10 officials			1

but while @entity126 and @entity125 's reign has so far gone smoothly , @entity7 and her husband have had a rougher ride in recent months thanks in part to the @entity139 tragedy , which left the @entity10 reeling			2
