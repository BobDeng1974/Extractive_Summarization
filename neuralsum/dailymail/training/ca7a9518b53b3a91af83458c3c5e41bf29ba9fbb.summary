published : 08:03 est , 22 april 2014 updated : 09:19 est , 22 april 2014 with booming bass and heavy hip hop beats thundering through their walls 24 - hours a day , the neighbours of @entity1 , an aspiring rapper , were less than impressed			1
now , after 18 months of noise , 15 visits from the council , one noise abatement order and one court appearance , @entity1 has finally switched off his speakers - but says he still does n't understand what he did wrong			1
' i just went to court with the truth , the truth being that i was n't causing no one a nuisance with the music , ' says @entity1 of the court appearance that finally put a stop to his music career			1
' i did n't really get what they were talking about			0
' rapper : @entity1 had a successful music career in his native @entity25 , including a number one hit unpopular : rapper @entity1 was the subject of 82 complaints to the council from neighbours but while @entity1 claims to have done nothing wrong , neighbours at the @entity34 council block he calls home would beg to differ			1
' we live in a commercial block of flats and they 're not brilliantly made , ' said one neighbour , who has asked not to be named because of what she describes as ' intimidating ' behaviour on @entity1 's part			2
' they have thin walls ! ' it was severe bass - the bass was quite bad and it was horrendous music			1
the way he portrays himself and the way he acts makes me think he is threatening , ' she continues			0
' many times i 've thought i 'll go up there and say something but then i think , what if he turns on me ? how am i going to deal with that ? ' @entity1 's musical career began in his native @entity25 , where his talent for rapping brought him a number one hit record			1
but after moving to @entity63 almost four years ago , success proved harder to come by and @entity64 was forced to relocate his equipment to his @entity34 flat			2
' i 'm into r&b , rap , dancehall , ' he reveals			0
' i 've been through a few up and downs here and there , obviously got in trouble with the police and stuff , and i used to walk around in gangs of youths			0
i had a community studio and i 'd go there and make music			2
' i saw that studio as a way to make me better			0
then i got myself a job , worked there for a few months , made a bit of money and started buying my equipment			0
' obviously , i needed speakers and i needed the mixer tape to normalise my beats and stuff , and i needed a microphone to record my stuff and mix it up			0
' but for those living next door , @entity1 's dedication to his music proved unbearable with vibrating walls caused by the bass and continual noise among the most irksome side - effects			1
' sometimes it would n't start until 1am so you 'd think , hooray peace and quiet for one night , and then suddenly , it would start , and you 'd think , what ? ! , ' complains his disgruntled neighbour			2
unimpressed : a neighbour who did n't want to be named said the constant loud music made her walls vibrate baffled : @entity1 was the subject of 82 complaints from neighbours but says he 's done nothing wrong ' he was outside on his balcony one time and everything was quiet , ' she continues			1
' then i heard him say , " f * * * it ! i 'll go acapella " and he started rapping to himself and his friends			0
' @entity123 , she and other neighbours complained to the council and @entity1 received the first of 15 visits over the next 18 months			1
in total , @entity64 's music had been complained about a whopping 82 times			1
' i really did n't see the need to go to the council and start pointing fingers like they did to me , ' gripes an unrepentant @entity1			1
' these walls are really thick walls so i do n't see how the sound would travel from this room to the next			2
i do n't see how it would vibrate the room			0
' ' @entity137 was a big problem , obviously , because it made my walls vibrate , ' adds his neighbour			0
' but i could hear his music in every single room of my home			2
passion : @entity1 says that despite the setbacks , he will never stop making music because it 's the love of his life ' even in the bath , i could still feel the bass - even with my head under water			1
even that did n't block out the sound			0
' after more than a year and a half of complaints and a noise abatement order that was repeatedly breached , @entity1 found himself in court where he was handed a three month conditional discharge and a Â £ 1,000 fine			1
as a result , @entity1 was forced to shut down his studio and move it to his brother 's home in a suburban street a mile away			1
' now he 's stopped the music , i 've got a much better life , ' says his relieved neighbour			0
' now i can go out , go to work , come home , relax and go to bed when i want			0
' @entity1 , however , has no plans to give up his musical career , even if he ca n't do it from home			1
' i 'm just going to keep coming and doing my music as i always did , ' he explains			0
' it 's like i said , music is my addiction			0
it 's not going to stop ever			0
' @entity1 appears in @entity182 , tonight at 8pm on @entity183			2
