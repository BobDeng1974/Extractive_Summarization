last night skywatchers were treated to the annual @entity2 meteor shower			1
but later this month we might be in store for a meteor storm that has never been seen before as @entity6 passes through the tail of a comet			1
as our planet passes through debris from @entity12 , astronomers say we could see as many as 1,000 shooting stars per hour			1
on the nights of 23 and 24 may sky watchers could be in for a treat as @entity6 passes through the debris left by @entity12			1
this could provide observers in the @entity19 and @entity20 with up to 1,000 meteors an hour in what has been described as a ' meteor storm ' the event will occur on the nights of 23 and 24 may , when @entity6 ’s path crosses that of the comet , and will first be most visible from the northern @entity19 and southern @entity20 as well as parts of @entity29			1
from the @entity31 the event is not expected to be visible , although on before dawn on 24 may some meteors may still be visible			0
as our planet moves into the ' blizzard ' of of ice and rock chunks , they will burn up in the atmosphere , providing observers below with slow moving but bright meteors			0
the reason we could see so many meteors is because all of the debris it has ejected between 1803 and 1924 will be in @entity6 ’s path			2
‘ this potential new shower is so new that astronomers are n’t sure what to expect , ’ said @entity47 of @entity49 ’s @entity48 in @entity50 , @entity51			0
‘ predictions run from less than 100 meteors per hour up to an unlikely but possible meteor storm as high as 1,000 per hour			2
’ the comet was first spotted back in february 2004 , but this is the first chance encounter between it and @entity6			2
the discovery was made by the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) project			0
it completes an orbit of the @entity65 every 5.09 years , with its orbit ranging from just inside that of @entity6 to almost as far as @entity68			0
following our encounter with its tail , the comet will be as close as 5 million miles ( 8.3 million kilometres ) to @entity6 on 29 may before it makes its way out towards @entity68 again on its orbit			0
the meteor storm will be visible in the night sky from the northern @entity19 and southern @entity20 , as well as other swathes of the @entity78 ( see next picture )			1
the best views will be towards the @entity81 ( @entity82 ) above @entity83 , with this meteor storm being dubbed @entity84 however , there is still a chance the event will not be as impressive as predicted			0
‘ the idea of a brand new meteor shower is indeed very exciting , ’ astronomer @entity88 from @entity89 tells @entity92			2
‘ the shower has been referred to as a " meteor storm " , however , judging by recent calculations , the idea of a phenomena that will see 1,000 meteors per hour is in fact dwindling			1
‘ we ’re more likely to see a strong shower rather than a storm of meteors			0
‘ however , of course , we wo n’t know it ’s true strength until we head outside and observe the meteor shower for ourselves when @entity108 arrives			2
’ amateur astronomers are advised to keep their eyes on the sky as @entity6 makes its way through the comet 's tail later this month			1
on its first night the meteor storm will be visible in the @entity19 and @entity20			1
as @entity6 rotates and moves , however , parts of @entity29 should also be treated to a view			0
as the extent of the meteor storm is unknown , your best bet is to keep an eye on reports as the event draws near this 30 april 2014 image was taken using the @entity126 20 " telescope located in @entity128			0
@entity12 ( pictured in circle ) was first spotted in february 2004 , but this will be its first encounter with @entity6			1
the comet completes an orbit of the sun roughly every five years			0

a *remarkable* new meteor shower is set to take place later this month
event will occur during the nights of 23 and 24 may in the @entity19 and @entity20
the *origin* of the shower is @entity12 , first spotted in 2004
but this will be the first time @entity6 has passed through its ' tail ' of debris
astronomers predict sky watchers might see up to 1,000 meteors an hour
