anyone taking a stroll down this central @entity3 street might be forced to do a double take when they see this unusual property			1
with its front doors high up in the air and its roof running along the pavement , this building has seemingly been flipped upside down			0
artist @entity12 built the new facade on to the existing building to create the new piece of art for the annual @entity17 in @entity3			1
artist @entity12 turns the world on its head by creating this upside - down house in @entity3 the 29 - year - old , who lives in @entity24 , east @entity3 , started work on the piece in october , the day after his ' sliding house ' in @entity22 had been completed			1
he has worked with a range of construction companies since october to create the artwork , called @entity30 , on a building in @entity32 , @entity3 , which is due to be demolished			2
mr @entity12 said : ' i 'm keen on this idea that when people go to an art gallery they go there through choice and they enter into that experience			1
' but with public sculpture , people do n't necessarily make that choice - they may not like the artwork or may not want the artwork and therefore i think it 's important for the work to be able to disappear and not dominate its environment , but be harmonious with the environment			0
' for that reason i used only the materials which feature across @entity49 and @entity32 so although the artwork is quite bold it also has subtlety and the ability to camouflage into its environment			0
' built in 1780 , the building was originally used as livery stables , housing horses and carriages for hire			2
mr @entity12 created the artwork as part of the annual @entity17 , in @entity3 mr @entity12 ( right ) has worked with a range of construction companies since october to build the piece the access through the building was also used to transport live cattle and goods from the courtyard to trade along the @entity68			1
mr @entity12 said the conecpt for the artwork had been inspired by the shape of the building and the links to its heritage			1
he said : ' the original building had been conceived with a function in mind			0
' there was a yard at the back of the building and that was used to store cattle and the alleyway that is now used for vehicular access was used to move cattle and they would lead the cattle to the @entity68 and to the market			0
' because the shape of the building was so closely intertwined with its heritage , i created a concept , an artwork , that actually responded to the shape of the building			2
mr @entity12 started work on his latest piece after completing this ' sliding house ' in @entity22 ' so i have created seemingly two buildings which are seemingly upside down			1
' the building itself was used as a residential unit for families and workers			0
in 1880 the ground floor shop unit changed use and was listed in the local @entity108 as a pawn broker , while the passageway to the side was used to gain access to the @entity114 site			0
from the 1800 â€™s onwards the history of the building is unknown			0
@entity117 , chairman of @entity118 and @entity119 at @entity120 , said : ' in the space of little over a decade , @entity118 has been transformed into one of the most unique places in @entity3 , the @entity124 and internationally for a cultural , business , residential and visitor experience			2
' we are immensely proud that these artists are giving their time to help us celebrate that success through the @entity131			0
' other works by mr @entity12 includes a factory in @entity134 , @entity24 , with 312 identially smahed windows .			1
