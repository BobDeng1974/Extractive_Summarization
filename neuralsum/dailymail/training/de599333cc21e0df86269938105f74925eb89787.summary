by @entity1 reporter published : 05:40 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 09:52 est , 28 november 2013 most people dread a trip to the dentist and it was no different for this polar bear , who has had to endure an operation to remove her sore teeth			2
the 11 - month - old polar bear cub , who keepers have named @entity12 , was discovered in @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , after her mother abandoned her in the wild			1
she appeared unusually thin and during a routine exam vets discovered she had some broken teeth - which led to her transportation to @entity22 in nearby @entity23			1
like a bear with a sore ... mouth ? a dentist reaches gingerly between the jaws of @entity12 , an 11 - month - old abandoned polar bear cub , who had to endure an operation to remove three teeth that were infected this wo n't hurt a bit : vets used general anaesthetic to subdue the otherwise fierce juvenile polar bear so they could remove two baby teeth and an adult tooth , which were broken and infected a team headed by veterinary dentist dr @entity40 sedated the young bear before lying her out and removing two baby teeth and one adult tooth which was broken and infected			1
her recovery will take place at the newly constructed @entity45 where staff hope to introduce @entity12 to the zoo 's latest polar cub addition - 11 - month - old @entity49			2
dr @entity50 , the zoo 's head of veterinary services , said : ' in the wild this sort of tooth decay absolutely happens but in captivity we want to address it - we want her as comfortable and as healthy as she can be			2
' this kind of dental surgery is much the same as working on humans but doing it on zoo animals adds a whole new complication			0
' right now she might only be about 110lbs but she still has the attitude of a 600lb predator - so it 's certainly not safe to just ask her to open her mouth			0
' the @entity72 of man - eating beasts ? the 11 - month - old polar bear cub , who keepers have named @entity12 , was discovered in @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , after her mother abandoned her in the wild looks cute ... but dr @entity50 said @entity12 had the attitude of a 600lb polar bear dr @entity50 added that following the operation @entity12 would quickly recover			1
he said : ' she 'll be back at the centre and within a few days she 'll be back to her old self eating well and her new friend @entity49 will provide her with some companionship and an outlet for all her energy			0
' @entity12 has already gained seven kilograms since arriving at the zoo so she is well on the way to recovery			0
' adult polar bears have 42 razor sharp teeth and their canines are larger and longer than any other bears .			0
