click here to read the full match report the question was simple enough : with @entity6 ’s five star forwards all fit and ready to start , who would @entity3 leave out against @entity7 ? when the answer became clear an hour before kick - off on sunday , it was bad news for @entity12			1
the @entity14 was not only left out of the starting line - up , he was n’t even on the bench			1
it soon became clear that he had been dropped and it is understood that @entity19 had not explained the reasons why			2
‘ @entity12 is n’t injured he ’s just not selected in the squad , ’ said the @entity6 boss , having admitted on the eve of this match that five players into four positions simply would n’t go			1
@entity12 was not included in @entity3 's squad to face @entity7 on sunday @entity28 ( centre ) strips off to celebrate his goal in @entity7 's 1 - 0 victory over @entity32 @entity6 players trudge off at @entity34 after failing to register a single shot on target @entity7 boss @entity37 ( left ) would have enjoyed getting the upper hand over @entity3 ‘ it ’s much more difficult selecting a side but that ’s the task of the manager and i have a staff who advise me as well			1
’ ‘ we have now a lot of players who are coming back and he has played the last few matches in a row			2
then i have to compare players with each other			2
‘ now he is out of the 18 but that is this moment			2
next week is another moment , ' he added after the defeat			2
‘ we have now a lot of players who are coming back and he has played the last few matches in a row			0
then i have to compare players with each other			0
‘ now he is out of the 18 but that is this moment			0

’ the manner of @entity12 ’s omission was surprising , however , and will inevitably raise questions over his prospects of persuading @entity6 to part with the best part of £ 50million to turn his loan from @entity69 into a permanent move at the end of the season			1
having spent much of the season building up his fitness for the rigours of @entity77 football after a serious knee injury and then recovering from a calf problem , @entity12 will have every reason to be rather perplexed over this snub			1
teenager @entity82 was preferred for a place on the bench , and it was unclear whether @entity12 was even at @entity34			1
he had started the previous five games despite the heavy workload over @entity88 , scoring twice			0
it might not be quite £ 50m form , but he was certainly starting to find his feet in the @entity92 after so many doubts had been raised			1
@entity12 was a surprise loan signing with @entity6 given the option to buy him outright at the end of the season the on - loan @entity69 striker has spoken of his desire to remain at @entity34 beyond this season the @entity101 international has only started eight @entity92 games since his arrival @entity12 has reportedly taken time to adapt to @entity6 manager @entity3 's precise philosophy in his absence , the rest of @entity6 ’s expensive strikeforce looked very ordinary			1
they could n’t even manage one shot on target , the first time that has happened since may 2009			0
@entity19 deployed @entity113 and @entity114 in central midfield , and asked @entity116 to play off @entity117 after the £ 59.7m signing returned to action with a goal in the @entity121 at @entity122 last weekend			0
but @entity123 looked like a player who had been out of action for a while			0
so good at dead - ball situations usually , he threw his head back in frustration after firing one freekick straight into the legs of the first defender , and then failed to find @entity114 with a final ball nine minutes before half - time when @entity135 had lifted a pass over the @entity7 defence			1
@entity113 lacked the creativity he has shown of late from midfield and @entity114 was guilty of missing two clear chances late in the game			2
by then , @entity135 and @entity123 had both left the field , leaving @entity144 to partner @entity113 up front			0
the 28 - year - old celebrates scoring his first @entity92 goal against @entity147 in october @entity12 's goal against @entity149 on @entity150 was only his third in the league all season @entity12 has to compete with the likes of @entity114 ( left ) and @entity113 ( centre ) for a starting spot but @entity7 coped comfortably with the threat despite losing centre - back @entity158 to injury early in the game			1
they were compact and disciplined , with @entity162 the pick of a very good bunch in his defensive midfield role alongside @entity166			0
@entity37 will certainly enjoy this tactical victory over his old @entity169 adversary @entity19 and his embarrassment of riches			0
could @entity12 have made a difference ? possibly			1
but the nature of his absence poses more questions than it answers			0
the former @entity177 frontman has failed to find the form he enjoyed in @entity179			0

@entity6 were beaten 1 - 0 by @entity7 in the @entity92
@entity12 did not even make @entity3 's squad for the game
the @entity34 club are still *undecided* over whether to offer the @entity188 international a permanent contract
