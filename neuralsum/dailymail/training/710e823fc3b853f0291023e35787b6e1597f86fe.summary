it took me long enough to win my first one			0
‘ on his own won this off top weight and was only just beaten in a @entity3 ( last season ) so we ’ll have to think of going the same way with this horse			2
‘ we always thought he could be a @entity3 horse			0
it was probably an unfair question to ask him in the @entity32 on his first run of the season but we felt he was nicely handicapped			0
jockey @entity9 beams after giving trainer @entity12 a record sixth win at the race ‘ that race will take a fair bit out of him so he would n’t run between now and @entity55			1
the way he travelled and jumped was great , and i do n’t think @entity9 had a moment ’s worry			0
’ @entity0 raced on the heels of the leaders throughout the race before smoothly moving into contention			2
the job is @entity63 was his only danger in the straight			0
he fell at the last but @entity9 had still to ask for everything and looked comfortably in control .			0
