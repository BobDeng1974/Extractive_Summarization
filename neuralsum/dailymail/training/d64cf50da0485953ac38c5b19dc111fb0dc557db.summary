the @entity7 refused to pay for an ' adequate lawyer ' for @entity4 , 56 , who was sentenced to death by firing squad by a court in @entity5 for taking £ 1.6million of cocaine onto the island			1
her appeal against the decision was rejected by master of the @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 at the @entity2			2
the judges said the government 's policy of not providing funding for legal representation to any @entity13 national who faces criminal proceedings abroad - even in death penalty cases - was not unlawful			1
last month , @entity4 's lawyers attempted to challenge an earlier @entity40 ruling that the government was not legally obliged to pay for ' an adequate lawyer ' to represent her			1
but on april 22 the three judges dismissed the appeal by @entity4 , from @entity45 in @entity46 , saying they would give their reasons at a later date			2
announcing those reasons today in a written judgment , @entity27 said : ' one is bound to have great sympathy for the appellant			0
' she is seeking to challenge a decision which , if not overturned by the @entity54 , will mean that she will be executed , unless she is pardoned			0
' the death penalty is , in my view , rightly regarded by the government as immoral and unacceptable			0
' @entity4 , pictured in her cell , was sentenced to death by firing squad after cocaine was found in her suitcase he said @entity4 had argued that the policy of the foreign secretary of not providing funding for legal representation in criminal proceedings abroad , even in death penalty cases , was ' unlawful '			1
but he said the @entity40 was ' right to conclude that it is not '			0
@entity27 described @entity4 as ' a vulnerable person suffering from physical and mental health problems '			0
he said the @entity15 prosecutor had requested a sentence of 15 years imprisonment but judges at the @entity76 of @entity77 sentenced her to death on january 22			2
she appealed against conviction and sentence , but on april 10 the @entity40 of @entity77 dismissed the appeal			0
@entity4 was arrested at @entity5 's airport last may after 10.6lb of cocaine was found in the lining of her suitcase during a routine customs check			1
at last month 's hearing in @entity88 , @entity27 and the two other judges heard that @entity4 needed about £ 8,000 to take her fight on to the @entity54			1
@entity27 said today that by the time the challenge from the @entity40 's decision was heard by the @entity2 ' some part of the sum required had been donated to the appellant '			1
the @entity2 said @entity7 's policy is based on ' coherent ' reasoning and was not ' unlawful ' master of the rolls , @entity27 said @entity4 is vulnerable and has ' physical and mental health problems ' he added : ' it seems that , since the date of the hearing , she has received by third party donations the whole of the sum required			1
' it may , therefore , be that the appellant no longer has an interest in the outcome of the appeal			0
' but the appeal raises points which have implications for other @entity13 nationals facing the death penalty abroad			2
' @entity4 is believed to have accrued more than £ 10,000 from public donations through a fundraising web page			0
@entity27 said it was the ' longstanding policy of the @entity13 to oppose the death penalty in all circumstances as a matter of principle '			2
he said : ' as the @entity125 concedes , it would be possible to produce a policy under which funds for legal representation were made available to @entity13 nationals in certain defined circumstances			1
' the practical problems identified by the secretary of state are not insurmountable			0
' but the question is not whether the secretary of state could produce a different policy which many would regard as fairer and more reasonable and humane than the present policy			0
' it is whether the policy that he has produced is irrational			0
' i am in no doubt that the policy is not irrational			0
it is based on reasoning which is coherent and which is neither arbitrary nor perverse			1

@entity4 was sentenced to death by firing squad at a court in @entity5
arrested in may 2012 when £ 1.6million of cocaine was found in her suitcase
the @entity13 government refused to pay for legal representation for her
