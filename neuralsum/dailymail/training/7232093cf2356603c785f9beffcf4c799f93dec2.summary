by @entity1 reporter if you ’re short of money , this might be the cashpoint for you – for it is barely a couple of feet off the ground			0
the atm has been installed outside a @entity10 in @entity11 and , since it is the only one available outside the store , customers have been left with little choice but to use it			1
it means they have to squat or kneel to get down to the level of the keypad			0
’ low on funds ? you have to squat to use this cashpoint outside a @entity10 in @entity11 mystery : the cashpoint in @entity11 is at knee - level , far too low for wheelchair users musician @entity26 , 27 , was one of several who spotted the atm and posted a picture on social media			1
‘ i could n’t believe it , ’ he said			0
‘ it was just so low to the ground and a man using it was squatting to try to get his money out			2
‘ the poor guy must have done his back in			0
’ @entity37 commented on his post : ' this makes no sense ! ' @entity10 's were unable to shed any more light on the situation , saying merely that the cashpoint ' is located on a hill , which caused it to be built so low to the ground '			1
when asked to clarify , a spokesman refused to explain further , saying merely : ' our statement says it all '			0
a spokesman for the nearby @entity53 wheelchair and scooter shop said the @entity9 was far too low to have been installed with wheelchair users in mind			2
no - one seems quite sure why the atm is built so close to the ground , not even @entity10 's themselves people wanting to use the cashpoint have to bend double or squat to reach the buttons on the @entity9 he said : ' our wheelchairs are 30 inches up from the ground to the seat , which means the cashpoint would need to be at least 30 inches up , plus another 10 inches for someone to be able to reach the keys			1
' the @entity9 appears to be too low even for wheelchair users			2
a spokesman for @entity72 , a local shop , said the cashpoint would need to be more than 3ft off the ground to be used comfortably			1
a @entity10 ’s spokesman only added to the mystery yesterday by saying it was installed so low down because it is located on a hill			1
unable to clarify why the slope would affect its position , he said : ‘ we have never had any customer complaints about this but we are looking at solutions to relocate it .			0
