order and progress – @entity2 e @entity3 – read the @entity5 flags adorning the stands at the @entity7 on sunday , and the @entity9 stars have certainly made some decent headway since their unceremonious exit from their home @entity13 eight months ago			1
make no mistake , this was no vintage @entity16 showing			2
there was little of the free - flowing football we have come to expect from @entity16			1
head coach @entity22 , himself a @entity13 - winning defensive midfielder , has implemented a defence - first policy , with long balls up to the strikers very much the order of the day as far as attacking play was concerned			1
@entity28 celebrates after scoring the opening goal during the friendly match between @entity16 and @entity31 @entity28 is congratulated by teammates after scoring the opening goal during the match at @entity7 @entity35 was in the wars again after this foul on the touchline left the @entity40 star in apparent agony but @entity16 , missing @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 from the back four who started the 7 - 1 humiliation against @entity47 , looked a vastly more robust outfit defensively			2
@entity49 , so sorely missed in that ill - fated semi-final , was an assured presence at the heart of the back line , while centre - back partner @entity54 weighed in with impressive physicality – especially in dealing with the driving force and trickery of @entity58			2
@entity16 are the pioneers of the attacking full back , but much - coveted @entity65 defender @entity64 , despite his excellent through - ball for @entity63 ’s opener , was relatively reserved on the right side of defence			1
@entity64 ( right ) springs into an acrobatic challenge to try and win back possession for his side from @entity58 @entity71 @entity72 @entity73 @entity74 @entity75 @entity76 @entity77 @entity78 @entity79 @entity81 @entity80 @entity82 left back @entity83 , perhaps a surprising inclusion given his culpability in @entity86 , was also uncharacteristically disciplined , but still offered support to @entity35 and @entity88 when the situation called for it			0
sitting midfielders @entity91 and @entity93 – the latter being the only other survivor from the @entity13 semi-final – were effective in protecting the back four and took their clear pre-match objective to kick lumps out of @entity58 very seriously			2
though the @entity100 man rode his luck a few too many times in dangerous positions			0
where @entity22 ’s men really struggled to deal with @entity31 ’s high - pressing game was in attacking midfield			2
@entity88 and @entity108 were hassled and harried by their opponents ’ packed midfield on the rare occasions they maintained possession , and as a result created very little for their forwards , who were often forced to drop deep to influence the game			0
@entity16 forward @entity81 struggles to keep his balance as @entity119 challenges his opponent for possession @entity40 star @entity35 keeps his eye on the ball as he tries to control and begin another attack @entity40 star @entity35 is evidently in pain after @entity127 's cynical stamp at the @entity7 on sunday predictably , @entity35 drew the majority of attention – both from his baying supporters and his on - pitch adversaries – and he was by far @entity16 ’s biggest threat in attack			1
his lively play in a free role was vital to ensure they did n’t stagnate at the business end of the pitch and his ability to occupy multiple defenders was invaluable to his side			0
strike partner @entity81 , on the other hand , was ineffectual			0
with the creativity of @entity88 and @entity108 stifled , the @entity144 man saw very little of the ball and appeared disinterested in forcing the issue			0
@entity35 has all eyes on the ball against @entity31 midfielder @entity127 at the @entity7 on sunday @entity150 left back @entity83 attempts to clear the ball under pressure from @entity154 during the friendly @entity16 manager @entity22 passes on instructions to his right back @entity64 as he watches his side take on @entity31 @entity159 forward @entity58 sprints away from @entity49 ( left ) on the @entity7 pitch @entity28 skips past the on - coming @entity161 on 72 minutes to slot @entity16 ahead at the @entity7 stadium his replacement , @entity28 , showed impressive composure in scoring @entity16 ’s winner , and his intelligent movement was a definite upgrade			1
though at that stage , @entity169 ’s men were looking leggy after 72 minutes of dogged pressing , and @entity28 exploited this			0
on the whole , we witnessed a complete change in @entity16 ’s philosophy since the @entity13 , which is not necessarily a bad thing			1
their gung - ho approach dictated by passionate home support was perhaps their biggest downfall last summer			0
a lengthy @entity183 wave in the first half told the story of @entity16 ’s performance , but in sacrificing an emphasis on attack @entity22 looks to have addressed @entity16 ’s major defensive defects			1
attacking cohesion will have to wait .			0

former defensive midfielder @entity22 has implemented a defence - first policy
it 's a far cry from the days of samba football the fans have come to expect
long balls up to the strikers are very much the order of the day in attack
but new new - look @entity16 have won eight in a *row* since their @entity13 exit
