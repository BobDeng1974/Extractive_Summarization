by @entity0 published : 17:12 est , 20 december 2012 updated : 03:09 est , 21 december 2012 if @entity4 shouts ‘ alarm ’ , his dog @entity1 is trained to press a panic button			1
but when he slipped into a diabetic coma , he was far beyond shouting – and seemingly beyond help			0
@entity1 , however , had other ideas			0
when she found mr @entity4 , 47 , slumped on the floor , the clever black labrador took matters into her own paws – and pressed the button all by herself			1
paw talent : @entity1 raised the alarm by pushing a panic button when @entity4 slipped into a diabetic coma initiative : @entity1 managed to press @entity4 's panic button even though he was unconscious and unable to give her the command it alerted staff at a 24 - hour control centre who tried to contact mr @entity4 , before dialling 999 and calling his neighbours for help			1
mr @entity4 , who also has neuropathy – nerve damage , a common complication of diabetes – was taken from his home in @entity33 to @entity35 hospital and put on a drip to restore his blood sugar levels			1
the former it consultant said : ‘ @entity1 is my very own @entity39 – she saved my life , and if it was n’t for her , i would n’t be here now			2
’ ‘ she is a lifeline for me anyway - she is specially trained to help me do household tasks , as i have trouble getting about and lifting and carrying things on my own			0
mr @entity4 was rushed to @entity46 after @entity1 raised the alarm where he was put on a drip to reduce his blood sugar levels ‘ i ca n’t believe how clever she is			1
we have trained her to press my emergency button on command , and i often use it to call for help if i ’ve fallen at home and ca n’t get up			2
‘ never in my wildest dreams did i think that @entity1 understood the consequences of her pressing the button - that help always arrives			2
‘ the emergency services were amazed when they realised it was my dog who had called for help			0
‘ she ’s one in a million - my best friend			0
’ @entity1 was trained by canine assistance charity @entity63 , who provide assistance dogs to people with disabilities to help them with day to day life			0
mr @entity4 , who gave up work five years ago when his nerve damage worsened , relies on @entity1 to pick up things from the ground , which is difficult for him , and often causes him to fall			1
as part of her training , the four - year - old was taught to press the emergency button if @entity4 gets into difficulties , and has done so around ten times in the last two - and - a - half years			1
the button contacts staff at @entity35 and @entity81 , a charity which owns and manages 5,600 homes in the borough that were formerly council housing stock			2
mr @entity4 , who is divorced , said of the incident last month : ‘ i ’d been out in the morning with @entity1 doing some shopping and all was well but my bloods had been low			1
‘ i ate lunch but was then sick and so felt a tad rough in the afternoon and at around 6:30 @entity1 and i had a game of tugging a rope , which was my last memory for a while			0
‘ the lifeline button was pressed at 7:45pm			2
the team were shouting for me through the speaker - usually we can shout to each other using this no matter where i might be in the flat - but when they heard no response from me they realised @entity1 must have pressed the alarm and summoned help			0
’ a spokesperson for @entity63 said : ‘ we train all our dogs in emergency procedures , whether it is fetching help or activating a lifeline button			0
‘ usually the dogs do this on command , but in @entity1 ’s case she knew @entity4 was in trouble and worked out that by pressing the button help would be summoned			1
‘ we are very proud of @entity1			0
’ life - saver : mr @entity4 said he has no doubt that if it was n't for @entity1 he would have died			1

@entity121 saved owner @entity4 after he passed out unconscious
pressed panic button with her paw and *paramedics* arrived
' if it was n't for her , i would n't be here now , ' he said
