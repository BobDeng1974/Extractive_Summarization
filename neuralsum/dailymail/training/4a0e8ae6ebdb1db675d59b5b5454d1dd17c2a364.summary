it 's the luxury @entity1 villa where @entity3 and @entity4 once enjoyed a romantic getaway – now holidaymakers can enjoy the same experience ... provided they can stump up the £ 20,000 - a - week rent			0
@entity4 ’s ‘ black sheep ’ uncle @entity9 has started marketing the @entity11 – supposedly named after the island ’s ‘ banging ’ dance music scene – as a high - class getaway			2
in 2006 the @entity16 couple stayed at the house , where it recruitment millionaire mr @entity9 , 48 , was once caught apparently chopping up lines of cocaine in a tabloid sting			1
dipping into the savings : the villa has a swimming pool as luxurious as you would expect for £ 20,000 a week hit the decks : prince @entity3 tried his hand at djing on this terrace when he and @entity4 stayed in 2006 perfectly luxurious : @entity9 put the villa on the market for £ 6million last year , but could n't find a buyer at your service : a peculiar statue of a moustachioed butler delivering champagne is just one quirky feature black sheep : it recruitment millionaire mr @entity9 , right , 48 , was once caught apparently chopping up lines of cocaine at the house in a tabloid sting			2
a 12ft @entity44 , right , by the pool at the eccentrically appointed villa unconventional figure : mr @entity9 is a self - made millionaire whose reported drug problems and disregard for convention has nevertheless made him an embarrassment to the royal family and the @entity53 last year he put it on the market for £ 6 million , but with no buyers , he ’s renting it out through a website full of glossy pictures – and spelling mistakes			0
for example , it boasts that staff can organise activities such as ‘ raikhi [ and ] body ballencing ’ and can ‘ help with vegitarian cuiseen , as well as help drive you around a bit and sort tables at clubs and resturants ’			0
there ’s also a ‘ @entity74 ’			0
quirky decor includes two gold thrones , a curious statue of a moustachioed butler and a 12ft @entity44 overlooking a pool terrace where @entity3 tried his hand as a dj. but there is one drawback : the villa is near the flightpath for @entity86 , just two miles away			1
prince @entity3 and @entity4 , @entity4 in the @entity87 during the @entity89 tour dream getaway : the villa has two master suites and two smaller bedrooms @entity94 , so good : the luxurious lounge benefits from patio doors with views extending out towards the pool a good taste in music : the dining room features a jukebox and a grand table with space for ten at supper time dramatic : the pool seems lit in glorious ultraviolet at night - which is perhaps another nod to @entity1 rave culture semi-literate : the website advertising the luxurious villa for rent is littered with spelling mistakes jet set : the villa 's location , near the @entity86 airport runway , means tenants may want to keep the music turned up			1

the @entity16 couple stayed at the eccentrically decorated house in 2006
curious name is apparently a *tribute* to @entity127 's ' banging ' music scene
the one drawback is that the villa is on the flightpath for @entity86 airport
