by @entity0 @entity1 has unveiled incredible footage of what it describes as a ‘ graceful ’ solar flare erupting from the sun 's surface			1
the mid-level solar flare erupted on wednesday april 2 , peaking at 2:05pm gmt ( 10:05am edt ) with @entity1 ’s @entity8 capturing the event			1
solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation from the sun. @entity14 radiation from a flare can not pass through @entity17 's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground			1
radiation is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum , from radio waves at the long wavelength end , through optical emission to x-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end			2
the amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of 100 - megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time a flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around sunspots			1
their frequency varies from several a day , when the sun is particularly active , to less than one a week during quiet periods			0
however , when intense enough , they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where gps and communications signals travel			0
this particular flare , classified as an @entity52 flare , is not thought to have caused significant disturbance on @entity17			1
@entity55 - class flares are ten times less powerful than the most intense flares , which are labelled x-class			1
the number after the @entity55 provides more information about its strength			0
an @entity61 is twice as intense as an @entity62 and an @entity63 is three times as intense			2
the mid-level solar flare erupted on wednesday april 2 , peaking at 2:05pm gmt ( 10:05am edt ) with @entity1 's @entity8 capturing the event solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost			1
astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission			0
they do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks			0
the charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the @entity17 ’s magnetic field			2
very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies			0
a positive aspect , from an aesthetic point of view , is that the auroras are enhanced			0
geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents			0
on march 29 , the sun unleashed a massive @entity94 solar flare causing a brief radio disturbance while generating a series of coronal mass ejections ( @entity98 )			1
cmes are powerful plasma eruptions near the surface of the sun driven by kinks in the solar magnetic field			1
earlier this month , scientists came a step closer to understanding this powerful phenomenon behind solar flares by witnessing , for the first time , the mechanism behind it			1
footage put together by an international team led by @entity114 researchers showed entangled magnetic field lines looping from the sun ’s surface			0
these magnetic lines slip around each other and lead to an eruption 35 times the size of the @entity17 and an explosive release of magnetic energy into space			1
the discoveries of a gigantic energy build - up have brought scientists a step closer to predicting when and where large flares will occur			2
solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation			2
@entity1 claims harmful radiation from a flare can not pass through @entity17 's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground ‘ we care about this as during flares we can have @entity98 and sometimes they are sent in our direction , ’ said lead author , dr @entity138 from @entity114			1
‘ human civilisation is nowadays maintained by technology and that technology is vulnerable to space weather			0
' ‘ indeed , coronal mass ejections can damage satellites and therefore have an enormous financial cost			0
’ ‘ they can also threaten airlines by disturbing the @entity17 ’s magnetic field			2
very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies			0

m - class flare erupted on april 2 peaking at 2:05pm gmt ( 10:05am edt )
m - class are 10 times less powerful than the most intense @entity94 flares
flare was not powerful enough to cause significant disturbance on @entity17
several days earlier , the sun had unleashed a massive @entity94 solar flare causing a brief radio disturbance
