@entity5 has been ordered to pull down the £ 10,000 security fence after he was burgled ten times in two months - because it might scare motorists he said : ' over the last few years i 've had around £ 30,000 worth of stuff stolen by these idiots , it 's just a scandal			1
' it 's mostly been expensive tools from this house , which means i ca n't work , and building materials			2
' they have also stolen model aircrafts worth a few thousand pounds and even my children 's toys from the garden			0
' from my old house , which i left because i thought i would be more secure in another property , i had a boat stolen , two cars , a motorbike and my daughters scooter			0
' they have even stolen four or five wheelie bins - and one of them was full of rubbish			0
the boat had around £ 4,000 of work done on it			0
' i reckon i have been bugled around 20 times over the past six years			0
' self - employed mr @entity5 built the six foot fence last year after his electrics business was threatened for months by the burglars			1
mr @entity5 , 51 , built the barrier after thieves relentlessly targeted his home in @entity9 , @entity10			1
but he now claims council chiefs have told him to remove the fence - because it could pose a hazard to drivers he said the fence had been up for almost a year but the council contacted him a couple of months ago to tell him about the complaint and ordered that the fence is amended by january 7 but now , he said a neighbour 's complaint that it causes a blind spot has put his house at risk of being targeted again			1
he said he was given ' verbal planning permission ' by a man from the council who has since left			1
he said : ' the fence means there is a very small blind spot , but there are hazards everywhere in the roads so all it takes is caution and common sense			2
' it causes a brief blind spot , for the blink of an eye , when you come out of the junction			0
' i 've not had any burglaries since putting it up 12 months ago but now i might have to spend even more adjusting it			0
' i could be left with a bill of thousands of pounds after changing the fence to what the council want			1
' i ca n't take it down - i 've been burgled so many times the insurance wo n't even pay out anymore			0
' it 's ridiculous and a scandal , why ca n't anyone use some common sense ? ' he added that the fence has been up for almost a year but the council contacted him a couple of months ago to tell him about the complaint and ordered that the fence is amended by january 7			1
mr @entity5 estimates has now spent around £ 12,000 in total on security - including the fencing , @entity107 , an electric gate , walls and bushes to protect his home he claims his grandchildren are ' terrified ' to visit the house for fear of burglars , added : ' they 've given me two weeks to get it sorted , which is impossible at this time of year			1
' it 's so much hassle , someone is just being vindictive about it			0
it 's going to cost a fortune and it would be an eyesore			0
' i could plant ten foot conifers around this house and get away with it , there 's no common sense whatsoever			0
' i put this up about a year ago and had no trouble , so i do n't know why neighbours are complaining now			0
' mr @entity5 , who lives with partner @entity133 , 56 , made the headlines in 2013 when a sign outside his property warning against thieves			1
he estimates has now spent around £ 12,000 in total on security - including the fencing , @entity107 , an electric gate , walls and bushes to protect his home			2
he said : ' the council just wo n't see any sense			2
they have cocked up and i 've been left to to cough up the costs - i need to protect my house			0
' the fence also acts as a safety guard because so many children climb on the three foot wall it sits on and fall off , then i 'm the one that gets the blame			2
' @entity157 has contacted @entity159 council for comment .			2
