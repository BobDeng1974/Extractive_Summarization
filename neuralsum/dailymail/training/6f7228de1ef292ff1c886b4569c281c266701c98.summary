tragic : @entity0 , who was savaged to death by her daughter 's dogs , pictured at @entity5 's pie and mash shop , @entity7 , where she worked fresh calls were made for a change in the law today after a great - grandmother was apparently mauled to death by her daughter 's dogs in her back garden			1
the five animals pounced on @entity0 , 71 , after she went into the garden to give them their evening meal as a favour to her daughter , @entity21			1
the widow was badly injured when the dogs – two ' giant ' @entity27 @entity26 mastiffs , two @entity29 bulldogs and a small mongrel – seemed to suddenly turn on her			1
she was found dead at the scene in @entity32 , @entity33 on tuesday night			1
currently , police can only prosecute owners of dogs who harm people if the attack happens in public - and they can only forcibly remove illegal dogs			2
however , today further calls were made for the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) to change the law to allow dog control rules to apply everywhere			0
the @entity45 , which represents postmen , is campaigning to change the law and said the @entity48 is failing to protect both dog owners and attack victims			0
they pointed to two incidents where postmen in @entity53 and @entity54 almost lost limbs while carrying out their duties			0
the man who owned two rottweilers that almost tore off the @entity53 postman 's arm in 2008 escaped prosecution			0
brutal : the court heard how all of the dogs , including two @entity26 mastiffs , two @entity29 bulldogs and a small mongrel ( all pictured ) , have been put down after all their bite marks were found on mrs @entity0 ' body @entity71 , @entity45 general secretary , said : ' the death of @entity0 is another sad reminder of the need for better dangerous dogs laws			1
under the @entity48 , dog owners can not be prosecuted if their animal attacks someone on private property			0
this has raised controversy , especially when it comes to the case of police officers who are attacked by dogs when making an arrest in a suspect ’s home and the owner escapes prosecution			2
postal workers , nurses and social workers , who are all lawfully entitled to be on private property , are also affected by the rules			0
four children and one adult were killed in dog attacks in private homes between 2007 and 2010			2
the number of injuries has more than doubled from 2,915 in 1997 to 6,118 in 2010			0
currently , the law says only owners can only be prosecuted if a dog attack occurs on public land , not in places such as in family homes			0
the @entity108 launched a ‘ @entity113 ’ campaign to change the law to cover attacks on private property			0
@entity114 and @entity115 have already introduced new improved legislation and @entity117 is legislating in the current session			0
' the private property issue is again highlighted in this case			0
although it may not be appropriate to prosecute the daughter for her mother ’s death – she will be suffering all sorts of agonies over the loss of her mother – it could have been necessary under different circumstances			2
' if a person is killed by dogs on private property there is almost no chance of prosecuting the owner and getting compensation for victims , regardless of the recklessness of the dog owner and the viciousness of the attack			1
' he added : ' this government has procrastinated and steadfastly refused to act on the issue of dangerous dogs while people continue to suffer serious injuries and lose their lives in dog attacks			2
' police and paramedics were called after neighbours described hearing ' hysterical screaming and barking ' from mrs @entity21 's garden			1
five dogs were later seized from the semi-detached property , and it was revealed that mrs @entity0 had had a heart attack as the animals set on her			1
it is not yet known if she suffered a heart attack before or during the attack			0
a post mortem examination is expected to be carried out later today			0
@entity164 , a friend and neighbour of mrs @entity0 , was alerted to the attack when he heard her daughter mrs @entity21 screaming ' @entity168 ' outside the house			1
mrs @entity0 lived next door to her daughter , with her granddaughter , who has a baby of her own			1
the family has run @entity5 's pie and mash shop in nearby @entity7 , for several generations			0
mrs @entity21 lives with her husband , @entity180 , and her other three children			0
the couple own the dogs together			2
mr @entity164 , 65 , said he had long been afraid of the family 's dogs , describing them as ' vicious '			2
dog attack : mrs @entity0 ( centre ) with daughters @entity190 ( left ) , and @entity191 ( right ) ' i would see the dogs being walked in the park but i did n't want to walk near them , ' he said			1
' they were vicious dogs – you knew by how they pulled on the lead and you could hear them barking from my house			2
neighbour : @entity203 said he heard screaming but assumed it was one of @entity21 's children ' there were so many dogs something like this was bound to happen			1
' another neighbour , @entity203 , described hearing screams from mrs @entity21 's house at 5:15pm but mistook the noise , thinking it had come from one of mrs @entity0 's grandchildren			1
accountant mr @entity203 , 65 , who lives in the other house next door to mrs @entity21 , described hearing ' hysterical screaming and barking ' as he watched television			1
he only became aware of the attack when a police officer told him about it , explaining that mrs @entity0 was alone in the house when she went to feed the dogs			1
he said officers had told him it was mr @entity228 who discovered mrs @entity0 's body			1
mr @entity203 described the two mastiffs as ' real muscle dogs ' with ' enormous chests ' , and said the animals had a ' pack mentality '			1
he added : ' if one jumped on you it would certainly knock you over			0
' he revealed mrs @entity21 also owned cats and that one of them was killed a few weeks ago after the dogs began playing with it			1
he said : ' about two months ago they had this white cat which died			1
' the cat used to sleep with the dogs and one of these dogs started to playfully toss it in the air			2
they have a pack mentality - so the others started doing it too			0
' it survived initially and they wrapped it in a blanket , but it later passed away from shock			0
they are not the sort of dogs you would want to mess with			2
' he described mrs @entity0 , a widow , as a ' fit old bird ' who talked to all the neighbours and enjoyed gardening			2
she had lived on the street with her husband @entity269 for 40 years , until he died five years ago			0
@entity270 said her daughter and her family moved into the house next door the year after mr @entity276 's death			1

scene : police have cordoned off the @entity32 home where mrs @entity0 died last night scene : the back garden of @entity0 ' daughter @entity21 where it is believed the five dogs attacked her tragedy : dog baskets and food bowls can be seen in the garden at the scene where @entity0 may have been mauled to death by the animals animals removed : police have seized the two @entity26 mastiffs , the @entity29 bulldogs and the mongrel and are in police - approved kennels pending the post-mortem another neighbour , who did not wish to be named , said : ' the dogs were always barking , everyone around here will tell you that			1
' they had always had dogs but never any that big			0
they were not the sort of dogs i would have around children , let me put it that way			0
' two years ago @entity319 , 52 , was mauled to death by an eight stone @entity321 in @entity322 , south @entity33			1
the dog had been kept in a cage seven inches shorter than its body			0

in january @entity333 , 83 , died after he was mauled by a ' pitbull - type ' dog that had broken out of his neighbour 's garden in @entity339 , @entity340			2

' he added that an investigation was under way to establish the cause of death , and said the woman had sustained a ' number of injuries '			0
