@entity1 manager @entity0 has seen a reaction from goal - shy @entity3 after dropping him in the league for the first time			1
the 29 - year - old striker enjoyed a dream start to life at @entity9 's after moving from @entity10 in a reported £ 9million summer deal			2
@entity3 scored nine goals in his first 12 matches for @entity1 in all competitions and netted the winner on his debut for @entity17			1
@entity3 ( 19 ) has struggled with form recently and was n't happy at being dropped for the first time the goals have dried up of late , though , and he was replaced in the starting line - up by @entity22 in sunday 's 1 - 1 draw at @entity24			1
@entity3 ran straight down the tunnel at the final whistle , having played the final few minutes , and @entity0 hopes the striker can end his three - month wait for a @entity30 goal when @entity31 visit this weekend			1
' there has been a little bit of a reaction , yes , because nobody is happy to stay on the bench , ' the @entity1 boss said			1
@entity0 ( centre ) says he 's ' seen a reaction ' from @entity3 after leaving him on the bench against @entity24 ' sometimes you need a reaction off the player in that situation			1
' in that game , in that moment , i think it was good to change the way of playing with more fast players up front			0
saturday we play at home			0
' @entity0 has no fresh injury worries to contend with against @entity31 , with @entity53 coming back into contention after missing last week 's match through injury			2
@entity58 's relegation - threatened side head to @entity9 's buoyed by last weekend 's shock win over champions @entity60 and having overcome @entity1 1 - 0 earlier in the season			2
' yeah , they beat us but it was n't a very good game that day and we missed a penalty , ' @entity0 said			2
the targetman was in superb form at the start of the season and scored nine goals in 12 matches ' it was a stupid goal against us but , of course , we analyse always the opponent and we play 11 against 11 and then one team is playing like @entity31			0
' sometimes it is difficult to prepare a training session for the match , but we expect an aggressive opponent who will press us with direct play			0
' that is always difficult because they do n't give you time to play and you have to that and you have to prepare for that			0
' saturday 's match will be their last before a two - week international break , during which time many of @entity1 's players will be away with their national teams			1
@entity92 ( left ) was linked with a loan move to the @entity1 next season but @entity0 denied the claims @entity97 duo @entity96 and @entity98 are amongst those players , with some eyebrows raised by the fact left - back @entity102 did not join them in @entity106 's squad			1
' i am not surprised , ' @entity0 said			2
' he had suspension for three games			0
after that he came back and is playing well			0
' i think he played very well against @entity24 but i am not surprised because his time will come if he keeps working like this , keeps playing like this			0
' the 16 - year - old signed for @entity114 from @entity116 side @entity115 and big things are expected meanwhile , @entity0 downplayed speculation linking @entity1 with a loan move for talented @entity114 teenager @entity92			1
' it is not my job to do scouting of young players , ' he said of the 16 - year - old @entity116 midfielder			0
' he moved to @entity114 - that means that he is a very good player			0
