the captain of the missing @entity3 jet is nothing more than a geek who took his work home with him , investigators have today revealed			1
police officers probing the disappearance of flight @entity11 said they do not believe the captain had practised sabotaging his own aircraft on his own flight simulator			1
speculation had been rife that captain @entity17 had spent time on his flight simulator at home in @entity21 , working out how to make the @entity22 777 ' invisible ' after it took off bound for @entity24 on march 8			1
the same applied to the captain 's computer , it was claimed			1
with nothing lurking on either device that raised alarm bells , the discovery appears to corroborate the protests by 53 - year - old @entity11 's family and friends that he was noting more than a ' tech geek ' who loved flying so much , that he took his work home with him			1
the claims only serve to deepen the mystery of what happened to the aircraft as the search enters its twelfth day , spanning an area the size of @entity57			0
if , as sources claim , the flight simulator and the captain 's computer are free of any suspicious material , it diverts suspicion from him , but does nothing to solve the mystery of what else could have caused the plane to suddenly turn in a westwards direction , towards the @entity68			1
@entity70 prime minister @entity69 today said someone with a high degree of flying skills had deliberately disabled the communication system			2
investigators retrieve deleted files from captain @entity11 's home flight simulator which allegedly showed him rehearsing a landing on a small runway after flying above the southern @entity81 as suspicion shifts away from captain @entity11 ( right ) , police officers are said to be refocusing on co-pilot @entity11 ( left ) whose last words before communication with the aircraft was lost were ' all right , good night ' but with the evidence appearing to point the finger away from the captain , suspicion is set to fall back on to co-pilot @entity11			1
the 27 - year - old 's last words before all communication with the aircraft ceased , were ' all right , good night ' - which is not a normal sign off			2
some experts have suggested that late at night , flying over a ‘ quiet region ’ , like the @entity98 , pilots do sometimes chatter idly over their radios			2
he revelation comes as a satellite image appeared to show the missing plane in the skies above an expanse of jungle			2
the image is taken from @entity107 , the map search website currently being used by hundreds of thousands of people in an attempt to search for missing passenger plane , was posted on @entity112 on sunday			0
the authenticity of the photo has not yet been verified and the region depicted in the photo is as yet unknown			0
intriguingly , the plane appears to have been painted white			0
a satellite image provided by @entity107 , an online map website , appears to show a passenger plane in jungle spotted : @entity123 military say they picked up an unidentified aircraft on radar bearing off the flight path , heading left over @entity70 and towards the @entity68 the image was found by an university student in @entity129 , according to @entity129 's @entity130			1
the image has surfaced at the same time as the news that @entity70 villagers claim to have seen the missing @entity3 jet flying over the north east of the country at around the time the aircraft is thought to have made a ' u-turn '			1
at least nine people - tuna fishermen , farmers and villagers - in the @entity70 state of @entity144 have made reports to police about seeing lights in the sky and some said they heard the loud noise of an engine			1
these accounts appear to match the conclusions of investigators who say the jet flew low to avoid radar after making a sharp turn and heading west from its course over the @entity98			2
investigators told the @entity161 that they were now convinced the aircraft flow low over the village , which is in the north east - exactly the same area where the villagers and fishermen who saw bright lights in the sky and heard noises on the night the jet vanished are living			1
the missing plane , considered history 's worst aviation disaster , went missing on march 8 with 239 people on board ' @entity177 ' , as illustrated here , is a technique used by pilots to avoid radar detection investigators told a @entity70 newspaper that the @entity22 had dropped to a lower altitude - under 5,000ft - to avoid ground radar , using the surrounding terrain as a sonar barrier			1
mr @entity186 , 29 who said he saw the light heading towards the @entity98 at 1.45am on the night the aircraft disappeared			0
lending credibility to the account by mr @entity186 is the claim by fisherman @entity193 , 55 , who saw a bright light streaking overhead at 1.30am on saturday , about 100 miles south of where mr @entity186 had seen the light			0
mr @entity186 told said the bright light was the type that aircraft use when taking off and landing at night - like a car uses its headlights			0
' i was walking towards the rear of my house when i saw the light , and wondered where it was heading to , ' he said			0
' the airspace here is like a highway for aircraft and they usually travel in routine patterns			0
' however , the light i saw was moving towards a completely different direction			0
it was going towards the sea , near @entity220 ( which lies to the south of mr @entity186 's home )			2
' another theory today examined the possibility that a fire on board , caused by a bomb hidden in the cargo hold among four tonnes of mangosteens - an exotic fruit about the size of an orange - could have downed the flight			0
an explosion could cause the cabin to lose all compressions and render the pilots unconscious before they were able to apply their oxygen masks			0
the theory is supported by one witness , who claims to have spotted an aircraft on fire over the @entity98			0
new zealander @entity246 , working on an oil rig off the southern coast of @entity245 , claims to have seen what he believed was an aircraft on fire at about the time all communication with @entity11 was lost .			2

suspicion fell on captain @entity17 when investigators discovered a simulator at his @entity21 home
but police officers are understood to have found nothing suspicious
the captain 's computer is also thought to be free of *incriminating* material
@entity263 diverts attention to co-pilot @entity11 once more
it comes as villagers report seeing a plane flying at low altitude
