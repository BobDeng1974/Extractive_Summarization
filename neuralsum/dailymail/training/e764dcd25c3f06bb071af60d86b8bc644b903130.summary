by @entity0 published : 12:12 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 06:30 est , 15 february 2013 warning : high court judge sir @entity1 says couples are n't getting married because they can not afford to buy a house together as well high property prices are deterring many couples from marriage , a leading judge has warned			1
family law high court judge sir @entity1 cited a survey that shows one in six couples do not plan to marry because they can not afford to buy a home			1
it also found that cohabiting couples were put off marriage by the cost of the wedding itself			1
instead they settle for other arrangements such as living together and are more prone to break - ups			1
he said : ‘ a new national survey shows three quarters of 18 to 24 - year - olds , and two thirds of people cohabiting , want to get married at some point			2
it is clear marriage remains a popular and cherished institution			0
‘ but when we ask people why they have not married they come up with a range of answers : the cost of weddings , waiting to be asked , not getting round to it , not thinking it ’s necessary , or the cost of housing			1
’ sir @entity1 is the founder of the @entity42 think - tank , which commissioned the research by law firm @entity45			1
the study of 450 people living with partners found 16 per cent do not marry because they can not afford a house			0
some people gave several reasons , with 40 per cent unable to pay for a wedding and 25 per cent saying marriage is unnecessary			0
a conference organised by the @entity42 will discuss a new survey which found that although most people want to get married , nearly one in five @entity58 couples say they have yet to do so because they can not afford to buy a home			2
sir @entity1 added : ‘ there is a real danger here			1
people can slide into ever greater commitments without ever making a decision to be a couple			0
‘ moving in together is , according to our findings , the key transition from being seen as boyfriend and girlfriend to being seen as a couple			0
‘ but living together was not rated highly as a way of showing commitment			0
‘ without such commitment , the build - up of constraints can lead to the breakdown of the relationship			0
’ danger : most people want to get married , but 40 per cent of couples in @entity58 are delaying because of the cost the findings add to evidence that high property prices have a dramatic effect on family life			1
the average age of a new mother is now almost 30 , with the cost of housing and mortgage debt thought to be key reasons why women are having children later			2
but he added : ' too many people are forced to delay marriage while entering into significant financial commitments and starting families and are ill - equipped to manage the risks this entails			2
the survey commissioned by @entity45 in collaboration with @entity106 found that 40 per cent of couples in the capital said they were delaying marriage because it is too expensive to proceed			2
sixteen per cent said they have yet to marry because they can not afford to buy a home together			0
nearly six out of ten @entity112 said they wanted to get married .			0

sir @entity1 said cost of housing is ' real danger ' to marriage
*claims* many settle for other arrangements which are prone to break - up
large proportion of couples say getting married is ' too expensive '
