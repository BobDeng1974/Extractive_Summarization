@entity1 , 28 , was fired by the chief of police in @entity2 , @entity3 , after just under a year on the town 's police force - an act he claims is motivated by racism			1
@entity1 was more used to drugs busts and violent robberies at his previous posting in @entity24 , @entity25 - but took a pay cut and moved to quiet @entity2 , which has just 11 police officers			1
however , before his probation year was out , @entity1 said he had become the butt of racist jokes from residents and his fellow cops - and was eventually fired for reasons he says are down to the color of his skin			1
the situation came to a head earlier this year , when he woke to find his car daubed with racist graffiti , seemingly prompted by fears he would sue over his dismissal			2
the vehicle , a @entity43 , was filmed by local news station @entity44 in the wake of the racist act			0
on one side , ' n * * * * r ' had been sprayed in huge letters			2
the other side read : ' @entity51 [ sic ] and pay '			0
he later told the @entity53 tv station : ' i 'm in fear for my life because i do n't know who in @entity2 is out to get me '			0
the incident , at the end of january this year , came to light again after the @entity61 published a long account of @entity1 ' time in @entity2 , detailing some of what he sees as racist treatment			1
' @entity51 cheif and pay ' : vandals sprayed a misspelled message on the right hand side of @entity1 ' car dissuading him from legal action			1
the other side reads ' n * * * * r ' he told reporter @entity72 that shortly after he started a member of the public played a practical joke on him by calling 911 to report a ' black juvenile ' driving a police car after they saw @entity1 on patrol			1
officers turned it into a joke , continuing to refer to him as the ' black juvenile '			0
he was also reportedly called a ' token black guy ' by colleagues , and feels his vacation requests were handled differently			0
he also said he was treated unfairly over a complaint that he used a local gym without paying			0
the allegation - which , according to the @entity90 , was later dropped , saw him suspended from duty			0
around the same time , @entity1 said , a white officer was subject to an excessive force complaint , but was allowed to keep policing the whole time			2
small town : @entity2 , a @entity3 town with a population of 8,000 , had never had a black cop before @entity1 ' token black guy ' : @entity1 says that fellow officers picked on him and that he was given harsher treatment than other officers by his superiors a letter sent to @entity2 police by @entity1 's attorney also said that after he left the force , the chief of police , @entity108 , ' slandered ' his former employee when asked for references by other forces			1
it claims he ' prevented him from future employment as a police officer			2
' @entity108 said he could n't comment on that allegation due to the impeding legal case			0
however , the initial letter confirming that @entity1 would be fired cited ' unsatisfactory performance '			2
other reasons suggested include filing incomplete reports , taking too long responding to an important traffic stop , going home while on duty and not helping an officer in a ' physical altercation '			0
allegations : included in a $ 5million lawsuit is an allegation that @entity2 police chief @entity108 ' slandered ' @entity1 and stopped him from getting new jobs according to the @entity61 , @entity1 has now filed a suit demanding $ 5million from @entity2 - a figure which is more than double the town 's annual budget and would equal a payout of around $ 625 from every single resident			1
the vandalism of @entity1 ' car , which is being investigated by a different force to avoid conflicts of interest with @entity142 , remains unsolved			0
@entity143 has contacted @entity1 and @entity142 for comment .			0
