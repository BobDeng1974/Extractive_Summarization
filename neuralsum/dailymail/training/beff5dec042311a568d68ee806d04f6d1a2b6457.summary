residents of one @entity2 city will soon be drinking recycled sewer water as drought conditions reach critical levels			1
three years ago , 88 per cent of @entity2 was in the ' exceptional drought ' category - the worst drought in its history			2
today , just one per cent of the state is in that category , including the northern city of @entity13			0
the emergency water reuse pipeline process in @entity13 has been on the cards since 1999 , but as the city entered its fourth years of drought , officials realized it was time to roll it out			2
scroll down for @entity21 dust bowl : the dried and cracked bed of @entity24 , the main water source of @entity13 dry dock : a dock made to fish from stands completely out of water at @entity30 near @entity13 , @entity2 @entity13 may bring to mind flowing waterfalls and limpid pools , but its main water source , @entity24 , is a dustbowl at just 27 per cent of its capacity			1
the city is currently at stage four : drought disaster , meaning extreme water restrictions are in place			1
restrictions have brought the city 's water usage down from 50 million gallons per day to 12 million gallons each day , but the savings are n't enough and city officials have now decided that recycling waste water is the only way to keep the city hydrated			1
the city is currently in the midst of a 45 - day test period of turning waste water into drinking water			2
it 's pumped through a black pipe that runs through the city directly from the water treatment facility to the water treatment plant , where it undergoes four stages of purification			1
@entity13 water tower : water restrictions are so severe in the city that most residents rely on bottled and filtered water desert - like : the bed of @entity24 is a graveyard for fish and other life that once thrived in its waters once the testing is complete , the results will be sent to the state environmant quality department , which will deem whether or not it is fit for human consumption			1
public utilities operations manager @entity78 told @entity79 , ' we evaluated the waste - water first to see what kind of quality we would be dealing with			0
the wastewater quality coming out of that plant was very high , so we did n’t have a lot of things to deal with			0
' according to @entity88 , @entity13 will be the first city in the world to blend 50 per cent lake water with 50 per cent waste water to use for drinking water			1
' no one 's taken treated effluent from a waste water plant before it enters into a stream			2
no one 's captured that and used it as a drinking water source , ' says public works director @entity101 told @entity88			2
desert - like : the bed of @entity24 is a graveyard for fish and other life that once thrived in its waters dried up : @entity13 has been in ' exceptional drought ' for three years pipe dreams : a black pipeline runs through town taking water from the treatment plant to the recycling facility usually , waste water is treated and released back into the environment			1
water to be used for human consumption is then drawn from lakes and reservoirs and treated in much the same way before it comes out of the tap			0
according to @entity123 , repeated studies have show that many people have an aversion to consuming water they know has once been in a toilet bowl			0
the ' flush to faucet ' factor applies even when people know the water has been treated and is just as clean as bottled water			0
however , as the drought grows more and more intense in @entity13 , residents are just relieved to know that there will be water coming from somewhere			0
' i ’m happy about it because we ’re concerned here about our water levels and whether or not we ’re going to have water , ' @entity141 told @entity79			0
if approved , the program could be in effect by april .			0

@entity13 is entering its fourth year in ' exceptional drought '
the city 's main water source , @entity24 , is at just 27 per cent capacity
residents are living with extreme water restrictions
city officials are testing a water recycling program that will see waste water pumped from a treatment plant to a purification facility and back to homes
@entity13 residents could be drinking recycled waste water by april
