by @entity0 published : 04:50 est , 18 august 2013 updated : 08:00 est , 18 august 2013 a mother of three today claimed she was told to put on her school uniform and sexually abused as a child by a top @entity5 actor			0
the woman - who is now aged 39 , but was 15 at the time in 1989 - said the tv star even recited the @entity8 while they were lying on the floor			1
she told police last year and prosecutors said although there was enough evidence to proceed , a legal loophole meant the alleged attacker could only be charged up to a year after the incident			1
abuse claim : the woman is now aged 39 but was 15 at the time of the incident in 1989 ( posed by model ) the woman , who lives in the @entity24 and can not be named for legal reasons , said she met the man in a theatre and he told her how ‘ sexy ’ she was , shortly before she started at a boarding school			1
the man said the school was near his parents ’ house and he would take her out			2
she then called him in october 1989 after starting at the school , and he said it would be ‘ nice ’ if she wore her uniform			2
they met in the local town centre and he allegedly drove her to his home where he gave her wine , before they had sex			1
he later dropped her back and said ‘ see you soon ’ , she claimed			0
the woman , who is a civil servant , told the @entity44 : ‘ i ca n’t remember what we spoke about as we sat in the living room but it was there , on the floor , that we had sex			1
report : the twice - divorced woman told @entity54 ( file picture of one of the force 's police stations ) about the incident 24 years later , before they handed over the case to the @entity61 ‘ it happened fairly quickly and i was compliant and just let him get on with it			1
it was clear he knew what he was after			0
as we had sex he recited the nursery rhyme			2
’ ' i ca n’t remember what we spoke about as we sat in the living room but it was there , on the floor , that we had sex ' the twice - divorced woman - who first married aged 18 and has attempted suicide twice - eventually told @entity54 about the incident 24 years later , before they handed over the case to the @entity61			1
the actor denied the allegations when questioned by officers , but the @entity61 told the woman in a letter that it was ‘ entirely satisfied the sexual assault took place as you described ’			1
however , it added that the charge would have been under the @entity90 - and could only have been made against the man if proceedings had started within a year of the allegation			2
decision : she eventually made a complaint when @entity97 was exposed as a predatory paedophile in 2012 the @entity61 said this law was only relevant to incidents alleged to have taken place before 2004			2
but if there was sufficient evidence that there was no consent to the act , rape could be prosecuted			0
' it happened fairly quickly and i was compliant and just let him get on with it ' the woman met her current partner in 2010 and only revealed the abuse to him two years ago after having to leave the room while they were watching a dvd featuring the actor			0
he told her to tell police , but she did not want to at the time			0
however she eventually made a complaint when the late @entity121 dj @entity97 was exposed as a predatory paedophile last year			0
she told the @entity44 : ‘ what he ( the actor ) did set the tone around my expectations of men and being used by them			0
he knew what he was doing and does n’t care about anybody else			0

woman says star recited @entity135 to @entity136
he allegedly took her to his house in 1989 where they had sex
@entity61 can not charge him as it 's more than a year since incident
