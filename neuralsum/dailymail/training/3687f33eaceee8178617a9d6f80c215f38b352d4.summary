by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 when @entity3 describes something as ' innovative ' and ' inspirational ' you sit up and pay attention			2
the @entity7 legend says ' cricket has changed for the better ' over the last 20 years			0
and he 'd know - he has witnessed first - hand how the sport has evolved			0
from @entity10 to @entity11 , hotspot to the batsman 's wagonwheel - the presentation of cricket has been changing constantly during the former @entity7 captain 's time at @entity18			1
crowds may have been disappointing for large parts of the third test in @entity65 – with just 4,784 spectators in attendance on the fourth day – but the viewers at home were still tuning into the action on @entity18 in their droves			0
since @entity18 first broadcast cricket in 1990 , when they covered @entity7 ’s overseas tour of the @entity76 , innovations to enhance the viewer 's experience have come thick and fast			1
cricket fans do not just watch a bowler running in and a batsman slapping the ball through extra cover any more – they can listen to the on - field reaction thanks to stump microphones , see how a spinner has managed to get so many revolutions on the ball with hi - motion replays and find out if an opener has nicked the ball through @entity93 analysis			1
the @entity18 punditry team includes six former @entity7 captains , several @entity97 cricketers of the year and @entity99 winners			1
between them they have : the commentary team includes : @entity103 figure : @entity3 anchors @entity18 ' coverage of @entity7 's international cricket both home and away on screen : @entity7 players form a huddle in the middle of the @entity48 pitch while a cameraman films them test : @entity18 pundit @entity34 ( left ) talks with @entity22 ( centre ) as @entity116 ( right ) looks on innovations : @entity118 ( left ) and @entity119 talk through issues on @entity121 during the third test @entity18 cover a range of different cricket matches including international tests , odis and @entity127 , as well as county matches			1
for just one cricket match , here is what is needed : the public face of the operation are the star - studded pundits who boast @entity135 , 33,440 runs and 1,694 wickets between them – including @entity141 columnists @entity139 and @entity142 alongside @entity3 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity118 and sir @entity25 – as well as the stats man @entity145			1
the pundits and production staff are well fed - they get an extensive menu at every ground , with the @entity48 providing options including prawn jalfrezi , with curry a favourite of @entity25 and the rest , as well as salmon or lasagne			1
each match alone needs more than 30 cameras , 40 microphones , 15 production trucks and 15 miles of cabling are placed around the ground and controlled by a crew of 80 staff			1
but there is one view cricket fans rarely glimpse - the sheer manpower that goes into providing the pictures			0
@entity3 – a veteran of 117 tests , including 32 as @entity7 captain – said of the operation : ‘ it is huge what goes on behind the scenes			2
' because of the innovations and the developments provided by the production staff we can be very forensic about pretty much anything			2
if you have someone like a @entity144 up against you , if you think " how do i steal a bit of a clue about facing them ? " you can view his action on screen in depth			0
that would have been – and now should be – an advantage			0
close - up : @entity18 use 30 cameras in order to provide as many angles and slow - motion replays as possible pricey : for cricket coverage @entity18 use this state - of - the - art truck ... the most expensive in @entity198 wires : hundreds of cables are attached to @entity18 's new broadcast truck used during the third test view : the truck is home to 78 different tv screens which each show a different feed of the match on show : the director chooses from the different feeds what will be shown next on @entity18 's coverage ' @entity214 ( the @entity214 ) has helped to change the game on the field as well as for the viewers back home – we just have this strange situation where the @entity221 can opt out of it , but we can still use it in the studio and it has definitely moved the game forward			1
' holding , the former @entity225 fast bowler who was nicknamed the ' @entity226 ' , was equally as effusive of @entity18 's development of cricket			1
in his famous @entity230 twang , @entity118 explained : ' having all the information we get now can not do the players any harm – if they do n’t want to use it then ignore it			0
' the most important thing for me as a former bowler is the wagon wheel which shows where a batsman scores his runs			0
that would have really helped me to decide where to bowl to them to starve them of runs and it is a great innovation			0
' decisions on which pictures from the 30 camera feeds and the various gadgets used will be broadcast to the viewer next are decided from inside an £ 8m truck – the most expensive on the road in @entity198 – using 78 screens			2
in some ways the lavish expenditure on the production of cricket appears vulgar , but viewers want innovations , and in a world where budgets keep increasing and the likes of @entity268 are competing for every sport going , it makes sense to try and eek out every little bit to highlight how the coverage is different			2
@entity18 has broadcast cricket since 1990 – when they showed live coverage of @entity7 ’s tour of the @entity76			1
it has developed its production over time and the director ’s truck which is the most expensive truck on the roads in @entity198			0
here are some of the main innovations since cricket started on @entity18 : 1990 – stump microphones 1991 – stump cameras 1999 – widescreen 2000 – interactivity ( red button options ) 2003 – helmet - cams and player mics 2004 – umpire mics 2004 – ultra-motion replays 2006 – hi - motion replays 2006 – high definition 2007 – hot spot analysis 2008 – @entity297 2009 – @entity298 2010 – 3d international cricket 2011 – @entity301 cricket 2013 – @entity302 @entity44 : holding ( left ) and @entity119 ( right ) talk through issues on @entity121 in front of the cameras angles : members of the 80 - strong production staff trawl through footage to provide replays and analysis former captain @entity143 is the newest member of the punditry team - having made the switch from the playing field to the commentary box			1
he said : ' i played with some of the guys before i came here but walking in on the first morning and being like : " hi guys , you are the people who have been criticising me for the last six years , nice to work with you " , was a bit strange			0
' everyone feels a little bit sheepish but it is very much a team environment in the commentary box			0
' every cricket team now has an analyst so they will be putting together packages from all of the new technology - it really has taken the game forward unbelievably over the years			0
' talkative : @entity141 and @entity18 pundit @entity139 during commentary of the test match in the middle : @entity34 ( second right ) interviews @entity7 captain @entity22 ( right ) after the toss long history : @entity18 have been covering live international cricket , both home and away , since 1990 analysis : number crunching is done behind the scenes to provide the commentators with facts and figures as @entity143 explains : ‘ we ( the pundits ) just do the easy work by chatting away – it ’s those guys behind the scenes who provide you with all your lovely pictures and graphics			1
’ cricket coverage has been revolutionised in the last 24 years and innovations will continue and the viewer ’s experience will improve further			2
who knows what the next new gadget on show will be			0
as @entity3 says : ' cricket has really been dragged into the @entity366 by @entity18 – who knows where they will take it next			2
' and who knows , maybe one day the @entity221 may even accept that technology - and in particular @entity214 - is here to stay			0
discussion : @entity7 captain @entity22 ( left ) talks with @entity18 pundit @entity119 ( right ) in front of the @entity44 all angles covered : analysis is provided pre-match , post-match , during the match and also online @entity377 : the 80 - strong production staff use top - end equipment to provide angles and slow - mos @entity18 ’ international cricket is part of an unrivalled summer of sport including @entity385 , @entity388 @entity387 golf , @entity390 tennis & @entity391 .			1
