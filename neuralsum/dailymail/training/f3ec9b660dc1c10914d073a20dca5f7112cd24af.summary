a @entity1 newspaper has risked a royal upset by publishing a photograph of the @entity5 ’s bare bottom			1
the picture was taken during @entity5 ’s recent tour of @entity8 when a gust of wind briefly caught her dress – and her flimsy underwear did not offer much protection			1
now tabloid newspaper @entity14 has published the image beneath a series of tasteless headlines			0
’ the breach of privacy comes less than two years after the @entity41 and @entity20 launched legal action against a @entity44 magazine that printed topless photographs of @entity5 on holiday			1
the latest photograph was taken as the @entity41 boarded a helicopter to @entity49 after an official tour of the @entity51 with prince @entity52 last month			2
the couple had been visiting @entity54 , a small community where 195 homes were destroyed in the worst bush fires in a decade , as part of a three - week tour @entity60			0
royal tour : the picture was taken while the couple were visiting the @entity51 in @entity8 in april incident : @entity5 's dress was blown upwards by the blades of a helicopter when the @entity41 and @entity20 arrived in @entity54 in the @entity51 as the wind from the helicopter ’s rotor blades lifted @entity5 ’s £ 295 @entity73 wrap dress , an opportunistic photographer captured the moment and touted it around international newspapers			1
it was reportedly sold to the ‘ highest bidder ’ after @entity79 papers refused to print it			1
first published in the @entity14 ’s sunday paper , it also appeared on its website , accompanied by crude captions			0
beside the offending picture were the words : ‘ thank the wind for the insight into the royal household			0
summer style : @entity5 in the £ 295 @entity73 dress she was wearing at the time ‘ on sunday , photos appeared which show our favourite duchess @entity5 , 32 , in the @entity8 @entity51			1
‘ the royal helicopter rotor blades swirled up the air so that @entity5 ’s summer dress began blowing upwards – affording us a glimpse of her beautiful bum			1
‘ never have we been so thankful to a helicopter for creating such a wind			0
’ the @entity41 and @entity5 have been dragged into a series of privacy rows with the foreign press in recent years after photographs were published of @entity5 in a bikini while she was pregnant , and topless while on honeymoon			1
in february last year , @entity109 and @entity8 magazines published photographs of @entity5 with her bump on display while she walked along a beach on the secluded @entity115 island of @entity116			1
and in september 2012 , the @entity41 and @entity20 launched legal action for breach of privacy against the publishers of @entity121 in @entity44 after it printed topless photographs of @entity5			1
a @entity44 photographer took the pictures on a long lens from a road , while @entity5 and @entity52 stood on the balcony of a rural chateau in @entity129			2
@entity5 and @entity52 ’s lawyer , @entity130 , claimed the couple had suffered a ‘ grotesque breach of privacy ’ and felt ‘ violated ’ during a ‘ highly intimate moment during a scene of married life ’			2
it is also not the first time @entity14 newspaper has risked the wrath of the royals			0
in 1994 , it ran photographs of the @entity143 naked on a balcony while on holiday near @entity146 , in the south of @entity44			0
the images of @entity149 , with just a white dressing - gown draped over his shoulder , were taken by a @entity44 photographer using a long lens			0
the prince , who was 45 at the time , was described as ‘ hunky like a @entity157 statue ’ by @entity14			0
@entity20 of @entity21 is no stranger to @entity159 - style wardrobe malfunctions , and had struggled to control the hem of her red dress as she stepped off a plane in windy @entity163 , @entity164 , while holding @entity165 at the start of their tour last month			1
the @entity41 and @entity5 have been dragged into a series of privacy rows with the foreign press in recent years			2
above , the @entity172 , september 2012 ordeal : in 2012 @entity174 ( left ) printed topless pictures of @entity5 , while in 2013 @entity176 ( right ) in @entity109 published pictures of the @entity20 in a bikini while pregnant her navy skirt blew up in the breeze at a charity event in @entity182 in november , and she nearly revealed too much in a floral dress as she arrived at @entity185 airport in 2012			1
she also narrowly avoided a wardrobe disaster at @entity188 airport in september 2011 when her @entity190 yellow frock was caught by a sudden gust of wind			2
but despite a string of such incidents , @entity5 has yet to take a leaf out of the @entity197 ’s book			2
her majesty ’s skirts are always fitted at the hem with small lead curtain weights , which cost just £ 1.50 for a pack of four , to prevent the royal hemline from flying away in a gust of wind			0
a @entity206 spokesman declined to comment on the photograph last night			0
historic : the publication of the topless photos prompted the @entity212 couple to sue over their privacy for the first time - securing a ruling , pictured , preventing further distribution of the images			0

taken during @entity5 's recent tour of @entity8 when gust of wind hit dress
