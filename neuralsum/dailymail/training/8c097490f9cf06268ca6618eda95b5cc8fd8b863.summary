by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 does not believe @entity3 will fall prey to @entity6 's mind games this season			1
@entity2 knows only too well how @entity6 ticks following their three years together at @entity9 from 2010 - 2012			1
in what appears to be a clear battle of the @entity13 team - mates for this year 's formula one world title , @entity6 appears to have already started employing psychological tactics with @entity3			1
familiar sight : @entity6 ( right ) secured his fourth straight victory in @entity18 by pipping @entity13 team - mate @entity3 easy street : @entity6 's fourth straight grand prix win sent him top of the drivers ' standings winning team : mercedes have won all five races this season so far although victorious in the last four grands prix , @entity6 claimed at the end of two of those @entity3 was faster and he was lucky to win in the wake of holding off the @entity32			1
@entity2 is wondering whether @entity6 is trying to get inside the head of @entity3 and make him doubt his own pace and car			1
double duty : @entity2 was seen recently filming an advert for a sponsor ' i am sure there will - if there are n't already - be mind games going on			2
there were a few things he played on me , ' said @entity2			0
' it would work on some drivers , whereas others it just makes them stronger because they laugh it off			0
' @entity3 is intelligent to know if @entity6 is playing mind games or not , which in some ways could help @entity3 or harm him			2
he might just end up getting fed up with it			0
' but @entity6 is fully of confidence at the moment and he is a fierce competitor when he is like that , even when he is not having a good day			0
' whilst @entity6 may also be attempting to draw @entity13 ' focus on to himself rather than @entity3 , @entity2 is confident the @entity58 - based team will continue to deal an even hand to both of their drivers , as has been the case so far			1
' the thing is with that team is because they are going to walk away with it - i know we are only five races in , but they have such a big lead - they 're not going to favour just one driver , ' added @entity2			2
struggle : @entity2 finished 11th in the @entity18 @entity74 for @entity9 best hope ? @entity2 hinted that @entity76 have an outside chance of winning in @entity78 , with @entity79 finishing third in @entity18 ' they will let their drivers race because they need to keep the show going , and we need them to keep the show going and let both drivers race			1
' so there is no point trying to get the team behind you because they wo n't			0
i think they will be very fair , and they need to be for the sport			0
' with @entity13 dominating the year , with five straight victories and four successive one - twos , @entity2 believes @entity13 could yet make history and become the first team to win every race in a season			1
' i would be amazed if another car wins a race this year , ' remarked @entity2			2
' maybe @entity76 might in @entity78 ( next weekend ) because that circuit is not about power			0
but it is going to be tricky for anyone ( other than @entity13 ) to win a race , and if they do then they have done a bloody good job catching up			0

@entity6 has won four out of five @entity112 races this season
@entity13 team - mate @entity3 won opening grand prix
@entity2 admits 2008 world champion tried similar tactics during their period as @entity9 team - mates
2009 world champion would be amazed if @entity13 do n't win every race
@entity32 team led home one - two finishes in last four rounds
@entity2 warns @entity13 that they owe fans by allowing drivers to race fairly
