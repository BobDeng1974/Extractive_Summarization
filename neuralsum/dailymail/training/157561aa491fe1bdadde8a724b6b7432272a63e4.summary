it was probably just horse play , but a contestant suggested an answer on @entity3 that prompted host @entity4 to walk off the set			1
a contestant in a two - man team taking part in @entity9 blurted out ‘ riding a brown horse ’ - with just an ' n ' showing on the board			1
of course , the answer could n't possibly be right because that phrase needs two ' n 's			0
guessing game : a contestant suggested ' riding a brown horse ' after the letter ' n ' came up on the board nagging feeling : the next contestant suggests ' riding a white horse ' after the letter ' g ' appears the horse play is such that @entity4 decides he 's had enough @entity4 mockingly strolls off the set , with the audience in fits of laughter the audience burst out laughing and @entity4 said ‘ that ’s amazing , and it ’s wrong ’			1
next a ‘ g ’ appears on the board next to the ‘ n ’			0
unable to resist , the next contestants suggest ‘ riding a white horse ’			1
the audience are in fits at this point – and @entity4 , dumbfounded , mockingly strides off the set			2
he returns a moment later and asks in desperation : ‘ who said anything about a horse ? ’ it ’s by no means the first time that contestants have left @entity4 perplexed			1
exasperated : ' who said anything about a horse ? ' @entity4 asks when he returns earlier this year a contestant suffered the ignominy of making what some described as the ‘ dumbest guess ever ’ on the game show			2
he was faced with the following letters - @entity52 — @entity54 – @entity55 ’ - and asked to guess the phrase			0
it was possible of course that the pressure of television got the better of him – or he ’s just not a fan of golden oldies - but whatever the reason , the contestant , called @entity67 , blurted out the nonsensical ' @entity68 '			0
the correct answer is @entity70 , the title of rock and roll duo @entity74 ’s 1963 classic			0
@entity4 bluntly replied ‘ no ’ after hearing his answer , with @entity67 left looking slightly bewildered .			0

@entity4 left so exasperated on @entity3 that he walked off
contestants taking part in @entity9 blurted out silly answers
one pair suggested ' riding a brown horse ' after seeing just one ' n '
after that a contestant said ' riding a white horse ' after a ' g ' appeared
@entity4 mockingly strolled off the set in *disbelief* at the suggestions
