by @entity0 published : 18:14 est , 28 april 2013 updated : 18:14 est , 28 april 2013 @entity1 announces he would like to ' encourage ' wealthy pensioners to hand back universal benefits such as free bus passes , television licences and winter fuel allowances , calling them an ' anomaly '			1
this made me so cross i can barely type			1
@entity1 ( who manages on an income of £ 1,600 a week after tax ) lives in a mansion his wife inherited , sent his son to @entity16 and sits in a government packed with old @entity16 ( another joined last week making a grand total of 12 at the heart of power ) , who talk about comfortably - off pensioners as if they are a threat to the economy ! @entity1 , left , announced he would like to ' encourage ' wealthy pensioners to hand back universal benefits such as free bus passes , television licences ... and @entity0 , right , is having none of it there are two kinds of wealth in modern @entity32			1
inherited wealth , inherited houses , inherited trust funds ( ie the nest eggs of @entity37 , @entity1 and co ) and then there are the bank balances and shrinking pension pots which are the carefully stockpiled resources amassed by elderly citizens ( ie me ) who have paid tax their entire working lives			1
i 'm one of these baby boomers politicians find so irritating , simply because there are more of us than ever at pensionable age			1
my parents worked out of necessity			2
both were forced to leave school at 14 , and spent years studying to improve their chances in life			2
i grew up in half a terraced house in @entity57 , with an outside toilet			2
my parents impressed upon me the mantra of hard work , saving , and not being a burden to anyone			1
i have n't got an off - shore company , wealthy relatives who 've left me stocks and shares or nice houses in the country			2
everything i own i have worked for , paid tax on and i have no debt			2
if i am due a bus pass and a winter fuel allowance , then i shall be taking them			2
if i want to increase my contribution to charity as a result , then that is my decision , i do n't welcome a ' nudge ' from a politician			1
the government is full of rich men and women who have been privately educated , who send their kids to religious schools to avoid the local dumping ground , who have lovely country houses and staff we pay for via their expenses			2
they talk of mansion taxes but they cleverly minimise their own tax liabilities on their second homes			2
most have never done a day 's manual work in their lives			1
@entity100 — who lives in a swanky house in @entity102 , whose wife earns a fortune , and who holidays in a family ski chalet that is worth millions — has been attacking pensioner 's benefits since the beginning of the year			1
he claims that @entity37 ' will be punished ' by voters if the @entity113 sticks to his promise to protect universal benefits beyond the length of this parliament			2
@entity100 must be bonkers , because to attack pensioners is to commit political suicide			2
we are the only group who can be relied on to vote , who turn out in all weathers			2
never mind @entity37 's weedy concept of ' the @entity126 ' , it 's pensioners who volunteer , who look after their grandchildren for nowt , who visit neighbours and friends who need help			1
p ensioners are a huge asset to this country , not a bunch of spongers who need to be means - tested and denigrated			0
@entity100 talks of ' millionaire ' pensioners , but if your assets are tied up in your home , you 're hardly in the same category as sir @entity147 or @entity148			0
most pensioners work part - time ( if at all ) , live on fixed incomes , face rising heating and food costs			1
if they own a car , then the exhorbitant cost of petrol will be eating into their outgoings			0
i 'd like to know exactly who these ' millionaire ' pensioners are , because i think they are a figment of mr @entity100 's fertile imagination , an unashamed ploy to garner the youth vote			1
last week saw the unedifying spectable of @entity166 , minister for food , telling us to eat more leftovers and wrap up cheese to prevent it going mouldy , claiming households are chucking away food worth £ 50 a month			0
that statement , which takes the gold medal for unadulterated rubbish , comes from @entity32 's richest mp , worth an estimated £ 105 million , and who takes part in a bizarre ritual each year handing out loaves to the poor in his parish			1
@entity1 's equally unfortunate remarks about pensioners could n't have come at a worse time for the @entity187 , with the local elections later this week			1
invasion of the flaxen - haired muppets ! be very afraid after reading @entity192 's spooky the @entity191 ( filmed as @entity193 ) i had nightmares for weeks			1
night after night , an unsmiling blonde person with staring eyes would follow me around , blocking my path			0
now i 'm getting the same dreams , as our news media is full of strange flaxen - haired muppets			0
are the @entity202 ( above right ) the modern reincarnation of @entity206 's alien beings ( above left ) ? their blondeness , and overwhelming sense of their own importance sets them apart from us lesser mortals			1
they seem determined to bend us to their will with their ferocious mental powers			0
the children in the @entity193 ... who remind @entity0 of the @entity202 family when i ran into @entity202 at a party she announced loudly : ' you do n't like me , do you ? ' it was the first time i 'd actually clapped eyes on her in the flesh			1
@entity228 has talked up editing a minor magazine ( @entity230 ) into a major journalistic achievement - at least i 've edited a national newspaper			0
this miss @entity228 wrote about waxing her pubic hair for @entity234 , and has just penned a piece on modern manners , naturally featuring a very large picture of her favourite person - herself			0
@entity239 is a genius at self - promotion , and now @entity242 , their younger brother , has been appointed @entity37 's policy chief			1
time to be very scared			0
@entity242 , @entity228 and @entity239 forget publicity stunts for charity , just cough up @entity247 living in @entity248 rather blinds you to the real world			1
when i spent a year working there , i was the fattest woman at any event by at least three dress sizes , and shopping for jeans i thought i had strayed into a children 's clothes store as the garments were so tiny			1
in this rarefied atmosphere , movie stars get over-exercised about big issues — and expect us to take them seriously			0
of course they want to end world poverty , poor darlings , but do they have to tell us all about it via @entity267 ? @entity247 is going to spend five days this week living on just £ 1 day , participating in the @entity268 , to raise awareness of world poverty			1
frankly , it 's hard to imagine many people are unaware of world poverty , as we live in a world of mass communication			1
would n't it be better for millionaires like mr @entity247 to stick to their normal diets of organic tofu and expensive mineral water and just donate a larger part of their obscenely high salaries to help the poor ? @entity283 former @entity284 mp @entity283 has finally told us she had a facelift for ‘ maintenance ’ — she says she ’s not discussed it before because she felt it would trivialise female politicians			1
this is the same @entity283 who posed in a tight black leather skirt and revealing white blouse for a men ’s magazine			0
the same mp who dumped her constituents mid-parliamentary term , claiming she needed to be with her rock manager husband in @entity300			0
the @entity301 is full of married women ( @entity303 for starters ) who combine bringing up kids with the demands of a high - achieving husband and unsociable parliamentary hours			0
why the sudden revelations ? @entity283 has started a website @entity310 , which is full of advertising and pictures of — @entity283			0
on it , she promotes self - help books , exercise routines , and talks about her facelift , posting ictures of herself in skintight shorts at the trendy @entity322 music festival in @entity323			0
there is an intelligent debate to be had about cosmetic surgery — a review set up after the @entity329 breast - implants scandal has found that the use of @entity331 and fillers is completely unregulated , and women could be placing themselves in serious danger unless standards are imposed			0
the study recommended there should be a register of procedures , and an insurance scheme to protect customers			0
if @entity283 had remained an mp , this is the kind of legislation she should have been pioneering , to help other women			0
cosmetic surgery has been normalised — hairdressers and unqualified practitioners offer a wide range of treatments			0
@entity283 can describe her facelift as if she ’s a car going in for an @entity351 , but what if she ’d ended up with a droopy eyelid or crooked lips ? last week i had dinner with @entity357 , who berated me for not agreeing to appear on @entity358 with him last thursday			0
i had another engagement - but what is it about @entity362 and me that appeals to @entity358 ' producers ? we 've appeared together at least three times - perhaps the programme makers think we stand for two polar opposites			0
@entity357 is an excellent speaker , even if he dresses rather like a @entity370 ' estate agent			0
i gave him a lift to the station and was rewarded with a damp kiss on each cheek .			0

also , @entity239 's powerful *siblings* ...
... and @entity247 's charity work
