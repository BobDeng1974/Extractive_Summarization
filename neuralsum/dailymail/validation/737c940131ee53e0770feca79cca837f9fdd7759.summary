' i wanted to give people the chance to escape having to look all the time at @entity3 's urban sprawl and to create a multi-storey natural alternative ' , he said			0
the seasonal progression of the 150 trees planted around the property create a ' microclimate ' within the building , steadying extreme temperatures during the winter and summer months			1
each species of plants was chosen carefully to make sure there was a rich variety of colour and blossom depending on the time of year , and in total the trees are capable of absorbing close to 200,000 litres of carbon dioxide an hour			0
stand out : the striking development has its own ' microclimate ' inside , thanks to the trees planted around the project is also very environmentally friendly , making use of the latest developments in technology with heating and cooling systems that utilise geothermal energy with heat pumps , and rainwater is collected and ' recycled ' to water the green			1
mr @entity7 added : ' this natural absorption brings pollution protection only to residents , but in the city is also helping to eliminate harmful gasses caused by cars			2
@entity75 : the metal structures are designed to look like trees , which ' grow ' from the groundfloor to the roof ' i also placed the trees so that they can to a certain extent absorb some of the harsh sounds from the bustling streets outside			0
' ' the plants ' full foliage blocks rays of sun during the summer while letting in warm light during the winter			0
' the building has 63 flats each benefiting from the terraces and vegetation just beyond their windows and walls			2
' outside : architect @entity7 said while the wood filters the light in summer , in winter they allow light to filter into the house grand : natural wood is used throughout the property , creating a rustic feel			1
