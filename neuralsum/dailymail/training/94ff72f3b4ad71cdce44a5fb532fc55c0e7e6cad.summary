@entity0 feels relaxed rather than relieved after reclaiming the lead in the battle for this year 's formula one world title			1
in taking the chequered flag at the @entity5 , @entity0 claimed victory number 29 of his @entity8 career and his seventh of the season , two more than when he won his only title in 2008			1
championship rival and @entity14 team - mate @entity12 suffered his second retirement of the campaign - a wiring loom breaking in the steering of the @entity20 's car , leaving him without a number of vital functions ahead of the start of @entity8 's only night race			1
@entity0 celebrates after taking the lead in the drivers ' championship with victory in @entity29 @entity0 's @entity14 leads the field en route to an important victory that changes the balance in the title race as the field filed away on the formation lap , @entity12 was left on the grid frantically attempting to engage his car into life			1
it was to no avail , forcing his mechanics to rescue the 29 - year - old and push him into the pit lane , from where he managed to get going			2
but running 21st and last - @entity47 's @entity46 retired on the formation lap - he made little headway , even against the likes of @entity51 and @entity52			0
after 14 laps , as he pulled in for his pit stop , the team 's bid to change the steering wheel and coax his car into some sort of fighting mode ultimately failed , and with it came retirement			2
after a consoling hug from @entity14 motorsport boss @entity62 in the garage , @entity12 then watched @entity0 win to take a three - point lead in the drivers ' championship			1
@entity0 sprays second placed @entity69 after securing victory at the @entity71 it is only the second time this season @entity0 has had his nose in front , the other being for one race going into a highly - contentious @entity78			1
@entity0 said : ' i just feel relaxed			1
i came here to do a job , and i came through it without any issues on our side of the garage all weekend , which was a real blessing			0
' i also came here hoping to gain seven points on @entity12 ( the difference between first and second ) , with anything more than that a bonus			1
' of course , the extra points are a huge help , and you would think i should be relieved , but that 's not the case			0
at the moment i 'm not thinking that			0
' instead , @entity0 is more concerned with @entity14 ' reliability record that has now resulted in five mechanical retirements overall - three against him and two for @entity12			1
@entity14 teammate @entity12 could only watch after being forced to retire from the race that does not factor into account the brake failure which resulted in a crash in qualifying in @entity20 , nor the car fire in qualifying in @entity111 that was sparked by a fuel leak			1
' we 've had several @entity114 ( did not finish ) now on our cars , ' reflected @entity0			2
' i know the team will not be 100 per cent happy because we want to win collectively , to get those one - twos , to be the dominant team			0
' so by not getting that result they 'll be going back to the drawing board trying to figure out what happened			0
' they 're constantly coming up against things and perhaps other people are starting to be a bit more reliable than us , so that 's an area we can still definitely improve on			0
' @entity130 driver @entity129 was another driver forced to retire from the race , 8 laps from finishing @entity12 was despondent but philosophical as the fight now goes down to the final five races			1
he said : ' it was the toughest day for me this year , even worse than @entity138 ( where he retired with a gearbox problem )			0
' none of the steering wheel functions worked , so i had no @entity143 , the gears were all over the place , my brake balance was totally in the wrong place			0
sitting on the grid i felt helpless			0
' from a team perspective unreliability is our weakness and we need to get to the bottom of it and try and improve on that			0
' there was still drama for @entity0 to negotiate before he claimed his win with the deployment of the safety car on lap 31 after the front wing of @entity161 's @entity160 shattered across the track following a collision with @entity165 's @entity164			2
after six laps to clear the debris , @entity0 was left running on the supersoft tyre - but needing to make a final stop - whilst those behind were looking to go to the end on soft rubber			2
@entity160 's @entity161 prompted the introduction of the safety car after a collision with @entity164 @entity0 then wrung the life out of his car for 16 laps in a bid to come out ahead of as many cars as possible			2
he filed in between @entity181 duo @entity69 and @entity182 but on fresh tyres needed only one - and - a - half laps to take over at the front , from which point he stormed to victory , with the race reaching its two - hour limit after 60 of the planned 61 laps			0
second for @entity69 was his best result of a troubled year , with third for @entity182 moving him to within 60 points of @entity0			1
@entity130 's @entity129 suffered his first retirement for two years eight laps from home , whilst @entity51 was 17th and last in his @entity197 .			0
