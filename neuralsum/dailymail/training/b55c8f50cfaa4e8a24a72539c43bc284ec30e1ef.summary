@entity0 made a mistake by revealing @entity2 told him he was feeling tired ahead of @entity4 ’s game against @entity5 , according to former @entity4 and @entity7 midfielder @entity6			1
@entity2 has come under fire after he was left on the bench for @entity4 ’s @entity11 qualifier in @entity5			1
the 19 - year - old was replaced by @entity7 team - mate @entity13 in the staring @entity14 , but he came on in the second half and played his part in @entity4 ’s winning goal by winning the free kick from which @entity19 scored			1
@entity2 told @entity4 boss @entity0 he was feeling tired ahead of the @entity5 game @entity2 spent the first half of the game on the bench before coming on during the second half but @entity6 believes @entity0 would have been better to keep the conversation between him and @entity2 to himself			1

@entity2 played his part in @entity4 's win as he won the free kick that @entity19 scored from @entity6 won nine caps for @entity4 and worked with @entity0 during his time at @entity43 ' i 'm very surprised and if @entity0 could turn back the clock , i do n't think he would do it and say it the way he did because he has caused @entity2 a problem and he would n't want to do that			1
' and @entity6 , who won nine caps for @entity4 , does not believe that @entity2 deserves to be criticised for admitting he was tired			2
he added : ‘ the way he plays , with that power and that speed , he gives everything and he needs to be on top of his game , ” he continued			0
' if he is genuinely tired and he was honest for the team , then fair play to him			0
‘ let 's not make it a great deal			0
the lad has expressed it , @entity0 has made the decision not to play him and we have won			0
