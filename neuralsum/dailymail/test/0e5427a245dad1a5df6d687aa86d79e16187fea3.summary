the hunt for proof of the @entity3 's existence may be over - and it does n't lie in a blurry photograph			1
fossils of a creature bearing a ' striking ' similarity to depictions of @entity3 have been found in a 19th century collection			1
originally belonging to @entity12 writer and geologist , @entity14 , the specimens now sit in @entity15			2
he saw the resemblance and called for scientists to investigate the ancient creature			0
as part of research for the upcoming @entity36 , museum and festival teams went hunting for the origins of the fossil , belonging to a species known as @entity41 - or ' @entity20 ' as it has been christened			1
now researchers have revealed that ' @entity43 ' may have lived at the bottom of the lakes that would later become @entity23			1
the fish ancestor roamed @entity48 's freshwater lakes during the @entity49 , between 542 million and 251 million years ago			1
the creatures were some of the earliest known vertebrates to possess jaws , though they had grinding plates rather than teeth			0
great - great grandma ? @entity41 ( illustration pictured ) roamed @entity48 's freshwater lakes during the @entity49 , between 542 million and 251 million years ago the name ' @entity59 ' refers to the creatures ' odd wing - like appendages - ' pterichthys ' coming from the @entity63 for ' wing - fish '			1
it is believed that the ' wings ' led to the pectoral fins seen in modern fish			0
@entity69 , curator at the museum said : ' if you think of the picture that most people have in their heads of the @entity3 , our fossils pretty much meet what they would expect			1
' @entity41 lived at the bottom of freshwater lochs and had flippers to help it move around			1
' its head and back were covered in an armoured shell , showing that it was well - protected from predator attacks ; ready for anything			0
' in 2013 , this shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly having two giant flippers powering it through the waters of @entity23 was photographed by @entity95 's satellite map app. the image was studied by experts at the official @entity98 , who concluded it is ‘ likely ’ to be the elusive beast			2
elusive : a satellite high in the atmosphere , accessed using @entity95 's satellite map app , took this amazing image of a creature swimming below the surface of the world famous loch during preparation work for the @entity36 , dr @entity111 , an orthopaedic researcher and imaging specialist who is part of the @entity36 team worked with @entity69 on the history of ' @entity20 '			2
the investigations were undertaken as part of research into possible scientific explanations for the origins of the @entity3 ' it became clear that what we have here could be @entity3 's great granny , ' explained dr @entity111			0
' it fits all the criteria that people around the world associate with lake monsters , albeit a little smaller than popular images would suggest			0
' however , if we assume that this form of @entity3 would evolve in a normal fashion , then we can project how biological changes over the millennia might make it similar to the larger @entity3 we think of today '			0
tantalising : many hunters have claimed to have spotted the elusive loch ness beast - such this photo of its ' head taken in november 2014 - but concrete evidence has been lacking until now @entity27 , president of the @entity145 @entity98 said : ' this is fantastic news for all @entity3 fans			2
' we always said that the first sighting of the monster was by @entity150 1450 years ago - now we can say her family has been living in the area for 360 million years			1
' ' for the first time , visitors to @entity23 can be guaranteed to see a real @entity3 , notwithstanding that it 's one that 's a few years older than her relative that lives in the loch today			1
' no one is sure of what @entity3 actually is and the popular view is that she 's some sort of dinosaur - maybe she 's actually @entity43 after all ' ' @entity20 ' is available to view in the museum in @entity15 but visitors will have the chance to actually hold her during a lecture on the origins of the @entity3 on 7th may 2015			1
an online register lists 1067 total @entity3 sightings			0
the list was created by @entity27 , the man behind the official @entity98 and is available at @entity174 mr @entity27 said : ' @entity176 's photo bears an incredible similarity to @entity179 series of pictures and will certainly further stimulate discussion about this enduring legend			0
' among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in 1934 by colonel @entity185 ( below )			0
it was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants , @entity188 , who , on his deathbed , revealed that the pictures were staged			0
this famous photograph , produced in 1934 , was exposed as a hoax by one of the participants , @entity188 , on his deathbed a close - up of what could be the @entity3			2
the photo was taken by @entity199 in 2011 another renowned sighting was made in 2001 by semi-retired photographer @entity201 and his friend @entity202 when they were out fishing on the @entity3 this blurred picture , said to show the @entity3 , was taken by @entity205 in 1933 and published in the @entity206			0

fossils of a creature bearing a striking similarity to depictions of @entity3 have been found in a 19th century collection
it is thought the fossil was found in @entity12 and would have once lived in a freshwater lake between 542 million years ago to 251 million years ago
researchers have revealed that @entity41 - or ' @entity20 ' - lived on the bottom of the lakes that would later become @entity23
