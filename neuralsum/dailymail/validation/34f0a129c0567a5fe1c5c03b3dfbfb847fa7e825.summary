the @entity1 's chief executive , @entity0 , has ignited a storm of debate in this country and attracted global attention — for saying @entity7 's inability to win the @entity8 is ' unacceptable '			1
after a fourth consecutive second place in the championship , the man in charge of the union — and national coach @entity13 's boss — delivered a forthright verdict about the need to aim higher			1
among those objecting to his views was sir @entity21 , who argued passionately in these pages that the timing was wrong and that @entity0 had scored a ' massive own goal '			1
@entity1 chief executive @entity0 ( right ) chats to @entity25 at @entity7 's base in @entity27 in @entity28 @entity29 ( left ) , @entity30 and @entity31 leave the pitch following their 55 - 35 win against @entity35 @entity7 have claimed just one @entity8 title since their 2003 @entity38 triumph in @entity39 yet what was he supposed to say in the circumstances ? let 's be clear ; this was a damned - either - way scenario			1
imagine if @entity0 had declared that he found the outcome — another campaign without silverware — to be perfectly acceptable			1
he would have been widely castigated for failing to drive standards , for setting the bar too low			0
he would have been condemned for sitting on the fence and refusing to demand better			0
instead , he made it plain that he and the @entity1 are not about to settle for title near - misses			1
if it was meant as a suited boot to the behinds of the coaching staff , then it was unnecessary as they know precisely what is required			0
when @entity13 sat down to reflect on saturday 's 55 - 35 rout of @entity35 at @entity62 , he wore a despondent look			2
there was barely a flicker of consolation in the match result			0
he is well aware that anything other than first wo n't do			0
@entity25 ( second left ) consoles his players after they fell just six points short of a @entity8 title amid a raging discussion on this polarising subject on wednesday , some observers even questioned @entity0 's right to dip a toe in these waters at all			1
the thrust of the point from the dissenting voices was that he is in charge of the business and should leave @entity83 to run the @entity7 team			2
this simplistic outlook ignores the glaring truth : that @entity0 controls the appointment of coaches			2
soon after taking up his post he was the man who — following consultation with a panel of rugby experts — opted to give @entity25 the head coach role on a full - time basis , after his impressive interim audition			2
earlier this season , @entity0 authorised the agreement of new six - year contracts for @entity25 and his three assistants , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			1
so while he may not have the deep - rooted rugby knowledge to precisely criticise performances , he is an employer who must monitor the efforts of his leading employees			2
he is only one administrative step removed from the running of the team			0
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity25 talk in the @entity62 stands prior to @entity7 's clash with @entity114 in the rush to hand out bouquets or throw stones at the end of this year 's home @entity38 , @entity0 will be either acclaimed or damned by association with the @entity7 team as the man on whose watch the whole countdown and campaign took place			1
should his young coaching team and their squad fall short of the country 's expectations , the chief executive 's head will be above the parapet , so it is only right that he can voice his hopes and fears from time to time			1
that matter of expectation is significant			0
@entity0 does n't need reminding that the @entity1 are the richest union in the world and @entity7 have the greatest depths of playing reserves			1
with that in mind , to have won just one @entity8 title since the @entity38 triumph of 2003 is absolutely unacceptable			1
thus , what he said amounts to fair comment			0
@entity13 with his tight - knit coaching team of @entity101 ( left ) , @entity102 and @entity100 among the @entity153 nations in particular , the reaction to his post-championship verdict has led to yet more predictable and tedious references to perceived @entity156 ' arrogance '			2
this accusation is utter nonsense			0
it is entirely logical that a country — or a club , for that matter — with vast resources would have higher expectations and demands than those with less clout in terms of finance or personnel			0
look at football 's @entity171			2
the likes of @entity174 and @entity175 would aim for the title and consider anything else to be a let - down			2
it does not mean they have a divine right to win it , but their benchmark naturally must be higher than rivals with fewer resources			0
@entity186 , meanwhile , are heading to the @entity38 with back - to - back @entity8 titles so it is not arrogance for the @entity156 to bemoan a paucity of championship successes			1
in 2012 , @entity194 chief executive @entity193 outlined a strategic plan which included the target of winning a @entity197 by 2016 — and also the @entity38			1
at the time , he said : ' the goals we 've set reflect our ambition for the game in @entity202			0
with unity , and support from the whole nation there is no reason we ca n't achieve those goals			0
' the truth is somewhat different , but no - one dismissed this as @entity202 arrogance , just wishful thinking			0
@entity0 is not guilty of arrogance for demanding that @entity7 win trophies			1
he is also not venturing outside his remit			0
he is aiming high , as is his right .			0

@entity1 chief executive @entity0 branded @entity7 's second - placed @entity8 finish as ' unacceptable '
it was @entity7 's fourth consecutive second place in the championship
sir @entity21 felt @entity0 's comments were made at the wrong time
