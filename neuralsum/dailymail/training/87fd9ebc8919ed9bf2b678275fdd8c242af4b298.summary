while in hospital the family held a ' @entity82 ' for the babies before they died they also insisted that they are looking into improving access to communal doors at council - run tower blocks for the emergency services			0
council spokeswoman @entity90 said : ' the door entry system to @entity46 had no reported faults on the day of the incident and the city council procedures for access for the emergency services to blocks of flats were followed on the day that ms @entity9 called them			2
' the investigation has found no evidence that the city council could reasonably have done anything more that would have changed the outcome of this tragic incident			0
health and emergency services are separately undertaking a review			0
' this incident has led us to review procedures and we are exploring an improvement to access arrangements so that all emergency services will have keys which deactivate the communal door entry system and thereby giving immediate access			0
' this was a very unusual situation			0
@entity117 has confirmed that they are called to blocks of flats numerous times per week			0
' they are usually able to gain access to communal areas of buildings without difficulty			2

in response to the council 's findings , her father @entity132 , 54 , who works with adults with mental health problems said : ' they told us that this was the first time emergency services could nâ€™t get into a tower block , which i do find hard to believe			0
' we have been told that if they had reached @entity9 in time that the outcome would n't have been any different , and she would have lost the twins			2
' but she may not have fallen into a coma , and she could have seen the twins alive and @entity9 would have seen the twins had they got in quicker			2
' the council accept it has taken them years to realise that the ambulance rely on the public to let them get in these sort of places			0
' but they have been honest with their investigation , and something good has come out of this tragedy			0
