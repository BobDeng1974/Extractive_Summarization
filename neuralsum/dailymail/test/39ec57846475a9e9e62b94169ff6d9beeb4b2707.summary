an offensive attempt by a men 's magazine to commemorate fallen @entity3 soldiers has backfired as social media users and the @entity5 condemn the crude ' commemorative issue '			1

the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) said the word ' @entity14 ' is protected by federal legislation since 1920 and is not authorised to be used for commercial purposes - like @entity7 's ' @entity17 ' - without express permission from the minister for veterans ' affairs			1
the issue , released on the monday leading up to the @entity14 weekend , included a 10 - page feature with a list of ' 100 things every @entity30 should know about @entity31 ' and an interview with cover girl @entity33 who revealed what features she admired in our service men			2
in the interview ms @entity38 was asked what she liked about ' men in uniform ' , to which she replied : ' they 're bad arses , they have guns and they 're really fit and well built '			0
she then commends soldiers for ' doing what they 're told ' and being able to perform an ' impressive ' 100 push ups , ' in a row '			0
social media users were quick to condemn the controversial issue , labelling it ' gross and offensive			1
