doctors at a local government hospital tend to the one - day - old baby			2
tragically it was too late to save her the infant is put in an incubator at the local government hospital			0
she died the day after she was brought into hospital @entity78 is rife in @entity41 , as many families want baby boys to girls ‘ we were so shocked to see a baby moving , it was pretty devastating and we quickly informed the police			1
it ’s amazing the baby survived as the area is crawling with wild hungry animals			0
’ @entity78 is rife in @entity41 , as many families prefer having baby boys to girls			1
it ’s a nation wide crisis and recent figures have estimated that there are now 750 females to every 1000 males in the country			0
a @entity101 report in 2006 revealed that 10 million girls were killed - either before they were born or immediately after - by their parents from 1986 in @entity41			2

a @entity101 report in 2006 revealed that 10 million girls were killed - either before they were born or immediately after - by their parents from 1986 in @entity41			2
the practise is most prominent in @entity120 and the @entity4 states , where there are low recorded rates of female children			0
female infanticide , the act of killing unwanted baby girls , is a long - standing cultural problem across the whole of the @entity4 sub continent owing to the patriarchal nature of society			1
male children are preferred in the belief they will bring wealth and prosperity to the family while female children are often viewed as burdens			0
another factor is the dowry system , where the family of the bride give a large sum of money or valuable goods to the groom and his family			0
although the dowry system has been outlawed it continues to be deeply ingrained in @entity4 culture			0
families with several daughters can find the practise of paying a dowry a serious burden			0
female foeticide began in the early 1990s as a result of the availability in @entity41 of ultrasound techniques capable of determining the sex of an unborn child			1
as a result , 80 per cent of @entity4 districts have reported a greater ratio of male to female children since 1991			0
the practise is believed to have led to an increase in human trafficking with women being bought and sold as brides in areas where there are a greater proportion of men .			0
