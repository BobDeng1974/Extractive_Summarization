men who withdraw large sums from their pension pots should be forced to sign a waver admitting they know their widows could be left destitute , @entity0 has suggested			1
the @entity6 admitted that his new rules allowing people to take lump sums out of their retirement came with risks			1
but he said it was better to give people choice about how to use their own savings , even if some people ' spend the money too fast '			1
pensions minister @entity0 said it was better to give people choice about how to use their own savings , even if some people ' spend the money too fast ' the centrepiece of the @entity23 was a plan to allow people to withdraw their pension pot as a cash lump sum instead of investing in a pension plan , which ministers claim will give people choice to spend their money how they wish			1
under the changes workers nearing retirement will be allowed withdraw the cash they have built up in private pension pots			1
with no need to take out an annuity - paying regular sums for the rest of their life - pensioners will be free to spend their nest eggs as they like			2
if follows anger from pensioners about the dismal payouts that annuity providers offer			2
however , critics claimed the law was needed to stop people squandering their money because they do not realise how long they will live			2
at the time mr @entity0 said he would be relaxed if people used their money to buy a @entity52 , ' and end up on the state pension '			1
but speaking yesterday he conceded that people needed to be warned about the impact of withdrawing money from a pension pot built up over a lifetime of work			2
during a hearing in @entity61 , he asked the @entity62 : ' what thoughts have you had on safeguards ? my provider does their bit , tells me guidance is available , i do n't take it up , i then make a retirement choice			0
' do you think there 's a need for any second defence that i have to sign something that says i 'm married and i realise my widow will get nothing ? ' the pension reforms have triggered a political row erupted over trusting individuals with their own money			2
but mr @entity0 told @entity82 : ' yes , some people spend the money too fast , i 'm sure that will happen			1
' that 's the risk when you set people free			0
but we think the benefit of setting people free to choose for themselves is better than forcing them into a one – size – fits – all model , ' the @entity89 reported			0
when the pension changes were announced in march , mr @entity0 said he would be relaxed if people used their money to buy a @entity52 , ' and end up on the state pension ' @entity102 , the government 's tsar for older workers , said : ' there is a serious risk not enough people will actually receive the guidance			1
' i would like to see additional safeguards to protect consumers beyond relying on the guidance we already know many people may not take up			0
consumers have been left in the dark and at the mercy of providers for many years			0
' meanwhile , workers who leave their employer after less than two years ' service will no longer be pushed into withdrawing their pension contributions			0
from next october , the practice of ' short service refunds ' will be abolished , as part of a radical shake up taking place next year to help retirement savers build up their pension pots			1
under the current system , a member of an occupational pension scheme who leaves having completed more than three months but less than two years ' qualifying service may be entitled to receive a short service refund			0
sometimes this is optional , but in other cases an employer may insist on the refund being taken or a transfer being made to another scheme			0
the government intends that , from october 2015 , schemes will only be able to make refunds within the first 30 days of membership			0
defined benefit ( @entity148 ) occupational pension schemes and personal pension schemes are not affected .			0

@entity0 admits pensions changes carry risks if people spend cash
new rules mean retirement funds do not need to buy an annuity
instead they can withdraw all of the money saved in pension pots
