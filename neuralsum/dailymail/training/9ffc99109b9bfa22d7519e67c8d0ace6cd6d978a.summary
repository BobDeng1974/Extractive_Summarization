@entity0 and @entity1 scored centuries in a mammoth third - wicket stand as @entity4 wrapped up their one - day series with @entity6 with a convincing 131 - run win			1
@entity0 made 133 and @entity1 132 with the pair combining to put on 247 for the third wicket , a record for @entity4 in one - day internationals			1
despite only having 42 overs following a rain delay , @entity4 made 361 for five , a target which proved way out of reach for @entity6 who made 230 all out ; the tone of their innings set when @entity20 went first ball			1
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity1 ( right ) both scored centuries as @entity4 beat the @entity6 @entity24 ( left ) of the @entity6 looks on as @entity1 helped @entity4 to post 361 for five they plodded on , but when @entity27 took four wickets in two overs , they were blown apart			1
consequently , @entity4 take the series 3 - 1 and head to the @entity32 in good heart			1
after a rain delay that cost a little over two hours of play and eight overs a side , @entity6 won the toss and put @entity4 into bat , hoping for some difficult batting conditions early on			1
it appeared they had got their wish as they picked up early wickets thanks to some extra bounce			0
@entity46 went in only the second over , caught at point off @entity49 for just four , and @entity4 were at 59 for two when @entity50 went to another short ball , caught by @entity52 at deep fine leg off @entity54			2
but that brought @entity1 and @entity0 together , and they punished the @entity58 attack repeatedly with some huge shots			1
@entity1 's 132 - his second international century after his 128 in @entity64 10 days ago - included eight sixes and came off just 98 balls while @entity0 had six maximums in his 133 , which came off 105 balls			1
@entity6 ' captain @entity65 ( left ) shakes @entity0 's hand after his side were bowled out for 260 runs the partnership was finally ended in the 39th over as @entity1 pulled a short ball to deep midwicket where @entity72 snared the catch to give @entity54 a second wicket			1
two overs later , @entity54 got @entity0 too as the @entity77 opener dragged the ball on to his stump			2
@entity80 made a quick 23 off 16 balls - including two sixes - before edging @entity49 behind while @entity83 contributed an unbeaten 18 and @entity84 five before the 42 overs were up			0
faced with a huge target , @entity6 were going to need a big hand from @entity20 - but instead saw their hopes effectively ended when he was out to the opening delivery from @entity92			1
the ball was initially ruled a wide but @entity4 reviewed it , finding the delivery to be legitimate and @entity20 to have got an edge			0
without him , the @entity6 were struggling to keep up with the required run rate			0
@entity46 ( left ) of @entity4 looks on as @entity99 plays a shot during the odi @entity4 believed they had @entity99 out in the 12th over when he ducked under a short ball from @entity27 and reviewed the decision , but replays showed it struck the elbow guard and not the glove			0
they had a wicket to celebrate soon enough however , with @entity111 out in the next over , lbw to @entity112 for 31			0
@entity99 then lost his wicket to a horrible run out , going for 42 with @entity6 on 81 for three			2
@entity115 got a huge inside edge but though it missed the stumps , @entity99 was wildly optimistic in calling for a single and paid with his wicket when sent back by @entity115			0
@entity115 at least made amends as he hung around for a stand of 91 with @entity24 , their partnership ending when he was cleaned up by @entity123 for 50			0
@entity4 batsman @entity50 plays a shot into the open field during the match @entity24 followed four runs later , giving @entity27 the first of his four for 42 , with the same bowler removing @entity72 - caught at third man - for a duck in the same over			2
the wheels were coming off now and @entity54 nicked @entity27 behind for 24 , with the bowler 's hot streak then wrapped up by his snaring of @entity49			0
@entity65 - dropped on his first ball - at least clubbed a late 27 to take the score to what it was , but after @entity141 edged @entity142 behind and @entity65 was bowled by @entity143 , the game was up			0
@entity20 ( centre ) of the @entity6 walks off as @entity146 players celebrate dismissing him for a duck			2
