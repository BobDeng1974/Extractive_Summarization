by @entity0 nearly a year after @entity3 was found guilty of brutally murdering her ex-boyfriend , an @entity2 jury panel is being asked to decide the fate of another woman charged with an eerily similar crime			1
@entity9 , 36 , is accused of bludgeoning her husband with a hammer at their @entity13 , @entity2 , home in 2009			1
she told investigators that @entity16 , 34 , had physically and sexually abused her in the past , and that she killed him in self - defense			1
they say the 36 - year - old @entity9 has given conflicting accounts of her husband 's death and that people who the woman claimed had witnessed some of the past abuse did n't back up her claims			1
@entity16 died at a hospice nearly a month after the attack of complications from his head injuries			0
the case went to the @entity47 jury monday , two months after the start of the trial , and deliberations resumed this morning			0
@entity16 , 34 : he suffered multiple skull fractures at the couple 's home in the @entity55 suburb of @entity13 and died at a hospice nearly a month after the attack of complications from his head injuries @entity9 's case has been compared to the trial of @entity3 , who was found guilty of first - degree murder last may for slashing , stabbing and shooting to death @entity3 in his @entity64 , @entity2 , home in june 2008			1
like in the @entity16 murder , @entity67 claimed self - defense , accusing her longtime on - again , off - again lover of being abusive , @entity66 reported			1
and the similarities between the two women do not end there : the cases were tried in the same @entity77 courtroom , and both @entity67 and @entity9 could face the death penalty			2
with their long dark hair and eyeglasses , the two women even look strangely alike			0
it has been reported that the 36 - year - old @entity9 befriended the 33 - year - old convicted killer while the two were in jail together			1
in an interrogation video recorded just hours after the bloody attack , @entity9 could be seen chuckling as she recounts the events of the night , raising her arm in a motion mimicking hammer blows			0
â € ˜ i saw a hammer go into @entity94 € ™ s head , â € ™ she says with a nervous smile			0
prosecutor @entity96 said at the start of the trail in february that mrs @entity9 needed quick money to get out of her deep financial hole			0
but one of @entity9 's attorneys raised questions about the credibility of his client 's boyfriend , who was given an immunity agreement on child pornography allegations in exchange for his testimony			2
authorities said @entity9 fatally wounded @entity16 by bludgeoning him over the head with a hammer as he slept in their suburban @entity55 home in january 2009			2
disturbing : @entity9 is seen smiling while demonstrating for investigators just hours after the attack how the hammer ( right ) entered her husband 's skull key witness : businessman @entity123 , who was @entity9 's boyfriend , testified for the prosecution against the woman who owed him $ 300,000 @entity16 , 34 , suffered multiple skull fractures and died a month after the attack			1
prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against @entity9			2
@entity130 , one of @entity9 's attorneys , said prosecutors are giving a pass to his client 's boyfriend , businessman @entity123 , even after he failed to report to police that @entity9 had allegedly claimed three days before the hammer attack that her husband had been killed in a tire - iron beating			1
at first , @entity9 told investigators that @entity16 had attacked her while she was asleep and choked her until she was unconscious			0
she told police that when she came to , she saw another man who lived at their @entity13 home beating @entity16 with a hammer			0
but authorities say blood spatter showed @entity16 was alone in the bed at the time of the attack and that bloodstains on @entity9 's clothes were consistent with a person swinging an object repeatedly over her head			1
@entity9 , 36 : she claims killing @entity16 was an act of self - defense and told investigators that her husband had physically and sexually abused her in the past investigators say @entity9 later confessed , saying she attacked her sleeping husband in a rage after he had sexually assaulted her			1
police said they discovered @entity9 had been dating another man , @entity123 , for more than two years			0
in a search of @entity123 ' computer , police say they found a journal that appeared to be written from his perspective and indicated that he had given @entity9 about $ 7,000 , which she used to hire a hit man , according to court records			0
the prosecution said @entity9 needed to repay a $ 294,000 loan from her boyfriend			2
authorities said child pornography also was found on @entity123 ' computer			0
county prosecutors granted @entity123 immunity on that allegation in exchange for his testimony in the murder case			0

@entity9 , 36 , charged with first - degree murder in 2009 beating death of @entity16
she said years of physical and sexual abuse led her to kill husband
prosecutors said she killed him for the insurance money to repay $ 300,000 loan from her boyfriend
