by @entity0 published : 04:54 est , 1 january 2014 updated : 07:05 est , 1 january 2014 the @entity2 will undergo an overhaul that will nearly double its power and allow scientists to uncover more secrets about the way our universe works			1
it opens up the possibility of solving the riddle of @entity13 , finding evidence of a far - reaching cosmic concept known as ' supersymmetry ' , and even discovering signs of extra hidden dimensions that help explain the mystery of gravity			2
by the end of the year the giant atom - smashing machine should be ready to boost its particle energy from eight trillion electrovolts , or teraelectronvolts ( @entity25 ) to 14 tev - allowing it to perform the highest energy particle collisions ever attempted			2
behind the veil : upgrades to the @entity2 will hopefully allow scientists to make bold new steps in understanding the very ways in which our universe works a new series of experiments due to resume early in 2015 could take scientists into an uncharted realm of physics known as ' beyond the @entity38 '			1
it is currently shut down as technicians and scientists work on its upgrade			2
scientists may also uncover more @entity44 - different versions of the so - called ' @entity47 particle ' , predicted by @entity49 laureate professor @entity48 , that gives other particles mass. the higgs boson was the last missing piece of the ' @entity38 ' , a blueprint of interacting forces and elementary particles that has stood in place since the early 1970s			1
now scientists want to go further , beyond the @entity38 , to expand their theories about how the universe works			1
@entity13 , the cosmic concept known as ' supersymmetry ' , and even hidden dimensions could be laid bare thanks to the revamp professor @entity65 , from the @entity66 , a leading member of the team operating the giant @entity70 detector at the @entity2 , said : ' the idea now is that with the last missing piece of the @entity38 in place , the search now is for things that go beyond it , primarily suypersymmetry			1
' @entity77 proposes that for every matter particle there is a corresponding force - carrying particle as well			2
it requires not one but several @entity44 , providing new quarry for the @entity2 scientists to pursue			1
' the universe being driven by supersymmetry is a really key idea , ' said prof @entity65			1
' at the moment we separate things that are force carriers and matter particles			0
' evidence of supersymmetry would change our whole view of what 's happening out there			0
each of these particles would basically be the same thing , but one 's force and one 's matter			0
the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) is a gigantic scientific instrument near @entity104 , where it spans the border between @entity107 and @entity108 about 100 m underground			1
it is a particle accelerator used by physicists to study the smallest known particles – the fundamental building blocks of all things			1
it has revolutionised our understanding of the minuscule world deep within atoms to the vastness of the @entity120			0
two beams of subatomic particles called ' hadrons ' – either protons or lead ions – will travel in opposite directions inside the circular accelerator , gaining energy with every lap. physicists use the @entity2 to recreate the conditions just after the @entity132 , by colliding the two beams head - on at very high energy			1
teams of physicists from around the world will analyse the particles created in the collisions using special detectors in a number of experiments dedicated to the @entity2			1
' our world is made up of matter and forces and they are distinct , but at higher energy scales they would be interchangeable			0
that may have been how things were just after the @entity132			0
the real question is , can we probe that ? ' investigating supersymmetry may ultimately solve the riddle of @entity13 - the invisible stuff that glues galaxies together with gravity but whose nature is unknown			0
@entity13 could be composed of supersymmetry particles that ' just sit there , not doing anything ' , said prof @entity65			0
operating the @entity2 at higher energies may even offer scientists a glimmer of hidden extra dimensions , which in turn could answer unresolved questions about the nature of gravity			1
the upgrade will involve stripping the whole of @entity70 , the largest of the @entity2 's six detectors , which is more than 150 feet long and 82 feet tall			2
' originally we thought we could get away with not having to disassemble the whole thing , but that proved impossible , ' said prof @entity65			0
' this detector 's been sitting around since 2008 and there 's a lot that needs to be done			0
we 're taking it all apart and putting it back together again			0
' there 's a lot of radiation damage , because the @entity2 was running at much higher intensities than it was originally designed for			2
' other major work will be carried out on the ' ring ' , the 17 - mile long circular tunnel through which protons , the ' hearts ' of atoms , are accelerated to within a whisker of the speed of light			0
welds and joints on the powerful magnets around the ring will have to be strengthened to take the higher currents			0
in 2020 a further upgrade will see the @entity2 's energy levels remain the same but its detectors made 10 times more sensitive			2
the machine is expected to remain in operation until 2030			0

*enhanced* @entity2 could answer fundamental questions about the universe
scientists are hoping to uncover several more types of ' @entity47 particle '
it also allows them to explore the theory of ' supersymmetry '
