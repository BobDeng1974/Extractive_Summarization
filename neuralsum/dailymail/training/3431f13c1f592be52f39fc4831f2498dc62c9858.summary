' @entity41 was used and i - just like you , just like any reasonable person - asked why was this done , ' @entity35 said on @entity2 television when asked about the press reports			1
' because if they had n't been photoshopped , in order to make them resemble an image that the average person would recognise them in , then the photos would n't have been published in the first place			0
' the mug shot of suspected bank robber @entity56 ( left ) , 24 , and the photo published in the @entity2 media ( right ) , showing him with far heavier bruises he said police believed the injuries occurred when the suspects resisted arrest rather than when they were in custody			1
