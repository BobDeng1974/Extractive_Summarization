that makes the @entity21 rapper 's breakthrough hit nearly twice as popular as the second place clip , the music video for @entity6 and @entity25 's hit track @entity24			2
mass appeal : @entity27 in his music video for the track @entity10 , which is far and away the most popular video on @entity2 , the video - sharing website which has hit the one billion users a month mark oooh , baby baby : @entity10 has been viewed nearly 1.5billion times on @entity2 the only clip in the top ten not promoting a recording industry artist was the perennially amusing @entity39 - again ! , which was the sixth most watched of all time with nearly 520million views			1
no one artist had more than one video in the top ten and , other than the apparently universally appealing @entity10 , the only @entity47 language video was @entity50 folk singer @entity49 's @entity48 !			0
@entity2 announced it had reached the billion users a month milestone at a swish event last night aimed at advertisers and featuring performances from some of the website 's biggest stars			1

the vast audience - up from 800million a month in october 2011 - has given @entity2 's owner @entity82 another lucrative channel for selling online ads beyond its dominant internet search engine			2
@entity82 snapped up @entity2 for $ 1.76billion ( £ 1.16billion ) in 2006 when the video site had an estimated 50million users worldwide			1
@entity2 has since late 2011 refocused its site to prioritise watching along distinct channels of its creators			0
such channels were seen as better allowing advertisers to focus on certain genres of content like beauty or music			0
the company in 2012 ploughed $ 100million ( £ 659million ) into funding 96 channels to help them accelerate that growth , in many cases partnering with big - name @entity102 producers and directors			0
later , @entity2 vowed to spend another $ 200million ( £ 132million ) marketing the channels to boost viewers			0
but last night 's event focused largely on stars who made it big through @entity2 before the new channel - funding strategy , such as @entity110 , a video author who has been giving viewers make - up tips via the site since 2006			2
record - breaking : @entity2 says more than one billion people are now visiting its online video site each month growth : @entity82 ( ceo @entity117 is pictured ) bought @entity2 for $ 1.76billion ( £ 1.16billion ) in 2006 when the video site had an estimated 50million users worldwide @entity2 vice-president @entity120 , who is the company 's global head of content partnernships , admitted after the event that the channel funding strategy had not worked as well as hoped			1
asked whether the channel funding investment had paid off , mr @entity120 said : ' every year we reserve the right to get smarter			0
' while @entity2 was committed to continuing to invest in content , he said , more of such investment in the future would go to those channels that had already proven they can be successful at building an audience on their own			0
' what we 're looking for is the acceleration of those who are figuring out how to retail their content , ' he said .			0
