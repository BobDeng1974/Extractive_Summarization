that 's according to a new map created by @entity14 number cruncher @entity12 using @entity16 data			1
the redder a @entity20 county , the more likely that residents were born in that state			0
the whiter the area , the more likely that residents had relocated			0
demographics : this map shows the areas with a high concentration of original inhabitants ( red ) and those brimming with people from somewhere else ( white ) the map also shows that the western part of the country is lighter than the eastern side , suggesting more people migrate west than the other way around			1
given the strong influence of population density , @entity12 created a second map that shows the percentage of people living in each county who were born in the state in which they live			1
of the 24 counties with more than 90 per cent of residents living in their birth states , 11 are in @entity47 ( four ) and @entity3 ( seven )			0
of the 25 counties with fewer than 25 per cent of residents living in their birth states , five are in @entity51 ( not shown ) , five are in @entity6 , and four are in @entity7			2
@entity12 said there is a ' three in five chance ' of meeting someone in your @entity20 state who was born there			2

' as a native portlander who is now living once again in @entity74 , i find that fewer and fewer of my peers were born in @entity76 , ' he wrote on his @entity14			0
' most of my friends living here are from other states			0
' to investigate whether this was a coincidence or a reflection of a real trend , i decided to map the @entity16 data on the topic			2
' my suspicions about @entity74 were justified : in @entity87 , only 43 % of residents were born in @entity76 , which is well below the national average ! '			0
