for all the problems that @entity2 had during his year at @entity3 , you would n't associate his teams with defensive frailties and a lack of organisation at set pieces			0
and since taking over at @entity9 has enhanced his reputation as a manager who brings , if nothing else , solidity			0
in his 21 @entity16 games to date @entity14 have conceded just 29 times , climbing from the relegation when @entity2 took over , to an extremely comfortable tenth place			1
@entity20 diverts a corner past his own goalkeeper @entity22 who fails to punch it away @entity24 celebrate after going two goals ahead after just 10 minutes , killing the match as a contest @entity28 ( left ) is congratulated by @entity29 , but did n't celebrate against his former club @entity24 : @entity31 ; @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 ; @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 ( @entity40 81 mins ) ; @entity28 ( @entity41 90 ) , @entity29 ( @entity42 61 ) subs not used : @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 goals : @entity20 ( @entity49 ) 2 , @entity28 10 booked : @entity39 @entity14 : @entity22 ; @entity20 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 ; @entity53 , @entity54 ; @entity55 ( @entity56 74 ) , @entity57 ( @entity58 74 ) , @entity59 ; @entity60 ( @entity61 81 ) subs not used : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 yet , on tuesday night , @entity14 showed none of the qualities usually associated with their manager , capitulating inside 10 minutes against the @entity71 champions			1
by the time @entity28 struck the hosts ' second goal , lifting the ball over the hapless @entity22 after the keeper had parried @entity38 's shot straight to the @entity78 , @entity24 could have been four up , and the game was all but over			1
@entity39 had already seen his volley hit the post after being left totally unmarked from a free kick , before @entity20 diverted the resulting corner past his own keeper after little more than 90 seconds			1
soon after @entity28 narrowly failed to connect with a header after yet more shocking set - piece defending , and the @entity88 man also came close to tricking his way through the visiting defence , only to be denied by a last - ditch tackle			2
@entity2 looks on as his team showed uncharacteristic defensive frailties at the @entity94 @entity36 holds off @entity14 forward @entity57 as @entity24 took control and never relinquished it @entity24 's @entity96 star @entity39 , who struck the post early on , takes of @entity50 against a team who had n't conceded a single goal in their previous four games , it was suicidal			1
in response @entity2 ' side produced next to nothing			0
@entity60 brought a save from @entity24 's @entity108 keeper @entity31 which was comfortable enough , while @entity57 swung a leg at a dropping ball from inside the area , only to see it fly well wide			1
that was about all they managed until a free kick from one - time @entity117 midfielder @entity61 forced @entity31 into his first stretching save with three minutes to play			0
the champions , on the other hand , without looking particularly good , continued to threaten , helped repeatedly by @entity22 and his defenders , who seemed desperate to offer chances out of nothing			2
@entity36 was given the freedom of the penalty area from another corner , but could n't make contact with his volley , before @entity22 misjudged a wayward @entity38 cross , allowing it to land on his crossbar			0
@entity29 worked hard and offered a foil for the talented @entity28 before being replaced after an hour @entity132 calls for more for his team as they kept their @entity16 title defense alive the @entity137 stopper also flapped at a cross , allowing @entity34 an opportunity from close range , but the full - back saw his shot deflected wide			2
the win means @entity24 are only two points behind city rivals and @entity147 quarter - final opponents @entity148 , although @entity150 's side have a game in hand , and the defence of their title is not yet over			0
@entity132 was able to rest @entity29 for the final 30 minutes , after the former @entity156 and @entity157 striker had run hard , without much success , alongside @entity28			1
his side 's season will be defined in the coming weeks , while @entity2 ' early successes in @entity14 means @entity9 's campaign has already reached a successful conclusion , with survival assured			0
but his side 's defending will nonetheless have hurt the former @entity3 manager .			0

@entity20 own goal puts @entity24 ahead inside two minutes
@entity28 adds second after goalkeeping error
champions could have scored more as @entity14 offer very little
