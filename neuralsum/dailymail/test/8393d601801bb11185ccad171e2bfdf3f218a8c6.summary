@entity0 has discovered strange , multi-coloured veins on @entity2 that could give astronomers new insights into the red planet 's watery past			1
the mineral veins were found at a site called ' @entity9 ' on the slopes of @entity11 and stick up from the rock by up to 6cm ( 2.5 inches )			1
scientists believe the bizarre network of ridges formed in @entity2 ' wet past billions of years ago above the now eroded , much softer bedrock			1
this march 18 , view from the @entity18 on the @entity0 rover shows a network of two - tone mineral veins			1
scientists believe the bizarre formed in @entity2 ' wet past billions of years ago above the now eroded bedrock the ridges contain both bright and dark material			1
while @entity0 has found brightly coloured veins before , the darker ones remain have stumped scientists			2
' some of them look like ice - cream sandwiches : dark on both edges and white in the middle , ' said @entity31 , a @entity0 science - team member at the @entity32 , @entity33			0
' these materials tell us about secondary fluids that were transported through the region after the host rock formed			0
' veins such as these form where fluids move through cracked rock and leave minerals in the fractures , often affecting the chemistry of the rock surrounding the fractures			2
this view from the @entity49 on the arm of @entity0 is a close - up of a two - tone mineral vein at a site called ' @entity9 ' on lower @entity11			1
it was taken during night , illuminated by @entity55 @entity31 said , ' at least two secondary fluids have left evidence here			0
' we want to understand the chemistry of the different fluids that were here and the sequence of events			0
how have later fluids affected the host rock ? ' some of the sequence is known : @entity69 that formed lake - bed mudstones must have dried and hardened before the fractures formed			0
the dark material that lines the fracture walls reflects an earlier episode of fluid flow than the white , calcium - sulphate - rich veins do - although both flows occurred after the cracks formed			2
in total , what is now the planet 's arid northern plains would have contained at least 12.4 million cubic miles ( 20 million cubic km ) of water thanks to missions like @entity88 's @entity0 , we know @entity2 once had water - but until now we did n't know how much			2
scientists have provided the best estimates yet , claiming it once had more water than the @entity94 - and the planet kept these oceans for more than 1.5 billion years			0
the findings suggest there was ample time and water for life on @entity2 to thrive , but over the last 3.7 billion years the red planet has lost 87 per cent of its water - leaving it barren and dry			1
the study by scientists at @entity88 's @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity108 , is the first to determine just how much water @entity2 had in its past			2
during its wet @entity112 period - 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago - it is estimated that it had enough water to cover the entire surface in a liquid layer 450 feet ( 137 metres ) deep			0
however , it 's likely that most of the water formed an ocean that occupied the northern hemisphere of @entity2 , which would have been as deep as one mile ( 1.6km ) in places - comparable to the @entity123 on @entity124			2
the research estimates that , in total , what is now the planet 's arid northern plains would have contained at least 12.4 million cubic miles ( 20 million cubic kilometres ) of water			0
curiosity has been studying rocky areas since landing on the @entity2 surface in 2012			0
@entity9 is about 39 feet ( 12 meters ) higher than the bottom edge of the ' @entity137 ' outcrop of the bedrock forming the basal layer of @entity11 , at the center of @entity2 ' @entity141			1
' we investigated @entity143 the way a field geologist would , looking over the whole outcrop first to choose the best samples to collect , and it paid off , ' said @entity149 of @entity88 's @entity150			0
analysis is still in its early stages , but the three drilled samples from @entity137 have clear differences in mineral ingredients			0
it seems that the two - toned minerals were created from two distinctive wet periods on the planet			1
@entity0 is now exploring different layers of @entity11 in the hope of finding more clues to the red planet 's history .			1

mineral veins were found at a site called ' @entity9 ' on @entity11
they formed in @entity2 ' watery past above the now eroded , softer bedrock
two - toned minerals were created from two wet periods on the red planet
