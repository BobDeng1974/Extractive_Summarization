the final straw for me was when people at work started calling me ' @entity4 ' - i had to do something about my weight			1
i 'm sure it was meant affectionately , but i was mortified as i 'd never considered myself as ' big '			0
but the truth was last year , i tipped the scales at 16 stone - at least three stone overweight for my height ( i 'm 5 ft 11in )			1
i 'd tried and failed to shift the pounds that had crept on in the last three years			1
i 'd start a new diet with loads of enthusiasm , only to abandon my best - laid plans when the novelty wore off - usually once i 'd learned all there was to learn about the plan and any weight loss started to slow			1
which is why i came up with the idea of trying out ten different diets in 50 days			2
would it be possible to lose weight by changing diets regularly - without losing interest ? i 've always had a short attention span and this seemed an interesting challenge			1
fifty days seemed like a nice round number , and would mean i had to stick to each diet for only five days			2
my first step was a full health screening with my gp			0
i explained my plans and that i wanted to see the before and after health results - to my surprise she agreed and said she 'd be interested to see what happened , not just for my weight but for my overall health			2
my starting blood pressure was 136/81 and my overall cholesterol reading was 4 - both within the healthy ranges , but with definite room for improvement			2
the gp did warn me that if i did lose weight , i might not be able to keep it off because people who lose weight rapidly - typical of more extreme diets - tend to put it straight back on			1
nonetheless , i wanted to see if it was possible - and whether it would get round the tedium of dieting			2
@entity18 wondered if it be possible to lose weight by changing diet regularly - without losing interest i picked diets i had n't previously tried			1
the ten diets in order were : the 5:2 diet ; the @entity77 diet , where two out of three meals are replaced by @entity77 cereal or snack bars ; following @entity82 guidance for a healthy diet ; a juice fast ; the high - fat , low - carb @entity86 diet ; a raw food diet ; the baby food diet ( replacing two out of three meals a day with tiny jars of baby food , in order to cut calories ) ; calorie counting using a mobile phone app ; the grapefruit diet , which involves having either grapefruit or grapefruit juice before or after each meal , supposedly to boost fat - burning ; and the cabbage soup diet			1
i started with the 5:2			2
the idea is to restrict calories drastically for two days and eat normally for the rest of the week - three days in my case			2
on both fasting days , i ate tomato soup for lunch , one slice of toast ( with crusts cut off to shave off some calories ) with a small helping of beans for dinner and an apple			2
i was worried i 'd overdo it on the non-fasting days , as you can eat whatever you like			0
but , surprisingly , i found myself craving things like nuts and fruits rather than bacon sandwiches			0
i lost 5 lb in the five days - though i realised afterwards i 'd been following the female version of the diet and eating 500 calories on fast days , rather than the 600 recommended for men			1
i could have had those crusts after all ... i also lost 5 lb on diet two - the @entity77 diet , but it was much more boring			1
i could n't wait to move on to the next diet and there 's no way i could have stuck to it for more than five days			2
but at least swapping meals for low - calorie cereal was easy			2
the juice diet - diet four - by comparison , was a nightmare to follow			1
all the juices had to be made fresh and took ages to prepare			0
there would have been no way i could have lugged the required 3kg of fruit and veg into the office every day - fortunately my very understanding boss let me work from home that week			2
some looked like swamp water and my five - year - old daughter @entity153 asked me to stop helping her with her homework because my ' voice was smelly '			2
i bailed out a day early			0
nothing was as bad as diet six - raw food i did lose 4 lb on it , but i lost the same amount following the guidance for a balanced diet on the @entity82 website ( diet three ) , and it was much more enjoyable , with plenty of wholegrains , lots of vegetables and fruit , some meat and fish and not too much fat or sugar			1
nothing was technically off limits , and there was no calorie counting			0
i was surprised that this worked as it did n't feel like a diet			2
counting calories using a tracker app on my phone ( diet eight ) , the grapefruit diet ( diet nine ) and the baby food diet ( diet seven ) only shifted 1lb each			0
i hated the constant reminder that i was on a diet from logging everything i ate on my phone , the baby food was bland mush and i now like grapefruit a lot less than before			0
i lost a little more - 1½ lb - on the @entity196 ( diet five ) of eggs , meat , butter and cheese			1
with no starchy foods or sugar , your body is supposed to use body fat for fuel			0
the downside was that i was almost instantly bored and miserable			0
but nothing was as bad as diet six - the raw food diet			1
i was feeling really run down by this point and my throat was sore			0
but i persevered with the incredibly strict plan of food in its uncooked , unprocessed state - so raw fruit and veg , nuts and seeds , and not much else			0
fans claim food in this unadulterated state allows the body to function at its best , helping shed excess weight			0
of course , it helps that this sort of food tends to have few calories			0
by day three of the raw food plan , my throat was worse and i could n't taste anything ( no bad thing when nothing can be cooked )			0
i woke in the middle of the night struggling to breathe , resulting in a 5 am trip to @entity234			0
i was diagnosed with an infection , requiring antibiotics and rest			0
it seems foolish now , but i did n't mention my diet challenge			0
i spent the next two days in bed eating almost nothing - i lost 3 lb , although how much of this was down to illness rather than the diet is hard to say			1
i left the diet i 'd been dreading most till last - the @entity244			1
every meal was low calorie cabbage soup			1
no amount of herbs and spices could mask the fact it was yet another bowl of soup made from cabbage , onions and water			1
and as many other cabbage soup dieters have reported , it gives you bad breath and terrible wind			1
i felt sorry for my poor wife , who had already put up with 45 days of my see - sawing moods			0
but for the first time in years , i 'd managed to stick to my plan to diet for more than a couple of weeks - and in total i lost 30½ lb. i could see my feet for the first time in years and my waist had gone from 38 - 40 inches to 34 - 36 inches			1
i felt happy and healthy - although my doctor had news for me on that front			0
for while my blood pressure was a tiny bit lower , at 130/80 , my cholesterol had gone up to 4.3 , and this increase was down to a rise in so - called ' bad ' ldl cholesterol			0
my gp explained that extreme diets essentially shock the body ; and in its confused state subtle changes can happen - not all helpful - which might explain why my @entity286 was slightly up			1
she said people 's exact reactions will vary , and added that if i keep the weight off , she would expect an improvement in my readings			0
there were other lessons too			0
around the four - week mark , i stopped weighing myself every day - something i always used to do when i was on a diet , and then not at all when i fell off the wagon			1
weighing myself daily meant i would often see no change or even a slight increase and it was demotivating			0
this time , perhaps because of the variety of the diets , i could stick it out long enough to see other changes that are more important than the number on the scale - my double chin was receding , my skin was better , i was finding my weekly run easier			1
there was only one way of eating out of the ten that i could stick to long - term - and that 's the diet set out by the @entity82			1
and now i know it can really work just as well as a plan with stricter , faddier rules			0
it 's nearly two months since i finished my ten - diet whirl , and unlike any other time i 've dieted , i still feel determined to stick to healthy eating			1
while i would n't recommend my methods to anyone , this was the first january in ages where i have n't been tempted by the latest @entity326 diet - in fact , i truly believe i will never do another diet again , thank goodness ! @entity18 's book @entity329 - 10 diets to lose 25 lb in 50 days is available to download on @entity332 at the special offer price of 99p .			1
