in this picture a student pours @entity14 over his head lavish : the @entity9 footage shows a group of well - dressed young men from @entity12 decadently drenching themselves in £ 25 bottles of @entity14 joke : bottles of @entity14 are poured over the heads of these students on @entity33 in @entity34 in a scene mimicking @entity36 for the majority of hard - pressed students , £ 700 would cover at least two month 's rent			1
the university - where the @entity41 and @entity42 met as students - was last month slammed for admitting a just tiny percentage of young people from impoverished backgrounds			1
set to a soundtrack which features music from @entity51 rapper @entity50 , who often boasts about his wealth , the video begins with a male student entering his local @entity55 supermarket and walking past the milk aisle - a nod to the recent ' milking ' craze at @entity59 , in which undergrads covered themselves in pints of the white stuff			0
the curly - haired @entity34 student then stops beside bottles of vintage port - which costs around £ 7 - but shakes his head in an apparent boast that he can afford better			2
he is seen picking up the pricey bottle of @entity14 before promptly emptying it over himself outside the shop in front of crowds of people			2
the remainder of the three minute 39 second video - which was taken down from @entity9 early this evening - features a number of similarly daft clips of the young men wasting the pricey fizz			1
getting ready : a group of students are pictured gathering with their bottles of champagne on @entity85 soaking : the group then take their robes off and douse themselves in the champagne jump : the group them leap off the pier with the bottles in their hands locations used include the @entity95 on the town 's famous @entity96 , outside the university library , on the steps of the student union , outside @entity101 , in the famous @entity103 's @entity102 , on the pier in their famous tomato - coloured gowns which they then remove and jump , and in the busy @entity109			2
one young man is even filmed pouring a £ 80 magnum of champagne over his naked body in a bubble bath			0
seven of the lads recreate the renowned scene from film @entity36 on @entity118 - running along the shore pouring champers over their heads to the film 's @entity123 - winning original soundtrack composed by @entity125			0
expensive : in total , 25 bottles of bubbly can be counted , including a massive magnum - which would cost in excess of £ 700 at the tills silly : this student douses himself in champagne in the famous @entity103 's @entity102 landmark : this student stands on the famous @entity95 on the @entity96 at @entity34 it 's not known whether the magnum was a full new bottle at the start of the prank , but the standard - sized bottles are clearly genuine			1
@entity12 - which has @entity3 's toughest entry requirements - was criticised earlier this year after admitting just 14 students from the 20 most deprived areas in @entity3 in 2011.many of its students come from @entity147 's top public schools			2
but in sharp retort last month , the university said that it expected ' to face a considerable and continuing challenge to widen access , because so few young people from @entity3 's most deprived areas are achieving basic university entry grades '			0
mocking : the video mocks the recent ' milking ' craze			0
