by @entity0 last updated at 10:04 pm on 24th december 2011 another woman has come forward claiming she was abused by a celebrated @entity3 sports columnist when she was a child			2

she told the @entity22 - the paper which first published the allegations - their accounts had empowered her to give her own			2
' when i read it , i started to cry , ' the mother - of - two from @entity26 said			2
' i just felt overwhelmed			0
the fact that i was n't the only one made me feel stronger			0
' the latest alleged victim said @entity4 , who was a family friend , assaulted her twice during his visits to her family 's home			1
stunned , she asked him not to touch her and the abuse ended after she told a lifeguard what had happened			0
retired : @entity4 had worked at the @entity5 in @entity3 since 1965 but immediately retired when the article accusing him of abuse was published it comes just days after a sixth accuser , @entity40 , 50 , told the @entity5 that @entity4 molested her on two occasions at his @entity12 home			1
@entity4 retired abruptly last tuesday , shortly before @entity22 published a story online detailing allegations of abuse from three women and a man in the 1970s			1

on hearing of the first abuse accusations on december 20 , he retired from the @entity5 immediately , and his editor accepted			1
@entity4 , who is a grandfather , married wife @entity72 in 1960 - before the abuse allegedly took place			1

he has denied the allegations			0
' this has obviously been crushing to mr. @entity4 , ' his lawyer @entity79 told the @entity22			1
' frankly , i am now more concerned about mr. @entity4 and his ability to carry on			1
' in the original article posted by the @entity22 , it said three women and a man claim they were molested as children by @entity9 in the 1970s			0
one of them , @entity9 's niece , was quoted by the @entity22 as saying : ' people have kept his secret			0

' according to the @entity22 , the four adults said @entity4 groped and fondled them and touched their genitals when they were from ages seven to 12			2
a detective with the @entity105 , @entity12 prosecutor 's office said criminal charges could not be pursued because assaults that occurred before 1996 fall under the statute of limitations			1
' we would love to see justice in this case , ' detective @entity110 of the @entity111 wrote in an e-mail to one of the women last month			0
free : as the statute of limitations has expired , @entity4 , now 77 , can not be charged for any of the alleged child abuse crimes as they occurred too long ago ' so many people have been victimized by this man , but our hands are tied by the law , which does not let us prosecute			1

' ' everybody says he will do the right thing , get involved , put his own ass on the line before or after the fact , ' he wrote			0
' but the moment itself has a cruel way of suspending our fearless intentions			0
