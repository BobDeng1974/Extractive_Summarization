by @entity0 published : 05:25 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 08:51 est , 5 august 2013 bosses at a hospital trust with the highest mortality rate in @entity4 spend hundreds of pounds on two taxi trips across @entity6			2
@entity7 , the disgraced chief executive at @entity9 , and his board of directors took two minibuses costing the taxpayer £ 550 on a journey that could have cost as little as £ 63 each way on public transport			1
they were in the capital for a meeting with monitor which oversees the foundation status process			0
while there during the trip in april 2009 they stayed at the £ 200 - a - night @entity24 , @entity25			2
write caption here the cost of the taxi trip came from a return trip in a 16 - seater minibus costing £ 275 each way			1
had they taken the @entity35 tube from @entity36 to @entity37 and walked the short distance to the hotel , it would have cost them a total of just £ 63 each way			2
the journey was taken before mr @entity7 was forced to step down as chief executive in 2012 , after the trust was exposed as having the highest mortality rate in @entity4			1
the matter sparked a police investigation into the trust 's failings following the death of nine - day - old @entity52 , who died at @entity53 in 2008 after staff failed to spot and treat an infection			2
a @entity57 report published in june this year revealed that there had been a ‘ cover up ’ of neglect at @entity53 in @entity60 , @entity61			0
the trust faces at least 30 civil negligence claims			0
however , despite the fallout @entity7 will continue to claim his full £ 150,606 salary until october			1
among the disgraced chief ’s spending of £ 10,055 , which ran from january 2009 to february 2012 , was a £ 3,249 stay for 15 board members in the @entity71 in @entity25 , now owned by hotel chain @entity72 , in £ 200 - plus rooms			1
excess : bosses at @entity9 of @entity76 spent hundreds of pounds on a taxi rather than take the @entity78			0
above , @entity53 , where staff failed to spot @entity52 had picked up an infection a separate staff trip in 2010 to visit the headquarters of clinical software company @entity83 cost the trust £ 804 in airfare alone to transport ‘ key clinical staff ’ to its @entity88 base in @entity89			0
mr @entity7 also splashed out £ 334 on flowers for eight members of staff in june 2010 and a further £ 48 on flowers for one member of staff the following year			1
the trust has said strict guidelines are in place and mr @entity7 had spent the money legitimately			1
@entity99 , director of finance and information at the trust , said : “ the chief executive credit card is used for the legitimate business expenses of not only the chief executive , but other appropriate staff within the trust			1
' therefore , it is important to note that not all the expenses shown in the @entity110 request response related to the former chief executive			1
' this is no different than in many other organisations , and in some cases , can offer better value			0
' for example , the cost associated with the travel and accommodation of the whole trust board ( consisting of 15 individuals ) , to take part in a required meeting in @entity6 with the trust ’s regulator , monitor , as part of its foundation trust application in 2009			0
' any expenses incurred on the corporate credit card account must be in line with the rules governing its use , which ensure that only legitimate business expenses can be claimed for			0
' for each instance the card is used , a separate form is required with all receipts attached			0
these are independently verified by the trust ’s finance department as part of the payment process			0

bosses racked up the excessive bill while their hospitals were in *crisis*
they hired a 16 - seater minibus rather than take the tube across town
chief executive @entity7 also *lavished* public money on flowers for staff
the disgraced boss still draws his six - figure salary despite stepping down
