@entity1 's iconic red telephone boxes have been given a modern makeover - as mobile phone chargers			1
painted green and given a trendy logo , this is the @entity1 's first landmark to be transformed into a solar - powered device			1
while many phone boxes in @entity1 's capital fall into disrepair , the @entity8 is giving them a much - needed boost			1
green : the old telephone boxes are also being painted green to emphasise the greener economy placed outside exit three outside @entity15 in @entity16 , the @entity8 is the work of two geography graduates from @entity16 's @entity19 who started the project in 2013			1
with the help of funding from a variety of schemes , they 've created this new addition to @entity16 's streets			2
@entity27 , co-founder of @entity8 , said : ' @entity8 is turning @entity16 's disused telephone boxes into solar - powered charging points for mobile phones			1
the @entity8 was created by transforming a traditional @entity16 telephone box into a solar powered charger ' the idea for @entity8 came about through three reasons really			1
' the first is that phone boxes are n't used anymore			2
the second is modern phone battery life ca n't keep up the pace with our lives			0
and the third is there is nowhere really to charge your phones in the public realm			0
' so we did some research , we held some focus groups and brought these three things together and this is the end product			0
' red telephone boxes first began appearing on @entity16 's streets during the 1920s			1
since then , they 've become as much a part of @entity1 as @entity56 and fish and chips - particularly to the capital 's tourists			2
despite @entity62 - who make the phone boxes - discontinuing the traditional design during the 1980s , they 've still remained symbolic to this day			2
divisive : @entity66 , co-founder of @entity8 said some people love the green while others hate it according to @entity27 , there are around 67,000 phone boxes in the @entity1 and 8,000 in @entity16			1
so how have people been reacting to the drastic change in colour ? she says : ' i think the verdict is still out on the green			0
' as some smart phones take hours to charge rather than minutes , @entity27 says the @entity8 was n't built with a long stay in mind			2
instead , it 's intended for phone users desperate for a quick charge to make an important call			2
' the whole of this in all our research was based on people who need that bit of extra juice to make an emergency phone call , ' she says			0
@entity95 : there are numerous charge points in each box and they need just three hours of sunlight per day ' or people who are in this busy area - which is a big through - way - who just want to take the opportunity to top up			0
' and despite the box 's reliance on solar power , @entity16 's wet weather is n't set to put a dampener on any desperately - needed charging			1
according to @entity27 , the @entity8 only needs three hours of sunlight a day to keep its inbuilt battery pumping out power			0
' we need three hours of sunlight a day to operate all year round , ' she says			0
idea : ms @entity27 said the idea was initiated as modern phone battery life ' ca n't keep up the pace with our lives ' ' and the reason that we only need so little sunlight is cause we 've got an integrated battery			0
so , through the summer months or on the sunnier days that battery is storing all excess energy to be used throughout the year			0
' what does @entity16 's phone - using public make of the new addition to their streets ? engineer , @entity133 , has plugged in , but does he think it 's a winner ? ' definitely , because i work as an engineer i 'm always looking for charging points , so this is really a fantastic idea , ' he says			1
' a lot of these phone boxes , they 're not used anyway			0
everyone 's got a mobile so it 's a really good idea			0
' @entity8 hopes to launch a further six boxes around @entity16 in early 2015 .			1

telephone box is first ever be changed into a solar - powered phone charger
@entity8 is located at exit three outside @entity15
idea was developed by two graduates from @entity16 's @entity19
@entity8 hopes to launch a further six boxes around @entity16 in early 2015
