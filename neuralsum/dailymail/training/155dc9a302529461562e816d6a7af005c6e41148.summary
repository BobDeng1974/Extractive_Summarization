nicknamed variously @entity24 and the @entity25 - after the day of the week when many of his victims were found in forests - he eluded police for two decades as investigators catastrophically ignored evidence that the mystery killer could be one of their own officers who used his uniform to gain trust			1

there was an investigation and he was not punished , the chiefs considered he had taken fair action			0
' @entity37 psychiatrist @entity273 said : ' the fact that only drunk women attracted him could be the result of his childhood problems and associations - his mother used to drink alcohol and often abused him			1
' maybe in his childhood other drunk women abused him too , and all this affected his behaviour later in his adult life and led to such horrible consequences			1
