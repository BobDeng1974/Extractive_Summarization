by @entity0 attorney general @entity1 said the government had listened to the concerns of media groups ministers last night abandoned plans that could have created a ‘ black hole ’ in history by forcing newspapers to delete details of criminal convictions from their online archives			1
in a victory for freedom of expression , attorney general @entity1 said the government had listened to the concerns of media groups and the @entity19 that the move could have a ‘ chilling effect ’			1
the controversy stemmed from new rules which are designed to stop jurors from hunting for facts about a case outside the courtroom			1
in future , it will become a specific offence for a member of a jury to conduct online research , punishable with a prison term			1
but mr @entity1 was also seeking a new power to issue a so - called ‘ take - down ’ order to @entity38 newspapers			1
once a person was charged with a criminal offence , officials would have been able to identity articles relating to any previous convictions they have – and demand their removal from newspaper websites			2
editors who ignored a request would have faced imprisonment or an unlimited fine for contempt of court			0
in theory , the information could be returned to the archive once the trial is complete , but it was feared some papers would not have the resources , permanently wiping facts from the record			0
the laws would have applied to @entity38 newspapers , but not the likes of the @entity63 , which receives millions of hits in @entity38			0
@entity65 would not have been covered , either			0
in a statement yesterday , mr @entity1 said the proposal was being removed from legislation currently passing through @entity69			2
it followed a meeting with the @entity19 , @entity72 and @entity73 , who have argued the plans would have a “ chilling effect ” on press freedom			0
‘ the government has considered these concerns very carefully ’ attorney general @entity1 announcing the changes , mr @entity1 said in a written ministerial statement : “ the proposal was intended to provide the media with a measure of protection and reassurance whilst at the same time enabling the integrity of proceedings to be safeguarded			1
‘ although intended as a measure designed to assist and protect the media , the clause has been criticised on the grounds that it gives too much power to the attorney general			0
‘ these representations were made to me , in particular , by the @entity19 who in addition do not accept that this clause addresses a pressing problem and have suggested that the current powers available are sufficient to protect proceedings			0
‘ the government has considered these concerns very carefully			2
’ @entity103 , executive director of the @entity19 said : ‘ when we met the attorney we said it would be wrong in principle for a member of the government to have power to order media organisations to take down material			1
‘ we also told him that it would cause huge practical problems if defence lawyers sought blanket orders to taken down material which could be seen by jurors			0
‘ we are very pleased that the attorney has listened to our concerns			2
