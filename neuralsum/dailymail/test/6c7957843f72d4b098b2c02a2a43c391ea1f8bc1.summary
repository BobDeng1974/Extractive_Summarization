by the time @entity0 ties the knot next saturday he will hopefully have forgotten the utter frustration at becoming @entity5 's @entity4			1
the 27 - year - old @entity6 has lost his last seven matches to the @entity8 , this one the @entity9 final 7 - 6 4 - 6 6 - 0 on a brutally punishing afternoon , suffering the undeserving ignominy of conceding another love set against his old rival			1
he pushed him hard and had enough early chances to have won it in straight sets			0
in fact @entity0 pushed @entity5 so hard that , at the end of the second set , the furious @entity8 wrenched his towel off a startled ballkid and screamed at his box on his way to the chair , gaining a warning as his mask of statesmanship slipped			2
@entity5 raises his arms aloft after claiming victory over @entity0 7 - 6 4 - 6 6 - 0 in the @entity9 @entity5 poses with the @entity32 trophy on the beach at @entity34 after his @entity9 win the @entity8 gives the thumbs up as he shows off the glass trophy on the beach in @entity39 the @entity41 world no 1 jumps for joy as he celebrates his success over @entity0 in the final @entity5 kisses his fifth @entity9 winner 's trophy after an emphatic finish to the match on sunday a deflated @entity0 holds his runners - up trophy alongside @entity5 after the pair battle the heat of @entity53 a fired - up @entity5 battled to a three - set victory over @entity0 for his fifth @entity9 winner 's trophy @entity5 snatches his towel from a ball boy at the end of the second set , claimed by @entity0 the @entity41 yells after @entity0 broke his serve to claim the second set and take the match to a decider @entity0 has had a good enough week to walk down the aisle with @entity64 having got back to world no 3 , but it is now ten out of eleven defeats against the world no 1			1
how to seize the moment against this phenomenal competitor is a hugely pressing issue for him and everyone else			0
as for @entity5 , he will now be holding that distinction for the 141st week of his career on monday , putting him on sixth equal in the all - time list with @entity76			2
in some ways this was a truncated version of their @entity80 final			0
a forlorn @entity0 reflected afterwards : ' game wise , i feel like in the couple of the matches we played this year i 've been able to hang with him , but just not quite for long enough unfortunately			0
@entity0 celebrates his first break of @entity5 's serve in the opening set at @entity89 @entity91 1 @entity5 powers a forehand back at the @entity93 during their clash in @entity34 , @entity53 @entity0 plays a slice backhand during a tight first set that included four breaks of serve before the tie - break @entity0 takes a moment in the shade as the @entity39 sun beams down on the finalists @entity5 ( left ) and @entity0 launch into a forehand and backhand respectively as they battle it out in @entity39 ' i need to try to work out why that is			1
i played well for two sets and was struggling physically in the third			0
i do n't feel like i can do loads more than what i 'm doing to get myself in the best condition possible , i do push myself very hard			0
' the first set was notable for @entity0 's early aggression that brought him a break in the third game and should have seen him open up a 3 - 1 lead			1
but it transpired that it was desperately difficult playing into the fierce lunchtime sun. nobody actually held at the city end of the court until the eleventh game when the @entity8 managed it			0
@entity0 forced the tiebreak but , beginning on the more difficult side , could not recover from 0 - 4 down as he hit several forehands long			2
djokovic dives desperately at the net as the first set goes the distance in the blazing heat @entity0 shows his frustration as his two breaks in the first set are immediately countered by the @entity41 both stars struggled serving into the sun with all four breaks in the first set coming from the same end @entity5 had been starting to blow hard – rather like he did in @entity140 – and just like in @entity142 it all proved to be irrelevant as he took it 7 - 3			1
gauging how the 27 year - old @entity8 is feeling is an extremely inexact science , and you could only speculate as a brutally punishing second set unfolded in more level fashion than the break - filled opener			0
@entity0 became more and more agitated as he failed to gain the breakthrough but held on until 5 - 4 when @entity5 dissolved into a ball of @entity152 anger			1
@entity0 broke him to love and the @entity8 angrily snatched his towel off the ballboy , apologising later : ' i 'm sorry , because i did n't pay attention to the ball boy and i just screamed at my box , ' he said			0
the sun - soaked scene in @entity39 as a pair of @entity164 helicopters fly over the @entity165 @entity0 's fiancee @entity64 ( left ) and @entity5 's wife @entity166 take shade under big hats in @entity53 @entity0 's coach @entity170 cheers on the @entity172 no 1 in front of his soon - to - be wife @entity64 @entity0 remonstrates with himself as he shows some emotion in front of his second home crowd @entity0 jumps for joy as he claims the second set but he is n't able to keep the pep in his step in the third @entity53 - based @entity140 golf legend @entity182 takes in the @entity9 final with his wife @entity184 @entity5 wipes away the sweat shows his frustration as he falters in the second set in @entity34 there was also a volley of abuse , @entity0 style , towards @entity192 and his support team up in the box , but it only seemed to galvanise @entity5			1
@entity0 had to hold at the start of the decider to set him on his way to what would have been a massive victory in the context of his season , the first time he had won a masters level event since his @entity205 triumph of 2013			2
the first three games of the decider were long and hard before – helped by some wonky @entity0 overheads – @entity5 just cracked his opponent 's body and spirit .			2

@entity5 won the first set tie - break 7 - 3 after each player broke serve twice
