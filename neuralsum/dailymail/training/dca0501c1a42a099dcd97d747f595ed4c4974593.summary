by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity4 ’s @entity3 volcano has been hit by the strongest earthquake since tremors began over a week ago , raising fears that another ash cloud disaster may become reality			1
the earthquake reached a magnitude of 5.7 , potentially leading @entity4 to yet again bring the warning code to red level			1
airlines around the world remain on high alert as the magnitude of the quakes increase , but local geologists say they have yet to see signs of an eruption			2
‘ there was one event during the night , it was a magnitude 5.7 earthquake , the largest in this series , ’ @entity35 , a geologist at the @entity36 said			1
‘ activity is still deep and we see no signs of anything close to the surface			0
’ on sunday , @entity4 lowered its warning code for possible volcanic disruption to the aviation industry to orange from red , the highest level on the country 's five - point alert system , after concluding that seismic activity had not led to a volcanic eruption under the glacier			1
red alert indicates an eruption is imminent or underway with a significant emission of ash likely			1
trembling times : although the earthquake has not caused an eruption , there are fears of a repeat scenario of the @entity32 ash cloud in 2010 bad boom : the 2010 eruption of a volcano under the @entity32 glacier , pictured , severely disrupted @entity34 air travel for several weeks after ash spewed into the atmosphere @entity77 scientists believe the earthquakes are a result of magma flowing out from under the crater of the volcano , causing a change in pressure			1
‘ we still ca n't say whether it will cease , continue like this for a while or erupt			0
it 's impossible to say , ’ @entity35 said			0
there have been thousands of smaller quakes over the past week at @entity3 , and areas around the volcano , in the centre of the @entity93 island nation , have been evacuated			2
however , before an eruption air travel will not be affected , a spokesman for the @entity98 @entity97 said last week			2
' the ( @entity98 ) @entity77 will be monitoring what 's occurring			0
they will be sending out forecasts about the atmosphere and any ash in the air , ' he said			0
' if the eruption does occur we will issue what 's called a notice to airmen informing them of the conditions			0
it 's then up to the airlines with their safety teams and experts whether to fly			0
