amateur radio - also called ham radio - operators were dealt a treat this weekend , when @entity3 aboard the @entity4 communicated with @entity5			1
and one first - time enthusiast received a welcome surprise when , using a usb dongle and other equipment , he was able to receive the transmissions from the cosmonauts orbiting @entity12			1
by analysing the bits of data they sent , he was able to piece together images and sounds from the space station that commemorated moments in @entity3 and the @entity20 ’s space history			1
scroll down for a video of the sounds and to see how the image decoding is done a ham radio operator from @entity25 has received images from the iss. on @entity27 he revealed his low - cost method to talk to cosmonauts			1
he used a usb dongle known as an @entity34 - @entity33 to receive sounds			1
when decoded these were revealed to be images of @entity3 space history ( postcard of @entity40 shown ) the amazing images were posted to @entity27 by 22 - year - old student @entity42 , from @entity25			1
' these images are not transmitted regularly			2
i was really lucky to receive them , because it was my first experience with this kind of equipment , ' he told @entity50			0
' i blindly tuned in on that frequency during @entity4 flyby and happened to receive the signal			2
' astronauts and cosmonauts on the station regularly communicate with people back on @entity12 using ham radio			1
indeed , anyone with a radio licence and the right equipment can transmit to the crew and talk to them			2
a licence is not required to listen in , however			0
construction of the @entity4 began on 20 november 1998			2
it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three			0
the station orbits at a height of about 255 miles ( 410km )			0
it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds ( 450,000kg ) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five - bedroom house			0
it completes an orbit of @entity12 every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles ( 27,600km ) per hour			0
it has now been in space for more than 5,900 days , during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of @entity12 , and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years			0
over the weekend , the @entity3 decided to use a picture transmission method known as slow - scan television ( @entity83 ) to relay images to @entity12			1
in this instance the images included several of @entity40 , who became the first human in space on 12 april 1961 - and was born more than 80 years ago on 9 march 1934			2
@entity40 is seen in his spacesuit preparing for launch , while the rocket that took him to space - an evolution of which is still in operation today - was also transmitted with the images			2
' i think it 's a great way to commemorate the first person that went to space , ' mr @entity42 added			0
' having an international crew on the station all the time is something to really think about and appreciate			0
' it shows that our civilisation can cooperate to achieve great things , and i 'm sure that is something that will grow			0
' and it 's great that they still remember about their roots			0
' by listening to the transmitted sound broadcast on voice frequencies , receivers were able to decode the incoming messages and see the pictures the cosmonauts on the @entity4 decided to send			2
‘ images are transmitted using the @entity83 ( @entity83 ) protocol , ’ mr @entity42 explained on imgur , where he posted the images			0
‘ before the picture transmission started , i could hear an astronaut voice - " this is @entity125 " - which is @entity126 in the @entity128 phonetic alplabet			0
@entity126 is the @entity3 callsign from the station , while the @entity131 used the callsign @entity4 when they communicate with ham operators			1
to receive the images and sounds , mr @entity42 said he used an @entity136 dongle ( shown ) , an antenna , the @entity139 programme to receive the data and @entity142 software to decode it here is one of the images received by mr @entity42			1
the caption reads : ' 80 years since the birth of the first cosmonaut of the planet @entity149 ' to receive the images and sounds , mr @entity42 said he used an @entity34 - @entity33 dongle , an antenna , the @entity139 programme to receive the data and @entity142 software to decode it			1
the software is available free online , while such a dongle costs around £ 10 ( $ 15 )			0
according to the website @entity158 , the transmissions took place on saturday 31 january and sunday 1 february			0
in total 12 images were sent by the @entity3 @entity4 crew			1
to make contact , line - of - sight with the station is required , so ham radio operators tune in when the @entity4 is flying over their location			1
@entity4 crew members often make unscheduled calls back to @entity12 with ham radios when they have a spare moment			1
and by picking up a few bits of equipment you , too , could listen and talk with the astronauts and cosmonauts on the station			0
astronauts and cosmonauts on the @entity4 ( pictured ) regularly communicate with amateur radio - also known as ham radio - operators back on @entity12 @entity181 astronaut @entity180 , @entity182 flight engineer , is pictured using a ham radio system in the @entity184 of the @entity4 on 5 september 2010			1

a ham radio operator from @entity25 has received images from the @entity4
on @entity27 he revealed his low - cost method to talk to cosmonauts
he used a usb dongle known as an @entity34 - @entity33 to receive sounds
when decoded these were revealed to be images of @entity3 space history
amateur radio enthusiasts can regularly talk to @entity4 crew members
