by @entity0 for @entity1 researchers have called for volunteers to help count penguins in the @entity5 from the comfort of their own home using thousands of photographs to identify adults , chicks and eggs			1
the call has been placed by the @entity13 ( @entity14 ) , based in @entity15 , to assist researchers at @entity17 in the @entity18 to understand behaviour patterns , breeding and the effect predators have on penguins			1
volunteer counters will be studying images captured by 40 cameras spread across three regions of @entity27 - from @entity29 's station to @entity30			2
researchers ultimately hope this process will help develop an algorithm to teach computers how to automatically count penguins , the @entity32 reports			1
@entity51 from @entity13 hopes the research will also explain the impact of fisheries on a mass scale			2
' what it 's about is trying to use the interest of a large number of people out there through online communications to contribute to scientific research , ' dr @entity51 said			0
images have been captured by researchers using 40 cameras spread across three regions of @entity27 - from @entity29 's station to @entity70 bay he said researchers are looking for non-scientists who are interested in science and penguins to contribute to the study			2
' most people are interested in @entity27			0
most people are interested in penguins , and it 's fun			0
' volunteer @entity80 told the @entity32 she came across the study on @entity82			0
she said although she never studied science she has always been interested			0
' there are adorable chicks in some of the photos and you can never get too tired of looking at penguins , ' she said			0
if the study proves successful researchers hope to count other seabirds in the @entity5 and @entity92			1
the 200,000 photographs , many taken by the @entity13 , will hopefully help explain how human activity and environmental changes impact penguins behaviour patterns , breeding and the effect predators will also be looked at so identify early warning signs that could lead to a problem the study is after non-scientists who are interested in science and penguins to count penguins in the @entity5 from the comfort of their home researchers hope to eventually develop an algorithm to teach computers how to automatically count penguins in an image rather than using humans if the study proves successful researchers hope to count other seabirds in the @entity5 and @entity92			1

@entity18 researchers have scanned in *hundreds* of thousands of photographs of penguins taken in the @entity5
the @entity13 has placed a call out for volunteer counters to study images to help identify adults , chicks and eggs
researchers hope to eventually teach computers how to automatically count penguins in an image
eventually other sea - birds in the @entity5 and @entity92 will be photographed and counted
