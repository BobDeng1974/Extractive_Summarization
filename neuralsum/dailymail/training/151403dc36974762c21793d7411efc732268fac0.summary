it is photo in which @entity3 artist @entity2 wanted to capture a desolate but ‘ accurate image of a modern river ’			1
he even turned to computer trickery to remove any intrusive features – dog walkers , cyclists , a factory building – until it was bleak enough to satisfy him			2
and while it is hard to argue that he has achieved his aim - it is even harder to see why someone would pay a substantial sum of money to own the piece			0
but the digitally altered - and some might say visually uninteresting - ' @entity21 ' has become the most expensive photograph ever sold at auction			1
@entity2 's image , title @entity21 , was digitally altered to achieve the level of bleakness desired by the artist @entity2 's photo sold for $ 4.3m at auction and the 1999 photograph has sold for $ 4.3million ( £ 2.7m ) at @entity32 in @entity33			1
it is not known who bought the glass - mounted 80in by 140in print			0
the auction house described it as ‘ a dramatic and profound reflection on human existence and our relationship to nature on the cusp of the 21st century ’			0
the previous record for any photography sold at auction was @entity48 's 1981 print ‘ untitled ’ , which fetched $ 3.8million at @entity32 in may			2
@entity2 's panoramic image of the @entity21 is one of an edition of six photographs			1
four are in major museums , including the @entity54 in @entity33 and the @entity55 in @entity56 .			0

@entity2 's ' @entity21 ' was digitally altered to make it more desolate
