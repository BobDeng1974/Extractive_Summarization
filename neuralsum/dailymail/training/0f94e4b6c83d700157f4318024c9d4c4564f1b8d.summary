click here to read @entity2 's match report from @entity3			1
for half an hour here on tuesday night we saw the embodiment of the vision @entity8 talked about when he arrived at @entity3 two - and - a - half seasons ago			1
players swarming like red ants towards the @entity11			0
a good team - perhaps the very best in the country - pinned back in their own half			2
that @entity17 did n't win - they did n't do tangibly more than remind @entity18 they remain a team of which they should be very wary - was due to the thickness of a post and the fact that visiting goalkeeper @entity25 is 6ft 7ins tall			1
it was @entity27 who struck the post and substitute @entity29 who brought a terrific full - length save from the @entity31 with a rasping drive from the edge of the penalty area			0
@entity35 celebrates after scoring for @entity17 in the @entity37 semi-final against @entity18 @entity8 has promised all season his side would regain their tempo and they did on tuesday @entity35 showcased his blistering pace as he cut @entity18 's defensive shape to pieces before sliding home almost the entire @entity47 rushed to congratulate their 20 - year - old attacker at @entity3 this was the kind of football that @entity8 has been waiting for this season			1
the dextrous , high - tempo full - court press that he drills into his players ' brains on a daily basis at their @entity58 training base			2
through the difficult times of the first half of the season , @entity8 promised this style of play - this relentless rhythm - would return and on tuesday night it was spectacularly evident during a second half that they dominated			1
@entity17 had to come from behind but the statistics show that they should really have won			2
they had 20 shots as opposed to @entity18 's two , for example , while the only time @entity17 's @entity70 was really examined properly was when @entity71 beat him with a penalty in the first half			1
this was a night that was good for @entity17 and indeed good for @entity77 football			2
@entity18 need teams other than @entity79 that can genuinely challenge them			0
@entity25 was out quickly to thwart @entity35 as @entity17 looked to get back in the game but for @entity25 , @entity17 would have won the game against @entity18 at @entity3 on tuesday evening had @entity8 ' team being facing anyone other than @entity18 - dogged , cussed , resilient @entity18 - and @entity25 then they surely would have won and it will be intriguing now to see if @entity17 can go to @entity85 next week and dismantle a @entity18 home record that is rather formidable			1
@entity88 's team have played 15 games at @entity90 this season			1
they have won 14 and drawn one			0
that 's the nature of @entity17 's task			1
after the final whistle on tuesday night , @entity88 was perhaps as magnanimous as he gets			1
' @entity17 did n't deserve to lose , ' he said			0
@entity71 comfortably stroked home a penalty in the 18th minute to give @entity18 the lead @entity100 ( right ) had been caught out of position in the build - up to the penalty incident before tripping @entity71 deep down he will know the truth , though , and it says something for his own team 's spirit that they came away with anything at all from this game			1
for a spell they were in charge			0
there was little between the teams for the opening quarter of an hour and , when @entity71 scored his penalty , it was easy to wonder if @entity18 would just ease away as they did when they won here 2 - 1 in the @entity122 last november			1
ultimately , though , @entity18 needed something more than their usual stylish purpose as the game turned around on the back of improved @entity17 football			1
hazard coolly wheels away after sending @entity17 goalkeeper @entity70 the wrong way from the spot they needed some resolution , some endeavour and some mental stubbornness			0
on nights like this , when the red tide has turned , you simply need a refusal to lose			0
it helps if you have a terrific goalkeeper as well and @entity25 perhaps showed again just why he rivals @entity143 's @entity142 as the best in @entity77 and perhaps @entity145			0
the 22 - year - old possesses a remarkable confidence and if this was an audition for the no 1 position ahead of @entity151 for the rest of the season then it is perhaps one he passed			2
@entity27 epitomised how @entity17 have improved from earlier in the season @entity17 supporters hold a banner in support of their captain aloft during the semi-final first leg there is an assurance about the @entity18 goalkeeper 's work that makes him so difficult to criticise			1
he does the routine things effortlessly and the difficult things regularly			0
in the first half he was only really tested by one @entity27 shot from distance but when @entity17 moved through the gears in the second half they found him all but unpassable			2
the goal that did beat him was superb and scored by a wonderful talent			0
@entity8 will hope that his centre forward @entity176 returns to fitness soon so that @entity35 can be used where he is most dangerous , running from deep to score like this			0
@entity35 bought himself a yard off @entity181 and placed across @entity25 to send @entity3 wild @entity183 rose highest against central defender @entity181 but was n't able to force home his header after that it seemed likely that @entity17 would break through again			1
@entity18 rode their luck at times and the save that @entity25 produced from @entity29 with a few minutes remaining really was deserving of earning an away draw all on its own			0
ultimately , it was wonderful to see these teams locked in genuine battle once again			0
the game @entity18 won here to deny @entity17 the title last april was a one - off for its sheer peculiarity while the match back in november saw @entity17 running at half - tilt			1
next week in west @entity85 @entity18 will start favourites			2
they will play better than this			0
@entity17 will travel in expectation , though			0
it wo n't be one to miss. @entity206 ( left ) , can and @entity27 appeal loudly after @entity207 appeared to handle in his own box @entity209 lunges in on @entity35 with his studs showing during the @entity37 semi-final first leg			2

@entity17 drew 1 - 1 with @entity18 at @entity3 on tuesday night
sides meet in @entity37 second leg at @entity90 next week
@entity8 ' men were brilliant during second half of match
they showed same relentless rhythm and high tempo of last season
@entity18 managed just two shots *compared* to @entity17 's 20
