scientists have mimicked natural evolution in a test tube to come up with an enzyme that may have been crucial to the origins of life on @entity6			1
the enzyme is called ribozyme , and it is made from ribonucleic acid ( @entity10 ) - a molecule that is already known as essential for creating forms of life			1
and , the enzyme not only reveals clues about how life may have begun , and subsequently evolved - the breakthrough could provide a tool for evolving molecules in the future			1
origins of life explained ? scientists have mimicked natural evolution in a test tube to come up with an enzyme that may have been crucial to the origin of life on @entity6			1
it 's called ribozyme and is made from ribonucleic acid ( @entity27 - illustrated ) - a molecule that is essential for all known forms of life scientists at the @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33 , created the enzyme made from @entity27			1
modern dna - based life forms appear to have evolved from a simpler ‘ rna world ' , in which molecules self - replicated and evolved			1
the newly - created enzyme works in a similar way			1
it knits together a ‘ copy ’ strand of @entity27 , using an original @entity27 strand as a reference or ‘ template , ’ according to the study published in the journal @entity48			0
but it does n’t clone a molecule that 's identical to itself			0
instead , it makes a mirror image of itself - like the left hand to its right			0
this means it can ' bond ' more efficiently to develop a living form			0
no research team has ever made such so - called ‘ cross-chiral ’ enzymes before			1
the emergence of such enzymes in a primordial @entity27 world - which the new study shows was plausible - may have been key to creating the first forms of life			1
‘ when i start to tell people about this , they sometimes wonder if we 're merely suggesting the possibility of such an enzyme - but no , we actually made it , ’ said professor @entity67 , of the university			2
as well as showing one possible path for life ’s beginnings , the breakthrough could provide a tool for evolving new molecules			1
an illustration of the western hemisphere in the early @entity84 period ( long after the first organisms evolved ) is shown biology on @entity6 evolved in such a way that in each class of molecules , one ‘ chirality ’ or asymmetrical feature came to dominate			2
virtually all @entity27 , for example , are ‘ right - handed ’ and called @entity27			2
the structural similarity of the enzyme to @entity27 makes interactions within that class more efficient - just as a handshake is more efficient when it joins two right or two left hands , rather than a left and a right			2
@entity27 stands for ribonucleic acid			1
it 's one of three important molecules that are essential for all known forms of life - as well as dna and proteins			1
genetic information in a cell flows from @entity106 through @entity27 to proteins			0
proteins are the workhorses of the cell , while @entity106 is considered the ' blueprint ' of the cell			0
it carries all the genetic information required for the cell to grow			0
@entity27 is essentially the ' dna photocopy ' of the cell , the @entity118 explains			0
when the cell needs to make a certain protein , it activates the protein 's genes to produce multiple copies of a piece of @entity106 in the form of messenger rna			0
these copies are used to translate the genetic code into protein , so @entity27 expands and regulates the amount of a given protein that can be made in a gene			0
this new study has produced a new enzyme from @entity27 , which mimics natural evolution and could help scientists unravel the origin of life on @entity6 ‘ scientists generally are taught to think that there has to be a common chirality among interacting molecules for biology to work , ’ professor @entity140 explained			1
but his original study three decades ago showed that self - replicators would have had a tough time evolving in such a mix. ‘ since then we ’ve all been wondering how rna replication could have started on the primitive @entity6 , ’ he said			2
the new enzyme was created using a technique called test - tube evolution			1
professor @entity140 and post-doctoral researcher @entity156 started with a ' soup ' of about a quadrillion short rna molecules			2
their sequences were essentially random and all were ' right - handed			0
' they deliberately set up the molecules to create a ' joining reaction ' - so the right - handed molecules joined with the left			0
they could then be pulled out of the solution , and amplified			0
after 10 of these selection - and - amplification rounds , the researchers had a strong candidate ribozyme			0
after technical tweaking , they had created the enzyme and intend on researching it further			2
professor @entity140 said : ‘ ultimately what one wants is to turn it loose , in the lab , of course , not in the wild , to let it start replicating and evolving and seeing what results			0

scientists claim to have mimicked natural evolution in a test tube
they created a new enzyme called ribozyme , from ribonucleic acid ( @entity10 )
this acid is known as being essential for creating all known forms of life
creating enzymes that behave in this way reveals clues about our origins
breakthrough could provide a tool for evolving new molecules
