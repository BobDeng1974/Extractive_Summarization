by @entity0 save the deer : a small but hardy group of protestors has tried to put a stop to the imminent cull they are not the usual sort of people to be found protesting outside a nuclear plant			1
but when the @entity13 reprocessing site in @entity14 declared it would cull 12 deer caught on its land , a group of outraged villagers decided they could not stand idly by			1
yesterday , 15 local protesters gathered on the grounds of the plant , waving placards in a call for nuclear bosses to show compassion to the animals			1
they carried flags , illustrations of deer and banners declaring ‘ @entity31 deer ’			1
organiser @entity32 said : ‘ it has been a peaceful protest			2
we would like them to move the fence and let the deer back out			2
culling is not the answer			0
’ after @entity13 recently built two security fences at the site ’s south perimeter , the herd of wild roe deer became trapped			1
seeking advice from experts , @entity47 , which owns the plant , decided the most humane and practical course of action was to cull the animals			1
planning to hire marksmen to shoot the deer , the company announced they would be killed by april			2
when locals found out about the plans , however , they got together to try to stop the cull			2
more than 1,500 people have signed a petition calling for the company to let the deer live and they are asking local @entity65 mp @entity64 to take the matter to @entity67			2
many of those who object are from the tiny neighbouring village of @entity71			0
have a heart ! the protestors called on the owners of the nuclear plant to free the deer into the wild causing a problem : the deer became trapped when two new security fences were erected at the plant the local @entity82 has also strongly objected to the ‘ unnecessary ’ cull			1
councillor @entity84 said : ‘ this seems a quick , convenient and cheap fix for a problem for which there is another solution			0
trapped : a roe deer ( file photo ) ‘ would it not be a better and more humane solution to temporarily remove one section of fence and herd the animals back into the natural environment ? ’ a local resident said : ‘ i am thoroughly disgusted at the thought of @entity13 wanting to cull the roe deer by shooting them			1
‘ i have myself had the joy and thrill of watching these graceful , gentle animals , and to my mind they do not deserve this cruel and sudden death			0
surely there is a way round the problem			0
they are part of our countryside			0
’ @entity115 , head of campaigns for @entity117 , said : ‘ this is a huge company that seeks complex solutions to difficult , dangerous problems as a matter of course – it can not be beyond their wit to release a handful of deer			0
’ @entity47 said it had consulted wildlife experts , including the government - funded @entity130 , in making its decision			1
a spokesman added : ‘ their advice to us was that deer are animals which tend to run and hide when spooked			0
‘ the experts felt that the deer would try and hide deep in the thicket and cause themselves serious injury in doing so			0
‘ this decision has been taken with the medium - to long - term welfare of the animals in mind , and is neither the most convenient nor the cheapest option available to us			0
’ defence : a spokesman for the plant ( pictured ) said it was neither the cheapest nor the easiest solution			1

herd of roe deer was trapped when the nuclear plant had new fences built
@entity47 said the most humane solution was to have the deer culled
locals were in *uproar* and staged a protest outside the power *station*
