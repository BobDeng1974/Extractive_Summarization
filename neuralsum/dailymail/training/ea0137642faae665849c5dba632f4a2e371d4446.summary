by @entity0 published : 03:08 est , 22 june 2013 updated : 03:21 est , 22 june 2013 @entity2 eavesdropping agency @entity1 has secretly accessed fibre - optic cables carrying huge amounts of internet and communications data , according to documents disclosed by whistleblower @entity8			1
the agency is able to tap into and store data - including phone calls and e-mails between innocent people - from the cables for up to 30 days so it can be analysed under an operation codenamed @entity16 , the @entity17 reported			1
the @entity19 - based agency would not comment on intelligence matters but insisted it was ' scrupulous ' in complying with the law			1
whistleblower : @entity1 has secretly been tapping into and storing internet and communications data via fibre optic cables , according to @entity8 the information is the latest leak from mr @entity8 , the @entity27 whistleblower responsible for a string of disclosures about @entity31 intelligence operations			1
the newspaper claimed @entity33 had been running for 18 months and @entity1 and the @entity27 are consequently able to access vast quantities of communications between entirely innocent people as well as targeted suspects			1
it means the agency has the ability to sift through everything from an individual 's phone calls to their internet search history and even the content of their e-mails and @entity48 entries			1
the newspaper said there were two principal components to the agency 's surveillance programme , called mastering the @entity54 and @entity55			2
it claimed the data was shared with the organisation 's @entity31 counterpart the @entity27 ( @entity27 )			1
mr @entity8 , who fled the @entity31 for @entity60 after deciding to reveal the @entity27 's secrets , told the @entity17 he wanted to expose ' the largest programme of suspicionless surveillance in human history '			1
' it 's not just a @entity31 problem			2
the @entity2 has a huge dog in this fight , ' he said			0
' they ( @entity1 ) are worse than the @entity31 ' the @entity17 reported that @entity1 lawyers told @entity31 counterparts there was a ' light oversight regime ' in @entity2 compared with @entity31			1
yet the leaked documents reveal @entity2 has developed the technical capacity to access the cables that carry the world 's communications and process the vast ocean of data			2
the newspapers said the documents revealed that by last year @entity1 was handling 600 million ' telephone events ' each day , had tapped more than 200 fibre - optic cables and was able to process data from at least 46 of them at a time			1
each cable carries data at a rate of 10 gigabits per second - giving some idea of the sheer quantity of information being processed by the @entity2 spy agency - and the operation is expanding further still as more and more cables are tapped , according to the report			2
surveillance : @entity27 whistleblower @entity8 said that when it came to ' suspicionless surveillance ' @entity19 - based @entity1 was ' worse than the @entity31 ' partner : it is claimed @entity1 is sharing sensitive information gleaned via @entity33 with its @entity31 counterpart the @entity27 @entity107 campaign group @entity106 's director @entity105 said : ' this appears to be dangerously close to , if not exactly , the centralised database of all our internet communications , including some content , that successive governments have ruled out and @entity114 has never legislated for			1
' @entity2 has a clear legal process in place to govern the interception of the content of communications and blanket interception is not a part of that system			0
' if @entity1 have been intercepting huge numbers of innocent people 's communications as part of a massive sweeping exercise , then i struggle to see how that squares with a process that requires a warrant for each individual intercept			1
this question must be urgently addressed in @entity114			0
' the fact @entity1 staff have been discussing how light the @entity2 's oversight regime is compared to the @entity31 highlights why we need a wholesale review of surveillance law , including the fact that there is absolutely no judicial process within the current system and the people making these decisions are able to hide in the shadows rather than face public scrutiny			1
' a @entity1 spokeswoman said : ' we do not comment on intelligence matters			0
our intelligence agencies continue to adhere to a rigorous legal compliance regime			0
' @entity1 are scrupulous in their legal compliance			0
' former @entity27 contracter @entity8 is facing up to 30 years in prison after he was charged with espionage and theft of government property by the @entity158 last night			1
@entity8 , believed to be holed up in @entity60 , has admitted providing information to the news media about two highly classified @entity27 surveillance programs			2
a one - page criminal complaint unsealed yesterday in federal court in @entity164 , @entity165 , says @entity8 engaged in unauthorized communication of national defence information and willful communication of classified communications intelligence information			2
the intelligence gathered via @entity33 is understood to have contributed to a number of arrests and convictions including a terror cell in the @entity175 who were jailed for planning co-ordinated attacks			0
it is also claimed to have led to the arrest of five @entity181 - based individuals preparing acts of terror , and three @entity185 - based people planning attacks prior to the @entity186			2
a source with knowledge of the work of the intelligence agencies said : ' it 's not about going through everybody 's emails or phone calls			2
it 's about homing in on criminal activity in order to lead the intelligence agencies to be able to take action			0
' the source said the vast majority of the data gathered was discarded , with the agency focused on the ' needles ' of relevant information within the ' haystack ' of material			0
the source said : ' what they do is scan the haystack of bulk data for any needles that could have national security implications			0
' all the rest gets discarded and is not looked at			0
the vast bulk of the data is not looked at in any detail			0
' the ' needles ' are logged and the reason for holding any information has to be justified , the source said			0
the logs are regularly audited and subject to scrutiny by the @entity223			0
a ministerial warrant authorised the process of scanning the data and the work was done in a ' proportionate and legal way ' , the source said .			0

@entity33 sees agency storing web and telephone data for 30 days
access to innocent people 's phone calls , e-mails and even @entity48 entries
collecting general public 's communication data as well as targeted suspects
sharing sensitive data with @entity31 counterpart the @entity27
@entity27 whistleblower @entity8 charged with espionage in the @entity31
says @entity1 ' worse than the @entity31 ' in terms of ' suspicionless surveillance '
@entity19 - based agency said it was ' scrupulous ' in complying with law
