by @entity0 for the @entity1 click here to find out who @entity4 captain @entity3 will be targetting at @entity6 @entity9 @entity8 captain @entity7 could n’t help but squirm watching @entity11 ’s gaelic football team lose a recent match to @entity13 the @entity15 world and his wife thought they would win			1
for a start , @entity11 are his team			2
he played for their junior sides until a knee injury ended his hopes of progress			2
but you can also imagine the uncomfortable analogy running through his head since the bookmakers and vast parts of @entity4 appear to have given up on the visitors making even a decent fist of the @entity8 at @entity6 next week			1
‘ the only worry i ’ve got regarding the @entity8 is that it ’s sport at the highest level and we all know anything can happen , ’ he said			1
captain @entity7 is worried about @entity9 's tag as overwhelming favourites for the @entity8 @entity7 caught the fear after seeing @entity11 ’s gaelic football team lose a recent match to lowly @entity13 ‘ that @entity11 match brought home the point			1
they were odds of 1/10 to win			2
i know the @entity11 manager , @entity44 , very well and he will have prepared his side as well as you could possibly prepare them , and yet they still lost			2
but that ’s sport at the pinnacle			2
’ @entity4 pessimism is focused on the absence of star players @entity55 and @entity56 , plus their best two on current form — @entity59 and @entity60			1
@entity7 , however , is adamant there will be no complacency			1
‘ if we do n’t win i can assure you it will not be because of that , ’ he said			2

we will be absolutely ready for this			0
’ @entity7 is at the @entity69 , where he had dinner on tuesday night with four of his @entity8 team — @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 — who are competing here at @entity77			1
@entity75 and @entity72 have been ‘ drawn ’ together for the first two rounds — do n’t be surprised if that proves a pairings rehearsal for next week — as have @entity74 and @entity73			1
@entity4 team are missing several key players including their main man @entity55 through injury as for the other two who were expected to play — @entity86 and @entity87 — @entity7 allayed any fears regarding their absence			1
‘ i know @entity86 was very keen to play here , ’ said @entity7			1
‘ but he ’s just become a dad and it ’s fair to say family reasons came into play and explain his absence			0
‘ i ’m sure he will enlighten you himself but i ’ve no worries			0
i know how motivated he is to do well next week			0
he ’s going home to @entity101 for the weekend and he will be refreshed and ready to go at @entity6			1
’ and the enigmatic @entity102 ? ‘ @entity87 is @entity87 , ’ said @entity7 , smiling			1
‘ he decided at a very late stage he would be better staying in @entity102			0
the players themselves obviously know what ’s best for them in terms of preparation			0
‘ the thing that makes me happy about his preparation is that his record shows he ’s a guy who disappears and then all of a sudden comes out of nowhere and plays well			0
’ ( @entity115 ) @entity72 , @entity75 , @entity74 and @entity73 are preparing at @entity69 @entity86 decided to sit out of the @entity69 after recently becoming a father @entity75 is the only one of the quartet present who was here for the @entity8 , and could n’t help but wryly note the differences , with the sun shining and everyone in shirt sleeves			1
‘ the ball is rolling , which makes a change , and i seem to remember there were rather more people on the bank at the 16th and 18th holes , ’ he said			0
@entity75 has n’t been seen for three weeks and has clearly been using the time well			1
in all he has lost 23lb since starting a diet at the beginning of august , and has been working out twice daily in the gym			0
@entity0 interviewed @entity133 while he was taking a massage at the 1985 @entity8 @entity72 has n’t played since clinching his place with a stirring victory in the @entity137 three tournaments ago and could hardly ask for a better tune - up than competing on home soil			1
asked about being a 38 - year - old rookie , he gave a thoughtful response			0
‘ you just never know when your time to play well will be , do you ? ’ he said			0
‘ i know at 25 or 26 i was miles away from being ready to play			0
but my time is now			0
i ’m ready to play , and i ’m ready to keep trying to improve in the future			0
’ @entity146 's @entity75 has lost 23lbs since starting a new diet in august @entity73 is thankful to escape the clamour for @entity8 tickets back home in @entity151 @entity73 lives a 30 - minute drive from @entity6 and has played a couple of practice rounds , but he ’s one home - based scot who ’s happy being south of the border			1
‘ i ’m glad to be back at work because it ’s all got a bit manic up the road , ’ he said , more a reference to the clamour for @entity8 tickets and the demands on his time media-wise than other matters presently concerning his nation			2
as for @entity7 , he was only too happy to express an opinion on the other vote going on in @entity151 today , at the @entity169			2
