by @entity0 published : 07:15 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 07:22 est , 28 february 2013 a grandfather who frogmarched an 11 - year old boy home after his house was pelted with stones has been convicted of assault and ordered to pay the child compensation			1
@entity7 , 62 , snapped and grabbed hold of the youngster and took him to his mother and father claiming he wanted them to discipline him			1
but soon afterwards he found himself under arrest and in court after the boy 's family complained to police			1
it emerged during the court case that while banging on the door of the child 's home he ' accidentally ' pushed the youngster 's face into the door handle			2
had enough : @entity7 , 62 , has admitted assault of a boy , 11 , and says he is selling up because of anti-social behaviour aimed at his home at @entity31 magistrates court in @entity32 , @entity7 , a joiner with no criminal record , pleaded guilty to assault had to pay the boy £ 50 compensation as well as £ 215 costs			1
he was also given a conditional discharge for 12 months			0
but after the case the joiner said the process of going to court had been ' awful ' and he had put his home up for sale as a result			1
' it 's absolutely ludicrous that i have had to pay £ 50 compensation			1
i only went out to prevent my windows being smashed , ' he said			0
' in my day , the parents would have had a strong word with the child if something like this would have gone on			0
as a child i would have never of dared to do something like this , but it is obviously a sign of the times			0
' maybe i should n't have grabbed hold of his collar but my only intention was to take him to his parents			2
' snapped : @entity7 was upset after his house was damaged by stones so dragged a boy outside to his parents ' home , who called the police @entity7 said the area had been plagued with juvenile nuisance , with youths throwing stones at properties and running along the roofs			1
he added : ' it has been awful			0
i 've had to put my house up for sale they have literally forced me out			0
it has been really intimidating			0
' everyone i have spoken to can not believe it ended up in court , never mind that i have had to pay £ 265			2
' no regrets : mr @entity7 said that all he was doing was going out to protect his home and that what happened since was ' ludicrous ' the court heard the boy and his friends were playing in the street when @entity7 angrily came out of his home and grabbed a girl who started crying			1
he then grabbed the boy , although he had no evidence they were involved with any stone throwing			2
the prosecutor said the defendant was angry and he accidentally banged the boy 's face into the door			1
but @entity103 , defending , told the hearing : ' i have seen photographs of damage caused to his property and it was not a very pleasant situation			0
' mr @entity103 said @entity7 believed the boy was involved and when he went out his sole intention was to take him and the girl to their home addresses and ask their parent to do something about the situation			1
' he intended to have a reasonable discussion about the situation but the response of the boy 's parents was not good and an argument ensued , ' said mr @entity103			1
the family of the schoolboy involved said their son had been an innocent party who was caught in the crossfire			0
the 11 - year - old boy 's father said : ' my son had was really intimidated and was left with a bruise under his eye after this man lost his temper			1
he has almost become too scared to come out			0
' if my son does something wrong he gets told off			0
this man needed to answer for what he did			2
the fact he barely got a slap of the wrist is a joke			0
' @entity146 mp @entity145 said : ' i think it is important everyone has the right to defend their own property using reasonable force			0
it seems disproportionate that mr @entity7 has had to go through this ordeal when he was simply defending his home			2
