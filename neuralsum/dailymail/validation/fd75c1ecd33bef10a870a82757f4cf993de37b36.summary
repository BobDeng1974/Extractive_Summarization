for @entity3 manager @entity2 , tuesday 's friendly against @entity0 in @entity1 should have represented a triumphant homecoming to the stadium where he led @entity6 to three @entity8 titles before leaving last summer			1
after all , he remains unbeaten in charge of the @entity3 and saturday night 's 2 - 2 draw in @entity11 keeps them firmly on course to qualify for @entity14			1
but instead of being guaranteed a hero 's reception , @entity2 returns ' home ' beset by the same kind of problems that @entity0 manager @entity21 and @entity23 chief @entity22 will recognise all too well from the perspective of another struggling superpower			1
@entity3 manager @entity2 led @entity6 to a trio of @entity8 titles before leaving last summer a bitter club vs country row over an injury to @entity6 midfielder @entity32 on international duty has made @entity21 's spat with @entity36 boss @entity35 over @entity38 ' @entity37 ' and @entity39 look like a vicar 's tea party			1
@entity42 , an influential figure at @entity6 , said @entity32 's knee sprain on friday - originally diagnosed by the @entity46 @entity23 medical staff as ligament damage - was due to being over-worked and said : ' perhaps @entity2 would like to be remembered as the cherry - picker with the highest number of injuries			1
' it was inflammatory talk and the @entity53 claimed @entity2 had received death threats from @entity6 fans over the internet as a result			2
in addition , there has been criticism of @entity2 's decision to include two @entity63 - born players @entity64 and @entity65 in his squad due to @entity3 's declining homegrown talent pool			1
again , it is reminiscent of overtures made by @entity0 to @entity72 's @entity71 winger @entity70 last year , a move that was condemned by @entity75 star @entity74 and forced @entity22 into a hasty u-turn			2
@entity2 has come under fire following an injury to @entity6 star @entity32 ( right ) against such a malignant backdrop , the @entity53 will be relieved sensible ticket pricing means more families and less embittered @entity6 supporters will turn up on tuesday to watch two nations who failed together to qualify from the same group at last summer 's @entity86			1
even more than in @entity0 , there is plenty of navel - gazing , politics and recriminations going on			2
and @entity2 , 45 , remains half - irritated , half - cryptic about the gathering storm clouds above his head			2
' i have the memory of an elephant			0
i only ask to be left to work in peace , ' he said enigmatically after @entity64 had scored a stunning equaliser in rainy @entity99 as a riposte to @entity101 and others who condemned his inclusion			0
@entity2 is also certain @entity6 hold a grudge against him because he left in order to replace @entity106 at national level			0
the @entity3 players are certainly behind @entity2			1
without attacking stars like @entity111 , @entity112 or @entity113 to call upon , the manager has had to rely on teamwork , a 3 - 5 - 2 system with wingbacks , and loyalty to his squad			0
@entity2 has also been criticised for including @entity63 - born player @entity64 in his @entity3 squad @entity121 striker @entity120 has kept his place despite a run of one goal in 16 matches for his club and should be involved on tuesday night where he could face club - mate @entity128			1
' he ( @entity2 ) is a really good manager			0
in @entity3 , it 's normal people try to say something bad about the manager but the players have confidence in him , he has given us a lot of new ideas , ' said @entity120			2
' there are people who agree or disagree that @entity64 should have been picked			0
as players , we are glad he is with us because he has a lot of quality			0
i played with him for @entity143 and gave him the @entity145 shirt to wear against @entity11 because i scored in it last time â€“ i said it would bring him luck ! ' he is part of @entity3 now and he has to show he is proud of it			0
it has happened before and will happen again			0
' @entity121 striker @entity120 has kept his place despite a run of one goal in 16 matches for his club the reaction of home fans to @entity64 , who moved to @entity3 at the age of 16 , and @entity160 - born @entity65 will be interesting			0
@entity161 , born and raised in @entity162 , was jeered by some @entity164 fans when he elected to play for his adopted country , and @entity101 is among those to condemn the selection of oriundi ( immigrant @entity46 )			0
however , @entity2 supporters point out @entity3 's @entity86 - winning teams of 1934 , 1938 and 2006 all included players born overseas , the most recent example being @entity171 from @entity160			1
@entity3 needed @entity64 , named after the 1982 @entity162 @entity86 star , in @entity11 having surrendered an early 1 - 0 lead to trail 2 - 1			1
he was thrown on by @entity174 to salvage a point and did so with an exquisite turn and right - foot finish that would have done justice to the original @entity64			0
on sunday , @entity2 called up @entity180 defender @entity179 , currently on loan at @entity182 , and @entity183 to the squad to face @entity0			1
@entity32 is ruled out , @entity185 is doubtful with a shoulder injury and goalkeeper @entity187 missed out in @entity99 with flu			0
' it 'll be a prestigious friendly , so we 'll test out some players who i have called up , ' said @entity2 .			2

@entity2 's @entity3 side face @entity0 in a friendly game on tuesday
the @entity3 remain unbeaten under @entity2 's watch
@entity3 and @entity0 both failed to qualify from @entity199 at the last @entity86
