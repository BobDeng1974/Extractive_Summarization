@entity2 council said the traditional stones in @entity11 's @entity10 could ' cause problems for visitors and residents with disabilities ' and has ordered crews to dig them up next week , causing uproar among townsfolk and @entity18			1
the conservation body has strongly advised against the plan and urged the council to keep the cobbles , which historians believe are at least 175 years old and probably date back to the 1700s			1
rage : a number of protest marches have been held to oppose the cobbles being ripped up in @entity10 protest : campaigners opposed to the removal of the cobbles bear signs saying ' what next ? the minster ? ' and ' @entity35 to the council ' it said the traditional surface is ' important to the historic character ' of the market town , which is popular with day - trippers and tourists			1
residents have held 500 - strong marches through the market square and presented petitions containing almost 1,000 names in a bid to halt the work			2
however , town hall bosses said work will go ahead after they consulted community groups , including members of a disability advisory group , which were in favour of removing the stones			2

residents and historians have blasted the plans outrage : marches attended by 500 people and a 1,000 - signature petition have failed to dissuade town chiefs from removing the cobblestones legacy : the stones in @entity10 are believed to be 175 - years - old or more prof @entity57 said historic records show the stones were in place in 1829 and may well be from the 1700s			1
but the council says many of the cobbles - or setts - were replaced or restored when they were uncovered from beneath a layer of tarmac in the 1980s			2

the town 's @entity156 is renowned for its permanent collection of @entity160 paintings , a painter who once painted a portrait of @entity163 and lived in the town			1
a spokesman called the idea ' a crude , inappropriate scheme that will remove these wonderful landmarks and change the character of @entity11 's main square for the worse , forever '			1
he added : ' the setts , pavements , curbs and gullies are an essential part of the cultural heritage of this town and a major feature of @entity10 , drawing visitors from around the @entity181 and abroad			0
' @entity18 said @entity2 council asked for its advice about changes to the marketplace in 2012 , which also include upgrading pavements and increasing pedestrian areas as part of a Â£ 2.5million scheme			1
an @entity18 spokesman said : ' we believe it is possible to improve the market area and still keep the cobbles , which are important to the historic character of @entity11			1
' we were supportive of the proposals in principle , although we advised there were elements of the scheme which could be changed to be more sympathetic to the historical character of the conservation area and the 40 listed buildings in the area			0
' we advised that it was better to keep the cobble stones rather than remove them completely and only remove them where wheelchair access was needed			0
' this advice was given before @entity2 submitted their official planning application and since then we have heard nothing from the council on their plans for the area			0
' @entity10 's large market square is still used by traders and is lined with conservation - listed @entity217 , @entity219 and other historic buildings			2
