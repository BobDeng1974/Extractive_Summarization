by @entity0 published : 07:48 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 02:49 est , 9 september 2013 unhappy : @entity1 , 13 , was sent home from her school in @entity4 because her skirt , above , was made of banned ' stretchy ' material a 13 - year - old schoolgirl was sent home on the first day of term because her skirt was ‘ too stretchy ’			1
@entity1 , a pupil at @entity10 in @entity4 , @entity11 , had to go home yesterday because her skirt conflicted with the school ’s uniform code			1
the skirt , which was not too short , was deemed unacceptable because it was made of a banned ‘ stretchy ’ material			1
rules for girls say all skirts must be knee - length without splits or pleats , and not stretch			1
but @entity1 has also accused the school of singling her out , as she said other girls wear the exact same skirt but were not punished			1
she said : ‘ i really think it ’s pathetic			0
it ’s just the material , and it does n’t affect my learning			0
i felt singled out by the teachers , and it ’s only the first day of school			2
‘ i know other girls who have the same skirt as i do , but they have n’t been told they would be put in isolation or sent home			1
‘ i really enjoyed going to school at the start , but late last year , the teachers seem to be thinking more about uniforms			2
’ her mother @entity41 said the decision was ‘ appalling ’ and that it was almost impossible to find a skirt for her daughter which complies with the rules			2
‘ i could n’t believe it when the school called me up			2
how is the skirt too short , when it goes to her knees ? ’ she said			2
‘ they told me it was made of stretchy material , and not acceptable			0
i spent the entire summer holidays trying to find one to fit her as she is so small			0
‘ now they ’ve told her they would let her return if she wears the same trousers which they said last year were unacceptable ! it ’s really a case of double standards			0
i just do n’t understand it			0
not impressed : @entity1 's mother @entity41 ( left ) attacked the decision to send her daughter home , and said it was difficult to find a skirt that complies with the rules ‘ the school really needs to concentrate more on the education , and less on the pupils ’ uniform			1
i think she is old enough and sensible enough to decide what she wants to wear to school			2
’ as well as @entity1 , @entity10 sent two other students home on their first day for having inappropriately dyed hair			1
the school , which an @entity83 inspection this year said ' requires improvement ' , has been criticised before for sending home a student for wearing the wrong shoes , even though he had broken his toe the previous day			1
principal @entity89 said : ‘ we have been very clear with our students about uniform expectations			0
education : @entity10 , pictured , has a strict uniform policy , but inspectors have warned it about poor performance ‘ we have demonstrated what is acceptable and what is not			1
we have had assemblies on this and written to parents			0
' i really think it ’s pathetic			0
i felt singled out by the teachers , and it ’s only the first day of school ' @entity1 ‘ the academy has high standards which we are intent on maintaining			1
we have a parents ’ forum where issues such as this can be raised and we encourage parents to join this			0
‘ alongside this , we have a procedure for any complaints from parents that we encourage them to follow whenever necessary			0
‘ out of 1,000 students in the academy , the vast majority adhere to our policies and practices and accept them fully			0

@entity1 sent home from @entity10 in @entity4
but *teenager* *insisted* other girls get away with wearing the same skirt
@entity83 has ordered school to improve because of low *achievement* levels
