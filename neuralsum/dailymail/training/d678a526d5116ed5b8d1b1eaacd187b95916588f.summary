they may look like exotic plants , but in fact these incredible pictures are close - ups of tiny fragments of coral			0
@entity8 student @entity7 , 26 , was given access to studios owned by aquarists and coral collectors to take the photographs			1
the incredible layered images of tiny pieces of coral show a fascinating range of colours and symmetrical shapes			2

mr @entity7 , from @entity35 , @entity34 , opted to use studios rather than a sea dive to capture the detailed colours and structure of the complex corals			1

each piece is from the @entity32 or other reefs around @entity34 , including this pretty piece of @entity48 coral that seems to glow in places mr @entity7 , from @entity35 , @entity34 , opted to use studios rather than a sea dive to capture the detailed colours and structure of the complex corals like this piece of yellow coral ' i wanted to try advanced photography and illumination techniques on such fascinating and mysterious animals as corals - something that is nearly impossible to perform on a dive			1
' that is why i became interested in getting access to corals collected from the @entity32			0
' in @entity34 this kind of business is popular - private companies organise dives , collect corals from the reef and sell fragments to aquarists in @entity34 and abroad			2

' this piece of @entity77 coral almost looks like a shot from inside the human body this piece of @entity81 coral looks like a strange flower			0
the fragment came from collections of coral samples , which are popular as private companies organise dives , collect corals from the reef and sell fragments to aquarists in @entity34 and abroad ' it is legal and monitored by environmental researchers and does not threaten reefs			1
' mr @entity7 spent four months photographing corals and due to the complexity of the techniques he used , would spend up to 10 hours to produce one or two images			1
some of the pieces were no bigger than 2cm and high magnification was needed			1
mr @entity7 spent four months photographing corals and due to the complexity of the techniques he used , would spend up to 10 hours to produce one or two images some of the pieces were no bigger than 2cm and high magnification was needed , such as to capture this @entity81 coral with its intriguing microscopic spines however , to capture the rainbow of colours , a special torch was used to light up the corals			1
according to mr @entity7 , an advanced full - spectrum light , rather than normal white light from a torch , allows the different colours to be made visible			0
he said : ' corals , even the biggest ones , have details , which would escape our attention			0
the marine biology student used an advanced full - spectrum light , rather than normal white light from a torch , to photograph the different colours in this sample of @entity121 in all its glory he originally planned on photographing coral underwater , but knew he would need precise motion and a camera positioned on something solid , which is next to impossible underwater ' i thought that corals would be especially fascinating but the technique requires precise motion and the camera has to be positioned on something solid , which is next to impossible underwater			1
' however , capturing the colours was my second reason to go for studio photography instead of diving			0
' many representatives of marine life possess fluorescent pigments , which are responsible for their colour , but they do n't reflect light similarly to substances that are familiar to us			0

this fragment of reverse prism favia coral almost appears to glow under a normal white torch light most corals like this spiky coral would look brown and colourless but the moment you shine full - spectrum light on them , they light up with an entire rainbow of colours , according to mr @entity7 ' for example , grass is green because it reflects green light whereas a fluorescent pigment is capable of transforming blue light from the water into green			1
' thus a coral can be green even when there 's no green light to reflect , ' he explained			0

@entity7 photographed the corals in studios owned by aquarists and coral collectors instead of underwater
he spent four months photographing the *specimens* due to the complexity of the techniques he used , including high magnification , and spent up to 10 hours producing one or two images
