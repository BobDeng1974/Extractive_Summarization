by @entity0 published : 08:20 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 09:53 est , 14 march 2013 a controversial marketing stunt in which homeless people were paid to act as walking wifi hotspots at a festival appears to have paid off - after they used the money to find housing			1
branding agency @entity7 gave a mobile a @entity10 device to each participant and paid them $ 50 a day to walk around the @entity14 music and technology festival in @entity15 , @entity16 , with t - shirts saying ' i 'm a 4g hotspot '			1
it was suggested users paid $ 2 for every 15 minutes and the homeless could keep all the donations			2
the controversial stunt was piloted at @entity14 with homeless people paid to walk around wearing t - shirts like this @entity26 was one of the homeless people paid $ 20 a day plus any donations he was given to offer people a wifi service the daring ploy , named @entity31 , was condemned by some as ' dystopian ' , ' shameful ' and ' patronizing ' last year - but yesterday it was claimed all the homeless people have since used the money they earned to find a house			1
the participants had @entity10 devices similar to this strapped to them which would provide wifi internet access to people on the move at the @entity14 festival according to @entity45 , the @entity15 homeless shelter that helped @entity47 run the project , 11 of the 13 participants in the event used the money , sometimes more than $ 600 , to put security deposits down on apartments in @entity15			1
all of them now have housing , @entity52 of @entity45 said			2
she told @entity55 that although there had been controversy during the 2012 festival , the outcome was worth it			0
' there was a lot of discussion at the outset , when the program began , about whether it was taking advantage of the individuals			0
but the individuals participating were really grateful for the opportunity to be productive and earn a wage , and it had this sustainable result , ' @entity67 said			0
the homeless people stood beside conference goers to provide internet via the @entity10 devices which connect to the internet via the @entity10 phone network and offer web access via a wifi network			1
the idea was spotted by a @entity83 reporter , and swiftly caused outcry			0
technology magazine @entity85 described the stunt as ' dystopian '			0
@entity88 wrote that homeless were turned into ' not just walking , talking hotspots , but walking , talking billboards for a program that does n't care anything at all about them or their future			0
' @entity97 brand strategist @entity96 lambasted the idea as ' shameful , hideous , patronising and dehumanising '			1
@entity99 told @entity55 at the time : ' i 've swallowed my pride , at first i was a bit embarrassed about it			0
but being homeless has given me a different outlook about people			2
