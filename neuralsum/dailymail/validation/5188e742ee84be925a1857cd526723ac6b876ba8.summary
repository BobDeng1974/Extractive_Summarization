@entity2 ’s fourth @entity1 runners - up finish in a row has been labelled ‘ unacceptable ’ by @entity5 chief executive @entity4 , with head coach @entity6 told performances must improve before the @entity8			1
@entity10 ’s men suffered heartache as their thrilling 55 - 35 victory over @entity13 on saturday saw them fall six points short of overhauling @entity15 and securing a first title since 2011			1
but @entity4 said : ‘ four years as runners - up is not acceptable and we are not happy with how that came about			1
we should be winning more in terms of @entity20 , @entity1 championships , other things			1
@entity2 are left reeling on the pitch as their 55 - 35 victory against @entity13 failed to secure the title captain @entity25 ( fourth right ) looks dejected after @entity2 concede a try to @entity13 at @entity28 @entity6 ( left ) and his players ponder a second - placed finish for a fourth successive season ‘ we had opportunities , let ’s be clear — entirely in our control			1
the @entity35 deserved the win because of what they did over the five matches			0
we did not do enough			0
there ’s no point in bleating about it			0
‘ we did n’t take opportunities , did n’t do what we should have done , were not clever enough during parts of the game to deserve to win			0
’ but there was more than a little sense that @entity4 was playing to his audience at @entity28			1
and not only because the @entity5 ’s affable chief executive quoted @entity50 when describing the ‘ slings and arrows of outrageous fortune ’ he experienced watching the engrossing @entity1 denouement			1
his public pronouncements were designed to strike a chord with those still uncomfortable with the six - year contracts served to @entity2 ’s coaches last year			1
they were also designed as a shot across head coach @entity6 ’s bows			2
@entity5 chief executive @entity4 ( right ) chats to @entity10 at @entity2 's base in @entity64 in @entity65 @entity4 ( left ) and @entity10 talk in the @entity28 stands prior to @entity2 's clash with @entity68 @entity4 , an intelligent and thoughtful man , needed very little pressing to deliver the headline - grabbing line that @entity2 ’s fourth successive runners - up spot under @entity10 was ‘ unacceptable ’			1
often it takes hundreds of questions to extract such strong quotes from a senior figure			0
it was almost as if @entity4 had decided what he was going to say in advance			2
this was no slip of the tongue			0
more a clever piece of brinkmanship designed to keep the pressure on @entity10			0
the aim was also to avoid accusations that complacency has crept into an organisation which has pulled itself back from the brink in the public ’s eyes since the dark days surrounding the scandal - hit @entity94 campaign			2
@entity4 , the man at the top of an organisation now delivering everywhere but on the pitch , felt the need to crack the whip			2
‘ four years as runners - up is not acceptable and we are not happy with how that came about , ’ said the former chief executive of the @entity103			1
‘ if you go back through history , bearing in mind a lot of things , we should be , as a country , winning more in terms of @entity20 , @entity1 championships , other things			2
we had opportunities , let ’s be clear — entirely in our control			0
the @entity35 deserved the win because of what they did over the five matches			0
‘ we did not do enough over the five matches			0
there ’s no point in bleating about it			0
we simply did n’t take opportunities , did n’t do what we should have done , were not clever enough during parts of the game to deserve to win			0
’ @entity2 winger @entity128 bursts through for the first of his two tries against @entity13 in six months , the @entity5 will host a tournament which is predicted to generate close to £ 1billion for the @entity133 economy			1
success for the home nation on the field is critical for fans , sponsors , media and administrators alike			0
the @entity5 ’s strategic vision , which @entity4 helped draw up , decreed that @entity2 should head into the @entity8 with a @entity1 title under their belt and a world ranking no lower than second			1
for all the brilliance of saturday ’s seven - try triumph over @entity13 , watched by 9.6million on terrestrial television , they have achieved neither			1
but the natural question if results are ‘ unacceptable ’ is ‘ so what are the consequences ? ’ surely there is no point having targets if shoulders are simply shrugged when they are not met			2
but , with six - year deals secured , the reality is that @entity10 and his tight - knit coaching team of @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 are going nowhere in a hurry			0
‘ it ’s quite right in any management to have targets , ’ insisted @entity4			2
‘ but they ’re not the be-all and end - all			0
you ’ve got to look around at the totality of what ’s going on , where we are and what we believe			0
frontline players such as @entity173 ( left ) and @entity174 were unavailable for the @entity1 ‘ have we missed some targets ? well , yes			1
we wanted to win the @entity1			2
we wanted to be ranked two in the world			0
‘ we remain confident and optimistic with a belief we can do well at the @entity8			2
we remain absolutely confident , happy and committed to the team that we ’ve got on the coaching staff			0
’ @entity2 were hamstrung by injuries in the build - up to the tournament			1
no fewer than 11 players were ruled out of their opening win over @entity186 in @entity187 and first - choice stars @entity174 , @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity173 were absent for the duration			1
@entity6 with his tight - knit coaching team of @entity161 ( left ) , @entity160 and @entity159 that resulted in the emphasis being placed on youngsters such as @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 , with @entity6 and his staff keen to highlight the depth that has emerged			1
but @entity4 , the man in charge of a union which makes more than twice as much money as any other in the world and has access to more players , added : ‘ “ we ’re developing , this is a development opportunity ” — i do n’t take that			1
‘ we ’ve got the resources , the talent , the ability			0
we ’ve got to make sure we come out for the @entity8 and deliver			2

@entity5 chief executive @entity4 *branded* @entity2 's second - placed @entity1 finish as ' unacceptable '
the @entity8 will commence in six months time
the tournament is predicted to generate £ 1billion for the @entity133 economy
@entity2 's seven - try triumph over @entity13 was watched by 9.6million on terrestrial television
@entity6 was without 11 frontline players for the @entity1
