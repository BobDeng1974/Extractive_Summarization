by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 11:23 est , 26 november 2012 updated : 20:21 est , 26 november 2012 wealthy criminals are being given millions of pounds in legal aid , an investigation has revealed			1
it uncovered almost 50 instances over the last three years of millionaire defendants receiving an average of £ 300,000 in taxpayers ’ money after exploiting a legal loophole			2
in one case , two defendants were handed legal aid of £ 100,000 each to defend themselves against charges that they had masterminded one of @entity18 ’s biggest ever tax frauds – although they lived in homes worth millions of pounds			1
in another trial , a fraudster received more than £ 5million of taxpayers ’ cash , despite owning a £ 6million property in @entity25 , @entity26			2
however , the scandal may extend even beyond these shocking cases			0
the quango which presides over legal aid , the @entity29 , refuses to reveal the exact amount handed in legal aid to rich criminals on the grounds that the information is ‘ private ’			1
scandal : tax fraudsters @entity39 ( left ) and @entity40 ( right ) were worth millions but still managed to claim huge sums in legal aid by using a loophole former director of public prosecutions @entity43 is among those who are now demanding reform of the legal aid system			1
he said : ‘ it ’s completely wrong			0
the taxpayer should n’t have to pay the defence lawyers for wealthy criminals			2
’ the loophole is a result of controversial legal rules , under which assets that have been frozen by the authorities can not be used to pay defence bills			1
this allowed vat fraudsters @entity40 and @entity39 to plead poverty during their trial and each receive £ 100,000			1
disgrace : @entity40 said he was penniless but while on trial was living at his £ 4.5million home at @entity65 in @entity66 ( pictured ) - one of the most exclusive blocks in @entity26 at the time , @entity40 lived in a £ 4.5million flat overlooking @entity69 and @entity39 lived in a £ 2.2million home in @entity71			1
the two were members of a gang which set up fake companies to claim millions in @entity75 back from the taxpayer fraudulently			0
investigators found that they owned a string of luxury properties and expensive cars			0
@entity40 and @entity39 were jailed for seven years in 2007 and given additional jail terms of ten years in 2010 after they had refused to reveal where they had hidden their fortunes			2
fraudster @entity85 , who received £ 5million in legal aid despite owning a seven - bedroom home in @entity25 , was chauffeur - driven to court on every day of his trial , while yacht - owning multi-millionaire fraudster @entity89 was handed more than £ 400,000 in legal aid			1
in theory , the loophole in the rules is to enable assets to be preserved so that they can be confiscated after conviction			0
but in many cases criminals are successful at hiding their assets from the court , and escaping without financial sanction			0
convicted criminals owe more than £ 1billion in unpaid confiscation orders			0
leading legal figures told a joint investigation by the @entity106 and @entity108 ’s @entity107 that the rules should be changed to stop taxpayers being cheated			0
assets : the pair also owned a stake in @entity114 ( left ) and the @entity115 ( right ) , both in @entity116 , and had fought to hide what they owned @entity43 said : ‘ the government has got a real blind spot , because we have a situation where fabulously wealthy people are not being required to spend their own money on legal representation and are instead getting legal aid			1
i am talking about people worth tens of millions of pounds getting money from the state to fund representation in criminal cases			0
‘ legal aid has been cut for people who have housing problems , it ’s been cut for people who have welfare problems , people right at the bottom of the pile			1
‘ it ’s not fair that very rich people are getting legal aid and very poor people are n’t			1
’ @entity142 , the chairman of the @entity143 , criticised the government for refusing to release the figures which would reveal the full extent of the scandal			0
loophole : ( @entity149 ) @entity150 , @entity89 , @entity151 and @entity152 were all worth huge sums but still claimed legal aid when they were in court accused of various crimes ‘ this is something we have been concerned about for some time , ’ said mr @entity157			1
‘ this is another example of the taxpayer being made to take the burden when there are potentially funds there to ease that burden			0
that would allow legal aid money to go to those who need it most , ’ he added			2
a @entity172 spokesman said : ‘ offenders who can afford to contribute to the cost of their defence should do so			0
‘ reforms to asset freezing are being considered to ensure that both proceeds of crime and legal aid costs are recovered			2
‘ we want to collect more money , not just change how the money we currently seize from criminals is distributed			0

@entity40 and @entity39 were worth at least £ 30 million
they got legal aid at @entity190 trial while living in multi-million - pound homes
hated rule *prevents* assets frozen by the courts being used for legal fees
lord @entity198 : ' very , very wealthy people should pay . it is a no - *brainer* '
