' buy fewer clothes ' is hardly the cri de coeur you 'd expect from a woman who has made her name - and her career - from selling them			1
but today dame @entity4 made exactly that extraordinary plea - and directed it particularly at ' poor people '			1
the eccentric designer sat among celebrities and fashion journalists in the front row for her s / s14 show at the @entity14 gymnasium in north @entity15 , instead of waiting backstage as usual			1
it meant she had pride of place for the dramatic opening , which saw supermodel @entity20 performing an interpretative dance while wearing a flowing , @entity23 - style gown			1
everybody ’s buying far too many clothes			1
' i mean , i know i ’m lucky , i can just take things and borrow them and i ’m just okay , but i hate having too many clothes			1
and i think that poor people should be even more careful			1
' it does n’t mean therefore you have to just buy anything cheap			2
instead of buying six things , buy one thing that you really like			2
do n’t keep buying just for the sake of it			0
' i just think people should invest in the world			1
do n’t invest in fashion , but invest in the world			0
' act : @entity20 said she had been nervous about her modern dance debut , which she had devised with the help of a friend , but said collaborating with @entity30 was ' not even work ' @entity30 also urged people to take more of an interest in culture , saying : ' the first thing they can do , if they live in a town , is they can go to art galleries			1
' start building different values , where you engage with the past , with the human race			0
' the @entity66 collection for spring / summer 2014 saw models , their faces caked in black and white make - up , wearing the designer ’s trademark tartan , embellished with oversized corsages			2
eco-friendly : @entity4 often uses clothes to make political statements , as in this instance there were also @entity78 country garden prints and t - shirts printed with the phrase : ' @entity81 ' , the designer ’s political and environmental message making its mark on the catwalk			1
those watching included @entity87 actress @entity86 and singer @entity88			0
@entity89 said she had been nervous about her modern dance debut , which she had devised with the help of a friend , but said collaborating with @entity30 was ' not even work ' as she enjoyed it so much			1
' i ’m doing it for the love of it ... and to try to communicate the values we both believe in , ' said @entity89			0
' i also did it because it scared me			0
i ’ve never danced live before			0
i think it ’s important to challenge yourself in life			0
' wearable : despite the climate change message , @entity4 offered up a positive vision for s / @entity108 on aging : ' everybody looks like clones and the only people you notice are my age			2
i do n't notice anybody unless they look great , and every now and again they do , and they are usually 70 ' on being controversial : ' the only possible effect one can have on the world is through unpopular @entity124 her sex shop in @entity125 : ' we wanted to create a feeling of being inside a womb , but in a sort of sex torture @entity129 looking good : ' you have a more interesting life if you wear impressive @entity135 feminists : ' feminists wish women to seem like men			0
' on fashion : ' i never look at fashion magazines			0
i find them incredibly boring'on the next generation : ' i do n't have faith in young people any more			2
i do n't waste time trying to communicate with @entity149 modern society : ' people have never looked so ugly as they do today			2
we just consume far too much'on the importance of looks : ' i think dress , hairstyle and make - up are the crucial factors in projecting an attractive persona and give one the chance to enhance one 's best physical @entity160 being a fashion designer : ' my aim is to make the poor look rich and the rich look poor'on being creative : ' sometimes you need to transport your idea to an empty landscape and then populate it with fantastic looking people ' on being intelligent : ' the sexiest people are thinkers			1
nobody ’s interested in somebody who ’s just vain with a hole in their head , talking about the latest thing — there is no latest thing			0
it ’s all rubbish '			0

' i hate having too many clothes , ' says eccentric designer after her s / s14 show , adding that ' poor people should be even more careful '
