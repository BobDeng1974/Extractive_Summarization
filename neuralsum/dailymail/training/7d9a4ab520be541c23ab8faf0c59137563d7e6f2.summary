the battle of @entity1 was especially bloody			1
as one @entity8 rifleman who survived it said : ‘ i had never heard of a battle in which everyone was killed , but this seemed likely to be an exception			2
’ blinded by smoke and terrified by the slaughter , 200,000 men fought it out in an area of little more than two square miles			2
men ‘ were going down like ninepins ’ , observed the @entity15 as the bodies of @entity8 lay piled in the defensive squares where they had stood			2
corpses of @entity24 cavalrymen and their horses lay in mounds nearby			2
history is about change , and @entity1 changed everything			1
for this reason alone , we must celebrate its 200th anniversary next year despite — or perhaps because of — the carnage , @entity1 changed the course of @entity8 and @entity36 history decisively			1
it was the battle on june 18 , 1815 when an @entity39 army under the @entity15 broke the back of @entity42 ’s army , which was then swept from the battlefield by @entity45 ’s @entity44			1
the @entity24 dictator escaped on what was the first stage of a flight that would end at @entity49 in the @entity50 , where he brooded sourly in exile over his past glories and wondered what had gone wrong			2
for @entity24 and the rest of @entity36 , his defeat marked the end of over 20 years of war that had devastated the @entity59 as he tried to subjugate it to his despotic rule			2
from @entity64 to @entity65 , there were ruined cities , towns and villages ; hundreds of thousands had died in battle and from the epidemics spread by diseased soldiers ; and there had been famines caused by plundering armies that lived off the land			2
forget the glamourous uniforms of the fighting men , the napoleonic wars had been a mass human catastrophe			2
reputation : since she replaced @entity83 in the summer , mrs @entity82 has become known as ‘ ms u-turn ’ for reversing a number of policies and @entity1 brought them to an end — ushering in nearly 40 years of peace and reconstruction for @entity36 and marking the beginning of the ‘ @entity8 century ’ , a time of industrial innovation and growth , expansion overseas and maritime supremacy			1
@entity97 ruled the waves and @entity8 became the ‘ workshop of the world ’ as well as its banker			2
history is about change , and @entity1 changed everything			1
for this reason alone , we must celebrate its 200th anniversary next year in the same way as we are celebrating , though ruefully , the anniversaries of @entity107 i. yet the deliverance and remaking of @entity36 are deemed of little account at the @entity114			1
what happened at @entity1 appears a matter of indifference to the department ’s secretary of state @entity118 , who recently spurned requests to discuss how the battle might be commemorated in schools			1
perhaps the snub was provoked by the @entity125 ’ tendency , a body of drab , glum folk who are hostile to anything that may smack of patriotism			2
they are repelled by history that includes flashing sabres — particularly if it involves a battle won by a @entity138 aristocrat in the @entity139 , who opposed parliamentary reform			0
flourish to them , the history of the industrial working class is infinitely preferable — as long as it does not embrace those working men who wore a red coat and went to war led by @entity149 officers			0
the defeat of @entity42 involved men and women from all backgrounds			1
black sailors , some former slaves , manned the yardarms and cannon of the @entity158 ’s warships			0
scene from 1970 film @entity1 yet this is a dismally myopic view			1
the napoleonic wars gave huge impetus to the @entity164 : steam engines powered the machines that made the ropes for @entity169 ’s battleships and @entity171 artillery rockets were mass - produced in factories			0
and their conclusion allowed @entity8 industry to flourish across the globe			0
the @entity177 who reaped the rewards of @entity1 understood this , which is why prints of dramatic scenes from the battle hung in thousands of drawing rooms and why @entity15 received a magnificent state funeral			1
the defeat of @entity42 involved men and women from all backgrounds			1
black sailors , some former slaves , manned the yardarms and cannon of the @entity158 ’s warships			0
@entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193 soldiers held the line at @entity1			1
some were volunteers , but many enlisted out of poverty , desperation or a chance to blow the bounty money they earned in battle on beer and brandy			0
the history of @entity1 and the war it ended offers a wonderful opportunity for pupils of all ages to connect with the past			1
soldiers kept diaries , wrote letters or , if they survived , simply remembered what they had seen and done			0
and in this way ordinary soldiers discovered a voice as never before			0
a voice that gives them a harsh , vivid and even comic reality			0
their stories are abundant and breathe life into history			0
a @entity225 remembers how his fellow recruits merrily staggered from pub to pub to their barracks , where they quickly learned drunkenness would earn a flogging			0
history enthusiasts gathered in in @entity232 , just south of @entity233 , in 2005 to reenact the famous battle on its 190th anniversary another rifleman with a reputation as a marksman is offered a guinea by a colonel for picking off a @entity24 general and gets a further guinea for hitting the general ’s aide - de - camp			2
soon after he is found drunk , having spent his reward on brandy , and is duly flogged			0
there are tales of how humanity and decency emerged during the horrors of war			0
a one - armed @entity8 cavalry officer recalled how he was attacked by a @entity24 cuirassier during a melee at @entity1			1
his opponent saw his empty sleeve , lowered his sabre , saluted him and rode on			0
and there are stories of pure courage : the bloody - minded sort is exemplified by @entity263 of the @entity264 , a former prize fighter , who drank well before @entity1 , cut down a dozen lancers , then fell from his horse in an alcoholic stupor			1
these were also women ’s wars			0
many followed their husbands into battle , acting as nurses , washerwomen and cooks			0
private @entity278 of the 51st recalled seeing ‘ a lovely young woman , supporting the head of her dying husband ’ , and hearing of another who had got through a dozen husbands during the campaign			0
destiny their men died in a brutal , all - consuming world war that ended only with @entity1 , its battles spread across the globe as @entity24 fought to extend and consolidate its empire			1
and the prime reason for this was the megalomania of one man , @entity42 , who imagined it his destiny to make @entity24 empress of @entity36			1
next year ’s restaging of @entity1 on the actual battlefield is set to feature more than 6,000 re-enactors despite the destruction by @entity169 of his battle fleet at @entity308 in 1805 , he refused to give up , waging war through the @entity311 peninsula and then turning his guns @entity313			1
in 1812 , @entity42 thought he could bend @entity314 to his will and led half a million men to @entity64			1
he suffered a crushing defeat thanks to the determination of @entity319 and the patriotism of the @entity314 people			0
but even this did not lessen his hubris			0
only at @entity1 was he seen off for good			1
the power politics of the napoleonic era are full of lessons for today ’s pupils			0
how and why does a man such as @entity42 convince himself and others that he has the power to change history ? sacrifice why did @entity24 die at @entity1 shouting ‘ @entity333 ’ when all was lost ? was @entity15 right to believe it was a prime duty of generals to win battles with as few casualties as possible — and given the carnage all around him , did he succeed ? after the battle , many soldiers were so deafened by cannon fire that they were spared the shrieks of dying men and horses			1
there was another sound , almost more horrible — a constant chink , chink , chink			0
it was the noise of battlefield scavengers removing the teeth of dead soldiers , which would be sold to dentists in @entity8 to be made into dentures			0
‘ @entity1 teeth ’ were much in demand for years to come because they came from young and healthy men — countless numbers of them @entity8 men who had died ridding @entity36 of a dictator whose downfall changed @entity36 ’s fate beyond recognition			1
surely our nation ’s children should be told about their sacrifice and this extraordinary battle — in all its gory , brilliant and utterly compelling detail .			0
