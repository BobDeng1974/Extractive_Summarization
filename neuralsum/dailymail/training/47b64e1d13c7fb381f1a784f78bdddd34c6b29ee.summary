but tourists will be spied on to such an extent that the @entity23 has advised them to leave their laptops and mobile phones at home , according to research by journalists @entity29 and @entity30			1

the programme , which stands for system for @entity53 , was first developed by the @entity54 in the mid- 1980s but was not ratified for official government use until 1995			0
a second programme called @entity47 was developed to monitor online activity in 1998			0

power : @entity47 will allow security services to bug the communications of anyone without having to show providers court orders allowing the eavesdropping planning : analysts said the authorities have been installing the surveillance devices in the @entity74 resort of @entity5 over the past few years ' operators do not know what and when the @entity39 is monitoring , ' @entity29 , who collaborated on the project with @entity77 , a research centre at the @entity79 and @entity81 - based charity @entity80 , told @entity83			1

the programme , which stands for system for @entity53 , was first developed by the @entity54 in the mid- 1980s but was not ratified for official government use until 1995			0
three years later , a second programme called @entity47 was developed to monitor online activity			0
under @entity47 - 2 @entity4 internet service providers ( @entity93 ) must install a special device - at their own considerable expense - on their servers to allow the @entity39 to track all credit card transactions , e-mail messages and internet use			1

separatist fighters from that region have been battling @entity4 forces for years			0
the authorities will be monitoring cyber space for words and phrases that could suggest an imminent attack			0
however , the level of surveillance will be such that the @entity160 , according to @entity131 , was moved to tell @entity161 planning on visiting the @entity15 : ‘ it would be better to forget your laptop or smart phone in your home country , because it will be intercepted			2
