top medical experts studying the spread of @entity2 say the public should expect more cases to emerge in the @entity5 by year 's end as infected people arrive here from @entity9 , including @entity5 doctors and nurses returning from the hot zone and people fleeing from the deadly disease			1
no one knows for sure how many infections will emerge in the @entity5 or anywhere else , but scientists have made educated guesses based on data models that weigh hundreds of variables , including daily new infections in @entity9 , airline traffic worldwide and transmission possibilities			1
this week , several top infectious disease experts ran simulations that predicted as few as one or two additional infections by the end of 2014 to a worst - case scenario of 130			1
concern : members of the @entity33 's office hand out fliers detailing the risks of @entity2			2
medical experts say the public should expect more cases by the end of this year ' i do n't think there 's going to be a huge outbreak here , no , ' said dr. @entity44 , a professor of infectious disease , microbiology and immunology at @entity49 's medical school			1
' however , as best we can tell right now , it is quite possible that every major city will see at least a handful of cases			0
' @entity44 is a founding member of the @entity5 @entity55 advisory board for biosecurity and chairs the @entity58 forum on microbial threats			2
until now , projections published in top medical journals by the @entity62 and the @entity63 have focused on worst - case scenarios for @entity9 , concluding that cases in the @entity5 will be episodic , but minimal			1
but they have declined to specify actual numbers			0
the projections are complicated , but @entity2 has been a fairly predictable virus — extremely infectious , contagious only through contact with body fluids , requiring no more than 21 days for symptoms to emerge			1
human behavior is far less predictable — people get on airplanes , shake hands , misdiagnose , even lie			0
pandemic risk expert @entity77 , a senior manager for life risks at @entity80 , @entity81 - based @entity76 , a leading catastrophe - modeling firm , ran a @entity5 simulation this week that projected 15 to 130 cases between now and the end of december			1
that 's less than one case per 2 million people			0
@entity77 's method assumes that most cases imported to the @entity5 will be @entity5 medical professionals who worked in @entity9 and returned home			1
warning : health alerts regarding people who may have traveled to particular @entity9 countries are posted in the lobby of @entity97 , where dr @entity98 is being treated @entity77 said the high end may be a bit of an overestimate as it does not include the automatic quarantining measures that some areas in the @entity5 are implementing			1
those quarantines ' could both reduce the number of contacts for imported cases , as well as increase the travel burden on — and perhaps reduce the number of — @entity5 volunteers planning to support the effort in @entity9 , ' he said			1
in a second simulation , @entity114 professor @entity113 projected between one case — the most likely scenario — and a slim chance of as many as eight cases though the end of november			2
' i 'm always trying to tell people to keep calm and keep thinking rationally , ' said @entity113 , who projects the spread of infectious diseases at the university 's @entity126 and @entity127			0
citizens : dr @entity98 ( left ) is currently being treated after being diagnosed with the deadly virus while nurse @entity130 was quarantined after returning from @entity9 in an article in the journal @entity133 , @entity113 and a team of colleagues said the probability of international spread outside the @entity9 region is small , but not negligible			1
longer term , they say international dissemination will depend on what happens in @entity9 in the next few months			0
their first analysis , published sept. 2 , proved to be accurate when it included the @entity5 among 30 countries likely to see some @entity2 cases			1
they projected one or two infections in the @entity5 , but there could be as many as 10			0
so far , nine @entity2 patients have been treated in the @entity5 , and one has died			1
seven became infected in @entity9 , including @entity152 , the first to arrive undiagnosed and the first to die			2
he was cared for at a @entity154 hospital , where two of his nurses were also infected			0
@entity152 , who was initially misdiagnosed and sent home from the emergency room , is @entity113 's worst - case scenario for the @entity5 a similar situation , if left unchecked , could lead to a local cluster that could infect , on the outside , as many as 20 , he said			2
the foreseeable future extends only for the next few months			0
after that , projections depend entirely on what happens in @entity9			0
one scenario is that the surge in assistance to the region brings the epidemic under control and cases peter out in the @entity5 a second scenario involves @entity2 spreading unchecked across international borders			1
victim : @entity152 was the first person to die on @entity5 soil after being infected with @entity2 ' my worry is that the epidemic might spill into other countries in @entity9 or the @entity183 , and then @entity184 or @entity185			1
that could be a totally different story for everybody , ' @entity113 said			0
dr. @entity189 , a @entity190 professor and director of the @entity192 , said he 's not worried about a handful of new cases in the @entity5 his greatest worry is if the disease goes from @entity9 to @entity184			1
' if the infection starts spreading in @entity198 or @entity199 , what are we going to do ? ' dr. @entity202 , founding dean of the @entity203 at @entity204 and director of the @entity206 , pegs the range of cases in the @entity5 between five and 100			2
the @entity63 prefers not to focus on a particular number			0
but spokeswoman @entity210 said @entity2 will not be a widespread threat as some outside the agency have warned			0
' we 're talking about clusters in some places but not outbreaks , ' she said			0
the @entity63 is using modeling tools to work on projections in @entity9 , but ' there is n't enough data available in the @entity5 to make it worthwhile to go through the exercise			2
' @entity225 integrative biology professor @entity224 said there are inherent inconsistencies in forecasting ' because the course of action we 're taking today will impact what happens in the future			0
' her laboratory is running projections of @entity2 's spread in @entity9			2
the @entity5 simulations run for the @entity237 had fairly consistent results with each other , she said			0
and they are ' consistent with what we know about the disease			0

rise in cases will be caused by those infected returning from @entity9
this includes @entity5 doctors and nurses - despite imposed quarantines
infectious disease experts said number of those diagnosed with the deadly virus by the end of the year could be up to 130
so far , nine @entity2 patients have been treated in the @entity5 , and one has died
