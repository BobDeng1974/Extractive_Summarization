however , two brothers in 1940s @entity16 arguably set the gold standard in stockpiling junk when they died entombed in their own clutter			0
@entity20 and @entity3 were killed by one of the many booby traps they had set to deter outsiders , but their bodies were hidden by tons of garbage and were not found for weeks			1
the brothers ' story began in the beginning of the 20th century but ended in 1947 when they died side - by - side buried under piles of rubbish that had accumulated in their @entity33 row house			2
@entity20 , the older of the two , was blind and was cared for by younger brother @entity3 at the house in @entity37			1
@entity3 believed his brother 's sight could be restored with a diet high in vitamin c so he fed @entity20 100 oranges a week			1
in the meantime , @entity3 began keeping years ' worth of newspapers so his brother could read them once his sight had been restored			2
what started as a well - meaning but misguided gesture escalated over the years into an out - of - control collection that engulfed their home and the brothers became recluses , prisoners in their own house			0
the extent of the brother 's junk collecting finally came to a head in march 1947 when the authorities received a tip - off that someone had died in the property			0

the two men were killed by collapsing debris stockpile : the authorities discovered an astonishing array of bizarre items collected by the @entity3 brothers at first , it was near - impossible to gain entry to the house			1
tons of debris - including old newspapers , phonebooks and furniture boxes - were slowly removed from the front foyer but rescuers found themselves blocked out by walls of rubbish			0
it was n't until a patrol officer broke a window on the second floor and climbed through that the first body was discovered , the @entity88 website reported			0
after two hours spent climbing through junk and debris the body of @entity20 was found lying among boxes and trash			1
however , his younger brother was nowhere to be seen			0
a massive hunt was launched , with the authorities searching places as far away as @entity102 in a bid to find the missing brother			0
however , three weeks later it dawned on them he had been under their noses all along , according to @entity110			0
