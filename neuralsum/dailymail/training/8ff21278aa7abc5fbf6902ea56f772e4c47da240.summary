by @entity0 @entity2 's win over @entity3 was one of the best games i ’ve seen for a long time			1
@entity2 were sensational and just blew @entity3 away in the first half			1
there were questions over whether they could cope with the pressure but they answered them all with a wonderful performance			0
@entity12 and @entity13 set the tone and were fantastic all game but after going behind @entity3 came back so well			2
they had @entity2 on the ropes and the home side looked almost ready to settle for a draw before @entity13 hit a brilliant strike to win it			1
glory days : @entity13 celebrates @entity2 's winner with his teammates on sunday @entity2 have won 10 straight @entity25 games , equalling their club record			1
it was an enthralling , end - to - end game and what the @entity25 is all about			1
now we have to wait and see what will win the title : the flair and power of @entity2 and @entity3 or @entity35 ’s defensive determination			1
@entity2 have won 10 in a row but they will have to break a top - flight record if they want to win it			1
@entity39 won 14 straight games in 2002 but that was split across two seasons			1
@entity2 could match that record in one			1
they have four games left and need to win them all			2
there is no room to slip up			0
excitement : flags and scarves are held aloft on a special day at @entity49 as @entity2 beat @entity3 tough day at the office : @entity3 's @entity51 holds his hands on his hips @entity51 's bad day at the office after his performances this season plenty of people were ready to say @entity51 was the best defender in the world , but sunday was a game to forget			1
he played a part in all three @entity2 goals , with @entity12 ’s sidestep catching him out so badly he had to pay to get back in			2
then he was easily brushed off by @entity63 for the second and made a hash of his clearance for the third			0
watching the masters this weekend you might wonder how the pros can miss a putt from two feet — it was the same watching @entity51 slice his clearance			2
it was something you would see in a park on a sunday morning			0
if @entity75 had made that mistake , i do n’t know if we ’d see him in a @entity3 shirt again , but @entity79 is such an important part of this team			2
the @entity82 had one of those days that we all have in football and he will want to move on , but for @entity3 it came at a big price			1
three - horse race people might find it hard to believe but i ’m sure @entity3 will have been pleased to see @entity35 win at @entity90			1
that win keeps the title race alive for @entity93 because if they had lost , i think he would have put the @entity25 on hold and focused all his efforts on the @entity97			1
big win : @entity35 players celebrate at the @entity100 as they pick up a crucial victory against @entity90 with this result , i expect @entity35 to go to @entity49 later this month with everything still to play for , which will only help @entity3			1
@entity35 play @entity104 in the @entity97 semi-final either side of their game against @entity2 , and with @entity93 ’s fixture complaints he could easily have focused on @entity109			1
but with that win the fight for the title remains a three - horse race			2
all to play for : @entity35 manager @entity93 will take his team to @entity49 later this month @entity116 rule winning at @entity117 ’s was a good result for @entity119 and goalkeeper @entity116 played a huge part			1
the @entity121 has been in fine form all season and saturday was no exception			0
he made seven saves in the game — more than any other goalkeeper this weekend — and has made more saves than any other goalkeeper			0
without him between the posts @entity119 might have struggled even more this season			0
safe hands : @entity119 goalkeeper @entity116 has been in fine form this season @entity134 drives @entity135 onwards @entity136 saved @entity135 yet again on saturday with a last - gasp goal			0
spurs spent a huge amount of money last summer and none of the other signings has looked up to scratch			0
but the £ 11.5m they paid for @entity136 looks like money well spent			0
his late goal spared @entity135 ’s blushes at @entity148 and it ’s not the first time he ’s led a @entity135 fightback			0
he scored the winner at @entity154 and when @entity135 went 2 - 0 down at home to @entity156 it was @entity136 who scored twice to get his team back in the game			2
jubilation : @entity135 midfielder @entity136 ( right ) celebrates scoring against @entity148 he has fantastic ability on the ball , good vision and he has that great imagination that @entity135 fans want to see			0
he has made the most assists at the club and also created nearly twice as many chances as the next best @entity135 player			0
@entity171 said he could be the club ’s @entity172			0
he has a long way to go to reach that level , but he ’s made a good start to his career at @entity178			0
the force is with @entity180 after two wins on the bounce , @entity180 have now got enough momentum to get out of trouble			0
they have not won two straight games since october and at the end of march they were five points from safety having played a game more			1
now they are just two points behind @entity190 and level on games played			0
with the fixtures they have left , @entity193 and his men will be optimistic of staying up			0
animated : @entity180 manager @entity193 looks as if he is leading his team to safety trophy a must for @entity39 i was not surprised by @entity39 ’s @entity203 performance			1
after the defeat by @entity207 the game against @entity205 was all about getting to the final			0
they were not at their best but they will be back at @entity211 next month as red - hot favourites			2
all the pressure is now on @entity214 because the club need silverware and they ca n’t afford to let this chance slip by			1
up for the cup : @entity39 players celebrate as they beat @entity205 on penalties in the @entity203 semi-final 93 - the omens are good for @entity223 ’ free - scoring @entity2			1
after scoring another three at @entity49 they have now hit 93 goals this season , their best tally for 50 years			2
in 1963 - 64 @entity2 scored 92 on their way to winning the league title			1
and at an average of 2.7 per game this season , @entity2 are on the march again			2
6 - @entity233 have now conceded a league - high of six own goals this season			0
@entity237 ’s against @entity207 took his career tally to five — only four men have scored more in the @entity25			2
sore one : @entity233 's @entity237 shows his frustrations after deflecting the ball into his own net 1962 - the last time @entity119 beat @entity156 away from home in the league was in october 1962 when they won a 5 - 3 thriller at the @entity247			1
0 - 0 - a scoreline you wo n’t see when @entity180 are playing			0
there has not been a goalless draw in @entity180 ’s last 46 @entity25 games , the longest run of any team in the league			1
24 - @entity233 had 24 efforts at goal against @entity207 , including blocked shots , but failed to score with any of them			0
only @entity35 ( 26 ) had more attempts.weekend			2
84 - no player completed more passes than @entity156 ’s @entity263 this weekend			0
the midfielder found a team - mate with 84 of his 88 passes , a success rate of 95.5 per cent			0
pass mark : @entity156 's @entity263 completed more passes than any other player this weekend 56 - @entity2 have been attacking teams from the off all season and they have now scored 56 goals in the first half of matches			1
they have also scored 22 goals in the first 20 minutes , more than any other team in the league .			0

@entity2 's 3 - 2 win over @entity3 is what the @entity25 is all about
@entity2 have won 10 straight @entity25 games - a new club record
@entity51 's performance came at a big price for @entity3
@entity35 will go to @entity49 later this month with everything still to play for
@entity39 need silverware and they ca *n't* let the chance to win @entity203 slip by
