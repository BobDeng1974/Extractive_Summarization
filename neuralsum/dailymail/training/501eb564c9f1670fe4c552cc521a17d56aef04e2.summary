‘ unfortunately , although it will clear up by sunday , the rest of the week looks cold and dry , and there ’s unlikely to be any warmer weather til @entity44			0
’ @entity158 , the @entity159 , said : ‘ it ’s going to be a real witch ’s brew of driving wind , rain and snow , which will inevitably cause disruption on the roads			1

’ he added : ‘ wherever you ’re going , take plenty of warm layers , check the travel reports before heading out and stick to the main roads where possible			0
’ the @entity176 said council gritting and ploughing teams would be out in force to try to ensure main roads remained passable			0
it ’s hard to believe that exactly 12 months ago we were in the grip of a drought			0
this was the scene today on the @entity187 at @entity188 in @entity189 , which was so flooded that the road through it has been shut			2
last march the river was dry and the road was passable			2
two feet of water was rushing past the measuring post at the side of the ford today , which alerts drivers to the depth			2

we do n't expect to be imposing any water restriction this year			0
‘ however , with the topsy - turvy @entity229 weather we ca n't offer a cast - iron guarantee with that			0
’ and spare a thought for these daffodils … these pictures taken 12 months apart show how the weather has affected the daffodil season			0
this field in @entity238 , @entity239 , was ablaze with the yellow flowers in march last year , but it is now a bleak , barren landscape after being blasted by freezing temperatures and a deluge of snow			1
@entity247 managing director @entity246 is now expecting a huge loss in income as the company battles to win contracts with shops when they do n't even have any daffodils to sell			0
@entity254 and green : @entity247 managing director @entity246 inspecting the same field of daffodils in @entity238 , @entity239 , on march 15 2012 ( left ) and today ( right ) he said : ‘ basically we 're four weeks behind schedule already and the way things are looking there will be a great difficulty in getting daffodils in shops for @entity44			1
