@entity0 and @entity1 were dropped from the @entity3 squad on tuesday night and @entity4 will be demoted to the bench for saturday ’s test against @entity7			1
however , @entity8 has survived a selection cull but is likely to be switched from his favourite fly - half position to inside centre			2
in response to defeats by @entity15 and @entity16 which have extended the national team ’s losing run to five games , head coach @entity12 has taken drastic steps to arrest the slide			1
@entity1 has been left out of @entity12 's match day squad ahead of @entity3 's clash with @entity7 @entity24 has been rewarded for his form for @entity26 this season as he pushes for a back row place @entity30 's @entity29 ( left ) and @entity32 ' @entity31 get their chance on saturday @entity4 , who was sin - binned in the second half against the @entity16 , will be replaced at hooker by @entity36 , while @entity0 and @entity1 have been ousted from the match - day 23 , with @entity38 and @entity39 taking over at scrum - half and no 8 respectively			1
when @entity43 names his line - up on wednesday afternoon it will also include the recalled @entity24 at the expense of @entity46 and @entity48 prodigy @entity47 at @entity49 for the first time , with , as expected , @entity8 alongside him at inside centre			1
@entity8 has been out of form after coming into this @entity54 series short of game - time but he has been given a reprieve as the management seek to try out a 10 - 12 combination which was so effective at age - group level			2
the @entity32 playmaker may be under pressure but his influence was lauded on tuesday by @entity3 captain @entity63 who said : ‘ @entity8 ’s a fantastic player			1
i ’m a very firm believer that any team with him is much better than any team that does n’t have him in			2
@entity0 has been dropped after making his 50th @entity6 appearance against @entity16 @entity69 suffered a concussion late in the match against the @entity16 ‘ he ’s been fantastic			1
he helps lead the guys			2
he spoke extremely well before the game			0
he ’s a great guy to have alongside you in the ranks			0
you need players like that around you in these tough environments , these tough games with the mentality that he ’s not going to be fazed			0
‘ he ’s been exactly the same this week			0
he ’s continued to work hard and he has spoken well already			0
he wants to go out there and continue to improve as well			0
@entity8 is a key pivot			0
‘ to single out guys ( for criticism ) is extremely tough			0
it does n’t come down to one person - it ’s a team thing and as a team we stick together			0
’ @entity30 captain @entity29 will be among the substitutes , along with @entity32 scrum - half @entity31			1
