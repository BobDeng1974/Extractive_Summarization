by @entity0 published : 13:04 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 03:04 est , 16 november 2012 the vast majority of @entity3 ’s traffic lights are dangerous and should be ‘ torn down ’ , according to the chairman of the @entity5			1
sir @entity6 believes the signals are a means of ‘ state control ’ which cause more accidents than they prevent			1
in an impassioned plea , sir @entity6 argues that as a nation we have become ‘ obsessed ’ with traffic lights and that if he were in charge he would tear down 90 per cent of them			1
sir @entity6 , left , believes that the signals are a means of state control which cause more accidents than they prevent interviewed in the december issue of @entity22 , he said : ‘ most accidents take place at traffic lights because everyone is looking at the lights and not at other road users			1
‘ we ’re obsessed with traffic lights in @entity3 , and in @entity31 there ’s a light practically every 30 yards , mostly with a clear street ahead			2
they ’re a very inefficient way of enabling road users to get around			0
‘ i ’d tear down 90 per cent of traffic lights			2
they are merely ways in which the state exerts control over us			0
they ’re also dangerous , ’ he added			0
sir @entity6 ’s remarks have not been met with wide approval from road safety groups			1
think you might be spending more time at a red ? you could be right			0
traffic lights have been with us since the 1920s but in recent times their numbers have exploded , up a third in the past decade alone some signals and signs are now being removed in towns across @entity3			2
mayor of london @entity53 has ordered a review of thousands of lights in the capital , and more than 20 have already been taken out @entity59 technical director @entity58 said : ‘ there is growing evidence that in many high streets and densely populated urban areas , a simplification of traffic control would be beneficial in terms of cutting accident numbers and improving the flow of traffic			0
‘ however , the majority of traffic lights fulfil an important safety role for both road users and pedestrians			1
‘ in many situations the removal of traffic lights would actually do more harm than good by causing far greater congestion , because it would take away the ability to control traffic flows to reflect changing demand patterns			1
‘ just imagine what traffic would have been like during the @entity85 this summer if @entity31 had n’t had the ability to manage traffic flows and priorities via traffic lights from a central control centre			1
’ @entity91 , head of road safety at @entity93 , says that traffic lights are ‘ essential ’			1
he said : ‘ although there may be some that could be removed or changed without causing too many problems , removing most of them would cause gridlock and result in more , not fewer , accidents			0
@entity59 technical director @entity58 says says a simplification of traffic control would be beneficial in terms of cutting accident numbers , but the majority of traffic lights fulfil an important safety role ‘ it is incorrect to say that most accidents occur at traffic lights , and when accidents do happen at traffic light junctions , it is not because drivers are distracted by looking at the lights			1
‘ there are many causes — running the red light , approaching too fast , not anticipating that the lights will change , following too closely , pedestrians stepping out without looking , to mention a few			0
’ however , professor @entity119 , director of the @entity120 , believes that there are now too many traffic lights on our roads			2
‘ if drivers think they are spending more time stuck at red , they would be right , ’ he said			0
‘ traffic lights have been with us since the 1920s , but in recent times , their numbers have exploded , up a third in the past decade alone			2
‘ @entity134 tuned , they play a vital role , but inconsistently set , they can be the source of immense frustration , especially where they are seen to unfairly favour one type of road user over another — for example , thousands of sets of lights put buses first			0
’ in 2005 , almost all traffic lights were removed from the @entity151 town of @entity152 , pictured , as part of a radical road safety experiment			1
the result was a reduction in accidents in 2005 , almost all traffic lights were removed from the @entity151 town of @entity152 as part of a radical road safety experiment			1

supporters of the concept believe that roads become safer as drivers , pedestrians and cyclists take more care in the absence of traffic lights			0
in the interview entitled ‘ if i ruled the world , ’ sir @entity6 , 69 , also says he would make a history a compulsory lesson at school , prevent any building over a hundred years being demolished and would stop building on green fields .			2

sir @entity6 says the lights are a means of ' state control '
' most accidents take place at traffic lights , ' he argues
but road safety experts *disagree* and say the lights are ' essential '
