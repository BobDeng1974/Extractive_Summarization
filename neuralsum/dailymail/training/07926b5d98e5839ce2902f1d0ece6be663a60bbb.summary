a thug who attacked his girlfriend in the street has walked free from court after magistrates told him a community sentence is ‘ tougher ’ than prison			1
@entity7 , 27 , hit his partner of two years in a drunken rage when a cash machine told him he had insufficient funds to withdraw money			1
he repeatedly punched @entity13 , 22 , in an assault that ended only when passers - by heard her screaming ‘ please help me ’			1
@entity13 was left with horrific facial injuries after her boyfriend , @entity7 , beat her up @entity7 ( left ) flew into a rage after being told he had insufficient funds and repeatedly battered @entity19 ( right ) in the face when police arrived to arrest @entity7 , he spat in the face of one officer and tried to gouge out the eyes of another			1
but despite being on a suspended sentence for a previous violent crime , magistrates sentenced him to an 18 - month community order with 200 hours of unpaid work and ordered him to complete an anger management course			1
miss @entity13 , who had once considered having children with @entity7 , said he had ‘ no remorse ’ and criticised magistrates for letting him off			1
she said she looked ‘ like a zombie ’ after the attack and still has the outline of a footprint on her forehead			2
she added : ‘ when i found out that he had walked free my heart sank			0
i was shocked and angry			0
‘ he definitely should have gone to prison			0
he had previous convictions , he had been violent to people before , he was on probation when it happened			2
‘ he resisted arrest , assaulted two police officers , caused criminal damage and that does n’t even cover what he did to me			1
‘ he punched me repeatedly , he did n’t stop – but that was n’t enough for him so he kicked me in the back of the head as i lay on the floor unable to defend myself			1
’ the couple lived together before the attack but now miss @entity13 says she thinks @entity7 should have gone to prison @entity7 , of @entity57 , @entity58 , attacked his girlfriend in nearby @entity60 , as the couple walked home on february 9			1
he had drunk several shots of tequila and at least eight pints and three cans of lager during the evening			1
@entity67 , defending @entity7 , said : ‘ his way of explanation is his alcohol abuse			1
it is n’t domestic violence , it is a random assault			2
he would come back from prison full of problems and there would be a vicious circle			0
’ @entity60 magistrates told @entity7 : ‘ we are going to take the hard line by not activating the suspension order			1
@entity82 [ @entity84 prison ] would be the easy option – you could get this over with in four weeks			2
but this way you ’re going to spend the next year - and - a - half addressing your behaviour			0
’ miss @entity13 , a shop worker , could not open her right eye for weeks after the assault			2
@entity92 , of domestic violence charity refuge , said @entity7 ’s sentence was a ‘ woefully inadequate punishment ’			1
she said : ' i was shocked to learn of the horrific assault on @entity13 by her partner			2
miss @entity13 has made a good recovery but now lives with her mother ' it is appalling that the severity of this crime has not been reflected in the sentence handed down			2
a suspended sentence is a woefully inadequate punishment for a dangerous and violent man like @entity7			1
' domestic violence is a horrific crime which kills two women every single week in @entity111 and @entity112			0
it must be treated as seriously as any other violent crime			0
it takes a huge amount of courage to testify against an abusive partner or ex-partner			0
' it is crucial that victims like @entity13 feel protected when they find the strength to take their abuser to court			0
violent men like @entity7 must receive punishment that fits their crime			1
until this happens , domestic violence will continue to flourish in our society			0
' @entity60 @entity132 was told that after @entity7 was shown injuries he inflicted on @entity19 , he said : ' i did n't know i was that much of an animal '			1
@entity137 , prosecuting , said the couple had been in a relationship for two years and started living together in @entity57 , @entity58 , in october			0
she said @entity7 began beating @entity19 by pushing her against the wall and hitting her with full force on the nose			1
@entity7 , who pleaded guilty to three charges of assault , was banned from contacting @entity19 for two years and ordered him to pay her £ 750 compensation			1
he was also told to pay £ 250 in compensation to pc @entity148 from @entity150 and £ 100 to pc @entity151 , who he attacked when they arrived to arrest him at home			1
after the hearing @entity19 , who now lives with her mother in @entity155 , @entity58 , criticised the sentence and described how her face ' exploded like an airbag ' during the assault			2
she said : ' i ca n't put into words what i think of him			0
he is scum , he has hit a new low			0
i never thought he could stoop so low as to hurt someone he loved			0
' i think the case should have gone to @entity168 because of his past			0
i had no idea that magistrates are three people who are n't legally trained			0
' at least if it had gone to @entity168 he would have been before a properly educated judge and the full story would have come out			0
' i work near him and it worries me that i might bump into him			0
i really , really do n't want to see him			0
' a @entity177 spokesman said : ' our radical reforms will see everyone released from prison being supervised in the community – including those serving sentences of less than one year			2
' if you ’re experiencing domestic violence , visit @entity187 for support and information , or if you ’re worried about a friend or family member , visit 1in4women .			0
