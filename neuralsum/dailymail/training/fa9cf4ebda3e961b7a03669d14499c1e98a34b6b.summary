by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:33 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 12:51 est , 9 march 2013 home secretary @entity2 delivered a major speech which ranged far beyond her law and order brief , setting out how the @entity5 can win the next election the conservative party must shake off its reputation for being on the side ' just of those who have already made it ' , @entity2 warned today amid warnings just seven per cent of @entity5 think @entity13 can win the next election outright			1
in a highly unusual speech ranging far beyond her law and order brief , the home secretary insisted the party could secure victory but only if it becomes ' the home of those who want to work hard and get on in life '			1
the major address at a conference organised by party activists comes amid growing speculation that mrs may has her sights set on becoming @entity5 leader if mr @entity13 fails to win an overall majority			1
it is likely to cement her reputation as a possible leader in waiting , and will delight @entity5 backbenchers who want the party to reconnect with blue - collar workers			1
damning polling released to coincide with today 's conference showed that three - quarters of @entity5 supporters think @entity42 ’s @entity41 will be the next prime minister			1
in the comprehensive speech covering trade , banking , industrial strategy , welfare , prisons , trade unions , education and training , car manufacturing and the @entity54 , mrs may repeatedly stressed mr @entity13 was the right leader for the party and had what it takes to be @entity58			2
but she stressed that the @entity60 needed to give people a voice , and offer them security from crime , foreign threats and everyday risks like losing their job or illness			0
' we have a good record and we have the right team			0
but those advantages alone will not be enough , ' she told the @entity75 2015 conference in central @entity76			0
' we have to become the party that is tireless in confronting vested interests , the party that takes power from the elites and gives it to the people , the party not just of those who have already made it , but the home of those who want to work hard and get on in life			2
' the comments will be seen as an attempt to help the @entity5 shed the image of being party of the elite , with opponents focussing on the privileged backgrounds of mr @entity13 and @entity96			1
mrs may looked unimpressed in the commons this week when @entity41 joked about her leadership ambitions mrs may added : ' we need to offer them security , not just from crime and foreign threats , but from everyday risks like falling ill , or losing your job			0
' we need to promise them freedom , not just from the state but from vested interests like unions , big bureaucracy and , yes , big business			0
' and we need to give them opportunity , by reforming capitalism and making sure our economy works for all of us			0
' mrs may said the @entity5 party could be an ' unstoppable force ' but only if if occupies the common ground , is tough on crime and immigration and reforms public service reforms and the economy			1
' by standing up for the people , by taking on anybody who gets in the way , by confronting vested interests wherever we find them , we will change the country for the better			0
and we will win the next general election			0
' the number of @entity5 members who think @entity13 win a majority in 2015 has slumped from 23 last march to just seven per cent now hopes of a @entity5 , or even playing a part in government , seem to be fading , according to a survey of more than 1,800 @entity5 members by @entity75 mr @entity13 is under increasing pressure to reassure the party that he has a plan to win the next election , after failing to defeat the scandal - hit @entity145 in @entity147			1
with the party still reeling from being beaten by the @entity151 @entity150 in @entity147 , @entity5 planning minister @entity148 , an arch - moderniser , said he had been ‘ thoroughly p * * * * * off ’ by the ‘ truly rotten campaign ’			1
@entity5 rebels claim his leadership could be pushed into crisis within weeks if the @entity156 fails to deliver and the party suffers a drubbing in may ’s local elections			2
amid rumours of cabinet ministers jostling for position , as mps consider life after mr @entity13 , @entity5 said they were braced for the loss of hundreds of seats in the may polls			2
several @entity5 mps have put the prime minister and chancellor @entity96 on notice that this month ’s @entity156 must prove to be a ‘ game - changer ’ which tackles the rising cost of living and gets the economy moving			2
but with barely two years until the general election , it seems many @entity5 activists have given up hope of victory			2
since march the proportion of @entity5 members who think the party can win an outright majority in 2015 has collapsed from 23 per cent to just seven per cent			1
according to a survey of 1,844 @entity5 party members for grassroots website @entity75 , almost a third ( 31 per cent ) think @entity42 will win an outright majority , nine per cent believe mr @entity41 will form a minority @entity42 government and a further 34 per cent expect a @entity42 coalition with the @entity145			1
changing places : more @entity5 now think @entity42 leader @entity41 ( left ) will be prime minister after 2015 than mr @entity13 eight per cent predict a new coalition between the @entity5 and @entity145 , while the remaining 11 per cent expect mr @entity13 to fall short of a majority but will lead a @entity5 minority government			1
two thirds ( 62 per cent ) think the hardest task facing the party is stemming the loss of support to the @entity151 @entity150 while 29 per cent believe trying to defeat sitting @entity145 mps to be the toughest challenge			0
@entity200 , editor of @entity75 , said : ' @entity5 members are not saying that exposing @entity42 is a less important task than stopping defections to @entity150			1
planning minister @entity148 said he was ' thoroughly p * * * * * off ' by the party 's campaign in @entity147 ' my hunch is that they are answering the specific question			0
' they worry that while the @entity151 people may be very open to believing that @entity41 is n't the right choice for these tough economic times they are worried that a large number of normally @entity5 - minded voters are going to choose @entity150 over the conservatives and it 's going to be difficult to win them back			1
' a 6 per cent to 7 oer cent showing for @entity150 at the next general election wo n't produce a single mp for @entity222 but it may be enough to prevent @entity13 from winning an overall majority			2
' key to @entity5 thinking is that if the election is framed as a straight @entity13 versus @entity41 choice then many @entity150 voters will prefer the @entity60 to @entity42			1
' the rise of @entity150 has spooked @entity5 strategists , who are planning to launch a detailed attack on the @entity234 party ’s policies in the coming weeks			2
however mr @entity148 , who was a key advisor to mr @entity13 during the early days of his leadership , warned against a lurch to the right			0
in a frank assessment of the party ’s ability to win back voters , mr @entity148 said the @entity5 failed to offer voters any hope in @entity147 and repeated the same mistakes it has been making for more than a decade			1
mr @entity148 told @entity247 last week 's @entity248 by - election had been a ‘ truly rotten campaign ’			0
the planning minister said : ‘ where was the hope ? it was as if modernisation had never happened			0
‘ we screwed it up			0
we did n't even screw up in a new way			0
we screwed it up in an old way that we have been doing for a decade			0
’ but mr @entity148 , an ally of the prime minister 's , warned plotters they needed ‘ their head seeing to ’ if they believed it was wise to attempt to oust mr @entity13			0
a separate poll by former @entity5 donor , lord @entity267 , suggests the @entity5 would lose 93 seats to @entity42 in an election tomorrow			1
the survey of more than 19,000 voters in 213 constituencies suggests a swing from the @entity5 to @entity42 of around 8 per cent in the most marginal conservative seats			1
it predicts the @entity145 would lose 17 seats to the @entity5 in @entity277 and @entity278 and 13 seats to @entity42			1
launching the poll at the @entity283 ' @entity282 ' conference in @entity76 , lord @entity267 said : ‘ i do n't want to see a @entity42 majority of 4 , let alone 84			2
but i hope this puts the challenge into some sort of perspective			0
‘ we have a long way to go to hold onto the seats we gained last time , let alone pick up many more			0
but things are slightly less grim than the headline polls suggest , and we have everything to play for			0
