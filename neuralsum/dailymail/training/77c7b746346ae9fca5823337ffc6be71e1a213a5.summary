american football fans were ecstatic when the 2014 @entity2 season kicked off last week but few expressed their joy more perfectly than @entity5 the dog			1
when shown a recording of the @entity8 and @entity9 in 2014 season opener , @entity5 could n't contain his excitement - as he well should n't given his four - legged status			1
@entity5 jumps and barks with vigour from the snap to the down , slightly less so between plays			2
and he calms down totally during commercial breaks			0
barking mad : @entity5 the dog prances , jumps and barks when @entity19 comes on tv @entity2 fan : @entity5 ca n't take his eyes off the screen as the @entity9 take on the @entity8 when his owner cruelly switches the tv to an old episode of @entity28 sitcom @entity29 , @entity5 is n't especially impressed , but the spring is back in the pooch when he turns back to the game			1
' @entity5 , did you miss football ? ' the owner asks			0
' i know i did			0
' from his joyous frolicking , it 's fair to say @entity5 did , too			0
though it 's hard to tell if he 's a fan of the @entity9 or @entity8 , who won 36 - 16			1
play ball : the happy pooch is rivetted by the contest between the @entity9 and last year 's @entity45 winners			2

@entity5 the dog jumps up and down whenever the @entity2 is on tv
the video shows the pooch jumping as @entity9 play @entity52
