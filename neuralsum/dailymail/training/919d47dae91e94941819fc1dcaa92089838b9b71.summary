by @entity1 reporter published : 04:55 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 06:06 est , 23 august 2013 disgraced cardinal @entity2 refused to allow his archdiocese of @entity4 and @entity5 to participate shamed cardinal @entity6 personally blocked an inquiry into sex abuse in the @entity9 in @entity10 less than a year ago			1
the probe had been agreed by the most senior members of the @entity9 hierarchy			1
it would have examined all abuse cases on file on behalf of the @entity17 ’ conference of @entity10			1
the hierarchy planned to publish the results of the investigation , but the then president of the @entity17 ’ conference , @entity21 , who resigned earlier this year after admitting sexual misconduct , objected			1
he refused to allow his archdiocese of @entity4 and @entity5 to participate , forcing the project to be scrapped			1
the disclosure has been confirmed by the recently retired archbishop of @entity27 , @entity26			2
he said : ‘ it was the intention of all but one member of the @entity17 ’ conference to commission an independent examination of the historical cases we had on file in all of our respective dioceses and publish the result			2
‘ this was delayed by the objection of the then president of the conference			2
without full participation of all the dioceses , the exercise would have been faulty			0
’ but now the inquiry is expected to be reopened , according to archbishop @entity45			0
in a letter to @entity9 newspaper @entity47 , which has been critical of the way the @entity9 in @entity10 has dealt with caring for the victims of sexual abuse , he said : ‘ i understand that , in the light of the criticisms the @entity9 has been facing , these audits will now be published			1
‘ i think they will go some way towards confirming that the percentage of priests involved in abuse is tiny , and demonstrating the seriousness and competence with which the @entity9 in @entity10 has been dealing with safeguarding in all its implications for many years			1
’ the letter is an unprecedented break with tradition , which dictates that discussions at the @entity17 ’ conference remain confidential			0
a source said : ‘ this clearly shows the full extent of the malignant influence that @entity21 had on the @entity9 up until a few months before he was exposed			1
archbishop @entity26 revealed it was @entity2 who blocked the probe ‘ what we are now seeing is a remarkable and candid revelation about the inner workings of the hierarchy which are normally never revealed			2
‘ there are those who have defended the @entity80 over what they try to characterise as drunken fumblings dating back decades			0
‘ that is very remote from the truth			0
by his own admissions , his misconduct continued while he held the highest office			0
’ another source said : ‘ given what we now know , some people are likely to speculate about why he blocked the investigation			2
who knows what his successor might find ? ‘ he has done enormous damage to the @entity9			1
those left behind are still continuing to deal with the fall - out			0
‘ there was a will and a willingness among the bishops to dig into the past and be as transparent as possible , but that was stopped by the @entity80			2
now the way is open to make progress and continue the independent analysis originally planned			0
’ earlier this week , @entity21 received a major snub when his successor at @entity4 and @entity5 , monsignor @entity111 , disclosed that he would not be among the three bishops who will act as consecrators at his installation next month			0
it is customary for the outgoing archbishop to be chosen			0
a source said : ‘ this shows the depth of feeling against the @entity80			0
’ the @entity9 of @entity10 office has been contacted by the @entity121 .			1
