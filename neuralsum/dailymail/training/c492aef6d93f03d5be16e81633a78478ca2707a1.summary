in yet another u-turn to placate restive @entity16 backbenchers , the government has promised a review into the future of civil partnerships five years after same - sex marriage becomes law			1
it will look at whether the partnerships should be scrapped – or whether they should also be offered to a man and woman as an alternative to marriage			0
the government has previously refused to countenance such a move , saying it would undermine the ‘ gold standard ’ status of marriage			1
but @entity16 rebels – estimated at up to 150 – said the change did not go far enough			0
they said they would still vote on monday for the immediate extension of civil partnerships to heterosexual couples – which they said was vital if marriage was to be extended to same - sex couples			1
rebel leader @entity39 , a former children 's minister , said he was confident of victory			1
‘ this amendment will not wash , ’ he said			0
‘ if this @entity12 passes through @entity43 as it stands , both marriage and civil partnerships will be available to same - sex couples , but opposite - sex couples would only have access to marriage			1
‘ this can not be fair to the many couples in loving , stable relationships who for whatever reasons do not wish to go down the traditional marriage route , but who do want a public recognition of their commitment and protections under the law that civil partnerships rightly brought to gay couples			0
’ the new government amendment promising the review was tabled yesterday			0
culture minister @entity64 , who is in charge of equalities issues , said : ‘ the @entity67 is about extending marriage to same - sex couples			2
questions have been raised about whether we should also extend civil partnerships to opposite - sex couples			1
‘ there are strong views on both sides of this debate , and we have listened to those views			0
we are therefore offering the @entity78 the opportunity to have a review of this area , rather than legislating now without the required evidence			0
’ government previously refused such a move , saying it would undermine ¿ gold standard ¿ status of marriage rebel leader @entity39 said he was confident of victory only three days ago , mrs @entity64 ruled out extending civil partnerships to heterosexual couples completely , saying it was neither a ‘ necessity or a requirement ’			1
she told the parliamentary joint committee on human rights : ‘ we do n’t feel there is either a necessity or a requirement to open up civil partnerships to heterosexual couples because there is no deficit there - there is no lack of an ability to be able to formalise a relationship in a legal way			1
' it is already there for heterosexual couples			0
’ gay rights campaigner @entity112 , who has campaigned for civil partnerships to be extended to heterosexual couples , said he was disappointed the move will not be implemented immediately and will only be considered as part of a review			1
‘ while the government ’s promise of a review of civil partnership law is welcome , it is unnecessary , ’ he said			2
‘ a majority of the public support the retention of civil partnerships and want to make them available to heterosexual couples , according to the government ’s own public consultation last year			2
‘ @entity130 and @entity64 should stop delaying and making excuses			0
they say their support for gay marriage is based on a commitment to equality , yet they are refusing to support equal civil partnerships for heterosexual couples			2
they ’re not being consistent			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity142 , said : ‘ civil partnerships were created for a very specific reason - to give same - sex couples access to legal rights at a time when society was not ready to give them access to marriage			1
‘ now that the time is right to extend marriage to same sex couples , it is also right that we should consider the future of civil partnerships			2
‘ there are strong views on both sides of this debate , and we have listened to those views			0
a proper review will allow us to look at the issues in a considered and thorough way , giving full consideration to the implications of any changes			0
