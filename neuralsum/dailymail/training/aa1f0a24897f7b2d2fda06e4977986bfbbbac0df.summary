@entity2 paid just £ 620,000 in corporation tax on sales of more than £ 1billion last year , its latest accounts show			1
the online auction site shaved tens of millions of pounds off its @entity7 tax bill by legally channelling payments through @entity9 and @entity10			1
the news will reignite the row over the number of global firms that use loopholes to reduce their tax liabilities in the @entity7			0
but @entity24 officially reported sales of just £ 164million and a profit of merely £ 12.4million			1
on this , it only paid 5 per cent corporation tax – or £ 620,000 – rather than the usual 23 per cent , after capitalising on generous @entity31 tax breaks			1
the company makes its revenue by charging fees to sellers and takes a small slice of the proceeds of their sales as commission			0
it also has extra charges for those who sell a lot of goods at fixed prices			0
@entity2 is the latest global chain to be accused of using complex overseas accounting to reduce its full tax responsibilities			0
yesterday , campaigners urged the government to close its tax loopholes			0
@entity52 , general secretary of the @entity53 , said : ‘ many companies making huge profits in the @entity7 are effectively deciding how little tax they will pay			2
‘ if the government were to close down the many tax loopholes that exist , big corporations and wealthy individuals would no longer be able to avoid paying the millions in tax the exchequer is owed			0
’ @entity63 has also been accused of sending money abroad to avoid taxes despite acting legally in its handling of funds @entity70 customers threatened to boycott the chain last year after it was revealed the coffee retailer had n't paid corporation tax in the @entity7 for three years fees paid to @entity2 by @entity7 sellers are sent to a related company , @entity79 ( @entity78 ) @entity77 , in the tax haven of @entity9			1
meanwhile , @entity2 @entity7 provides ‘ services ’ to its @entity10 counterpart @entity83 @entity70 and @entity63 used similar schemes to avoid hefty tax bills , and @entity86 was criticised this year for paying £ 11.4million in corporation tax after record sales of £ 10.5billion			2
had @entity2 paid 5 per cent corporation tax on its full profits of around £ 300million , it would have had to pay £ 15million			1
at 23 per cent , the bill would have been £ 70million			2

the retailer *'s* @entity7 office reported profit of £ 12.4million on £ 164million of sales
at five per cent rate , company was left with a tax bill of £ 620,000

critics have in the past *slammed* this *method* of banking as ' immoral '
