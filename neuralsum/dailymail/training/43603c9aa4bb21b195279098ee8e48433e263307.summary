@entity12 thinks the app will help teach people that computer - driven algorithms do n't necessarilly have all the answers in life			2

how do you respond ? ' ‘ have you ever posted on @entity3 , asking if anyone knows a good barber ? or tweeted to your followers asking if " @entity94 " is any good ? that 's jelly - a search engine that uses your friends - only more convoluted than ever before , ’ wrote @entity74 ’s @entity97			2
