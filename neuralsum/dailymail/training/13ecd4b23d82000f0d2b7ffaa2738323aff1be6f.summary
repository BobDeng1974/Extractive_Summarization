the businesswoman and @entity12 vie - chairman suggested the country ’s never - ending economic woes could have been avoided with more successful business leaders in the government			1
and she burnished her credentials as a future conservative high - flier , taking a swipe at @entity21 @entity20 who has grumbled about her smash hit tv show			1
success : @entity2 , @entity12 vice-chairman , called for more business people to go into politics ms @entity2 has long been tipped as a future mp – and even @entity30 leader – since she suggested she wanted to do her duty to the country			1

i want to get involved , ’ she said			0
but she rejected the idea of being parachuted into a safe @entity42 seat , instead preferring to defeat a @entity21 or @entity43 mp on the path to power			1
‘ i would never accept a safe seat			1
i would always want a difficult seat			2
being fast – tracked is not something that appeals to me			0
‘ i do so want to contribute to making this a better place			0
’ television : ms @entity2 defended @entity52 's @entity2 , where she acts as an adviser to @entity54 ( centre ) against claims it was unrepresentative of business life earlier this month business secretary mr @entity20 said he feared @entity52 ’s @entity2 gives a ‘ completely false impression ’ of what real on the job training involves			1
he dismissed lord @entity54 ’s hunt for a business partner as ‘ tv theatre ’ which could deter young people from seeking a career in business			2
but ms @entity2 , who acts as a key observer and adviser @entity54 , dismissed the criticism with a thinly - veiled swipe at the @entity21 cabinet minister			1
swipe : business secretary @entity20 complained that @entity2 could put young people off business training ‘ people who work recognise that @entity2 shows the real pressure , the hard slog , the teamwork and how dogged you need to be to get things done , ’ she told @entity77			1
‘ maybe people who are not working … or have n't worked for a while , wo n't recognise this			2
’ she suggested that the country ’s sluggish growth and grim future prospects were in part because too many career politicians in the @entity93 bubble have no experience of the cut and thrust of business			2
