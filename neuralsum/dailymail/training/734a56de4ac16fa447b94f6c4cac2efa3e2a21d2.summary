unelected @entity1 judges are making a relentless attack on @entity4 laws laid down over centuries by @entity6 , a devastating report warns today			1
a group of @entity10 mps are demanding action by the prime minister over figures which show the @entity4 loses three out of every four cases taken to the unaccountable @entity15			1
the explosive research will reignite the row over @entity19 ’s demand for rapists and killers to be given the vote in prison , and intensify calls for @entity4 to withdraw from the court ’s jurisdiction			2
relentless attack : unelected judges at the @entity15 in @entity29 , pictured , are undermining @entity4 justice by ruling in favour of murderers , terrorists and sex offenders in three in four cases taken there from @entity4 the ten backbench @entity10 mps say there is a need to ‘ end rule by judges and reinstate parliamentary democracy ’			1
their challenge follows a succession of sickening cases in which terrorists , murderers and sex offenders have been awarded cash after gaining judgments against the government			0
the report , commissioned by the mps from legal researcher @entity53 , says that since @entity4 subscribed to the jurisdiction of the @entity15 in 1966 there have been more than 350 rulings on whether the @entity4 has violated convention rights			1
the number of judgments made against the @entity4 is 271 , against only 86 in which it was successful			1
in a further 50 cases the @entity4 reached a settlement with the claimant , typically agreeing to pay out in return for an agreement to drop the case			1
in the 1980s , the average number of cases concluded by the @entity15 concerning alleged @entity4 violation of human rights law was 2.6 per year			1
in the 1990s it tripled to 7.8 – and in the 2000s it almost tripled again to 29.3			0
taking charge : @entity74 is planning to use a speech to call for rule changes which he hopes to implement during @entity4 's presidency of the @entity78 the judgments have been blamed for allowing scores of foreign criminals and terrorists to claim they have a ‘ human right ’ to remain in the @entity4			1
the @entity19 court has 47 judges , representing every member state of the @entity78 including @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			0
a recent report estimated that 20 of them have no judicial experience			0
many can not speak @entity95			0
the timing of the report is crucial as @entity29 prepares to pass judgment in three controversial cases			1
in the first , prisoner voting will come before the @entity15 , @entity29 ’s final court of appeal			0
@entity4 is fighting an @entity15 ruling that the government must allow convicts to take part in elections – in clear defiance of the wishes of the @entity4 @entity6 , which last year voted overwhelmingly to maintain the current ban			2
in the second , preacher of hate @entity111 is resisting extradition to the @entity115 to face trial on terror charges , and the @entity15 will rule on whether he can be sent for trial			0
if it refuses , the @entity4 authorities face the prospect of having to release the fanatic back on to the streets			2
the final case involves three killers given ‘ whole - life ’ tariffs by the @entity4 courts , which have ruled their crimes are so grave that they can never be released and must die behind bars			2
court battles : @entity132 's case involving his ' whole - life ' tariff for murder and a decision on whether @entity111 can be extradited to the @entity115 to face trial are two of the upcoming cases the @entity15 is to rule on if @entity132 , @entity140 and @entity141 win their case , it will force the government to give regular reviews to every one of the 40 or so prisoners locked up for ever – and allow them to petition for their release			1
report : former @entity151 @entity150 is the chairman of the group calling on mr @entity74 to take action in their foreword to mr @entity53 ’s report , the @entity154 , headed by @entity155 @entity150 , say : ‘ the main problem with current human rights law is that we all have to accept judges ’ interpretations of human rights , even when those interpretations strike us as a gross distortion of such rights			1
who really believes that some or all convicted prisoners have an inherent right to vote while they are behind bars for their crime ? not us			0
’ the report calls for the @entity4 @entity6 to be given the power to overturn @entity15 judgments			2
such a move would require the approval of all other signatories to the @entity15			0
should this not prove possible , ‘ the only viable option would be for the @entity4 to extract itself from the jurisdiction of the @entity29 court altogether ’			0
the report says that , by introducing a @entity4 @entity185 , the country could still meet its obligations to respect human rights			2
the author claims this would most probably prevent @entity4 from being ejected from the @entity78 – parent body of the @entity15			0
@entity74 promised at the weekend to take personal charge of the issue , during @entity4 ’s presidency of the @entity78			1
he is planning to make a speech in @entity29 calling for rule changes which would stop the @entity15 being able to deal with cases if they have already been dealt with ‘ properly ’ by national courts .			0

ten @entity10 mps call on prime minister to take action
say there is a need to ' end rule by judges '
in 350 cases , @entity4 has lost 271 and been successful in only 86
timing of report *coincides* with three controversial upcoming rulings
