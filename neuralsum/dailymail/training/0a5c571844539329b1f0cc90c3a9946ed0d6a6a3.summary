by @entity0 with bright pink and orange garlands of hibiscus flowers draped over their shoulders , bouquets of jasmine and , bizarrely , crowned with palm fronds , @entity2 's flower sellers are a colourful bunch			1
now a selection of the men are starring in a set of incredible new photos by @entity15 photographer @entity14 , which aim to shed light on a little known side of life in @entity20 's oldest port			1
shot in the @entity23 , a huge warren of stalls sprawled along the banks of the @entity27 , the project , entitled @entity22 , sees vendors pose with their blooms while looking impassively out at the camera			2
spectacular : a man appears to be wearing a crown of palm frond ( left ) while another flower seller 's body is almost completely hidden by his hibiscus garlands wonderful : a @entity2 flower seller stands with a neatly tied bunch of sunflowers ( left ) while birds swoop over the river while another vendor has his photograph taken it was this stoicism , says @entity14 , that first inspired him to start snapping pictures - that and the quirky contrast between the delicate flowers and their masculine owners			1
' i first went to the flower market during a visit to @entity2 three or four years ago and have wanted to do something on it ever since , ' explains @entity58 - based @entity14			1
' it 's a beautiful and , at the same time , very stressful place but i was fascinated with it - and the flower sellers in particular			0
i really like the way they carry their flowers , ' he continues			0
' sometimes it almost looks like they are wearing big flower dresses			0
i like that you see these strong and masculine men handling the flowers with so much care as if they were precious jewels			0
' @entity14 , whose work usually takes him into the grimier side of @entity20 life , was also enchanted by the flowers themselves , even if there were a few that he was n't allowed to photograph			1
popular : @entity82 is one of the most popular flowers and comes in a huge range of hues whether yellow ( left ) or a deep saffron orange ( right ) gentle : @entity14 says he was fascinated by the gentle way the men handled their flowers - a fact especially apparent in the photo on the right striking : a vendor appears proud of his gorgeous bunch of crimson roses ( left ) while another is almost completely hidden behind a huge bundle of palm fronds ' there are a lot of superstitions and religious belief in flowers in @entity20 , ' he explains			1
' i was n't allowed to photograph some of them because they were considered to be holy flowers and they would lose their power if i had			2
' among them are the blood - red hibiscus beloved of @entity114 , @entity116 's fragrant lotus flowers , @entity118 's champa ( @entity20 magnolia ) and the wonderfully named @entity120 ( yellow palash )			1
the men themselves , however , proved to be willing accomplices			0
' most of the people did n't mind having their photo taken - provided it did n't take too long , ' says @entity14			0
' all of the flower sellers were busy working and did n't want to lose any business			0
' he adds : ' hopefully , people find the portraits interesting : even though some of the flower sellers are poor , they are still very proud of what they do and i hope people can see that			0
' for more of @entity14 's work , see kenhermann.dk incongruous : @entity139 was struck by the contrast between the masculinity of the vendors and the delicate beauty of the flowers they sold curious : a dog sneaks into shot behind this colourfully dressed flower seller ( left ) while right , another has his photo taken in front of an interested audience			2

@entity2 is home to the @entity156 which is sprawled along the banks of the @entity27
photos are the work of @entity15 photographer @entity14 who has long been fascinated by the market
*traders* appear draped in garlands of cerise and orange hibiscus flowers and hold bunches of crimson roses
some flowers , among them the wonderfully named @entity120 , were thought too holy to photograph
@entity14 says the men are very proud of what they do and he hopes that is made clear by the portraits
