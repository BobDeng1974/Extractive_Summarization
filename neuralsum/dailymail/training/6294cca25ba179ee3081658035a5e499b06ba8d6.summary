an @entity1 scientist was today awarded the @entity2 for his work on quantum particles which could make it possible to build a new kind of computer far more powerful than any seen before			1
@entity8 and his @entity10 colleague @entity9 found ways to manipulate the very smallest particles of matter and light to observe strange behaviour that previously could only be imagined in equations and thought experiments			1
the 68 - year - old physicist has described his own work as a ' parlour trick ' that performed the seemingly magical feat of putting an object in two places at once			0
other scientists praised the achievements as bringing to life the wildest dreams of science fiction			0
winners : @entity1 @entity8 , left , and @entity10 @entity9 , right , have been awarded the @entity2 for their research into quantum particles delight : mr @entity8 following a press conference he gave to mark his winning the @entity2 in the lab : the physicist giving a tour of his laboratory in @entity37 , @entity38 on tuesday ' the @entity40 laureates have opened the door to a new era of experimentation with quantum physics by demonstrating the direct observation of individual quantum particles without destroying them , ' said the @entity48 , which awarded them the $ 1.2million @entity2			1
' perhaps the quantum computer will change our everyday lives in this century in the same radical way as the classical computer did in the last century			2
' mr @entity9 said he was walking in the street with his wife when he recognized the @entity57 country code on the incoming call which would inform him of the award			2
' i saw the area code 46 , then i sat down , ' he said			0
' first i called my children , then i called my closest colleagues , without whom i would never have won this prize			2
' asked how he would celebrate , he said : ' i will have champagne , of course			0
' he added that he hoped the prize would give him a platform ' that will allow me to communicate ideas , not just in this field of research but for research in general , fundamental research '			0
hard at work : mr @entity8 's research could help build unimaginably powerful new types of computers honoured : the physicist received the 2007 @entity78 from president @entity79 mr @entity8 , who is married with two sons , is a native of @entity81 and was educated at @entity82 and @entity83			1
he now works at the @entity84 and at the @entity85			1
physics is the second of this year 's crop of awards - scientists from @entity87 and @entity88 were yesterday awarded the medicine prize , for adult stem cell research			2
the prizes , which reward achievements in science , literature and peace , were first awarded in 1901 in accordance with the will of @entity57 dynamite millionaire @entity102			0
' this year 's @entity2 recognizes some of the most incredible experimental tests of the weirder aspects of quantum mechanics , ' said @entity106 , professor of physics at the @entity108			2
' until the last decade or two , some of these results were nothing more than ideas in science fiction or , at best , the wilder imaginations of quantum physicists			0
@entity8 and @entity9 and their teams have shown just how strange the quantum world really is and opened up the potential for new technologies undreamt of not so long ago			1
' announcement : the pair 's victory was first revealed in @entity123 on tuesday quantum physics studies the behaviour of the fundamental building blocks of the universe at a scale smaller than atoms , when tiny particles act in strange ways that can only be described with advanced mathematics			1
researchers have long dreamt of building ' quantum computers ' that would operate using that mathematics - able to conduct far more complicated calculations and hold vastly more data than classical computers			0
but they could only be built if the behaviour of individual particles could be observed			0
' single particles are not easily isolated from their surrounding environment , and they lose their mysterious quantum properties as soon as they interact with the outside world , ' the @entity40 committee explained			1
' through their ingenious laboratory methods @entity9 and @entity8 , together with their research groups , have managed to measure and control very fragile quantum states , which were previously thought inaccessible for direct observation			1
the new methods allow them to examine , control and count the particles			0
' @entity154 ! mr @entity9 celebrates his win in the historic setting of the @entity157 in @entity158 research : mr @entity9 working on quantum physics in @entity158 with one of his assistants both scientists work in the field of quantum optics , studying the fundamental interactions between light and matter			1
the @entity40 committee said they used opposite approaches to the same problem : mr @entity8 uses light particles - or photons - to measure and control particles of matter - electrons - while mr @entity9 uses electrons to control and measure photons			1
in one of the strange properties of quantum mechanics , tiny particles act as if they are simultaneously in two locations , based on the likelihood that they would be found at either , known as a ' superposition '			2
it was long thought that it would be impossible to demonstrate this in a lab. but mr @entity8 's ' parlour trick ' was to hit an atom with laser light , which according to quantum theory would have a 50 per cent chance of moving it , and observe the atom at two different locations , 80 nanometres apart			1
in a normal computer , a switch must either be on or off			0
a quantum computer would work with switches that , like the particles in mr @entity8 's experiment , behaved as if they were in more than one position at the same time			1
an example is a computer trying to work out the shortest route around town for a travelling salesman			0
a traditional computer might try every possible route and then choose the shortest			0
a quantum computer could do the calculation in one step , as if the salesman travelled each route simultaneously .			0
