at the time that the diary was written , @entity4 's sister @entity179 was married to @entity182 when he was the secretary of the @entity183			1

in the journal , @entity4 wrote that @entity182 could win due to his energy and focus , but ' he could lose because he lacks humanity and does n't love people '			1
ends up that @entity4 was right at the time since @entity182 's 2002 bid for governor failed but he went on to win in 2010			2

' i feel dirty around him , and i feel like i ’m being used			0
i feel like with @entity148 , it ’s all about @entity148 , ' he added			0
the timing of the journal means that it included the aftermath of the september 11 attacks			0
as a result , he included some withering reviews of the @entity118 response			0
he wrote that president @entity100 was ' an idiot and a puppet ' and @entity245 's then - mayor @entity244 was a ' little despot ' who was ' desperate ' to hold on to his position of power			1
@entity248 with his late wife @entity249 , left , in 2008 and , right , with girlfriend @entity74 in 2011			0
