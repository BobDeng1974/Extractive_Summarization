the video appears to show a fleet of @entity2 carrying the notorious black flag of @entity4 as they drive in perfect unison through the streets of @entity8			1
men , women and children cheer and salute the pick - up trucks as they drive freely through what is believed to be the city of @entity15			1
the carefully produced propaganda video was uploaded by terrorist group @entity17 on february 5			1
the group declared city an ' @entity21 emirate ' in july 2014 before pledging allegiance to @entity4 just three months later			1
in november of that year , the @entity23 blacklisted it as a terrorist organisation			0
the group was widely blamed for the death of @entity29 ambassador @entity28 in @entity15 in 2012			1
and only this week , it was linked to the bloody executions of 21 @entity33 christians on a beach in @entity8			1
fears of an equally brutal execution were raised following the news that 35 more @entity33 may have been kidnapped by @entity38 in the country			2
the latest abduction is thought to be a direct response to @entity33 airstrikes on extremist locations in the @entity8 city of @entity45 , following the mass murder of their countrymen			1
procession : a fleet of cars parade freely through the @entity8 city of @entity15 , showing the level of control they exercise in the country ruled almost entirely by rebel forces power : the ominous show of discipline and wealth shows how the country has been overrun by extremism as efforts to suppress @entity66 focus on @entity67 and @entity68 support : the parade of @entity2 is welcomed by the locals in @entity15			1
the video was posted by terrorist group @entity17 - who pledged allegiance to @entity4 last october chilling : even young children salute the procession of cars as they pass undeterred through the streets of @entity15 spreading extremism : dr @entity80 told @entity81 : ' @entity8 is seen by @entity82 now as the place to go spread the @entity84 ' in plain sight : the slickly - edited video - in style with @entity4 's propaganda videos - ends with a group of masked men aggressively facing the camera as one man addresses the viewer the @entity93 - a branch of @entity17 - was responsible for the very first footage of a beheading to surface from the @entity82 country			1
in november 2014 , it released footage showing the murder of an @entity33 soldier who publicly supported his government 's forces led by general @entity102			2
masked men in camouflage cut @entity106 's neck with a knife before removing his head and placing it on his back			0
the group has been enforcing @entity111 by carrying out public beheadings and beatings in @entity8 since their formation in at least august 2014			1
power exorcised by radical groups like the @entity93 continued to grow until february this year when the @entity4 of @entity118 self - declared ' caliphate ' in @entity119 - where 21 @entity33 were believed to be beheaded recently			1
its fighters traveled to the district in 40 heavily armoured cars and ordered residents to follow @entity4 's leader @entity124			2
he has since appointed @entity126 as @entity8 's @entity127 - or leader - meaning control over the country 's fractured terror groups falls to him according to @entity131 - based analyst dr @entity80			2
he told @entity81 : ' @entity8 is seen by @entity82 now as the place to go spread the @entity84			2
unlike a few years ago , when everyone was leaving @entity8 to go to the @entity118 , you now have people going back			0
' because the idea of ' state ' is there and now with the executions , they will feel like there are enough numbers on the ground to fight			0
they know at the same time the @entity143 is slow at acting			0
' three years after the removal of colonel @entity147 as the country 's ruler , @entity8 's main cities have surrendered control to a melting pot of extremist groups			2
most of them - including @entity17 , @entity155 and the @entity93 - have pledged their allegiance to @entity4 who seek to use the country 's location to establish a foothold in @entity82			1
overrun : the majority of @entity8 's coastal cities have surrendered control to @entity4 and other rebel extremist groups created to oppose the @entity166 - led invasion which removed @entity147 from power support : a young girl cheers and waves at the dozens of cars driving in perfect unison through the @entity8 city of @entity15 as they carry the black flags of @entity4 @entity4 : most of @entity8 's fractured extremist groups - including @entity17 , @entity155 and the @entity93 - have pledged their allegiance to @entity66 terrorism : dr @entity80 said @entity8 who traveled to fight in @entity68 are returning to their home country , where there are ' enough numbers on the ground to fight ' total control : flags and signposts featuring the black flag of @entity4 litter the city of @entity15 the internationally recognised government and parliament have since fled to @entity191 , near the @entity33 border			1
@entity66 exploited the gaps between the democratically elected @entity8 government in @entity195 and the @entity197 - led @entity196 in the capital @entity199			0
their joint failure to stop the spread of @entity4 has allowed the extremist group to seize control in a number of coastal cities including @entity206 , @entity15 , @entity45 and @entity119 - where the @entity207 were executed on sunday			1
the caption alongside the five - minute documenting the murderous video read : ' the people of the cross , followers of the hostile @entity33 church			2
' before the killings , one of the militants stood with a knife in his hand and said : ' safety for you crusaders is something you can only wish for			0
' @entity33 warplanes struck islamic state targets in @entity8 on monday in swift retribution for the extremists ' beheading of a group of @entity207 hostages on a beach , shown in a grisly online video released hours earlier			1
executed : at least 35 more @entity33 are believed to have been kidnapped by jihadists in @entity8 , raises the chilling prospect of yet another mass execution like the one seen on sunday when the @entity4 released a horrific video showing the beheading of 21 @entity236 on a beach ( above ) retaliation : @entity33 blitzed @entity66 training camps , weapons stockpiles and fighters in two waves of air strikes following the gruesome murder of captured @entity33 workers in a video ( above ) released on sunday horror : blood is seen in the @entity247			1
in the video the jihadis say they now plan to ' conquer @entity250 ' murder : the @entity93 - a branch of @entity17 - was responsible for the very first footage of a beheading to surface from the @entity82 country			2
masked men in camouflage cut @entity106 's ( pictured ) neck with a knife before removing his head and placing it on his back			0
in a radio interview today , @entity33 's president said a un-backed coalition was @entity8 's best chance of ridding @entity8 of its many extremist groups			1
speaking to @entity268 's @entity267 , @entity266 said @entity33 airstrikes against @entity4 group positions in @entity8 on monday were in self - defense			1
he siad : ' we will not allow them to cut off the heads of our children			0
we have abandoned the @entity8 people as prisoners of the militias			0
' the militias have to give up their arms and must work in a civil context			0
we have to disarm and prevent arms from falling into the hands of extremists			0
' what happened [ beheading of @entity207 ] is a crime , a monstrous terrorist crime that our children have their throats cuts in @entity8 and not to react			2
it 's a kind of self - defense accepted by the international community			0
we will not allow them to cut off the heads of our children			0
' meanwhile @entity294 prime minister @entity293 says he does not regret his country 's efforts to rid @entity8 of @entity147 , despite growing unrest and the threat from terrorists			0
the prime minister said @entity294 would not abandon @entity8 as he maintained his decision to send @entity294 military forces to the north @entity82 country in 2011 was the ' right thing to do '			0
he said : ' @entity294 is giving @entity8 support through our aid budget			0
we did a major training project for the @entity8 security forces			0
we are doing work to try and bring together a national unity government in @entity8			0
' but of course what we face in @entity8 is a very difficult situation with far too many armed militias , without a proper government and with the growth of ungoverned space , and we 've had the appalling events of the last few days with the brutal , senseless murders of @entity207 on the beach , which i know has shocked the whole world			0
' i discussed it yesterday with the president of @entity33 and what the whole world needs to do is come together and work for a @entity8 that has a national unity government , obviously excluding terrorists , and that can start to build the institutions of a state			1
