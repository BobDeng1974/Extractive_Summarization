this huge seventeenth - century barn could be yours for an absolute bargain - as long as you do n't mind a bit of @entity5			2
the enormous structure , which is on the the market for only £ 100,000 , has been dubbed the ultimate flat - pack challenge for any @entity10 fan			2
made from dozens of solid oak beams , it will be delivered to the buyer completely dismantled			1
but do n't worry if you 're not handy with a hammer - there 's no sign of an @entity19 key , picture instructions or a @entity22 meatball in sight			0
instead , each piece of timber has been numbered and an expert in historic buildings will be on hand to help rebuild it			1
there , it stood for 350 years on a country estate until the owners decided they no longer wanted it			1
under threat of being sold off in individual chunks , the barn was salvaged by @entity57 , an expert in preserving historic barns , in the early 1990s			0
it was dismantled and sold to a brewery 25 years ago who planned to turn it into a unique venue for functions but a suitable location for it was never found			1
it has been in storage ever since until it was recently listed for sale again following a change of heart by the brewery			0
it has now gone on sale at @entity74 auction house at @entity75 , @entity76 , with an auction to take place on october 22			1
and although the barn is currently in pieces , it can easily be reassembled into a structure that is 121ft long , 28ft wide and 25ft tall by a team of experts			2
but despite a pre-sale estimate of £ 100,000 , it will cost another £ 100,000 to put it back together and transform it into a grand house , office or function hall			1
left , the historic barn before it was dismantled 25 years ago to be sold to a brewery and right , what the timber looks like in storage mr @entity57 , from @entity98 , @entity76 , said : ' the barn dates back to the mid- 17th century when it would have been used as a tithe barn to store lots of different things in			1
' it was dismantled about 25 years ago on a big farm estate where it was getting in the way of modern farm buildings being built			1
' it was going to be sold off as individual timbers so we bought the whole lot , numbered it up , dismantled it and found a new home for it with a brewery			0
' it was intended to remain as an open plan building that would be used for functions but the brewery never got round to finding the right site for it			0
' in the end they asked us to buy it back from them , which we did			0
the barn first stood at @entity44 , a grand country estate near @entity45 in @entity46			1
it was a thatched thithe barn before it was converted into a house			0
after 350 years , under threat of being sold off in parts , it was salvaged by @entity132 , an expert in preserving historic barns , in the early 1990s			2
it was bought by a brewery 25 years ago to turn into a venue for functions but a location was never found			2
it has now come out of storage and gone on sale at @entity74 auction house in @entity75 , @entity76			1
' the barn is made up of many tonnes of beams that we have been storing			2
' it 's like the ultimate @entity10 flatpack , which is exactly how things were made back then			0
' the only differences are that we will deliver it to the buyer and they wo n't need an @entity19 key to put it up - we will help re-erect it too			0
' the barn is hugely historic - very few buildings last as long as its been around , and it will easily last another 500 years			2
' the framework is hand hewn from oak and it is held together entirely with mortise and tenon oak pegs and it 's in amazing condition			0
' i can confidently say there will never be another barn like this come up for sale			0
' we are expecting offers over £ 100,000 and it would probably cost the same again to erect and turn into a house			1
' that 's cheaper than buying a terraced house in some parts of the country			0
' we think it would make an ideal wedding venue - there 's a real demand for unique wedding venues and we think this building would be wonderful for just that			0
' it is an exceptional building , a unique situation and an absolute bargain			0
' the auction guide shows the barn before it was dismantled but it will cost the buyer another £ 100,000 to put back together a plan of the barn showing the roof			1
it will be auctioned at @entity74 auction house at @entity75 , @entity76 , on october 22 a team of experts in historical building can easily reassemble it into a structure that is 121ft long , 28ft wide and 25ft tall it was listed for sale after the brewery , which bought it 25 years ago to turn into a venue for functions , failed to find a location for it for 350 years , the barn stood on a grand country estate , first as a thatched thithe barn but it was later converted into a house the ultimate challenge for @entity10 lovers ? but do n't worry , there 's not an @entity19 key , instructions or @entity22 meatball in sight			1
