take the @entity1 winner @entity0 , add the most talented @entity3 player of his generation in @entity5 , throw in the top scorer from the last @entity7 , @entity8 , and the goalkeeper who made the most saves last season in @entity11 in @entity12 , add the world football 's most affable manager @entity13 and what have you got ? possibly the £ 530million super team that will dominate @entity19 football for the next five years			1
@entity21 's transformation into the team everyone wants to watch has even got @entity25 twitching			1
speaking in @entity30 this week the former @entity27 player and @entity29 - winning manager gave his verdict on @entity21 's summer signings and it made depressing reading for the rest of @entity35			1
' he moves the ball about very well and @entity8 is a really top - class ball - player			0
@entity21 have so much quality in midfield and up - front			0
@entity27 used to sign the ball - players , now it 's @entity21			1
' the praise from @entity25 and the sight of the ball a blur in the ' rondo ' passing drills at @entity21 's @entity74 training ground – something that was once @entity27 's trademark – is a reminder that @entity21 went to another level last season and are threatening to go to yet another level this season			1
@entity80 had made them the best counter-attacking team in world football and @entity13 has maintained that element to their play with the £ 86million introduction of @entity5 last season making them even more lethal on the counter-attack			0
but with the introduction of @entity91 last season and the growing influence of @entity93 , a short passing game was added to the cut - throat forays forward			1
@entity21 could mix it up			0
now with @entity8 and @entity43 they can really mix it up			0
rival : @entity27 legend @entity25 has commented positively on @entity21 's recruitment and playing style sharp shooter : @entity5 practises free kicks watched by @entity21 coach @entity13 star appeal : @entity21 's @entity5 ( left ) , @entity104 ( centre ) and @entity8 train in @entity48 on the run : @entity43 ( left ) and @entity5 train with their team - mates at @entity109 on monday stopper : @entity21 signed @entity12 this summer and the average age of their starting line - up is just 25 @entity113 aware of expectation the upshot is that sides facing the @entity19 champions are at a loss as to how to play them			1
play a high line and the ball over the top to @entity0 and @entity5 destroys them as @entity59 found out last season			0
let them have the ball and play in front of you and with @entity93 now supported by @entity8 and @entity43 they can play passes through the gaps			2
and they can also shoot from distance , which gives them something even the brilliant @entity27 team that won 14 trophies in four years under @entity138 did not have			2
there were times when that @entity27 side floundered against a 10 - man defence and would rely on a long shot for the breakthrough			2
occasionally it came , from @entity146 at @entity147 in 2009 , but often it did n't			0
this @entity21 side scored more goals from outside the area than any team in @entity30 last season and with @entity43 and @entity8 added that is not about to change			1
it 's not the first time @entity21 have tried to buy every world - class player on the planet but the last time it ended in tears as egos clashed and players were brought in with no thought given to how they might play together			2
local hero : @entity21 's @entity163 forward @entity5 at @entity109 on monday ahead of the @entity47 waiting in the wings : real legend @entity165 is likely to take over from @entity13 in the future next in line : @entity168 is likely to be named the next permanent @entity21 captain if @entity170 leaves sir @entity171 dubbed that crop the @entity173 because there was more exhibition than silverware			1
if last year 's @entity30 and @entity29 double are any indication there is a winning mentality to this team that will not be satisfied by thrilling failure			1
winning all six trophies this season is the aim and they can also become the first side to win back - to - back champions @entity187			2
the frightening thing for their rivals is that the age of the players likely to line - up for the big games this season ( @entity197 27 , @entity198 22 , @entity199 21 , @entity168 28 , @entity200 26 , @entity43 24 , @entity8 23 , @entity93 28 , @entity5 25 , @entity201 26 , @entity0 29 ) is just 25			2
and when @entity13 does decide to step aside @entity165 will be ready to step - up from the b - team			0
click here to start picking your fantasy football team now ! there ’s £ 60,000 in prizes including £ 1,000 up for grabs every week … it 's a dynasty in the making , and one that has got the marketing men salivating too			0
there is something for everyone with @entity216 @entity168 likely to emerge as the long - term captain if @entity170 is eventually replaced by @entity12 ; @entity222 superstar @entity8 world football 's next poster - boy , @entity0 the @entity1 - crowned king of world football and @entity7 winner @entity43 , the @entity218 who walked out on @entity59 to be part of it all			0
in any language ( but we 'll use @entity30 ) it 's an ' equipazo ' , a brilliant team			0
and on tuesday night in @entity48 , with homeboy @entity5 leading the way , it goes in search of trophy no 1 of a possible six this season			0
titles : @entity21 can win a maximum of six trophies this season - and they are aiming to claim all of them @entity239 and @entity0 showboat in training			1

@entity21 now boast a team of superstars who *complement* each other
@entity27 legend @entity25 is *worried* by @entity21 's recruitment and style
they have a side who can mix it up and play in all sorts of ways
@entity93 and @entity8 allow @entity21 to play a crisp , passing game
@entity21 scored most goals from outside the *box* in @entity30 league last season
@entity21 can win six trophies this season - and they aim to claim them all
they also want to become the first team to defend the @entity29
@entity21 face @entity46 in @entity267 in @entity48 on tuesday evening
