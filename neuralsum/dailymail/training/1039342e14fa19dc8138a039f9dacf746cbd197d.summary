but yesterday , @entity2 – one of the country ’s leading and most outspoken businesswomen - left the firm with immediate effect after just two years in the job			1
the sudden departure of the colourful 52 - year - old stunned the @entity21 , wiping £ 360 million off the company ’s value as its share price plunged			0

well - known in the @entity21 for her voracious work ethic , gruelling 5am fitness regimes and for needing less sleep than @entity39 , the glamorous high flyer has been replaced by @entity40 , a 13 year @entity41 veteran of the firm			2
mystery surrounds why the board was in such a hurry to get rid of its star chief executive , who is thought to have wanted another 12 months at the helm to knock the business into shape			1
in a statement issued to the stockmarket ms @entity2 – who has not lined up another job - indicated the timing of her departure was of her own choosing and said her ‘ work is complete ’			1
she said : ‘ i have always said that i would move on to another company with fresh challenges once my work was complete			0
’ but speaking at trade publication @entity66 ’s @entity65 conference last thursday , ms @entity2 told a very different story			1
she said the turnaround at @entity1 was far from complete and described it as a six year job			1
‘ there are many things that are n’t done , ’ she said			0
‘ you ca n’t do a transformation on this sort of scale in a year or two years			2
i usually say it ’s about six years …			2
. we go to the city next week with our second set of results , to show if and how the company has become fitter and better , and we ’re absolutely not done			0
’ although the chairman insisted the decision was ‘ amicable ’ and ‘ unanimous ’ , it appears to have backfired as shares fell by almost 18pc yesterday			2
it is thought that the board may have become frustrated with the ' cult of personality ' that outspoken ms @entity2 has cultivated during her time at the company this was also driven by a warning from the company that ‘ tougher market conditions ’ – particularly growing problems in the eurozone – would cause its business to grow more slowly next year			1
chairman @entity99 rejected reports that ms @entity2 had been pushed out			1

miss @entity2 has become a darling of the @entity21 and a role model for women in business after leading a dramatic revival of @entity1 , which is used by 6.5million @entity8 holidaymakers a year and traces its history back to 1841			1
her success has also gained the attention of the prime minister , with @entity119 appointing her to his inner circle of top business advisers			2
as one of the few female bosses of big companies , ms @entity2 was voted @entity126 businesswoman of the year in may			1
her departure means there are just twelve women running @entity130 and @entity132 firms			0
standing just 5 foot 3 tall , ms @entity2 has shown a ruthless streak , cutting costs and adapting the business to cater for the surge in people booking their holidays online , rather than by visiting a travel agent			1
@entity1 still specialises in all inclusive package holidays , but ms @entity2 has sought to take the business upmarket			1
the strategy has been painful , with the firm cutting 2,500 jobs and closing more than 300 high street stores in a bid to cut costs and modernise			2
but it has also been successful			0

ms @entity2 is pictured with her husband @entity156 at an awards ceremony earlier this year for more from the @entity158 click here			1
despite having no experience in the travel industry she famously cold called the chairman of the struggling tour operator @entity99 , telling him she was the right person to turn the business around			2
at the time it was on its knees , suffering from a general fall in tourism numbers as a result of the global recession and unrest in the @entity173 hitting package holidays in @entity175 and @entity176			0
miss @entity2 is equally focussed about her love life – she claims to have taken just seven seconds to choose her businessman husband @entity178 when she met him in @entity179			1
she has two step children from her husband ’s first marriage , but says she does not see her family from monday to thursday			0

a self professed lover of designer labels and diamonds , ms @entity2 is also a fitness fanatic and enjoys early 5.30am gym sessions with her former marine and war veteran personal trainer			1
she is a devotee of @entity200 and claims to need just four hours sleep a night , declaring the death of her father when she was just 14 persuaded her to make the most of every day			0
' sleep is overrated ' : the life of @entity2 @entity2 has previously boasted of getting just three and a half hours of sleep a night , and hits the gym for an hour a day with an ex-marine at the end of 2011 , @entity1 was a company at its lowest ebb			1
falling tourism numbers had seen nearly three quarters of the firm 's value disappear in just 12 months , while it had just been named as @entity8 's @entity217			2
in november the board had to go to banks , begging bowl in hand , to ask for £ 200million to prop itself up			0
it was around that time that chairman @entity99 got a cold - call from @entity2			1
never one to doubt her own abilities , ms @entity2 told him simply that she was the person to turn @entity1 's ailing fortunes around			1
the following summer , she was appointed as ceo			2
that direct , no - nonsense pitch was typical of ms @entity2 's style			1
under her leadership , the firm has cut 2,500 staff , closed 300 stores , but managed to add £ 2billion to its value			2
despite standing at just 5ft 3in tall , ms @entity2 has managed to carve out a career in the boisterous , testosterone - driven world of the modern global ceo			1
she once quipped that ' sleep is overrated ' and reportedly gets just three and a half hours of shut - eye each night , less than former prime minister @entity39			0
her daily routine sees her up at 3.3am each morning to answer emails from staff of all ranks as part of her ask @entity245 hour			0
she told @entity66 : ' i reply to every email within 24 hours and usually a lot faster			0
' when people realised that , it sent the most symbolic ripple through the organisation			0
" she replies to us , and quickly , so we 've got to keep moving ! " by 5am she is usually in the gym , pushing herself through a gruelling routine alongside her personal trainer - a @entity258 who served in @entity260			0
business may keep her occupied for the remainder of the day , but she still finds time to be a prolific tweeter and an avid reader , picking up everything from @entity266 to @entity267			0
born in 1961 in @entity268 , @entity269 , ms @entity2 is the eldest of three children and attended state school @entity271			1
she was a fan of amateur dramatics and history at school , but the defining moment of her younger years came when her father died of a brain tumour when she was just 14			0
she says the trauma taught her that 's * * * happens ' and was determined to make the most of every moment from then on			0
she went on to @entity281 , @entity187 , where she graduated with a @entity282 in @entity283 in 1983 , and studied at the @entity284			0
she began her career working for a magazine , @entity286 , before making the move into business herself			0
since then ms @entity2 has lived and worked on four continents and even learnt @entity290 for one job , giving a speech to 2,000 people in @entity294 using her new language			2
while there she also began practicing yoga , and at one time had a miniature @entity300 garden arranged on her desk			0
but a touchy - feely new - ager she is not			0
outspoken in her opinions , she has branded a year of maternity leave as ' too long ' and rubbished the idea of quotas to attract more women to the boardroom			0
it is perhaps that attitude that saw her depart from @entity1 yesterday , a year ahead of schedule			2
but it is an attitude she is unlikely to change any time soon .			0

@entity2 has left @entity1 as ceo calling the decision ' *mutual* '
it had been thought that she would spent at least three years at the firm
she recently said that turning the business around would take six years
@entity323 *believed* to have been frustrated with ' cult of personality ' around her
