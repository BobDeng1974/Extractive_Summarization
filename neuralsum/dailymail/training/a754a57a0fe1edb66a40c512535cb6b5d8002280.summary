you would probably win a couple of pints in a pub trivia bet if you asked : ‘ who is @entity5 ? ’ and ‘ which current @entity7 team scored their fewest points in 20 years last season ? ’ and it ’s a value - for - money poser because the answers centre on just one club : @entity13			1
their ‘ season horribilis ’ in 2013/14 included : sacking @entity14 in march and replacing him with reserve - team manager @entity15 , failing to get out of their @entity7 group , losing a five - and - a - half - year unbeaten home record , recording their lowest total since three points for a win was introduced and ending up 13 behind title - winners and hated rivals @entity23 , who also knocked them out of both domestic cups at the semi-final stage			2
@entity5 's @entity13 have got off to a fine start to the season by winning three of their four league games @entity5 succeeded caretaker manager @entity15 after @entity14 resigned from the post @entity35 made a name for himself at @entity13 before moving across @entity37 to @entity38 in 2004 @entity5 , now in charge at the @entity40 , was a journeyman footballer — one appearance for @entity42 , one for the @entity44 national team and a handful of horrible memories at @entity47			1
in the mid- 1990s , if you ’d tried to sell lucky white heather to the current @entity13 boss he ’d either have punched your lights out , or bitten your hand off			1
he played nine times in a strong @entity47 era , winning just once			2
worse , he was in goal for the 1994 supercup final second - leg 5 - 4 defeat to @entity57 in front of 70,000 dismayed @entity59 at the @entity60 and was sent off			2
two years later , he was between the sticks for sir @entity62 ’s @entity47 when they lost the supercup final second - leg 3 - 1 to @entity64			2
the low point came in the home leg of a @entity68 last - 16 tie against @entity64 when he was sent off at the @entity60 after 13 minutes			0
@entity47 lost 4 - 1 and @entity5 cried on the way to the dressing room			1
he had some days of wine and roses , happy times with @entity74 and selection for @entity78 ’s 1994 @entity77 squad , plus @entity37 football for @entity80			0
@entity5 played in goal for sir @entity62 's @entity47 during his playing days as a goalkeeper but , as with @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity35 , neither a lack of playing experience nor a moderate career was a barrier to significant coaching success			1
already @entity5 has coached some of @entity78 ’s continuing golden generation to win the @entity93 @entity92 at both under - 21 and under - 19 level			1
now he ’s the boss of the 2004 @entity7 and 2011 @entity96 winners			0
ahead of sunday 's @entity98 derby against @entity99 , @entity13 sit joint - top of the @entity102 league and lead @entity103 after their 6 - 0 hammering of @entity105			1
more intriguingly , the 48 - year - old @entity106 is working with the youngest average - aged squad in @entity7 history ( just over 22 - years - old ) and needs to accommodate the signing of 14 new players over the summer — seven of whom are @entity44			0
with his technical staff , it means that at this proud @entity102 club there are now 12 @entity44 driving its progress			1
if results go awry , no question who will be first to be blamed			0
‘ football is universal ! i ’ll ensure that there are no “ nationalities ” here — just good , well - taught , committed footballers all treated the same , ’ @entity5 says			1
the midweek win indicates he has a gem in @entity129 , who scored a glorious hat - trick in his first ever @entity7 match , having been signed from @entity132			0
the @entity134 - @entity133 is a player to make your ticket price seem like good value			0
but there are more sparklers			0
@entity13 forward @entity129 , pictured celebrating his goal against @entity105 , is one to watch @entity142 is a 17 - year - old @entity102 star in the making			1
as is 19 - year - old @entity106 @entity144 , on loan from @entity64 since @entity5 was his coach with the @entity78 youth teams			1
right now , nothing is more imperative than establishing city dominance			0
@entity99 have struggled this season but theirs is an upwards trajectory , having been down in the third tier because of financial problems			1
back at the top table , @entity13 want to make clear who is master and who is servant			2
there is a treat in store for the @entity44 coach			0
born in the @entity162 , his @entity7 group games will take him back to the new @entity163 to play @entity164			0
‘ ( manager ) @entity166 ’s work absolutely stands out there , ’ says @entity5			2
‘ they deserved to qualify for this competition and going “ home ” to play that marvellous team in their new stadium , in front of truly great fans , is a treat			0
’ no need for lucky white heather now .			0

@entity13 have won three of their first four league matches
the @entity102 *giants* face @entity99 at the @entity183 do @entity184 on sunday
@entity5 will be *hoping* he mimic @entity35 's success at @entity13
