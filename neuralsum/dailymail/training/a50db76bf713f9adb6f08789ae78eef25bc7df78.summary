@entity0 , pictured above , used a @entity2 policeman as the inspiration behind her famous detective @entity4 it is a mystery almost as great as those that he solves			1
it seems the inspiration behind @entity11 may have been unveiled as a policeman from @entity2			0
little - known gendarme @entity13 is the man who the author turned into her famous detective @entity4 , according to the descendant of a wartime fundraiser			1
@entity0 introduced the sleuth in her 1920 novel , @entity18 , and he went on to ' exercise his little grey cells ' in 33 novels			1
although the author never revealed any particular person as her inspiration an amateur researcher says he has now uncovered evidence @entity26 could have been the real - life @entity4			0
new details have emerged of a meeting between a young @entity13 and @entity0 - when she played the piano for him in her home town of @entity33			1
@entity13 fled his country in the face of advancing @entity37 troops in 1914 , and made his way to @entity39 - just as the fictional character did			1
the 57 - year - old and his son @entity41 , 17 , travelled to @entity43 , @entity44 , to meet local volunteer called @entity46 , who logs their names in her diary			0
mrs @entity46 , a married mother - of - four , helped around 500 @entity2 find places to stay during the @entity51 and was later honoured by its government			0
she was also involved in wartime fundraising events , hosting one at the home of a friend , a @entity57 , who was putting up @entity13 and his son at her house in @entity33			1
newspaper records reveal that locals laid on entertainment on january 6 , 1915 , with 24 - year - old @entity0 playing the piano for the @entity2 guests			1
@entity0 later claimed she ' found ' the characters for @entity18 while travelling around @entity33			1
@entity67 ’s grandson @entity66 was researching his relative ’s exploits with the help of the @entity71 when he uncovered the chance meeting between @entity13 and @entity0			1
' @entity13 ' - now revealed as @entity73 - fled his country in the face of advancing @entity37 troops in 1914 , and made his way to @entity39 , just as the fictional character did			2
the 57 - year - old and his son @entity41 , 17 , travelled to @entity43 , @entity44 , to meet local volunteer called @entity46 , who logged their names in her diary mr @entity81 , a retired navy captain , said : ' @entity82 kept a black notebook listing some 500 @entity2 refugees of all classes who passed through @entity43			0
' the first lot included this retired gendarme , @entity13 , and his son			2
the names of many of the families who received them are recorded			0
' he eventually went to stay with a mrs @entity92 who lived in a house called the @entity94 in @entity33			2
' it ’s been knocked down now and there ’s a housing estate in its place			0
@entity0 introduced the sleuth in her 1920 novel , @entity18 , and he went on to ' exercise his little grey cells ' in 33 novels according to her official website , @entity0 never revealed who inspired the character which in turn became a tv hit - but ' during the @entity51 there were @entity2 refugees in most parts of the @entity39 countryside , @entity33 being no exception ' ' but the @entity33 museum has confirmed however that the @entity114 held a meeting in their house to raise money and gather clothing for the refugees			1
' a young girl played the piano at the event			1
this young lady later became the crime writer @entity0 - so there is a very strong circumstantial link to @entity4			1
' mrs @entity46 , who was married to @entity81 , a solicitor and sheriff of @entity43 , died in the 1920s just as @entity0 ’s writing career was taking off			2
for her services to the refugees mrs @entity46 was awarded a @entity2 medal , la @entity134 , which the family still have			0
mrs @entity46 , a married mother - of - four , helped around 500 @entity2 find places to stay during the @entity51 and was later honoured by its government the youngest of the refugees are said to have nicknamed her @entity141 , pronounced @entity142 , which is @entity144 for @entity145			0
mr @entity81 said his grandmother has personally gone to the train station to meet all 500 , including @entity13 and his son @entity41 , in person			2
@entity13 would have been a similar age to his fictional counterpart , although little else is known about him and there is no mention of whether he had a moustache like @entity4			2
mr @entity81 said : ' all of us now think of @entity4 as rather a fat chap waddling along with a distinct character but that does n’t mean to say he was like that in real life			0
'' all we know about @entity13 is that he was gendarme and he had a son			2
he was married but he did n’t bring along his wife his wife at the time			0
' it ’s seems quite plausible that @entity0 met him at the event and may have been intrigued by his stories			2
' we do n’t know any of this for sure , but then its seems quite fitting that the real life @entity4 should remains as mysterious as the books themselves			0
' according to her official website , @entity0 never revealed who inspired the character - but ' during the @entity51 there were @entity2 refugees in most parts of the @entity39 countryside , @entity33 being no exception '			1
@entity183 , publisher for the @entity184 , said : ' @entity0 always claimed she was inspired by the @entity2 refugees she met			1
' it ’s quite plausible that she played the piano for them at a social event as she was quite an accomplished pianist			0
' as far as i ’m aware she never said that @entity4 was based on any one person , he ’s very much a composite character			0
' so whether this event was one of those occasions when she thought about him , i do n’t know - but it certainly makes for a great little story			0

it *'s* claimed @entity13 is man who author turned into famous detective
details have emerged of meeting between young @entity13 and @entity0
it is said that she played the piano for him in her home town of @entity33
