that was an outstanding win and a perfect way to start a huge year			2
to make light of their injuries , to come to @entity6 on a friday night and stay so cool and composed when they went 10 - 0 down was exceptional			1
it was one of the very best performances of the @entity12 era			0
i really enjoyed the contribution of the young @entity16 trio behind the scrum with @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 all stepping up			1
this was a big night for them and they all delivered			0
@entity0 players celebrate at the full - time whistle after a brilliant 21 - 16 win against @entity6 on friday night @entity0 wing @entity18 ( left ) had a stellar game during their @entity30 curtain - raiser in @entity31 @entity18 ( left ) scored his first - ever try for his country with a first half touchdown at the @entity34 the 20 - year - old is mobbed by his @entity0 team - mates after scoring against @entity6 at the @entity34 @entity37 noted the potential of @entity18 in 2013 it was a huge second - half performance generally by @entity0 as they took the game by the scruff of the neck and bossed it in exactly the way you would hope from a team with genuine @entity47 hopes			1
the physicality was excellent but very controlled and disciplined and @entity49 overcame a nervous start – his missed tackle contributed to @entity6 ’ first try – to produce probably his best @entity0 display			1
he was aggressive and relentless and took the battle to @entity6 in the way he does every week for @entity54			1
all the @entity0 pack went well – i expected nothing less despite injuries in the second row – and although i was worried for a few minutes when @entity12 started emptying the bench when @entity0 were picking up momentum , everybody came through			1
@entity63 was tackling like a man possessed at the end there			0
behind the scrum again just about everybody put their hand up with the @entity16 trio looking hungry and happy to take centre stage			1
there was an excitement and vitality to the @entity0 performance , not to mention a couple of very classy moments which really excited me going forward because this was a high - pressure match			1
i ca n’t remember a bigger start to the @entity30 tournament and it was a real taster for the @entity47 where every match will feel this big and important			2
the atmosphere was fantastic , inspiring , but we always knew it would be – roof open or not			0
wales got off to a bright start when scrum - half @entity88 ( left ) ran in to score the game 's first try the in - form 26 - year - old ( centre ) celebrates his try with @entity6 captain @entity95 ( right ) on friday night how the @entity30 table looks after friday 's result friday night was all about doing the right thing at the right time and doing it exceptionally well			1
and for the most part , it was a red - letter day for @entity0 test rugby is about world - class play under intense pressure , getting it right when it counts most			1
we saw that with the first - half tries – @entity88 for @entity6 and @entity18 for @entity0			1
it was my old favourite @entity109 – @entity112			2
for the @entity6 try , @entity0 had seemingly rescued the situation with a powerful scrum on the @entity116 put - in that sent the @entity6 pack travelling back at a rate of knots but @entity120 had the presence of mind to reach in and rescue the ball			1
in fact you could even argue that was handling in the scrum , he almost plucked it in the front row as the scrum disintegrated			0
but @entity120 showed great athleticism and skill			0
he attacked from a standing start , exploded out of the blocks , handed off the defence and released @entity88 perfectly			0
@entity49 , making his one mistake of the night , hesitated just for a second , went too high and got shrugged off			0
that ’s all it takes at this level			0
and then again with @entity0 ’s first try			2
@entity0 ’s scrum had won a penalty and set up the field positon when @entity147 ’s pass went awry which often unsettles a defence			1
@entity149 reacted superbly and put the ball on to his natural left foot to thread the grubber through			0
it was just about the only good option available and he took it			0
@entity18 read the play very well and showed real try - scoring instincts in getting the touchdown under pressure			1
that was world class at a time when @entity0 had to score next			2
@entity6 fullback @entity164 punished @entity0 's ill - discipline by kicking some first half penalties @entity0 fly - half @entity20 controlled proceedings well as the visitors ' dominated the second half @entity18 was right at home – taking high ball , coming off his wing , working well with @entity149			1
he was unlucky in the first half when he timed his ‘ take ’ perfectly so as not to take the ball into his 22 yet when @entity149 cleared 60 yards downfield he was brought back			0
that decision - making ability under pressure is key in defence and it was making the wrong decisions that cost @entity0 those two early penalties which is something they can and must work on			1
wide out in the tramlines near the halfway line there was no reason for @entity186 to prevent release while @entity188 was caught handling in a ruck needlessly 45 metres out			0
you just do n’t do that when the opposition have a @entity164 in their team			0
there was no danger in either situation for penalty but the mistakes resulted in @entity0 coughing up six points			2
come the second half , we saw ice in the veins when @entity19 took his try so well			2
there was just a half - chance there and although the @entity6 defence was n’t the best the @entity16 centre did very well with his step and swivel			1
and at the death @entity212 absolutely buried that long penalty – it could have been @entity215 slotting the ball over			0
taking about pressure , that was definitely what caused the stand - off in the tunnel before the game			2
these unscripted things happen in sport			0
they are not choreographed ; they just come from the dynamic tensions of the moment			0
it happened with us in @entity231 in 2005 when @entity232 stood his ground and declined to move across to the other side of the halfway line for the anthems			0
it ’s all part of the game , it ’s all good fun but @entity147 was n’t going to move until he got an assurance that @entity6 would be following soon behind and i quite like that			2
@entity0 centre @entity19 scored the decisive try of the game with a fantastic second half effort @entity19 ( centre ) is mobbed by his @entity0 team - mates as they celebrate his try during friday 's encounter			1

@entity0 won 21 - 16 against @entity6 in friday night 's @entity30 opener
@entity0 wing @entity18 scored his first *international* try in *victory*
20 - year - old played brilliantly with @entity109 - thinking clearly under pressure
@entity18 's @entity16 team - mate @entity19 scored @entity0 's second try
