by @entity0 given it ’s only 18 months since @entity3 declared unequivocally to this newspaper he felt ‘ more @entity5 than @entity6 , ’ there are passionate supporters of @entity10 ’s @entity9 team who could be forgiven for feeling a bit like @entity12 this morning			1
if truth be told , this latest u-turn from the 25 - year - old is a bit less shocking than that one at @entity17 last month detailing his split with fiancee @entity12			0
everything changed for @entity3 in the aftermath of our story about his feelings of ‘ @entity25 ’			2
it caused such a commotion i sought him out the following week to make sure he had no problems with the piece			0
sifting through the furore , @entity3 made it clear he was not bothered about the nutters filling the airwaves and newspaper columns with screeds of bigotry			2
what did cause angst — and make him think — were the thousands of decent @entity6 people who were genuinely hurt that someone who had grown up playing for @entity6 could now contemplate deserting them on the biggest team stage of all			1
going green : @entity3 has chosen to play for @entity6 instead of @entity49 at the 2016 @entity9 patriot games : @entity3 in action at the @entity53 event ahead of the @entity54 at @entity55 resort @entity57 - round 1 highlights since then , @entity3 has tried to make amends			1
he has committed early to the @entity54 each year			0
when he missed the halfway cut last year , he stayed around , signing autographs and chatting with the locals			0
now comes the most spectacular act of atonement of all			0
it could certainly be argued that playing for @entity6 represents the path of least resistance			2
if he had represented @entity10 in @entity72 , for instance , his reputation would never have recovered in the @entity73			2
no doubt there are plenty on one side of the divide in @entity77 who will be feeling sore			2
but most people in @entity49 , including me , will echo the thoughts of @entity10 ’s golf coach @entity82 in recognising the difficult position @entity3 was in , respect his decision and wish him well for @entity72			1
best wishes : @entity10 coach @entity82 has respected @entity3 's decision to play for @entity87 as @entity82 says , the worst of all worlds would have been if @entity3 had elected to sit on the @entity91 @entity90 , who will also play for @entity6 , put forward a persuasive explanation as to why they should wear green			1
‘ if you want to get religious or political about it you ’re going to upset people but , to me , golf is an all - @entity77 sport , ’ he said			2
‘ i grew up wanting to wear the green blazer with a shamrock on it , so it makes sense that the best players , whether they be from north or south of the border , should want to represent @entity6 in the @entity9			1
’ @entity3 certainly picked a great time to announce it , with the @entity54 about to begin and some sporting event going on in @entity72 you might have heard about			0
it must be a huge relief as well , for the longer it went on without a decision , the more the speculation would have grown			0
@entity112 style : @entity113 has put forward a persuasive argument for wanting to represent @entity77 for the @entity6 , of course , it ’s a massive coup			1
trying to predict the golfing landscape is difficult enough next month , let alone in two years , but it will be surprising if @entity3 is not favourite to claim the gold medal when the sport re-enters the @entity9 fold for the first time since 1904			1
he will be , by a considerable distance , the most feted sportsman in the @entity6 team and will be invited to carry the flag into the stadium at the opening ceremony			1
the format will be a 72 - hole event featuring 60 players with qualification based on world ranking			0
two players will represent each nation but up to four are allowed if they are all in the world ’s top 15			0
two men who might greet this turn of events with a rueful smile are @entity141 @entity140 and @entity142			0
unless they overtake the two @entity143 in the world ranking or climb into the top 15 , they will miss the party			0
brit of alright : based on current rankings , @entity10 would feature @entity149 ( @entity150 ) and @entity151 ( r ) conversely , @entity5 players such as @entity151 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 now have a better chance of qualifying for the @entity9			1
based on the present world rankings , @entity10 would have been @entity3 and @entity149			1
now it would be @entity160 and @entity151 , with the aforementioned quartet in hot pursuit of a place			0
clearly they will not be too upset to learn @entity3 is now more @entity6 than @entity5			1
@entity165 hitting shots & @entity3 lost clubs			0

@entity3 has chosen to play for @entity6 instead of @entity49 at the 2016 @entity9
golfer did not want to *disappoint* fans from his *homeland* of @entity77
the decision has been backed by @entity10 coach @entity82
@entity90 gave a persuasive argument to play for @entity6
at present , @entity10 's team would feature @entity149 and @entity151
