as enthusiasts patiently explain , motor racing is a team sport			0
we think it ’s all about the best driver , true aficionados see beyond to unsung heroes in overalls glimpsed during pit stops and others who sit at drawing boards and laptop computers			0
the most committed @entity15 fans are never outraged by team orders and regard the constructors ’ championship as equally compelling			1
so why the fuss about @entity20 ? if the rules state that a designer must be limited or regulated if he gets too good , what is the point in having a constructors ’ championship at all ? @entity20 driver @entity27 celebrates his win at the season - opening race in @entity30 , @entity31 @entity27 and @entity20 team - mate @entity32 were in a class of their own as they dominated the race @entity27 , the reigning world champion , is the overwhelming favourite to defend his @entity15 crown give everyone the same car , forget teams and make @entity15 about drivers only			1
the problem is , who would then pay for all that expensive equipment to be ferried around the world ? one can hardly imagine @entity27 trundling his wheels off a ferry at @entity51 before making his way down to the @entity54 @entity53 via the toll roads			2
yes , we may be in for a boring @entity15 season but not for the reason many imagine : the dominance of @entity20			1
this is shaping up as a dull one because the narrative is now set at one team being too good and @entity27 being the best only because he has the fastest car			1
critics then seek to devalue his achievements			0
naturally , the man with the fastest machine often wins — but not always			0
in the past 30 years , there have been four occasions when the top driver was n’t in the top car and @entity27 is the only one to achieve that feat this century			2
@entity74 driver @entity73 finished sixth at the first race of the season , one lap down on @entity27 @entity78 oversaw @entity80 dominance from 2010 - 2013 as they won four consecutive championships @entity83 , motorsport advisor of @entity74 , has speculated that his team could pull out of @entity15 video @entity74 threaten exit over ' boring ' rules in 2008 , @entity27 won the drivers ’ championship in a @entity90 but @entity91 took the constructors ’ title			1
before that , @entity94 ( 1999 ) , @entity95 ( 1994 ) and @entity96 ( 1986 ) also pulled it off			0
so when @entity27 said if everyone had the same car he would still be champion , he is probably right			2
@entity15 is n’t like that , though			0
it ’s a team game , and @entity20 deserve their glory , too			2
@entity83 , motorsport advisor of @entity74 , has speculated that his team could pull out if @entity20 are allowed to dominate and some are troubled by that threat — but what if @entity20 walked instead ? what if , instead of losing the also - rans , the team with the best driver and the best car grew sick of the artificial manipulation , and withdrew ? @entity74 dominated for four years and each season changes were made to try to rein them in , but after one race ? that is a pathetic attitude			1
‘ just get your head down , work hard and try to sort it out , ’ was the advice from @entity20 chief @entity118 and he is right			1
if this season is about @entity27 versus his team - mate @entity32 , tough			1
last year , @entity15 risked a lottery by awarding random double points for the final @entity53			0
this is worse — a sport that seeks to put the brakes on excellence for the sake of mediocrity is not much of a sport at all .			0

@entity27 won in @entity31 ahead of team - mate @entity134
@entity83 , motorsport advisor of @entity74 , has speculated that his team could pull out of @entity15 if @entity20 are allowed to dominate
@entity20 chief @entity118 has urged @entity74 to ' get their head down '
and if this @entity15 season is about @entity142 , tough
