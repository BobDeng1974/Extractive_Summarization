human rights commissioner @entity0 has again defended her decision to give $ 350,000 to a refugee who killed his pregnant wife			1
in a senate estimates hearing on friday , ms @entity0 was grilled by coalitions senators after she backed her recommendation that @entity8 should receive $ 350,000 in compensation for being ' arbitrarily ' held in a detention centre after the government ruled he was too dangerous to be integrated back into society			1
ms @entity0 said it was her role to remind the government of their ' international obligations ' and hold them accountable for breaching human rights			1
the human rights commissioner was forced to defend her decision in a senate estimate hearing after she recommended $ 350,000 be awarded to a man who killed his pregnant wife ' while the government of course has an executive power to detain someone , that executive power must be exercised in a way that is necessary and proportionate to achieve a legitimate aim , ' she said			1
' i think most fair - minded @entity28 would say that holding someone for eight years after he has served his prison sentence is something that does require at least the regular consideration of his case , and regular consideration of whether or not alternative forms of detention or supervision might be used			1
' mr @entity8 was involved in the @entity39 independence movement and gravely opposed @entity41 's occupation of his home			0
mr @entity8 reportedly canoed to @entity28 , arriving on 13 june 1985 he was granted refugee status in 1986 and reportedly committed a number of violent offences before beating his pregnant 28 - year - old partner and unborn child to death with a bicycle			2
after spending seven years behind bars for the horrific crime his sentence had come to an end however mr @entity8 was still deemed a danger to society			2
the government was not able to deport him because of his genuine asylum seeker status so instead they chose to release him into @entity58 , where he remained for a further eight years			0
the human rights commissioner said mr @entity8 's human rights were breached adding it was ' standard procedure ' to recommend compensation for anybody in @entity28 who had been detained ' contrary to those international obligations			2
' ' his human rights have been breached , and where there has been a breach , there is a recommendation for compensation ' ms @entity0 confirms his detention was lawful however her report claims the compensation estimate reflects the level of indignity mr @entity8 suffered through losing his freedom and liberty			1
' i appreciate the public wants to know how these sums are computed but again i think a fair minded person would say to be held for eight years without a charge , without a trial , and without consideration as to whether alternatives could be considered for this man , especially in light of the psychiatrist 's evidence that a management plan had not been developed for him , would consider the compensation proposed was a reasonable one , ' she said			0
mr @entity8 was held in @entity58 for eight years after a serving a seven year sentence challenging the government for her apparent trial by media ms @entity0 said they always had the opportunity to challenge her decisions , however rarely did			1
' normally it would be for members of parliament to read my reports , to question them if they chose to , and if appropriate , for the attorney to appeal against them			0
' that has not been done and unfortunately the choice has been made to do so in the pages of a particular newspaper , where the facts and legal reasoning were grossly misstated			0
' this is n't the first instance the relationship between the commissioner and the current government appeared strained			0
@entity114 has repeatedly called for ms @entity0 to resign from her position as human rights commissioner @entity114 publically slammed ms @entity0 for her 315 - page report into the treatment of children in detentions centres			1
the prime minister labeled it a ' partisan report ' and ' political - stitch up ' immediately demanding her resignation			0
ms @entity0 was allegedly offered a job by attorney general @entity127 in return for her resignation			2
shadow attorney general @entity129 wrote to the @entity130 at the time asking if mr @entity127 had in fact committed an offence by making the offer .			0

@entity0 came under fire in a senate estimates hearing on friday
she called for a refugee who killed his wife to be awarded $ 350,000
' fair - minded ' @entity28 should agree he *deserved* the money , she said
she claims @entity8 was ' arbitrarily held ' for the past eight years
after spending seven years in jail he was still seen as a danger to society
refugees ca n't be deported so he was held in @entity58
ms @entity0 said this was ' lawful ' but a breach of his human rights
