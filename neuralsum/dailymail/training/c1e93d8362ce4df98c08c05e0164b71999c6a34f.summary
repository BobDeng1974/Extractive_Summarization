a federal judge sentenced former @entity2 gov. @entity1 to two years in prison on tuesday , in a case that gripped the state and provided a cautionary tale for corrupt politicians across the @entity8			1
two years ago @entity1 was discussed as a possible presidential contender			2
now he 's headed behind bars for selling the influence of his office to the ceo of a dietary supplements company			2
' i stand before you as a heartbroken and humbled man , ' the former governor told @entity8 district judge @entity19 before he pronounced sentence			1
' i ca n't fathom any deeper humiliation for me and my family			0
' @entity1 will have to report to prison by 2 p.m. on feb. 9 – unless his lawyers can persuade the court to let him remain free while they appeal the jury verdicts			1
@entity19 quickly revised the report on federal sentencing guidelines for @entity1 down to a range of 6.5 to 8 years			1
he then chose to lower the boom more gently still , opting for a 24 - month sentence followed by two more years of supervised release			2
defense attorneys asked @entity19 to order three years of community service , arguing that the federal investigation that destroyed his career and exposed details of his rocky marriage and shaky finances was punishment enough			1
if @entity1 had received a sentence of ten years or longer , he could have faced time in a penitentiary that viewers of the show ' @entity75 ' would recognize			1
but his shorter term and the nonviolent nature of his crime virtually guarantees that he will serve his two years in a ' @entity80 ' - style minimum security facility			1
the @entity81 has broad discretion , although it usually factors geography into the equation to place inmates as near to their home as available bed space will allow			0
@entity2 is home to two minimum - security federal prisons			1
@entity89 is in @entity90 , @entity2 – only 25 miles south of @entity91 , where @entity1 was tried			2
@entity8 @entity92 in @entity93 is 300 miles to the southwest in the @entity95			2
both places are light on prison guards and host inmates who have greater freedom and more privileges than violent offenders housed elsewhere			2
the @entity81 's website describes ' minimum security institutions , also known as @entity104 , ' as institutions that ' have dormitory housing , a relatively low staff - to - inmate ratio , and limited or no perimeter fencing			1
' ' these institutions are work - and program - oriented , ' the agency says			0
' a number of @entity81 institutions have a small , minimum security camp adjacent to the main facility			2
these camps , often referred to as @entity117 , provide inmate labor to the main institution and to off - site work programs			0

@entity129 famously wrote to the court blaming her mother for the charges leveled against her father and pleaded for a softer sentence @entity1 's friends and supporters packed the courthouse before 10 a.m. sentencing hearing on tuesday			1
supporters included former @entity141 standout @entity140 and several state lawmakers			0
@entity1 's family members – including wife @entity35 , also convicted in the scheme – were in attendance as well			1
she arrived with her two sons , @entity147 and @entity148			0
more than 400 people had written letters asking the judge to spare @entity1 from prison , among them former @entity158 gov. and current @entity159 sen. @entity159 , co-workers , relatives and neighbors			1
several , including two of the @entity162 ' daughters , placed much of the blame with @entity1 's wife			1
daughter @entity127 wrote in a letter to the court : ' my mom ... has always been concerned about getting discounts or freebees [ sic ]			0
' she hid her coordination with people for free or discounted things or services and she did n't communicate with my dad because she knew he would not approve			0
... the testimony about my mom ... unfortunately , was the reality			0
' @entity127 added that she believed her mother suffers from mental illness , and that her father planned to address her health after leaving office last january			0
several charities had offered @entity1 volunteer positions , anticipating he might escape prison in favor of a community - service sentence			1
those included religious broadcaster @entity190 's @entity189 , which had jobs managing a hunger relief program in @entity193 and another working at an orphanage and fish farm in @entity196			0
@entity197 : @entity1 's cheering section tuesday included retired @entity199 football player @entity140 , who answered questions as he arrives for the sentencing hearing a jury in september found @entity1 and his wife , @entity35 , guilty of accepting more than $ 165,000 but less than $ 177,000 in loans and gifts – including a @entity39 watch and designer clothing – in exchange for promoting a nutritional supplement marketed as a miracle cure by @entity211 federal judge @entity19 will decide @entity1 's fate on tuesday the company 's former ceo , @entity213 , testified under immunity as the prosecution 's star witness			1
judge @entity19 ruled tuesday for the purpose of sentencing that the original value of the bribes was overstated , placing the value in the range of $ 97,000 to $ 121,000			1
and in a second silver lining for @entity1 , he dismissed one criminal count of obstruction of justice			2
@entity1 testified in his own defense during the six - week trial , acknowledging he accepted @entity213 ' largesse but claiming he did nothing for him in return other than extend routine political courtesies			2
@entity44 , who did not testify , will be sentenced feb. 20 on eight counts			0
the case prompted the @entity234 to tighten state ethics laws and some @entity2 elected officials have voluntarily limited the value of gifts they will accept			0
@entity213 testified under an immunity deal in the @entity1 case , admitting that he paid the governor with lavish perks in exchange for helping him secure university backing for his ' miracle cure ' products @entity248 : @entity1 could have gone to prison for ten years former @entity2 first lady , @entity44 ( right ) , shown in august , will be sentenced for her role in the scandal next month @entity1 , 60 , was once considered a possible running mate for @entity254 and inspired some talk of a 2016 presidential run of his own			1
he delivered the 2010 @entity258 response to the @entity259 and became chairman of the @entity261 in 2011			0
he was indicted 10 days after leaving the office once held by @entity263 and @entity264			0
former @entity2 governor and current @entity8 senator @entity159 is among @entity1 's supporters who argue he should be spared prison in favor of a lengthy community - service sentence at trial , the @entity162 ' defense strategy depended in large part on convincing the jury that their marriage was so strained they could not have conspired to squeeze bribes out of @entity213			1
they arrived at and left the courthouse separately every day and rarely even glanced at each other as they sat separated by lawyers at the defense table			0
@entity1 and other witnesses testified about the first lady 's erratic behavior , suggesting she was largely responsible for the cozy relationship that developed between the couple and @entity213			2
they said she was prone to such angry outbursts that the @entity290 staff threatened a mass resignation			0
one acknowledged calling @entity44 ' a nutbag			0
' prosecutors countered the broken marriage defense by showing the jury photos of the @entity162 holding hands as recently as at pretrial hearings			0
later , in their sentencing recommendation to @entity19 , prosecutors sought to turn the strategy against @entity1 by saying he has blamed others for his own misdeeds			1
defense attorneys also claimed @entity44 developed a ' crush ' on @entity213 , and several witnesses described her relationship with the wealthy vitamin executive as inappropriate and flirtatious			0
but nobody suggested the relationship was physical , and @entity213 testified that his dealings with the @entity162 were all business .			0

prosecutors had asked for a 10 - year prison term while @entity1 's lawyers are arguing for a lengthy community - service sentence
judge @entity19 revised report on federal sentencing guidelines down to a range of 6.5 to 8 years – and then gave an even shorter sentence
the former governor was convicted of accepting loans and lavish gifts in exchange for helping donor promote miracle - cure *weight* loss supplement
@entity1 's wife , who shared blame , will be sentenced in *february*
more than 400 letters of support have *flooded* the judge 's *chambers* , including the backing of former *guv* and current @entity8 senator @entity159
the new convict will likely do his time in a minimum - security federal ' prison camp ' rather than a more secure penitentiary
