an engineer who was told by cyclists that they never wore a helmet because they were ' an inconvenience to carry ' has come up with a solution - the folding helmet			1
@entity6 carried out his own study as to why urban cyclists and commuters felt the need to ditch helmets while cycling in cities			2
and his solution , the @entity15 helmet , neatly folds away to a third of its size in small bags			1
called @entity15 the £ 60 ( $ 95 ) product folds to a third of its size			1
it has a number of segments and hinges that let it be stored more easily			1
it also meets safety regulations and can be used by cyclists to @entity33 riders the @entity15 helmet , which costs about £ 79 ( $ 126 ) , was made by engineer mr @entity6 , 40 , from @entity21 , @entity34			1
he began his study when he noticed increasing numbers of people were using the @entity39 bike sharing system in @entity21 - similar to the @entity40 in @entity41			1
but he felt people were not sufficiently protecting themselves without a helmet			0
volume is divided by 3 when folded			0
size of the helmet when folded : 8.3 x 4.3 x 6.3 inches ( 21 x 11 x 16 cm )			2
weight : 490g ( one pound )			0
@entity49 shell is made of @entity51 plastic - inner shell is made of expanded polystyrene			0
the helmet has 14 vents			0
sold with inner fitting pads of various thicknesses to adjust the comfort of the helmet adjustable straps with chin protection ' many people immediately used those bikes to commute when @entity39 came in , ' he said			0
' drivers were not used to them and people started to say " it is dangerous , we 'll have many accidents "			0
' i wondered why those people were not protecting themselves with a bike helmet			1
' i asked urban cyclists why they did n't wear a helmet and the number one answer was the inconvenience of carrying your helmet with you when you 're not on the bike			1
' the other main reason was the look and style you have when wearing a bike helmet			1
' so i got the idea to create a folding bike helmet which is much easier to carry and store while also being chic and trendy			1
' the helmet meets safety regulations and can be used by cyclists , bmx riders and other people on a bike			1
the product is available in black or white ( shown ) and will come in two sizes the @entity15 helmet , which costs about £ 79 ( $ 126 ) , was made by engineer @entity6 , 40 , from @entity21 , @entity34			1
he began his study when he noticed more and more people were starting to use the @entity39 bike sharing system in @entity21 - like @entity40 in @entity41 he created the company @entity102 in december 2010 and began making prototypes , involving designers to improve its look and style			1
the result is a helmet which takes no longer than two or three seconds to stow away in a bag			0
it currently is available in one size , large / extra-large , which measures 23.2 to 24.4 inches ( 59 to 62 cm ) , although a smaller version is planned			0
the helmets are also open to customisation , with add - ons like covers and visors , and come in a range of colours			0
@entity122 answers @entity124 certification on bike helmets , meaning that despite targeting commuters and urban cyclists , it can be used by road racers and bmx riders as well			2
business partner @entity130 , 31 , added : ' people who have seen it really like the finishing quality of the product			0
' they enjoy manipulating the @entity15 and agree it is easy and simple to use			2
they realise in their everyday life that it truly brings a real value added			0
