by @entity0 this 12 - year - old girl 's trip to the circus ended up in the local hospital after she was bitten by a snake			1
@entity6 had been delighted when she and her mother and sister @entity8 had managed to get seats in the first row for a performance at the @entity13 circus in @entity14 , a city in north - western @entity15			2
but her excitement turned to fear that she was about to die after one of the circus performers took a huge snake down into the audience - which bit her on the arm			0
she was rushed to hospital by her grandmother after the attack when the circus was contacted by local media about the incident , management claimed it was the girl 's own fault because she had got too near to the snake despite being warned to take care			1
but video footage shows that far from approaching the snake , she had actually tried to squirm back into her seat to get away from it a second before it lashed out and fastened its teeth onto her arm			2
instead of taking time to see if she was okay , the snake charmer ignored the injury and carried on moving along the front row of the audience showing the snake to other young children and risking more children being bitten			1
before the attack , performers showed the audience the snakes , which were taken out of a wooden box on stage			0
they even dangled the reptiles over their heads from the stage after the girl was bitten the circus performer whisks the snake away , showing the snake to other children management claimed it was the girl 's fault because she had got too near despite being warned to take care terrified : the girl bursts into tears as her grandmother comforts her following her ordeal the young girl meanwhile was rushed out by her grandmother @entity72 , 63 , and taken to the local hospital because they feared she might have been poisoned			1
hospital staff that contacted the circus were told it was just a python and therefore non-venomous			0
she was given a tetanus injection and the wound was disinfected and bandaged , according to @entity80 , spokesperson of @entity81			0
the grandparents , who are furious that the circus blamed their granddaughter , have filed a complaint to police , who are investigating			2
