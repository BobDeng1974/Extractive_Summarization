glowing brightly on the tree , these colourful fairy lights look like they could have been bought yesterday			1
but they were actually purchased on a trip to @entity4 – 45 years ago			2
@entity5 has displayed them proudly in her living room every @entity8 since 1969 , and has only had to change one bulb			1
@entity5 , 65 , bought this set of @entity8 lights 45 years ago - and has only had to change one bulb mrs @entity5 believes the lights ( pictured left and right ) could be the oldest @entity8 lights in @entity14 she bought the lights during a lunch - time trip to @entity4 - and shelled out just £ 3 for the set they remain in place all year round because they are now too fragile to disassemble , but the 65 - year - old says they are ‘ still going strong ’ - and reckons they are the oldest @entity8 lights in @entity14			1
‘ i can still remember buying them , ’ said mrs @entity5 , who lives in @entity22 with her 35 - year - old son @entity23			1
‘ @entity25 had got round that @entity26 had a special delivery of lights from @entity29			2
' it was the second year i was married and i went in my lunchtime			1
they hold a lot of memories for me			0
’ it is estimated that the lights – which cost just £ 3 for the set – have been shining for nearly 30,000 hours			1
this equates to around three years of continuous use			0
and while they may be doing remarkably well for their age , they are far from the oldest decoration in the house			0
mrs @entity5 also has a christmas tree bought by her mother - in - law in the 1950s , which she displays in another room			1
the lights have been collectively shining for nearly 30,000 hours ( left ) - but are not as old as this @entity46 ( right ) which was bought by her mother - in - law in the 1950s talking about her lights previously , she commented : ‘ they really do n't make them like this anymore			1
‘ i ca n't imagine a set bought today - which are much pricier - lasting as well as these			1
' i guess you could say i 've had my money 's worth from them			0
' they 've never let me down and it 's looking as though they might outlast me now			0
’ her son @entity23 , 35 , a music teacher , said : ‘ i ca n't remember a time before the lights , they 've always been around			0
her son @entity23 , 35 ( pictured ) , a music teacher , said : ‘ i ca n't remember a time before the lights , they 've always been around ' @entity23 , pictured left and right , in 1982 with the reliable lights - which are older than he is ‘ they are older than me and have been here all my life			2
it 's been a constant and i hope they keep on working			0
’ and lights are not the only thing that have lasted since that shopping trip			0
mrs @entity5 said : ‘ i remember buying some wine glasses and tumblers at the same time			2
we still have those wine glasses			0
‘ you would n't expect to buy glasses now and expect to still have them in 40 years			0

@entity5 , 65 , from @entity22 , bought £ 3 lights during her lunchtime
they remain in place all year because they are too fragile to disassemble
