until now it was thought he acted alone it is more than 70 years since @entity3 's deputy , @entity2 , parachuted into @entity4 on an ill - fated peace mission to @entity10 which was thought to be a solo venture made without the @entity13 ' knowledge			1
but now the discovery of a blocked oil pipe on the remains of his crashed aircraft suggest that he must have had help from inside @entity21			1
while examining the remains of @entity26 at the @entity27 in @entity28 , authors @entity22 and @entity24 found that a crucial pipe had been blanked off with a large brass nut			0
they say that with only the main oil tank available @entity2 would not have been able to make the five - hour flight from @entity34 in @entity35 to @entity4 and would have been forced to land in northern @entity21 to refuel			1
in their new book on @entity2 , the authors say this means other people would have to have known about the flight and assisted @entity2 in keeping the plane on track			0
speaking to the @entity42 , mr @entity22 said : ' our recent discoveries have essentially destroyed the illusion of a solo flight by the deputy @entity47 who was trying to regain his former prestige			0
' our new work clearly demonstrates that the flight was planned in minute detail and required official support and connivance			0

@entity2 , @entity3 's right - hand man , had seen his influence over the @entity47 wain since the @entity68 's rise to power and the mission was seen as a desperate attempt to win back favour			2

@entity2 parachuted into @entity4 in 1941 on a peace mission
for more than 70 years it was *believed* he acted alone , *completing* the five - hour *journey* from @entity35 to @entity4 without stopping
new examination of his aircraft 's remains show a fuel pipe was blocked
with only the main fuel tank he would have refuelled in northern @entity21
authors claim officials must therefore have known what he was doing
