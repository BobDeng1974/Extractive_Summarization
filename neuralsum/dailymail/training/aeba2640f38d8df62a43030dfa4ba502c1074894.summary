victims : residents @entity20 , left , and @entity22 , right			1

a five - week inquest heard that residents were routinely given overdoses of medication , and were left soiled and in pain during two years of terrible mismanagement and staff shortages			0
@entity44 coroner @entity43 said the regulator ’s positive assessment of the £ 3,000 - a - month home a year before it closed was ‘ not fit for purpose ’			1

a coroner was scathing as sher delivered a verdict following a five - week inquest @entity73 , a former administrator who left in disgust and became a whistleblower , said she was asked to shred mrs @entity20 ’s medical records to cover up the blunder , and new ones were falsified			1
the inquest came on the day that health secretary @entity79 said the care of many elderly people in @entity82 is a ‘ national disgrace ’			1
a million older people are forgotten and isolated because no relatives and friends visit them			0
he promised new measures to beef up inspections of care homes after 112,000 cases of alleged abuse were referred by councils in @entity94 last year			2
whistleblower : @entity73 , former carer at @entity15 , who raised the alarm after 28 separate drugs failings on one night shift mr @entity79 said ‘ something is going badly wrong ’ in a society where potentially so many instances are happening every single week			2
it was revealed during the inquest that nurses shut doors on elderly people who called for help , an elderly woman was left in a toilet and forgotten , and parcel tape was used to secure a resident ’s dressing			1
miss @entity73 said the final straw was when she was told by a nurse that they had found 28 drug errors from just one night shift			0
she called police who arrived the next day			0
@entity15 was eventually closed down in late 2011 after another @entity17 probe found it had failed to meet eight of its essential standards of quality and safety			0
sussex police began an investigation and five people were arrested , some on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence in relation to mrs @entity20 ’s death			1
but there was judged to be insufficient evidence to prosecute			0

it is the latest scandal to hit the @entity139 watchdog , which is already under fire for failing to spot the scandal at @entity143 hospital where up to 14 babies died from neglect , and then allegedly trying to cover it up			2
the @entity17 was also accused of not doing more to stop the horrific abuse of disabled patients at @entity150 hospital in @entity151			0
@entity12 was once @entity82 ’s biggest care home operator , but collapsed with £ 1billion debts in 2011 after cost - cutting by a private equity firm , leaving 31,000 vulnerable residents stranded			1
the inquest heard the multi-million - pound home in @entity64 , near @entity159 , had a ‘ five star ’ feel when it opened in september 2009 , and its appearance ‘ seduced ’ families into believing it was well - run			2
but witnesses and former staff told how residents were treated with a lack of respect and dignity , and there were problems with medication and staffing levels			0
miss @entity43 said : ‘ there was institutionalised abuse throughout the home and it started , in my view , at a very early stage , and nobody did anything about it			0
‘ this , to me , was from the top down			0
it was completely mismanaged and understaffed and failed to provide a safe environment for residents			2
‘ it ’s a heart - breaking case			1
‘ we all have parents who will probably need care in the latter part of their lives			0
’ she said it was ‘ disgraceful ’ that the home was allowed to be run in the way it was and given a ‘ good ’ rating by the @entity17 in 2010 – a year before it shut			2
‘ i question how this could be the case and i question whether the inspection that did take place was fit for purpose , ’ she said			0
@entity206 , the daughter of @entity20 , said : ‘ how such terrible standards could go unnoticed by the authorities for so long has left us baffled			0
’ anger : solicitor @entity211 speaks on behalf of the families of the victims of ' institutionalised abuse ' at @entity15 care home this week the government announced a package of proposals to prevent abuse and neglect in care homes , including hidden cameras and ‘ mystery shoppers ’ reporting back on their experience			1
@entity211 , of @entity227 solicitors , which represented seven of the families at the inquest , described the case as a ‘ scandal ’ which should not be allowed to happen again			2
@entity234 , the @entity17 ’s chief inspector of adult social care , said the watchdog had to ‘ learn lessons ’ from the tragedy and a root - and - branch review had been launched			0
she said : ‘ this was completely unacceptable , and i extend my sympathies to the relatives of everyone who received poor care there			0
