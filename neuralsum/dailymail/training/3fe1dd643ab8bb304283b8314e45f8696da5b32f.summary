by @entity0 click here for the latest leaderboard from @entity3 the flagship event on the @entity5 appears set for a fabulous finish on sunday with two @entity9 @entity8 heroes pitted against the man who looks the future of @entity13 golf			1
as he has since day one at the @entity16 , @entity15 @entity14 will head into the final round with the lead but 20 year old @entity19 caught him on the 18th on saturday after holing a clutch 15ft putt for par. it meant the amazing @entity19 , who went so close to winning the masters last month , has now completed 54 holes on this devilish layout without a single bogey , and all on his debut as well			1
what a truly remarkable statistic that is given bogeys and much worse are lurking at every turn			0
up there : @entity15 's @entity14 shares the lead with 20 - year - old @entity19 the only other player to complete three rounds bogey - free in the history of this event was @entity37 way back in 1994			1
the pair stand on twelve under , with 29 year old @entity14 giving up the outright lead after an untidy finish that saw him fail to get the birdie on offer at the 16th and then bogey the last			1
there is so much at stake for @entity14			2
a victory here would not only earn him a cheque for $ 1.8 million but catapult the man who holed the winning putt at the last @entity8 firmly into the reckoning for this year ’s match at @entity52			0
it would also mean a return to the limelight after a lean period since his heroics at @entity59			0
that weak finish , though , will encourage his great pal @entity61 that he can complete a spectacular act of redemption of his own			2
@entity61 shot 69 to stand tied third alongside @entity65 @entity64 , with the pair just three shots off the pace			1
it was at this event last year that @entity61 declared his dislike of @entity72 to provoke a storm of controversy			2
in a shootout with @entity72 on sunday , @entity61 then put two balls into the water at the 17th			2
one last go : @entity19 caught @entity14 on the 18th and also goes in 12 under one minute he was playing for a first prize of $ 1.7 million and the next he was walking away with a cheque for $ 200,000			1
to compound his misery , @entity72 went on to win the event			0
now , a year has made a world of difference with @entity72 unable to defend his title and the temperamental @entity86 once more in the mix. on the other side of the ledger to last year ’s blow - up , @entity61 will also be able to draw on some good memories today			1
in 2008 , he claimed the biggest prize of his career to date with a win here			0
also in with a shout of his biggest - ever win is @entity98 , who won in @entity99 two weeks ago			2
@entity98 shot 71 , but might have cause to rue a poor finish of two bogeys in his last six holes			2
it meant he had to settle for a 71 and he will start five shots off the lead			0
disappointing : @entity98 shot 71 , but will rue a poor finish of two bogeys in his last six holes @entity108 champion @entity107 looked as if he would be starting on the same mark but he was assessed a two shot penalty after his ball moved a fraction on the 18th after he had addressed a chip from just behind the green			1
@entity115 thought it had moved , and the gut - wrenching news was later confirmed when he watched a slow motion replay			0
it meant a 73 instead of a 71 and a five under total that surely removes him from contention			0
the game could also see a new world number one , with @entity65 @entity125 and @entity126 poised to strike			0
newly - wed @entity125 needs to tip - toe into the top 16 to overtake @entity72 and lies two shots off that mark after a 69 on saturday			0
@entity130 is two shots nearer the lead on five under and three strokes off the top six placing he needs after a 70			0
picturesque : @entity61 of @entity135 hits from the 17th tee during the third round no such targets for @entity139 to play for on sunday , alas			1
this time last week he was saying he was getting a little bored playing for ‘ back door ’ top ten finishes , meaning coming through the field with a good final round			1
but that , for the third successive tournament , was his only goal as he began the final round in 28th place – ten shots off the lead – after a 69			1
for the second day in a row he recovered from an awful front nine with a fine inward half completed in just 31 shots			0
it means that for his first three rounds @entity139 has taken a total of 117 shots to complete the front nine – and just 96 blows to play the inward nine			0
how ’s that for a game of two halves ? against the rules : @entity107 received a two - shot penalty after his ball moved on the 18th			1

@entity15 's @entity14 and @entity13 @entity19 go in at 12 under
@entity64 and @entity61 trail by three going into the final round
@entity107 receives two - shot penalty for his ball moving on the 18th
