two or three cups of tea a day could keep osteoporosis at bay			2
tea drinkers are less likely to break a hip than people who never touch the stuff , a study found			1
two to three cups a day seems to be particularly beneficial with men and women who drank this amount being 37 per cent less likely to suffer a hip fracture			1
but not all drinks are equal			0
coffee has no benefit , the journal @entity16 reports			2
people who drank two to three cups were 37 per cent less likely to suffer a fracture than non tea drinkers it is n’t clear why tea is so good for the bones it may be that the plant chemicals in it boost the building of new bone			1
the fluoride , calcium and other minerals in tea likely make bones denser and so stronger			1
whatever the reason , the finding is important			0
some 3 million @entity36 have osteoporosis and it takes a heavy toll on health , despite various bone - strengthening drugs being available			1
around 300,000 weakened wrist , hip , spine and other bones are broken each year and 1,150 @entity36 die each month after breaking a hip			1
with many others losing their confidence and independence and hip fractures alone cost the country £ 2.3 billion a year in health and social care costs , anything that helps keep bone healthy could have a massive impact			0
the @entity57 researchers crunched together the findings of 14 previous studies into diet and risk of hip fracture			0
analysis of data provided by almost 200,000 people showed that tea drinkers were less likely to break a hip than others			1
one to two cups a day cut the odds of a hip fracture by 28 per cent , two to three cups reduced it by 37 per cent and three to four cups by 21 per cent			2
around 1,150 @entity36 die each month after breaking a hip and around 300,000 hip and other bones are broken each year the researchers , from @entity78 , do n’t say why two or three cups a day is more beneficial than three or four			1
however , they believe their figures may underestimate just how much tea strengthens bone			0
dr @entity82 , of the industry - funded @entity83 , said that tea contains more plant chemicals called flavonoids than coffee			1
it is thought that these speed up the building of new bone while slowing down the erosion of existing bone			0
fluoride , calcium and other minerals in tea likely also strengthen bone			1
the effect is n’t just due to the calcium in milk or coffee would also be shown to be good for the bones			2
however , professor @entity103 , of the @entity104 , cautioned that tea drinkers may have a particular lifestyle that influenced the results			2
he added : ‘ the absence of any important risk of hip fracture linked with coffee consumption is reassuring			2
‘ further research is needed to confirm whether or not there really are any bone health benefits linked with tea consumption			0
previous research has feted beer as being good for the bones			0
it is thought that high levels of silicon in beer slow down the thinning that leads to fractures , while boosting the formation of new bone			0
beer is also rich in phytoestrogens , plant versions of the female sex hormone oestrogen , which helps keep bones healthy			0
wine , like coffee , is of little or no benefit .			0

tea drinkers are less likely to break a hip than people who do *n't* drink tea
people who drank two to three cups were 37 *%* less likely to suffer a fracture
may be because the plant chemicals in tea boost building of new bone
fluoride , calcium and other minerals also make bones denser and stronger
the effect was not the same with coffee - which had no benefit , *experts* said
around 1,150 @entity36 die each month after breaking a hip
