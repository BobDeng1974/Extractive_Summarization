@entity0 has branded @entity1 as a ‘ genuinely tortured , angry individual ’			1
the @entity4 presenter said mr @entity1 , 64 , was barely able to hide his disdain for those he interviews – and that it had been a mistake to allow him to grill @entity8 and @entity9 last thursday			1
speaking at the @entity10 , mr @entity0 argued the former @entity13 host ’s aggressive interviews were ‘ not a good replacement ’ for debate between the prime minister and the @entity18 leader			1
‘ the thing about @entity1 is that he is a genuinely tortured , angry individual – and you get the real @entity1 , ’ mr @entity0 said			1
‘ he looks disdainful and contemptuous and furious with his guests because he by and large is			0
you ca n’t fake these things on television			0
’ however , mr @entity0 , 55 , suggested mr @entity1 had forgotten why the leader interviews were being televised and had allowed his own ego to get in the way			1
‘ no disrespect to @entity1 , but it would have been a lot more interesting had it been head to head , ’ he said			2
‘ replacing that with a good “ @entity45 ” for both of them , while entertaining , was not a good replacement			0
‘ there is a danger for all of us , as it were , in the interviewer ’s chair to forget that we are not the ones standing for election			0
‘ and i thought @entity9 did score [ in the interview ] when he said , “ @entity1 , you ’re important , but you ’re not that important ”			2
’ mr @entity0 , a former colleague of mr @entity1 , said it had been a mistake to allow the former @entity13 presenter to grill prime minister @entity8 and @entity18 leader @entity9 last thursday for the election debate a number of television critics said mr @entity1 dominated the show so strongly that viewers might have finished wanting to vote for him rather than either of the party leaders			1
however , mr @entity0 ’s comments went down badly with viewers , who accused the @entity4 political editor of being ‘ supine ’ , ‘ sycophantic ’ and having an ‘ inflated sense of his own importance ’			1
others speculated mr @entity0 ’s remarks were driven by jealousy			1
the two men spent nearly 15 years as colleagues at the @entity4 , until mr @entity1 quit last year			2
but they have had relatively little to do with each other			0
mr @entity1 hosted a series of documentaries and fronted @entity83 ’s flagship current affairs programme , @entity13			0
mr @entity0 , who started out as a newspaper journalist , has spent the past decade at the helm of @entity87 ’s sunday current affairs programme , the @entity88			2
he also fronts @entity91 ’s @entity90 each monday			0
speaking at the @entity10 , mr @entity0 said @entity1 ’s aggressive interviews were ‘ not a good replacement ’ for a debate between the two political leaders a @entity4 source said executives were ‘ very surprised ’ by mr @entity0 ’s outburst , as the two men never really ‘ trod on each other ’s toes ’ even when they worked together			1
but mr @entity0 made it clear he prefers a friendlier approach than the aggressive line of attack for which mr @entity1 is renowned			1
‘ i have never believed that the right approach to a political interview is to say to the interviewee , in effect , “ you ’re a scoundrel , you ’re a liar , and i ’m going to treat you like that ” , ’ he said on friday			0
‘ the best i can do is to ask intelligent questions , keep eye contact – intelligent , sensible questions that the alert viewer would want to be asked			0
‘ and if they ’re not answered , ask them again			0
and if they ’re not answered then , just make it clear to everybody that @entity118 or @entity119 has not answered the question and move on			0
viewers have accused mr @entity0 , who has hosted @entity87 's sunday - morning current affairs programme for the past decade , of being ‘ supine ’ , ‘ sycophantic ’ and having an ‘ inflated sense of his own importance ’ ‘ we do n’t have to be this kind of really , really aggressive opposition all of the time			1
’ mr @entity1 is known for doggedly pursuing a line of attack , once asking then home secretary @entity133 the same question 12 times in a row			2
that aggression was clear last thursday when he took mr @entity8 and mr @entity9 to task , in two separate interviews			2
the prime minister was asked to defend soaring immigration , whether he could live on a zero - hours contract , and made to squirm over his close ties with former @entity145 host @entity144			0
mr @entity9 ’s grilling was so severe the presenter asked him at the end : ‘ are you ok , @entity9 ? are you all right ? ’ however , when mr @entity1 told the @entity18 leader his party would never get a majority , mr @entity9 said the broadcaster does not get to decide who wins .			1

@entity0 said it was a mistake to allow @entity157 to grill @entity8 and @entity9
he suggested @entity1 had allowed his ego to get in the way of the debates
@entity0 , who called @entity1 ' disdainful and furious ' , now accused of jealousy
@entity4 source said executives were ‘ very surprised ’ by mr @entity0 ’s outburst
