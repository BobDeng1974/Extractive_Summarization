a factory has been accused of bringing in a jeweller to cut off workers ' wedding rings as part of health and safety rules			1
unions claimed staff were in tears at having the rings removed , some for the first time since their wedding day			1
however , the firm – @entity15 , which makes sterile medical equipment and employs more than 700 people in @entity18 – said it had simply brought in a jeweller to resize the rings to make them easier to remove as part of the safety drive			1
unions claimed staff were in tears at having the rings removed , some for the first time since their wedding day			1
they added that workers had only agreed to the measure because they had a ' gun to their head ' a leaked memo suggests the rules have been introduced after a worker lost a finger when they got their wedding ring caught on a piece of equipment			1
@entity41 , regional officer for the @entity43 union , said : ' there are women in tears , women whose husbands put that ring on their finger 20 or 30 years ago and it has never been taken off			2
' he added : ' i work with plenty of people in factories who wear gloves or tape [ over their jewellery ] , but they have said no to that			0
they have even had a jeweller here cutting people 's rings off			2
' a memo sent out on december 15 said the new rules will come in on february 1 , this sunday , for workers in the operational , warehouse and toolroom areas , and anyone who works with equipment			0
but it says stud earrings , necklaces , body piercings covered by clothing and medical bracelets will still be permitted			0
while mr @entity41 acknowledged workers had been informed , he said the lack of information in the interim meant they thought the company had changed its mind			0
@entity15 , which employs more than 700 people at its @entity18 site , pictured – said it had simply brought in a jeweller to resize the rings to make them easier to remove as part of the safety drive he said : ' apparently it 's on health and safety grounds which is , quite frankly , ridiculous			1
there is no health and safety reason and no hygiene reason			0
' mr @entity41 said that while workers have agreed to the policy , it is only because they had ' a gun to their heads ' and wanted to keep their jobs			1
a spokesman for @entity15 said : ' we have implemented a policy that excludes the wearing of jewellery , or any other personal items , in those areas in which they could constitute a safety risk			0
' we understand that a small number of our associates may be unhappy , and we are sensitive to their feelings , but our overriding priority must be workplace safety			0
' we have offered associates who were unable to remove their rings the opportunity for a professional jeweller to come to the site to resize their rings			2
this is entirely voluntary and the cost is being paid by @entity15 '			0
