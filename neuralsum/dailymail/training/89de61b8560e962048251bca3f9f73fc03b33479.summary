@entity2 safety @entity1 should not have been penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct when he dropped to his knees in prayer after an interception , the @entity0 said on tuesday			1
the league 's rule book prohibits players from celebrating while on the ground , but spokesman @entity11 wrote in an email on tuesday that ' the officiating mechanic in this situation is not to flag a player who goes to the ground as part of religious expression , and as a result , there should have been no penalty on the play			2
' the flag thrown in the fourth quarter of @entity2 's 41 - 14 victory over the @entity27 on monday led to criticism on social media , with many wondering how it was different from players such as former @entity0 quarterback @entity32 dropping to one knee in @entity35 prayer			1
penalty : @entity2 safety @entity1 received a 15 - yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after he dropped to the ground and performed the @entity39 ( above ) during monday 's game against the @entity27 big play : @entity1 had just intercepted a pass from @entity43 ( above ) and ran it back into the end zone further punishment : the @entity0 may also fine @entity1 ( above ) as well @entity1 is a devout muslim who took a year off from @entity48 to make a pilgrimage to @entity50			1
he said after monday 's game that he knew before he even reached the end zone he would drop to his knees in thankful prayer after intercepting @entity43			1
after he slid to the grass in @entity57 , yellow flags came flying from the officials			2
' i do n't think it was because of the actual prostration that i got the penalty , ' @entity1 told @entity63 afterward			1
' it was because of the slide			0
' and that 's precisely the explanation that @entity69 coach @entity68 said he received from the game officials			2
they had no issue with the prayer , @entity68 said , only the celebratory slide			0
' i 'm pretty sure he ( @entity68 ) understands who i am , what my faith is , ' @entity1 said			1
' and again , the prostration is all right			0
come to a full stop , get down , make the prostration , get up and get out			0
' faith : @entity1 ( above , with his son @entity83 ) is a devout muslim who fasts during @entity86 pilgrimage : @entity1 ( above , with his son @entity83 ) also sat out the 2012 season so he could visit @entity50 during the @entity89 in october no response : @entity1 ( above ) has yet to comment on the call the @entity92 , a civil liberties and advocacy organization , issued a statement early tuesday asking that the @entity0 take steps in response to the penalty			1
' to prevent the appearance of a double standard , we urge league officials to clarify the policy on prayer and recognize that the official made a mistake in this case , ' @entity92 spokesman @entity99 said			0
@entity68 did n't agree with the penalty , but he also did n't make much of it			2
' when you go to @entity50 , ' he said , referring to the end zone , ' you should have the privilege to slide anywhere you want to slide			0
we have two priests in here			0
they will vouch for me			0
' indeed , there were two pastors sitting in @entity68 's postgame news conference			0
tebowing : giving praise following touchdowns and major plays is common among many players in the @entity0 , most notably @entity32 ( above ) @entity1 is in his second year with the @entity2 after spending an entire season away from the game			1
he decided that , in the prime of his career , he would join his brother @entity128 - who also was playing in the @entity0 at the time - to make a pilgrimage to @entity50			1
the @entity130 of @entity131 is the hajj , the pilgrimage that all @entity134 are supposed to make once in their lifetime			0
@entity1 , who also fasts during @entity86 , told the @entity63 in an interview last year the brothers wanted to make sure they did the pilgrimage while they still had the health and means to go			1
in the case of @entity128 , it proved costly			0
he never got a shot to return to the @entity0 .			2

@entity1 received a 15 - yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after he performed the @entity39 on monday night
@entity1 intercepted a @entity43 pass and returned for a touchdown
@entity0 admit that @entity1 penalty was wrong and he should not have been punished
