the new technique , @entity95 , involves tailor made plates being pinned to the broken bones to speed up recovery and alleviate pain each plate is about half an inch wide and is shaped to match the contours of the ribs			1
until recently , the only treatment for broken ribs was to strap them up and take painkillers until they had @entity109 now recovered , ms @entity0 said : ' it 's been a bit of a joke with friends and colleagues referring to me as ' barbed wire ' instead of @entity0 and also the ' bionic woman ' ' i realised that this surgery was quite novel and i 'm lucky to have had this technology and procedure on my doorstep , in @entity123			1

' it 's been a bit of a joke with friends and colleagues referring to me as ' barbed wire ' instead of @entity0 and also the ' bionic woman ' !

' @entity85 , consultant trauma and orthopaedic surgeon , said : ' with this technology the procedure we use not only reduces the risk of complications but encourages a faster return to normal function			2
' it is only recommended for patients who have suffered severe chest trauma with multiple broken ribs			1
' the results and patient outcomes have been excellent for patients like @entity0 at the both the @entity69 and @entity152 hospitals			2
' until recently , the only treatment for broken ribs was to strap them up and take painkillers until they had healed			1
this could take months and left the patient in danger of complications such as breathing difficulties , pneumonia and chest deformity			0
the new technique , @entity95 , sees patients undergo a 2 hour operation which is available both on the @entity167 and privately			0
during the surgery , tailor made plates are pinned to the broken bones to speed up recovery and alleviate pain			1

the plates are left in the body for the rest of the patient 's life .			0
