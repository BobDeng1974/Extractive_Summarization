@entity0 said today viewing the film showing @entity3 's murder by an @entity5 extremist may be illegal - but experts believe any prosecutions for watching it would be ' absurd '			1
the @entity9 also urged people not to spread the gruesome video over social networks like @entity13 and @entity14 , warning they could be arrested			2
the film shows mr @entity3 , 40 , kneeling in a desert - like environment at an unknown location as an @entity19 fighter stands by his side dressed in black and with his face covered			1
the killer , who is believed to be @entity23 , accused @entity24 of ' aggression towards the @entity27 state ' for its attacks on @entity19 , before murdering mr @entity3			2
the force said : ' the @entity41 is investigating the contents of the video that was posted online in relation to the alleged murder of @entity3			1
' we would like to remind the public that viewing , downloading or disseminating extremist material within the @entity23 may constitute an offence under terrorism legislation			1
' government sources today confirmed that @entity52 has seen a full version of the video following his return to @entity56			1
the film has spread across the internet and has potentially already been seen in some form by millions but the police and @entity61 would find it difficult to prove an offence had taken place , an expert told @entity66			1
human rights barrister @entity67 said : ' for disseminating a terrorist video to be an offence you would have to very clearly encourage the activity shown , for example to say that you think what the terrorists have done is excellent and encourage others to do the same			2
' but even then there is a defence if you can prove that the message did not represent your views , or was in fact sarcastic			0
‘ in theory if you had downloaded the video to your computer you could be in trouble , because possessing terrorist material is an offence regardless of your intent , similar to possessing child pornography			0
but streaming the film is unlikely to be an offence			2
you would have to be streaming it for the purposes of encouraging or committing terrorism			2
‘ but merely viewing it - it is difficult to see how that could engage even the very wide terrorism laws			0
there would also be no public interest in prosecuting a someone for viewing if they did n't intend to promote @entity19			0
so for the @entity9 to say that viewing a video in and of itself could constitute an offence seems to me to be far from reality ’			1
appalling : the killing of @entity3 has shocked the world but police and @entity13 have taken steps to stop it spreading the footage appears to then show another captured journalist , @entity115 , who went missing near the border of @entity117 and @entity118 last year			0
his life depends on the @entity24 president 's ' next decision ' , the @entity19 fighter warns			0
the film has not been verified but the journalist 's family have accepted that it shows his death and foreign secretary @entity128 said the footage appears to be genuine			0
mr @entity3 's mother @entity130 released a statement saying : ' we have never been prouder of our son @entity133			1
he gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the @entity117 people			0
' we implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages			0
' mr @entity52 returned to @entity140 just two days into his family holiday in @entity142 to lead the response , posting on @entity13 : ' if true , the murder of @entity3 is shocking and depraved			1
i will today chair meetings on the situation in @entity148 / @entity117			0

@entity0 warns against viewing , downloading and disseminating of film showing @entity3 's murder
' it may constitute an offence under terrorism legislation , ' @entity9 has said
legal expert told @entity66 an arrest for viewing the film would be ' absurd '
but publishing it with aim of ' encouraging ' or aping it would be an offence
government sources confirm @entity52 has seen the film in full
