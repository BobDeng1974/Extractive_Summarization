this is the moment an angry sea lion took revenge on fishermen after being caught in their nets and dragged on board their boat			1
the @entity8 fishing off @entity8 's @entity9 were hauling in their nets when they discovered a huge sea lion thrashing about inside and lowered it to the deck			2
but after helping the animal to get free one of the fishermen was not quite quick enough and was grabbed on the shoulder in the jaws of the furious creature and flung across the boat like a rag doll			0
the sea lion is left looking as if it is about to start tackling the other fishermen as well , but the crew say they eventually managed to drive it back into the water by using a powerful hose normally deployed to clean the deck			1
adult male sea lions can weigh over 400kg , while females weigh 85 - 160kg , and according to experts who studied the @entity8 video , the animal caught in the nets came from the @entity59 species of sea lion , a near - threatened species found off northern @entity9 coasts from @entity62 to @entity63			1
@entity65 treatment : after throwing the fisherman the sea lion then lost its temper with the the ship 's dog the sea lion was cut free by the fishermen after becoming caught in one of their nets the fishermen stand back as the sea lion escapes from the net water a good idea : the huge creature was eventually hosed back into sea the @entity59 sea lion is the largest of all five species found in the world			1
it hunts fish , squid , octopus and occasionally , smaller seals , and although the males are especially aggressive , particularly when defending harems of up to 25 females in the breeding season , it is believed the sea lion on the @entity8 ship was a female			0
every year many sea lions are accidentally drowned by fishing boats and fishermen are obliged to report deaths			0
most of the animals suffocate after being kept underwater in the huge nets			0
the @entity59 sea lion is the largest of all five species found in the world			2

@entity8 fishermen net a huge @entity59 sea lion by *mistake* in northern *pacific*
after they cut the animal free it turns on one of the crew and grabs him
the fisherman is then flung with huge force across the deck of the boat
the animal is then hosed off the deck of the ship and back into the water
