by @entity0 armed forces at a nuclear missile base failed a drill last summer that simulated the hostile takeover of a missile launch silo because they were too slow , it emerged today			2
an internal @entity9 review revealed the failure happened because security was unable to speedily regain control of the captured nuclear weapon			1
the previously unreported failure , which the @entity9 called a ' critical deficiency , ' was the reason the @entity18 at @entity19 in @entity20 flunked its broader safety and security inspection			1
the underground command console from where the @entity9 could launch nuclear missiles in the event of war , at the @entity29 launch control center , @entity20 the security team was required to respond to the simulated capture of a @entity33 3 nuclear missile silo , termed an ' @entity35 ' scenario in which a nuclear weapon is lost , stolen or seized			1
each of the @entity9 's 450 @entity33 silos contains one missile armed with a nuclear warhead and ready for launch on orders from the president			1
the review was obtained through a @entity46 request and sought to examine why the security force showed an ' inability to effectively respond to a recapture scenario			1
' it cited their failure to take ' all lawful actions necessary to immediately regain control of nuclear weapons ' but did not specify those actions			2
the prize for terrorists or others who might seek to seize control of a missile would be the nuclear warhead attached to it			2
in 2009 , the @entity9 cited a ' post- 9/11 shift in thinking ' about such situations , saying that while this nightmare scenario once was considered an impossibility , the @entity65 ' no longer has the luxury of assuming what is and what is not possible			1
' an internal @entity9 review has revealed a failure at @entity19 in @entity20 the frozen plains of @entity20 as an unusually bitter winter grips the midwest captain @entity75 , who oversees maintenance crews , exits a icbm nuclear missile silo after a leak of glycerol ( file picture ) the inspection failure was one of a string of nuclear missile corps setbacks revealed over the past year			1
the force has suffered embarrassing leadership and training lapses , breakdowns in discipline and morale problems			2
earlier this year , defense secretary @entity91 ordered two parallel nuclear reviews , still underway , to address his concern that these lapses could erode public trust in the security of the nation 's nuclear weapons			2
the safety and security of nuclear weapons under military control is considered of paramount importance , and thus defense agencies perform detailed and rigorous inspections at regular intervals			0
when the @entity9 publicly acknowledged the inspection failure in august , it said ' tactical - level errors ' had been committed during one phase of the inspection , but it did not say the errors were made by security forces			1
at the time , the @entity9 declined to provide details , saying to do so could expose potential vulnerabilities			1
security forces , safety officers , logistics teams , missile launch crews and others participated in the @entity122 inspection			0
lt col @entity123 , a spokesman for @entity124 , which is responsible for the nuclear missile corps as well as the nuclear - capable bomber aircraft , said wednesday he could not comment further			0
missile maintenance technicians of the 90th @entity128 at @entity129 , @entity130 ( file picture ) a @entity133 rocket is launched from @entity134 in @entity135 ' we can not divulge additional details of the scenario or the response tactics due to it being sensitive information that could compromise security , ' @entity123 said			0
he added that all ' countermeasures , ' or corrective actions , that were proposed in the review obtained by the @entity145 have been accomplished			1
the only exception is a plan for more extensive practicing of security response tactics at launch silos , a move that requires signed agreements with owners of the private land on which the missile silos are situated			0
the august 5 to 13 , 2013 , inspection , designed to evaluate management and handling of nuclear weapons to ensure they are properly controlled at all times , was repeated two months later and found no security weaknesses			0
security forces are responsible for a range of protective roles on the @entity9 's three nuclear missile bases , including along roads used to transport missiles and warheads to and from launch silos ; at weapons storage facilities ; and at launch silos and launch control centers			1
the @entity9 operates three @entity33 3 bases — in @entity175 , @entity20 and @entity130 — each with 150 missiles			1
the partially censored document provided to the @entity145 describes in broad terms the nature of the inspection failure , its significance and its underlying causes			2
senior airmen @entity184 , left , and @entity185 mount a refurbished nuclear war head on to the top of a @entity133 missile inside an underground silo in @entity190 , @entity191 ( file picture ) it said insufficient training was at the heart of the problem , beginning with a lack of familiarity among the security forces with ' complex scenario ' exercises			0
it also cited unspecified shortcomings in ' leadership culture ' and a lack of standardized simulations not only at @entity207 but throughout the nuclear missile corps			0
among the corrective measures cited in the report : arrange to hold recapture exercises at one launch silo among the 50 silos in each of the 341st 's three @entity33 squadrons , using ' realistic , varied , simple - to - complex ' scenarios based on what the @entity217 calls its ' local nuclear security threat capabilities assessment			0
' also , the @entity9 is taking steps to more closely track lessons learned from each ' recapture ' exercise			1
the @entity9 declined to further explain the august exercise scenario , but the document provided to the @entity145 indicates that a security force team was told to recapture a @entity33 missile launch silo within a certain time limit			1
it did not identify or otherwise describe the team , but each @entity33 missile base has ' tactical response force ' teams specially trained and equipped for nuclear weapons recapture and recovery missions			1
two years ago , the @entity9 promoted these teams as a ' secret weapon ' ensuring nuclear security , saying they are provided ' an extensive amount of unique training and are expected to perform flawlessly in whatever scenario thrown their way			1
' it is not clear from available records precisely what @entity122 's security forces did wrong or inadequately in the august exercise			0
a section apparently elaborating on what was meant by the phrase ' failed to take all lawful actions ' was removed from the document before its release last week			0
the @entity9 said this information was withheld in accordance with senior - level @entity217 orders ' prohibiting the unauthorized dissemination of unclassified information pertaining to security measures ' for the protection of ' special nuclear material			1
' labeling the security forces ' misstep a ' critical deficiency , ' the report said that because security of nuclear weapons is paramount , ' the inability to demonstrate effective recapture / recovery @entity267 ( tactics , techniques and procedures ) detracts from the wing 's ability to conduct its day - to - day mission			1
' colonel @entity277 , who was commander of the 341st wing at the time of the failure , said at the conclusion of the inspection that to publicly reveal details of the results would ' give @entity65 's adversaries far too much information about how we operate			2
' despite the inspection failure , ' there was no question about our capability to operate safely and with complete confidence , ' @entity277 said , adding nonetheless that more needed to be done to ensure that ' some very young airmen ' understand their responsibilities ' much more clearly			2
' nine days later he fired the officer in charge of his security forces , col. @entity300 , and replaced him temporarily with colonel @entity301 in march , @entity277 resigned amid a scandal involving alleged cheating on proficiency tests by up to 100 missile officers at @entity207 , and the @entity9 replaced @entity277 with @entity306			2
in an interview in january , @entity277 suggested there had been disagreement about how the security exercise was conducted during the august inspection			0
without providing specifics , he said it was simulated ' in a way that we 've never seen before , ' adding : ' it confused our airmen			0
we were off by a matter of seconds			0
' the 341st has had other security - related problems over the past year			0
it disciplined two launch control officers who broke security rules on may 31 , 2013 , by leaving open the blast door to their underground command center when a maintenance person arrived while one of the two crew members was asleep			0
compounding the error , the crew commander and his deputy initially lied to their squadron commander in an attempt to hide the violation			0
the 341st also has at least two missile launch officers under criminal investigation for alleged illegal drug use or possession .			0
