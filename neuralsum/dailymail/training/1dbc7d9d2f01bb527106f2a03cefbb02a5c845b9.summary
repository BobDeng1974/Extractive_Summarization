@entity0 's has announced it is pulling @entity2 ingredients from its most popular chocolate snacks after complaints from thousands of consumers			1
its biggest sellers , including @entity9 and @entity10 , will start featuring ' simpler ingredients ' this year , the @entity7 confectionery giant announced last week			1
the company is also dropping emulsifier @entity14 ( @entity14 ) and artificial vanillin , the @entity12 reported			2
@entity14 reduces the viscosity of chocolate and is used by companies as a replacement for expensive raw ingredient cocoa butter			2
the decision comes amid a growing backlash against ' @entity23 '			0
critics of @entity2 ( @entity2 ) foods consider them environmentally suspect and a possible health threat			1
but many in the food industry insist the foods are safe , the technology boosts food production , and its use is less environmentally harmful than traditional farming methods			1
changes : @entity9 ( left ) and @entity10 ( right ) will start using ' simpler ingredients ' this year , the company said - in a move applauded by @entity39 demonstrators @entity0 's joins other companies including @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 in responding to consumers ' demand to remove @entity2 ingredients from products			1
and just last week , @entity48 announced that it will cut artificial colors and flavors from its @entity7 confectionery by the end of 2015			0
@entity0 's acted after tens of thousands of people urged the company to drop @entity2 ingredients on their @entity56 page and through emails in a relentless campaign led by @entity59			1
but in a statement , @entity60 , co-chair of @entity59 , said that @entity0 's has further to go			1
' @entity0 's needs to take the next step and go @entity64 with all of its chocolates , and get third - party verification for @entity64 ingredients			1
this includes sourcing milk from cows not fed gmos and agreeing to prohibit any synthetic biology ingredients , starting with vanilla , ' he said			0
complaints : @entity0 's was flooded with complaints from people calling for them to drop gmo ingredients celebration : many thanked the company after the decision - while others accused them of caving in to pressure , saying there is no scientific evidence proving that @entity2 products are harmful ' consumers are increasingly looking for @entity64 products and verification , and @entity0 's and its competitors would be wise to offer third - party verified non-gmo products to consumers			1
' much of @entity94 , including @entity95 and @entity96 , wants to ban @entity2 crops amid concerns over their impact on the environment , food and human health			1
the administrations in @entity104 and @entity105 also oppose the technology having seen the problems that have emerged in the @entity7 , such as superweeds , which have proven difficult to control			0
but @entity109 and @entity110 support the technology and are keen to see the crops in the fields and on dinner plates as soon as possible			0
last month , the @entity115 voted for a new approvals process in growing @entity2 crops - meaning that they could appear in @entity109 fields from next year			0
the system will allow each country to decide for itself whether or not to grow a @entity41 crop â€“ once it has been ruled safe by @entity121 , which is the @entity123 's food safety body			2
critics of gmo foods consider them environmentally suspect and a possible health threat			1
they fear that pollen from @entity41 plants will spread to other conventional and organic crops , so polluting the entire food chain			0
but many in the food industry insist the foods are safe , the technology boosts food production , and its use is less environmentally harmful than traditional farming methods			1
the move comes after @entity0 's said last december that it was exploring transitioning away from high fructose corn syrup			1
it announced its decision last week			0
' we all want and deserve to know what 's in our food , ' said the company 's president and ceo @entity146 in a statement			2
' we will strive for simplicity with all of our ingredients , but we may not achieve it with every product			0
this is a journey and it will take time			0
' we are equally committed to sharing what we achieve and what we do n't			0
for ingredients that may not be as simple , we will explain what they are and why we need them to provide the great flavors , aromas , textures and appearances that our consumers know and love			2
' the company said the new ingredients would be more expensive but promised to maintain consumer prices , the @entity12 reported			1
gmos are plants and animals that have had been created by mixing dna from different species to make a new one			0
they are found in many strains of corn , sugar beets and soy , among other foods			0
there has been debate over the health impacts of the technology , and there has been a push throughout @entity94 to drop what critics have dubbed ' @entity23 '			2
last may , @entity190 ruled that @entity41 food must carry a label - the first state to make labeling a legal requirement			0
the legislation will come into force in 2016			0
debate : critics say genetically modified foods are environmentally suspect and harmful to consumers ' health , while supporters say that the technology boosts food production and that they are safe to eat @entity205 and @entity206 have previously passed laws requiring labels on gmo foods , but their laws do n't take effect unless neighboring states follow suit			1
last year , the @entity214 said in a statement that scientists and regulators worldwide recognize that foods made from genetically modified crops are safe			2
' and these same @entity41 crops have enabled farmers to produce more on less land with fewer pesticide applications , less water and reduced on - farm fuel use , ' bio vice president @entity220 said .			0

@entity9 and @entity10 will start featuring ' simpler ingredients ' this year , the company announced
it comes after pressure from @entity39 activists , who claim the technology is environmentally suspect and a possible health threat
others in the food industry insist the foods are safe and less harmful to the environment , and that the technology boosts food production
@entity0 's says the new ingredients will be more expensive but it is committed to keeping prices the same for consumers
