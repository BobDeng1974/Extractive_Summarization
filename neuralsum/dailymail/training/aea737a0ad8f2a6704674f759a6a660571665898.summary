@entity0 insists the way forward for @entity2 is to ditch the 4 - 4 - 2 formation			1
if that is the case then it would seem unlikely @entity2 will ever win the @entity6 under their @entity8 manager			2
why ? just take the @entity9 years for a start			2
@entity11 , pictured at @entity12 , has said he twitches his ' ass ' on the bench when his play 4 - 4 - 2 @entity2 have often struggled to create while playing @entity11 's favoured 3 - 5 - 2 formation fans were heard chanting ' 4 - 4 - 2 ' during @entity2 's 2 - 0 win against @entity19 at @entity12 last weekend since its inception in 1992 every title winner - @entity2 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 - have played with four at the back			1
mostly their formations have been 4 - 4 - 2 , with variations on that theme			1
in recent seasons there has been a move to 4 - 5 - 1 or 4 - 3 - 3 and twists to those basic shapes often in the guise of an anchor midfielder			2
but the bedrock has been the same : four at the back			0
and , prior to that , no team that won the old @entity40 did so playing with three at the back on a regular basis			2
there were occasions in the @entity46 and @entity47 when @entity48 – @entity49			0
@entity50 , @entity51 - and @entity22 – @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 ( and later @entity55 ) did play 3 - 5 - 2 on their way to titles , although in the case of the @entity61 under @entity62 it was more like 5 - 3 - 2			1
this five at the back line - up was at times akin to the famous catenaccio tactic favoured in @entity65 for decades until @entity66 swept all before them with 4 - 4 - 2			1
defenders @entity70 , @entity52 and @entity54 were often deployed in a 3 - 5 - 2 formation with @entity22 there were also occasions when @entity48 trialled the formation with @entity75 , @entity50 and @entity51 @entity76 formation : when three at the back was the rule but essentially you would have to go back to the 1950s to see when three at back was the rule rather than the exception in @entity87 as the old ‘ @entity76 ’ formation evolved into what became the accepted shape of a team numbered one to 11 ( pictured right )			1
1 goalkeeper , 2 right back , 3 left back , 4 right half , 5 centre half , 6 left half , 7 @entity94 winger , 8 inside right , 9 @entity98 forward , 10 @entity99 left , 11 @entity101 winger			2
this was 2 - 3 - 2 - 3 or 3 - 2 - 2 - 3 depending how deep the centre half sat. it was under @entity105 at @entity106 at the start of the @entity108 that 4 - 4 - 2 was really born in @entity109 when he withdrew his no 6 ( a certain @entity110 ) to play alongside the centre half in the role of attacking centre back rather than defensive midfielder			1
four at the back then became de rigueur			0
most teams played 4 - 2 - 4 , which is 4 - 4 - 2 with attacking wingers			1
but after ditching his during @entity87 ’s 1966 @entity122 win , @entity119 and his ‘ wingless wonders ’ defined for some time the @entity109 way			0
@entity11 has said this system makes his ‘ ass twitch ' because it unbalances his @entity2 team , even though they have won more games this season playing that way than in any other shape			1
the 4 - 4 - 2 was really born in @entity109 when @entity130 withdrew @entity110 to a deeper position although @entity11 never played a senior match for @entity133 he was brought up in the @entity108 and @entity134 at the club which became famed for creating @entity136			1
it was essentially a fluid 3 - 4 - 3 which came to the fore with @entity140 at the 1974 @entity122 finals			1
the great irony is that the man who would have created @entity11 ’s mistrust in the @entity109 way was , well , @entity109			2
the guru of @entity136 - according to the kingpin of @entity133 and @entity140 at the time , @entity146 - was @entity150 who was born in @entity151 in 1915			2
@entity150 played as a wing half for @entity153 between the wars			0
in 1959 he quit as @entity156 manager to take over at @entity133 for two seasons			0
he returned for another spell in 1964 setting down the @entity136 template			0
@entity119 's ' wingless wonders ' at the 1966 @entity122 defined the @entity109 way for some time @entity146 ( left , of @entity133 ) and @entity0 ( right , of @entity161 ) grew up playing ' @entity136 ' while @entity146 dismisses @entity11 as a control freak he eulogises about @entity169 , who at the start of the @entity134 was manager of @entity172 ( yes , really ) , the club where @entity146 would star as a player then a coach , laying down the foundations of the mighty team we have seen in recent years			1
but @entity172 even in this ‘ modern era ’ ( as if men like @entity169 were not ‘ modern ’ in their day ) play four at the back , although their shape like great rivals @entity177 is a 4 - 3 - 3			1
in short it ’s the surest way of defending across the width of the pitch			0
if you have attacking full backs in that system then you have to have one or perhaps two midfielders who are prepared to hold			0
that ’s also known as flexibility			0
of course it is naive to label and pigeon - hole formations			0
at any given time of a game you will see one shape morphing into another			0
but even the best teams need a starting shape			0
@entity140 's formation in the 1974 @entity122 was a fluid 3 - 4 - 3 , with @entity146 the star man up front @entity140 are an exception , as since then nearly every great side have succeeded with four at the back essentially the great @entity202 team of 1970 was 4 - 4 - 2			1
but with so many great players and great movement the front six was more a carousel than a system			0
there is another irony here : at international tournaments since 1966 @entity87 have performed better when ditching 4 - 4 - 2			1
in 1990 under @entity211 and then @entity212 98 under @entity213 @entity87 played with 3 - 5 - 2 sweeper system , more like @entity215 of those days , and did well			1
although @entity218 ’s ‘ christmas tree ’ system at @entity219 had a back four it was a long way from rigid straight lines of 4 - 4 - 2 that can limit a team and even promote the long ball as it did in @entity225 ’s @entity87			1
but , as wise managers will say , the bottom line is identifying what shape suits your players best			0
generally the better players a manager has , the better his team will be			0
@entity202 's side from 1970 are one of the best in history and played 4 - 4 - 2 - though the front six moved freely that is not the case if the players are shoehorned into a game plan that does n’t suit them individually or collectively			1
for a while at @entity244 and then @entity23 , @entity213 saw some success with 3 - 5 - 2			2
@entity247 has used the system with various teams from time to time			0
@entity250 did so at @entity251 and then @entity252			0
but they are exceptions and not the rule			0
under sir @entity255 , @entity2 enjoyed season after season of success using 4 - 4 - 2 , often with a twist , which usually saw the second striker operate as a @entity260			1
the rest of @entity255 ’s tactics were pretty straightforward : a back four , two central midfielders working in tandem ( one ‘ sticks ’ if the other ‘ twists ’ ) , two attacking wide men , an ‘ inside forward ’ and a centre forward			0
@entity213 was a believer in 3 - 5 - 2 and had some success with @entity87 but this seems to be an exception yet 4 - 4 - 2 gives @entity11 a twitchy ass ? the @entity8 says it affects the balance of the team			1
perhaps that ’s because he has got the balance of his squad wrong			0
either 3 - 5 - 2 or 3 - 4 - 3 just does n’t seem to get the best of the talent he has at his disposal			1
as @entity285 says it slows the team down too much			0
the only time @entity255 said he had a ‘ twitchy ass ’ - aka ‘ squeaky bum time ’ - was during the run - in for the title			2
it ’s a position clipboard - toting @entity11 wo n’t in this season			2
whether he likes it or not , history proves that four at the back is the key to success in the @entity9			2
sir @entity255 stuck to 4 - 4 - 2 , and reaped the rewards over 26 years at @entity301 @entity2 always had a dangerous front two , while midfielders covered several roles the system got the best out of stars such as @entity308 ( left ) , @entity309 ( centre ) and @entity311 ( right )			1

@entity0 said he had a ' twitchy ass ' watching his side play 4 - 4 - 2
but @entity2 have been a huge success playing the formation
every successful @entity9 side have played four at the back
not to mention @entity202 in 1970 , and the modern @entity172 stars
@entity11 may have got his beliefs from the guru of @entity136
