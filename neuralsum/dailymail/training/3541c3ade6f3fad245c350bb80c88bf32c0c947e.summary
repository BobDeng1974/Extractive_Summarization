@entity3 - whose real name is @entity3 - appeared on @entity5 's @entity4 to try and raise awareness of the condition			1
at the height of her depression - triggered by the death of her mother in 2011 - she says she felt permanently numb and cried for 24 hours a day			1
' there was just a big gaping hole in my life and i was too scared to leave the house , ' she told presenters @entity24 and @entity25 and dr @entity26 , the resident gp			2
@entity3 , the undisputed star of @entity30 â€™s controversial documentary series , is seen as the famous matriarch of @entity8 in @entity32			1
but she says her depression left her a prisoner in her own home and it was only because a friend took her to the @entity27 that she is now on medication			1
she explained : ' when my mum passed away it left a real hole in the family			2
i used to speak to her 10 - 15 times a day and see her nearly every day			2
' she said she initially coped with her grief by trying to care for her father			2
' i went into overdrive			2
i am the elder sibling so i started obsessing over @entity46			0
we have a real old - school @entity46 worked , @entity49 did all the cooking			0
' i sort of jumped in , thinking he was useless - but he was n't			0
i was trying to protect him , but in the end , he had to say " back off , stop ringing me 10 times a day "			0
' once i realised @entity46 was ok , there was nothing to do			0
there was just a big gaping hole			0
' i was locked away in the house , too scared to leave and @entity49 was n't coming back			1
' @entity3 said she then began lying to friends about where she was , to prevent her reclusiveness from being discovered			1
she admitted that because of the taboo surrounding depression , she probably would n't have sought help had a friend not taken her to the gp			1
psychological symptoms of depression include : continuous low mood or sadness , feeling hopeless and tearful , being irritable and intolerant of others , not getting any enjoyment out of life and having suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self - harm			1
physical symptoms include : a change in appetite or weight , disturbed sleep - especially finding it hard to fall asleep at night or waking early in the morning - loss of libido and a lack of energy			1
today , @entity3 takes the antidepressant sertraline and is under the care of her local mental health team			1
' the only thing i do n't do any more is cry 24 hours a day , ' she added			0
' you start taking antidepressants and you stop crying , but just feel numb , permanently numb			1
' she admitted that she sometimes also feels suicidal			0
when quizzed about her matriarchal role and the fact that on the show she always seems to be helping others , she replied : ' we were filmed every day for 18 months - there might have been a week when someone else was looking after the kids because i could n't do anything and could n't move			0
' some people have said to me : " you do n't look depressed "			0
' people throw the word around and say after a bad day " oh i 'm so depressed " - but it kind of feels personal [ and strange to have it used like that ]			0
' i let it go over my head - i have to concentrate on myself			0
' and despite depression being the most common mental health issue - affecting nearly a fifth of adults and 80,00 children and young people - depression is still one of society 's taboos , resident gp dr @entity26 explained			1
unknown : @entity3 admitted to presenters @entity24 and @entity25 that people have said : ' you do n't look depressed ' ' telling someone they do n't look depressed is a ridiculous way to assess someone , ' he said			1
' i have had severe depression three times - i remember once sitting crying in the toilets before going on air to do a live phone - in - on depression			2
' you ca n't just " pull yourself together " - you need help , so see a doctor			0
you will get better if you take treatment and medical advice			0
