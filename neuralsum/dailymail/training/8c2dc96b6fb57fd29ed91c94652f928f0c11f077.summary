' the mother said @entity0 , meanwhile , seemed totally uninterested in consoling the girl			1
' i do n’t think i ’ll ever forgive him for that , ' the mother told producers			1

' now , as @entity3 's headache grows thanks to an unprecedented email leak , they 're likely counting their lucky stars that @entity0 did n't take the threat a step further			1
