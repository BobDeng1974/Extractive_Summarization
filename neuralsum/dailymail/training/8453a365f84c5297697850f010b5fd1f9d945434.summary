big top : @entity22 performs with lion at the @entity13 , which no longer uses big cats animals have been used in circuses since the 18th century and around 20 were using them in 2000			1
but the @entity26 has promised to fulfill the previous @entity28 's pledge and outlaw it altogether			0

' but @entity72 , editor of @entity74 circus magazine , said there are good examples of trainers on treating animals very well in @entity79 , where they are still a popular attraction			0
he added : ' they 're doing very interesting displays			0
it 's not the old old style of a man with a whip and a chair			0
' these are sensitive displays that show the animals ' affection for humans and humans ' affections for animals			0
' the @entity13 sent its tigers to @entity98 in @entity18 , which made headlines last year when one of its elephants escaped and ran through @entity103 , and one of its trainers was later crushed by open of the animals			1
