by @entity0 shocking news : that enchanting friend of the @entity4 gardener , the robin , is disappearing and an insalubrious monster , the pigeon , is taking over			1
if you do not believe me , just look at the figures from last week ’s @entity13 ’s @entity12 survey			1
in the past 35 years , sightings of pigeons in our gardens has increased sevenfold , or a horrible 743 per cent , while robins have reduced their cheeky , inquisitive appearances by 45 per cent			1
disgusting : in the past 35 years , sightings of pigeons in our gardens has increased sevenfold , or a horrible 743 ¿ per cent i suppose there ’s someone who welcomes a pigeon into their garden			1
probably the same person who feeds them in @entity28 before retiring out of range			2
but the truth is , pigeons are stupid , irritating , destructive and ugly			1
the ugly part is worth pursuing because , objectively , they should be rather handsome — imagine one stuffed and put into a glass case , with its tightly packed blueish - grey feathers , its smart white collar and pink - tinged waistcoat			2
in life , however , they somehow end up being quite hideous			2
words like brutish come to mind — their lumbering walk , their heaving take - off into flight , their bullying of smaller feathered friends on the bird table , their uncouth approach to building nests , their coarse cooing which can only appeal if heard from faraway woods on a good - tempered evening			2
a faraway wood is just the place for them , but they think they should be in the garden			1
i concede this does show a certain amount of intelligence — they like seeds and young greens , which , in one form or another , are found in gardens , so they opt for the easy life			1
but in doing so they drive us gardeners mad			2
how often does the conscientious , hard - working , home - owner in his veg patch find his spring plantings descended on by large fat birds unafraid of scarecrows or even waving arms ! i no longer have a vegetable garden			2
my pigeon problem is closer to home			2
decline : robins have reduced their cheeky , inquisitive appearances by 45 ¿ per cent the stone walls of my house in @entity84 are decorated with many different climbers			1
there is a wisteria , now more than 100 years old , growing along half the south - facing front of my house , which gradually gives way to a 40 - year - old vine			1
on another side there is a @entity94 rose and jasmine			2
elsewhere there are climbing hydrangeas and cotoneasters , which all add to the beauty of the golden stone			0
the only trouble is that pigeons firmly believe that these climbers are there to provide support for nests			1
their approach to architecture is to throw random twigs at a couple of branches , and hope they turn into something to hold their eggs — and their lumpy , ungainly selves			0
at least this scatter - shot approach gives warning of their arrival			0
i keep a stick handy to poke out the nests before they become cosy			0
sometimes , if i have been away for a week or two , it may become a close - run thing between my stick and the arrival of the pigeon ’s eggs			0
my conscience has allowed me to evict eggs , but never chicks			0
last year , the pigeons were on the winning side in this eternal battle			1
according to the @entity13 , there are 5,400,000 breeding pairs of wood pigeons in the @entity4			1
worse still for us pigeon non-fanciers , they are quite capable of having several families , with two or three eggs per nest , in the course of the year , particularly when the weather is mild			0
problem : according to the @entity13 , there are 5,400,000 breeding pairs of wood pigeons in the @entity4 i do not assert that the pigeons are intrinsically bad			1
they do not stick their eggs in other birds ’ nests like the cuckoo			0
nor do they behave like the top bird varlet , the jackdaw , which takes a malevolent pleasure in stuffing chimneys or any unsuitable cracks it can find with a massive cascade of twigs			0
but those birds have not risen to fifth place on the @entity13 list			1
how long will it be before pigeons knock the blue tit off its perch at @entity170 ? i did n’t always dislike them			1
in my childhood , i used to go out in the field and woods with my brothers who were shooting pigeons , and felt quite sad when they downed one			1
i was fond , too , of reading stories about brave carrier pigeons that were such heroes in both @entity183			1
even this year i was moved by the story of a @entity186 pigeon named @entity187 that delivered his message despite being gravely wounded			0
he was patched up and given a wooden leg , but died a year later — when it was discovered he was actually a hen , so should have been called @entity193			0
i also understand that many people like pigeons — and not just on their dinner plate			1
my husband grew up in the @entity198 where there were always men breeding racing pigeons alongside their allotments , and the racing business is still thriving			1
growth : they are quite capable of having several families , with two or three eggs per nest , in the course of the year , particularly when the weather is mild the @entity211 has some of the most impressive racing birds in the country at her loft in @entity215 , and there is a multitude of internet sites offering well - bred racers for sale			0
it strikes me that this may be a clue to the problem of the pigeons in our gardens : they are under - employed , under - exercised , used to loafing around and getting what they want without having to make much effort			1
they should be bravely fighting for their existence , roosting in high trees far from predators — if only there were some — or , even more commendable , saving men ’s lives in wars , or entertaining fans with their swift flight			0
instead they are spoilt , over-weight and greedy , barging their way onto bird tables and gobbling up everything in sight			0
even if you hang a pigeon - proof bird feeder from a bough , they still cause chaos , stomping about beneath it for any pickings and trampling everything underfoot — a disaster if that feeder happens to hang over a flower bed			0
moreover , they regularly steal my morello cherries before i can turn them into jam ( i know i could use a net , but they always beat me to it )			0
flying high : the @entity262 has risen in the @entity13 list of birds which are thriving in @entity4 gardens in the summer i only have to take a deckchair and sit under a tree in a quiet corner of the garden for a pigeon or two to arrive over my head , clattering and banging among the leaves before embarking on a frantic cooing routine , which sounds more like a pneumatic drill			1
the saddest thing about this rant is that i really do love birds			0
i would be prepared to love pigeons if there were n’t so many of them and they did n’t invade my garden			2
i even planted a little wood to invite in birds and was thrilled to see in the @entity13 list that the @entity286 has moved up in the ranks			1
i suppose if there were hundreds of them tapping at every tree i might begin to be less keen on them			0
i am sorry that the sparrow and the song thrush are decreasing in numbers			0
i am happy to say that in my garden there is no shortage of robins and it ’s quite common to see two of them fighting over territory on my wall			2
my week is made if i hear an early cuckoo as i did last year , and i easily forgive its wickedly irresponsible behaviour			0
so my pigeon problem is essentially about numbers and habitat			0
the only place i am able to admire pigeons nowadays is in @entity311 paintings whose artists somehow manage to turn their annoying plumpness into stateliness			2
they are often paired with peonies or flowering cherry trees , which they inhabit with a proprietorial air , little round eyes gleaming complacently			0
i think i could just about hang one of these			0
but in the end i have to agree with that discerning writer @entity323 who penned the one line that succinctly sums up my attitude to pigeons in the garden : ‘ pigeons on the grass , alas			2

sightings of pigeons in gardens has increased by 743 per cent in 35 years
robins have reduced their cheeky , inquisitive appearances by 45 per cent
according to the @entity13 , there are 5,400,000 breeding pairs of wood pigeons in the @entity4
