with his bright , inquisitive eyes and wagging tail , on first glance he looks like an ordinary pet			2
but this is actually a mocked - up image of @entity7 ’s ideal dog , comprising different parts of several breeds to create the perfect furry friend			2
the coat of an @entity18 bulldog , the ears of a @entity12 and the tail of an @entity15 setter help make up a set of ideal characteristics voted for by 2,000 pet owners			0
the perfect dog also has the body size of a border collie , the snout of a labrador and the eyes of a beagle			1
almost half said their ideal dog would be ‘ standard - sized ’ like a collie , compared with 36 per cent who preferred smaller lap dogs such as chihuahuas			1

when it came to naming their pets , 29 per cent of owners said they opted for ‘ human ’ choices such as @entity63 or @entity64			0
the dog has the soft fluffy ears of the @entity12 ( right ) which 24 percent preferred our ideal dog would have the tail of an @entity70 ( left ) a third of owners want their dog to have a ' short - haired ' and ' low maintenance ' coat - like an @entity34 but slightly more – 33 per cent – preferred traditional dogs ’ names including @entity76 and @entity77			1
