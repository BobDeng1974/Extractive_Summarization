proud : @entity7 , mother of murdered @entity1 , shows off her obe following the investiture ceremony tragic : @entity1 was just 20 when she was beaten to death by a gang of teenagers ' i ’m sure she would be proud			1
to be here , and we can talk about it , ca n’t we ? - you ’re here in @entity26 - it ’s very special ... ' it ’s not just about the work that we do , it ’s a validation of the work that we do and of the alternative subcultures as well			2
' mrs @entity7 said she was touched that prince @entity33 knew about her 20 - year - old daughter 's tragic death in 2007			1
miss @entity7 was with her boyfriend @entity36 , 21 , when she was set upon by drunk teenagers in a park in @entity39 , @entity40			1
the gang turned on her and mr @entity36 , who survived the attack , because of their alternative appearance			0
horrifically , miss @entity40 was kicked and stamped on while she knelt on the ground , cradling the injured mr @entity36			1
both fell into comas but miss @entity40 , a gap - year student , never regained consciousness and died in hospital 13 days later			2
goths are not often seen at @entity26 , but mrs @entity7 wanted to add a touch of her late daughter ’s style for her audience with the @entity11			2

when i was younger i was always quite different , but i really never had the balls to dress like that			0
but i like the touches			0
' heartbreaking : although @entity1 died , her boyfriend @entity36 , 21 , did survive the appalling attack sympathetic : prince @entity33 , pictured at an earlier event with @entity75 , passed on his sympathies proud : others to be honoured by @entity33 included @entity78 and dr @entity79 delighted : newly minted @entity80 holds up her award following the investiture ceremony she said she hoped her charity , which aims to challenge prejudices towards people from alternative subcultures and campaigns on hate crime legislation , would offer troubled youngsters hope			1
