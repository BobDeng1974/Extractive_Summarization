there ¿ s a whole wilderness out there that is only accessible by foot			0
@entity18 's camera - armed @entity16 cars have caused controversy wherever they 've driven - but now the search giant is to ' go offroad '			1
@entity18 's new @entity23 backpack cameras will allow the search giant to explore back yards , footpaths and even the wilderness			1
describing the previous @entity30 as ' not much of a map ' , the @entity29 company unveiled a new technology that fits the previously car - mounted cameras inside a bacpack			1
the company has already tested the cameras ' in the wild ' - but it 's unclear as to how much of the world @entity18 plans to explore			1
' today , we ’re taking another step forward with our @entity41 , ' said the company this week			0
' you ’ve seen our cars , trikes , snowmobiles and trolleys — but wheels only get you so far			0
there ’s a whole wilderness out there that is only accessible by foot			0
' @entity2 solves that problem by enabling us to photograph beautiful places such as the @entity54 so anyone can explore them			0
all the equipment fits in this one backpack , and we ’ve already taken it out on the slopes			1
' @entity16 is banned in countries such as @entity61 over privacy concerns			1
@entity18 also announced a complete overhaul to the imagery on @entity30			2
the search giant has sent a convoy of planes over major cities in the world , each plane capturing advanced @entity72 information and detailed photographs			0
the result will be a complete @entity72 experience of major cities across the world , allowing users to swoop and fly through replicas which are exact - with even trees getting the 3d treatment			2
' it ’s a pretty limited search engine that only draws from a subset of sources , ' said @entity18 via its official mapping blog , referring to the current state of @entity16			1
' in the same way , it ’s not much of a map that leaves you stranded the moment you step off the highway or visit a new country			0
over the last few years we ’ve been building a comprehensive base map of the entire globe — based on public and commercial data , imagery from every level ( satellite , aerial and street level ) and the collective knowledge of our millions of users			0
' @entity18 showed a demonstration of a @entity72 map of @entity105 , in which a user can navigate around an aerial view of the city @entity18 headquarters in @entity110 , @entity29 today 's @entity112 announcement revealed @entity18 now has camera planes which have taken images like this of @entity105 it is the next step of @entity18 's controversial plan to create a photo - based map of the world - and it will begin rolling out before the end of the year			1
@entity18 is also planning to introduce offline support to @entity30 , in a bid to offset the expected loss of traffic from @entity126 and @entity127 users , with @entity128 set to launch their own competitor to @entity30			2
both @entity130 and a technology blog called 9to5 have reported that @entity128 next week will make a move to drop @entity30 , which currently comes pre-loaded on all @entity126 and @entity127 products .			0
