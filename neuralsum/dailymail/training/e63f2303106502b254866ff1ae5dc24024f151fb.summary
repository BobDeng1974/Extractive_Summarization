@entity11 , 63 , said she was ‘ astounded ’ to see photographs of staff from the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) ‘ living it up ’ at taxpayers ’ expense as they celebrated at the prize ceremony			1
the award – which was given to the trust despite it repeatedly missing patient targets – was handed over just months after an inquest into the death of her husband of 38 years , @entity24			1
angry : @entity24 and @entity11			2
mr @entity26 died at his home , near @entity28 , after the ambulance turned up late in heartbreaking testimony , the inquest was told how mrs @entity11 , a retired civil servant , made four increasingly desperate 999 calls begging for an ambulance to come and help her 74 - year - old husband , eventually telling operators : ‘ it ’s too late now , he ’s gone			1
’ it later emerged that as mrs @entity11 was making her calls , six of the 16 ambulances serving her area had been on mandatory rest breaks , another eight were queuing outside two hospitals to hand over patients , and the remaining two were dealing with other incidents			1
when the inquest concluded , coroner @entity46 criticised the service and demanded action from the trust to reduce the risks posed by paramedics taking mandatory breaks and delays in dropping off patients at @entity56			1
but within weeks of the hearing , bosses were applying for the @entity59 in @entity60			0
and , despite consistently failing to meet the government ’s target that ambulances should attend at least 65 per cent of the most serious call - outs within eight minutes , the trust won the @entity66 award			1
@entity67 attended a ceremony in @entity69 earlier this month to pick it up			2
pictures from the night show them dancing and celebrating after their win			2
mrs @entity11 , of @entity72 , near @entity28 , @entity73 , said she was ‘ astounded ’ by the award			1
‘ it is unbelievable that a trust which , month after month , fails to achieve its targets is actually being rewarded for incompetence , ’ she said			0
‘ they are missing targets and people are dying because of it			0
‘ i do n’t think the general public are aware that they are wasting time putting themselves up for these kind of awards when their performance is so dire – for them to win it beggars belief			0
‘ what really grates is that they were preparing to submit their application for this award when the inquest was taking place			0
it makes me so angry , it ’s such an insult			0
i would n’t mind if they had made changes outlined after my husband ’s inquest and gave themselves some time before applying , but the fact they did this at the time of the inquest is horrifying			2
’ staff from the @entity14 celebrate their award in @entity69			1
the @entity14 has met the government target in just one month over the past two years mrs @entity11 said she was particularly offended by pictures on social media of @entity14 staff ‘ living it up ’ at the awards party			1
‘ the photo showing the representatives all dressed up enjoying themselves is an insult to the people who are no longer here , ’ she added			0
mrs @entity11 complained to her representative in the @entity124 , @entity126 @entity125 , who described the award as a ‘ sick joke ’			1
‘ what the @entity14 have done is at best insensitive , ’ he said			0
‘ they are missing these targets month on month			0
’ figures for may 2014 show that only 54.1 per cent of ambulances in @entity135 arrived at the scene of a life - threatening category a call within eight minutes – down from 62.5 per cent the previous year			0
the @entity14 has met the target in just one month over the past two years			0
in response to an email of complaint from mrs @entity11 to the @entity14 , a spokesman said : ‘ the trust acknowledges that our emergency response times have been consistently below target for some time and recognises we must change this urgently			1
‘ the trust is working diligently in order to develop our clinical practice			0
therefore at each opportunity where our staff have contributed to the trust moving closer to this goal we want to celebrate , recognise and announce our pride in our workforce			2
