@entity0 detailed a story from a time when the couple was in @entity42 , @entity43 , where @entity11 left in camouflage gear but later returned in a trench coat covering an evening gown soaked with blood			1
earlier in the hearing , @entity0 had said his ex told him she was a mercenary who killed for money , and showed off pictures of bodies with gunshot wounds			0
@entity55 , who was once a personal assistant to the couple , also said @entity11 claimed she was a trained killer for the @entity58 government , saying she once told him , ' i take down foreign governments			1
' he also said @entity11 told him in september she had been body slammed by a big man while helping round up immigrants at the @entity67 border , but said he considered the story ' far - fetched			2
' ' everybody on the outside can tell me i 'm crazy , but i lived on the inside and saw it firsthand , ' @entity0 said when his attorney , @entity73 , questioned why he still believed @entity11 is a hired killer			2
intrigue : the @entity27 star said @entity11 claimed to be a trained assassin and said she partly inspired the @entity20 operative @entity77 ( pictured ) from the film @entity22 about the hunt for @entity24 split : @entity0 testified monday that he decided to end his relationship with @entity11 after a race last fall because she was monopolizing his schedule and he needed to focus on racing kiss of death ? : @entity55 , who served as personal assistant to the couple , said @entity11 spoke about being a government assassin , and once told him ' i own @entity61 ' though neither @entity11 nor her attorney refuted @entity0 's recounting of events during the four - day hearing , @entity11 called the claimed ' ludicrous ' during an interview with the @entity96 tuesday night			1
she also suggested @entity0 pulled them from a script she was writing that @entity0 had proofread			1

@entity139 , a @entity140 music minister who performs at @entity27 outreach events and befriended @entity0 and @entity11 , said @entity11 told him on the night of the alleged assault only that @entity0 had pushed her and that she hit her head			1
@entity139 said @entity11 was upset , angry and brokenhearted , but that she never said she was afraid of @entity0 and seemed intent on reconciling			0
that attitude shifted in the weeks that followed , @entity139 said , with @entity11 going ' from a broken heart looking for love and reconciliation to anger and a little bit of revenge			0
