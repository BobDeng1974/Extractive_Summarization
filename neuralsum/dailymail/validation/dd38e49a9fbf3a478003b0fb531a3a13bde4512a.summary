a lesbian has created a unique sex toy , which also serves as a means of at - home artificial insemination			0
@entity5 , a reproductive health expert from @entity6 , came up with the clever concept , which she named the @entity8 , after examining the other available methods of at - home fertilization open to her and her wife			1
' the only options other than going to a doctor 's office would be with a turkey baster or a needle-less syringe , ' ms @entity5 told @entity18 about her creation , which retails for $ 139.99			1
' there is nothing romantic or sexy and fun about trying to impregnate your wife with a turkey baster			1
' moving on up : ms @entity5 is hoping to release a second version of the unique sex toy later this year the mother - of - one began looking into alternative designs , which would use the same pump - based technology as a turkey baster - one of the more traditional at - home means of artificial insemination - but also enable the user , and their partner , to enjoy the process of impregnation			1
and while ms @entity5 initially intended for the toy , which comes complete with a pump , to be used by lesbian couples , she explained that it will actually serve as a great fertilization aid for anyone who might not be able to get pregnant using traditional means - and who does not want to go through @entity62			2
' when my wife and i wanted to start a family , we thought about our options and were n’t necessarily happy with any of them , ' she added			2
' i started thinking , what if i could recreate the technology that a turkey baster would provide , but in the form of a sex toy ? ' that would be the perfect scenario - it would not only allow both partners to be really involved in the process , but it would allow for privacy and authenticity and intimacy			1
' ms @entity5 and her wife @entity22 , who used the @entity8 when conceiving their one - year - old baby daughter @entity23 , have received an outpouring of support and praise from a variety of people from different communities			1
thus far , the entrepreneur 's unique creation has been used by transgender and transsexual couples , men with erectile dysfunction and even heterosexual couples , who , ms @entity5 explained , still ' enjoy the sensation ' of using the @entity8			2
the @entity100 is widely thought to be the most common means of at - home artificial insemination			0
tradition : a turkey baster ( pictured ) can be used as a means of at - home insemination while some women choose to use a traditional turkey baster , a needle-less syringe will also serve the same purpose			1
the method involves women using semen from their boyfriend or husband , or from a willing donor , which they then inject into themselves using a turkey baster or a needle-less syringe			1
women who are eager to use this method are advised to attempt it on the day of ovulation and the 2 - 3 days before ovulation			0
while the success rate of the turkey baster method is thought to be reasonably high , some women , like the @entity8 's creator @entity5 , have complained that it causes discomfort , and it is not known to be particularly enjoyable for the user			1
however , the method is still favored by women who do not wish to undergo @entity62			0
indeed , the product has proved so successful that the businesswoman has launched a new crowdsourcing campaign on @entity140 in the hopes of funding the @entity26 2.0 , which will come in a wider variety of colors , shapes and sizes , according to its website			0
' up to this point , we [ have ] manufactured 500 units in three realistic colors , @entity152 , ' ms @entity5 explains on her @entity154 page			0
' with your contribution , we will manufacture the @entity157 in new non-realistic color options ( tell us what color you want to see ) , make different sizes of the toy , larger bulbs ... and use a softer silicone to enhance the comfort and feel of the toy			0
' and ms @entity5 insists that the @entity8 should not just be viewed as a means of insemination - but can also be used by couples , or single people , who are looking to get a bit more creative in the bedroom			2
' i ’ve had people use this at bachelorette parties , and they put alcohol in it , ' she added to @entity18			0
' you have to take into consideration what you ’ll be introducing into the body			0
a lot of people will use lubricants ... ' it sort of depends on what your desires are , but the most common things in there are probably lubricant or other stuff that 's okay to be put on or in the body			0

@entity5 wanted to come up with a way to get her wife pregnant , without having to use a ' turkey baster or a needle-less syringe '
the reproductive health expert invented the $ 139.99 @entity8 , which uses the same technology as a turkey baster but can also be used for pleasure
