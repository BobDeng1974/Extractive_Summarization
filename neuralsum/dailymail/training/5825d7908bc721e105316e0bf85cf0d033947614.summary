@entity0 , the former @entity1 managing director who has now spent 130 days in a @entity3 jail cell , has issued an explosive statement protesting his innocence while revealing no criminal charges have yet been brought against him			1
@entity0 has been accused by his former employers and former @entity1 owners @entity8 of falsifying invoices and diverting money into accounts controlled by him			1
the figures that have been reported amount to around £ 4million			0
but @entity0 , who is still waiting to even be questioned by the authorities in @entity3 despite having shared a cell with two or three other prisoners at the @entity19 since may 18 , has enlisted the services of forensic investigators at @entity22 in a bid to clear his name			1
@entity0 ( centre ) has issued an explosive statement protesting his innocence @entity0 , who is still waiting to be questioned by the authorities , was the frontman and deputy ceo of @entity3 - based bankers @entity8 when they bought @entity1 from @entity30 in december 2012			1
he then became managing director of the football club and introduced current owner @entity33 to @entity8			1
once the takeover had occurred the controversial @entity34 dispensed with the services of @entity0 , who had resigned from @entity8 and as managing director of the club			1
in may @entity8 released a statement confirming 36 - year - old @entity0 had been arrested ‘ on suspicion of fraud , embezzlement and money - laundering while he was employed at the bank			1
’ since then a high court judge has imposed an interim asset freezing order on @entity0 , with mr @entity47 pointing to the fact that @entity0 was facing allegations of ‘ false invoice fraud ’ in criminal and civil proceedings in @entity3			2
the judge said he was satisfied that @entity8 had a ‘ good arguable case ’ and said there was evidence of a ‘ risk of a dissipation of assets ’			0
but @entity0 claims he is the victim and in a detailed statement issued through his representatives on thursday he said : ‘ i have now been held in jail for 130 days during which time no criminal charges have been brought against me			1
nor have i been questioned or examined in any way about any criminal matters			0
‘ under the cynical guise of what i believe is essentially a vindictive commercial dispute , my former employers @entity66 ( @entity8 ) through their lawyers , @entity68 , have publicly accused me of illegally and deliberately diverting money to bank accounts they claim i controlled			1
@entity0 has spent 130 days in a @entity3 jail cell and is still waiting to be questioned by the authorities ‘ @entity8 bases most of its allegations against me on a report commissioned by them from a @entity81 - based accountant called @entity82			1
i have instructed internationally renowned accountancy and forensic investigators from @entity22 to examine what purport to be the findings of that report			2
‘ @entity22 ’s conclusions which i have now received are unequivocal			0
they say the @entity82 report on which the @entity8 allegations are based provides no evidence that i either created false invoices or diverted @entity8 money into accounts controlled by me			1
‘ the @entity22 conclusions also specifically state that there is no evidence provided to support any allegation “ that mr @entity0 created fake invoices to illegally divert funds for his own personal benefit from client / escrow accounts held on behalf of @entity8 by @entity68 ”			1
‘ both the handwriting report and the @entity22 findings confirm my belief that vindictive and personal attacks have been mounted against me in order to secure my incarceration in @entity3			0
indeed , it has already been admitted in court by @entity8 that they used subterfuge to lure me to @entity3 from the @entity112			2
‘ while i do not blame the @entity3 system or its authorities for what has happened , @entity8 knew full well that they had no grounds to have me detained in the @entity112			2
i have to remain confident that the @entity3 judicial system , which i believe to be fair and just , will do a thorough job which will result in my name being cleared			0
‘ in the meantime however i believe that @entity8 are exploiting the @entity3 system in having me locked up for more than four months without trial , never having been questioned about any criminality and guilty of no wrongdoing			2
justice will prevail ; of that i am confident			0
’ @entity0 ( right ) has enlisted the services of forensic investigators in a bid to clear his name @entity0 said he is now in danger of losing his home			1
‘ the freezing by @entity8 and @entity68 of my bank accounts and assets has prevented me from spending even a penny on my living expenses , such as food or medicine , ’ he said			2
‘ the @entity8 actions are also calculated to cause me maximum problems in @entity3 where debt is a criminal offence			2
in a few days my house may be foreclosed of which @entity8 are well aware			0
‘ i can only speculate as to motives for this conduct which , in taking away my freedom and seeking to destroy my reputation and character , is clearly in breach of my fundamental human rights			0
‘ can it be coincidence that the amounts of money @entity8 falsely claim was diverted illegally and deliberately into accounts controlled by me are remarkably similar to the amounts contained in my outstanding claims against @entity8 ? ‘ these include payments long overdue to me for expenses , salary , bonus shares and commission incurred during my time working both for @entity8 and as managing director of @entity1			1
‘ i have also volunteered to be transferred to a jail for long term serious drug offenders in order to have greater access to my lawyers			0
this is in spite of the serious and persistent health problems brought on by my imprisonment and the heavy medication which they have necessitated			0
‘ despite all this , @entity8 has shown no interest in engaging on these matters			0
they appear to me to be motivated by a strategy of seeking to discredit me by keeping me in jail without charge for as long as possible so that i can not defend myself			0
' at the same time they seek to gain maximum advantage from the fact i am unable properly to defend myself through my inability to access my phone , bank and computer records and files			0
this attempt to make me a scapegoat is cynical and wrong			0
