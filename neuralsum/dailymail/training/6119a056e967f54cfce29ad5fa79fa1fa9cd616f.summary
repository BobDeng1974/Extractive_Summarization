the shot can be clearly heard – followed by the veteran sergeant saying : ‘ shuffle off this mortal coil			2
’ a few seconds later he can be heard ordering his comrades : ‘ obviously this does n’t go anywhere , fellas			2
i ’ve just broken the @entity17			1
’ in the recording of the incident one soldier says : ' i 'll put one in his head if you want ' before a single gun shot can be heard , followed by groans from the insurgent , an unknown @entity6 national			1

it 's nothing you would n't do to us ' three marines , known only as @entity39 have been charged with murdering the man , who was lying in a field seriously injured after an @entity43 attack			1
they claim he was already dead when a shot was fired into his chest			2
a panel at a court martial in @entity61 , @entity62 , today retired to consider their verdicts in the case , after two weeks of evidence , but will now resume its deliberations tomorrow after reaching no verdict			0
audio : in a recording of the incident a soldier is heard saying ' it 's nothing you would n't do to us ' after the shot is fired into his chest case : the prosecution says a single gun shot was fired into the victim 's chest at this spot , and three men are currently on trial footage : the recording hears the group dragging the man 's injured body with the marines apparently joking about refusing to give first aid judge advocate general @entity92 has ruled graphic video footage - from which the audio was taken - must not be released			1
key : m / marine : unidentified speaker ? marine b : lower confidence in attribution ( @entity102 level confidence in words transcribed ) ... @entity105 speech end of recording			2
next video : end of recording ' its release may be for proper journalistic purposes ... but would also be used for sensationalist purposes by others and propaganda purposes by terrorist groups , ' he said			2
' more importantly its release will increase the threat of harm to @entity120 service personnel			0
' i am not prepared to make an order which may lead to the injury or death of a single member of the @entity120 armed forces and in making this decision i have erred on the side of safety			0
however , judge @entity92 permitted the release of certain still images from the video , which was captured on a camera worn by @entity134 the video footage shows the @entity7 patrol stood waiting outside a field of tall crops , with an @entity43 audible overhead			1
servicemen can be heard swearing and complaining about their task of carrying out a ' battle damage assessment ' after the @entity43 attack			2
during the trial , court martial heard the insurgent had been shot at with 139 30mm anti-tank rounds but was still alive - albeit seriously injured - when discovered by the patrol			0
one commando can be heard asking : ' why did n't they use a f * * * ing rocket ? ' , another replies ' f * * * me , it 's just error after error after error			1
' @entity39 and @entity158 are seen scouting out the field , locating the @entity6 before calling the others over			1
as @entity162 walks towards them , the camera captures its first shot of the seriously injured insurgent - lying on the ground , wearing a white dish - dash and covered in blood			1
the patrol drags the man across the field and into a wooded area nearby , throwing him to the ground			1
@entity174 is heard asking ' anybody want to do first aid on this idiot ? '			1
@entity162 is heard to loudly reply ' no '			1
@entity158 offers to shoot the man in the head , which is refused as @entity174 rules ' that would be f * * * * * * obvious '			1
the injured man , whose shirt had been pulled up his bloodied back , suffers kicks from the servicemen , who then flip him from back to front			0
@entity174 is seen walking forward , bending down , and shooting the man at close range in the centre of his chest with a 9mm pistol			1
giving evidence to the court martial , @entity174 insisted he believed the insurgent was dead at the time and he was simply shooting into a corpse in anger			1
after shooting the man , @entity174 is seen turning to the other members of the patrol and telling them ' obviously this does n't go anywhere fellas			1
' i just broke the @entity17			1
' * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * on the way back down to the @entity205 , it came over the @entity207 net that 2 more men they 'd tracked were up at compound 46 @entity211 , just @entity212 of us , and were about to get smashed by the ah			0
we went firm to watch / wait to see if we were needed and waited ... when the strike when in it was sound , @entity213 let loose with 30mm and the geezer got smashed			0
as he 'd been heading @entity217 at the time , across a field , we got tasked to carry out the @entity219 - since we were only around 500m away			0
so we headed up there , and as soon as we crossed into the field he was in , behind compound 13 , i pinged him			0
white dish dash , 50 meters @entity227 of the tree line we were moving up , in the middle of the field			0
* * * * was still moving ! 138 30mm rounds had n't finished him off			0
i expected him to be in bits ! so we drew level with him and went firm , then me and @entity174 moved out to him , covering each other a bound at a time , as the others provided our protection			1
he was down and hanging out but still moving , i said as much to @entity174 , as well as i had a headshot , but we cracked on up to him - i 'd expected to brass him up there and then , but i followed @entity174 's lead			1
we got to him , and he was in a very bad way , first we did the standard checks , @entity174 searched ... him , then jumped on him and rolled him over to check under him for any nasties			1
@entity247 had us in full view , as did @entity213 so @entity174 was playing it straight			2
we recovered an old hanging out @entity250 , with 2 mags , as well as a he grenade - sneaky * * * *			0
next he started assessing his wound , while i had my pistol drawn on his head in case he tried anything ; any excuse to pop him i would , piece of * * * *			0
i wanted to slot him bad , but @entity174 said no due to the @entity247 feed - goes direct live back to @entity264 , could wind me up on a murder charge			2
as i said before , he was * * * * * * up though his brain just had n't caught up with his body - he was dead , but he just did n't know it yet			0
the he / @entity269 rounds the ah use has fragged up his entire left side , head to toe , and he has 2 or 3 nasty ones up his back - having sucking chest wounds you could have fit 3 fingers in - his lungs and * * * * hanging out			0
i felt no pity for him though , * * * * had just been shooting up our boys at @entity280 and god knows what before that			0
so once we 'd searched and de-armed him , a couple of lads came over to drag him out of the middle of the fields , as we were mega exposed , and into the treeline ... everyone else was firm in			0
this also meant we were out of the watchful eye of the @entity247 balloon			0
initially @entity174 had sent up that this worthless piece of * * * * was alive , rightly or wrongly , but was n't keen to call a @entity294 out ; he was nearly dead anyway , do n't think he 'd of pulled through			1
now we were in cover , i was ready and waiting to pop him with a 9mm , one in the heart should do it , but i waited out for the nod from @entity174 , kept pressing the point and although for one minute i thought we were actually going to treat and casivac him , @entity174 squashed it and sent it up that he 'd snuffed it while we treated him			2
so there i was , pistol drawn , waiting for @entity174 to get off the net so i could pop this little * * * * and be done with it ; when @entity174 came back over , and thinned me out , to take up arcs with the others			2
as i walked off towards * * * * * * * * , @entity174 popped him one himself ! i felt mugged off , but job done , little * * * * was dead at the end of the day			2
we got some dna off him , then headed back in			0
i was pretty threaders ; not because i had n't got to finish him off myself , as he was dead either way , and i 'd have gained nothing from it , although i wanted to , maybe just for self satisfaction			0
i just felt a little mugged off			0
still end result was a good one = 1 x dead @entity318 * * * * bag , 1 x @entity250 , 2 x mags and 1 x grenade off the streets			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
