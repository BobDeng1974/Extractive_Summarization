by @entity0 published : 11:07 est , 28 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:56 est , 28 february 2014 it 's unusual for @entity4 to be playing catch up with its rivals , rather than leading the way , but its latest patent does just that			1
@entity4 has applied to add self - healing technology to its iphones and @entity12 , similar to the technology seen on @entity16 's @entity15 handset launched in october			1
it describes a coating that can be used anywhere on the device , filled with a material that flows into scratches and marks to make them disappear			2
@entity4 has filed a patent that details a number of techniques to stop its @entity27 and @entity12 screens getting scratched			2
these include a self - healing coating that flows and fills in scratches , a coating that is so slick , objects slide off it , and tiny , convex bumps moulded directly onto the glass to absorb scratches , pictured @entity4 's patent , published yesterday by the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) , is titled systems and methods for @entity40			1
it describes a coating that can be used anywhere on the device , filled with a material that flows into scratches and marks to make them disappear			2
the @entity46 tech giant explicit compares the coating to that seen in @entity50 firm @entity49 's @entity52 technology			1
@entity49 's coating is made from polymer - alloy that works in two ways - it makes the surface so slippery its difficult for scratches to mark it , referred to as the @entity58			1
it also has a trampoline effect which ' catches ' scratches by the coating 's chemical internal structure that acts ' like a spring , it splashes , and it returns it			0
' this coating could be as thin as 50 nanometers , according to the patent , and could also be used to stop scratches penetrating through lower layers of the phone			0
@entity4 's patent , published yesterday by the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) , is called @entity72			1
the @entity46 firm explicit compares the coating in the patent to that seen in @entity50 firm @entity49 's @entity52 technology			1
@entity49 's coating is made from polymer - alloy that works in two ways - it makes the surface so slippery its difficult for scratches to mark it , referred to as the @entity58			2
it also has a @entity60 which ' catches ' scratches using the coating 's chemical internal structure that acts ' like a spring , it splashes , and it returns it			0
' the self - healing coating is just one of the methods @entity4 wants to patent in order to stop its devices getting scratched or damaged			1
the first details a system where the casing of the phone or tablet is covered with a pattern of tiny , convex bumps moulded directly onto the glass panel to absorb scratches			0
the other involves a non-stick coating similar to that used by @entity49 to make the surface slicker so objects ' slide ' off it			2
@entity16 's @entity15 phone , pictured , was launched in october with a self - healing case			1
@entity50 firm @entity49 also makes a similar technology called @entity52			2
@entity49 's coating is made from polymer - alloy @entity4 has been heavily criticised in the past for its fragile devices			1
rumours in november claimed @entity4 's @entity27 6 , artist 's impression pictured , would have a screen made from sapphire glass			0
the technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin , hard - wearing and scratch resistant @entity4 has been heavily criticised in the past for its fragile devices and screens that easily smash			0
rumours in november claimed @entity4 's @entity27 would have a screen made from sapphire glass after the firm announced plans to open a mineral plant in @entity131 with sapphire glass experts @entity132			0
@entity4 already uses sapphire crystal in the @entity136 fingerprint scanner of its latest @entity137			0
@entity4 additionally protects the camera on the @entity27 with a small piece of this super-strong material			0
the technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin , hard - wearing and scratch resistant			0
as a result , sapphire glass could potentially replace @entity147 currently used in most high - end smartphones .			0

@entity4 's patent involves a self - healing coating for its iphones and @entity12
coating would flow into scratches and marks to make them disappear
this type of coating is used by @entity49 in its @entity52 *product*
@entity4 's proposed system is similar to the coating on @entity16 's @entity15 phone
