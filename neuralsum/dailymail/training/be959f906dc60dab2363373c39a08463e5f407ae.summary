by @entity0 published : 21:55 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 04:26 est , 16 october 2013 the new @entity2 appeal focused on a claim by an @entity5 family that they saw a man carrying a child through @entity9 at around the time @entity10 was found to be missing			1
two differing e-fits of the suspect were issued , and police say it is possible the family did see the three - year - old being spirited away by her abductor			2
the sighting came when @entity19 , a retired businessman in his 70s , was walking back to his apartment in the @entity23 resort following a meal and drinks at a bar with his wife and children			1
the @entity29 have issued this e-fit picture of a man who they believe may be connected with @entity10 's disappearance at a spot a six - minute walk from the @entity36 ’ holiday accommodation , they saw a man carrying a blonde child aged around four			1
it was just before 10pm and the street lighting was poor			0
although mr @entity19 admitted he was not wearing his glasses at the time he later said he thought the man could have been @entity47			1
this is an impossibility as dozens of witnesses confirmed he was at the holiday complex at 10pm			0
@entity52 police have also said they are certain that mr @entity47 has nothing to do with his daughter ’s appearance			2
speaking to @entity57 police a few weeks after @entity58 disappeared , mr @entity19 said it was ‘ not possible to recognise the individual ’			0
his grandchildren were also unable to identify the man or the girl – but thought she could have been @entity65			2
yet in september 2007 mr @entity19 suddenly called police again to say he believed the man he saw could have been @entity47			1
he had been watching television coverage of the family returning to @entity52			0
however numerous witnesses say they were with mr @entity47 at the tapas restaurant at the time in question – so he could not possibly have been 500 yards away			2
this has led to mr @entity19 ’s account being called into question			0
the retired businessman from @entity77 , @entity78 , was staying in @entity9 with his wife @entity79 , now 65 , his son @entity80 and his wife and their children			1
he part owned an apartment in the resort and visited it three times a year			0
fresh leads : @entity52 police are chasing new leads in the investigation into the disappearance of @entity10 after being swamped by almost 1,000 tip - offs			0

could @entity5 family have witnessed *toddler* being snatched ?
retired businessman saw man carrying blonde child
thought at the time it was @entity47 , but *proved* to be elsewhere
