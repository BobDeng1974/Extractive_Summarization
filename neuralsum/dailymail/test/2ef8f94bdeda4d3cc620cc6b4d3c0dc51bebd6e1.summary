@entity1 's bitter ex-husband tried to derail her appointment to a diplomatic post by calling her ' emotionally unstable ' during her @entity5 background check @entity6 told an agent in 1969 to think twice because @entity8 would ' overreact if she did n't get her way '			1
he also said that her mother had wrecked their marriage because she interfered in their affairs too much			0
his efforts were unsuccessful as dozens of other people including @entity17 came to @entity8 's defense and called her a ' very courageous woman of the highest morals '			1
the couple married when she was 17 and were photographed ( above ) two years later the claims were revealed in @entity5 files obtained by @entity49 through @entity51 requests			1
@entity8 was a child star whose career began at three ; she became the biggest actress in @entity27 in the 1930s and raked in an unheard of $ 50,000 a film after the success of movies like @entity34 and @entity35			1
her career ran until she was 22 at which point she began doing charity work and became well known for her @entity29 views , running unsuccessfully for a @entity65 seat in @entity66 in 1967			1
in 1969 president @entity45 wanted to appoint her to the post of @entity27 representative to the @entity69 so the @entity5 carried out a full background check , which included everything from her credit history to interviews with former teachers			1
among those the agents spoke to was @entity6 , @entity8 's first husband who she married at 17 and divorced in 1950 at the age of 22 after they had a daughter together			1
her divorce petition said that @entity8 had endured ' grievous mental suffering ' and that @entity6 had subjected her to ' extreme cruelty '			2
when the @entity5 agent came to speak with @entity6 , the file states he told them that he had not been in contact with his ex-wife at all since they split up two decades before			1
the report states : ' he further stated that during his marriage her mother interfered with their affairs , which caused part of their marital problems			0
' he advised he would hesitate to recommend [ her ] for a position of trust and confidence in the federal government as , during their marriage , he considered her emotionally unstable in that she had a tendency to ' overreact ' if she did not get her way '			0
@entity6 did however say there was ' no question ' over her integrity or her associates			2

@entity5 background reports said that they had a strong marriage and that she was a committed patriot rescuer : @entity17 had appeared alongside @entity1 in @entity128 in 1947			1
he was @entity66 's governor when he and others endorsed her for office during @entity5 background checks , unlike her ex-husband he said that he had the ' utmost trust and confidence ' in her abilities and that he considers her ' loyalty , morals , character , reputation and associates to be beyond reproach '			1
the report said : ' he said he had never heard anything derogatory about ( @entity8 ) and he highly recommended her for a position of trust and responsibility in the @entity27 government '			0
the picture from other people who were interviewed by the @entity5 was generally positive , with a few reservations			2
sheriff @entity151 of @entity152 in @entity66 , where @entity8 was living at the time , said that her ' loyalty to this country is completely unquestioned '			2
however @entity155 , who got to know @entity8 when she was running for @entity156 , said that she was ' somewhat naive in her acceptance of people and organisations '			0
she also claimed that @entity8 was ' aloof ' and that she had been accused of ' snobbery ' because she does n't have a good memory for names and faces			0
@entity155 also claimed that @entity8 was ' not a deep thinker ' and needs a good team around her to function well			0
another female @entity29 advisor who was spoken to says that @entity8 ' can not stand the flak of controversy ' whilst a second said that she is ' easily directed '			2
a former district office manager for @entity66 representative @entity171 , whose name has been redacted , says that he had a ' personal like for [ her ] and felt she was completely sincere in what she does '			2

the files praised their family life and said the manager of their country club ' considers the @entity194 to be one of the finest families she has ever known ' there			0
but he also felt that @entity8 ' did not have the intellectual background for the job she was seeking '			0
the @entity5 file is very much a product of its time and calls @entity8 an ' unemployed housewife except when she worked as an actress '			1
an account of an interview with the manager of the @entity209 , whose name has been redacted , suggesting she is still alive , said : ' she stated she considers the @entity194 to be one of the finest families that she has ever known at the club and described the black children as very fine , strictly raised children			0
' a summary document of interviews prepared by @entity5 agent @entity217 reveals that some of those spoken to thought she was ' not outstanding in administrative matters '			2
the file claims that @entity8 and @entity5 director @entity177 were friends and says that agents were not to conduct neighborhood surveillance on her ' unless the need arises ' , and only with approval of their superiors at the bureau			1
@entity8 was appointed to the post but only held it from september until december 1969			0

the @entity5 carried out more checks on her past and approached future president @entity241 , who was chairman of the @entity242 at the time , to give his view of her			2
