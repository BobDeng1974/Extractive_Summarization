by @entity0 last updated at 3:57 am on 7th january 2012 @entity2 paleontologist @entity1 has found tranquillityite , a mineral thought to be unique to the moon , in billion - year - old rocks in @entity6			0
when the @entity9 astronauts returned to @entity10 , they brought back three minerals - armalcolite , pyroxferroite , and tranquillityite , named after the @entity14 , where astronauts landed in 1969			1
the first two were subsequently found on @entity10 - but the third , tranquillityite was thought to be the ' moon 's own mineral '			2
a mineral brought back to @entity10 by the first men on the @entity22 and long thought to be unique to the lunar surface has been found in @entity2 rocks more than one billion years old , scientists say the northeast @entity26 region of @entity6 where the dolerite containing the ' moon mineral ' tranquillityite has been discovered thin slices of the dolerite which contains tranquillityite - a mineral thought to be unique to the moon , but is now thought to be ' widespread ' in a paper published this week , @entity1 reveals that the mineral is present in six sites in @entity6 - and might be ' widespread			1
' @entity1 told the @entity37 , ' this was essentially the last mineral which was sort of uniquely lunar that had been found in the 70s from these samples returned from the @entity9 mission			1
' ' the mineral has since been found exclusively in returned lunar samples and lunar meteorites , with no terrestrial counterpart			0
we have now identified tranquillityite in six sites from @entity6			0
' @entity1 says that it 's proof these minerals were ' always ' part of the @entity10 - and that similar chemical processes are at work on earth and on the moon			1
' this means that basically we have the same chemical phenomena on the @entity22 and on @entity10			2
' in a paper published in the journal @entity61 , @entity1 says that he analysed moon rocks , then looked for the mineral in samples from @entity10			0
he said that the reason no one had found it was that , ' no one was looking hard enough			0

last of three minerals brought back by @entity9 mission in 1969
may be ' widespread ' on @entity10
proof that @entity10 and the moon share the same chemical processes
