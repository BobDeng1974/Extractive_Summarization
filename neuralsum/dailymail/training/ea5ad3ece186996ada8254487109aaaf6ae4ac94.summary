while they were resting in a tent attached half - way up the rock - face , four terrorists from the @entity38 , a group linked to @entity39 , began spraying them with bullets			1

six days of hell followed as the gunmen moved them from place to place , with little food or water			1

and i was basically curled up in a ball			0
i had totally broken down			0
and they were trying to comfort me			0
they were saying how i 'd just saved their lives			0
it was helping , but i still could n't believe that i had just done that			0

@entity1 and @entity19 , both from the @entity117 , completed the ascent of @entity3 , one of @entity4 's most iconic features , on wednesday			1
it was a feat deemed impossible by many			2
they called their 19 - day taming of the sheer 900 - meter ( 2,950 - feet ) rock face in @entity126 a ' spiritual experience			1
' the iconic rock formation @entity3 in @entity126 , @entity4 the two made the journey up the previously untraversed @entity131 , a sheer granite rock face on the massive formation considered one of the most difficult free climbs in the world			1
' it felt like a very spiritual experience the whole time , even now it feels a bit surreal to me , ' @entity1 told reporters following the climb			1
@entity19 added : ' when you would grab that last hole you could literally feel all of the hope , desire and stress drop off of you			0
' free climbing involves climbing with only the hands and feet			2
the only ropes are fixed from below as a safety precaution			0
the two had trained for years and planned their climb months in advance , carefully studying their route up the @entity24			0
during the journey @entity1 and @entity19 slept in small tents affixed to the rock face and climbed up the ropes to where they had left off for a new day of climbing			1
' i think that the camaraderie that we had was crucial , ' @entity1 said			1
as the two neared the end of their journey , they attracted international attention for the incredible feat. people watch as the two climbers ascend the ' @entity24 ' in this december 28 , 2014 , photo provided by @entity176 , @entity1 ascends what is known as pitch 10 of @entity3 @entity3 rises more than 3,000 feet above the @entity180 floor			1
the first climber reached its summit in 1958 , and there are roughly 100 routes up to the top @entity19 grips the surface of a razor - sharp edge as he makes his way up the 3000ft @entity3 the climb took a grueling 19 days and the climbers kept the public up to date with their progress using social media dozens of news outlets covered the finale of the climb when @entity19 and @entity1 were greeted by friends and sprayed with champagne			1
@entity117 president @entity202 tweeted words of congratulations with a photo of himself in front of a painting of the notable rock face			2
' you remind us that anything is possible , ' @entity202 wrote			0
the critical moment for @entity19 came at the beginning of the month about half way up the free climb			0
their climbing was divided into sections or ' pitches ' between which their safety ropes were strung			2
on pitch 15 , @entity19 reached an impasse			0
the taller climber needed to reach out with his full armspan , and hold with just two fingers of one hand to pull himself to the next hold and finish the pitch			2
determined : @entity1 , top , climbs @entity230 with @entity19 handling the line @entity1 , center , standing with a photographer at a base camp before climbing a half - mile section of exposed granite in @entity4 's @entity126 rock on : @entity1 and @entity19 set up camp as they begin their epic climb president @entity202 posted this photo on @entity242 congratulating the men in front of @entity246 painting of @entity3 but his fingers , worn down after days of climbing in the cold winter nights , were cracked and cut and he could n't reach the hold the slighter @entity1 had already completed			1
giving up crossed @entity19 's mind , and he considered telling @entity250 to continue ahead without him			2
' the idea of topping out without @entity19 was something i did n't want to think about , ' @entity1 told reporters			1
fortunately , the weather stayed cold and dry , best for climbing because of the friction , and @entity1 said they would stay as long as they needed until @entity19 could make the spread - eagle move			1
@entity19 had the film crew following him splice together all his failures on pitch 15			0
he studied his mistakes , corrected his technique and made the difficult grab			0
' everything really had to come together for that to work out , ' he said reflecting on the moment			0
' you are just hanging there in silence and relief and joy and it 's like the coolest feeling			2
' @entity3 : the courageous pair closing in on the top of the 3,000 - foot peak the world was watching as the pair 's grueling half - mile journey up the peak 's @entity131 route ended with an emotional reunion with their families at the summit in @entity126			1
