@entity0 has been removed from @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity3 after deacons voted *unanimously* to oust him
only 50 members showed up on sunday for a service that usually hosts about 160
in a sermon in september , he revealed he had contracted @entity8 in 2003 and was diagnosed with @entity125 in 2008 - and the congregation was supportive
but in later sermons he revealed he had taken cocaine , misused church funds and had sex with members of the congregation in the church
he knew he had @entity125 at the time but it is not clear if he told all of the women he had the disease ; at least one said she is getting checked
