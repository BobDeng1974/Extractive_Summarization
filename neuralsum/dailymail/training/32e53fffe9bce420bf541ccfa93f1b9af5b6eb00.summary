by @entity0 published : 02:39 est , 24 september 2012 updated : 09:31 est , 24 september 2012 a ' nervous , happy and desperate to get on with it ' @entity1 made his debut as the new host of the @entity5 today			1
the @entity7 - native , 28 , took to the microphone at 6.30am for his first day , kicking off the show with @entity10 and @entity12 's duet n * * * * * in @entity13			0
before his first track , @entity1 introduced himself : ' so this is happening , it 's actually happening			2
@entity18 , i 'm @entity1			2
i 'm nervous , happy and desperate to get on with it			0
' it 's time to start the difficult job of talking between records			0
i 've been dreaming about this since i was a little boy			0
' @entity1 's appointment in the role comes after previous breakfast show host @entity25 left following eight and half years			1
@entity1 himself had previously hosted a late night show before his new role was announced in july			1
support : fellow @entity42 ( @entity43 ) @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 came to visit although @entity1 played the radio edit of the foul - mouthed @entity12 and @entity10 track , he joked if he had played the unedited version it would have been ' the world 's shortest stint on the radio 1 breakfast show - three and a half minutes '			1
among the celebrity guests on the show were his good friend @entity57 , who talked about @entity59 's new video and album on the phone , and a pre-recorded interview with @entity63			0
@entity1 ended up teasing a mumbling @entity57 by playing a brief bit of the wrong track instead of @entity59 's new song @entity64 , joking : ' sorry , my finger slipped			2
' after fellow @entity71 @entity45 later noted @entity57 did n't sound too happy by @entity1 's ' slip - up ' , the new breakfast show host replied : ' after he said @entity5 instead of @entity73 by mistake at the @entity75 , he needs us - where else is he going to go ? " oh i ’m just popping into @entity78 " – i do n’t think so ! ' time to get up ! @entity1 was greeted by people in chicken costumes for his first morning on the @entity5 ahead of his arrival at the @entity5 studios in central @entity83 , @entity1 was greeted outside the building by two people in chicken costumes , who gave him a year 's supply of @entity89 coffee to help him get up in the morning			1
speaking to @entity5 ’s @entity90 after the show , he said : “ it feels weird , i feel a relief now , the first day is done and it was the first show			2
obviously a lot of people were waiting to hear it and there was a lot of anticipation of what the show would sound like , so yes it ’s good to get the first one done			0
' today i guess was a lot like an introduction and repeating myself , saying my name a lot			0
tomorrow i can do a more regular show and tell a few more stories			0
' on his own : @entity1 is the main star of the show , in contrast to @entity25 's ' zoo ' format ' in between the celeb guests , @entity1 was funny , cool , collected , and played actual - gasp - music			1
' now magazine ' @entity1 ’s first show was fast - paced , full of celebrity banter and , most importantly , fun			1
' @entity119 ' a promising start – and a clear break from what went before			0
it was out with dad rock , cynicism and bloatedly self - indulgent banter ; in with dance beats , youthful energy and enthusiasm for new music ... the show has swapped one who prefers music to the sound of his own voice ; one much more in touch with its target audience of teens and twentysomethings			2
' @entity140 ' the message in the opening show – which was a likeable mix of music , self - deprecating chat , interaction on social media , interviews , silly features and funny , often quite bitchy quips – was that the power here has shifted and lies squarely in the music ... a very promising , refreshing start that politely suggested the over- 30s might like to retune			2
' @entity154 the @entity157 presenter 's new role on the breakfast show is a bid to lower @entity5 's demographic after a report by the @entity162 found the station needed to work harder to attract younger listeners			2
in research published last november , it was claimed the average @entity5 listener was 32 and went up to 33 for 38 - year - old @entity25 ' breakfast show			1
in a bid to attract younger listeners , the music policy seems a lot younger , with a heavier dance influence than had been broadcast on @entity25 ' show			1
@entity1 will aim to play between eight to 10 songs an hour - double the amount played on @entity25 ' show			1
instead of @entity25 ' ' zoo ' format of his production team , the @entity178 show will mostly feature his voice with more phone - ins from the audience			1
@entity1 previously admitted he had problems getting up in the morning and told his listeners he had bought a wake - up light that gradually uses light and bird song to wake him up gently in the morning			0
showing there was no hard feelings , @entity25 actually sent a good luck gift to @entity1 , who read out the card live on air : ' good luck with the new show , enjoy it see you soon , from @entity25 , former owner of the breakfast show			1
' @entity1 told his listeners : ' ahh ! i texted him on holiday and said " thank you for being nice to me in the paper			0
" ' @entity25 replied , " you 'll be great , but not as great as me			0
" ' and now he 's sent me some cakes , thank you @entity205 , very nice			0
and weird to not listen to him in the morning ! i used to be able to tell how late i was based on which feature			0
' friendly face : @entity1 's close friend @entity209 and her dog paid a visit to the @entity5 studios one of his biggest cheerleaders was close friend @entity209 , who woke up early to listen to her pal , before heading in to visit him at the studio at the end of his shift			1
she wrote on @entity218 : ' up early for @ grimmers ! ! ! ! ! so proud ! ! ! @entity221 music at the beginning of the radio one breakfast show with @entity1 ! ' @ grimmers obsessed with when they say " radio 1 breakfast show with nick grimshaw " so emo			1
' among those to give him praise were veteran dj @entity232 , who presented the @entity234 morning show from 1987 - 1993			0
@entity232 tweeted : ' @entity1 sounding a lot less terrified and a lot more organised than i did			0
' end of an era : @entity25 and his team ( @entity43 ) @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity90 , @entity242 , @entity243 and @entity244 on their last show on september 14 video : move over @entity25 ! @entity1 takes over			1

new show has less talk , more music than *forerunner* @entity25
show just features @entity1 in the studio , as apposed to @entity25 ' zoo ' full of sidekicks
*critics* heap praise on the ' cool ' and ' fun ' host for bringing @entity5 back to the youth
