fury : @entity1 revealed on @entity2 that her thrifty mother - in - law had been denied a mobile phone contract because she has no credit history as a business owner who has never been in debt , @entity1 ’s mother - in - law should have found buying a new mobile phone to be a simple procedure			2
but 85 - year - old @entity11 was turned down for a contract – because she does not have a credit rating			1
mrs @entity11 – who is mother to miss @entity1 ’s partner of ten years , @entity14 , 55 – employs three people in her antiques shop in @entity17 , @entity18 , and has had a bank account for 60 years			1
but because she has never borrowed money and appears to have chosen not to pay her utility bills by direct debit , she does not have a credit history and was told by @entity24 that she could not purchase a phone and contract with @entity26			1
financial experts warned that her situation – which @entity29 , 43 , revealed on @entity2 – reflects a wider problem that affects thousands of thrifty elderly people who handle their money in a similar way			2

the television presenter added : ‘ they came back and said she had n’t got a good credit rating and my mother - in - law was like “ how on earth can i have a not good credit rating ? i ’ve never had a debt in my life ”			1
and that ’s when they said yes , that ’s why			0
’ @entity47 , founder of @entity48 , said : ‘ if this woman is being prudent and has n’t built up a credit history then she should n’t be penalised for that			0
‘ there is still a significant part of the elderly community who like to go to the post office and pay their bills			0
they do n’t like to have direct debits because they feel they have better control of their cashflow that way			0
’ a spokesman for @entity24 said : ‘ there can be a number of reasons why customers fail their initial credit check … we are working with @entity26 to investigate this matter to try to resolve the issue for the customer			0
