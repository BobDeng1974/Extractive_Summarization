@entity56 , the leader of the @entity57 , said the group hopes to meet with president @entity59 to discuss their demands			0
@entity56 said there are 452 badly injured migrants from @entity3 alone , and more from other @entity16 countries			1
' we have hit bottom ... it is no longer even news when two people die on ' @entity69 , ' or that somebody fell under the train and lost his legs , ' @entity56 said , referring to the train that travels through southern @entity8 that migrants call @entity75			2
victims : @entity77 , 50 , ( left ) @entity78 , 41 , ( right ) are both migrants from @entity3 who use prosthetic legs after falling from trains travelling through @entity8 toward the @entity11 border travel : they badly inured migrants expressed hope that @entity8 would agree to allow them transit visas or free passage without documents to cross the country on their way to the @entity11 border criminal gangs often board the trains to rob migrants , many of whom have relatives in the @entity11			1
they are sometimes kidnapped and held until their families send ransom payments			0
the migrants are often afraid to report such crimes for fear they will be deported , and some accuse police in @entity8 of turning detained migrants over to the gangs , or robbing them themselves			2
@entity56 said migrants believe that railway employees work with criminal gangs by slowing down to allow them to board the trains			2
' there is a plot that involves the engineers and the railway guards , it 's all about extorting money from the migrants , he said			0
a criminal complaint filed last week by prosecutors in the southern @entity8 state of @entity120 alleges that railway companies or their employees have been complicit in crimes committed against migrants riding their trains			2
@entity126 , a @entity8 rail line , and @entity128 , a subsidiary of the @entity11 railway @entity129 , noted that migrants board their trains illegally , and said they were doing everything to cooperate with authorities			1
' the guidelines of @entity128 state that security personnel must respect the physical safety of those who travel illegally on the trains , " the company said in a statement			0
@entity126 said it ' provided full cooperation ' with @entity8 immigration agents			0
but @entity56 said immigration agents should n't be pursuing migrants who do n't want to stay in @entity8 and only wish to reach the @entity11			1

being an undocumented migrant is now a minor offense punishable by fines , although most migrants are been deported			0
rather than deportation , @entity56 's group is calling on @entity8 to provide transit visas to guarantee safe passage of central @entity11 migrants through the country - something that @entity8 congresswoman @entity178 claims is possible , albeit with a few legal changes			1
@entity56 also said migrants want federal police officers aboard the trains - not to catch migrants , but to protect them from criminals			0
he also expressed hope that @entity8 's government would help support migrant shelters , most of them run by @entity192 relief and charity organizations			0
uch shelters could have made the difference for @entity56 , who lost an arm , a leg and part of his other hand when he fainted and fell on the tracks in the northern state of chihuahua in 2005 after 20 days of riding the train , not eating and hiding from police			0
senator @entity203 , who met with the migrants , said that @entity8 should give migrants the same kind of protections it demands from the @entity11 when @entity8 are deported			1
