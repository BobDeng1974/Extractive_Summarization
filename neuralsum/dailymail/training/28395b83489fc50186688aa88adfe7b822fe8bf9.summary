amazingly , the interior is much larger than its exterior , which looks like an old @entity33 police box			0
the tardis is in some respects alive			0

the tardis can translate speech and writing for people travelling inside it , enabling them to understand any alien language even once they step outside most tardis can use their chameleon circuit to change appearance			1
but , the doctor - who was recently played by @entity59 ( pictured ) - has a broken tardis which is stuck in the form of an old @entity33 police box unfortunately , @entity7 only gives you a sneak peek of the inside the interior			1
you can see a maze of endless corridors , but the map does n’t allow you to go down into the libraries , art galleries and swimming pools			2
a @entity7 spokesperson said : ' inspired by the 50th anniversary of @entity75 , our engineers thought it would be a cool idea for users to find and tour the tardis from @entity6 level			1
' so far fans have left 375 reviews of the venue			2
stayed here ages ago - always had a handy supply of jelly babies on the pillow , ’ said one review			2
‘ they must have had a pest problem , though - i kept hearing someone shouting " exterminate ! exterminate ! ” ’ you can see a maze of endless corridors , but the map does n't allow you to go down into the libraries , art galleries and swimming pools another commented : ‘ a lovely and spacious residence			1
the excursion trips are out of this world , literally			0
’ @entity7 is known for adding semi-secret bonus features known as ‘ @entity102 ’			1
for instance , typing ‘ do a barrel roll ’ into its search engine will see results spin around the screen			2
others features in the past have included putting ninjas in its reader and spam recipes in its @entity115 spam folders			0
last year , @entity116 in @entity117 created his own @entity118 which was larger on the inside , thanks to the nifty use of augmented reality ( @entity123 )			2
he created it over a few hours using wood , two bottles and some dark blue paint , before fixing a working red light on the top			0
' then my stupid brain went and thought ' hey would n't it be cool if it had an interior , ' mr @entity116 wrote on his blog			0
but how to defy the laws of physics and make it bigger on the inside ? first he created a @entity141 computer model of the interior using a free - to - use open source computer software programme called @entity144			1
the former @entity146 mobile editor then used the unity graphics rendering engine			0
rendering is the process of generating a 2d image from a 3d model stored in a scene file by using a computer program			0
this information describes the geometry , viewpoint , texture , lighting and shading of the virtual scene			0
finally he used an @entity123 app platform by chip - maker @entity163 called @entity164 , to allow a smartphone to interact with the mini @entity118 .			2

@entity7 is allowing anyone to take a look inside using its @entity6 map
it added the feature to *celebrate* the 50th anniversary of @entity75
