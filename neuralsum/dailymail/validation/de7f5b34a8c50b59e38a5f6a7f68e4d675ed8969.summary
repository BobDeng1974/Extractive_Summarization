@entity0 took radical steps to transform @entity3 ’s season as he feared a failure to do so would leave him in danger of being sacked			1
@entity3 ’s fortunes have transformed since @entity0 drastically switched his side ’s system to an attack - minded 3 - 4 - 3 formation in december ; they are the form team in the @entity11 , having taken 27 points from the last 33			1
the memory of how bad things were in november , though , has not left @entity0 and he has admitted that his experience at @entity16 , when he was axed in december 2009 after just 20 matches in charge , triggered his decision to rip things up and start again			1
@entity3 manager @entity0 speaks to his coaches during a training session at @entity23 the former @entity25 manager shares a joke with @entity28 defender @entity27 in training @entity0 chats to @entity32 full back @entity30 during the training session at @entity23 @entity0 is highly - regarded by @entity33 , @entity3 ’s owners , and he signed a new long - term contract last may but the 42 - year - old knows none of that would have mattered had his side ’s results continued on a downward spiral			1
‘ i certainly was n’t going to roll over and die , ’ said @entity0 , whose side face @entity42 on wednesday			1
‘ i love it here and i want to be successful			2

‘ it could not go on , really			2
my experience at @entity16 told me that			1
that ’s what i learned from that sacking			0
i went in with the full backing of the chairman , who was great to me			0
even though it was a three - year project and they wanted me there , i got the sack after 20 games			0
‘ i learnt that it does not matter how much support you have in the boardroom , you have to get results – and you have to win			2

he needed to lift himself as much as his players			0
‘ we had a huge challenge , probably the biggest i have had as a coach or manager , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ we had no identity and everyone could see it			0
