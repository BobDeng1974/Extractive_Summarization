by @entity1 reporter published : 17:09 est , 28 february 2014 @entity3 : 17:10 est , 28 february 2014 emergency responders closest to the mountain where a 21 - year - old student was swept up in a deadly @entity9 avalanche were never dispatched to the scene , it has emerged			1
@entity11 , a @entity12 student from @entity13 , was snow - shoeing and tubing with friends at @entity17 in @entity18 on february 8 when the group upset the snow , sparking an avalanche that carried @entity11 down the mountainside			1
the slide swept @entity11 into a stream where she was held underwater and covered in snow until her friends dug her out 20 minutes later			1
a witness drove from the mountain to get cell service to call 911			1
but once 911 was contacted , dispatchers failed to send the nearest team - causing a delay in reaching @entity11 and depriving her of precious minutes of oxygen , the @entity30 reported			1
killed : @entity11 , 21 , was caught in an avalanche and trapped under snow for at least 20 minutes before she was found			1
records suggest that the nearest emergency crew to her was not dispatched ' this ca n't happen again , ' @entity40 fire chief @entity39 told the paper			1
we 're in the business of saving lives			0
' the avalanche took places at 5.28pm and scooped up four of the group , although three managed to get free			2
a man who had been sledding nearby was asked to call 911 for help			2
' it 's @entity53 , ' he told the @entity54 at 5.40pm			0
' there 's an avalanche			2
we 've lost someone there			0
' three deputies with the @entity61 were dispatched from different locations three minutes later and dispatchers repeatedly tried to get through to the sheriff 's search and rescue team			1
but just two minutes away from the canyon were @entity40 paramedics and firefighters who were ready to go - they just did n't receive a call			2
ten minutes after the initial call , the team were paged and told to call the dispatchers , who then said that other emergency services were on their way			1
scene : the group were walking near @entity17 when they disturbed the snow on february 8 ' do you want us to head up that direction ? ' a firefighter asked the dispatcher , records show			1
' that 's up to you , ' the dispatcher replied			0
' we 're just giving you a heads - up at this time ' cause we do n't have any , you know , confirmation or anything yet			0
we 've got deputies en route			0
' anger : fire chief @entity39 said he had to dispatch his own team - the nearest to the scene the fire chief , @entity39 , decided to send his team			1
he told the @entity30 : ' we were never dispatched			0
we had to self - dispatch on this call			0
' what stands out the most is kind of how nonchalant the call ( dispatcher ) was and leaving it up to us			0
' i 'm not saying it was n't taken seriously , but we should have been dispatched immediately			0
i mean , this is a critical call the way the caller called it in			0
' a police officer nearest to the scene reached the group at 5.58pm , where he learned that @entity11 had just been found face down in three feet of water			1
the @entity40 ambulance arrived at 6.06pm , about 26 minutes after the 911 call was made and about 20 minutes after she was found			1
@entity11 was taken to @entity121 but she was taken off life support the next day			2
@entity39 said he does not know if the 10 - minute delay in his team reaching the scene could have saved her life , but it would have given her more oxygen			1
' i ca n't say she would be alive today , ' he said			0
' but her chances would be a lot better ... this can not happen again			0
' loss : @entity11 was rushed to hospital nearly half an hour after the avalanche and died the following day no hope : staff at the @entity121 were able to revive @entity11 but her life support was switched off the next day			1
@entity39 said if they had got there earlier , she might have had a chance @entity39 said he will be investigating further , while @entity54 said a review of the incident was being conducted			0
@entity144 's sgt. @entity143 said the avalanche that struck @entity11 was short and narrow , extending about 80 yards on a steep hill			1
' it was n't a big one - it was just enough to get caught up in it , ' he said			2
the @entity149 issued a red - level advisory for the day of the tragedy , and reported several natural - occurring slides throughout the day along the @entity153			2
around 4 p.m. , the @entity149 reported that slide danger had become extreme			0
