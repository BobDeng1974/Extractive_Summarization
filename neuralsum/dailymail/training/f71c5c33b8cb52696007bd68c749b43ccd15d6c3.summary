by @entity0 published : 11:57 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 06:11 est , 27 november 2012 a @entity2 father has received a life - saving kidney from his cousin in @entity5 - after he wrote about his plight on @entity7			1
@entity8 , 42 , from @entity9 , and @entity10 , 44 , are now recovering in hospital after undergoing the major transplant surgery			1
@entity10 had been documenting his struggle with polycystic kidney disease on @entity7 and used an app to update his status and treatments			1
@entity8 ( left ) from @entity9 , @entity5 , has donated a kidney to his cousin @entity10 after hearing about his plight on @entity7 @entity8 - who had only met his first cousin twice before - spotted @entity10 was using the app to regularly check - in to hospital and realised he was on dialysis			1
@entity8 , who works in advertising , got in touch and offered his organ for the transplant			1
the cousins then met for the first time in 33 years when john flew over in june to see if he was a suitable match for the operation			0
thankfully he was , and the three - hour transplant op has now gone ahead at @entity34 in @entity35			0
speaking today , @entity10 , of @entity36 , @entity37 , said : ' we did n’t actually know each other that well , having grown up on different sides of the @entity41 , but we became friends on @entity7 a couple of years ago			1
' @entity8 saw that i was in need of a new kidney , and offered to be a living donor			1
the operation took place at @entity34 , @entity35 , after @entity8 travelled to the @entity2 the operation is said to have gone well and the donated kidney has been transferred successfully ' it ’s one of those things where it ’s difficult to find the words			1
it ’s a mixture of gratitude and just thankfulness that he ’s come forward to help			0
' i know from my previous transplant the difference it makes to me having a healthy working kidney			2
' @entity8 said he had been moved to help after seeing pictures of @entity10 with his three - year - old daughter @entity65			1
speaking from his hospital bed , he said : ' as expected i ’m a little sore , but in good spirits , i ’m glad i did it			0
' @entity10 looks great , he has some recovery to do but he ’ll be in tip top shape before long			2
i ’m confident i will recover properly			0
@entity10 said : ' i am increasingly realising that an organ donation has a much wider impact than just for the recipient			2
it 's also about the lives of their families and the people around them			0
it really is a tremendous gift			0
' ' i feel it has been very worthwhile and the benefits far outweigh the risks			0
it was something i felt i wanted to do because he ’s family			0
' in the grand scheme of things it does n’t feel like a sacrifice			0
i have two young daughters , and i know what energy it takes to look after them			0
' i wanted to be able to help @entity10 get a new lease of life , not just for himself , but for his family , and his daughter in particular			2
' by monitoring @entity10 ’s situation - seeing his updates and seeing him check into certain health clinics during his dialysis i felt a connection between the two			1
' it was just a feeling in me that told me it was something i should do			0
' @entity10 , a musician , was forced to have dialysis every day after a donated kidney failed in 2011			1
his condition is a hereditary disease which his mother , who also went on dialysis , also suffered from			2
he was diagnosed at 21 but only started showing symptoms in his 30s and finally went on dialysis at 38			0
father - of - one @entity10 started using phone app ‘ @entity110 ’ on his iphone in december which allows users to check - in to visited places			1
@entity10 said he was playing around with the app while at hospital one day which alerted his @entity7 friends , including his cousin @entity8 , that he was on dialysis again			1
family matters : @entity5 cousin @entity8 is 3rd from left ( in yellow ) while @entity10 is on his right			1
@entity10 's dad @entity122 is standing with baby on back , while @entity8 's day is standing far right dr @entity126 , who completed the keyhole surgery , known as nephrectomy , described it as ' complex '			1
he said : ' this is a complex surgery , you need to handle the kidney very carefully because it is being used for transplantation			0
' the donors are very precious , like any other patient , but particularly because they are people who are putting themselves through surgery to make someone else better			0
' @entity8 ’s dad , also called @entity8 , was brother of @entity10 ’s father @entity122 and were two of four brothers who grew up in @entity143 , @entity144			1
during the early 1960s , @entity8 got married to @entity145 who said a condition of their marriage was to move abroad to get away from her mother			2
family tree : the @entity10 brothers , ( @entity154 ) @entity8 ( @entity5 @entity8 's father ) @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity122 ( @entity10 's father ) grew up in @entity143 @entity8 and @entity145 moved to @entity159 where @entity10 ’s cousin , @entity8 , who was one of four children , was born in 1970			1
the cousins first met when @entity10 , then aged 11 , and his family went to stay in @entity159 with @entity8 , then aged nine , and his family in 1979			1
@entity8 later moved to @entity5 with his family in 1981 where he has stayed ever since			2
the pair did not have any contact for more than 20 years until 2003 , when they met at @entity10 ’s uncle and @entity8 ’s father ’s second wedding - but the pair only spoke briefly			1
around two years ago they befriended each other on @entity7 and used the social networking site to send messages and view each other ’s photographs			2
@entity10 , married to @entity178 , 42 , said : ' i am increasingly realising that an organ donation has a much wider impact than just for the recipient			2
' it ’s also about the lives of their families and the people around them			0
it really is a tremendous gift			0
' i guess blood is thicker than water but i know he ’s also done it because of my daughter			0
' transplant surgeon @entity194 said : “ it ’s pretty amazing that , at the start of the process , this kidney was in another person			2
' it ’s been removed and has been on ice for an hour and a half and now we ’re putting it into his cousin			0
' the kidney has gone a lovely pink colour , and it ’s producing urine already , it ’s wonderful			0
