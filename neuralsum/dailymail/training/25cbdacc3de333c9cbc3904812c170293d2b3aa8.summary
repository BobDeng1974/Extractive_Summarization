by @entity0 published : 23:08 est , 9 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:24 est , 10 december 2013 it is a bitter pill to swallow for all of us who enjoy too many fizzy drinks , chocolate and sweets			2
our teeth would be more likely to last the rest of our lives if the world 's recommended sugar intake , already only slightly more than one can of @entity15 , halved to fewer than seven teaspoons a day			1
researchers from @entity17 found people who gained less than five per cent of their energy from ' free sugars ' , added artifically to foods and found naturally in juice , honey and syrup , were more likely to end their lives without cavities			1
sweet tooth : researchers said treats once saved for @entity29 are being eaten every day , with harmful results professor of nutrition and oral health @entity34 said people are eating sugary foods which used to be a birthday or @entity29 treat on a daily basis , the @entity31 reported			2
she added : ' people now expect to keep their teeth into old age and , given that the effects of sugars on our teeth are lifelong , limiting sugars to less than five per cent of the calories we eat would minimise the risk of dental cavities throughout life			0
' we need to make it easier for people to make healthier choices when it comes to sugars by ensuring that options lower in added sugars are made widely available in schools , shops and the workplace			0
' the findings in the @entity63 examined 55 previous studies on the causes of tooth decay , all but eight of which showed a link between sugar intake and cavities over a person 's lifespan			0
a ' significant relationship ' was seen between people who ate less than five per cent of their calories in sugar - just under seven teaspoons a day for women , and just over eight for men			1
sugar : just one can of @entity15 would exceed the recommended daily intake of sugar if it was halved if the new limit was introduced , just one 330ml can of @entity15 would exceed the limit , with 8.75 teaspoons ( 35g ) of sugar in the @entity88			1
the sweet - toothed among us could just about manage a can of @entity91 ( 5.5 teaspoons ) or a bar of @entity93 ( 6.4 teaspoons ) before reaching the limit			1
the data was sourced from trials in countries as far afield as @entity98 , the @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			0
however , the research warned that differences between the data quality in the studies meant the results could be unreliable			0
it also found that no amount of flouride in drinking water could stop tooth decay , the @entity31 reported .			0

@entity113 limit was about 13 teaspoons a day since 1990
a study by @entity17 *suggested* this could be halved
just one can of @entity15 would exceed the new limit if it was introduced
