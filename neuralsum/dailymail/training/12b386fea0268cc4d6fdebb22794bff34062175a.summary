catering manager @entity4 , 46 , suffered spinal injuries after being hit by a 55lb sack of rice that was accidentally dropped by an unnamed inmate at @entity19 in september 2007			1
the mother - of - one , from @entity21 in @entity22 , sued the @entity23 for a six - figure sum for failing to keep her safe at work , and now seems set to receive a heavy payout after a top judge ruled prison bosses were ultimately responsible for her injuries			1
prison officials claimed the accident was not their fault , blaming the ' disobedient and foolish ' inmate for dropping the bag of rice			1
but @entity36 has now ruled that staff were ultimately responsible as the inmate was paid to work in the prison kitchens - even if it was only £ 11.55 a month			1
the judge said : ' the @entity23 took the benefit of this work and i can see no reason why it should not take its burden			2
' ' the work was clearly done on the @entity23 's behalf and for its benefit , ' he added			0
mrs @entity4 had worked at @entity50 , which houses 400 prisoners , for more than 10 years when she was injured following a series of blunders			0
a court heard how she was supervising a team of six prisoners as they carried food from a delivery van to the jail 's first floor kitchen			0
one inmate was trapped in a lift while another managed to spill a sack of rice all over the floor			0
mrs @entity67 ordered the inmates to stop working while she helped clean up the mess			1
but she felt a heavy thud on her upper back when a prisoner accidentally dropped the bag on her			2
lord @entity36 said : ' what had happened was another prisoner ignored her instructions to stop work and had attempted to carry two sacks past her as she knelt			1
' ' but he lost his balance and hit his head on an adjacent wall , one of the sacks he was carrying then fell off his shoulder onto her back , ' he added			0
mrs @entity4 suffered agonising spinal pain after the accident which left her unable to work			1
she subsequently started a claim against the @entity23 for ' very large ' damages after being forced to stop working			2
to blame : lord @entity36 has ruled that staff at @entity19 were ultimately responsible for mrs @entity67 's injuries as the inmate who dropped the bag of rice was being paid to work in the prison kitchens her barrister @entity98 said : ' the ministry should pay for the prisoner 's negligence			1
' ' its relationship to him was materially similar to that of employer and employee ' , he added			0
he also told @entity108 that prison bosses had failed to ensure the inmate was trained in manual handling			1
the county court judge rejected her claim and said the accident happened because of the inmate 's own negligent actions			2
but mrs @entity4 appealed against the ruling and won her case			0
lord @entity36 , sitting with @entity119 and @entity120 at the @entity121 , backed her claim for compensation			0
they ruled that because the prison service paid the inmate for his work they were ' vicariously liable ' for his actions in the same way as any other prison employee			2
mrs @entity4 is now entitled to full compensation for her injuries and the exact amount of her award will be decided at a later date			0
she declined to comment after the case .			0
