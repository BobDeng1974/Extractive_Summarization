the new @entity3 mobile app targets young children with unfair and deceptive advertising and should be investigated , a group of consumer advocates told the @entity6 in a letter tuesday			1
@entity8 introduced the app in february as a ' safer ' place for kids to explore videos because it was restricted to ' family - focused content			1
' but the consumer activists say the app is so stuffed with advertisements and product placements that it 's hard to tell the difference between entertainment and commercials			1
@entity47 ; @entity49 ; and @entity48 leave the world of @entity51 for the first time in 70 years to travel the globe			1
one example is a 7 - minute video of @entity58 's ' @entity57 ' characters who appear as dolls inside a toy @entity61 , eating ice cream and drinking @entity64			1
the activists say digital media should be subject to the same rules as television , which limits commercial content on kids ' programming			2
' as a consumer , you should have the right to know who is trying to persuade you , ' said @entity76 with the @entity77 at @entity78 , who provided legal counsel to the coalition			0
in young children especially , ' it takes unfair advantage of their trusting nature and lack of experience , ' she added			0
in a statement early tuesday , @entity3 said : ' we worked with numerous partners and child advocacy groups when developing @entity3			2
' while we are always open to feedback on ways to improve the app , we were not contacted directly by the signers of this letter and strongly disagree with their contentions , including the suggestion that no free , ad - supported experience for kids will ever be acceptable			1
' we disagree and think that great content should n't be reserved for only those families who can afford it			2
' since its inception in 2005 , @entity3 has become the world 's most popular online video site , with more than 1 billion users			0
for parents , it 's become an easy way to find @entity112 song clips or full episodes of ' @entity114			0
' but when searching for @entity112 or @entity114 , it 's easy to pull up other user - generated content aimed at adults , such as the two puppets cursing or waving guns			1
' now , parents can rest a little easier knowing that videos in the @entity3 app are narrowed down to content appropriate for kids , ' wrote @entity125 , the app 's product manager , in a february blog post			1
according to the consumer groups ' letter , the videos mingle commercial and entertainment content in ways that would n't be allowed on television			1
search for ' @entity135 , ' for example , and the first several options are lengthy advertisements for @entity139 and toy kitchen sets , including one @entity139 segment stretching 19 minutes			2
' the fact that children are viewing the videos on a tablet or smartphone screen instead of on a television screen does not make it any less unfair and deceptive , ' the letter states			2
groups that signed the letter were the @entity156 , the @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , children now , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153			0
@entity160 has learned the app will launch with content from @entity41 , @entity163 , @entity47 , and a handful of popular youtubers and new series , such as @entity48			1
a stock image of @entity168 from @entity169 is shown ' like most parents , i love helping my kids learn more about something they 're interested in , ' said @entity125 , mother of two and @entity175 product manager			2
' for example , right now , i spend a lot of time on @entity3 with my 3 - year - old son , who loves watching videos of car washes , @entity182 , and about the universe			1
' today , we 're introducing the @entity3 app , the first @entity8 product built from the ground up with little ones in mind			1
' the app makes it safer and easier for children to find videos on topics they want to explore , and is available for free on @entity195 and the @entity196 in the @entity197 ' the app includes a timer to limit kids ' screen time , sound settings to turn off background music and sound effects , and search settings to limit your children to just the pre-selected videos available on the home screen			1
@entity210 , the project 's group product manager , told @entity212 that the site has seen a 50 per cent increase in viewing time year - on - year , but that the growth has been around 200 per cent for family entertainment channels			1
' parents were constantly asking us , can you make @entity3 a better place for our kids , ' she said			0
in answer , the company has come up with an app that is simple to use and eliminates features such as viewer comments from the design			2
research show that children are just three clicks away from adult content on @entity3 the home screen comprises eight tiles showing different videos as well as four icons : a tv set for popular tv shows such as @entity169 , a light bulb for educational programmes , a radio for pop songs and a light bulb for popular videos			1
the categories are called : shows , @entity249			0
' the images are big as are the tap targets for small fingers , and since most younger children ca n't type they can search with voice , ' ms @entity210 said			0
if children try and search for a raunchy video , for example , the app simply blocks the request and a box that reads ' try something else ' pops up			2
they will be able to search for topics they are curious about though , such as spaceships and find how - to - make a volcano and maths tutorials , for example			2
the app will also give parents more power over their children 's viewing habits			2
it will give them features to control the time children spend on the app so that it shuts down after a number of minutes or hours			0
it can be re-started again once a password is entered			0
there will also be an option to mute videos - a feature tested by families and @entity285			1
@entity160 has learned the app will launch with content from @entity41 , @entity163 , @entity47 , and a handful of popular youtubers and new series , such as @entity48			1
' the news that @entity3 plans to launch a kid - friendly video app will be welcomed by security savvy parents , ' said @entity294 , principal security researcher , @entity295 ' our research shows that children can be as little as three click away from inappropriate or adult content on the video platform			1
' examining @entity3 's ' suggested ' videos which sit visibly alongside clips or episodes of popular children 's television programmes such as @entity308 , @entity309 and @entity310 , our researchers have found that , on average , users are just three clicks away from content better suited to a more mature audience			1
' the child - focused app will in part compete with @entity319 's kids service and @entity321 's child - friendly app showing age - appropriate video clips			1
the move would appear to be part of @entity8 's strategy to appeal to younger users			0
@entity3 is owned by the search giant			0
@entity8 recently acquired @entity328 , which is behind the @entity330 app @entity331 , and has previously announced plans to make child - friendly versions of some of its products such as @entity337 and @entity338 , as well as @entity3			1
toy manufacturer @entity339 has worked with @entity8 to develop a new version of the @entity341 , which will rely on a smartphone to deliver its optical trickery			0
the virtual reality device makes use of @entity8 's @entity346 to deliver immersive scenes such as @entity348 in @entity349 , called ' 360 degree photospheres '			0
to release the phone 's virtual reality features , an @entity354 smartphone running @entity339 's app is needed			0
@entity341 gets a make - over ! toy manufacturer @entity339 has worked with @entity8 to the new toy , which will rely on a smartphone to deliver its optical trickery			0
an illustration of the new device is shown the smartphone needs to be inserted into the device along with a reel , meaning that parents will have to surrender their handsets while children play			0
the gadget uses augmented reality and animations to make the scenes feel immersive			0
@entity339 says that its view - master is an affordable platform enabling children to take ' engaging field trips ' so they can explore famous landmarks , natural scenes and planets , for example , in ' photospheres '			0
by pairing an ' experience reel ' with a smartphone , children ' will immediately experience an imaginative and interactive learning environment , ' the company says			0
the device itself is set to be released in autumn for $ 30 ( £ 20 ) , with reels sold in themed packs of four for $ 15 ( £ 10 )			0
@entity339 told @entity160 the toy will come to the @entity390 early next year .			0
