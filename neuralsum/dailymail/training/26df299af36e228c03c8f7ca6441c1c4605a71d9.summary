former @entity0 cfo @entity1 now says she regrets letting her @entity3 career consume all her time , keeping her from having a personal life the former finance boss of @entity0 has revealed she deeply regrets the sacrifices she made for her job and told working women : ' it 's not worth it '			1
@entity1 , who was chief financial officer at the bank and one of the most powerful women in finance , says the price she paid to rise to the top of the male - dominated @entity3 world was too high - and that she regrets not having children			1
@entity20 , 47 , revealed that the lack of balance in her life led to her divorce from her first husband , because she would never do anything on the weekends except sleep to ' recharge ' or get an early start on monday 's meetings			1
' sometimes young women tell me they admire what i ’ve done			2
as they see it , i worked hard for 20 years and can now spend the next 20 focused on other things			2
' but that is not balance			2
i do not wish that for anyone , ' she says			2
her confession comes amid increased debate over women in top positions , triggered by @entity47 exec @entity46 and @entity49 ceo @entity48			1
they have called on women to be more vocal in their attempts to break through a male - dominated culture but have still committed to work huge hours			2
@entity46 , 43 , has urged women to ' lean in ' to their careers before having children , rather than step back in order to prioritise family			1
the mother - of - two has sparked uproar by claiming women ' self impose ' limits on their careers - but she has been accused of failing to recognise that most people can not afford nannies that allow them to pursue a big career			1
now @entity20 has entered the debate with a moving op - ed in sunday 's @entity71 where she discusses trying for in vitro fertilization with her new husband and the ' devastation ' she felt after losing her job in 2008			1
@entity20 says she 's spent a lot of time reflecting on the choices she made since resigning just months before the storied investment bank declared bankruptcy , triggering the @entity81			1
@entity20 said she used to spend every waking second thinking about work or glued to her @entity84 , something she now believes was unnecessary having fun : @entity1 says that since she lost her job in 2008 she has been able to focus on her personal life and her new marriage ' i could n’t just rally and move on			1
i did not know how to value who i was versus what i did			0
what i did was who i was , ' she says			0
she has now re-married and is a stepmother			0
she said she and and her second husband are ' hoping ' to conceive her first child through artificial means			1
' i have spent several years now living a different version of my life , where i try to apply my energy to my new husband , @entity103 , and the people whom i love and care about			1
' but i ca n’t make up for lost time , ' she concedes , now acknowledging that ' most importantly ' she does not have children of her own , a far cry from a woman who admits she spent every waking second glued to her @entity84			1
' i have often wondered whether i would have been asked to be c.f.o. if i had not worked the way that i did			0
@entity20 believes she still could have reached an important position in her career even if she had put more of an effort into her personal life lean in : @entity47 coo @entity46 , left , has made news with her book encouraging women to make more of an effort to get ahead in their professional lives while @entity122 , ceo of @entity49 has banned employees from working from home as in her book 's title , @entity46 says women must ' lean in ' to their work as they consider starting a family rather than leaning out , as they usually do ' until recently , i thought my singular focus on my career was the most powerful ingredient in my success			1
but i am beginning to realize that i sold myself short			0
' i was talented , intelligent and energetic			0
it did n’t have to be so extreme			2
besides , there were diminishing returns to that kind of labor , ' she now realizes			0
' i did n’t have to be on my @entity84 from my first moment in the morning to my last moment at night			1
i did n’t have to eat the majority of my meals at my desk			1
' i did n’t have to fly overnight to a meeting in @entity146 on my birthday			0
i now believe that i could have made it to a similar place with at least some better version of a personal life			0
not without sacrifice — i do n’t think i could have “ had it all ” — but with somewhat more harmony			0
' @entity47 chief operating officer @entity46 has made headlines with her book ' @entity157 : women , work and the @entity160 to lead ' , which she says is a call to push feminism forward			1
the business exec , who has a personal wealth of $ 500 million , urges women not to ' lean back ' when it comes to their lives , but to ' lean in ' - give it 100 % in all areas of their life - so they can ' have it all			0
' one of her core beliefs is that the reason why the percentage of women in senior government and business roles in the @entity181 has not risen above 14 per cent is not just down to institutional sexism , but due to women ’s unconscious self - sabotage			0
she warns of the dangers of female self - effacement , hesitancy and over-thinking			0
she identifies priorities for women who want to break through the glass ceiling and join her in the corporate stratosphere			0
first , they must ‘ sit at the table ’ at work , literally and metaphorically			0
do n’t hang around in the background but push forward in the self - confident way men do			0
second , they must ensure their husband or partner does an equal share of the domestic duties			2
finally , and this is the big one , in typical management - speak jargon she says they must n’t ‘ leave before they leave ’ — i.e. if a woman plans to have children , she must keep working and striving for promotion to the bitter end			0
‘ keep your foot on the pedal until the very day you need to leave to take care of a child , ’ she says .			2
