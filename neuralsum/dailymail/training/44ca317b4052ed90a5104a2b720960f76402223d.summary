a @entity1 has inventor has unveiled the ultimate @entity3 gadget - a £ 650 handheld scanner that could be used to copy almost any item			1
the @entity7 scanner , originally developed at @entity8 , can capture everything from a flower ’s petals to the contours of human skin			1
it is able to capture images in seconds , and they can then be sent to a computer for processing			0
it is able to capture images in seconds , and they can then be sent to a computer for processing when combined with a 3d printer , it could be used to create 3d copies of everything from broken parts to @entity31 portraits			1
‘ the explosion of @entity41 and the continued expansion of the games market means that there is an increasing demand for 3d scanning products that capture high resolution 3d data , ’ said @entity35 , the head of @entity7 , the firm using the @entity37 site to raise money for the scanner			1
‘ with @entity7 , our goal is to bring high quality @entity50 to a wider market by making it available at an affordable price - point			0
' the explosion of 3d printing and the continued expansion of the games market means that there is an increasing demand for @entity50 products that capture high resolution 3d data , according to @entity35 , the head of @entity7 experts say the scanner could kickstart the popularity of home 3d printers			2
‘ right now , a large obstacle to @entity41 adoption is the difficulty in producing the digital 3d models required , ’ said @entity66 , ceo , @entity67 , a 3d printing firm			0
when you take a picture on a conventional @entity31 mobile phone or digital camera you are using a technique known as stereoscopic @entity79 uses two camera viewpoints , one for each eye , to display a ‘ @entity31 ’ image on a stereoscopic screen that gives the impression of @entity86 contrast , the core technology behind @entity7 fuses geometric and photometric stereo 3d capture - producing both the shape and exact @entity89 raw capability provides the opportunity for an object to be captured in true @entity31 geometry and full color for any other non-medical applications			2
‘ a high quality affordable scanner will really change the 3d printing game and @entity7 ’s 3d scanner looks set to put @entity102 capability into everyone ’s hands			1
’ the technology behind @entity7 was originally developed within @entity8 and was , at first , developed for medical imaging applications			0
' with @entity7 , we plan to adapt a technology that has already been proven in the medical sector to deliver a new 3d scanning option to professionals and consumers with a passion for 3d creativity , ' said @entity115 , who developed the scanner			2
‘ the unique technology that we have developed allows us to offer what is literally a point - and - shoot approach to capturing both 3d data and colour , and we are confident that no one else in the world is able to offer this kind of solution at the price that we can achieve			0
' the above sequence shows a selection of prototypes and concepts that have led to the @entity7 scanner			1
