by @entity0 published : 10:30 est , 25 april 2012 updated : 02:45 est , 26 april 2012 the big bang theory was coined in the 40s - but physicists still puzzle over whether it even happened			2
@entity5 , the astronomer and physicist who coined the term , ' @entity4 , ' much preferred the idea that the universe might have existed forever			1
now two mathematicians claim to have ' proved ' that it did n't - it might not have an end , but the universe definitely had a beginning			1
@entity4 ? two mathematicians argue that although the universe may not have an end , it definitely did have a beginning - and they have the maths to prove it the universe is expanding - so it ca n't simply have ' sat still ' forever			1
but some mathematicians thought it perhaps worked on a ' cycle ' the future might be eternal , but the past is not , claim the mathematicians from @entity27			1
' one of the most basic questions in cosmology is whether the universe had a beginning or has simply existed forever , ' say mathematicians @entity34 , @entity35			1
' it was addressed in the singularity theorems of @entity38 and @entity39 , with the conclusion that the initial singularity is not avoidable			0
' the universe is expanding , which fits with the theory of an ' initial singularity ' - an infinitely dense object that exploded into the @entity4			1
this is measurable from @entity50 - and so the universe ca n't simply have ' sat still ' since the beginning of time			1
however , three theories allow the universe to expand without requiring a ' beginning '			1
' there are , however , three popular scenarios which circumvent these theorems : eternal inflation , a cyclic universe , and an ' emergent ' universe which exists for eternity as a static seed before expanding , ' say @entity34 and @entity35			2
the pair mathemtacially analysed the three scenarios and found that eternity can not exist in our expanding universe			0
there was a beginning , whether or not it was the @entity4			1
' we have addressed three scenarios which seemed to oer a way to avoid a beginning , and have found that none of them can actually be eternal in the past , ' say @entity34 and @entity35			2
put simply , the future could be eternal , but the past can not			0
@entity75 : he was right about the expansion of the universe of the three ' theories ' of an eternal universe , the mathematicians say , ' two of these scenarios are geodesically incomplete to the past , and thus can not describe a universe without a beginning			1
the third , although it is stable with respect to classical perturbations , can collapse quantum mechanically , and therefore can not have an eternal past			0
' ' @entity34 and @entity35 point to a proof dating from 2003 that these kind of past trajectories can not be infinite if they are part of a universe that expands in a specific way			0
they go on to show that cyclical universes and universes of eternal inflation both expand in this way			0
so they can not be eternal in the past and must therefore have had a beginning , ' says @entity107 's @entity106 , which reported the research			2
the expansion of our universe seems to bear the signs of a @entity4 - type event , in the form of ' waves ' seen in galaxies			1
galaxies and clusters of galaxies are clumped together into walls and filaments , with giant voids between			0
these structures grew out of subtle variations in density in the early universe , which bore the imprint of “ baryon acoustic oscillations ” -- pressure - driven acoustic ( sound ) waves that passed through the early universe			2
billions of years later , the record of these sound waves can still be read in our universe			0
‘ because of the regularity of the ancient sound waves , there ’s a slightly increased probability that any two galaxies today will be separated by about 500 million light - years , rather than 400 million or 600 million , ’ said @entity135			0
in a graph of the number of galaxy pairs by separation distance , that magic number of 500 million light - years shows up as a peak , so astronomers often speak of the ‘ peak separation ’			0
the position of this peak depends on the amount of dark energy in the universe			0
but measuring the distance between galaxies depends critically on having the right distances to the galaxies in the first place .			0

three theories of ' eternal ' universe all *wrong* claim mathematicians
@entity164 definitely had a ' beginning ' - whether or not it was the @entity4
