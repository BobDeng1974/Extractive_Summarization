by @entity0 my five - year - old daughter , @entity1 , caused something of a stir at the school gates last week as she waltzed in with a canvas rucksack slung across her shoulders			1
because this was no ordinary rucksack			2
this was @entity11 ’s highly sought - after canvas graffiti backpack , designed by creative director @entity12 for his pop art collection , modelled at @entity14 by model of the moment , @entity17 , and , despite the eye - watering price of £ 2,100 , already a sell - out			1
what sort of a mother do you think i am ? i would no more buy my daughter a @entity11 bag than i would buy her a pair of @entity29 stilettos			1
but i do n’t like the term fake — it conjures up images of nasty backstreet market stalls and ill - gotten gains funding drug cartels			2
i prefer to think of this as a carefully crafted , handmade homage			2
when i saw the pictures of this coveted and unattainable item i thought i must be mistaken			0
rather than being the elegant leather accessory @entity11 is famous for , this resembles the kind of customised and grubby backpack touted around by particularly scruffy school children			1
but cooler and richer people clearly disagree			0
twilight star @entity51 was spotted in @entity52 in march carrying a black version of the backpack , complete with her trademark skinny jeans and sneakers			0
in a magnificent truism , @entity12 said of the collection that spawned the bag : ‘ life is not a red carpet			1
this is for daily life			0
’ but of course , because we all drag £ 2,100 backpacks round @entity65 ’s , do n’t we ? frankly , this bag looked like it had been made by a five - year - old			1
which , of course , made me wonder : could a five - year - old make it ? i decided to find out			0
@entity1 was up for the challenge , so i scoured the internet to find a basic bag that we could customise			1
i finally found a plain beige canvas rucksack on @entity77 , costing just £ 7 — which would buy me approximately one third of a @entity11 lipgloss ( £ 22 )			1
@entity1 ( left ) , aged 5 , poses with the homage to the designer bag ( right ) she made with her mother @entity83 for the all - important @entity11 logo , @entity84 , editor of new magazine @entity85 , advises i use freezer paper			1
this is sold by craft shops , and is ordinary paper on one side and has a thin plastic coating on the other			2
this means that when you iron the plain side , it sticks to fabric			0
using a cereal bowl and a mug as a template for the concentric circles that make up the interlinking ‘ @entity99 , @entity1 draws the design on to the freezer paper , carefully cuts it out and i then iron the two ‘ c ’s on to the bag			1
we are amazed at how authentic it looks			0
i wonder where this might lead — @entity1 and i could do pencil cases and wash bags for the next school fete and make our fortune			1
i ’m just taking the top off the red paint , a leftover from one of the children ’s art projects , when we ’re interrupted by a very cross voice			2
it ’s my husband , @entity125			0
‘ do n’t use spray paint in the kitchen , ’ he thunders			1
’ i bet @entity129 never got yelled at mid-creation			0
out in the garden , we gently spray the paints on in layers of brown , then red , then green and finally the beige , and then use some of the children ’s stencils to write the words , ‘ 31 @entity140 ’			2
@entity1 ( left ) was in charge of plaiting and twisting a load of polyester cords that @entity31 ( right ) bought from a craft shop the bag only cost £ 7 to make but @entity31 ( left ) admits : ' if we were less of an artsy - crafty family , we might not have had everything we needed and i would have had to spend about £ 50 on materials			1
' pictured : @entity1 ( right ) now , we have to make the — frankly messy looking — rope of tangled cord and carabiners , those weird hooks used by mountaineers , and , fortuitously , my husband for securing his bike to the car			1
why on earth they are on a fashion backpack is beyond me			0
@entity161 task @entity1 with plaiting and twisting a load of polyester cords that i bought from a craft shop , and then , to make the final , smaller @entity165 ’s in silver and white , we draw around a pepperpot and then outline the edges of the ‘ @entity99 with a silver pen			1
we are shamelessly pleased with the final result and prance around like delighted show ponies			0
my husband , who has been sniggering as he watches us painstakingly plait , spray and glue , is genuinely impressed			2
( ok , his exact words were : ‘ it ’s really good , i thought it was going to be rubbish			0
’ ) i have a host of arty friends whom i text with a picture of the bag			2
they are similarly wowed — one claims not to be able to tell the difference at all			0
i ’m pretty sure that everyone ( myself included ) assumed that this project was going to be a disaster			0
if we were less of an artsy - crafty family , we might not have had everything we needed and i would have had to spend about £ 50 on materials			0
still , that ’s about one fortieth of the retail price of the real thing			0
now all we need is for some sap to offer more than £ 2,100 for our version , and we really will be laughing all the way to the bank			0
but not as much as @entity11 , who have created a bag so simple that even a five - year - old can make a convincing copy .			1

@entity0 and daughter @entity1 re-created the @entity11 bag
they used freezing paper , spray paint and tangled cords
