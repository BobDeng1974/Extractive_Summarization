historian @entity0 has defended his controversial outburst on @entity2 which sparked a racism storm following the riots - by protesting that the subject of race has become unmentionable			1
the writer and broadcaster was condemned for commenting on @entity2 that ' whites have become black ' , while appearing to blame the disorder on black ' gangsta ' culture			1
hitting back at his detractors , he said the reaction to his remarks had been hysterical			1
@entity0 sparked anger as he suggested that black ' gangster ' culture had become the norm ' we will not continue , i think , to tolerate being lied to and cheated in the matter of race , ' he wrote in the @entity24			2
' instead of ' not in front of the children ' , we want honesty			2
' the historian 's original comments prompted hundreds of complaints , with the @entity31 saying viewers felt his contribution to the programme was ' inappropriate and racially offensive '			1
but @entity0 told the newspaper : ' i thought my appearance on @entity2 was supposed to be part of a wide - ranging discussion about the state of the nation			1
' central to any such discussion , it seems to me , are the successes and failures of integration in @entity46 in the past 50 years			2
and it was these that i was trying to address			0
' admitting that his friends agreed his greatest error was mentioning former politician @entity52 , whose 1968 @entity53 attacked immigration , he added that a legacy of the reaction to @entity52 had been ' an enforced silence on the matter of race '			2
he wrote : ' the subject has become unmentionable , by whites at any rate			0
and any breach has been punished by ostracism and worse			0
response : the @entity31 fought back against complaints from viewers that dr @entity0 's views were not challenged strongly enough ' as the hysterical reaction to my remarks shows , the witch - finders already have their sights on me			1
' he also insisted he had been trying to point out ' the very different patterns of integration at the top and bottom of the social scale			0
' he wrote : ' at the top , successful blacks , like ( mps ) @entity82 and @entity83 have merged effortlessly into what continues to be a largely white elite ... ' at the bottom of the heap , the story of integration is the opposite : it is the white lumpen proletariat , cruelly known as the ' chavs ' , who have integrated into the pervasive black ' gangsta ' culture			0
' riots : mr @entity0 claims last week 's unrest was caused by the spread of black culture and he defended his right to point out problems in the black community			0
' if all the people of this country , black and white alike , are to enter fully into our national story , as i desperately hope they will , they must do so on terms of reciprocity , ' he wrote			0
' in other words , i must be as free to comment on problems in the black community as blacks are to point the finger at whites , which they do frequently , often with justice , and with impunity			0
' dr @entity0 's @entity2 appearance sparked criticism from political figures including mr @entity82 , who called his views ' irrelevant ' , and @entity124 leader @entity123 , who said it was ' absolutely outrageous ' that someone in the 21st century should be making such comments .			1
