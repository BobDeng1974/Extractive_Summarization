straight after @entity0 on planet football comes squeaky bum time , but the only squeaking at @entity4 came from @entity5 , trying to contain his mirth when told @entity7 had the most positive tactics in @entity9			1
@entity5 was having no truck with the @entity13 's @entity12 table , which lauded the @entity7 for their attacking style and frowned upon @entity4 's lack of respect			1
he dismissed it as a joke			2
he was relaxed ahead of a visit from @entity20			2

' it looks like they do n't deserve respect , that they are bad players , that the manager is a bad manager , that they are a disaster			1
but they are the champions			0
' you want lots of teams fighting for the title			2
' so how can you be so negative with a team that 's won two titles in three years ? some managers can not win and life goes on , but the guys at @entity24 ... it looks like they 're criminals			1
