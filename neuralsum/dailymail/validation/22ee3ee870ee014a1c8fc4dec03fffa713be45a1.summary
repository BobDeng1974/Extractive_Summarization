thousands of people gathered in a small @entity2 town this weekend to watch rattlesnakes get cleaned , skinned , milked and more - some visitors even left their mark on the wall with bloody hand prints			1
the @entity9 â€™s @entity8 hosts hunts , beauty and eating contests , demonstrations , vendors selling snake - skin products and more			1
attendees could even buy fried rattlesnake , which apparently takes like chicken			0
before the snakes are cooked , however , they are passed through an assembly line , where they are killed , decapitated , then cleaned and skinned as they hang from a wire			0
the roundup , which has been going on since 1958 and is the oldest and grandest in @entity2 , began to control the population of rattlesnakes in the area , according to the @entity28 , but now more people are drawn to the sheer awe of the event			1
@entity33 said if they do n't get stirred up , the snakes on the bottom of the pile could suffocate from the weight of the snakes on top of them a group of boys watch a rattlesnake in a pit at the @entity36 's @entity8 as a snake handler makes sure the snakes are moved around a handler shows off a rattlesnakes fangs , which are connected by venom ducts to poison glands in the snake 's jaw			2
when fangs are not in use , they fold against the snake 's palate a crowed watches a handler behead rattlesnakes before they are skinned			2
a bolt is fired into the snake 's head before it is chopped off @entity36 clean and skin the rattlesnakes before they are cooked			1
onlookers help clean and skin the reptiles if they wanted a crowed watches handlers clean and skin rattlesnakes during the 2015 @entity73 at the @entity74 the rattlesnakes are suspended in the air as handlers clean and skin the reptiles			2
crowds gather as the handlers approach the snakes barehanded the four - day event takes place in @entity37 's @entity74 , which is also used for the county fair , rodeos and other large events in the area			1
the event brings more than $ 2million into @entity37 - a town with a population of 11,400 - and proceeds go toward community projects , youth sports and helping the disabled and disadvantaged			1
a hunt for snakes starts about a month before the roundup , and hunters are able to harvest about 5,000 pounds of snakes - which averages out into about 1,000 snakes			0
hunters use a gassing technique , where they spray gasoline through copper tubes to lure the snakes from their hiding places			0

those onlookers brave enough to help skin a snake can put their hand on the wall for all to see @entity126 , from @entity127 , @entity2 , puts his hand prints on the wall after skinning a rattlesnake on saturday at the @entity8 the @entity8 featured demonstrations , eating contests , cleaning and skinning viewings and more throughout the four - day event crowds came from all over to the 11,400 - person town to attend the annual @entity8 , which has been held annually since the 1950s @entity138 prepares to milk a rattlesnake as a crowd watches the demonstration			1
the four - day event brings about $ 2million into the @entity37 community but the gassing method is controversial in @entity2 , as people fear it hurts other animals and habitats , and could be facing a ban , leaving an uncertain future for the roundup			1
hunters use the gasoline to hunt in large volume in colder , wetter weather			0
if gassing is banned , they will potentially have to postpone the roundup			0
though the @entity156 has been looking into gassing for years and nearly banned it in 2013 , the organization delayed making a decision until september so @entity37 representatives and researchers could propose an alternative solution			0
some opponents to the @entity8 are concerned with the treatment and slaying of the rattlesnakes and suggested a no - kill roundup			0
@entity167 , however , told the @entity28 that it would be irresponsible to release such a dangerous creature back into the area after capturing it			0
@entity138 milks a rattlesnake during a demonstration			0
proceeds from the event pay community projects , youth sports and helping the poor and disabled in @entity37 @entity138 shows a recently milked rattlesnake to the crownd and even lets a young girl touch the end of its body as a crowd watches @entity36 say that the the roundup harvests about 5,000lb of snakes each year , which serves as a form of population control			2
