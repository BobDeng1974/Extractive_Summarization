it was revealed on tuesday night ’s special @entity2 episode that @entity3 had been killed in her own home			1
and on the latest instalment of the @entity8 soap , the ongoing murder mystery unravelled even further when a distraught @entity9 ( @entity9 ) was finally told the truth by his girlfriend @entity11 ( @entity12 ) , who pointed the finger at his own parents			1
in a dramatic cliffhanger showdown , the troubled youngster rushed home to confront his father @entity18 ( @entity19 ) and stepmother @entity20 ( @entity21 ) after they tied the knot in front of all their family and friends , accusing one of them of murdering his twin sister			1
she had fled @entity50 to avoid a confrontation , but her father @entity52 found her waiting in an abortion clinic after uncovering the truth about the pregnancy by checking her phone			2
suspicious : @entity20 had been wracked with nerves since reading @entity11 's note and was extremely flustered while saying her wedding vows to @entity18 surprise ! it was revealed that @entity11 is expecting @entity9 's child , with her father @entity63 turning up at an abortion clinic to talk her into keeping the baby he proceeded to talk her out of making a rash decision , all the while probing whether she would be going to the police about @entity3 's killer since he still believes that his youngest daughter @entity69 is the culprit			1
‘ i ’m not doing it because i do n’t love it			0
i ’m doing this because i already do			0
it ’s for the best ’ , @entity11 cryptically declared			2
and when @entity69 spilled the beans to @entity9 , he missed his own father 's wedding to find @entity11 at the clinic and tell her he wants to keep the baby			1
shocker : @entity52 confronted his daughter @entity11 at an abortion clinic ‘ i always wanted kids			0
loads of them and i want them with you ’ , he pleaded			0
‘ i know we ’d be young parents , but we ’d be really good at it			0
i ’d do everything for you … both of you			0
’ but it seems @entity11 has already made up her mind and wants nothing to do with the @entity9 family , deciding to tell @entity9 the terrible truth about who killed his twin sister all those months ago			1
@entity20 and @entity18 – who have both been prime suspects in the never - ending murder mystery – certainly raised suspicions throughout the episode as they were both visibly dealing with guilt			1
as they exchanged vows , @entity11 ’s note ( which featured prominently in tuesday ’s programme ) preyed heavily on @entity20 ’s mind			2
visibly flustered , she paused the ceremony to ask where @entity9 was and stopped to get a glass of water			0
anxious : @entity20 struggled to go through with the ceremony and is hiding something from her family recovering enough to continue with the wedding , she made a speedy exit during the pub after - party and seemed to be preparing for the worst when @entity18 came to find her at home , shortly followed by @entity9			1
as suspected , the @entity121 ( @entity120 ) storyline from the first of this week ’s special 30th anniversary episodes was a red herring			1
the soap kicked off with the outraged blonde querying why her father @entity63 thought she had killed @entity3			2
‘ you were pretty angry with her			0
you might have pushed her , she might have banged her head or something ’ , he explained			0
@entity69 retorted : ‘ i told you we had a row , and i slapped her ! ’ not guilty : the @entity121 bombshell turned out to be a red herring , although she did confess she wished she had killed @entity3 , who was having an affair with her father @entity63 was still convinced his youngest daughter is the culprit and tried to cover it up from her mother @entity143 , who returned to @entity50 especially for @entity18 and @entity20 ’s nuptials			1
actress @entity145 made a welcome return to the soap after almost two years away and had her moment of glory when she confronted @entity69 about her alleged crime			1
‘ i did n’t , but i wish i had [ killed @entity3 ] ’ , @entity69 declared			0
however , @entity145 unfortunately fluffed one of her live lines earlier on in the episode , mentioning @entity18 by the actor 's real name , @entity156 [ @entity19 ]			1
she asked , ' how 's @entity156 ? ' , leading to a confused look from her scene partner @entity21 [ @entity20 ]			2
short - lived comeback : @entity145 has returned to the soap for two episodes as @entity143 elsewhere , soap veteran @entity162 ( @entity163 ) confessed to a murder of her own			2
she went to the hospital to apologise to bed - ridden @entity166 ( @entity167 ) – who has just woken up from her coma – for her son @entity169 ( @entity170 ) putting her there			0
but as she was pouring her heart out about leaving drug addict to die , her grandson @entity172 ( @entity173 ) entered the room and was stunned to discover the truth about his father ’s last days			0
‘ i ’ve killed my son ’ , the god - faring pensioner admitted			0
@entity182 continues on thursday night , when viewers will finally discover who killed @entity3 , and concludes with a fully - live episode on friday			1
guilty : @entity162 confessed that she had left her drug addict son @entity186 to die			0
