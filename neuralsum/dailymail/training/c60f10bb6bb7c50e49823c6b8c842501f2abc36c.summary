by @entity0 published : 20:21 est , 31 january 2013 updated : 20:21 est , 31 january 2013 councils in @entity2 and @entity4 claim bins attract more litter a council has decided to remove all litter bins from residential streets with the extraordinary claim they ‘ attract more rubbish ’			1
officials in @entity2 and @entity4 claim bins encourage fly - tipping and increase - rather than decrease - the level of litter on the streets			1
the @entity19 borough is home to some of the most expensive houses in the @entity23 , with some costing many millions of pounds			2
from now on , passers - by will only be allowed to dispose of rubbish in busy areas , including shopping and tourist streets			2
last night , residents hit out at the plans , which they say would lead to more rubbish building up outside their homes			0
@entity33 , 27 , a pr manager from @entity34 , said : ‘ i do n’t think they have asked the local residents			0
they are always full , people use them			0
they should be adding more , not taking them away			0
’ but the council defended its position by saying businesses were dumping large quantities of waste in the bins			1
in a trial in @entity34 , council officers reported only a very slight increase in littering when bins were removed			2
@entity48 , head of waste at the council , said in a report : ‘ there are two schools of thought regarding litter bins ; one is that litter bins are needed for the public to use , indeed that some members of the public look for litter bins in which to deposit waste , otherwise they may take it home or drop it on the street			1
‘ the other is that litter bins attract more rubbish , some of which can be unpaid - for commercial waste and domestic waste			1
’ @entity70 in the @entity71 where the no - bin strategy is being adopted @entity74 ( left ) and @entity75 ( right ) are in the affluent borough of @entity2 and @entity4 the scheme follows the council ’s ‘ naked streets ’ policy of taking away all road markings , signs and pedestrian barriers from @entity83			2
it is the first council in @entity19 to pursue an anti-bin strategy which , could be repeated elsewhere if successful			1
the move was prompted by the fact that its bins have been on the streets for more than 15 years and are costly to repair or replace , the @entity87 reported			0
@entity2 and @entity4 is home to @entity92 , which was last year named the most expensive street in @entity23			0
@entity92 , named the most expensive street in @entity23 , is in the borough of @entity2 and @entity4 where bins will be removed			0
