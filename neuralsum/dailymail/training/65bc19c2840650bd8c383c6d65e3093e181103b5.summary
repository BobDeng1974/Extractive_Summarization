by @entity0 a child survived her heart stopping four times in 45 minutes after she suffered a rare reaction to a sore throat - and blew - up ‘ like @entity6 from @entity7 ’			1
five - year - old @entity9 ‘ swelled like a blueberry ’ and was diagnosed with a rare reaction to the sore throat bacteria @entity12 the reaction caused her heart to fail three times in quick succession as the infection took hold of her body			1
@entity9 suffered four heart attacks after having a severe reaction to the sore throat bacterium medics warned her parents to say their last goodbyes because they feared she would not survive another resuscitation			1
but miraculously she survived a her heart stopping for a fourth time in 45 minutes after doctors hooked her up to an artificial lung and heart machine			1
the machine oxygenated her blood and pumped it round her frail body , bypassing the heart , while dialysis cleansed her blood of toxins			1
@entity9 developed a rash which spread across her body turning her purple and fluids being pumped through her body to clear her of infection made her balloon in size			2
amazingly , @entity9 pulled through and the rash turned from purple to red before fading completely			2
delighted parents @entity46 and @entity48 - @entity47 , who also have a ten - year - old - son called @entity50 , say after ten weeks in hospital she is now recovering well			2
@entity9 was rushed to hospital after her parents noticed she was breathing heavily and had developed a rash she was transferred to @entity54 and within an hour of arriving she had her first heart attack mr @entity56 , 44 , said : ‘ she was breathing heavily so we took her to the local hospital at about 11pm			1
we ’re so glad we did that			0
‘ she was rushed straight to @entity54 and within an hour of her being there had her first heart attack			1
‘ after her third heart attack a surgeon told us about a risky procedure they could try			0
‘ i just cut him off			0
i said “ do it , do it now - i ’ll sign whatever forms i need to later ”			0
‘ if she had been at any other hospital which had n’t had the ability to bypass her heart she would n’t be here now			2
my wife was like mush in my arms			0
‘ all that was going through our heads was how we were going to tell @entity50 that one day he had a perfectly healthy sister and the next day she ’d gone to hospital and died			0
@entity9 had four heart attacks within 45 minutes and doctors told her parents to say goodbye @entity9 ( pictured recovering in hospital ) was saved by medics who put her on an artificial heart and lung machine ‘ you are numb , it is like you are on rails on a journey , you are in a process and you have to keep going			1
‘ when people say to me i do n’t know how you coped - i say ‘ you just do because you have to ’			0
‘ she looked like @entity6 from @entity7 , bless her			0
she was purple from head to toe			0
she ’s our little miracle			0
’ @entity9 suddenly fell ill and on january 27 was repeatedly getting up in the night			2
mr and mrs @entity9 rushed her to @entity97 and @entity98 , @entity99 , after they realised she was heavily breathing and noticed a small rash			1
doctors knew the rash was a bad sign and transferred her to @entity54 overnight			1
@entity9 has been in hospital for three months but has moved from @entity54 to her local hospital there she was diagnosed with a toxic shock reaction to @entity12 - a common bacterium which normally causes sore throats			1
the infection caused @entity9 ’s body to shut down and she has been left with movement problems after he limbs were affected by a lack of circulation			2
@entity9 also suffers from a condition called @entity116			2
it is a genetic condition which affects the ribs structure , meaning @entity9 has no ribs on the front of her body and her ribs are n’t attached to her spine			2
she was also born with a large cleft palate , which has since been fixed and has a recessed bottom jaw			0
although the condition is unrelated to the infection , it meant @entity54 doctors knew @entity9 ’s medical history inside out and were able to efficiently treat her			1
@entity9 ( pictured in hospital ) is slowly recovering but it is not yet clear if she will make a full recovery @entity9 underwent a tracheotomy and has this week been moved back to @entity97 and @entity98 for physiotherapy and rehabilitation			1
mr @entity56 , a photographer , sad : ‘ we really do n’t know the prognosis , it depends on how she reacts to physio but we have a child , we have @entity9 - it does n’t matter what ’s wrong with her , at least she ’s here			0
’ a @entity54 spokesman said : ‘ @entity9 is the only @entity12 streptococcal case who has gone on to develop toxic shock requiring @entity149 at the hospital in the last two years			1
’ strep a bacteria is often found on the skin and throat and minor infections are common in adults and children			0
it only poses a potentially serious threat to health if it penetrates deeper inside the tissues or organs			0
@entity9 was born with a cleft palate and a recessed jaw as well as rib abnormalities the family , from @entity166 , @entity99 , are now trying to raise £ 80,000 to buy two @entity168 machines for the hospital			1
a group of parents will be running 50km from @entity166 village green to the doors of @entity54 on sunday , may 18			0
@entity149 machines , which are used to treat a number of conditions , are similar to the heart - lung bypass machine used for open heart surgery			1
the technology was first used successfully in the @entity180 in 1976 and introduced into the @entity181 in 1989			0
@entity54 is one of three centres in @entity184 and @entity185 with an @entity186 donate visit www.justgiving.com/avas-ecmo-challenge			0
