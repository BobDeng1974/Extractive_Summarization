scientists in @entity1 claim to have captured the sound made by a single atom and say it is a very , very high - pitched high @entity5 - undetectable to the human ear			1
the experts , from @entity8 in @entity9 , were investigating the relationship between sound and atoms in the hope of learning more about quantum physics			1
the believe manipulating sound on the quantum level could lead to new developments in computing - giving us faster and more efficient computers			2
scientists in @entity1 claim to have captured the sound made by a single atom and say it is a very high - pitched high @entity5 ( file picture ) to reach their conclusion , they constructed an artificial atom 0.01 millimeters large			1
just like real atoms , artificial ones can be charged up with energy which they subsequently emit in the form of a particle - usually the particle is light , but in this experiment it would be sound			0
the scientists started by placing the artificial atom on to a superconducting material , designed to carry sound - waves efficiently			1
after guiding sound along the material and bouncing it off the atom , they were able to record what came back - using a minute microphone			0
the researchers believe manipulating sound on the quantum level could lead to new developments in quantum computing what they recorded was a d - note , around 20 octaves above the highest note on a piano - which is much higher than the human ear can detect			1
@entity55 , the physics professor who led the experimental research group , said : ' we have opened a new door into the quantum world by talking and listening to atoms			0
' our long term goal is to harness quantum physics so that we can benefit from its laws , for example in extremely fast computers			0
' the study 's co-author , @entity69 , added : ' according to the theory , the sound from the atom is divided into quantum particles			2
' such a particle is the weakest sound that can be detected ' @entity75 has a short wavelength and travels 100,000 times slower than light , which means it 's much easier to control			0
the process opens huge potential for taking control over quantum phenomena			0
the university 's article on the study , @entity85 coupled to an artificial atom , can be found on their website .			2

study done at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity1
experts bounced sound off artificial atom and recorded noise that came back
found that atom produced a d - note , 20 octaves above piano 's highest note
this is far higher than the human ear can detect
scientists believe study could pave way for *progress* in quantum computing
