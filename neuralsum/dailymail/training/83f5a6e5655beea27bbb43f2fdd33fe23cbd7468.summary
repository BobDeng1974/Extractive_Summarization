iconic ' 90s model @entity0 , who championed the ' heroin chic ' look of the grunge era along with @entity5 , is making a comeback			0
she quit the business to compete as a professional motor racing driver at @entity9 and then play polo for @entity11 but @entity12 is coming full circle and returning to the fashion world after seven years away			1
the 6ft 2 " mother - of - one , who still boasts the razor - sharp cheekbones she was famed for , has now been signed to next models			1
@entity0 is returning to the fashion world after seven years away from the industry ' even though i walked away from [ modelling ] , i was still surrounded by it			0
i 've always loved seeing it all in magazines , and my sister @entity25 is a big make - up artist , so it was still part of my world			2
but i saw a big resurgence of my friends - @entity31 [ @entity32 ] , @entity33 , @entity34 [ @entity35 ] - in magazines			2
there seemed to be this huge revival , with the public falling in love with them again , and they all look so bloody amazing ! ' the 34 - year - old tells @entity44			1
' it was so refreshing , as a consumer , to be looking at a beautiful woman for once , rather than a teenager			0
when i was modelling , i was a skinny little 16 - year - old girl , supposedly selling clothes to 40 - year - old women			2
i love seeing these women - not girls - modelling fashion , ' she says			2
@entity12 , who features on the cover of this week 's issue of the listings magazine , started out as a waifish teenager , but is now happy that ' proper , grown up ' women are being chosen for fashion campaigns			1
@entity12 enjoyed the perks of modelling but after a while became disillusioned and left to explore other careers she enjoyed the glamorous side of the job , such as drinking and partying with the @entity68 , and working for then - up and coming designers @entity70 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
but @entity12 was disillusioned abut the rewards hard work would bring			1
the control she had over her sporting career meant it was more fulfilling for her in that respect			0
@entity12 , still stunning at 34 , has signed up to next models and says modelling is her priority now ' @entity85 was always something i had to learn			1
i would turn up and put 110 percent in , and be on time with clean hair and a full night 's sleep			2
but it would n't necessarily make any difference at all , and you could easily lose out to someone who 'd just come in stinking of booze			0
i had to learn that you ca n't do a " good job "			0
with animals , what you put in is what you get out			0
as a competitor - showjumping and racing cars - i have the control			1
with modelling , you just had to sit there			0
it was n't possible to have ambitions			0
' while modelling is top priority for her career at the moment , @entity12 says she would love to go back on @entity114			1
