by @entity0 last updated at 11:01 pm on 29th september 2011 a husband convicted of killing his wife underwater more than a decade ago is a free man again after a panel of judges overturned the ruling			1
it was alleged @entity7 , 55 , killed @entity8 , 46 , by tearing off her scuba mask as they swam by a shipwreck in the @entity12			1
but the expert diver today walked free after appeal judges found problems with jury instructions read by a judge during the trial in 2009			2
free : @entity7 , centre , and his daughter @entity21 , right , speak with a guard after his release from jail in the @entity12 today @entity7 , of @entity25 , has protested his innocence since she died in 1999 , claiming he tried to revive her with cpr after an accident			1
now @entity32 judges have found problems with jury instructions read out during the trial			0
the court did not order a new trial because of concerns about recalling defence witnesses , given the amount of time passed since the death			0
‘ i feel elated , ’ @entity7 said as he left court with his daughter @entity21 , who has also long maintained her father 's innocence			2
conviction overturned : it was believed @entity7 , 55 , killed @entity8 , 46 , by tearing off her scuba mask while they swam by a shipwreck in 1999 he said the two intend to return to @entity25 ‘ sooner rather than later			1
’ a jury had unanimously convicted @entity7 in october 2009 of murdering ms @entity8 in what authorities described as a near - perfect crime			1
he was ordered to serve at least 25 years of a mandatory life sentence			0
but defence lawyer @entity56 argued the judge did not adequately advise the jury on how to handle evidence from a related civil suit			0
authorities initially ruled @entity63 's drowning near an isolated shipwreck at a depth of 80ft as an accident			0
@entity12 : a jury had unanimously convicted @entity7 in october 2009 of murdering ms @entity8 in what authorities described as a near - perfect crime but they later charged @entity7 with murder following a 2006 civil trial in @entity25 that found him responsible for her death			1
the civil jury awarded ms @entity8 's family $ 3.5million , and @entity7 later filed for bankruptcy			1
prosecutors had argued that @entity7 killed @entity63 because he was in love with another woman and wanted to obtain his wife 's money			2
their case rested largely on experts who believed @entity7 attacked his wife from behind , yanked off her scuba mask and cut off her air supply			1
authorities said her mask was damaged , the mouthpiece of her snorkel was missing , and that her fin was found embedded in a sandbar			0
when dive shop owner @entity7 was sentenced to at least 25 years in jail , the world believed that the mystery which began in 1999 when his wife 's body was found floating had been closed for good			2
two years ago : @entity7 , second right , is escorted to the prison vehicle after being found guilty of murdering his wife ( file picture from october 2009 ) but thursday 's news of an overturned conviction is just another chapter in an amazing story			1
police at first wrote off her drowning as a tragic accident - a strange but otherwise unremarkable death of an experienced diver on a romantic getaway to one of the world 's premier dive spots			0
prosecutors accused him of drowning his wife on the last day of their holiday so he could pursue a romance with a @entity25 chiropractor as well as gain his wife 's inheritance of $ 630,000			0
but defence lawyers maintained a poor post-mortem report could not rule out medical reasons for her death , including the possibility she had a heart attack or stroke during an accidental drowning			0
the case , which attracted tv shows including ' @entity137 , ' produced one of the most sensational trials in the history of the tiny @entity12 @entity142 territory , where violence is relatively rare .			0

@entity7 , 55 , allegedly killed @entity8 in 1999 in @entity12
prosecutors had claimed he *ripped* off her scuba mask so she *suffocated*
