by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:46 pm on 18th august 2011 there must be consistency in sentencing for those found guilty of riot - related crimes , the country 's former top prosecutor said today			1
youths who are found guilty of a crime should receive similar sentences to those found guilty of the same offence , otherwise it is ' just not justice '			1
@entity15 , the former director of public prosecutions in @entity16 and @entity17 , urged judges to avoid the ' moral panic ' elsewhere in society when sentencing those involved in the riots and looting			1
the statement came after the news a university student who stole three or four bottles of alcohol from a @entity29 store during the riots was handed a 16 month jail term			1
rioting : sentences for similar offences should n't be wildly different @entity15 called on the @entity34 , who have not met since the riots , to issue new guideline ' as soon as it can feasibly do so '			1
speaking to @entity40 's today programme , he said : ' i think it 's important that the courts retain their objectivity , remain dispassionate and do n't get swept up in any sort of moral panic that might be existing elsewhere in civil society			2
' we should n't be finding ourselves in a situation where people are receiving wildly different sentences for offences that seem on the facts to be relatively similar			1
i mean that 's just not justice			0
' he added that within the riots and looting there was a range of offences being committed			1
he explained that someone who was not at the scene and received a small amount of low value property later was guilty of a far less serious offence than someone who smashed a shop window , stole property and then set the place alight			0
he said : ' i think those differences need to be clearly reflected in sentencing , ' @entity15 added that there was the risk of a ' collective loss of proportion ' , saying that some sentences look ' very severe ' and ' appear out of kilter with each other '			1
there has been criticism over the sentencing of @entity83 , 20 , and @entity84 , 22 , who were both jailed for for creating riot @entity86 pages a 16 - year - old boy from west @entity88 , accused of murdering a pensioner during the riots in the capital , has been refused bail			1
the boy appeared by videolink for a half - hour hearing at the @entity96 so his counsel @entity97 could apply for bail			1
but judge @entity99 refused the application and remanded him in custody to a hearing at the same court on september 9 the youth , from @entity105 , west @entity88 , is also charged with violent disorder and four counts of burglary - relating to looting at a @entity109 bookmakers , a @entity108 , a @entity111 video shop and a @entity113 restaurant			1
he appeared at @entity114 earlier this week with his mother , who was also remanded in custody accused of perverting justice by disposing of the boy 's clothing a man who looted a @entity122 doughnut shop during the riots has been remanded in custody			2

in mitigation , @entity141 told the court @entity126 left prison with just Â£ 4 in his pocket			0
she said : ' he ca n't recall the events because he was drunk but he had expressed remorse			0
' @entity126 is held in custody for sentencing on thursday			0
the pair were found guilty of inciting riots , which never actually happened , and both received lengthy sentences of fours years			2
the judge justified the sentences saying the pair , who pleaded guilty and had no prior convictions , could have caused panic in their home towns			2
@entity15 said new guidelines should be put in place to address sentencing for the riots			0
he said : '' it would be a very good idea if the @entity34 could meet and issue some guidelines for sentencing in this area , ' ' the whole point of guidelines is to achieve consistency and fairness			0
' i think the council should issue guidelines as soon as it can feasibly do so			0
' the @entity34 said it has not been asked by the government to amend existing guidance to deal with future unrest			0
adding : ' were we to receive such a request , it would be considered by the council at its next meeting in line with its normal processes			0
