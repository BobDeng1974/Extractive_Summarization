for years , @entity0 has been lumbered with the scornful nickname 4x4 , for giving birth to four children by four different fathers			1
but the former weather presenter announced today that she has now become a 4x3 after her most recent husband @entity6 adopted her eldest daughter @entity9 , 13			1
@entity0 , 47 , took her whole family to @entity11 earlier this month to witness a judge hand over a certificate officially naming @entity6 as @entity9 's father			1
we rushed home to tell @entity9 , who was so happy			2
' it is hard to put into words what this means to us , now @entity9 has someone who has truly earned the right to be her father			2
' you can never expect someone to love your children unconditionally as you do yourself , but @entity6 does			1
' nothing has changed in our day - to - day lives but deep down there is such contentment , a relief on my part and reassurance for @entity9 , our family is stronger than ever			2
' @entity9 's biological father is the @entity44 hotel boss @entity43 , who @entity0 dated for a short while at the turn of the century			1
@entity0 with her husband @entity6 and three of her children @entity9 ( left ) , @entity50 ( centre ) and @entity52 ( right ) but just days after @entity9 was born in november 2000 , the businessman told his girlfriend that he was leaving the @entity55 to find work abroad - @entity0 had n't even taken their child home from the hospital by then			1
when four years later , @entity0 met her current husband @entity6 , the @entity62 advertising executive raised @entity9 as if she were his own			1
but until now , the family have n't seen fit to make the relationship legal			0
the wheels only started to be put into motion when the teen approached her mother last autumn and asked if she thought @entity6 would be interested in adopting her			0
according to @entity0 , @entity6 was so touched that he started to cry			1
the couple then had to start the exhausting adoption process through social services , that included witness statements , referees , visits to their home and the agreement of @entity9 's biological father @entity79			0
@entity0 with her ex-husband @entity80 and two children @entity52 ( left ) and @entity9 ( centre ) at @entity83 in 2003 then , almost nine months after the procedure began , a judge granted the order and @entity9 now goes by the name @entity88			1
it is a happily ever after ending for @entity0 , who has until she met @entity6 was always unlucky in love			1
in 1990 , she married cameraman @entity91 in 1990 and four years later they gave birth to @entity0 's eldest son @entity52 , now 19 , but the couple then divorced a year later			2
her next serious relationship was with the footballer @entity97 , which ended with him violently assaulting her in 1998 after they started arguing in a bar in @entity101			0
it was soon after this that her romance started with @entity9 's father @entity105 , which ended shortly after @entity0 gave birth			1
@entity0 with her first husband @entity91 and their son @entity52 in 1994 in between this split and meeting her third husband , @entity0 then engaged in a brief relationship with @entity113 while he was manager of the @entity115 football team			2
she then met her second husband @entity80 on the 2002 tv dating show mr @entity117 while presenting the programme and a whirlwind romance saw the pair marry in august 2003 , with their daughter @entity50 being born in 2004			2
sadly , the couple split a year later but @entity80 continues to have a good relationship with his daughter , with @entity0 describing @entity50 as the apple of his eye			2
then finally in 2006 , @entity0 met @entity6 and they were married in march 2008 , with her fourth child @entity129 born three months later in june of that year			1
while the tv star has now spoken of her joy that her daughter @entity9 has been officially adopted by @entity6 and announced that she is now a 4x3 instead of a 4x4 , she has always been very outspoken about the attitudes the general public has to her family situation			1
a heavily - pregnant @entity0 at party in @entity137 in november , 2000 with her then boyfriend @entity105			0
he left her shortly after she gave birth to their daughter @entity9 a month later she told @entity141 in 2011 : ' being labelled a 4x4 does not bother me in the slightest , but the chances are you are not going to believe me			1
' truth is , when it first emerged that i was expecting my fourth child by as many men three years ago , i had to admit to myself that the branding was not only innovative but rather apt. ' it rolled off my thick skin like water off a pregnant duck 's back			0
' ( but ) many cruel jokes and jibes later i am still questioning why my domestic situation has been the subject of so much vitriol and disapproval			0
' after all , plenty of men - many of them famous - father children by a host of different women , and they are treated like loveable , if randy , old goats			0
' but women like me , whose romantic dreams may have fallen apart - but who work ferociously hard to provide stable loving homes for their offspring - are vilified			0
' functional , beautiful , well - adjusted children can come out of broken situations			0
and in my case it is thanks to the contributions made by the fathers who take the same responsibility as i have			0
so please save your criticism of the women who love and nurture their children and direct it at the men who fail to be fathers and prefer , instead , to play @entity189 once a month			0
i have four fantastic children with three fantastic fathers			0
and in the words of @entity195 , if he would n't mind re-writing his song , ' three out of four ai n't bad ... '			0
