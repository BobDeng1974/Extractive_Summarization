they are known for being aggressive predators , willing to attack and kill humans			2
but as this picture shows , brown bears are also ever so slightly vain			1
this young bear was caught out gazing at its own reflection in a @entity8 lake curious : this brown bear appears transfixed by its own reflection in a river in @entity13 , @entity8 vain : @entity15 - based photographer @entity14 was hidden just yards away as the brown bear admired itself interested : the bear repeatedly stared at itself as it wondered around the lake these pictures show the brown bear repeatedly stooping to stare at himself , unaware that photographer @entity14 is hiding just yards away			1
she captured the pictures in @entity13 , eastern @entity8 , where there is almost 24 - hour daylight during the summer months			1
the 37 - year - old from @entity15 said : ' it totally felt like a dream			2
it was almost difficult to see where the reflections were starting			0
' the bear turned up at around midnight			1
he came very quietly along the water 's edge looking for food			0
' it was a fairly young bear , perhaps two or three years old			1
he was very cautious as at this age he 'd need to be careful about females with cubs , and older males			0
impressive : with the stillness of the water and the woods around the bear , this image could be a painting funny : the photographer said the bear appeared to keep looking at his reflection as he made his way around the water 's edge youthful : it is thought the curious bear is only about two or three years old ' he seemed to look at his own reflection - as he stayed in the same place for a while			2
' miss @entity14 said when the bear began moving around the edge of the lake he continued looking in			1
' it really was quite amusing to see - and then he was gone , ' she said			0
' the conditions were absolutely perfect for this kind of image			0
on guard : the bear stands to attention as he plays on the water 's edge @entity76 : despite it looking like the middle of the daytime , these pictures were actually taken close to midnight going home : after admiring himself for a while , the bear decides enough is enough and heads away from the lake ' the reflections were perfectly still and the line between the reflections and actual trees being reflected created very little blur			1
' i had actually gone out with the intention of taking a different image			0
i was hoping to see bears bathing and splashing in the water but instead , this happened			0
' but it did n't turn out too bad , did it ? '			0
