@entity0 knows when it became obvious @entity3 ’s presence at @entity4 became an obstacle to his dream of playing in next year ’s @entity7 — prompting him to sign for @entity8 18 months ago			1
‘ it was when i was n’t playing , ’ he said this week			2
‘ i was getting in the 23 but only getting five minutes here and there			0
there were a run of games where i hardly played and just did a hell of a lot of training			2
‘ i just felt to progress i needed to play			0
@entity18 was playing quite well at the time but i felt there were opportunities throughout that couple of years where i felt i could have been given more of a shot			2
@entity8 's @entity0 left @entity4 last year because he was n't getting picked ahead of @entity3 flood has now moved to @entity24 and the pair will face each other on sunday in the @entity27 the @entity8 fly - half holds no animosity towards flood but felt he had to leave @entity4 for the sake of his career ‘ i probably understand why i was n’t but i made the decision to move to give myself the best chance of playing			1
’ it was a bold decision for a 20 - year - old			2
but it was a decision driven by a desire to deliver on the promise that had already seen the @entity41 - born youngster become the first 16 - year - old to play professional rugby union in @entity44 in 2009 before being named the @entity46 young player of the year the following season			1
but there ’s no inkling of resentment towards @entity3 , who earned the majority of his 60 @entity44 caps during his time at @entity54			1
@entity55 ( right ) has been selected by @entity56 for the @entity44 squad for the autumn internationals @entity0 found opportunities limited at @entity4 due to @entity3 ’s presence , so the youngster moved to @entity8 to boost his chances of an @entity44 call - up			1
@entity64 ( 2010 - 13 ) matches ( starts ) : 26 ( 15 ) points scored : 163 tries : 1 conversions : 19 penalties : 39 drop goals : 1 @entity44 caps : 0 @entity72 ( 2013 - present ) matches ( starts ) : 27 ( 26 ) points scored : 334 tries : 3 conversions : 50 penalties : 70 drop goals : 3 @entity44 caps : 2 ‘ we always kicked together so we spent a lot of time away from team sessions together , ’ said @entity0 , 21			1
‘ i remember in the @entity7 season ( 2011 ) we had a bad losing streak			0
@entity3 came back from @entity84 and we sat down and had a good chat about my performances			2
‘ he kept emphasising that i just had to go out and be myself , prepare well and have confidence in myself			0
everything else will take care of itself			0
do n’t stress too much			0
he was very much a calming influence			0
’ the advice has paid off as richly as @entity55 ’s move to @entity8			1
this week — with @entity3 unavailable for selection after moving to @entity24 in @entity94 in the summer — the @entity95 was selected as one of three fly - halves alongside @entity98 and @entity99 in @entity44 ’s 33 - man squad named by head coach @entity56 for next month ’s @entity102 autumn series			1
with @entity98 inked in as first - choice for next year ’s @entity7 , and @entity55 still without an international start following his late withdrawal with a shoulder injury from the summer tour to @entity84 , it is inconceivable he wo n’t be handed a lead role in at least one @entity110 next month			1
a strong showing on saturday for the @entity112 against @entity24 and his former club rival in the @entity27 at the @entity114 would be the perfect way for the youngster to sign off before the autumn tests			1
@entity55 is pictured here back in 2012 playing for @entity4 before he left @entity4 to join current club @entity8 flood is unavailable for @entity44 selection after his move to @entity94 side @entity24 this summer ‘ i did n’t think i could be any more hungry , ’ he said			1
‘ but to miss the tour , and be sat there at home in a sling watching the three tests , it really made me realise how much i want to get to that level and come back in the summer , try to train as hard as i can and get my shoulder as fit as i could and start the season as well as i could at @entity8			1
‘ i obviously want to be playing at that level and do everything i can to try to get there			2
i do n’t know too much about international rugby yet — but i can only find out by playing			2
i definitely feel that if @entity56 gives me a shot i ’ll be ready			0
’ their impressive start to the @entity141 campaign , which has seen them chalk up 22 tries in six games , has convinced @entity145 that @entity55 is not the only @entity8 player ready			1
the @entity44 head coach named no fewer than seven in his squad with @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 all starting on saturday as the @entity155 face one of the biggest games in the club ’s recent history			1
back in 2011 , @entity55 celebrates beating @entity94 at the @entity160 in @entity161 @entity163 misses out with a rib injury while @entity44 under 20 international @entity165 , normally a lock , faces a baptism of fire as he makes his first start for the club , at no 8 against @entity24 ’s star - studded international back - row of @entity172 , @entity162 and @entity173			1
@entity8 ’s back - to - back defeats at @entity175 and last week away at @entity176 , in their opening @entity7 clash , have put even more emphasis on saturday ’s game against the four - time tournament winners			1
‘ we had some honest meetings on monday when a lot of good things were said , ’ @entity0 admitted			2
‘ a lot of people put their hands up and said it ( the @entity176 performance ) was unacceptable			0
we need to turn that around and quickly			0
the intensity of the training session we had on tuesday was brilliant			0
‘ it was n’t meant to be a full contact session but it turned out a bit like that because of the reaction we need and the intensity we need to get to at the weekend			0
people were on the edge			0
we need to be like that against @entity24			0
the game has been built up and rightly so			0
we have n’t played a game this big for three or four years at the club			0
it is a massive challenge but we will give it our all this week			0

@entity8 take on @entity4 at the @entity114 in the @entity27 on saturday
the match pits @entity0 against fellow no 10 @entity3
the pair played together at @entity4 but @entity0 left to join @entity8 last year to get more playing time
@entity3 left @entity4 to join @entity8 this summer
@entity55 has been selected in @entity44 squad for the autumn internationals
