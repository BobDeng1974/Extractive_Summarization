by @entity0 published : 05:56 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 05:57 est , 19 august 2013 doctors may one day use eye tests to detect the very early stages of alzheimer ’s disease , according to new research			1
non-invasive retinal testing is now being trialled and could help flag up the condition by alerting doctors to the presence of amyloid plaque deposits , a known marker of the disease			1
testing could mean that patients are diagnosed or are at least flagged up as high - risk up to 20 years before noticeable symptoms begin , helping patients get treatment before memory loss develops			2
a simple eye test ( library photo pictured ) could soon be available that detects deposits at the back of the eye to assess the likelihood of a person developing @entity27 's			2
around 800,000 people in @entity29 suffer from @entity27 's and other forms of dementia experts generally accept that amyloid plaques - a type of protein deposit - in the brain are a key marker of the disease			1
neurologists have also long believed that there is a correlation between the amount of amyloid in the eye and amyloid in the brain			2
the arguement for this is strong because the retina is formed from the same tissue as the brain when a foetus is developing in the womb			0
to confirm this theory , two tests - the @entity54 by @entity55 and the @entity56 by @entity57 - have been developed and trials are underway , according to a report by @entity60			1
‘ ocular exams through the years have attempted to diagnose @entity27 ’s at an early age , ’ dr @entity61 , a primary care optometry news editorial board member , said			0
the condition is characterised by amyloid plaques in the brain ( pictured in tissue sample ) ‘ we have looked at [ various methods of testing , including ] optic nerve cupping , pupillary response to tropicamide dilation and ocular muscle movement			1
' while all have been investigated , all have failed to withstand the test of time in terms of sensitivity and specificity			0
' professor @entity82 , chairman of the @entity83 at @entity84 in @entity85 , and co-founder of @entity55 , said that with most people , if they ’re going to get @entity27 ’s , they begin to develop the hallmarks , such as amyloid deposits , in their 50s			1
‘ the key for having an effective treatment for @entity27 is early detection			0
you want to prevent those brain cells from being killed or dying in the first place , ' he told the journal			0
the @entity56 works by measuring the amount of photons - light ' particles ' - captured when scanning the eyes			1
the amount of photons captured directly correlates with the amount of amyloid in the eye , explained @entity109 , medical director of the @entity110 at @entity111 in @entity112 , @entity113			2
he stated that the @entity56 is currently in phase one of two in clinical feasibility trials and that phase three is expected to begin in 2014			2
around 800,000 people in @entity29 suffer from @entity27 's and other forms of dementia			0
the number of cases is expected to double within a generation			0
there is no cure and existing drugs can only ease symptoms			0
the condition is diagnosed by memory tests and occasionally brain scans			0
however , the disease can only be confirmed by a post-mortem examination , which reveals the presence of a harmful amyloid plaques in the brain .			1

two new tests - the @entity54 by @entity55 and the @entity56 by @entity57 - are being trialled in the @entity138
they work by *monitoring* the presence of amyloid plaques , a known marker of the disease , on the retina at the back of the eye
