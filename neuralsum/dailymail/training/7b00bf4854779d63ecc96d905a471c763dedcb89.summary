bus operator @entity0 flew to @entity2 to recruit 50 new drivers claiming they could not find any suitable @entity6 candidates ' a @entity6 bus operator flew bosses to @entity2 to recruit 50 new drivers despite there being 2.6million people on the dole in the @entity6			1
@entity0 , a subsidiary of the @entity14 state rail operator , claimed it could not find suitable @entity6 candidates to work on routes in central and @entity17			1
the firm went on a massive recruitment drive in former @entity21 country to expand its workforce			0
they claimed that there were ' no suitable ' @entity6			1
but a current employee at the transport giant said he knew a number of friends who had been interviewed for the posts - and turned down			2
' the routemaster will soon be back in the capital			0
what a shame if @entity6 drivers miss out on the chance to drive it , ' the driver , who wished to remain anonymous , told the @entity36 an @entity0 spokesman said : ' in order to supplement recruitment in the @entity6 we held an open day in @entity2 where 51 experienced bus drivers were recruited			1
' we are not aware of any occasion where a suitable candidate has been turned away			0
' the @entity2 drivers , some of whom have already started work , will be paid £ 10.60 an hour for the first two years at which point it will increase to £ 11.50			0
there are currently 2.64 million unemployed people in @entity6			1
critics would suggest that any number of these would have been suitable candidates to drive the iconic buses			0

professor @entity86 , chairman of the @entity77 , said it had led ‘ inexorably ’ to ‘ pro-immigration ’ policies because more migrants will logically expand the economy			0

it follows a contrasting report by the @entity101 which said the number of immigrants coming to the @entity6 had little or no impact on the number of unemployed			1
the @entity77 report found that house prices and rents are being pushed up by the number of migrants coming to the @entity6			2
it added that migrants will inevitably contribute to the demand for public services , commit crime and generate congestion in the same way any increase in the @entity6 - born population would			1
