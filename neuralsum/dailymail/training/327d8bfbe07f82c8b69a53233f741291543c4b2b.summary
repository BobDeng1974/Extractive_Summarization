by @entity0 published : 09:11 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 05:10 est , 20 september 2013 a cobbled path leading to one of the world ’s best - preserved medieval streets is being ripped up and replaced with modern paving after a council said the surface was a hazard to disabled people			1
@entity10 , in an ancient part of @entity12 , will be entirely repaved in a scheme that is costing taxpayers almost £ 500,000 and goes against the advice of @entity16			1
@entity17 said the rectangular cobbles - or setts - and other period stonework should be replaced as they ' cause mobility problems for some people			2
' a cobbled path leading to the @entity24 , one world 's best preserved medieval streets , is being ripped up in @entity12 as part of a £ 500,000 re-development the cobblestone streets of the city are a major tourist attraction and widely regarded as one of the best preserved medieval areas in the world centuries - old human remains from a former churchyard may also have to be removed so the new paving can be laid			1
conservation experts at @entity16 warned that the existing stonework is an important historic feature of the square , which is lined by timber - framed medieval buildings and other listed structures			1
they urged the council not to remove any of the period features , which include old @entity12 stone paving worn smooth by generations of feet in the centre of the square and granite wagon tracks that meanders along one side and into the @entity24 - widely regarded as one of the best - preserved medieval roads in the world and named @entity55 ’s most picturesque street			1
@entity16 emphatically recommended that all existing stonework was kept and restored for sake of preserving the area			1
a spokesman said : ' the square is an important part of @entity12 ’s @entity61 and the setting of numerous listed buildings			2
' in terms of the paving in the area , we gave our view that we would wish to see the retention of all the present @entity12 stone and stone cobbled surfaces , along with the granite wheel tracks and kerbstones			2
' however it seems their pleas for preservation have fallen on deaf ears as the council plows on with modernisation the period stonework would be replaced with new paving because it could be a hazard			1
lost : despite an @entity16 recommendation that all existing stonework was kept and restored , the 75 foot cobbled path and other period stonework is being ripped up and replaced with modern paving aptly named : the cash - strapped council - which recently announced more than 200 job cuts and a 1.9 % increase in council tax - said the work will cost £ 490,000 a council officer said in a consultation document : ' it is proposed that nearly all of the surfacing of @entity10 will be replaced			1
' in this instance it is not practical to extensively re-use existing worn and damaged material , particularly where this surface causes mobility problems for some users			0
' the work is being carried out as part of a ' revamp ' of @entity10 , which @entity17 said needed a ' radical rethink ' in order to make it a ' world - class space			1
' when it is paved over it will be used by street performers and , subject to planning permission , could also be used by alfresco diners completely changing the tone of the historic quarter of the city			0
the cash - strapped council - which recently announced more than 200 job cuts , big cuts to front - line services and a 1.9 % increase in council tax - said the work will cost £ 490,000			1
but councillor @entity127 , @entity128 , remains convinced they are doing the best for locals and tourists			0
he said : ' by transforming @entity10 we are maximising the benefits for residents , visitors and businesses			2
' the square needs quite a radical rethink to make it a world - class space and by carrying out this transformation we are going to provide a much better quality public space			1
' however , one resident at least was less than impressed			0
pictured , the start of the path that is due to be re-developed , the council says the rectangular cobbles known as setts pose an apparent ' mobility ' issue @entity12 is famous for its historic squares and its snickleways - tight alleys between crooked old buildings			1
thousands of visitors flock to the city each year to see one of the best - preserved medieval streets in the world			1
the shambles was named ‘ @entity55 ’s most picturesque street ’ in the 2010 @entity163			0
@entity10 lies at one end of the @entity24 , which was a historic butchers ’ quarter mentioned in the @entity166 and has changed little since around 1400			0
a chapel called @entity169 @entity168 was at the heart of @entity10 until it was demolished in 1937			0
although is not clear when the current stonework in @entity10 dates from the earliest known mention of the church dates from 1268			0
the cobbled path , which was built in the 20th century in a style typical of many @entity12 lanes , marks the old roadway which is visible in photographs from the early 1900s			2
@entity179 , 31 , said : ' people come from all over the world to see @entity12 because it looks like @entity12			0
' it ’s mad to pull up things that give this beautiful city its character , only to replace them with modern paving that looks like anywhere else			1
' campaign group the @entity190 ’ @entity189 said the scheme was a waste of public money and should be scrapped			0
a spokesman said : ' local residents are opposed to this work , as is @entity16 , and you do have to question if the council thinks residents serve them , rather than the other way around			1
' the council should scrap this scheme , save taxpayers ’ money and help preserve one of @entity12 ’s historic squares			0
' archeologists have already been called in after workmen carrying out the resurfacing uncovered the foundations of the @entity210 and possibly the medieval church			0
they said some human remains may need to be moved so the area can be repaved			0
several grave stones dating from the 1700s are currently used as paving slabs and they will be kept , the council added			2
@entity16 said the current layout dates from 1937 and much of the stonework itself is probably older , possibly re-used at the time			2
however , the council said the layout has changed several times throughout the last 100 years and the current layout is not historically significant enough to be preserved			2
work has already begun on the @entity10 scheme and will take 12 weeks			0
the council plans a number of similar projects in other parts of the city centre as part of its @entity229			0
earlier this year , a project to replace 18th century stone setts in the market square in the nearby town of @entity234 with modern block paving was scrapped after uproar from residents , historians and @entity16			1
@entity239 claimed the setts caused difficulties for disabled people but abandoned the plan just a couple of days before work was due to start in january .			0

the path leads to one of the best - preserved medieval streets in the world
the advice re-development goes against the advice of experts at @entity16
it comes as the cash - strapped council axes 200 jobs and cuts front - line services
just months ago a project to replace 18th century market square in nearby @entity234 with modern block paving was scrapped after uproar from residents and conservationists
