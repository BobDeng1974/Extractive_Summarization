most of us would tremble when faced with a venomous spider or a dangerously high cliff edge			0
but one woman has a rare disease meaning she is biologically unable to feel fear			1
the @entity8 woman , known to doctors as @entity10 , has been put into life - threatening situations but remains completely unfazed			1
she did n’t panic at being held at gunpoint and knifepoint – and did n’t even call the police after these attacks			0
she was also nearly beaten to death by her first husband , but never felt scared			0
a @entity8 woman known to doctors as @entity10 is biologically unable to feel the emotion fear , due to a genetic condition which has caused the part of her brain responsible for being scared to waste away when faced with snakes that could be poisonous to her , she is so curious she has to be restrained from touching them			1
while doctors have been studying @entity10 for more than a decade , she has never been interviewed before			2
this is because the team of neuroscientists , from the @entity32 , looking into her condition , said if her identity was made public people could easily take advantage of her			1
so dr @entity38 , of the @entity32 , carried out the interview and passed it on to journalists at @entity42 radio station , to be used in their @entity44 podcast			0
dr @entity38 began by asking @entity10 , a 44 - year - old mother of three , to describe what fear is			1
‘ well , that ’s what i ’m trying to – to be honest , i truly have no clue ’ she replied			0
she said she does remember being scared of a catfish her father had caught when she was a young girl , as she did n’t want it to bite her , but that was the only time she can remember experiencing the emotion			0
and not being scared has led to some hair - raising situations			0
@entity62 – @entity64 disease is a rare genetic disorder			1
scientists have only identified 400 cases since it 's discovery			2
the symptoms of the disease vary greatly from individual to individual			0
they could include a hoarse voice , bumps around the eyes , easily damaged skin with wounds that do n't heal easily			0
other symptoms include dry , wrinkly skin , and a general thickening of the skin and mucous membranes			0
in some cases there is also a hardening of brain tissue in which can lead to epilepsy and other abnormalities , such as a lack of fear , in @entity10 's case			1
the disease is typically not life - threatening and patients do not show a decreased life span			2
when her sons were small she was walking to the shop when a man on a park bench called her over			0
she said : ‘ he grabbed me by the shirt , and he held a knife to my throat and told me he was going to cut me			0
' i told him - i said : “ go ahead and cut me ”			0
and i said , “ i 'll be coming back , and i 'll hunt your ass ”			0
the man let her go , and she went home , but she did n’t call the police after this event , as she did n’t see the danger			0
@entity10 has a rare genetic condition called @entity64 , which causes parts of her brain to harden and waste away , @entity42 reports			1
@entity64 disease has three main symptoms : people with the condition have a hoarse voice , small bumps around their eyes and calcium deposits in the brain			1
these deposits cause parts of the brain to calcify and harden , which can lead to epilepsy or other abnormalities			1
in @entity10 ’s case , almond - like structures called amygdala found deep in the brain have calcified and wasted away			1
the amygdalae are crucial to the human fear response , and so @entity10 is now literally unable to feel the emotion fear			1
normally , in situations that might cause danger , the amygdalae would send signals to the body that would induce symptoms of fear : the heart to start racing and the palms to sweat			0
@entity10 has @entity64 disease , which causes calcium deposits to form in her brain			1
deposits have formed in her brain 's amygdalae ( one of which is pictured in red ) , which are responsible for the fear response but for @entity10 , as this bit of her brain does n’t exist , she does n’t experience these symptoms in situations others would find scary			1
she is also unable to recognise a fearful facial expression on another person			0
doctors note this is an isolated defect : she has normal intelligence and feels other emotions such as joy , sadness , anger in the same way as others			1
scientists have identified only about 400 people worldwide with @entity64			1
@entity32 scientists were able to induce fear in her in 2013 , when they made her inhale carbon dioxide			0
even at low concentrations , if the amygdala detects carbon dioxide in the body , it normally triggers fear and panic as it is a sign of possible suffocation			2
scientists predicted that @entity10 would n’t panic after inhaling the gas , but in fact , she did			2
professor @entity191 , a neuroscientist at the @entity32 who has been studying @entity10 , says what is remarkable about her is that her lack of fear means she has no traumatic memories			1
when faced with poisonous snakes that would make most people shiver with fright , @entity10 is so curious she has to be held back from touching them			2
she has also been held at knifepoint , at gunpoint and nearly been beaten to death			0
her genetic condition meant she did n't feel scared in these situations and has no bad memories if bad events happen in @entity10 ’s life , they are not registered as bad or threatening , and she does n’t experience them as such , he said			1
even if her husband almost beat her to death , the memory is not traumatic , and leaves no ' emotional footprint ' which could cause psychological problems for others			0
‘ if you have no fear , more terrible things will happen to you , but you do n't personally experience them as terrible , ’ professor @entity191 told @entity42 journalists			2
‘ if you have a lot of fear , fewer bad things are likely to happen , but it 's very probable that your life is more painful to you			2
so is it better to be fearful or fearless ? ’ scientists are now looking into whether @entity10 ’s case could help others with traumatic memories , such as soldiers with @entity238 , according to @entity239			1
finding treatments that could dampen down the activity of the amygdala could help people with @entity238 , researchers believe .			2

woman , known as @entity10 , has been studied by neuroscientists for *15* years
has @entity64 disease , which has caused parts of her brain to harden
her amygdala - which are crucial for the fear response - have wasted away
only 400 people worldwide have been identified with the condition
has a normal *iq* and feels other emotions in the same way as others
traumatic events like being attacked do n't leave her with bad memories
researchers believe her case could help develop treatment for ptsd
