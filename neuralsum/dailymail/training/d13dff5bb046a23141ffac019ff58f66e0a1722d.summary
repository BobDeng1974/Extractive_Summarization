as autumn sweeps in , so too do spiders hoping to cosy up in warm corners of your home as they search for a mate			0
and this year , experts have warned that these eight - legged creatures have got even bigger due to a mild summer and plenty of prey			1
now scientists have created an app to help arachnophobes better understand the larger - than - usual creatures that are invading their homes			1
the @entity19 in @entity21 app , for @entity22 and @entity23 , provides information and photos on the 12 most common spiders the @entity19 in @entity21 app , for @entity22 and @entity27 , provides information and photos on the 12 most common house spiders			1
this includes the rare spitting spider , a pale straw yellow arachnid with black markings and an extremely large domed head			1
its method is unusual , in that it constructs no web and moves extremely slowly and it is only seen in older houses and rarely active in the daytime			0
its enlarged head contains a set of modified poison glands that have evolved to produce a sticky glue			0
this is fired at the spider 's prey , pinning it to the ground			2
the app , created by @entity51 and the @entity52 , also helps users to identify whether the spider 's sex			2
a common spider is the @entity57 , or ' jumping spider ' ; often found on the walls of houses			1
the jumping spider is easily recognised by its squared off head and two very large eyes that almost fill its ' face ' professor @entity65 from the @entity51 said : ' by eating flies and other insects , spiders are not only providing us with a pest control service , but are important in ecosystems			1
spiders are growing far larger in the city than in rural environments , researchers have said			2
they found that rather than thriving in areas with lots of vegetation , golden orb weaver spiders living in urban areas of @entity81 , @entity82 , were larger and had more babies			2
@entity84 said an abundance of food and city lights could be to blame			0
' city - dwelling orb - weaving spiders grow larger and could produce more offspring than their country cousins our research shows , ' said @entity94 of the @entity95 , who led the research			1
this study shows invertebrates are sensitive to urbanisation but that not all species are negatively affected by living in cities			0
' they often feed on the most common species , preventing a few species from becoming dominant			0
a more common spider is the @entity57 , or ' jumping spider ' ; often found on the walls of houses			1
the jumping spider is easily recognised by its squared off head , and two very large eyes that almost fill its ' face '			1
it has the best vision of all of the spiders : seeing as well as we do and often looking up to examine humans			0
unlike in most mammals , female spiders are often larger than males			2
the app , created by @entity51 and the @entity52 , also helps users to identify whether the spider 's sex			2
males are readily distinguished from females because males have what look like a pair of long thin ' boxing gloves ' protruding from the front of their head end			0
these pedipalps , often just called palps , are used to transfer sperm into the female			0
experts have warned that we 'll be seeing more large spiders in our homes in the coming months			2
one of the spiders featured is the rare spitting spider , a pale straw yellow arachnid with black markings and an extremely large domed head ( pictured ) the mild summer has meant the eight - legged creatures have had plenty to eat , and very few have perished			1
with temperatures set to fall , experts from @entity95 have said the larger - than - usual house spiders will be heading indoors in the coming weeks to find a mate			1
mr @entity156 of the @entity157 told the @entity158 that people often notice larger spiders this year as the cold weather drives them inside , with males hunting for females			0
but he agrees that the particularly mild summer we 've had , not too hot and not too cold , will have given spiders access to more prey			1
' so they are appearing a little bigger than average perhaps , ' he says			0
he explained that there is a maximum size that most spiders reach , and its unlikely spiders in the @entity174 will surpass this			2
experts say larger - than - usual house spiders will head into @entity174 homes soon			1
professor @entity65 of the @entity51 said that the mild summer meant that more prey was available than usual			1
this means more spiders could grow to a larger size however it may be that there are a larger quantity of large spiders , rather than a select few spiders being abnormally large			0
' i think it 's more a situation where they are active this time of year , ' he continues			0
' people are seeing them when they are obvious , and there might be more of them because last winter was quite mild			0
' the conditions have been better so there may be more around , and it 's just the fact people are seeing them more and being aware of them more			0
this is particularly the case for house spiders			1
' a mild summer has given spiders more prey than usual ( pictured is an @entity19 spider spinning a web )			1
spiders often head inside at this time of year as males hunt for females			0
but professor @entity65 said there is nothing to fear because they are a ' free pest control service '			0

' spider in @entity21 ' app has information on 12 common house spiders
this includes rare spitting spider , false *widows* and the jumping spider
experts say larger - than - usual spiders are now heading to @entity174 homes
this is due to mild summer and more prey was available than usual
