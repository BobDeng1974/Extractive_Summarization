throughout his time at @entity2 , @entity0 would frequently reference his years under @entity3 and compare them to a ‘ @entity6 education ’			1
it probably does n’t bode well for the apprentice - turned - rival that @entity3 has made a habit of schooling @entity10 in league fixtures as well			1
nine @entity13 meetings and seven wins			1
it is a match @entity3 simply loves ; an occasion that has often drawn his sharpest comments and biggest wins			1
it is also a fixture , when set away from league competition , that has brought some of his biggest lows			0
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity3 face up again at @entity25 on saturday afternoon @entity3 tries to keep the ball from @entity27 as last season 's clash at @entity25 hots up @entity10 threw away the @entity13 title against the @entity31 in this fixture last season @entity3 beats his chest at @entity25 last season and ( right ) some unheeded advice from a young @entity10 fan two @entity38 semi-final defeats in his first spell at @entity40 and one monumental , enduring tantrum about the @entity43 ghost goal of 2005			1
those nights ensured his relationship with @entity46 is perhaps as stormy , if not worse , than the one he shares with @entity48			0
they are fixtures that have helped @entity3 ’s legacy in @entity52 , both through results and deeds			1
it is a fixture that has already left a stamp on @entity0 which might yet be crucial to the story of his career			1
that april day last season when @entity27 slipped and @entity59 sauntered through ranks as one of the most dramatic in recent @entity13 history			1
@entity10 were heading towards the most improbable of titles ; gerrard the most spectacular of twilight glories ; @entity0 the garlands that come from transforming a team ( albeit with the incredible benefit contribution of @entity68 )			1
but the @entity10 captain slipped			1
@entity0 lost twice against @entity3 in that campaign – his first two games in the opposite dugout to the man who once mentored him in his roles as academy and reserve - team coach at @entity40			1
in an interview with @entity78 while he was at @entity2 , @entity0 said : ‘ @entity3 was simply a wonderful influence on my career			1
he could n’t do enough to help a hungry young coach			0
captain @entity27 slipped to allow @entity40 's @entity59 to run through and score the opening goal the result meant skipper @entity27 still has n't won a @entity13 title while at @entity10 @entity86 after the 2005 league cup final , which @entity40 won played 18 won 9 drawn 4 lost 5 * record in all competitions ‘ he was always interested to hear my opinions and to share his			1
as a young coach , you are forever indebted to people like that , who become such an influence on you			0
’ by then , @entity0 was speaking with the perspective of a man who had suffered bad , chastening times in management			2
when he finally left @entity40 after four years in 2008 , he took his first management job at @entity105			2
he did reasonably well , but upset supporters by leaving after seven months to join @entity107 , where he had coached prior to working at @entity108			0
he lasted six months before getting sacked at @entity107 and entering the wilderness			0
‘ i found it very hard to get work , ’ he told @entity78			0
‘ i spent days writing my thoughts down in notepads , not a laptop , trying to learn from the experience			0
i like to think in ink			0
‘ but it was a hard time			0
’ he went on to @entity2 and the rest is history			0
but it is also that background that will give him a measure of perspective when handling the pressure of this fixture against @entity40 and @entity3 at @entity25			1
the questioning of his judgement has never been greater than this week , having drawn enormous criticism for his team selection against @entity129			2
@entity130 taps home the second goal in front of @entity40 's travelling supporters at @entity25 @entity10 were not hammered , but by stacking his cards in favour of domestic matters against @entity40 , @entity0 can not afford a bad defeat			1
if he wins , he will claim a measure of vindication for not setting his best side in a marquee fixture in @entity142			0
if he loses , he will doubtless be pilloried			0
to think , a ‘ ghost goal ’ could determine whether he is seen as genius or fool			0
@entity3 , as one so well versed , knows the fine margins			2
those @entity38 defeats against @entity10 came via a disputed @entity43 goal and a penalty shootout			2
to his mind , they are a large reason he has two @entity38 wins rather than four			0
perhaps that goes some distance to his explaining his relationship with the club from @entity25			0
he caused controversy in february 2005 when a @entity27 own goal pulled @entity40 level in the @entity160 final			2
@entity3 held his finger to his lips , an apparent taunt towards the @entity10 fans though later explained as a message to the press			1
whatever the motive , @entity3 was sent off as @entity40 won 3 - 2			1
@entity0 ( right ) looks up to @entity3 after coaching under him while at @entity108 but @entity3 has a tumultuous relationship with a few in football - here keeping the ball from @entity27 @entity3 ’s career is littered with such clashes of personality			1
with @entity0 , the relationship has remained good and affectionate , even if there have been barbs since the dynamic changed and they became rivals			2
last season , after @entity27 ’s slip , @entity0 accused @entity40 of ' parking two buses ' and said it was ' not difficult ' to coach a team to defend			1
it was unsporting from a decent man and @entity3 was n’t impressed			2
the @entity185 took a minor swipe this week at @entity0 ’ selection to face @entity129			1
reflecting on april 's win , @entity3 said : ' it gave the title to @entity191 , simple as that			2
@entity10 , with a point in that match , would have been champions			2
without it , they lost the title			0
it meant nothing to us			0
after our defeat against @entity202 , that match meant professional pride			0
we were not in the race			0
’ and on the rivalry goes			0
on such sub-plots , the @entity13 has always thrived			2
with @entity40 on an unbeaten season and @entity0 facing significant questions , the table is set for another big meeting			1
like @entity212 's facebook page .			0

@entity10 host @entity40 in the @entity13 on saturday *lunchtime*
@entity3 has only lost once against the @entity216
@entity0 needs a result after resting players at @entity129
