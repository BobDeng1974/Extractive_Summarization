he cut his thumb and damaged a tendon , which had to be repaired by surgeons under general anaesthetic			0
file picture lawyers for the family said the school had not carried out a proper risk assessment before installing the water fountain and claimed that @entity17 ’s injury was the result of negligence or breach of duty			1

@entity78 , for the council , said schools might have to ban the fountains if @entity17 was allowed to keep his pay - out , for fear of other potential claims			1
he told the court that schools could never be completely free from hazards			0
‘ any part of the premises , for example the corner of a brick wall , could be perceived as sufficiently sharp to cause a laceration if punched , ’ he said			0
