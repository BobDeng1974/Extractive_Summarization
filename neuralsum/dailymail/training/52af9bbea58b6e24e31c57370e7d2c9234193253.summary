by @entity0 for @entity1 a fall off a faulty chair , taking a tumble on a wet floor , struggling to get in and out of a car and being bitten by a dog			1
it might sound more like the plot for a comedy film - but in fact , these bizarre occurrences are some of the compensation claims made by a single police force to its officers in the last year			1
@entity15 had to fork out nearly £ 600,000 on personal injury claims brought by 26 officers			1
@entity19 police officers were awarded almost £ 600,000 in 26 personal injury claims ( stock photo ) the officers were successfully awarded compensation for a string of injuries , including a fall off a faulty chair , dog bites and one who was hit by a car park barrier			1
another got a pay - out after he was clobbered by a colleague with a baton who was trying to break a car window with it			1
a further three officers were injured by their colleagues while on a job			0
the biggest claims relate to officers who tripped and fell at work			2
three officers slipped on wet floors , two sustained injuries after moving furniture , one tripped in a ' dark corridor ' and another tripped in a ' hole in the office floor '			0
somewhat ironically , three officers were also hurt during their personal safety training			2
other payouts were for an officer suffering from an asbestos - related disease and one who developed stress from being exposed to @entity58			0
in total , £ 328,100 was paid in compensation to officers , while a further £ 260,900 was handed out to lawyers dealing with the 26 cases			2
some of the unusual compensation claims made by officers took place in the @entity67 ( pictured ) , including officers who slipped on wet floors , or tripped on a hole in the office floor last year , it was revealed that a @entity19 officer received nearly £ 8,000 in compensation after being bitten by fleas while at work			1
in march this year , a @entity78 request found that police officers who suffered an injury at work had claimed as much as £ 85 million in compensation in the last five years			1

the other claims included one who received £ 16,610 for tripping over blankets while chasing a criminal , one who got £ 43,000 for a back injury after a slip on ice and another who was paid £ 8,130 for falling over some photocopy paper			1
critics denounced the figures and said that money on policing could be spent more usefully elsewhere			2
@entity15 have made £ 126 million of cuts since 2010 , and is expected to make £ 23 million of savings in the current financial year			1
@entity106 , from the @entity107 , said : ' these figures are shocking			1
' either the force is failing to deliver a safe working environment , or they 're paying out on spurious claims , but either way it 's taxpayers that end up footing the bill			0
' every penny spent on compensation is a penny that ca n't be spent on fighting crime and anti-social behaviour , and this pay - out culture can not be allowed to continue			1

he said : ' police officers face dangerous situations on a daily basis while on duty , protecting people from harm			0
' this is a fundamental nature of the job and a reality accepted by @entity15 officers and staff , whose health and safety we take extremely seriously			2
' the force , together with unions and staff associations , have a robust joint delivery health and safety plan , which has led to a reduction in accidents involving officers of 7.5 per cent over the past year			0
' we are responsible for our employees when they are on duty and when we fall short of meeting that responsibility , they are entitled to protection under the law and seek redress through the courts			0
' compensation payouts are only made following the assessment of appropriate medical evidence by our legal team , insurers and solicitors , who then make a recommendation to the force as to what payment should be made			0
' not all claims have however been successful or been pursued			0
