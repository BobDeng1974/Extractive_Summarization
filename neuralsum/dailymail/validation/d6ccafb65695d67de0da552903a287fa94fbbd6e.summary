@entity0 scored a famous @entity2 winner as @entity4 's strongarm tactics backfired ahead of their big date in the @entity6			1
@entity7 was bouncing as @entity0 lashed home a poor clearance from returning @entity4 captain @entity10 after 61 minutes			1
and @entity12 's men – who sent on £ 50million substitutes @entity14 and @entity15 to try and salvage the game – were lucky to survive with 11 men after bad challenges from @entity19 and @entity20			1

the hosts are now playing without any recognised strikers			0
91 mins : oh wow , what a huge moment in the match			0
@entity60 charges into the @entity2 box and falls under the challenge of @entity63			1
on first inspection it looked a penalty and the replays suggest so too			0
however the referee decides otherwise and awards a free - kick to @entity2 as @entity71 is fouled by @entity60 during his tumble			1
the @entity4 players are incensed			2
will that moment spell curtains for their title challenge ? there will be four minutes of injury time to be added on ... 86 mins : @entity2 make their first change of the match and it 's a defensive one as striker @entity81 is replaced by @entity82			1
@entity84 's appearance is his 600th in the @entity85			0
only @entity86 has made more			0
82 mins : and that cross is @entity89 's last piece of action as he is replaced by @entity84			2
81 mins : what a chance that was for @entity4 to equalise			2
@entity92 cuts the ball back on the right flank to @entity89			2
the latter whips in a devilish cross that finds the head of @entity19 at the back post			2
the @entity100 international can only head over from just outside the six - yard box though			0
the frustration grows for the visitors			0
@entity4 are continuing to press for an equaliser but have yet to breach the @entity2 defence			1
as they push further forward gaps are starting to appear which @entity2 are beginning to exploit			2
the visitors have simply not been at it tonight , a huge credit must go to the @entity2 though			2
74 mins : @entity12 makes his second change of the match as @entity114 is replaced by @entity15			2

66 mins : @entity4 have just over 20 minutes plus added time to turnaround this scoreline			1
victory for @entity4 would see them close the gap on @entity35 to two - points ahead of their match against @entity125 on sunday			1
a defeat means the @entity127 could go eight points clear if they beat the @entity125			0
do the @entity4 players want it enough ? 63 mins : @entity4 react to conceding the opener by taking off the ineffectual @entity132 and replacing him with @entity14			1
@entity20 ' act of cynicism has been punished spectacularly by @entity2			1
from the resulting free - kick @entity136 's set piece is headed away by @entity4 captain @entity10			1
unfortunately for the defender his clearance falls straight to @entity0 who hits a sweet left - footed volley first time that arrows into the bottom corner			1
60 mins : @entity20 swiftly follows @entity63 into the referees book for a cynical challenge on @entity54			1
58 mins : we have our first booking of the match and it 's a harsh one as @entity149 is cautioned for a challenge on @entity151			1
replays show it was a soft decision in comparison to some of the unpunished tackles that the @entity4 players have dealt			2
55 mins : what a hit by @entity0 - he 's so unlucky			2
the @entity160 international hits a hook volley , with his weaker right foot , over his shoulder that narrowly goes past the post			0
that 's got the crowd engaged			0
51 mins : @entity114 has just produced a collectors item - a bad touch			2
and at precisely the wrong time too			0
@entity19 does brilliantly to spin around a @entity2 defender on the halfway line and race clear			1
with @entity114 in support he plays in the playmaker but his first touch forces him wide with @entity174 bearing down on him			1
that could , and probably should have been , 1 - 0 to the visitors			0
will the deadlock be broken in this stalemate ? a @entity4 fan has just proposed to his @entity2 - supporting girlfriend on the pitch at half time			1
thankfully she said yes because it ’s a long walk back to the touchline			0
that ’s the best entertainment we ’ve had here so far			0
disappointing first half from the champions			0
surely they have n’t got one eye on @entity40 when there ’s still something to play for in the title race			0
@entity4 showed a few flashes towards the end of the first half but @entity174 has only had two saves to make , and fairly routine saves at that			1
and the referee has drawn a close to first half proceedings at @entity7			0
in truth it 's been a rather drab affair with no clear - cut chances yet created for either side			0
the hosts will be pleased with their display so far as they aim to avoid relegation , but @entity4 know they have to improve if they are to keep their hopes alive of retaining the @entity85 title			2
42 mins : city are dominating possession now and the stats support that with 70 per cent of the ball in their favour			0
however , the key statistic is that it is still 0 - 0			0
can they make their dominance count ? 34 mins : the visitors are slowly starting to come into the game more			0
@entity132 wriggles free inside in the @entity2 box but is tackled before he can shoot			1
the ball falls into the path of @entity19 who chooses to shoot rather the cross			2
the end product ? an effort well wide of goal			0
nevertheless a warning sign for the hosts			0
29 mins : it 's taken nearly half an hour but finally a keeper is forced into a save			0
@entity174 comes off his line well to deny @entity132 from squeezing in a near post effort			1
from the resulting build - up the goalkeeper holds the ball well from an @entity19 strike			2
as the old saying goes , you wait ages for a bus and then two come along at once			0
26 mins : and that trend continues as @entity248 drags an ambitious left - footed shot well wide of @entity174 's goal			2
23 mins : the fans have little to cheer about so far and it 's hardly surprising			0
we 're approaching the midway point of the first half and neither side has managed a shot on target yet			0
15 mins : still no clear - cut chances created by either side			0
both goalkeepers have had yet to break sweat			0
10 mins : @entity2 right back @entity136 crosses a ball that hits @entity264			1
the home fans roar for a penalty but replays clearly show the ball hits the left back in the chest			0
6 mins : as you would expect @entity2 came out of the traps strongly in the opening exchanges			2
city have weathered that ' mini-storm ' and are starting to express themselves			0
the match has started in @entity276			0
can @entity2 stun @entity4 ? kick - off is imminent ... look away @entity2 fans ... city are unbeaten in their last six visits to @entity7 in all competitions , winning the last five in a row and scoring 17 times in the last four			1
to make matters the visitors are unbeaten in their last 13 matches in all competitions against the @entity2 ( @entity288 )			2
records are there to be broken though ... in a close battle for the @entity85 title , december 28 2014 could be a date that haunts @entity4			2
leading 2 - 0 at half - time against @entity2 , @entity12 's side squander a two - goal lead to draw with @entity298 's men			1
@entity0 scored straight after the break , turning home @entity54 ' shot while in an offside position			1
then @entity303 reacted quickest in a crowded penalty area to smash home a loose ball to earn the visitors a draw			1
@entity12 knows his side ca n't afford a repeat performance like that if they are to close the gap on league leaders @entity35			0
@entity4 captain @entity10 returns to the starting line - up after being an unused substitute against @entity317 on 4 march			1
quartet @entity60 , @entity264 , @entity319 and @entity248 also start as @entity12 rings the changes			1
right so the @entity2 team news is and @entity322 and @entity81 come in for @entity323 and @entity324 in the only two changes for the @entity2 from the side that lost 2 - 0 at @entity327 against @entity328			1

hello and welcome to @entity24 's coverage of saturday 's late @entity85 kick - off between @entity2 and @entity4			1
both sides are desperate for the three points for reasons concerning either end of the table			0
follow all the action from @entity7 with myself , @entity352 , kick - off is at 5.30pm .			0

@entity0 puts @entity2 ahead with a brilliant low volley on 61 minutes
