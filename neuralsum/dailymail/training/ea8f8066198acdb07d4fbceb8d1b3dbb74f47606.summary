by @entity0 published : 11:46 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 20:07 est , 13 march 2013 @entity1 , 29 , from @entity2 , loved working as a cattle farmer during his 52 - jobs a year challenge a shop manager who decided he wanted to find a career he loved rather than tolerated is trying a different job every week - for a year			1
@entity1 , 29 , made the life - changing decision after he was forced to take time off following an accident at work when a box of metal brackets fell on his head			1
during months of recuperation at home in @entity2 , he realised that much as he liked his colleagues , there must be more to life			2
mr @entity1 told @entity21 : ' i 'd worked in shops ever since leaving college at 17 , and during the time i was recuperating , i just wondered if this was what i wanted to be doing for the rest of my life			2
' i realised i did n't just want to enjoy evenings and weekends - i wanted to enjoy what i did for a living			2
' as i was n't sure what i wanted to do , i thought i would try different things			0
' quite a lot of different things : mr @entity1 decided to try 52 various jobs , for five days each , for the whole of 2013			1
he also thought this would be a good way to earn money for charity , and has vowed to give each week 's pay to @entity44 , which helps disadvantaged young people			1
so far , he has raised more than £ 2,500			1
mr @entity1 , who lives at home in @entity47 , @entity2 , with his father photographer father @entity48 , 57 , mother @entity49 , 55 , and sister @entity50 , 27 , both of whom work in supermarkets			1
he said his family have been supportive of his challenge and hope it leads to him finding a job he will love			0
the jobs have taken him across southern @entity59 , throughout his home county and as far as @entity61 - with temporary employment also offered later this year in @entity63 and parts of @entity65			2
the week mr @entity1 spent working as a stuntman was difficult and painful , but he says he is loving the variety it tooks months of recuperation after an accident to make mr @entity1 realise he wanted to do something else despite having to dip into his bank overdraft and cut back on his usual @entity75 extravagance , the 29 - year - old said he is determined to see the challenge through to the end of the year			1
' it 's tough living on virtually no disposable income , so you can certainly say i 'm giving my overdraft a run for its money , ' he said			0
' but i knew this was going to be tricky when i started , so it has not come as a shock			0
' i 'm trying to cut back personal costs as much as possible , so i am accepting lifts from people and crashing on sofas if i am working away from home			0
@entity94 : @entity1 will be well - placed to choose a career he loves by the end of the year ' there 's a group of mates i have n't seen since this has started and i 'm afraid @entity99 got something a little cheap for @entity101			1
' i 've written my fair share of @entity103 too , but that 's all part of the challenge for me and i am loving it			0
' placements have varied from hard labour to mentally exhausting office roles , and mr @entity1 has also had to spend his free time setting up future placements , travel and living arrangements			0
he said : ' i was a stunt man for a week , which involved a lot of me being used as a padded punch bag			0
it was great fun , but a bit of a relief when the bell went at the end of the day			0
positive attitude : despite having to be the new boy every monday for a year , mr @entity1 is thriving on his challenge exhausting but satisfying : the week he spent working as a cattle farmer was one of mr @entity1 's favourites ' this week i have been working with children with special needs in @entity129 , which has been incredible too , for different reasons			1
' and my time at the @entity44 was completely eye - opening - i have been able to see where the money i have raised is going , and seeing the real - life accounts of people who are genuinely struggling to get by			1
' he says the jobs he has most enjoyed so far have been the outdoor , physical ones - beef - farming and working as a blacksmith left him exhausted but happy at the end of each day			2
he also enjoyed jobs with creativity : ' when i worked as a blacksmith i loved thinking i 'd made a metal gate which might last for years and years			0
' there are still 41 weeks of the challenge left , and potential employers are asked to get in touch if they can help mr @entity1 , who is now in week 11 of his challenge , says even if he finds his dream job , he will finish his challenge before pursuing it			2
' everyone asks what i will do if i find my ideal job early on , but i 've set myself the challenge and i 'm going to stick to it , ' he said			0
' parts of it are hard - showing up somewhere new every monday , always being the new person , and having to get to know people - but i 'm enjoying the discipline and the opportunities this is bringing me , and i feel so lucky to be doing it			0
' mr @entity1 added : ' obviously , all my wages are going to charity , so if there are some high - paying employers out there , i 'd love to hear from them			1
