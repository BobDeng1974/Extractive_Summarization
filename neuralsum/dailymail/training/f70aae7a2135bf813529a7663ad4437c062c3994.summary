' @entity169 , of the @entity172 parenting club @entity170 , believes that , while celebrity - styled or unusual names may be fun , parents know their children will ' probably have an easier ride in the playground if they choose a more traditional name - which is why more conservative names such as @entity1 and @entity2 win out overall '			1

' @entity203 founder @entity202 said : ' baby names are a fascinating snapshot of the country 's culture and , while we 're still wild about @entity1 and @entity2 , this year 's two biggest baby name trends are retro @entity211 - style names and posh becoming common			2
' many mums are looking back into their family tree and selecting great - grandparents ' names , while others are seeking names which would have seemed stuffy a decade ago but fit with the current retro vibe across the @entity172			0
' hit television shows such as @entity221 , which counts former ballerina @entity223 as one of its judges , could also be responsible for boosting the popularity of the name @entity116 , it was suggested			0
odds on : @entity230 is likely to be a contender for top spot next year , as will @entity233 and @entity26 and ms @entity202 felt that reality television show made in @entity235 , starring @entity236 , has ' made posh names popular again '			1
she said : ' @entity110 , @entity113 and @entity117 have leapt into the top 100 and will soon be just as likely to be heard on inner - city estates as the @entity240			2
' the @entity241 have shown it 's possible to move from pit to palace with the right type of name and behaviour , so thousands of parents will be hoping choosing an upmarket name helps their child do the same			0
