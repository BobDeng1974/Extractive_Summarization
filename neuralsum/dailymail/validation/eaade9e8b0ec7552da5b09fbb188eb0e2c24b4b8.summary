teamwork : women munitions workers began making shells and fuses for the first time in this factory in @entity27 , @entity21 , in 1915 posed up : one electrical engineering firm that diversified and began to employ women in 1915 was owned by @entity30 many firms in the @entity32 and elsewhere converted to start making munitions in the war , with women now working alongside men in these jobs			1
and one electrical engineering firm that diversified and began to employ women in 1915 was owned by @entity30 in @entity27			1
the company had previously made meters and transformers , but switched production to fuses and 18 - pounder shells in 1915			1
in the same year , mr @entity30 hired the first female supervisor - family friend @entity45 , who ended up working for the firm for 40 years			1
it was her job to recruit new female workers at the factory , where there were more than 1,000 women working by the end of the war in 1918			1
@entity54 , curator of an exhibition on @entity21 ’s war effort , said : ‘ it was something that had to be done because the men were going off to fight			1
hard work : many companies converted to start making munitions during the war , with women now working alongside men in these jobs getting involved : @entity4 was facing a huge shortage of munitions on the front lines in 1915 , leading to what became known as the @entity69 ‘ but instead of the women coming in and doing the same job that a male skilled worker would do , they broke down the job into smaller pieces			2
' she told @entity77 : ‘ they would have worked on turning the shells and finishing them - making them smoother once they had been manufactured			2

also featuring are images of his daughter @entity123 who worked on the production line at her father ’s factory during the war			2
and there will also be a section on the @entity131 , which received ideas submitted by the public on how to win the war			0
examples of rejected inventions range from training seagulls to defecate on enemy periscopes to mounting machine guns on artificially frozen clouds			0
@entity141 , head of exhibitions at the museum , said visitors will be given an ‘ insightful , original and personal take ’ on the war			0

@entity151 and suffragette leaders volunteered their members to take the place of men in industrial work after they went off to fight in the war			0
