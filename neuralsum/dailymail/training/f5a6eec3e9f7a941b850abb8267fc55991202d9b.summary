haven : ambassador @entity6 and @entity2 were hiding in a safe room which later filled with diesel smoke heroic : former @entity151 @entity150 , right , and @entity70 , left , were killed in a mortar attack attack : four @entity4 citizens died in the raid on the consulate in @entity5 , including mr @entity6 inferno : armed attackers dumped jerry cans of diesel fuel in the building and set ablaze part of the exterior of the consulate 's exterior promise of answers : @entity11 speaking in @entity168 , @entity169 , this week she added : ' and so far , he 's told me nothing			1
and i want to know			0
' i told him , if it 's such a secret thing , fine , take me in another room , whisper in my ear what happened so that i know , and we 'll go from there			1
' but no. no , they - you know , they treat me like - at first i was so proud because they were treating me so nice when i went to that reception			0
' they all came up to me and talked to me and everything			0
i cried on @entity11 's shoulder			1
and he - then he 'd kind of look off into the distance			0
' so that was worthless to me			0
i want to know , for @entity51 's sakes			0
or for @entity194 's sake or whoever 's sake is there			0

' the @entity220 says it never concluded that the attack was simply a protest gone awry			1
meanwhile the investigating committee 's chairman , rep. @entity223 , @entity223 , has accused the @entity220 of turning aside pleas from its diplomats in @entity227 to increase security in the months and weeks before the attack			1
one scheduled witness , @entity230 , the former chief security officer for @entity4 diplomats in @entity227 , told the committee his pleas for more security were ignored			1
@entity220 officials were asked about the administration 's initial - and since retracted - explanation linking the violence to protests over an @entity4 - made @entity239 video circulating on the @entity240			1
one official responded ' that was not our conclusion ' and called it a question for ' others ' to answer , without specifying to whom he was referring			0
the burn - out wreckage following the fires within the @entity4 consulate the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were n't authorized to speak publicly on the matter , and provided no evidence that might suggest a case of spontaneous violence or angry protests that went too far			1
@entity260 presidential candidate @entity72 and @entity260 lawmakers have increasingly sharpened their criticism of the administration 's initial explanation of the attack			1
they said they never accepted the original explanation			0
it was a top administration diplomatic official , @entity271 ambassador @entity270 , who gave a series of interviews five days after the attack that wrongly described the attack as spontaneous			1
she said that the administration believed the violence was unplanned and that extremists with heavier weapons ' hijacked ' the protest against the @entity282 video			1
governor @entity72 pointed the finger at @entity11 's administration for wrongly describing the attack as ' spontaneous ' she did qualify her remarks to say that was the best information she had at the time			1
@entity290 since has denied trying to mislead @entity291			0
a concurrent @entity293 memo obtained by @entity294 cited intelligence suggesting the demonstrations in @entity5 ' were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the @entity298 in @entity299 ' and ' evolved into a direct assault ' on the diplomatic posts by ' extremists '			1
@entity303 , the former security official in @entity227 , addressed the diplomatic security issue in an october 1 email to a congressional investigator			0
he said his requests for more security were blocked by a department policy to ' normalise operations and reduce security resources '			0
a memo on tuesday by the @entity316 's @entity315 staff provided details of @entity303 's interview with the panel 's investigators			0
in that interview , @entity230 said he sent two cables to @entity220 headquarters in march 2012 and july 2012 requesting additional diplomatic security agents for @entity5 , but he received no responses			0
he stated that @entity326 , the deputy assistant secretary for international programs , wanted to keep the number of @entity4 security personnel in @entity5 artificially low			0
he said @entity330 believed the @entity5 facilities did not need any diplomatic security special agents because there was a residential safe haven to fall back to in an emergency			0
@entity303 's october 1 memo to the congressional investigator said : ' you will note that there were a number of incidents that targeted diplomatic missions and underscored the @entity344 's ( government of @entity227 ) inability to secure and protect diplomatic missions			0
' this was a significant part of ( the diplomatic ) post 's and my argument for maintaining continued @entity350 ( diplomatic security ) and @entity352 ( @entity352 ) security assets into sept / oct. 2012 - the @entity344 was overwhelmed and could not guarantee our protection			0
' sadly , that point was reaffirmed on sept. 11 , 2012 , in @entity5			1

@entity16 told @entity26 the @entity19 had not contacted following the first expressions of *sympathy*
her only son @entity62 was killed in the september 11 attack which killed ambassador @entity6
@entity11 administration originally said assault *stemmed* from protests against @entity369 video but then *backtracked* saying terrorists responsible
