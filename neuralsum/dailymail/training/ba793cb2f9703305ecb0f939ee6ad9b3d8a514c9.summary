by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:54 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 02:40 est , 30 november 2012 she may have been left distraught on wednesday when she narrowly missed out on seeing her daughter @entity3 in the jungle , but it was a better day for @entity6 on thursday night 's show			1
the @entity9 actress won a phone call to her daughter as a result of a darts game they played			1
and she was so overwhelmed she gushed at her campmates afterwards , thanking them for letting her take the one call granted to the four of them			0
the aim of the game was to fire a dart to the corresponding number picked out of a bag and the celebrity would get whatever treat was beside that number written on a board , all played in a relay style			0
@entity6 said as she learned about the new challenge : ' it was really handy that we had a darts challenge and we had @entity48 , although his track record through the show has n’t been very good			2
' that smile says it all : the @entity9 actress was selected by her camp mates to use up the one phone call to make up for her disappointment the day before @entity48 was first up and pulled number 10 , he hit double ten with the first arrow which won them one beer			1
next up was @entity62 who managed to hit number 14 on his fourth dart winning some cheddar cheese			0
@entity66 hit number one and won a phone call from home , @entity6 missed the board completely but then it was @entity48 ’s turn again and he hit number nine with his first dart and won coffee			2
meanwhile , @entity62 pulled number eight and hit it with his first dart and won coffee and sugar			0
agreeing that the two phone calls should be combined to make a four minute call , @entity48 said : ' do you think @entity6 should have it as @entity62 spoke to his mum and i do n’t give a s * * t ? ' the others agreed 100 per cent with him and a thrilled @entity6 beamed : ' that will be amazing , thank you guys			2
' overcome : the camp mates had won the chance for two different two minute calls but let @entity6 speak to her daughter for the full four minutes thank you ! she gushed to @entity66 , @entity62 and @entity48 after squealing down the phone for the duration the celebrities had their winnings from the darts challenge delivered , it was cheese , a beer , coffee and sugar			1
they were tucking into the cheese when the phone in camp rang and @entity6 spoke to her daughter @entity3			1
squealing with delight @entity6 was so excited to hear from @entity3 as the youngster screamed down the phone : ' i miss you mummy , you are doing really well , you have lost a lot of weight , i ’ve been watching and i ca n’t tell you how proud i am of you			1
' @entity6 told her how much she loved her and that her handwriting in the letter she sent to camp was really good			1
can he do it ? the camp mates joined in together on a group challenge which saw them try to hit different treats on a board to win them showing them how it 's done : darts legend @entity48 showed off the talents which made him famous as he won treat after treat ' i know you so well and you are a strong woman why did n’t you say we are a strong , independent , motivational , inspirational women ? ' @entity6 answered : ' because we are strong , independent , motivational , inspirational women and i did say it and i think of you every time			1
i love you , you are the best , i ca n’t wait for snuggles and i ’m going to snuggle you so much			0
' @entity3 replied : ' you are the best mummy , you will win it now , i want to be the princess of the jungle ! i love you ! ' having a go : @entity6 also took part to win the remaining four some treats to take back to camp on one of their final evenings @entity6 said : ' you will be princess of the jungle no matter what			1
do you know what the @entity150 score is , do n’t worry i know you ca n’t tell me			0
i love you , love you , love to everyone			0
' after the call @entity6 thanked everyone for letting her take the call and jumped up and down and clapped with glee			2
it was just a day after show producers infuriated viewers by getting @entity3 's hopes up by telling her she could get to see her mum for a cuddle			1
contestants on i ’m a celebrity at least have plenty of warning of the emotional turmoil the challenges of the jungle are likely to present			0
but the @entity170 show reached disturbing new lows when a seven - year - old girl was the one left in distress			1
producers were accused of cruelty after the child was put up as a prize – and had to be consoled when her mother failed to ‘ win ’ her			1
distraught : @entity6 was devastated to learn that she was inches away from her daughter 24 hours earlier so close : @entity6 's daughter was disappointed that she missed out on seeing her mother hundreds of viewers took to social networking sites and internet discussion forums yesterday to complain about the treatment of @entity3 , the daughter of jungle competitor and former @entity9 actress @entity6			1
miss @entity189 had been paired with a fellow contestant , darts champion @entity48 , and given the opportunity to win luxuries by choosing one of five doors to open			0
they did not know that behind the doors the prizes included food , clean clothes – and various members of their friends and family			0
@entity3 , who had been away from her mother for 18 days , was standing behind a yellow door			1
the youngster could hear her mother ’s voice and was heartbroken when miss @entity189 and mr @entity48 picked the wrong colour to reveal a sign which said ‘ game over ’			1
millions of viewers saw @entity3 ’s distress as she realised she would not see her mother and had to be consoled by one of mr @entity48 ’s sons , who was next to her			2
tough blow : @entity6 described learning that her daughter could have been so close was like being ' kicked in the gut ' pulling at the heartstrings : @entity6 was left in tears at the thought of her daughter being so close it was only after learning that two fellow contestants had got to see their loved ones that miss @entity189 , 31 , realised she had missed the opportunity to see her daughter			2
she was left distraught and made a tearful apology to the cameras , saying : ‘ it felt like someone had taken a boot and kicked me in the guts			0
' i did n’t even think having a member of family behind the door would have been an option			0
’ yesterday experts and campaigners called on tv watchdog @entity240 to investigate the decision to involve @entity3 in the contest , which is filmed in @entity243 , while others accused @entity189 of bad parenting for not leaving the jungle to comfort her daughter as soon as she learned what had happened			2
what 's behind each door : @entity6 and @entity48 were first to have a go at the @entity251 game , she did n't know her daughter @entity3 was behind the yellow door end of the line : the pair chose the blue door and were greeted with a ' game over ' sign @entity260 , of campaign group parents outloud , said : ‘ if [ @entity6 ] was genuine about this , she would have got up and walked straight to her daughter and not put her daughter in this position again			1
‘ i find it staggering that [ producers ] have used a child in this way			0
to involve a seven - year - old is sinking to the bottom			1
’ the stunt comes just days after producers were accused of failing to look after comedian @entity272 , 51 , who has battled depression and alcoholism			0
he left the jungle after becoming distressed and was admitted to hospital			0
over the moon : the pair looked delighted to be greeted by their loved ones group hug : @entity282 was seen hugging her daughter while @entity62 was delighted his mother was there to meet him viewers took to the internet to express their outrage at @entity3 ’s treatment			1
one wrote : ‘ for such a small child to hear her mother ’s voice and look so desolate when she did n’t get to see her is n’t sitting comfortably with me			2
’ another agreed , adding : ‘ @entity170 should hang their heads in shame ! ’ @entity296 , a consultant in clinical psychology , said the game amounted to a ‘ high - risk strategy ’ , adding : ‘ some children would be tormented by it			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity170 show said permission for the girl to take part in the game had come from her grandmother , adding : ‘ a senior producer saw @entity3 afterwards and she was fine			0
@entity3 and her grandma come to the jungle every day with the other friends and family , so the experience was n’t as out of the ordinary as it might look			2
’ an agent for miss @entity189 refused to comment on why @entity317 was not at school .			0

former @entity9 actress @entity6 failed to ' win ' her daughter in task a day earlier
