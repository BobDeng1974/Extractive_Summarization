by @entity0 published : 17:28 est , 1 november 2013 updated : 07:57 est , 2 november 2013 a pet rabbit has apparently become the latest victim of false widow spiders			1
only hours earlier one - year - old @entity4 had been hopping happily around the garden			1
but she was found dead in her hutch after it was infested by the poisonous creatures			0
recently false widow spiders have put several people in hospital after biting them and even caused a school to be closed temporarily			2
victim : the body of the pet rabbit , called @entity4 , was found next to a spider 's web with five false widows crawling around @entity4 ’s owner @entity19 found her dead when she went to feed her two rabbits , @entity4 and @entity22			1
when the 21 - year - old removed @entity4 ’s body , she found a hammock - shaped web and up to five spiders scuttling around the hutch			1
after using the internet to identify them as false widows , miss @entity19 became worried for the safety of her 18 - month - old daughter , @entity32			1
she contacted her local environmental health department in the hope of having her home treated for infestation			1
her request was declined , but an officer told her he was 98 per cent certain the spider was responsible for @entity4 ’s death			1
yesterday miss @entity19 , a kitchen assistant , said : ‘ we could n’t believe it when we saw the spiders			2
i was really upset when @entity4 died			2
devastated : @entity19 , 21 , pictured with her 18 - month - old daughter @entity32 and partner @entity45 , was told by an environmental health officer he was 98 per cent certain the pet 's death was caused by the spiders ‘ i really did n’t want the spiders around my daughter			1
we asked environmental health if they could help us , but they refused			1
‘ if it had been a rat , they would have done something , but not with poisonous spiders			0
’ miss @entity19 , who lives with her partner @entity45 and their daughter in @entity63 , @entity64 , has since disinfected the hutch where @entity22 still lives , and killed the spiders she found last weekend			1
venomous : the false widow spider has caused a school to be closed and has left people with horrific injuries after the attack in recent weeks the false widow is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known to be in @entity76 and cases of people being bitten by the venomous creature have been on the rise			2
@entity81 , 66 , from @entity82 , @entity83 , is still recovering a year after a bite that caused his organs to start shutting down			0
bodybuilder @entity86 from @entity87 , @entity88 , required a skin graft when he was bitten in 2011 and has suffered severe reactions to any insect bite since			0
@entity92 , 14 , was off school for three weeks after her knee swelled up when she was bitten in her bathroom in @entity96 , @entity97			0
and last month @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity100 , had to close its doors to pupils after the dangerous spiders were found there			2
the spiders are shiny and black with distinctive cream markings on the abdomen that resemble a horseshoe – or , to some eyes , a skull			0
they have long , spindly legs and are easily confused with the black widow , a far more venomous cousin not found in @entity76			0
as with most species of spider , it is the female false widow which is the force to be reckoned with			0
males tend not to grow much bigger than two centimetres , while females reach up to three centimetres			0
the first false widow is thought to have come to @entity76 from the @entity121 or @entity122 in the 1870s in a bunch of bananas			0
the first recorded sighting was in @entity127 , @entity128 , in 1879 .			0

@entity19 , 21 , found @entity4 's body lying next to a spider 's web
she became worried for the safety of her 18 - month - old daughter @entity32
