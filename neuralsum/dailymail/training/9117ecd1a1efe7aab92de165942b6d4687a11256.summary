by @entity0 @entity2 ’s latest solar observatory has captured footage of the sun belching out a stream of charged particles at 1.5 million miles per hour			1
the curtain of radiation , which erupted on may 9 , was the first coronal mass ejection ( @entity10 ) observed by the @entity11 , or @entity11			1
the footage reveals the @entity10 in ‘ extraordinary detail ’ showing a field of view about five @entity15 wide and seven - and - a - half @entity15 tall			1
material from a coronal mass ejection takes two to three days to reach @entity15 , but in this case , the coronal mass ejection did n't affect our planet			1
coronal mass ejections interact with @entity15 ’s magnetic field to generate auroras and magnetic storms			1
the @entity10 's magnetic fields peel back the outermost layers of @entity15 's fields changing their very shape , distortions which can can degrade communication signals and cause unexpected surges in power grids			1
they also can cause aurora			0
storms are rare during solar minimum , but as the sun nears solar maximum , large storms occur several times per year			2
because the observatory has to position itself a day in advance , it was a stroke of luck that the eruption happened just as the probe was pointing the right way			0
‘ we focus in on active regions to try to see a flare or a @entity10 , ’ said @entity71 , the @entity11 science lead at @entity73 in @entity74			1
‘ and then we wait and hope that we 'll catch something			0
this is the first clear @entity10 for @entity11 so the team is very excited			1
’ during a @entity10 , changes in the sun ’s magnetic fields cause a large section of the surface of the sun to expand rapidly , ejecting billions of tonnes of particles out into space			1
@entity11 must commit to pointing at certain areas of the sun at least a day in advance , so catching a @entity10 in the act involves some educated guesses and a little bit of luck			1
pictured is the solar flare captured by @entity11 ( right ) and the same flare later seen by the @entity99 ( left ) material from a coronal mass ejection takes two to three days to reach @entity15 , peeling back the outermost layers of the planet ’s magnetic field			1
@entity10 ’s can degrade communication signals and cause unexpected surges in power grids			1
however , this @entity10 is not thought to have made a significant impact on @entity15			1
@entity10 ’s often accompany a solar flare – a solar eruption that pushes out waves of light all across the spectrum			1
@entity11 can observe both types of eruption			2
it was launched in june 2013 to study what 's known as the interface region , which is a layer between the sun 's surface the corona that has long baffled scientists			2
solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost			0
astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission			0
they do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks			0
the charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the @entity15 ’s magnetic field			1
very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies			0
a positive aspect , from an aesthetic point of view , is that the auroras are enhanced			0
geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents			0
by capturing light emitted by atoms of different temperatures , @entity11 can looks at different heights above the sun 's surface to analyse this obscure layer			1
the line moving across the middle of the movie is the entrance slit for @entity11 ’ spectrograph , an instrument that can split light into its many wavelengths – a technique that ultimately allows scientists to measure temperature , velocity and density of the solar material behind the slit			2
while the strength of this @entity10 is yet to be revealed , it follows on the heels of the most powerful type of solar flare that ’s ever been recorded by the space agency			1
the huge event on the sun occurred on 29 march 2014 , but @entity2 has only now analysed the data from their fleet of observatories			2
this fleet consisted of four telescopes in space and one observatory on @entity15			2
the flare observed was an @entity186 flare , the biggest and highest - energy solar flares that have ever been observed			0
this close - up of the sunspot underneath the march 29 , 2014 , flare shows incredible detail			0
the image was captured by the g - band camera at @entity194 in @entity195			0
this instrument can focus on only a small area at once , but provide very high resolution this combined image shows the @entity186 flare as seen through the eyes of different observatories			0
the @entity99 is on the left , which helps show the position of the flare on the sun. the darker orange square is @entity11 data			0
the red rectangular inset is from @entity194			0
the violet spots show the flare 's footpoints from @entity213 in particular it was an @entity215 flare , which is the lowest intensity within the @entity217 category but significantly more powerful than the majority of flares			0
coordinated observations like this are crucial to understanding such eruptions on the sun and their effects on space weather near @entity15			2
such research can help scientists better understand what catalyst sets off these large explosions on the sun. perhaps they may even some day be able to predict their onset and forewarn of the radio blackouts solar flares can cause near earth - blackouts that can interfere with airplane , ship and military communications			0
this is an artist 's concept of the @entity11 , or @entity11 , satellite in orbit			0
by capturing light emitted by atoms of different temperatures , @entity11 can look at different heights above the sun 's surface to analyse this obscure layer			2

the huge curtain of solar radiation erupted on may 9 but did n't affect @entity15
it was the first ever coronal mass ejection ( @entity10 ) observed by the @entity11 probe
during a @entity10 , changes in sun ’s magnetic fields can cause a section of the solar surface to expand , ejecting billions of tonnes of particles into space
@entity266 can disrupt communication signals and cause surges in power grids
