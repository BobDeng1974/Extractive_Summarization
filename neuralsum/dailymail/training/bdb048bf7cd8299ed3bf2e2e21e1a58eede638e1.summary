by @entity0 published : 04:02 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 06:35 est , 27 november 2012 the owner of a tiny b&b in the @entity3 has dropped his landmark action against the world ’s largest travel website			1
@entity7 feared he would rack up thousands of pounds in legal bills if he pursued the case against internet giant @entity10			1
mr @entity7 , 64 , launched his historic claim after guests cancelled their bookings on the strength of reviews posted on the website			1
case dropped : @entity7 , @entity19 guesthouse owner in @entity20 , who started legal proceedings against @entity10 disgruntled guests claimed rooms were dirty or cold , and described their host variously as ‘ pompous , arrogant and incredibly rude ’			1
while mr @entity7 accepted genuine criticism , he claimed that some of the reviews were ‘ malicious and factually inaccurate ’			2
and because the @entity30 - owned website refused to remove them , his business was affected and he lost income			0
last month mr @entity7 , who runs the eight - bedroom @entity33 at @entity35 on the @entity36 , began proceedings to sue the organisation , worth around £ 3billion , for a £ 2,000 loss			1
he had initially scored a small victory by winning the right to have the case heard in @entity20 , instead of under @entity30 law as @entity10 wished			2
@entity10 ’s solicitor @entity44 originally wanted the case dealt with under @entity30 law but eventually agreed it should be heard at @entity46			2
picturesque : mr @entity7 's bed and breakfast is located on the beautiful isle of @entity36 he successfully argued it was ' so complex in nature ' that it could only be dealt with by the ordinary sheriff court			2
but mr @entity7 opposed the move - saying it was a tactic by @entity10 to rack up legal costs to a level he could not afford			1
but yesterday his solicitor , @entity59 , confirmed the action had been dropped			0
he said : ‘ mr @entity7 has decided not to pursue it further because of the cost implications			2
it could have cost thousands			0
’ ' we had conversations and an email from the sheriff principal ’s office which made it clear that he did not accept the appeal because he considered the action live in the ordinary court			0
' the only alternative to appeal that decision was a very complex procedure with massive expense			0
' the lawyer insisted that mr @entity7 had been a trailblazer over this - and not least for many others - and has certainly made his point			0
poor reviews : while @entity7 was unhappy with some of the negative comments about his establishment on @entity10 , shown top , his b&b also received positive recommendations on the website , such as the five star review shown bottom sheriff @entity89 admitted he had ' some sympathy ' for mr @entity7 over the time the claim had been in the system - over six months			1
although disappointed at being forced to back down , the guesthouse owner believes it will open a floodgate of cases against @entity10			0
he revealed that he had received over 500 emails , phone calls and letters of support from people - and all but two in favour of his action			0
he said : ' a tiny restaurant told me that they had a bad review posted in february and it had not even opened			0
' i have even had a bad review posted last month which was clearly a fake and claimed that my wife liked a drink was particularly upsetting as she is a pilot			0
@entity10 has now withdrawn that review - but not the reviews of the review			1
' he now hopes that @entity10 victims stand up against false or malicious comments that render reviews untrustworthy - yet have the power to drive hoteliers and @entity82 proprietors out of business			1
internet giant : the case against @entity10 was seen as a landmark one until it was dropped			1

@entity7 had taken the internet review giant to task over negative reviews posted on the @entity10 site
he claims that *customers* cancelled bookings on the strength of the reviews costing him £ 2,000 in business
but he has now dropped his landmark case because legal fees were too high
