aside from the physical impacts brain damage has on the body , the loss of memory can be as devastating and restrictive			1
the @entity5 @entity4 is working on restoring these memories using brain implants that could reverse the loss in wounded soldiers , and benefit @entity11 's and dementia patients			1
although the exact science behind the plans wo n't be announced ' for a few months ' , a medical ethicist has expressed concerns the technology could interfere with a patient 's personality and even their conscience			1
the @entity20 has revealed more details about its memory stimulator			0
its implants will be used to restore memories in wounded soldiers , as well as @entity11 's sufferers , and could involve stimulating the hippocampus , highlighted , the part of the brain involved in processing memories as part of the project , @entity4 hopes to build on neuroengineering advances such as implants already used to treat @entity35			1
it will also draw on the work carried out on monkeys and rodents by @entity39			0
studies have proved neurons in the hippocampus - the part of the brain that processes memory - fire differently when animals see different colours , for example			2
using prosthetics designed to stimulate the hippocampus , researchers were able to extend the short - term , working memory of these animals			0
but to restore a human 's specific memory , scientists would need to know the precise pattern for that memory			2
alternatively , they could restore the brain to work in a way it used to before the injury or damage was caused			2
the brain implant plans were first unveiled in february by @entity5 researchers seeking contributions from relevant drug and technology companies			1
during a conference at @entity73 at the @entity74 at @entity75 this week , project manager @entity71 said : ' if you have been injured in the line of duty and you ca n't remember your family , we want to be able to restore those kinds of functions			0
' we think that we can develop neuroprosthetic devices that can directly interface with the hippocampus , and can restore the first type of memories we are looking at , the declarative memories			0
' but medical ethicist @entity88 said : ' when you fool around with the brain you are fooling around with personal identity			0
' if i could take a pill or put a helmet on and have some memories wiped out , maybe i do n't have to live with the consequences of what i do			0
' as part of the project , @entity4 hopes to build on neuroengineering advances such as implants already used to treat @entity35 , built by @entity103 firm @entity102			1
first lieutenant @entity104 is pictured undergoing cognitive testing at the @entity106 in @entity107			0
it 's estimated more than 280,000 soldiers have some form of brain injury			2
the @entity4 project is a section of president @entity115 's brain initiative , created to fund research to treat common brain disorders brainwaves are pictured on a computer screen			1
@entity4 hopes to develop a device that is portable and wireless and that ' must incorporate implantable probes ' which will both record and stimulate brain activity @entity102 's implant is already authorised for sale in the @entity5 and similar devices manufactured by @entity129 's @entity128 , and @entity130 in @entity131 , are in the process of gaining approval			1
it will also draw on the work carried out on monkeys and rodents by @entity138 , an associate professor at @entity39			0
@entity4 hopes to build on neuroengineering advances such as implants already used to treat @entity35 , including the @entity102 , pictured he has proved neurons in the hippocampus - the part of the brain that processes memory - fire differently when animals see different colours , or pictures of food compared to faces			1
using prosthetics designed to stimulate the hippocampus , @entity138 was able to extend the short - term , working memory of his subjects			0
but to restore a human 's specific memory , @entity138 said scientists would need to know the precise pattern for that memory			2
alternatively , they could restore the brain to work in a way it used to before the injury or damage was caused to improve and develop their memory			1
' the way human memory works is one of the great unsolved mysteries , ' said @entity174 , chairman of neurosurgery at the @entity176			0
' this has tremendous value from a basic science aspect			0
it may have huge implications for patients with disorders affecting memory , including those with dementia and alzheimer 's disease			1
' the @entity4 project is a section of president @entity115 's brain initiative , created to fund research that could treat common brain disorders			1
eventually , @entity4 hopes to develop a device that is portable and wireless and that ' must incorporate implantable probes ' which will both record and stimulate brain activity			2
@entity71 confirmed more details about the plans will be announced ' in the next few months			0

the brain implant plans were first unveiled in february by @entity5 researchers
they are being developed by @entity4
project was set up to restore memories in *people* with brain damage
this includes wounded soldiers plus @entity11 's and dementia patients
exact details are still being developed but it would build on memory studies carried out on monkeys and rats
but *critics* have said *manipulating* memories is ethically wrong
