this is the terrifying moment a skydiver 's parachute opened too early , leaving him just inches away from a deadly tangle with a helicopter 's rotor blades			1
the dramatic footage shows how thrill - seeker @entity7 had been preparing to leap from the helicopter when his parachute became tangled up in the aircraft , thousands of feet from the ground			1
mr @entity7 , 22 , is then seen to desperately hack away at his main parachute before bravely jumping with only his reserve canopy			1
after several frantic minutes , they eventually managed to haul the parachute back into the helicopter , which was then able to land safely			2
@entity7 , from @entity47 , @entity48 , revealed that the equipment he used was rented , and therefore he was unaware who had packed it			1
leap to safety : mr @entity7 is shown jumping using his reserve parachute , with the discarded equipment still tangled up in the helicopter back down to earth : the 22 - year - old 's quick - thinking and bravery has earned him praise throughout the skydiving community desperate : others on board were left trying to haul the loose canopy before it got sucked into the rotor blades his quick - thinking and bravery has earned him praise throughout the skydiving community			1
he said : ' before kitting up i performed all the usual checks including a check on the pin			0
' upon exiting of the helicopter i felt what i thought was a tap on my shoulder but i now assume it was an effect of the risers receiving a tug			0
' i turned round and heard ' what the hell ? ' at the same time as seeing my canopy - it took me a couple of seconds to realise what was happening and what i was actually seeing			0
averting disaster : the footage shows how quickly the crew were able to retrieve mr @entity7 's parachute @entity94 : mr @entity7 said that without the crew pulling the lines in , cutting - away with a reserve line attached would n't have been an option high praise : @entity94 mr @entity7 has hailed the sky diving crew for the speed with which they pulled the canopy back inside the helicopter ordeal : after mr @entity7 jumped from the helicopter it was able to land safely ' i sat there for a couple more seconds , trying to think what options existed , and then was told to just cut it away			1
' after i actually cut away , i shouted ' i 've got to go ' and got confirmation in the form of ' just jump '			2
' watching the video back i 'm so thankful for the crew and their quick reactions and handling of the situation			0
' without them pulling the lines in initially , cutting - away with a reserve line attached probably would n't have been an option			0
' their speediness of also recognising that i had to get out and pulling in the canopy was brilliant			0
' excitement : skydiving mr @entity7 , left , pictured before his leap with fellow thrill - seekers @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 relief : mr @entity7 , pictured with girlfriend @entity134 , said he was ' so thankful ' to the skydiving crew for their handling of the situation			2
