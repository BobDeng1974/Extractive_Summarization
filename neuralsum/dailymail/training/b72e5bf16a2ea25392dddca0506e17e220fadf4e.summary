by @entity0 mother - of - three @entity2 , 36 , is the glamorous face of flat racing on @entity5 it is a tale straight from the pages of a @entity9 bonkbuster			1
a champion jockey cheats on his beautiful blonde wife – a top racing correspondent – with @entity14 ’s best woman jockey , who also happens to be his training partner			1
and , of course , he gets found out			0
@entity2 , the glamorous face of flat racing on @entity5 , was filming away from home when her husband @entity21 invited racing pin - up @entity23 back to the six - bedroom family mansion in @entity25			1
the pair – who both worked with the @entity29 ’s trainer @entity28 – were already close , but this time @entity21 broke the marriage vows he made five years earlier			1
in the horsey set , which is notoriously incestuous and riven with gossip , nothing stays secret for long and @entity2 soon learned of the tryst			1
@entity36 and utterly loyal , she was incandescent at her husband ’s betrayal and demanded a divorce			2
‘ trust is , and always has been , a very big thing for me in my life , ’ she says , sadly , as we discuss the affair over lunch at @entity25			2
‘ if that is broken it is very difficult for me to go back			2
’ so it was understandably distressing when , in the bitter aftermath of the affair in 2010 , she was asked to interview miss @entity23 live on air after a 40 - 1 win ; a request that would strike many as insensitive if not downright astonishing			1
but she point - blank refused to speak to her rival and @entity5 bosses drafted in a replacement at the last minute			1
it was some time before @entity2 conquered this understandable reluctance , but she has since interviewed @entity23 on camera and now says : ‘ post-race interviews are part of my job with @entity5 and that is what i had to keep uppermost in my mind – personal feelings had to be put aside			1
’ someone who is instinctively discreet , it took @entity2 the best part of four years to steady herself in the face of a very public humiliation – and only now is she willing to talk about it			1
@entity2 , 36 , admits : ‘ it ’s true			1
in the aftermath of the affair , i refused to put myself under the spotlight in that way			2
i ’m a very private person and not someone who wants to air their personal difficulties in front of the camera			0
' i wanted to avoid any unnecessary tensions on screen and with my marriage break - up still raw , one of my colleagues stood in for me			2
’ @entity2 ( pictured ) was filming away from home when husband @entity21 invited racing pin - up @entity23 back to the couple 's six - bedroom family mansion in @entity25 , @entity97 now the three players in this sad drama are to be thrown back together at @entity100 , with @entity21 and @entity23 riding in the hope of a place in the @entity103 ’ enclosure and @entity2 waiting by the side of the track to interview whomever triumphs			1
it has the potential to be rather awkward , particularly given @entity2 ’s unguarded comments			1
‘ it remains difficult between @entity23 and i ’ , she said recently , adding : ‘ i do n’t have anything to do with her			1
she does her riding and i do my work			0
we do n’t speak and i have no difficulties with that			2
’ it is a far cry from the days when @entity21 and @entity2 were dubbed the ‘ @entity122 ’ of racing			1
@entity125 of racing ’s hard - partying social scene , they shared a £ 2million mansion , @entity129 , in @entity25 , @entity97 , with their three children – now eight , seven , and five			1
@entity2 , the @entity132 - educated daughter of legendary 80s gambler @entity133 , says : ‘ @entity21 had a plane and one day , on my birthday , i had to get to @entity136 – which is always log - jammed with traffic – to cover a race			1
as there ’s a landing area at the course , @entity21 told me i could take the plane			1
’ it was one of many larks they enjoyed together , but four years ago cracks began to appear , and the burgeoning friendship between @entity21 and @entity23 , 31 , developed into a full - blown affair			1
it is a matter of enduring regret for @entity21 , 32 , regarded on the circuit as a ‘ wild ’ @entity151 who is nevertheless utterly devoted to his children			1
@entity23 ( above ) and @entity21 split up soon after the affair was discovered he has previously said : ‘ i made a monumental error of judgment and now have to live with it			1
what i did is hard to explain			0
there ’s not a day goes by that i do n’t think of the catastrophic consequences of my stupidity			0
it ’s hard , day in , day out			0
’ he went on to say : ‘ i found the one person , but overnight it was all gone			0
some evenings i think hard about it and can never find the reason why it happened			0
a huge error of judgment cost me all the things i wanted from a young age			0
a day does n’t go by without me thinking about it			0
’ @entity2 , however , is adamant that the marriage is over for good			1
she says she would never consider another relationship with a jockey , adding : ‘ i was 23 when i met @entity177 and marrying a jockey – or someone in horse racing – seemed inevitable at that stage in my life			1
‘ but it is a very close - knit and gossipy world			2
everyone knows your business and that can be tough when you are going through a very difficult situation			0
i want to find someone outside this business			0
‘ maybe mr @entity192 is out there for me somewhere			0
it ’s fair to say i am paddling my own canoe at the moment , but i hope that one day i will find someone special			0
i am extra cautious about any relationship because of the children			0
i would n’t introduce them to anyone i was having a relationship with until i was very sure it was a long - term thing			2
’ most women would feel a sense of bitterness at being forced to watch their husband ’s mistress continue to compete alongside him			0
and it is telling that while @entity2 insists she has now ‘ moved on ’ , she most certainly does not wish to be friends with the woman who wrecked her marriage			1
but nor does she want to confront @entity23			2
‘ no , i have never discussed what happened with her , ’ she says softly			0
‘ what would it achieve ? i ’m not a confrontational person and i do n’t see the point in holding a grudge			0
’ so if that means congratulating @entity23 on a win next week , @entity2 says she will take it in her stride			1
‘ it would be unprofessional to let outside factors get in the way , i have moved on , ’ she says			0
‘ it ’s all too easy for people to tune into racing and assume that i am the token blonde , that i ’m some kind of bimbo			0
but i ’ve been brought up in this world , my parents were successful trainers and i know a lot about this business			0
‘ i work incredibly hard at being good at my job and looking after my children , those are my priorities			0
’ @entity2 insists she and her former husband are now on good terms , saying : ‘ of course when he is in a race i will be cheering him on			1
’ @entity242 to head : former lovers @entity23 , left , and @entity21 are set to compete at @entity100 @entity21 and @entity23 split up soon after the affair was discovered			1
and @entity23 has said that marriage and children are ‘ not high on my list of priorities right now ’			2
meanwhile there is the pressing issue of what to wear for @entity100			2
viewers often tune in to see what @entity2 is wearing and are critical if they see the same outfit twice			2
she says she ‘ loves fashion ’ , adding : ‘ unfortunately , i do n’t get a clothing allowance from @entity5 , so weeks like @entity100 can be incredibly expensive			2
i always have at least eight outfits with me and last year i was running into the @entity257 when i was stopped by an official who said my dress was too short			0
rather than argue , i raced to my car , did a quick change and managed to get back in time for my interviews			0
this year i ’ve made sure everything is on the knee			0
being banned from the @entity257 would be just too embarrassing ! ’ for all @entity2 ’s upbeat attitude , she is clearly feeling the strain of being a single mother			2
she juggles covering the flat racing season with looking after the three children			0
they live in an 11,000 sq ft house in @entity25 , while @entity21 has the ex-marital home , three miles away			1
‘ having two parents living apart is difficult ’ , she concedes			0
‘ but the children seem to be coping , it is all they have known since they were very little			0
the fact i am always busy has stopped me sitting down and dwelling on what happened			0
@entity100 will be shown live on @entity5 between june 17 and 21 .			1
