pictured is the @entity19 in @entity20 it was followed by the @entity22 at 59.4 , the @entity1 at 58.9 , and @entity23 and the @entity24 at 58.4			2
the @entity25 was the weakest of the @entity14 regions , at a still positive 57.6 , while @entity27 scored 59.3 and @entity28 55.9			0
the report undermines claims by @entity31 that the recovery is benefiting only a minority in @entity23 and the @entity34			1
@entity35 , managing director for small and medium sized businesses at @entity6 , said the ‘ robust ’ performance in june ‘ rounds off a strong second quarter for both manufacturing and services companies ’			0

‘ unemployment has just seen the biggest annual fall in 16 years and the unemployment rate is at a new five year low			0
