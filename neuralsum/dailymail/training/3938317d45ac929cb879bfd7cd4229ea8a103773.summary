@entity1 's most unloved dog who was nicknamed ' @entity3 ' after he was returned to a rescue centre three times by potential new owners has finally found a home			1
six - year - old @entity8 had lived at the shelter since he was found wandering the streets in april 2010			1
it took just two months for the brown @entity13 bull terrier cross to find his first home in june that year			1
six - year - old @entity8 was nicknamed @entity3 by the staff at @entity16 in @entity17 because potential owners kept returning him but , barely a week later , he was returned after his new owners decided that they did not have time to look after a dog			1
@entity8 left the home again in 2011 but was returned when his second set of owners separated and last year he was brought back after a third owner developed terminal cancer			1
this led to desperate staff nicknaming @entity8 ' @entity3 ' because he always came back to the @entity16 in @entity17			1
lovable : @entity8 is always smiling and wagging his tail			2
he is really good around children and as long as he has a comfy bed and a football he will be very happy finally last thursday a new family arrived at the centre and took @entity8 home			2
speaking yesterday @entity37 , the animal welfare coordinator at the shelter , said : ' @entity8 is such a lovely , loving dog			1
' it was really sad that we were n't able to find a forever home to settle in through no fault of his own			2
' we wanted to find him a family to live with because he is such a loving dog			2
' when people come to look at the dogs he sat in the window with his ears flapping away			0
' we are all wondering why he has n't gone because he is so adorable and such a loving boy - he does n't bark and jump up			0
' all the staff fell in love with @entity8 , he is always smiling and wagging his tail so i ca n't understand why he has n't found a home			1
' he 's just so affectionate , he craves fuss and cuddles and will be a lovely edition to the new family			0
' he was so excited when he went home with them , you could see he looked so happy and the family seemed lovely			0
' they had seen his picture on our website and said they just fell in love straight away			0
' fingers crossed now we wo n't see him back here again			0
' he loves to play with a ball and can often be found with a tennis ball in his mouth			0
' he is really good around children and as long as he has a comfy bed and a football he will be very happy			0

six - year - old @entity8 had lived at the @entity17 , @entity78 shelter since april 2010
