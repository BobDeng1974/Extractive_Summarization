by @entity0 published : 00:45 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 10:07 est , 8 august 2012 busted : federal agents have so far unearthed 4,100 images of child pornography and child erotica on just one of the more than 500 cds seized from @entity8 's home a disturbing secret diary of a pre-school professor who is under arrest for possessing child pornography reveals moments of physical contact with many of his pupils			1
@entity8 , 45 , has worked as a teacher at the exclusive @entity18 in @entity19 for the past 18 years			1
however , he was arrested on july 24 for possessing large amounts of child pornography and has since been held in jail			2
during a bail hearing yesterday , @entity19 prosecutors read out excerpts from the secret 800 - page diary of @entity8 , which he had kept since 1997			1
of one girl , @entity8 wrote , ' did hold [ name withheld by prosecutors ] by the waist briefly , and she did n't flinch			2
' another record read : ' had [ name withheld ] by the hips , and she was fine by that , ' @entity8 wrote of another little girl entrusted to his care			1
' gave her a kiss on the cheek , and no bad reaction			1
i love her so much			0
' in reply to one of his advances , @entity8 recalled a girl saying : ' i only let my family tickle me			2
' to this , he said in his diary : ' she 's obviously been coached			0
' prosecutors revealed the journal 's existence in a @entity19 federal court to argue to magistrate judge @entity51 that @entity8 should not be released before his upcoming trial			1
but despite all of the chilling testimony revealed by federal agents handling the case , judge @entity51 seemed skeptical the journal was , as @entity19 's @entity58 put it in their account of the proceedings , a smoking gun			1
@entity63 lost : @entity8 toiled at @entity18 , pictured , which is thought of as a haven for the privileged children of @entity19 's elite instead , @entity51 suggested the journal may simply represent a child care worker 's log of innocuous day - to - day activities with his students , chronicled to provide a defence against allegations of inappropriate conduct			1
a defence attorney , for his part , maintained the journal , and the behavior contained therein , represented , as the @entity80 station put it , ' only a record of benign , caring interactions between a preschool teacher and his students			1
' @entity85 did not try to gild his client 's affinity for kiddie porn , but rather argued that @entity8 had constructed a de facto ' wall ' between his sordid peccadilloes for porn , and how he interacted with the children entrusted to his care			2
' when someone has ' fessed up and come clean , ' @entity94 told the judge			0
' they 're well down the road to recovery			0
' despite this , prosecutors reportedly disclosed information about an alleged incident 10 years ago when a @entity105 family accused @entity8 of improperly touching their 3 - year - old daughter			2
a federal agent testified tuesday that the 2001 allegation concerned a young girl adopted from a @entity111 orphanage who was still learning @entity113			0
shades of @entity115 : like the former @entity118 football coach , @entity115 , pictured , prosecutors allege @entity120 ' groomed ' potential victims , testing boundaries and limits the agent testified , according to @entity58 , the girl 's parents said their daughter kept repeating the phrase ' @entity128 ' as she pointed to her genitals			2
the agent also swore under oath that the girls ' parents believe @entity8 once changed their daughter 's diaper in a remote , unused section of the school			0
however , @entity8 just faces charges of owning child pornography			0
he first reportedly told federal agents he owned about 200 images			0
but prosecutors revealed in court tuesday federal agents unearthed 4,100 images of child porno and child erotica on just one of the more than 500 cds seized from @entity8 's home			1
along with that stockpiled stash of cds , federal agents working for the @entity153 @entity152 confiscated six portable hard drives and two desktop computers containing as - yet undisclosed materials from @entity8 's abode			1
tuesday 's court proceedings were witnessed by many @entity18 parents , many of which , according to @entity58 , shielded their ears with hands and fingers so as to muffle disturbing accounts of what agents found in @entity8 's cache			1
still , @entity51 reserved judgement , reportedly saying tuesday , ' this is not the @entity173 where it 's a thumbs up , thumbs down decision by the community			0
' the judge later added , ' there 's no evidence of grooming			0
there is an obsession with his interactions with small children ... that is strange			0
i do n't want a horrific event occurring on my watch			0
' @entity51 then subsequently accorded himself 24 hours to decide whether to hold @entity8 without bail until his upcoming child pornography trial			1
@entity8 resigned from the school last thursday			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

@entity8 *meticulously* recorded the limits he could go with each child , writing of one little girl , ' gave her a kiss on the cheek , and no bad reaction . '
journal reveals calculated approach to ' grooming ' of more than 100 little ones entrusted to @entity8 's care
@entity208 presented in court tuesday , as *officials* argue @entity19 man should be held without bail until trial
judge says he will take 24 hours to render decision
defense : journal is merely a record of benign , caring by - play between a preschool teacher and his students
