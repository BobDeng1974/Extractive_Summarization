perhaps @entity1 ’s players will be docked wages for this brazen disregard of club policy ? for how dare they ignore the @entity6 mandate - we do not prioritise @entity8 – and do so in front of a live television audience ? these were the understudies , supposed to exit stage left and allow the leading men to concentrate on the cash cow that is the @entity15			1
a cup run , after all , is a distraction			0
@entity18 ( left ) had n't played a competitive match for @entity1 since august 2012 @entity20 ( left ) scores @entity1 's opening goal of the @entity23 clash but the black - and - white boys did not read the script			1
instead , they defied the odds , the odds which pitched a starting xi worth £ 20million against the strength of a @entity31 side valued at 10 times that meagre amount			1
and do not forget , this was a @entity1 team which included @entity18 , a player making his first appearance in 26 months and admirably making it through the 90 minutes			1
he was , in fact , man - of - the - match			0
‘ he was outstanding , ’ said @entity38			2
‘ he got a special round of applause when he came in the dressing - room afterwards and our players love him			0
@entity44 proud of youngsters @entity20 is congratulated by @entity46 boss @entity38 for his early goal against @entity31 the @entity1 fans perform the ' @entity49 ' to mock the @entity31 supporters after their side go 2 - 0 up ‘ but all of the players were magnificent and we thoroughly deserved that victory			1
’ @entity18 had a hand in the opening goal , robbing @entity57 to set free the brilliant @entity20 who did the rest with a cool finish			0
he also inflicted the injury which unsettled @entity31 , his inadvertent trod on @entity62 ending the @entity63 ’s evening after just nine minutes			2
but there was nothing accidental about @entity1 ’s valiant display			2
@entity67 – returning from a six - week hamstring layoff – was a menace during the opening 45 minutes in which he outshone the likes of @entity74 and @entity75			2
and this from an 18 - year - old making only his second senior start			0
@entity1 have knocked @entity31 out of the @entity23 after goals from @entity20 and @entity80 ( above ) @entity82 , meanwhile , has only been on @entity83 since july but , speaking before the game , he mentioned the club ’s 45 - year wait for a trophy – we take it he did n’t pick that up from a @entity38 team - talk , for six changes reinforced @entity1 ’s @entity93 priority			1
the manager , though , has to play politician and , had he named his strongest xi , it would not have been to the liking of his paymasters			0
but his understudies are now just two games from the biggest stage of all , how dare they …			0

@entity1 caused a big upset on *wednesday* night , beating @entity31 2 - 0
@entity38 had made six changes to the side that beat @entity107
they have n't won a trophy in 45 years , but are two games from @entity112
their starting @entity96 cost £ 20million ; @entity31 's ten times that
