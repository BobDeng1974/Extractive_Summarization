the slopes of a huge @entity2 volcano , once covered in ice , may have been home to one of the most recent habitable environments to be found on the red planet			1
geological landforms discovered on @entity9 , the @entity2 ’ third tallest volcano , suggest that lakes could have existed on the planet 210 million years ago			1
researchers believe the lakes may have been home to bacteria and other single - celled organisms which evolved at the same time as dinosaurs began appearing on @entity19			1
heat from a volcano erupting would have created lakes of liquid water on @entity2 in the relatively recent past			1
pictured in the inset are channels created by water flows emerging from the edge of glacial deposits roughly 210 million years old			0
the main image shows the @entity9 volcano with the colours indicating elevation nearly twice as tall as @entity34 , @entity9 would have produced intense heat from eruptions that melted massive amounts of ice to form englacial lakes			1
these are bodies of water that form within glaciers like liquid bubbles in a half - frozen ice cube			1
the ice - covered lakes of @entity9 would have held hundreds of cubic miles of meltwater , according to calculations by @entity50 , a graduate student at @entity51 in @entity52			1
and where there ’s water , there ’s the possibility of a habitable environment			0
‘ this is interesting because it ’s a way to get a lot of liquid water very recently on @entity2 , ’ ms @entity50 said			2
pictured is the giant @entity9 volcano on the @entity2 surface			1
scientists believe the heat from @entity9 ’ eruptions would have melted massive amounts of ice to form englacial lakes			1
these are bodies of water that form in glaciers like liquid bubbles in a half - frozen ice cube while 210 million years ago might not sound recent , the @entity9 site is much younger than the habitable environments turned up by @entity78 and other @entity2 rovers			1
those sites are all likely older than 2.5 billion years			0
the fact that the @entity9 site is relatively young makes it an interesting target for possible future exploration			0
‘ if signs of past life are ever found at those older sites , then @entity9 would be the next place i would want to go , ’ ms @entity50 said			2
scientists have speculated since the 1970s that the northwest flank of @entity9 may once have been covered by glacial ice			1
this is because the terrain around @entity9 looks strikingly similar to landforms left by receding glaciers in the @entity97 of @entity98			2
the ice - covered lakes of @entity9 would have held hundreds of cubic miles of meltwater , according to calculations by @entity50 , a graduate student at @entity51 in @entity52			1
pictured is an artist 's impression of what this may have looked like on a warmer , wetter @entity2 parallel ridges toward the bottom of the mountain appear to be drop moraines — piles of rubble deposited at the edges of a receding glacier			0
a group of small hills in the region also appears to be debris left behind by slowly flowing glacial ice			0
working with the @entity121 , ms @entity50 found evidence that hot volcanic lava may have flowed in the region the same time that the glacier was present			2
data from @entity128 ’s @entity127 revealed pillow lava formations similar to those that form on @entity19 when lava erupts at the bottom of an ocean			2
she also found the kinds of ridges and mounds that form on @entity19 when a lava flow is constrained by glacial ice			1
the pressure of the ice sheet constrains the lava flow , and glacial meltwater chills the erupting lava into fragments of volcanic glass , forming mounds and ridges with steep sides and flat tops			0
ms @entity50 calculated that two of the lava deposits would have created lakes containing around 25 cubic miles ( 40 cubic kilometres ) of water each			0
even in the frigid conditions of @entity2 , that much ice - covered water would have remained liquid for a long period of time			1
ms @entity50 ’s back - of - the - envelope calculation suggests the lakes could have persisted or hundreds or even a few thousand years			2
that may have been long enough for the lakes to be colonised by microbial life forms , if such creatures ever inhabited @entity2 , the researchers said			2
@entity169 bugs from @entity19 could soon hitch a ride into space , arrive on the red planet and trick scientists into thinking they are @entity174			2
this is according to @entity128 researcher , dr @entity176 , who has expressed serious concern that microbes may beat humans in the race to colonise @entity2			0
dr @entity176 highlights recent research that shows some bugs are more resilient than first thought and could use protective mechanisms to survive deep space flights			0
currently , spacecraft landing on @entity2 or other planets where life might exist must meet requirements for a maximum allowable level of microbial life			0
these acceptable levels were based on studies of how various life forms survive exposure to the challenges associated with space travel			0
‘ if you are able to reduce the numbers to acceptable levels , a proxy for cleanliness , the assumption is that the life forms will not survive under harsh space conditions , ’ dr @entity176 said			0
however , spores of @entity207 have shown high resistance to techniques used to clean spacecraft , such as ultraviolet radiation and peroxide treatment			0
when researchers exposed this hardy organism to a simulated @entity2 environment that kills standard spores in 30 seconds , it survived 30 minutes .			0

evidence comes from landforms found on the flanks of @entity9 volcano
heat from @entity9 may have melted huge amounts of ice to form lakes
scientists believe lakes may have been home to single - celled organisms
they would have evolved at same time as dinosaurs appeared on @entity19
earlier evidence of habitable areas on @entity2 was dated to 2.5bn years ago
