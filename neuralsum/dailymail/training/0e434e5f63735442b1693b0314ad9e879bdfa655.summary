by @entity0 published : 15:24 est , 23 july 2012 updated : 16:42 est , 23 july 2012 accused : @entity1 , 57 , pictured in 2009 , has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife , @entity4 @entity1 introduced himself to would - be jurors today as jury selection began in the former suburban @entity10 police officer 's long - delayed murder trial			1
@entity1 , 58 , is charged with killing his third wife , @entity4 , in 2004			1
her body was found in a dry bathtub in her home , her hair soaked with blood			0
the @entity17 police sergeant also is a suspect in the 2007 disappearance of his fourth wife , @entity19 , although he has not been charged			1
@entity1 , his trademark mustache shaved off , stood and spoke to some 40 potential jurors as proceedings began today			1
' good morning ladies and gentlemen , i 'm mr @entity1 , ' he said in a steady voice			2
during the trial , jurors are likely to hear statements the women allegedly made to friends and relatives about threats @entity1 made			1
such hearsay is usually barred , but an appellate court ruled jurors can hear the statements			1
the 200 - person jury pool has been waiting three years for a trial to get under way			2
it was put off because of appellate court battles over the hearsay statements			0
' i 've never heard of anything comparable to this — a jury pool waiting around for so long knowing what case they 're going to be in and the reliance on hearsay , ' said @entity51 , a @entity10 defense lawyer with no link to the case			2
publicity in the case is an issue as the judge and attorneys question jurors			1
the legal saga surrounding @entity1 and whether he used his status as a police officer to try to get away with murder has attracted national attention			2
@entity64 portrayed @entity1 in a 2011 tv movie , @entity1 : untouchable			2
the defense raised concerns that some prospective jurors may have violated orders to avoid all news about @entity1			1
some of the half dozen would - be jurors questioned by the judge on monday acknowledged they have been unable to completely avoid the television , radio and newspaper coverage of the case			2
one man said that when he hears @entity1 's name on the radio he switches it off or leaves the room			2
but the man said that just last week he saw @entity1 's photograph splashed across the front page of a suburban @entity10 newspaper			2
one woman who was asked what she thinks she 's heard about the case answered : ' something about a bathtub			0
' earlier days : former @entity90 police sergeant @entity1 talks to the media as he leaves his home in @entity90 , @entity93 in 2007 in memoriam : flowers and a small angel statue surround the grave marker of @entity4 , the third wife of @entity1 , at the @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity93 vetting would - be jurors typically takes a few days , but extra time is sometimes required in high - profile cases to weed out those who come in with well - formed opinions			1
opening statements at @entity1 's trial in @entity106 are slated for next tuesday			1
jurors are likely to hear from a parade of pathologists who will dispute each other 's conclusions about how @entity4 died , aged just 40			1
they will hear about her death being ruled an accident , her body being exhumed after 23 - year - old @entity19 's disappearance and the autopsy after which her cause of death was changed from accidental to homicide — and the continued dispute over those findings			1
there 's apparently no physical evidence , so the hearsay is the heart of prosecutors ' case			1
before jury selection began today , @entity131 judge @entity130 refused prosecutors ' request to give them blanket approval to admit eight key hearsay statements			0
@entity130 said he will make a final ruling on the admissibility of each statement only as they come up at trial			0
neither @entity130 nor the attorneys spoke in any detail about the substance of the eight statements			0
at a 2010 hearing to determine what hearsay a jury could hear , dozens of witnesses testified that @entity150 told them she feared @entity1 would kill her and make it look like an accident			1
one question looming over the trial is how much @entity1 's personality will influence the jury			1
before his arrest , @entity1 was often seen joking about a ' win a date with @entity1 ' contest , his missing wife 's menstrual cycle and other topics that were widely seen as inappropriate			1
grave charges : @entity1 is accused of murdering @entity4 , left			1
it was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the bathtub , right , but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a homicide @entity1 often joked with an army of news crews camped outside his house and even invited @entity173 into his kitchen			1
@entity175 has said the three years that @entity1 has been in jail and largely out of the public eye might help him because the memories of his behavior have faded			2
@entity1 , jailed since his 2009 arrest , pleaded not guilty			0
his attorneys say @entity150 's death was an accident and that @entity19 — 30 years younger than @entity1 — ran off with another man and is alive			1
authorities have said they believe she is dead , although her body has never been found			0
the frenetic coverage ' absolutely has the possibility of reigniting , ' said @entity190 , a prominent @entity191 defense attorney who has been at the center of comparable firestorms , including when he represented @entity194 ( no relation ) , a @entity191 man convicted of murdering his young wife and unborn child			0
prosecutors expect to tell a relatively simple story : @entity1 killed his ex-wife to keep her from making off with much of his money in a contentious divorce			2
sometime around february 29 , 2004 , according to the indictment , @entity1 went to @entity150 's house and in the bathroom caused her ' to inhale fluid ' , killing her			0
observers say @entity1 may benefit from the three years he 's been behind bars and out of the public eye , if only because he spent much of the past three years in solitary confinement , with his only human contact being from guards bringing him meals			1
' he really was becoming one of the more hated individuals in @entity217 , ' @entity218 , a prominent defence attorney in @entity219			0
' because he was in jail , he took himself off the front page , and that can only help him with a jury pool			0
' @entity1 's attorney agreed			0
' nobody 's going to deny that @entity1 's relatively goofy behaviour rubbed people the wrong way , ' said @entity175 , who explained @entity1 's actions as both the by - product of a sometimes grim job and his way of moving on after his wife left him			2
' the fact that he has n't been at that for a period of years certainly helps some of his past antics fade from memory			0
' missing : @entity1 , right , is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife , @entity19 , right but that simple story is complicated by what happened after @entity150 's body was discovered by a friend of @entity1 's			1
@entity1 had called the friend to the house to look for @entity150 , saying he was worried			0
detectives are expected to testify , as they did at a hearing in 2010 , that nobody collected a single fingerprint or hair fiber at the house			0
they will likely acknowledge that @entity150 's relatives , who could have told investigators about the couple 's on - going battles , were never interviewed			0
jurors may also hear , as a judge did at the 2010 hearing , that @entity1 was allowed to sit in on a police interview with @entity19 as a ' professional courtesy '			1
this happened while officers were trying to confirm @entity1 's whereabouts the weekend @entity150 died			0
the one - time policeman of the year , told a reporter at the @entity267 : ' i ’m sick of being called sinister			0
' instead he insisted he was a romantic and his disastrous track record with women was not his fault - it was because he picked ' women who changed after getting married '			1
taken in : police lt. @entity275 , left , and a fellow investigator escort @entity1 , centre , into @entity277 state police headquarters in 2009 times past : @entity1 , pictured on his motorcycle two months before his indictment in 2009 , left , and right , with missing fourth wife @entity19 authorities then reopened the investigation into the march 2004 death of his third wife @entity4 , who was initially thought to have drowned accidentally in her bathtub			1
but it was reclassified as a homicide after her body was exhumed and a medical examiner ruled she drowned following a struggle			0
@entity1 was arrested and charged with her death in may 2009 and is being held on $ 20million bail			2
during the 30 - minute interview in the jail 's visitor center , @entity1 spoke about his children claiming to be a good father			0
he said his sons with @entity4 , @entity299 and @entity300 , had never asked him if he had killed their mother because they knew he had not			2
he also said that he told his youngest children , @entity303 and @entity304 , that their mother @entity305 was on vacation			0
they are currently being looked after by one of his son 's from his first marriage - @entity1 has six children from three of his four marriages			0
when asked if he missed @entity305 he said he did sometimes , but said if she did reappear the first thing he would do is ' ask her to sign the divorce papers '			1
family : during the interview @entity1 claimed he was very close with his two children he had with his third wife , @entity150 : @entity299 and @entity300 he said his last girlfriend @entity318 has asked him to marry her three years ago , but he had not seen her since she had become intimidated by the press			1
last year it emerged that @entity1 had written a dozen jail - house love letters from jail , repeatedly propositioning a woman he has known since she was 14			0
@entity324 , now 40 , said the former @entity93 police sergeant has been plaguing her with bizarre and increasingly sexual requests , like asking for her measurements , photos of her in a bikini as well as describing what he wants to do to her in bed			0
he also asked her if she had any sexually transmitted diseases			0
in letters , obtained by the @entity334 , he wrote to her : ' i just think of your smile and holding you in the dark feeling your body against mine ... i want to spend a lot of time with my lips on yours			0
' i like sex with a lot of foreplay , i 'm more into pleasing my partner than pleasing others			0
' @entity1 spoke to @entity351 about the disappearance of his fourth wife , sticking to his story that she walked out on him , saying she could have all her clothes .			1

@entity1 , 57 , has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife , @entity4
chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife , @entity19
claimed he picked ' women who changed after getting married '
when asked what he would do if @entity305 reappeared he replied : ' ask her to sign the divorce papers '
jurors will hear evidence based on hearsay
publicity will be an issue in the case
