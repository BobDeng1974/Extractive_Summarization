@entity1 's most famous pools winner who pledged to ' spend , spend , spend ' after winning more than £ 150,000 has died			1
@entity2 , 79 , became rich overnight when she scooped £ 152,319 in 1961 with her husband @entity3			1
the win , on a football betting pool , in which gamblers predict the results of football games across a season , would be worth up to £ 5million in today 's money			1
the pair , from @entity13 , @entity14 , splurged the cash on flash cars , designer clothes , holidays and partying - frittering away half of their wealth within four years of winning			1
she managed to reclaim some of the money after a lengthy legal battle , but lost it all again from poor investments on the stock market			0
she later suffered a stroke in 2011 , which her son said led to the onset of dementia , and moved into a care home			1
her family confirmed she passed away yesterday following a long battle with the brain disease and requested for donations to be made to dementia @entity1 in her memory			1
in a statement released today , her son @entity54 said : ' we are saddened to announce the death of our much loved mum , @entity2			1

' @entity2 was a one - off in all ways - a loving and loved mother , a glamorous great grandmother and a friend to many			1
mrs @entity2 lived a fascinating lifestyle , staying true to her word by spending all of the money which she famously won when she was just 25 - years - old			1
in 2007 , she recalled the evening she realised she had won the huge sum of money			2
she said : ' we found out on saturday evening that we 'd won the pools , but we could n't find the coupon			1
we were n't sure if we 'd sent it off or not , but then the winning ticket turned up in @entity3 's trousers			2
' it 's unbelievable that i remember the exact amount we won so clearly - it was £ 152,300 , 18 shillings and eight pence			2
back then , even the eight pence meant something			0
' i walked half a mile to the @entity85 to send the telegram to the pools company			2

right : newspaper coverage of her win the couple found themselves being mobbed by reporters at @entity105			2
then the cheque was presented to them by @entity23			0
asked what she planned to do with it , @entity2 gleefully replied : ' spend , spend , spend ! ' back then , there was no network to support or advise big winners - possibly because hardly anyone had ever won that much			1
having promised to spend , not save , the naive young couple retreated to @entity14 and recklessly proceeded to do just that			2
they bought a large bungalow in a smart suburb a few miles down the road from where they grew up and she ordered dresses from @entity124 , bought a pink @entity125 and then swapped it for a different luxury car every six months			0
@entity3 , a former miner , bought a racehorse and the children were sent to boarding school			2
she said : ' we travelled all over the @entity132 and @entity133			0
' however , the money soon started to dwindle and mr @entity33 died when his car skidded off the @entity136 just four years after the big win			1
following his death , mrs @entity2 married four more times , but was widowed again and went on to battle with alcohol and depression			1
a short - lived attempt to start a new life in @entity144 was soon curtailed after she was deported for fighting with a police officer			0
in desperation she took to performing ' @entity147 ' in a @entity149 strip club , but was fired when she refused to take off her underwear			0
in 1984 , @entity151 asked her to pose for the cover of their hit single @entity154 now			0
her story was turned into a televised @entity157 play and later a musical - both called @entity158 , spend , spend in honour of her catchphrase			2

she also criticised people who condemned her for splashing her cash and not investing it wisely			0
she said : ' people say i should be ashamed of what i spent my money on , and that i could have done so much more			0
