by @entity1 reporter published : 09:58 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 19:27 est , 18 june 2013 legal action : @entity3 is suing her former lawyer over claims that mistakes cost her a much larger divorce payout a wealthy mother who claims her multi-million - pound divorce settlement was far smaller than it should have been because her solicitor was negligent is suing for up to £ 15million			1
@entity3 , 51 , told the @entity11 that the solicitor failed to stop her ex-husband taking up to £ 2million a year from the family firm and lavishing it on children from another marriage and a mistress			1
company director @entity19 , an 82 - year - old father of seven , should have been restricted to an income of £ 250,000 , with small annual increases , under an agreement drawn up in 2003 with the advice of her solicitor , she said			1
but lawyers representing her at the @entity11 said that , because of the way it was worded , mr @entity19 was able to take huge annual sums from the company , leaving her massively out of pocket when they divorced			0
her barrister , @entity33 , claimed : ' @entity19 was having an extra-marital affair			0
he had been hiding money from @entity3 and was , without her consent , diverting away significant part of the family 's joint wealth to his older children and possibly to his mistress			2
' the couple , who had three children , married in 1993 when mrs @entity3 was 32 and mr @entity19 was 62			1
they enjoyed a jetset lifestyle , with a £ 4.5million @entity47 home in @entity48 and another luxurious home in @entity50			0
mr @entity19 once bought his wife a £ 230,000 horse as a gift			0
but mrs @entity3 , of @entity54 , @entity55 , claimed she did not know how great her husband 's earnings really were until 2002 , when a friend on the school run told her he was on the @entity60			2
' i was so shocked , i was flabbergasted , ' she told mrs @entity62 , adding that by then she had formed a ' deep distrust ' of her husband , whom she suspected of having an affair			0
she said she went to @entity66 , of the law firm @entity67 , telling him she wanted an agreement with ' full protection ' to stop her husband taking large sums out of the family 's thriving shower business , @entity73 , for his own use			2
' i told him that there were severe problems in the marriage and i had very good reason not to trust @entity80 and that i could n't go on like this , ' she told the court			0
mrs @entity3 said she believed the agreement drawn up by @entity67 limited her husband 's salary to £ 250,000 , with a 5 - per - cent annual increase			1
dividends and bonuses from the company would go into a joint account to pay for the family 's living expenses			0
but the agreement did not prevent mr @entity19 from being paid huge sums because it linked his pay rises to the company 's burgeoning profits			2
she told the court : ' what i was so in the dark about was how he was able to take so much more than i thought he was supposed to be taking			0
' mr @entity103 said mr @entity66 knew what mrs @entity3 had wanted to achieve in the 2003 agreement and failed to secure it , resulting in ' uncontrolled withdrawals of funds ' from @entity73 by her husband			1
claim : @entity3 said she went to @entity66 , of law firm @entity67 ( pictured ) , and told him she wanted an agreement with ' full protection ' to stop her husband taking large sums out of the family 's thriving shower business compensation claim : the divorcee is suing in the @entity11 for £ 15million and alleges negligence ' had she been properly advised , she would never have assented to the shareholders ' agreement in the form in which it was executed , ' he added			1
mrs @entity3 received 45 per cent of the matrimonial assets in a divorce judgment last year , but says her slice should have been worth far more			1
denying all the claims , @entity67 ' barrister , @entity125 , insisted the £ 250,000 - a - year figure had never been mentioned and mrs @entity3 had not been in a position to make demands , but only to negotiate			1
the agreement limited her husband 's withdrawals from the firm to those which would allow @entity73 to ' grow and prosper in the future with sufficient retained funds ' , he said			0
he added that there was no evidence that the amounts her husband took compromised that aim and told the court mr @entity19 's salary had only increased so quickly because it was linked to soaring profits			0

@entity3 , 51 , said the lawyer should have made sure her husband only paid himself £ 250,000 - a - year from the family business
father - of - seven @entity19 has been paying himself up to £ 2m - a - year
mrs @entity3 said her lawyer was negligent in his wording of the agreement
the mother - of - three received a multi-million pound divorce settlement
