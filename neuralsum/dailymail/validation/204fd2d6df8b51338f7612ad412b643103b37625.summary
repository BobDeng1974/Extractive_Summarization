the best of @entity1 come face - to - face on saturday afternoon when @entity4 's @entity3 take on @entity6 's @entity5 at @entity7			1
and @entity4 , who has scored the most goals of any @entity10 player in the @entity11 this season , is keen to put his past behind him to be viewed as a footballer and not an ex-builder			1
the 25 - year - old came up through the ranks in lower league football , before getting his break in the big time			2
to fund himself while playing for clubs like @entity23 and @entity24 , @entity4 was a builder by trade , but now the time has come for a change in mentality			1
@entity4 ( right ) thinks he has scored enough goals to be considered a footballer rather than a builder @entity4 has come up through the ranks , starting in @entity34 and working his way to the top ' i have scored 100 - odd career goals now , ' @entity4 told @entity39 , ' and think i have done enough to be considered a player rather than a builder who plays football			1
i know where i have come from but i feel like i have done enough to be known as a footballer now			2
' the only blisters i have on my hands these days are from the gym			0
laying bricks was about five or six years ago now			0
' his journey to this point is the antithesis of @entity6 's , who has spent 11 years in the relative comfort of @entity5 's academy			2
the now - @entity3 striker got his first @entity11 break at @entity58 , for whom he scored over 30 goals @entity4 takes on team - mate @entity60 during a training session at @entity3 for @entity4 though , that route did n't work out			1
he was released by @entity63 as a teenager for being too small , and had to rely on opportunities elsewhere to get where he is today			0
' coming through the academies did n't work for me , ' the @entity3 striker continues			1
' i was released at 14			0
i would n't change it at all			0
@entity6 [ @entity69 ] would probably tell you the same about his upbringing			2
we just got taught differently			0
' my way you pick up things as you go through the game			0
for players in academies ... everything is in place for them at the clubs			0
' regardless of their differences , @entity4 and @entity6 will face each other for the first time on saturday afternoon			1
in fact , they 've never even met before			0
29 league goals between them this season has warranted calls for international call - ups , but all eyes will be on west @entity93 to see which player comes out on top in this encounter			2
@entity4 's career in football has been the opposite of @entity6 , who has been at @entity5 for 11 years the 25 - year - old will come face - to - face with @entity6 for the first time in his career on saturday afternoon			1

@entity4 was a builder while he played *semi-professional* football
now , as a @entity11 footballer , he wants to put his past behind him
@entity4 says he thinks he has done enough to be known as a footballer
the @entity3 striker comes face - to - face with @entity6 on saturday ; the pair are the two *highest* - scoring *englishmen* in this season 's @entity11
