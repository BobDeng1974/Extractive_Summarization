by @entity0 published : 16:55 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 17:16 est , 19 july 2013 the head of the @entity3 handed a £ 600,000 contract to a friend , it emerged last night			1
@entity6 has appointed @entity7 to lead a two - month review into making the corporation a ‘ simpler place to work ’			1
he worked with @entity11 , who is married to cabinet secretary sir @entity12 , at the @entity13 before he joined the @entity3 as director - general			1
in the money : @entity7 , pictured with husband sir @entity16 , has landed a plum job with the @entity3 her study with global management consultants @entity18 is not expected to cut the @entity3 ’s headcount or save money			1
@entity23 , who chairs the commons public accounts committee , said the links between the pair raised very serious questions as to how @entity18 beat its rivals to the contract			0
threatening to call @entity6 before the committee ’s next @entity3 hearing in september , the senior @entity32 mp said : ‘ if these questions are not adequately answered we will have to investigate them ourselves			1
‘ it ’s a lot of money			0
if you are going to pay consultants you have to go through the appropriate mechanisms and not use your friends			0
‘ with all eyes on the @entity3 at the moment i ca n’t understand why they do n’t appreciate that everything has to be visibly above board			1
’ @entity48 , a @entity49 mp on the @entity50 , has written to @entity6 asking him to publish all the documents relating to the @entity18 contract			2
‘ @entity6 was brought in as director - general with a clear mandate to put the days of murky relationships and mutual back scratching at the @entity3 behind them , ’ he said			1
‘ it is vital if his credibility is to be upheld that the @entity3 now urgently publish the tender documents relating to the awarding of this contract , so the licence fee payer can see beyond doubt that this contract was awarded on merit and not on the basis of personal favours			2
’ question time : @entity3 director general lord @entity6 may be called in front of mps to explain his decision to employ @entity11 he added : ‘ it seems extraordinary when you have so many highly paid executives that you need to bring in highly paid consultants to do a job they should be able to do themselves			1
‘ it is a very poor use of licence fee payers ’ money			0
the only way it will be good value for money is if the consultants recommend firing one of the @entity3 ’s senior managers			2
one of their salaries could pay for the whole exercise			0
’ a partner in @entity88 - based @entity18 , @entity11 is also a director of the @entity13 in @entity89 , where @entity6 was chief executive from 2001 until his switch to the @entity3 in april			1
the @entity3 insists @entity18 was hired ‘ after a competitive process ’			2
announcing the plan , @entity6 said : ‘ i want , as far as i can , to turn more of the organisation toward the programmes and our services , and less on the other things a big organisation like this does			2
‘ we all know that working in matrices is a very complex way of operating			0
we can make it simpler for people to take responsibility for what they do			0
‘ i hope that by this time next year , i will be standing before staff and licence fee payers with a simpler organisation , where responsibilities are much clearer			0
’ @entity18 was on a shortlist of four management consultancy firms before @entity6 made the final decision to award it the contract			2
earlier this year , he was criticised for appointing another former colleague to a top post at the @entity3 on a £ 395,000 salary			1
@entity120 , who was @entity121 ’s chief operating officer , was handed the role of managing director of finance and operations without the job being advertised			0
miss @entity120 spent three years with the @entity13 as director of finance and business affairs before joining @entity121 in 2005			0
@entity6 knows her from their time together at the @entity13 and also from his time as deputy chairman at @entity121			1
when he appointed her , he sent an email to staff saying she was a ‘ direct appointment rather than an advertised one ’ because he believed her talent and experience ‘ make her the best person for this role ’			0
her appointment came shortly after @entity6 announced he had hired former @entity32 culture secretary @entity141 as strategy and digital chief on £ 295,000 a year			2
like miss @entity120 he was appointed without the role being advertised			0
@entity144 , chief executive of the @entity145 ’ @entity146 , said : ‘ there ’s no doubt that the @entity3 needs to simplify its labyrinthine structures , but licence fee payers will be dismayed that yet again @entity18 is raking in a massive sum in consultancy fees			0
‘ given the vast sums that the @entity3 top brass are paid , you could be forgiven for thinking that they ought to be best placed to take a lead in sorting out their own organisation			0
’ at a public accounts committee hearing into the @entity3 severance payments scandal this month , @entity160 said the corporation ’s financial management was akin to ‘ corporate fraud and cronyism ’			0
in 2011 , the @entity3 was criticised for spending more than £ 8million on management consultants in just one year			0
last year , former director - general @entity168 hired accountancy firm @entity169 to help slash the number of managers at the corporation			1
a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ @entity18 were appointed because they were the best organisation to do the job			1
‘ a number of companies took part in a competitive tender process and were assessed and shortlisted before the director - general was involved			1
‘ the final decision was then unanimously taken by a committee comprising representatives from the @entity3 ’s strategy and finance divisions and the director - general			1

@entity11 and director - general of the @entity188 have worked together before
