the @entity0 may be the most prestigious individual prize a footballer can win , but a deeper look at the voting leaves a feeling of bemusement and frustration			1
@entity8 may have quite rightly been voted the world 's best player on monday night - his second consecutive win and third overall - and gushed about @entity13 , hailing his great rival for helping him become a better player			1
but the @entity17 superstar could not bring himself to include @entity13 in his top three players in the world , instead choosing to opt for team - mates @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
@entity8 ( left ) and @entity13 did not deem each other in the world 's best three players @entity8 and @entity13 ( right ) spoke positively about each other after the former was crowned the winner @entity8 beat @entity13 to the award as he was crowned the 2014 @entity0 winner after a stellar 12 months @entity33 president @entity32 congratulated @entity8 on winning the award at the ceremony @entity8 celebrated with his son @entity36 on stage after winning the @entity38 2014 @entity33 have published the full list of votes from each national captain , manager and media representative equally @entity13 , despite saying @entity8 deserved to win , voted for @entity46 team - mates @entity44 and @entity47 and @entity49 buddy @entity48			1
are the world 's two best players really that petty that they ca n't recognise the other 's achievements on paper ? but let 's be clear , @entity8 and @entity13 are not the only ones who simply ' vote for the boys '			1
@entity61 , captain of @entity62 , deemed international team - mates @entity64 and @entity65 as the world 's two best players with @entity69 third			1
no @entity8 , no @entity13 , no @entity70			1
really , @entity61 ? @entity8 voted for @entity17 team - mate @entity21 ( centre ) as the best player in the world @entity13 had @entity74 team - mate @entity44 ( centre ) in his top three players in the world @entity78 ( second , right ) included @entity79 and @entity81 team - mate @entity80 in his three @entity82 ( no 9 ) selected @entity83 pal @entity69 ( no 11 ) as the world 's best player @entity86 , the @entity87 captain , opted for former @entity90 team - mates @entity88 and @entity64 ahead of @entity69			1
again , no sign of the eventual top three			2
@entity79 captain @entity78 went a step further , picking international and @entity81 team - mates @entity70 , @entity80 and @entity95			1
the trio of course won a @entity99 title and a @entity100 , but did all three really outshine @entity8 and @entity13 ? unfortunately , the list goes on			1
@entity102 , captain of @entity103 , put above everyone else @entity105 - of , yes , you guessed it , @entity103			2
@entity109 captain @entity108 opted for @entity22 , @entity82 went for @entity69 and @entity110 deemed @entity111 team - mate @entity23 the world 's second - best player			1
@entity13 ( @entity46 ) – 1			1
@entity47 @entity8 ( @entity114 ) – 1			1
@entity23 @entity115 ( @entity116 ) – 1			2
@entity95 @entity117 ( @entity118 ) – 1			0
@entity47 @entity119 ( @entity79 ) – 1			0
@entity95 @entity82 ( @entity83 ) – 1			0
@entity70 @entity86 ( @entity87 ) – 1			1
@entity69 @entity108 ( @entity109 ) – 1			0
@entity65 @entity61 ( @entity62 ) – @entity122 2			0
@entity69 @entity102 ( @entity103 ) – 1			0
@entity44 @entity123 ( @entity124 ) – 1			0
@entity22 @entity110 ( @entity126 ) – 1			0
@entity70 * underlined players are club or international team - mates @entity130 ( @entity46 ) – 1			1
@entity47 @entity131 ( @entity62 ) – 1			0
@entity64 @entity132 ( @entity118 ) – 1			0
@entity120 @entity133 ( @entity103 ) – 1			0
@entity8 @entity135 ( @entity126 ) – 1			1
@entity23 @entity136 ( @entity79 ) – 1			0
@entity119 @entity137 ( @entity83 ) – 1			0
@entity8 @entity138 ( @entity139 ) – 1			1
@entity69 @entity140 ( @entity109 ) – 1			0
@entity119 * underlined players are national players ultimately what monday night proved is that football is full of politicking of the highest order , arguably as bad as that seen in @entity147			1
@entity149 , for example , decided to announce on monday that he regretted voting for @entity8 ahead of his @entity81 team - mate @entity70			1
' voting for @entity8 instead of @entity70 was a mistake , ' he told @entity153 newspaper @entity152			1
' i would clearly vote for @entity70 now if i had the chance			1
but i already cast my vote back in august or something			0
i would vote different now			0
' i am sorry for @entity158			0
i am really surprised that he did not even come in second and the big gap to @entity8 also baffles me			1
@entity70 is an amazing goalkeeper and person			2
' we can only presume that @entity149 had seen that his team - mate @entity78 had voted for @entity70 and lacked the conviction to stand by his view that @entity8 is in fact the better player			1
he offers no reason as to why he had this sudden change of heart , and may be it is as simple as wanting to save face in the dressing room			0
let 's not forget that men like @entity149 are leaders of their national teams , yet they act like teenagers voting for the prom king or queen			2
@entity102 ( right ) picked his @entity180 team - mate @entity105 ( centre ) as the world 's best player @entity105 was also picked as the top player by @entity103 coach @entity133 @entity105 won the @entity185 for the best goal of 2014 at monday evening 's ceremony @entity61 ( right ) picked @entity64 ( centre ) as the world 's best player sadly , this trend extends to the managers of national teams too			1
@entity130 went for an @entity193 1 - 2 - 3 of @entity13 , @entity194 and @entity47			1
yes , they reached a @entity100 final but do @entity194 and @entity47 really deserve to be there ? @entity103 's @entity133 picked as his no 1 player @entity105 , @entity62 coach @entity131 chucked in @entity199 at @entity200 , @entity135 gave his final spot to @entity126 striker @entity23 and @entity83 's @entity137 gave the top honour to @entity69			2
frankly , it is enough to make the stomach churn			0
surely , the managers and captains of national teams should be strong enough to pick the best three players in the world regardless of nationality and friendship ? and those that did , deserve special praise			2
@entity117 put aside rivalries to pick @entity8 behind his @entity49 team - mate @entity13			1
by contrast @entity17 's @entity115 found no place for @entity13 but had team - mate @entity219 and @entity95			1
this is no new trend and has been the norm for several years now and all it serves to do is take some of the gloss off what should be a night of celebration for football			0
away from the political and tactical voting , there were some eyebrow - raising decisions by certain managers and captains			2
here we look at the more questionable voting			2
@entity236 ( @entity124 coach ) – 1			0
@entity70 prince @entity237 ( @entity239 captain ) – 1			2
@entity13 2 @entity240 3 @entity241 @entity242 ( @entity244 captain ) – 1			2
@entity69 @entity246 ( @entity248 captain ) – 1			0
@entity8 @entity249 ( @entity251 captain ) – 1			2
@entity13 @entity252 ( @entity254 captain ) – 1			2
@entity117 @entity255 ( @entity256 coach ) – 1			0
@entity95 @entity257 ( @entity258 coach ) – 1			0
@entity240 @entity259 ( @entity260 coach ) – 1			0
@entity105 @entity261 ( @entity263 coach ) – @entity122 2			0
@entity48 @entity264 ( @entity251 coach ) – 1			0
@entity69 @entity265 ( @entity267 coach ) – 1			0

@entity8 was named 2014 @entity0 winner on monday evening
@entity13 came second and @entity70 third in the voting
@entity8 and @entity13 did not include each other in their top three votes
many players simply voted for their team - mates and *compatriots*
read : @entity8 and @entity13 remain best of *enemies*
