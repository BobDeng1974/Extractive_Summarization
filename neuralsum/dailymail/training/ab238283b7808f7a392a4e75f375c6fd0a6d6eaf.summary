@entity1 ’s attempts to put driverless cars on the road may have suffered a setback due to new motoring laws in @entity6			1
under the rules all drivers must be able to take ‘ immediate physical control ’ of a vehicle for it to be able to travel on roads in the @entity13 state			1
the law comes into effect on september 16 meaning that @entity1 will either have to get it changed or convince legislators it is complying with its futuristic vehicles			1
but the tech giant has created a car with no steering wheel or pedals which will be completely autonomous and rely on gps technology , cameras and in - built maps of cities to steer it that will be tricky as the tech giant has created a car with no steering wheel or pedals which will be completely autonomous and rely on gps technology , cameras and in - built maps of cities to steer it around			1
it wants to debut the two - seater vehicle in @entity6 where driverless cars are legal - but now lawmakers appear to have done a partial u-turn			2
@entity1 has not revealed how it will comply with the regulations as its prototype driverless car only has buttons for start , pull over and emergency stop			1
there is also a computer screen showing your route on the vehicle , which @entity1 hopes to have on the streets by 2017			1
testing on private roads has is due to start next month and will include temporary manual controls			0
a @entity1 spokesman said that the new @entity6 driving rules covered testing of its cars only			1
he said : ' during our testing we are equipping the vehicles with manual controls such as a steering wheel , brake pedal , and accelerator pedal			1
' with these additions , our safety drivers can test the self - driving features , while having the ability to take control of the vehicle if necessary			1
' however that is not the only hurdle that the cars have to overcome			0
another issue is liability for insurance companies in the event of an accident - experts have asked who will be responsible if there is no driver and @entity1 is effectively in charge of the vehicle			1
to get round this @entity6 has insisted that anyone testing a driverless car must have a $ 5 million insurance policy to cover any eventualities			0
in the @entity13 driverless cars are only allowed on roads in certain states if someone sits in the driver 's seat			1
the @entity103 is expected to start granting licences to certain driverless cars and their human co-pilots as soon as september			0
changes to the @entity109 @entity108 , which dates back to 1968 , are also afoot			0
it used to state : ' every driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals			2
' an amendment agreed in may would allow a car to drive itself , as long as the system ' can be overridden or switched off by the driver '			0
a driver must be present and able to take the wheel at any time			0
the convention covers @entity125 countries , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 , although not the @entity13 , @entity130 or @entity131			2
@entity1 has developed a digital simulation that its cars can drive around in ( 3d mapping software of the cars shown ) and test their abilities before they head out into the real world			2
@entity1 has not revealed how it will comply with regulations as its prototype driverless car only has buttons for start , pull over and emergency stop @entity143 , the chief executive of @entity144 , which makes laser technology used by @entity1 's autonomous cars , told the @entity147 that these questions left him concerned			1
he said : ‘ who pays when there 's a crash ? who will insure us against this ? ’ @entity1 ’s car is powered by electricity and could go about 100 miles before charging			1
its shape suggests a rounded - out @entity159 - something that might move people around a corporate campus or congested downtown - with headlights and sensors arrayed to resemble a friendly face			0
the prototype two - seater cars have buttons to autonomously begin and end the drive			0
the car makes turns and react to other vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do , and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read in real time what other objects are actually doing			0
the route might be set by typing a destination into a map or using spoken commands according to @entity187 , the leader of @entity1 's self - driving car team			2
the car will be powered by electricity and could go about 100 miles ( 160 km ) before charging			0
its shape suggests a rounded - out @entity159 - something that might move people around a corporate campus or congested downtown - with headlights and sensors arrayed to resemble a friendly face			0
the front of the vehicle has a soft foam - like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen , in a bid to be safer for pedestrians			0
in these prototypes speed is restricted to 25mph ( 40 km / h ) and the ability to self - drive will depend on specifically designed @entity1 road maps tested on the company ’s current fleet of vehicles			2
ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use @entity1 's extended maps service.driving works by using gps technology to locate the vehicle ’s exact position on an electronic map			1
a combination of radar , lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360 - degree ‘ view ’ , with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘ see ’ and identify people , cars , road signs and markings and traffic lights			2
the front of the vehicle has a soft foam - like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen , in a bid to be safer for pedestrians			0
@entity1 has suffered other setbacks with its driverless cars after critics pointed out they will be able to exceed the speed limit			2
cyber security experts also warned that they could be vulnerable to hacking because they will use wireless technology .			0
