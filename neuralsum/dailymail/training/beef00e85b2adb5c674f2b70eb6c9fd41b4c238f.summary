by @entity1 reporter published : 15:21 est , 8 september 2012 updated : 21:59 est , 8 september 2012 every day , a student attending @entity3 was forced to walk 15 miles each way to class because he did n’t own a car			1
but last month , a hit - and - run driver left him with a slew of serious injuries , making the walk impossible for 20 - year - old @entity11			1
now , thanks to the generosity of @entity14 , a woman who saw the student ’s story on the local news , @entity11 can drive to class			1
‘ i want to see you a surgeon one day , ’ she said			2
@entity11 is studying to be a surgical technician			2
he said that getting the 1990 @entity27 has only inspired him to work harder toward his dream			0
‘ i ’m thankful to be alive , ’ he told @entity42 , ‘ and that makes me want to be a surgical tech even more			0
’ last month , @entity11 was walking the 15 miles in @entity45 , @entity24			1
he said that a car came out of nowhere , throwing him up in the air			0
caveat : @entity14 said that he gets to keep the car on the condition he continues to do well in school roadside damage : he was struck by a hit - and - run driver last month on his walk back from school , puncturing a lung and broke a few ribs @entity56 : the thankful student gives @entity14 a hug for her generosity ‘ all of a sudden , out of nowhere , i felt a sharp pain and i blacked out , ’ he told @entity42 at the time			1

he said his 30 - pound backpack , stuffed to the brim , might have saved his life			2
police in @entity77 are still trying to track down the hit - and - run driver			1
the car , which rumbles ominously before starting , no doubt needs some work , but for @entity82 , the gift is beyond measure			0
and perhaps the best news of all ? rather than walking four - and - a - half hours each way , the trek to class only takes @entity11 15 minutes			1
