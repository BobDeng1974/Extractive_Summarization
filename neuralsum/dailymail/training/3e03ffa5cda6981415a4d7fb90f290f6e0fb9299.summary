fight scene : @entity131 ( left ) played lieutenant @entity132 in the 1964 film , @entity9 comparison : the film showed how the @entity4 soldiers were equipped with guns while the tribesmen only had spears and shields as the warriors who fought at @entity16 on january 22 , 1879 were mostly young men , it is highly likely to have been used there			1
' @entity144 placed men in regiments when they turned 18 , similar to doing national service , and he would give them a herd of cattle with similar colourings and markings			0
' the men would then kill the cows and use the hide to make shields with the fur still attached , which became a uniform due to the patterns			0
' darker coloured cows were given to less experienced warriors and lighter colours cows were used for the older and more experienced men			0

' once the @entity4 had conquered the @entity9 kingdom six months later it is likely that they gathered up items like these to take back home as a souvenir of the war			1
' they normally have a shelf life of around five years but it was probably well looked after and this would explain why it has remained in such good condition			0
' one of the spears in the sale was taken from the battlefield after the @entity201 war , we know that because a @entity4 troop appears to have carved ' @entity201 ' and the year on it			0
