@entity3 , the capital of the @entity4 , should be renamed @entity5 as a tribute to @entity7 , senior figures in the @entity1 and @entity2 are suggesting			1
the idea is being backed by mps and is also attracting considerable support on the islands , which @entity7 was responsible for liberating in 1982			1
the proposal is likely to trigger fury in @entity14 , which has been ratcheting up the rhetoric over the sovereignty of the @entity4 around the 30th anniversary of the conflict			1

@entity34 mp @entity33 , a parliamentary aide at the @entity1 , said : ‘ i would warmly encourage the @entity35 to consider this as a fitting way to remember her legacy			1
‘ she has been an inspirational 20th century political hero			1
one way to mark this extraordinary life and contribution would be for the @entity3 to be renamed from one prime minister who never set foot there to another who liberated it			1
’ mr @entity33 , who headed a successful campaign to have the tower which houses @entity49 renamed the @entity49 in honour of the @entity51 last year , added : ‘ @entity5 has a fine ring to it			1

sir @entity57 is pictured pointing to @entity58 , west of @entity60 @entity62 mp @entity61 , who is parliamentary private secretary to defence secretary @entity63 , said : ‘ i think it is a fantastic idea , as long as the people of the @entity4 agree			1
’ @entity66 , secretary of the all - party parliamentary group on the @entity4 , said the islanders would want to mark @entity7 ’s passing			1
‘ it is up to them exactly how they do it , ’ he said			2
‘ it could be a renaming or it could be a statue in @entity28			2
whatever they do i am sure they will commemorate her in an appropriate way			2
’ # @entity79 , a @entity80 member who met @entity7 four times , said : ‘ anything that remembers @entity83 and what she did for us is a good idea , and i imagine many other @entity35 would support it too			1
' she ’s our hero , a great person , and she will forever be part of the history of our islands			1

if we ’ve named an island after one soldier , there ’s every chance we can rename our capital after the person we owe everything to			2
’ former @entity4 policeman @entity114 , now a battlefield tour guide , said : ‘ i would be open to the idea of changing @entity28 ’s name in honour of @entity7			1
she was a great woman			2
it is highly likely that if she was n’t in power when @entity14 invaded the @entity4 i would n’t be here today			1
’ former defence minister sir @entity123 said : ‘ it is clearly a matter for the islanders but it would be a very nice tribute , and wholly appropriate			2
‘ it would also annoy [ @entity14 ’s ] president @entity130 , which on its own is a good reason for doing it			1
’ there have been calls for a statue to be erected to @entity7 in @entity135 , where sir @entity136 is commemorated			2
mr @entity66 said : ‘ there is an empty space in one corner of @entity135 and it would be entirely appropriate for a statue to be erected to @entity7			2
’ another suggestion was for @entity7 to occupy the vacant plinth in @entity144			2
@entity145 , lieutenant commander on the @entity146 during the @entity4 conflict , said : ‘ let ’s have a full - scale statue next to @entity150 to recognise that she was at the heart of the nation			1
’ @entity154 said : ‘ i think it would be appropriate for her to be honoured in the centre of @entity158			2
she could be in @entity144 , where @entity150 could keep an eye on her			0
’ @entity7 is one of only four former prime ministers to be recognised with a statue in the members ’ lobby of the @entity166			0
the statue , which joined @entity136 , @entity168 and @entity169 , was approved only after a change in the rules which previously barred depictions of living figures in the small lobby			0

but he said his upbringing in a working - class @entity34 family meant his grandmother never watched the programme			0
@entity188 said : ‘ my grandmother got very cross			0
i came from a working - class @entity34 background and my grandmother refused to watch @entity185 and only watched @entity208			0
but i understood strong independent women because i had been brought up by them , and i tried to do her as real as possible			0
‘ if it was not for @entity7 , @entity185 would not have existed			0
’ @entity188 added : ‘ the conviction of the woman – i had genuinely forgotten , because i have not done her for a long time , how she had the attitude coming straight through			0
‘ she was not known for having a sense of humour			0
even her friends admitted that side to her character			0
i do n’t think she would have got it			0
‘ she never understood anyone who did n’t agree with her , and that included comedians			0
