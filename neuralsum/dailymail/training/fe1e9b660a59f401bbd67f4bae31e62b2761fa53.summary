by @entity0 published : 05:30 est , 1 november 2013 updated : 05:36 est , 1 november 2013 a @entity2 man suffered from extreme body odour for four years because his armpit hair had become infected			1
the 40 - year - old went to his doctor complaining of the stench and having ' dirty ' armpit hair , which stained his clothes during summer			1
this is because there were ' creamy , yellow ' secretions on the hairs , according to the case report published in the @entity15			0
a @entity2 man suffered from extreme body odour because his armpit hair had become infected			2
he went to his doctor complaining of ' dirty ' , smelly armpits , which had ' creamy , yellow ' secretions on the hairs when doctors looked at the hairs under a microscope , they could see the secretions were only on the hair shaft , rather than penetrating it			1
the man was diagnosed with trichomycosis axillaris - a bacterial infection caused by the overgrowth of corynebacterium			1
the yellow , creamy secretions consist of tightly packed bacteria which prefer moist areas - hence why they gather in areas such as the armpit and groin			2
on closer inspection , 1 - 2 mm yellow , red or black nodules can also be found around the hair shaft , making the hair appear beaded or thicker			0
the rancid , acidic odour was caused by the bacteria metabolising testosterone - a hormone found in sweat - in sweat into pungent compounds , the researchers said			1

the man was treated by having the hair shaved off and with antibiotic cream the condition tends to affect men more than women , because many women shave or wax their armpit hair			0
obesity , excessive sweating and poor hygiene also increase the risk of developing the condition			0
treatment involved shaving the armpit hair off and an antibiotic cream and aluminum chloride being applied to the area , say the doctors at the @entity80 in @entity81			0
within a few weeks , the infection had cleared up and the condition does not have any long - lasting consequences .			0
