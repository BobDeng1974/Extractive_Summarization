by @entity0 published : 08:28 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 04:03 est , 15 may 2013 a top university has been criticised by students for spending £ 1.4m on famous artwork while raking in £ 9,000 tuition fees and paying staff less than the living wage			1
@entity7 spent the money while kitting out their new £ 50m @entity9 with works by @entity11 and @entity12			1
the building , which opened in october last year , now features a collection of work by @entity17 greats and pieces by north - east artists			0
@entity7 has been criticised for spending £ 1.4m on artwork			1
pictured is the @entity22 ( centre ) and @entity24 ( left ) at the university however , the decision to spend the money on the university 's new building has been criticised , with the students ' union calling the spending a ' total disgrace ' , while trade union @entity34 said it was ' appalling '			1
@entity35 , president of @entity36 , said : ' i can not believe that the university thinks it is appropriate to blow that much money on art. ' @entity40 is crucial			0
but this amount of money could be spent on student facilities , bursaries or , in fact , almost anything more worthwhile			2
in short , it is a total disgrace			1
' @entity7 has said developing its collections of graphic art and sculpture for public display was an ' essential ' ingredient of the concept for the @entity55 , which houses key student services and the @entity7 ’s headquarters			1
the spokesman said : ' @entity7 is a custodian of many fine treasures and developing our collections of graphic art and sculpture for public display was an essential part of the original concept for the @entity55			1
' some of the artwork was specially commissioned and reflects the university ’s academic strengths and the heritage of our region			0
the @entity55 ( pictured ) , which opened in october last year , now features a collection of work by @entity17 greats and pieces by @entity78 artists ' the works that can now be viewed in the @entity55 , in the adjacent @entity80 and nearby public spaces represent a rich and varied presentation of 20th and 21st century art. ' the university organises free guided tours of the collection and staff , students and members of the public are encouraged to come and enjoy it			1
' the @entity55 was part of the wider £ 60m @entity93 , funded through a mixture of capital grants from the @entity96 , university reserves , property disposals and bank borrowing			2
' £ 294k was provided within the original project budget under the “ per cent for art ” scheme ; the balance was funded from savings in the capital programme as a whole			0
' @entity7 student newspaper @entity107 fought to obtain figures as to how much the artwork costs after university chiefs hailed the quality of the art on display , but no costs were disclosed			2
its freedom of information ( @entity117 ) request was initially refused for ' security reasons ' , as @entity7 officials claimed they were worried that announcing the value of the works would increase the risk of them being stolen			0
in april last year , thieves broke into the university 's @entity125 and stole @entity128 artefacts worth about £ 2m			0
an internal review found the @entity117 refusal was overly cautious			0
because there was strong public interest in knowing how public money was spent , the decision was overturned			0
the university said £ 294,000 was originally budgeted for art but the ' marvellous spaces ' at the @entity9 led to a decision to buy more artworks			0
@entity7 has said developing its collections of graphic art and sculpture for public display was ' an essential part of the original concept for the @entity55 ' ( pictured is @entity147 and part of the university ) @entity149 , of the @entity34 union , said the university had 555 staff earning less than the living wage of £ 7.45 an hour			1
he said : ' it is appalling that @entity7 blatantly refuses to treat their lowest paid employees with some dignity ... but are able and willing to spend a fortune on works of art. ' the university said the average hourly rate of its lowest paid staff was above the living wage once overtime , shift allowances and other supplements were taken into account			2
the university said most of the art was freely accessible during normal opening hours and that all the items can be seen during free weekly tours .			0

@entity7 spent the money kitting out new £ 50m @entity55
students ' union has called the spending a ' total disgrace '
@entity34 meanwhile has described it as ' appalling '
