once a popular sight at weddings , ' celebratory shooting ' was outlawed by @entity8 's authorities in 2012 over fears it was killing bystanders			1
but some people have continued the practice despite the dangers			2

police have launched a crackdown on the tradition , deploying undercover patrol cars and shutting down some wedding ceremonies , according to local media and the @entity112			0
tradition : celebratory gunfire is not limited to the @entity31 world but has been an enduring tradition among some tribal communities			0
pictured : @entity119 tribesmen in @entity78 attend a wedding ceremony with their guns in 2007 stray bullets are nothing new - they were blamed for 20 deaths in 1991 when @entity125 citizens fired their weapons into the sky to celebrate the end of the @entity129			0
three more deaths reportedly ensued when @entity132 football fans shot into the air in @entity134 to celebrate the team defeating @entity136 in the 2007 @entity137			0
and guns firing into the air are not limited to the @entity31 world			0

last year ten - year - old @entity154 died in the early hours of @entity155 in @entity156 , @entity157 , after a neighbour fired a gun into the air during the festivities			0
from celebration to anger : firing guns into the air has been a tradition in many parts of the world , including @entity169 ( left ) in the wake of the 1999 war and the @entity172 ( right ) during a rally for the @entity176 @entity175 party six months later a seven - year - old boy was killed by a stray bullet as he walked to a july 4 fireworks display with his father in @entity181 , @entity182			2
@entity183 collapsed in the car park of a restaurant at about 9pm and doctors only realised he had a gunshot wound once he was being treated in hospital			0
@entity190 firearms expert @entity189 told @entity1 : ' if a bullet is fired into the air it will come down somewhere - it wo n't have the velocity or energy that it had when it left the barrel of the gun , but as is clearly evident , the energy can still be sufficient to cause death			2
' when the bullet falls it may not have the stabilising rotational effect imparted by the rifling of the barrel , and can tumble			0
' there is therefore an unknown element in that you ca n't predict whether the bullet will land sideways for instance , although the shape and type of the bullet has an effect			0
