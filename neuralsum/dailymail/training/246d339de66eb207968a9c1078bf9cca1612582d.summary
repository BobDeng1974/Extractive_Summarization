@entity0 is quick to interject			1
the question is about @entity3 ’s increased spending power , having signed @entity4 for £ 42million last season , @entity6 for £ 35m this summer , as well as @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			1
‘ let ’s not go overboard , ’ said @entity0 , interrupting			1
‘ we are more comfortable but we are not @entity12			1
’ sunday 's opponents in the @entity14 are the eternal reference point for the clubs who once ruled the @entity18 before the era of @entity21 oligarchs and energy - rich states upset the established order			1
they are also a constant irritant to @entity3			1
it is not just the procession of players who have gone there for better money and trophy - winning prospects : @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 ( ingloriously ) and now @entity47			2
there is even an @entity3 influence over the management at @entity12 in @entity51 and @entity52			1
the old jibes about being a feeder club are still raw and relevant			2
‘ well , @entity47 just left for @entity12 , so you ca n’t say those days are over , ’ says @entity55 when asked if the days of @entity12 dominating @entity3 might be past			1
‘ but you would think from the signings we have made ... ’ he does n’t finish the answer but it is put to him that players should believe they can achieve their ambitions at @entity3			1
‘ you would hope so , ’ says @entity55			2
big spenders : @entity9 ( left ) moved to @entity3 from @entity66 for £ 12million it is seemingly always a definitive season of late because performances were lacklustre for so long			1
@entity0 has his rehearsed and very reasonable defence for that			1
‘ the real pressure was first of all to keep the club financially capable to pay back the debt [ for the stadium ] and for that we needed to be in the @entity78 , ’ he said			2
‘ if i write my book i ’ll explain why that was the real pressure			2
’ @entity3 scrambled across the line to win the @entity82			2
@entity83 almost did for them in the final			2
you could say they demonstrated the mental strength that has been lacking over the years , or that the @entity82 papered over the cracks more easily seen in dreadful hammerings by @entity90 and @entity91			0
@entity92 is under pressure to deliver and there will still be departures , as @entity97 ’s £ 15m transfer to @entity98 proved			0
but @entity55 tries to sum up what a trophy can do			0
‘ the ceiling is higher			0
you just feel more responsible and more mature because you ’ve actually gone through quite a lot to get your hands on it , so you realise what it takes			0
i think the whole squad realises			0
’ in or out : @entity92 is not immune to being sold by the club , and there could still be departures this summer the aim : @entity12 won the @entity18 last season , their second title in three years a holding midfielder — maybe @entity114 or @entity115 or @entity116 — and another striker would make them more credible title contenders			1
but key men are already in place			0
@entity7 replaces @entity47 ; @entity122 , at centre - back today , is an exciting and youthful addition ; @entity124 is a keeper to challenge @entity126 while @entity6 could be the star striker craved since @entity128 ’s exit			0
‘ @entity6 is like an animal in training , ’ said @entity55			0
‘ he does n’t stop running			0
that is what we need			0
we ca n’t just sign a superstar and say , “ ok we ’re going to win everything ”			0
’ training against him , says @entity55 , is ‘ not the best day you ’re going to have ; he ’s a top player who will bring something extra ’ .			0

@entity0 says the club are not like @entity12 despite spending big
city have been a constant irritant to @entity3 having bought several of their players over the past few seasons
@entity3 face @entity12 in the @entity14 on sunday at @entity148
