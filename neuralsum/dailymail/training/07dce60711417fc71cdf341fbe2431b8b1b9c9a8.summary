by @entity0 published : 04:49 est , 27 february 2014 @entity2 : 06:52 est , 27 february 2014 @entity4 swimmer @entity3 has made no secret of the fact she dislikes the shape of her nose			0
now the i 'm a celebrity contestant is said to have had cosmetic surgery to give her the perfect profile			0
@entity3 's situation is one that 21 - year - old trainee optician @entity14 can identify with after she grew up hating a bump she had on her nose which made her paranoid about her appearance			1
but while @entity3 's nose looks lovely , @entity14 's bid for perfection went horribly wrong and left her nose even more misshapen than before			1
paranoid : @entity14 as a teenager when she was self - conscious about her nose desperate measures : @entity14 hated her profile so much she had a nose job when she was 18 which left her with scarring , right disguise : she was so paranoid about her nose she wore glasses even though she did n't need them ' i hated the fact i had a bigger nose than everyone else and there was a bump on the side of it , ' reveals @entity14			1
' when i first started driving i did n't want anyone to sit next to me in the passenger seat as they would then have a side ways view of me and my nose			0
everyone wants a perfect nose so i decided to have surgery			0
' the trainee optician decided to go under the knife when she was 18 , hoping that the operation would be the answer to her problems and rid her of insecurities			2
' i went to the cheapest place i could find and got it done , ' she admits			0
but the lack of research and the cheap deal resulted in a disastrously bungled operation			0
she was left with more lumps and bumps , a scar across the bridge of her nose and constantly had a bad smell in her nostrils			1
corrective surgery : @entity14 has now had the bump on the bridge of her nose removed , right ' i 've been left with more problems than when i first went in			1
i wish i had n't had it done			0
it looks horrendous , ' she said			0
@entity14 spent Â £ 2500 on the procedure but when she complained she was unhappy with her new look , she was told by the clinic to be patient and wait for the swelling and redness to go down			1
a year later with her nose still swollen , she returned to the clinic to be told the surgeon had fled the country			2
three years on , she still has to wear glasses to hide the bumps and scar on her nose despite having perfect vision			2
aside from the aesthetic problems she was left with after the inadequate rhinoplasty , @entity14 was also left with worrying physical complications			2
she said : ' now i get nose bleeds quite often , once every two days			1
' @entity14 agreed to appear on @entity87 show @entity88 to see if they could salvage her damaged nose			1
cosmetic surgeon dr @entity90 examined her and was alarmed to see her nostrils were inflamed and her nasal lining in tatters			2
now : the optician feels more confident and said she wo n't wear glasses anymore of her scar , he said : ' there is no reason to make an incision in the nose at the bridge which makes me think somebody slipped			0
it looks to me like the surgeon slipped with his chisel and put it straight through the skin			0
' dr @entity90 said @entity14 's only option was to go back under the knife so he could see what was going on beneath her skin following the previous botched op. swimmer @entity3 is said she have had a nose job he was shocked when he discovered the source of the bad scent @entity14 could constantly smell			1
the last surgeon had been so clumsy he had damaged @entity14 's respiratory lining , causing a cyst to form			1
this was a source of infection which was causing @entity14 's nose bleeds , discomfort and the bad smell			1
' that should n't be there , that 's not normal , ' dr @entity90 said on discovering the cyst			0
he was able to remove it and then strengthened out @entity14 's nose by realigning nasal cartilage on the top of the nose			1
commenting on the case , dr @entity138 of the @entity139 ( lcas.com ) said : ' the nose is a hugely important facial feature , so although this operation is straightforward anatomically , it requires the most meticulous surgical skills , and the aesthetic anticipation and perception of an artist , in order to form a new nose that will blend in and balance the whole face			2
' with a reputable surgeon performing rhinoplasty many problems can be reduced or corrected - long noses can be shortened , crooked noses straightened , bumps and hooks removed , wide noses can be narrowed , rounded tips removed and nostrils made smaller			1
' i would always advise finding a safe pair of hands when it comes to this delicate operation			0
' after her second operation done by dr @entity90 , @entity14 was delighted with the results			1
' when i used to look at my nose i could just see the lump , ' she reveals			0
' now it looks nice and straight			0
it makes me a lot more confident , i certainly wo n't be needing the spectacles anymore			0
' @entity14 appears on @entity88 , tonight at 8pm on @entity87			2
