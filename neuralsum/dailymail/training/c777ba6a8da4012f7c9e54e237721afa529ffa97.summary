@entity14 - style seafood was always the big seller at @entity7 's @entity11 restaurant , but the chef for many years had a secret passion - soil			1
gathering pace : a culinary trend of eating soil is gathering pace at a @entity6 restaurant idea : chef @entity7 uses dirt - based specialties alongside dishes at his @entity11 restaurant @entity12 his long interest in soil cuisine culminated in a feast that has been growing in popularity with his customers , starting with an amuse bouche of soil soup and ending with a soil sorbet			1
in an interview with website @entity35 he said his soil tastes ' actually like the @entity38 itself			2
' ' man did n't create the sea , the air or the soil			2
they 're simply all part of nature , and in a sense they are alive in their own right , ' said @entity7			1
' what i 'm trying to do is reflect that feeling in food			2
' a professional bantamweight boxer in his youth , @entity7 turned his hand to cooking in his twenties and left to train in @entity58			1
popularity : his long interest in soil cuisine culminated in a feast that has been growing in populairty with his customers , starting with an amuse bouche of soil soup and ending with a soil sorbet dining out : a diner samples a dish from @entity7 's soil menu vision : for the last 20 years he has run a @entity14 restaurant in downtown @entity11 , and over the last eight has been slowly introducing his customers to samples of soil - inspired cuisine in 2011 research emerged that suggests eating mud or clay could actually be good for the stomach			1
dining on dirt , or geophagy , is common among many cultures and has been reported in almost every country in the world			1
now more than 480 cultural accounts of the practice — by missionaries , plantation doctors and explorers — have been analysed by researchers at @entity92 in @entity93			2
while no one is suggesting that mud should be the new fad diet , the study , in the @entity98 , found the most plausible explanation for geophagy could be that earth acts as a shield against ingested parasites and plant toxins			2
people may also crave dirt because it provides nutrients they lack such as iron , zinc , or calcium , the research found			1
for the last 20 years he has run a @entity14 restaurant in downtown @entity11 , and over the last eight has been slowly introducing his customers to samples of soil - inspired cuisine			1
at first , though , the search for a clean and chemical - free main ingredient was tough work			1
' i had to go all over the place to find soil , into the mountains and places like that			1
places where there was no farming , ' he said			2
' then of course i had to dig it up from deep under the ground			2
' ' i buy 20 kilograms a month from @entity132 in @entity134 prefecture			2
i use black soil for most dishes and white soil — normally used for bonsai plants — for lighter food			1
the soil is taken from 10 miles underground and checked in a lab for impurities — pollution , contamination , lead			0
so it is already very safe when i buy it			0
soil is a pure living thing , a collection of microorganisms			0
anything bad about it , pollution or radiation contamination , is generally caused by humans , ' he told @entity35			0
after the dirt arrives , he lightly cooks it to release the flavour , then runs it through a sieve to remove any stray grains of sand			1
the six - course soil extravaganza starts with an amuse bouche of soil soup , served with the merest fleck of dirt - engrained truffle , and ends with soil sorbet and a sweet dirt gratin			1
but @entity7 's pride and joy is the ' soil surprise , ' a dirt - covered potato ball with a truffle center			1
the feast is not especially cheap , running to 10,000 yen ( $ 110 , £ 69 ) a diner			0
many are surprised by the unusual dining experience			0
' it was my first time to have soup made from soil , ' said @entity184 , a nearby resident			0
' it was a bit gritty but not at all unpleasant , a little like vegetable soup			0
' if @entity7 is to be believed , it 's healthy too			1
he says his soil aids the digestion and is full of healthy minerals			0
' humans used to eat soil , back in the day , ' he said , though he had to ruefully acknowledge that not all customers are fans			0
' animals eat is as well , so i suppose there 's this impression that soil 's a bit too dirty to eat			0
we do have some customers who completely avoid it			0

dr @entity236 , who led the study , said the first written account of human geophagy comes from @entity240 more than 2,000 years ago			0
the researchers said : ' we hope this paper stimulates more research			0
' more importantly , we hope readers agree it is time to stop regarding geophagy as a bizarre , non-adaptive gustatory mistake			0
' with these data , it is clear that geophagy is a widespread behaviour in humans that occurs during both vulnerable life stages and when facing ecological conditions that require protection .			0
