this is an edited transcript of @entity0 ’s interview by @entity67 : @entity68 : can we take it that if you discover that anyone who ’s given money to the @entity2 has been involved in aggressive tax avoidance , you give the money back ? @entity76 : i think the @entity2 would think twice about accepting money from people who fit the description you give ... @entity68 : no , simple question : if you ’ve taken it , will you give the money back ? @entity76 : well i ’m not aware that we have taken money from anybody who ’s engaged ... @entity68 : no , but if it emerged , would you give that money back ? @entity76 : well as i said , i think if @entity2 found out somebody was engaged in aggressive tax avoidance , it would think twice before taking the money ... @entity68 : but if you had taken the money , you ’d give it back ? @entity76 : i ’m not aware that we have taken it ... @entity68 : answer the question			1
