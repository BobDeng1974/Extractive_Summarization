' @entity17 and @entity2 toured the @entity19 research centre in @entity20 , one of the two states that make up the @entity24 part of @entity9			1
while her outfits on the tour have so far have included designs by @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 , the @entity2 was dressed for the jungle in slim - cut beige jeans and a plaited brown leather belt , sturdy walking boots and a sheer green blouse over a black t - shirt			1

he said : ' they enjoyed it immensely , they asked lots of questions about primates , birds and insects , and @entity2 was taking a lot of photos			1
' on arriving at the field centre , the couple attended a short briefing with a group of @entity24 and @entity117 scientists , including dr @entity118 , the director of the @entity63 ’s @entity120 research programme , which explores the impact of deforestation in the region and dr @entity125 from @entity126			2
they were then fitted with special harnesses and helmets in a private room before being hoisted 42 metres up into a giant parashorea tomentella tree			0

' i hope i do n’t have any wardrobe malfunctions			1
' he also added : " it 's not quite as impressive as the @entity155			0
when dr @entity118 joked : ' size is n't everything , ' the @entity1 responded : ' that 's true			1
' @entity163 , appearing somewhat apprehensive as she looked upwards at her route of ascent into the jungle canopy , said : ' i ’m going to go “ whee ” and just fly up			0
' @entity165 , the rope access technician who oversaw their ascent up the tree , said : “ it ’s the closest anyone will ever get to time travel			0
' what they are seeing is exactly what it would have looked like 150 million years ago as there has never been an ice age here			0
it is as if time stood still			0
” ready for action : @entity17 and kate laughed and joked as they toured the rainforest casual look : no designer dresses for @entity2 who wore tight - fitting jeans with a leather belt and green shirt suspended in the air , with sweeping views over the top of the jungle canopy , they were greeted up the tree by @entity197 , 32 , from @entity20 , who completed a phd in entomology at @entity200 two years ago and is now based at the field centre			1
miss @entity197 said : “ they just said it was such a surreal , totally unique experience up there because they had never been up in the canopy			0
“ they enjoyed it immensely and they were n’t scared of the heights			0
they asked about the primates , birds and insects and they were interested in how the forest is sustained			0
“ they enjoyed it because it gets them into the midst of the canopy , where there ’s nothing much else going on			0
” after spending around 10 minutes up in the air , they were lowered back down to the ground , with wide smiles , clearly stunned by what they had seen			0
the @entity1 said : ' that was amazing			1
' goodbye : @entity2 waves to the crowds at @entity236 airport before the royal couple depart after their visit ' that was rather surreal , was n’t it ? ' said the @entity2			1
' it was amazing , such a treat , really brilliant to be up there			0
i could have stayed up there for hours , even though there were a lot of ants			0
” the @entity1 wryly joked that even high up in the jungle canopy , he could not escape a photographer who had been positioned high up in an adjacent tree			1
' we saw a spy in a tree , ' he said , before thanking the rope technicians : ' thank you for keeping us safe , that was super			0
' the couple then took a jungle walk with dr @entity118 , who had offered them the use of ' leech socks ' , which the @entity1 and @entity2 politely declined			1
' apparently they did n’t pass the sartorial test , ' said dr @entity118			0
but moments later , the @entity2 may have wished she had taken dr @entity118 up on his offer , as a jungle leech attached itself to her leg			1
' she dealt with it very calmly and just bent down and picked it off			0
' the @entity1 and @entity2 then visited the field centre ’s laboratory , where they met with representatives and academics from @entity277 , the @entity278 , and @entity126			1

staking up : closer magazines displayed at the the company 's headquarter , in @entity302 , near to @entity303 the @entity1 asked : “ @entity304 quite social animals ? do they have big families or are they solitary ? ” @entity163 was also inquisitive about their mating habits , asking : ' do they have any young at the moment ? we ’re very jealous [ when the scientists said often see them ]			2
we still have n’t managed to see one			0
' the couple also looked at a selection of pressed jungle flowers and leaves			2
' do you press the leaves here yourself ? ' said the @entity2			2
her husband then joked : ' she ’ll now ask you all about how you do it – she ’s very arty			0
' in an attempt to enjoy some much - needed privacy , the @entity1 and @entity2 then retired privately to the lodge for the afternoon , where they were served an eight - course lunch of @entity20 delicacies including fern salad with coconut and chicken soup cooked in sweet traditional local rice wine			1
after lunch , much to their delight , they were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of an @entity280 family , a mother , father and their baby , while with a guide from the lodge			0
the couple have vowed not to let the furore over a magazine 's decision to publish topless pictures of the @entity343 derail their nine - day @entity345 tour of @entity120 and the @entity346			1
the say they are determined to press ahead with their high profile visit			2
a source close to @entity17 and @entity2 , said they felt intense anger and disappointment at what had happened but believed very strongly that the tour was far too important to @entity117 interests abroad to be allowed to suffer			1
' @entity1 and @entity2 are hugely disappointed by what has happened but both feel very strongly that it should be business as usual , ' the source said			1
' they feel it has been a great success so far and have thoroughly enjoyed the places they have visited and the people they have met			0
' even yesterday , when they were reeling from the shock of what happened , their smiles were entirely genuine			0
' they are determined to press ahead and that it should be business as usual			2
