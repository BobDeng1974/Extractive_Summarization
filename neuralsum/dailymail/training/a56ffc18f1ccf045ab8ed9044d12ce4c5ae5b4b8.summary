@entity0 has mended fences with @entity2 and ' looks forward to hugging it out ' at a swanky party , according to her spokesman , just days after the publication of an interview in which she had harsh words for the president 's handling of the crisis in @entity12			1
speaking last week to the @entity13 , the former secretary of state said @entity2 's ' failure ' to arm rebels opposed to dictator @entity17 ' left a big vacuum , which the jihadists have now filled			2
' she was referring to the murderous terror group @entity21 , which has left a swath of death and destruction in its wake as it plows through @entity26 and claims to have established an @entity28 caliphate			0
a @entity30 spokesman , however , said tuesday that she had ' called president @entity2 to make sure he knows that nothing she said was an attempt to attack him , his policies , or his leadership			1
' awkward : @entity0 wants to ' hug it out ' with her former boss and mend fences agfter she publicly criticized his foreign policy not party attire : mrs. @entity0 was photographed in an unflattering muumuu on a beach in @entity44 before leaving for a book signing on @entity46 , where the @entity47 are vacationing the statement , delivered first to @entity49 , acknowledged that @entity30 and @entity2 have ' had honest differences on some issues , including aspects of the wicked challenge @entity12 presents			1
' but ' [ l ] ike any two friends who have to deal with the public eye , she looks forward to hugging it out when she they see each other tomorrow night			0
' that could take the edge off of what would otherwise be an awkward encounter at a party wednesday night on @entity46			0
the event will honor @entity64 , wife of @entity66 adviser @entity65			0
@entity30 , whose reputation as a calculating politician precedes her , is likely to be seen as a craftily playing both sides of the political fence			0
distancing herself from an increasingly unpopular foreign policy will help her among moderates who have tired of a middle - path @entity2 @entity74 that declines major engagements and , some argue , has given @entity78 adversaries room to run			1
but publicly seeking reconciliation before a social gathering whose attendees have loose tongues and deep pockets and could simultaneously ingratiate her among far - left @entity66 who are shopping for a candidate who will stay @entity2 's course for four or eight more years			1
@entity30 's press flack emphasized on tuesday that she shares @entity2 's ' deep commitment to a smart and principled foreign policy that uses all the tools at our disposal to achieve our goals			1
' the former diplomat is on the @entity99 island for a book - signing session ; the @entity47 are in the midst of a two - week vacation			0
it was unclear whether former president @entity30 also planned to attend the party			2
in her @entity13 interview , @entity30 drew the sharpest distinctions yet between herself and @entity2 in a rebuke of his cautious approach to global crises			2
' great nations need organizing principles , and " do n't do stupid stuff ' is not an organizing principle , ' she said , referring to a version of the phrase @entity2 and his advisers have used privately to describe his approach to foreign policy			1
asked for her organizing principle , she replied : ' peace , progress and prosperity			0
this worked for a very long time			0
' @entity30 wrapped her critiques in expressions of respect for the president and sympathy for the tough global decisions he grapples with from the @entity134			0
on monday , a vacation day for @entity2 , he dealt with issues involving @entity26 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity12 , as well as terrorism and @entity140 in @entity141			0
' he 's thoughtful , he 's incredibly smart , and able to analyze a lot of different factors that are all moving at the same time , ' she said			0
' i think he is cautious because he knows what he inherited , both the two wars and the economic front , and he has expended a lot of capital and energy trying to pull us out of the hole we 're in			0
' however , @entity30 offered an uncompromising defense of @entity156 's battle against @entity157 in @entity138 and argued against @entity2 's decision not to build up a rebel fighting force to confront @entity12 president @entity17			1
president @entity2 is currently on vacation on the island of @entity46			0
on wednesday he and @entity0 will attend the same get - together just a few days after she slammed @entity2 's approach to @entity12 in an interview @entity0 signs copies of her book hard choices in @entity169 , @entity170 last wednesday			1
@entity30 will be in @entity46 this week for another book signing @entity30 previously described her advocacy for the @entity12 rebellion in her recently released book @entity175 , a slow - selling memoir about her time leading the @entity178			2
@entity2 has said supporting the rebels would not have stopped @entity181 - inspired groups from rampaging across @entity12 and inside @entity26 today			2
@entity30 and then - defense secretary @entity182 reportedly argued for arming the rebels who first stood up to @entity17 three years ago			2
since then , the question of ' arming the rebels ' has become more complicated , as fighters linked to @entity181 and other fundamentalist @entity186 groups have joined the rebellion			0
the @entity74 declined to respond to @entity30 's comments in the @entity13 , but said her team gave them a heads - up before the interview was published			1
@entity30 , who lost to @entity2 in the 2008 democratic presidential primary , has not said definitively whether she will run in 2016			2
but her decision to sit down for an in - depth interview about her foreign policy vision and to distinguish herself from the unpopular incumbent for whom she worked is the latest signal she 's seriously preparing for a bid			1
@entity203 say she wo n't be able to escape that she carried out @entity2 's foreign policy for his first term without public complaint			1
' @entity0 spent four years executing @entity2 's foreign policy , and in year five of @entity2 's term it 's ridiculous for @entity0 to try to swindle voters into thinking what 's happening around the world is n't a product of @entity2 - @entity0 diplomacy , ' @entity208 spokesperson @entity207 said in response to @entity30 's interview .			1

in an interview released over the weekend @entity30 slammed @entity2 's ' do n't do stupid stuff ' approach to foreign policy
wednesday party will be first in - person meeting since @entity30 's comments were published
as *rumors* of a rift *swirled* around @entity232 , a @entity30 spokesman said the two had reconciled
@entity0 , he said , ' looks forward to hugging it out '
