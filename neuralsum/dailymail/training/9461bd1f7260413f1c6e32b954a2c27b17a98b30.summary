by @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity4 reporter published : 15:06 est , 21 november 2012 updated : 03:10 est , 22 november 2012 a low - end clothing dealer was arrested wednesday in the killings of three @entity9 shopkeepers , police said			1
@entity10 , 63 , of @entity11 , confessed to two of the killings after turning himself in to police , according to the @entity15			1
' he puts himself at all three scenes , ' a source told the @entity15			1
' the motive is still unclear			2
@entity10 carried clothing in the duffel bag , which he had tried to tried to sell to the shopkeepers , police said			1
police recovered a bag containing a sawed - off rifle believed to have been used in the killings			1
the other killings happened in july and august			1
all three shopkeepers were men alone in stores that had no video cameras			1
after being questioned by detectives for hours , @entity41 admitted to the slayings of @entity44 , 65 , in @entity45 and @entity46 , 59 , in @entity47			1
weapon : police say that @entity10 used this rifle to kill three @entity52 shop keepers in the most recent killing , @entity53 , an @entity54 , was shot three times in the head and chest at his store , the @entity60			1
after that killing , detectives discovered the same gun was used in the fatal shootings of two other shopkeepers when ballistics matched the .22 - caliber gun shell casings on all three			1
on july 6 , @entity44 , an @entity67 , was found shot in the back of his shop , @entity71 on aug. 6 , @entity72 , also @entity67 , was shot in the head in his store , amazing 99 @entity75			1
the suspect was taken into police custody after he voluntarily entered the @entity78 in @entity45			2
he was later transferred to another police location for additional questioning			0
revealed : the balding , mustachioed man dubbed ' @entity83 ' who was seen near at least two crime scenes in @entity9 voluntarily submitted himself for questioning tuesday ballistics tests matched in each killing , all of which occurred in @entity9 shops with an ' 8 ' in the address			1
@entity41 was caught on surveillance footage a block and a half away from the @entity96 store where @entity53 was killed on friday evening			1
minutes later , the same moustachioed - man is seen in a different video two blocks away from the store			0
murdered : @entity101 was killed with three gunshots , but it seems nothing was stolen the @entity15 reports that a different surveillance camera , located by the scene of the second murder in @entity47 also shows the same man			2
the video is of poorer quality , but they feel confident that the same duffel bag - toting man was in the area around the time that shopkeeper @entity46 was killed on august 2			0
‘ ” @entity116 ” wore a long overcoat and carried a duffel bag , ’ police commissioner @entity115 said			0
‘ he was seen in the vicinity of @entity53 ’s store just after 6 p.m. the shop owner ’s body was found at 7.11pm			2
’ this is not the first person - of - interest in the case , and a number have since been ruled out			0
previously unidentified suspects , dubbed ‘ @entity128 ’ and ‘ @entity129 ’ , were on the police ’s watch list since they were seen in the area of @entity53 ’s shop at the time of the murder			0
they have since been eliminated from the suspect pool as it turns out that ‘ @entity128 ’ stole a bottle of perfume from street vendor ‘ @entity129 ’ who was chasing after her following the theft			0
two remaining possibilities are ‘ @entity144 ’ , a woman who was seen near the crime scene wearing sunglasses and a scarf			2
looking for the man : he appeared near at least two of the three crime scenes over the past four months near the scene : none of the stores where the shootings took place had video cameras inside there also was a police sketch released following the first murder that took place earlier in the summer at a 99 cent store that left @entity44 dead on july 6			1
that possible suspect was a man with dark skin and wearing sunglasses , who witnesses described as being ‘ disturbed ’ and talking to himself about putting a bullet in someone ’s head			0
that man is said to be roughly 5 - foot - 5 and around 140 pounds			0
the @entity173 reports that the shop owner @entity174 was behind the counter of she she in @entity9 's @entity96 section when he was shot friday night			0
the gunman dragged the victim 's body toward the back of the store and covered it with clothing			0
victims : @entity46 and @entity44 were killed by the same handgun earlier this year police found the 78 - year - old with two gunshot wounds to the head and one to the torso , @entity186 reported			1
on the floor of the shop were the killer 's calling card : shell casings matching casings left at the scenes of the last two homicides			1
' now it 's like he 's telling us , ' it 's me again , '' a police source told the @entity173			0
casings that police have matched to two other murders			2
“ now it ’s like he ’s telling us , ‘ it ’s me again , ’ ” a police source said			0
the way @entity101 's body was hidden was also consistent with the previous shootings			0
on july 6 , @entity44 , 65 , was found shot through the neck in his @entity45 clothing shop			2
his body was also hidden			0
police believe the methodical killer does this to buy himself more getaway time by delaying the discovery of the bodies			2
' i hope they catch the son of a b * * * * , ' @entity44 's son , @entity225 said			0
when @entity232 did n't come home at the usual time friday his family called the police , who discovered his body			0
it was n't not clear if the killer actually took anything , or if the murder was his sole motivation			2
' he never had in his whole life one enemy , he did n't have , he was a very kind man , ' his sobbing wife , @entity242 , told reporters			0
suspect : following one homicide at a 99 cent store that used the same gun , police released this sketch of the suspect he was supposed to be at his grandson ’s @entity253 on saturday			0
police believe the murderer had been watching the store in preparation for the attack , noting that he 'd chosen a shop with no security cameras			1
@entity262 , 59 , was found dead in his @entity47 store at 1877 86th st. , was shot in the head and stabbed in the neck			2
besides owning stores , each victim was of @entity269 descent , prompting suspicion the killer could be racially motivated			1
it appeared nothing was taken from @entity101 's shop but both @entity72 and @entity44 had money taken from them , and it remains unclear whether robbery is a motive			0
unguarded : believe the killer was attracted to the store because , as with previous crime scenes , there were no cameras @entity282 of the @entity283 of the @entity284 said they were sending copies of the police sketch to their members but were mostly concerned with those fitting the previous victim 's description			1
' the only members that we would be concerned about are @entity269 , ' he said			0
it 's also possible the killer has a fascination with numerology , as the address for each homicide includes the number 8 : @entity72 at 1877 86th st. , @entity44 at 7718 5th ave. , and @entity101 at 834 @entity302 none of the stores had working surveillance cameras			1
scene : police believe the killer may have been casing the shop , as it had no security cameras to catch him in the act neighbors called @entity232 a ' neighborhood staple			1
' ' he was a regular guy , ' said customer @entity315			0
' he never hurt nobody			0
' police are offering $ 12,000 for any information leading to the killer 's arrest and conviction			2
video : surveillance shows ' @entity83 ' near two different crime scenes			1

@entity10 , of @entity11 , arrested in killings of three shopkeepers
@entity41 ' confesses to two of the killings '
casings from the same .22 caliber handgun found at all three crime scenes
killer may have chosen stores based on lack of surveillance cameras
