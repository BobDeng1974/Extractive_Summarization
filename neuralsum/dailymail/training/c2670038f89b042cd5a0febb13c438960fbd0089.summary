the contentious moment of the game was @entity2 not being given offside when he scored the second goal			1
@entity2 was not offside when the initial cross was sent in by @entity5 towards @entity6 but he was when the @entity7 headed the ball			1
at full speed it was impossible to be 100 per cent certain that @entity11 had touched the ball			2
@entity2 should have been given offside but it was a tough call for the officials @entity6 got a slight flick on the way through but it was almost impossible to know that at full speed the assistant referee was @entity21 , who has experience of officiating in a @entity24 final			1
he did n’t flag and i could see exactly why he did n’t ! perhaps better communication between the referee , @entity28 , and @entity21 could have led to the correct outcome			0
but given the weekend of poor decisions , this was a minor and understandable incident			0
it was only clear when @entity11 himself admitted heading the ball in a post-match interview			0

given the weekend of poor decisions , this was a minor and understandable incident for @entity28 @entity41 not concerned with title talk			0

@entity2 scored @entity38 *'s* second goal against @entity45
@entity6 got a flick on the cross which meant @entity2 was offside
but at full speed it was impossible for the officials to be certain of this
