we 've had up - scaled burgers , hot dogs and fish and chips but up to now , the poor beleaguered kebab has been left well alone			1
the much - maligned @entity7 staple is now getting a makeover thanks to @entity9 and @entity10 , who have opened ' premium kebab destination ' @entity12 that has 24 - hour marinated veal shoulder kebab on the menu costing £ 8.40			1
luxed - up kebab : slow cooked lamb shoulder with feta , mango pickle and fresh dill tahini yoghurt the ' premium kebab destination ' @entity12 is on @entity22 , @entity23 ' everyone knows that you can go down to @entity26 or @entity27 and have a great sit down kebab at a @entity7 or @entity30 restaurant , ' said co-founder @entity9			1
' but unfortunately there are also lots of kebab restaurants around the @entity33 that treat the food with less reverence , and accordingly the kebab 's reputation is n't great over here			1
' people associate them with the drunken walk home from the pub , and we want to dispel that stereotype once and for all and create something really tasty and healthy that people can eat quickly at lunchtime as well as in the evening			0
' a world away from the usual kebab shops : @entity12 's pared down menu has five options ' i have a hunch that the average doner kebab is going to get a makeover			1
think house made wraps and decent meat cooked on wood grills and in smokers and you get the idea , ' @entity57 , head chef of the @entity59 's @entity58 said to @entity67			1
and he may be right			0
kebabs , which have long been associated with a quick way to soak up the alcohol after a drunken binge are the latest food to be luxed up in @entity23			1
they appear on the menu at @entity75 ( minced lamb marinated with lime , coriander and cumin )			2
@entity80 , founder of @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 has opened @entity7 restaurant @entity85 on @entity87 serving kebabs , and there are rumours that @entity92 ’s business partner @entity91 is planning to launch a fast - food business that revolves around kebabs			0
the restaurant seats 25 people but almost 70 per cent of its custom comes from takeaway orders , mr @entity9 said			0
' it 's a fast casual restaurant , the type of place like @entity102 or @entity103 or @entity104 , ' he explained to @entity67			0
' we have seating for 25 people but 70 per cent of people take away			0
' the key is to change the perception of the kebab away from something fit only for the stagger home from the pub into something fresh , healthy and an acceptable lunch meal			2
' when most women hear the word kebab they shudder as they think of the greasy doner on a spot			2
we like to think our kebabs will be as popular with women as they will with men , ' he said			0
