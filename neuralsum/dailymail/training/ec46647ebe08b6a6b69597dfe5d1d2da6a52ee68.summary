more armed police will patrol @entity3 ’s streets to counter the threat posed by fanatics returning from @entity6 and @entity7 , @entity0 announced yesterday			1
he warned that the return of hundreds of murderous extremists posed a greater threat to our security than @entity13 or the @entity14 ever did			1
his comments came as @entity16 announced the official terror threat level had been raised to ‘ severe ’ – the second - highest state – for the first time in three years			1
he called for the public to be vigilant but added they should not panic , saying @entity3 had shown ‘ resolve ’ in the face of terror before			2
he also pledged to introduce ‘ uncompromising ’ new laws to plug ‘ gaps in our armoury ’ in dealing with the threat posed by @entity41 extremists , including enhanced powers to remove the passports of radicalised @entity44 seeking to join the fighting in the @entity46			1
proposals to remove the passports of extremists who have already gone abroad are also being examined			2
the home secretary said the intelligence services now believe a terror attack in @entity3 is ‘ highly likely ’ , although she stressed there was no information about any specific plot			1
‘ the increase in the threat level is related to developments in @entity7 and @entity6 where terrorist groups are planning attacks against the @entity65 , ’ mrs may said			1
‘ some of those plots are likely to involve foreign fighters who have travelled there from the @entity3 and @entity69 to take part in those conflicts			2
’ @entity3 intelligence officers believe at least 500 @entity3 citizens have travelled to @entity7 and @entity6 to wage jihad , of which about half have returned to this country			1
some experts believe the true figure may be far higher			0
mr @entity0 gave few details of the planned crackdown to combat this threat , which will be revealed to mps on monday			1
@entity84 was under intense pressure last night to cease his opposition to new terror laws			2
@entity89 sources insisted mr @entity84 had not ruled out beefing up powers to keep the public safe			0
but they warned he would not allow ‘ civil liberties ’ to be trampled on			0
a source said : ‘ @entity84 takes the terror threat very seriously			1
he welcomes the prime minister ’s rejection of a knee - jerk response and will look calmly at any new proposals			0
’ the two men are said to have discussed the outline of the proposals and will try to thrash out the details this weekend , before unveiling them when parliament returns on monday			0
there was speculation at @entity106 that mr @entity0 ’s dramatic statement yesterday was designed partly to bounce mr @entity84 into dropping his opposition			1
mr @entity84 has repeatedly acted as a roadblock to the introduction of tough new measures designed to keep the public safe			0
he has argued that many of the measures supported by the security services are illiberal and disproportionate			0
the @entity89 leader has boasted of blocking the so - called ‘ @entity117 ’ , which would allow the security services to gather details of every email and phone call			0
that is despite warnings from the police and intelligence services that it is needed to keep track of suspects			0
mr @entity0 's statement today came after the home secretary @entity16 said an attack on the @entity3 was ' highly likely ' critical - an attack is expected imminently severe - an attack is highly likely substantial - an attack is a strong possibility moderate - an attack is possible but not likely low - an attack is unlikely he insisted he would not introduce ‘ knee - jerk ’ measures in response to the threat			1
but he said existing powers to strip radicalised @entity44 of their passports will be beefed up , to prevent more travelling to the region to fight			0
rules introduced last year have so far resulted in the removal of just 23 passports			0
the prime minister said he also wanted to see more action to prevent extremists returning from the region			0
however , he gave few details , saying only that police needed powers to deal ‘ decisively ’ with those who have returned			0
experts speculated that this will mean strengthening @entity159 and @entity160 ( @entity161 ) , designed to make it easier for police to keep tabs on terror suspects			0
critics say the measures , introduced after draconian control orders were thrown out by the courts , are too weak to be effective			0
mr @entity0 is considering whether to add a requirement for suspects to remain at a known address			1
@entity161 subjects could even be ordered to attend de-radicalisation sessions			0
ministers are also examining whether to revive plans for the so - called @entity177 , which would allow the intelligence services to log details of every phone call and email , despite opposition from civil liberties campaigners and @entity84			0
@entity185 chief @entity184 earlier this week claimed the ' drum beat ' of terror had increased in addition , mr @entity0 is pushing for new @entity190 laws to require countries to share air passenger data , to make it easier to track and intercept suspected extremists heading for @entity7			1
the prime minister told a press conference in @entity197 that @entity3 is facing a ‘ generational battle ’ against ‘ poisonous ’ @entity22 extremists which is likely to last for decades			2
he said @entity200 was unlike any previous terrorist threat because it had effectively established a state from which it could eventually mount attacks on the @entity65			2
‘ in @entity204 the @entity24 were prepared to play host to @entity13 , the terrorist organisation			2
with [ @entity200 ] we are facing a terrorist organisation not being hosted in a country but seeking to establish and then violently expand its own terrorist state			1
‘ with designs on expanding up to the @entity212 border , we could be facing a terrorist state on the shores of the @entity215 and bordering a @entity217 member			1
’ despite this warning , he played down the prospect of joining the @entity221 in direct military action			0
the @entity223 brought in a new warning system to alert the public to the threat posed by @entity13 and other terror groups in the wake of the july 7 terror atrocity			1
when it was first published on august 1 , 2006 , the threat stood at severe - the second highest level			2
but just over a week later , on august 10 , the threat was raised to critical after police exposed a plot to manufacture and smuggle parts of explosives on to passenger jets flying between the @entity3 and the @entity221 , and detonate them on board			1
counter terrorism police smashed the terror ring , arresting its members in a raid codenamed @entity244 , and on august 13 the threat level was lowered to severe , where it stayed for around a year			1
@entity3 was plunged into a fresh state of heightened alert and the terror threat was raised to critical on june 30 , 2007 , after a blazing car loaded with propane canisters was driven into a crowded @entity252			1
the attack came just one day after two bombs were discovered in cars in @entity257 's @entity256 and @entity258 - among the capital 's busiest tourist spots			0
police quickly arrested @entity264 extremist @entity262 , a man behind the two attempted attacks			0
and on july 4 2007 the threat level was lowered to severe , where it stood for two years before being lowered again on july 20 2009 to substantial			2
but the perils of terrorism came to the forefront again when on christmas day 2009 the now - notorious underwear bomber @entity271 tried to blow up a jumbo jet as it flew to @entity274 in the @entity221			2
tragedy was only averted when brave passengers overpowered the @entity277 , and terror chiefs decided to raise the @entity3 threat level on january 22 , 2010 , to severe			1
it stood at severe for 18 months before being lowered on july 11 2011 to substantial , where it stood for three years			0
today home secretary @entity283 announced the terror threat is again being raised to severe in the wake of warnings of the deadly threat posed by @entity3 jihadists radicalised fighting for @entity41 extremists in @entity7 and @entity6			1
the level is set by the @entity291 and the @entity292 , which operates out of @entity292 .			0

the ' terrorist state ' is more dangerous than @entity13 , mr @entity0 said
@entity296 announced new laws will be introduced to remove extremists ' passports
threat level raised amid fears over @entity3 jihadis returning from @entity6 and @entity7
but @entity16 says no evidence to *suggest* that an attack is imminent
@entity308 says it is unlikely that the @entity221 terror threat will be increased
up to *600* @entity3 extremists have travelled to the @entity46 to join @entity23
around *300* @entity3 - linked terrorists are thought to have returned to @entity3
