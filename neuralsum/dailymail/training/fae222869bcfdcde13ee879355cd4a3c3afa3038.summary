by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 01:57 est , 2 may 2013 a funeral director today gave families a chance to collect the ashes of their loved ones - before the remains of more than 150 bodies are scattered on their behalf			1
urns containing the remains of the many bodies have been stacking up over the years at @entity12 branches in @entity13 , @entity14 , as families fail to collect them after cremation			1
the funeral directors , which have been operating for more than 100 years , even have some remains dating back to the 1950s - but now hope to reunite some of the deceased with their loved ones			1
‘ however , we understand that there are many reasons why families may choose to keep the ashes in our care			0
for some , collecting them is too painful			0
' others simply need more time to decide what to do with them			0
with so many uncollected after such a considerable amount of time , we decided to launch the appeal			0
‘ we hope it will encourage families to come forward and visit one of our branches if they have specific wishes for the unclaimed ashes or would like to talk to a member of our team about the options available			2
‘ we 're keen to stress that this is n't about recently bereaved families or those who have asked us to keep ashes on their behalf for a specific reason , perhaps until they , too , die			0
in store : the funeral directors , which have been operating for more than 100 years , even have some remains dating back to the 1950s - but now hope to reunite some of the deceased with their loved ones urns : mr @entity22 said every individual should get ' the opportunity of a peaceful final resting place ' ‘ this is about ashes that have been left unclaimed for a considerable amount of time			1
we believe it 's only right that every individual is given the opportunity of a peaceful final resting place			0
' we believe it 's only right that every individual is given the opportunity of a peaceful final resting place ' @entity22 , funeral director ‘ so for those that have already been in our care for more than five years and remain unclaimed following this appeal , our team will hold a special service and scatter each set of ashes in a local garden of remembrance			2
’ the @entity92 of @entity93 has specific guidelines in place for unclaimed ashes , and recommends its members store them for a minimum of five years			1
mr @entity22 added : ‘ having done this and rigorously searched for family members , the team at @entity101 decided to take a different course of action by launching the appeal			2
