january is the most miserable month of the year			1
@entity0 is over , we 're recovering from a month of lavish eating , drinking and spending - and there is no end in sight to the cold , dark mornings			2
so @entity8 has teamed up with happiness experts @entity9 and @entity11 to provide a plan to keep the january blues away			1
the challenge is to do the exercises daily until they become happiness habits			1
read on to learn how to beat the winter blues : 1 january : upgrade your knickers so every bit of underwear oozes confidence			1
stop saving your special pants for a special occasion and wake up to the fact that life is the ultimate special occasion			2
2 january : do an act of kindness for someone else			1
this can be as simple as letting someone out in the traffic or buying flowers for the bus driver			2
3 january : catch somebody doing something well and tell them			1
for example , make a point of thanking someone who gives good customer service or thank your teenager for bringing the plates and cups down from their room			2
your fanciest pants are n't just for special occasions			2
breaking out your best underwear will boost confidence 4 january : practice the 10/5 principle , for instance , smile at everyone who comes within 10 feet of you and make eye contact and say ‘ hi ’ to everyone within five feet ( except on the tube			1
i tried it and nearly got arrested )			2
5 january : say nice things about people behind their back			1
this is a double whammy because it gets back to them plus people think you ’re a lovely person ( which , of course , you are )			2
6 january : write a list of ten things you really appreciate but take for granted			1
‘ health ’ and ‘ relationships ’ will almost certainly be on there			2
stop taking them for granted ! 7 january : every morning , appreciate that you do n’t have toothache and that your kidneys are working			1
being able to get out of bed is the best thing ever			2
8 january : write a list of the top ten happiest moments of your life and you ’ll realise that most of the things on the list are ‘ experiences ’ rather than ‘ products ’			1
set your stall out to have more experiences			0
write a list of the ten things you really appreciate but take for granted like ' health ’ and ‘ relationships ’ 9 january : think of someone who has really helped you , perhaps given you time or supported you			1
write them a letter from the heart , that says how wonderful they are and what they mean to you			0
read it to them ( i dare you )			0
10 january : instead of asking your partner / kids ‘ how was your day ? ’ change the words and ask ( with enthusiasm ) , ‘ what was the highlight of your day ? ’ then listen with genuine enthusiasm			1
11 january : walk tall and put a smile on your face ( not an inane grin , you will scare people			1
) your brain will immediately think you are happy and you ’ll feel a whole lot better			0
12 january : change your aim			1
stop setting your sights on ‘ getting through the week ’ or ‘ surviving until my next holiday ’			0
set your aim to ‘ enjoy the week ’ or ‘ to inspire people ’			0
13 january : write down your top five personal strengths			1
be aware of them and start seeing opportunities to play to them more often			0
14 january : reduce your moaning - as a @entity147 , it ’s almost impossible to stop completely - and always remind yourself it 's a first world problem			1
reduce your moaning ( as a @entity147 , it ’s a national passtime ) and remind yourself it 's a @entity151 problem 15 january : when setbacks occur , ask yourself , where is this issue on a scale of one to ten ( where ten is death )			1
if it is death , you are allowed to feel down			0
anything else , get over it			0
16 january : most people have an internal voice that is very critical			1
when your inner voice is telling you you ’re an idiot , firmly disagree			0
find a positive inner voice			0
note , this conflict is best done in silence in your head			0
and if you have lots of inner voices , you need to see your gp			0
17 january : spend less time on electronic friends and more time with real flesh and blood ones			1
18 january : say ‘ yes ’ to things , all day			1
19 january : praise your children for effort rather than ability			1
so , for example , if they get a good grade in maths do n’t say , ‘ genius , you are the next @entity185			0
’ do say , ‘ brilliant ! that shows what you can achieve with hard work			0
’ spend less time on electronic friends and more time with the real flesh and blood people in your life 20 january : practice the four - minute rule ; that is , be your best self for the first four minutes of arriving at work , being in a meeting or getting home			1
21 january : lose the word ‘ try ’			1
instead of setting a resolution of ‘ i ’m going to try and lose some weight ’ or ‘ i ’m going to try and get a bit fitter ’ , go with ‘ i ’m going to lose some weight ’ or ‘ i ’m going to get fitter ’			0
@entity205 was spot on when he said ‘ do or do not , there is no ‘ try ’			0
22 january : appreciate that your happiness is bigger than you			1
it has a ripple effect and infects people three degrees removed from you			0
23 january : read a bedtime story to your kids like it is the most exciting book in the world			1
24 january : reframe situations			1
for example , a leaking gutter means you have a house ; paying tax means you have some income and your teenage son spending hours on his x-box means he ’s not wandering the streets			0
( but do n’t overdo reframing otherwise you become @entity227 ; ‘ @entity234 , grandma ’s died , what a fabulous opportunity for a funeral and some lovely sandwiches ’ is almost certainly a reframe too far )			0
read a bedtime story to your children as if it is the most exciting book in the world 25 january : rather than a @entity239 ’s resolution , set yourself a @entity241 ( @entity240 )			1
this is something that is massive and that inspires you , for instance , to write your novel , to run a marathon or to be the best mum in the world			0
26 january : be genuinely interested in other people - ask loads of questions about them			1
in a bizarre twist of quantum psychology , people will find you insanely interesting			0
27 january : remember children spell ‘ love ’ , ‘ t , i , @entity259 , e ’ ( * see point 23 )			1
28 january : make sure that you use more positive than negative language			1
the ratio needs to be about five positives for every negative , so catch people doing things well and tell them			0
29 january : notice the ‘ beautiful ordinary ’ - the small things that other people rush past			2
appreciate that happiness is in the moment so notice sunrises , raindrops , smiles , flowers and smiling children			2
30 january : when setbacks occur , rather than beating yourself up in your head , ask yourself , ‘ what will i do differently next time ? ’ 31 january : ask yourself , if there was a version of you sitting on a cloud , watching you go about your tasks today , what advice would the ‘ cloud you ’ give the ‘ earthly you ’ ? how would they say you should walk , talk , think and behave ? take that advice			2
at the end of the day , spend five minutes writing down three things that have gone well , and why			2
commit to doing some exercise			0
do n’t kill yourself , 20 minutes a day is fine			2
it might feel like a chore at the time but it releases all sorts of lovely chemicals which will infuse you with a @entity301 glow			0
listen ( and i mean really listen ) to people			0
tune in and show an interest watch out for the 90/10 principle			0
this states that 10 per cent of your happiness depends on things that happen to you while a whopping 90 per cent depends on how you react to these events			2
make a conscious choice to be positive			0
if you have small children practice what @entity316 author @entity315 calls ‘ gazing lovingly ’			0
this means downing tools at the end of the evening and standing at your children ’s bedroom door , watching them sleep			0
the modern world dictates that you only ever do this with your own kids and there is an age limit of ten			0
after that , the general rule is that you never go in your kids ’ bedrooms , just in case ) .			0
