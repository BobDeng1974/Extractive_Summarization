@entity0 modestly shrugged off his goalscoring feats after establishing himself as the top marksman in @entity4 qualifying history			1
the 34 - year - old @entity6 skipper helped himself to a hat - trick with a clinical display of finishing in saturday evening 's 7 - 0 demolition of @entity10 to take his tally in @entity13 qualifiers to 21 , one more than @entity15 's @entity14			1
in the process , he increased his record career total for @entity6 to 65 , just three fewer than @entity19 legend @entity18 and six behind @entity20 , who recently announced his retirement from international football			1
video : scroll down to see some audacious skill from @entity0 during a training session @entity0 celebrates at @entity26 as he completes his hat - trick against @entity10 but @entity0 , who famously rarely remembers details of the games in which he has played , later insisted personal milestones were not at the forefront of his mind			1
asked if he was aware of the company he is keeping , he said : ' i get messages from people telling me - my brother tells me all the time			2
' he texts me and my mates text me , but i genuinely could n't tell you who 's even close to me on it			2
i know @entity20 - that 's as far as i know			1
' honestly , i do n't really think about it			0
like i said , i get messages from people , but personally i do n't really think about it			0
' i never think about what 's happened before , i never think about what 's going to happen in the future because i ca n't predict what 's going to happen in the future			0
' the past is the past			0
i scored those goals , but i 'm so focused on what i 'm doing now that i 'm not really interested in anybody else , to be honest			0
' @entity0 leaves the pitch in @entity58 with the match ball after his three - goal feat @entity0 made his senior international debut as a 17 - year - old against the @entity63 in march 1998 , and scored for the first time in a green shirt against @entity66 in the october of the same year			1
former strike - partner @entity67 , whose then record of 21 goals he surpassed a decade ago to the day on monday , knew from those early days that the @entity70 had a real talent on their hands , but the @entity75 hitman 's record is little short of phenomenal			1
@entity0 , who has nevertheless attracted criticism for his performances at times in recent years , is the nation 's most - capped player with his latest hat - trick marking a 136th appearance , and he has insisted he will keep on turning up for as long as he is wanted and feels able to contribute			1
defender @entity83 has little doubt how important the @entity58 remains to his country			0
@entity83 said : ' people will obviously crib because they are desperate to knock @entity0 as soon as they can , but believe me he is an absolute legend , purely because of his goalscoring , his finishing			2
' he still has to put those chances away , in the right place at the right time			0
he 's a special , special player and still will be for years to come			0
' @entity6 defender @entity83 heaped praise on @entity6 's record goalscorer keane in the short term , the focus for both men is a trip to @entity99 and tuesday 's @entity101 qualifier against @entity102 , who slipped to a shock 2 - 0 defeat in @entity106 as @entity6 were making merry against @entity10			1
@entity0 said : ' it 's a tough game , completely different			2
obviously the opposition it 's going to be a tough test			0
' before this game [ @entity10 ] , our main aim was to get six points going into the @entity19 game and we 've done that , so we 're going into the @entity19 game with a lot of confidence			2
' make no mistake , we can go there and get something out of that game , there 's no question about that			0
