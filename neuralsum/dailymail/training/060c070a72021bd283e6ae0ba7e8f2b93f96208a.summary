@entity0 are hopeful that @entity2 ’s ankle injury will only keep him out for one game , which is good news for @entity4 but not for @entity5			1
@entity6 limped out of @entity0 ’s defeat at home to @entity9 on sunday and was forced to cancel plans to travel to @entity11 for the @entity13 awards ceremony where he had been nominated for @entity15			1
however , tests have revealed no serious damage and @entity6 is only expected to be ruled out of this weekend ’s game at @entity19			1
@entity2 ( left ) hobbled out of @entity0 's defeat at home to @entity9 on sunday @entity21 replaces @entity2 during the second half of the defeat to @entity9 at @entity24 the 31 - year - old should be available for the trip to @entity27 in the @entity28 a week on friday , although he was rested for @entity0 ’s game at @entity30 in the last round when @entity32 gave @entity33 an opportunity to impress			1
the news on @entity6 is less positive for @entity5 who is desperate for a run in the team to persuade @entity0 to make his loan move from @entity39 permanent in the summer			1
the @entity41 star was surprisingly axed from the 18 - man squad for the @entity9 match by @entity32 , casting further doubt over @entity0 ’s intentions to go ahead with a £ 52million deal			1
@entity5 is given a tough welcome to @entity47 by @entity49 defender @entity48 at @entity24 @entity5 has struggled to make an impact for @entity0 this season and would cost up to £ 52 million @entity5 is expected to regain his place against @entity19 in @entity6 ’s absence on saturday , but his return to the starting line - up may be shortlived			1
his agent @entity56 admitted earlier this week that he was unsure if the former @entity58 and @entity59 striker would stay at @entity24 beyond this season after starting only eight games so far			1
‘ i do n’t know ( if he will stay ) , ’ said @entity56			2
‘ he is a fantastic player and i think it ’s very difficult for @entity0 fans			2
they have an absolutely brilliant player , one of the very best in the world , who would without any doubt play 90 minutes , every time , with any other club			2
‘ the truth is , now , we do n’t know what will happen			2
what we do know is that he will play for one of the very best clubs in the world next season , whether that is @entity0 or not			2
i am 100 per cent sure of that			0
but you know how football works , we ’ll see what happens			0
’ @entity5 and @entity32 walk side - by - side following his arrival on - loan from @entity85 side @entity39 in the summer @entity32 dropped @entity86 striker @entity5 from the squad for the defeat against @entity9 on sunday one striker certain to be leaving @entity0 is @entity90 after the club agreed a transfer fee in the region of £ 1m with @entity94			1
@entity90 cost £ 4m when he moved to @entity24 in the summer of 2012 from @entity95 but never played a competitive game for @entity0 , scoring once in a pre-season friendly against @entity99 club @entity98 a year later			1
he went out on loan to @entity101 and @entity102 before making a season - long move to @entity104 where he has scored 10 goals so far this season			0
@entity94 coach @entity107 ( left ) confirms that a deal for @entity90 ( right ) has been agreed the deal included an option for the @entity112 side to sign @entity90 permanently in the summer , and coach @entity107 confirmed that terms have now been agreed			0
with so many star names in @entity32 ’s squad , @entity90 had already indicated that his future would probably lie away from @entity24			2
‘ we have bought him outright , ’ said @entity107			0
‘ taking @entity90 depends on us , not on @entity0			0
we took him with the right of first refusal , which stands at around € 1.5m , and we have already signed a contract with him for the summer			0
there is no longer any doubt – he is ours and the story is resolved			0
’ meanwhile , @entity124 of @entity125 have failed with a bid for @entity0 ’s @entity125 keeper @entity127			0
@entity127 is for sale after @entity129 signed , but the clubs can not agree a fee and the keeper would prefer to join a bigger team			0
