by @entity0 a catwalk model who wowed audiences before @entity3 revealed today how she was born a man and is about to undergo a sex swap			1
@entity6 , 32 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , grew up as a boy called @entity10 and was cruelly tormented by playground bullies			1
@entity6 came out as a gay male in her teens and began wearing women ’s clothing in her 20s before starting hormone replacement therapy two years ago			1
she had also been accepted for @entity26 funding for a sex change , a procedure which costs between £ 12,000 and £ 14,000 after embarking on the course of hormones , @entity6 saw her previously masculine body change shape			2
her figure became shapely and womanly , and her breasts grew to a size @entity34			0
@entity6 soon left her pub job to pursue a career on the catwalk			1
and this week her modelling dream came to fruition as she stepped out onto the catwalk in a designer dress as part of @entity43 , a fashion show held to challenge the lack of diversity in the industry			1
the final part of her transformation will happen on thursday when @entity6 goes under the knife to become a fully - fledged woman			1
the model was born as a boy called @entity10 , right , but started hormone replacement therapy two years ago @entity6 said : ' the fashion show was amazing			1
they say you have not really made it as a model until you walk along the catwalk in a sheer dress with your nipples showing - and here i was doing it in my first show			1
luckily thanks to the hormones i have quite a nice pair now			0
i did n’t have time to get nervous , i was just so excited			0
' @entity6 knew she was different from a very young age			2
while other boys were out playing , she wanted to dress up in her grandmother ’s dresses			0
' i did n't know what i was feeling but i knew i was n't the same as everyone else , ' she said			0
' i used to dress up in dresses and pretend i was @entity77 in the @entity78 - but i told everyone else i was pretending to be a wizard			0
' and i might not have ever been on the catwalk before now , but i had plenty practice strutting up and down my living room aged ten to @entity85 ’s @entity84			0
' final step : @entity6 said she ca n't wait to have the op to make her sex swap complete @entity6 came out as gay in her teens , but still did not feel ' right ' in herself			2
in her 20s , she began sneaking out in dresses and heels			0
but it took until she was 30 to pluck up the courage to find out about becoming a woman - which is when she started taking hormones			1
@entity6 , who is now brimming with confidence , said she was looking forward to taking the final step towards becoming a woman with her @entity26 - funded operation			1
' i ’m starting to get nervous , ' she said			0
' to me it is just something that i have to do			0
it is like having two horns on my head that i have to get rid of to become the person that i have always felt i was inside			0
' @entity6 was spotted by @entity111 - an alternative modelling organisation - after she uploaded shots to an online agency			2
it hosted its own show on september 6 at upmarket venue waterlily ahead of @entity3			2
