a man who was declared clinically dead for 40 minutes was brought back to life thanks to a machine which performed life - saving chest compressions			1
@entity4 , 39 , from @entity5 , in @entity6 , @entity7 , was pronounced dead at the @entity8 last june after he suffered a heart attack			1
but thanks to a revolutionary cardiac support machine , called the @entity12 , staff were able to revive him			1
life - saver : the @entity15 keeps blood and oxygen flowing to vital organs he told the @entity20 : ' i am so grateful , more than i could ever say '			1
the @entity12 , which is battery operated , is a portable heart and lung pump which keeps blood and oxygen flowing to vital organs			1
a patient 's head , shoulders and upper back lie against a board while a band , which carries out chest compressions , is strapped around the person 's entire rib cage			2
when the patient is strapped in and the start button is pressed , the band pulls tight around the chest and constricts the entire rib cage , rhythmically pumping the heart at a rate of 80 compressions per minute			0
@entity43 chest compressions , even when done well , only provide between 10 and 20 per cent of normal blood flow to the heart and 30 to 40 per cent to the brain			0
but this new pump moves more blood more consistently , according to experts			0
a patient 's head , shoulders and upper back lie against a board while a band , which carries out chest compressions , is strapped around the person 's entire rib cage the @entity20 reports that @entity4 is one of seven cardiac arrest patients in @entity7 who have been treated with the band			1
three have been revived from being declared clinically dead for 40 to 60 minutes , it said			2
@entity12 machines have been on the market since 2003 and are being used more and more around the world			1
@entity62 , the company which makes the device , said : ' victims receive more consistent , high - quality compressions than those delivered by simple automated cpr devices , which means improved blood flow			2
' the @entity70 said a recent study on the effectiveness of the machine showed that it had a ' promising ' future			2
twenty nine patients who took part in the study received more blood pressure than they would have with manual compressions			0
in 2010 , @entity79 , 53 , was found lying unconscious in @entity80 after suffering a cardiac arrest			0
doctors hooked him up to a @entity12 pump which maintained mr @entity79 's heartbeat for more than three hours while he was stablised by medics			1
at the time , @entity86 , lead consultant in @entity87 , who treated mr @entity79 said he had never seen such a remarkable case in his 15 years in @entity89 and emergency care			0
he said : ' even a fully - trained professional finds it hard to deliver consistent , high quality chest compressions when attempting to resuscitate someone whose heart has stopped beating			0
' @entity87 teams have a range of equipment available but the new device means we can carry on helping someone â€™s heart to beat for much longer improving blood flow to vital organs and increasing their chances of recovery			0

@entity4 was brought back to life by a device called the @entity12
the revolutionary machine is now being tested in @entity7
three patients have been revived using the *technique* since the trial began
