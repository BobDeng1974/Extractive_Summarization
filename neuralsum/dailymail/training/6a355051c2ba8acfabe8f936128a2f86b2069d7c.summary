@entity0 were able to adapt to high altitudes thanks to a gene picked up when their ancestors mated with a now extinct early species of human			1
it is the first time a gene from another species of human has been shown unequivocally to have helped modern humans adapt to their environment , researchers said			2
they found the gene came from @entity15 a human relative that became extinct 40,000 - 50,000 years ago , around the same time as the more well - known @entity17			1
@entity0 nomads play billiards on an open grassland near @entity21 : researchers have revealed the population evolved to thrive at high altitudes in just 3,000 years			1
the gene has been referred to as the ' superathlete ' gene because at low elevations , some variants of it help athletes quickly boost hemoglobin and thus the oxygen - carrying capacity of their blood , upping endurance			2
at high altitudes , however , the common variants of the gene boost hemoglobin and its carrier , red blood cells , too much , increasing the thickness of the blood and leading to hypertension and heart attacks as well as low birth weight babies and increased infant mortality			0
the variant , or allele , found in @entity0 raises hemoglobin and red blood cell levels only slightly at high elevations , avoiding the side effects seen in most people who relocate to elevations above 13,000 feet			2
the unusual variant of a gene involved in regulating the body ’s production of hemoglobin – the molecule that carries oxygen in the blood – became widespread in @entity0 after they moved onto the high - altitude plateau several thousand years ago			1
this variant allowed them to survive despite low oxygen levels at elevations of 15,000 feet or more , whereas most people develop thick blood at high altitudes , leading to cardiovascular problems			0
' we have very clear evidence that this version of the gene came from @entity15 , ' said principal author @entity74 , @entity75 professor of integrative biology			1
' this shows very clearly and directly that humans evolved and adapted to new environments by getting their genes from another species			0
' @entity74 and his colleagues at @entity85 in @entity86 , the world ’s largest genome sequencing center , published their research in @entity88			0
the gene , called @entity90 , is activated when oxygen levels in the blood drop , triggering production of more hemoglobin			0
' we found that part of the @entity90 gene in @entity0 is almost identical to the gene in @entity15 and very different from all other humans , ' @entity74 said			1
' we can do a statistical analysis to show that this must have come from @entity15			2
there is no other way of explaining the data			0
' @entity105 sketched out a possible scenario leading to this result : modern humans coming out of @entity109 interbred with @entity15 populations in @entity111 as they passed through that area into @entity86 , and their descendants still retain a small percentage – perhaps 0.1 percent – of @entity115			2
the tiny fragment of finger bone has enabled scientists to map out the entire genetic code of the @entity15 , a little - known ancient cousin of modern humans the group that invaded @entity86 eventually split , with one population moving into @entity123 and the other , now known as @entity124 , dominating the lower elevations			1
@entity74 and his colleagues are analyzing other genomes to pin down the time of @entity129 , which they said probably happened over a rather short period of time			0
' there might be many other species from which we also got @entity115 , but we do n’t know because we do n’t have the genomes , ' @entity74 said			0
' the only reason we can say that this bit of @entity115 is @entity15 is because of this lucky accident of sequencing dna from a little bone found in a cave in @entity142			2
' we found the @entity15 species at the dna level , but how many other species are out there that we have n’t sequenced ? ' @entity147 's highest peak , @entity148 , in the @entity149 , the @entity86			2
researchers have now revealed how the locals have adapted to the high altitudes adaptation to low oxygen levels has allowed many peoples , from @entity156 to @entity0 , to live at high altitude			0
when people from lower elevations move above about 13,000 feet , where oxygen levels are about 40 percent lower than at sea level , they typically tire easily , develop headaches , produce babies with lower birth weights and have a higher infant mortality rate			0
@entity0 have none of these problems , despite lower oxygen saturation in the blood and lower hemoglobin levels			0
@entity172 , which gives blood its red color , binds and transports oxygen to the body ’s tissues			0
previous research of the comparison of the genomes of 50 @entity0 and 40 @entity124 shows that ethnic @entity0 split off from the @entity124 less than 3,000 years ago and since then rapidly evolved a unique ability to thrive at high altitudes and low oxygen levels			1
the genome - wide comparison , performed by evolutionary biologists at the @entity75 , uncovered more than 30 genes with dna mutations that have become more prevalent in @entity0 than @entity124 , nearly half of which are related to how the body uses oxygen			1
one mutation in particular spread from fewer than 10 percent of the @entity124 to nearly 90 percent of all @entity0			1
the new findings could steer scientists to till - now unknown genes that play a role in how the body deals with decreased oxygen , and perhaps explain some diseases , including schizophrenia and epilepsy , associated with oxygen deprivation in the womb , he said			0
the widespread mutation in @entity0 is near a gene called @entity90 , a so - called ' super athlete gene ' identified several years ago and named because some variants of the gene are associated with improved athletic performance			1
researchers obtained dna from 50 @entity0 living in the @entity149 of @entity86 and 40 @entity124 from @entity212			1
the @entity0 lived in two villages located at elevations of 4,300 meters ( 14,100 feet ) and 4,600 meters ( 15,100 feet )			0
@entity86 researchers took blood samples from the participants and measured oxygen saturation , red blood cell concentration and hemoglobin content in their blood			0
the analysis revealed that the common ancestors of @entity0 and @entity124 split into two populations about 2,750 years ago , with the larger group moving to the @entity0 plateau			1
that group eventually shrank , while the low - elevation @entity124 population expanded dramatically			1
today , the @entity124 are the dominant ethnic group in mainland @entity86			1
the @entity0 branch either merged with the people ’s already occupying the @entity0 plateau , or replaced them .			0

mutation is *similar* to a ' super athlete ' gene *believed* to give improved athletic performance
@entity238 came from @entity15 , a human relative that became extinct 40,000 - 50,000 years ago
ethnic @entity0 split off from the @entity124 less than 3,000 years ago
