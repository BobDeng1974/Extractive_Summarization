the @entity0 bring many original characters and story lines back to @entity23 and @entity24 , but the shows have the edgier feel of a nighttime soap , according to @entity28			1
the premiere of @entity16 jumps five years ahead from the cliffhanger finale in 2011 where a shot was fired in a room full of people - then cuts to a hot dream sequence between @entity35 ( @entity36 ) and @entity37 ( @entity38 ) that would have definitely raised a few daytime broadcast censor 's eyebrows			1
daytime drama : one life to live returns today with an all - new online version that will feature many members of the original cast plus some new faces story update : the new online episodes of @entity16 will be 30 minutes rather than the usual 60 , and can be watched on @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 all @entity4 is the more traditional of the two shows , and even with no @entity55 there are a lot of familiar faces			1
@entity35 ( @entity36 ) is out of prison and still up to no good			2
@entity60 ( @entity59 and @entity61 ) are still madly in love - but disturbing details emerge involving their daughter @entity64			2
@entity65 ( @entity66 ) asks son @entity67 ( @entity67 ) to bring his @entity69 experience - and washboard abs - to help reverse the fortunes of the family business			0
@entity73 ( @entity74 ) asks @entity75 ( @entity76 ) to marry him			0
but does he have an ulterior motive ? funny moments : @entity35 steals the show when he shows up at the club for a disco dance sequence over in @entity24 , one life to live also brought back a lot of fan favorites including @entity85 ( @entity86 ) , @entity87 ( @entity88 ) @entity90 ( @entity89 ) , @entity92 ( @entity91 ) , and @entity93 ( @entity94 )			1
new characters include a bartender played by @entity97			2
@entity98 , who wrote the new theme song , is also slated to appear			0
the premiere had a darker feel with plenty of edge - of - your - seat moments - there was a murder before the opening credits and a hooded figure with a mysterious tattoo stalking bad boy @entity109			1
tea ( @entity111 ) is still mourning her her baby who died in @entity113 , but ignoring her teenage daughter @entity114 whose out - of - control partying leads to tragic consequences in one of the most shocking scenes			0
but there were also humorous moments : @entity35 ( @entity121 ) stole the show when he performed a @entity124 - style disco dream sequence outside the club			1
having everyone in town show congregate at the same spot has become as common a plot device as coming back from the dead , but this time it actually felt realistic			0
new twist : one life to live mixes younger characters like @entity135 ( far left ) and @entity136 ( near left ) with older generations of veterans like @entity140 ( near right ) and @entity109 ( far right ) the younger characters want to party , while the older ones have a financial stake in the club			2
