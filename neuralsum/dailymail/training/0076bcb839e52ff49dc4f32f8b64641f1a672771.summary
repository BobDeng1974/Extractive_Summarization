a massive study of the @entity2 floor shows it ’s a huge underwater garbage dump			1
on over 18,000 hours of footage from deep sea remotely operated vehicles , researchers at @entity7 ( @entity7 ) looked at seafloor as deep as 13,000 feet and found manmade trash items in every place they looked			1
deep sea vehicles viewed dive sites all along the @entity13 from the @entity14 to @entity15 and all around the @entity16 , with the worst accumulation of plastic , metal , fishing debris , and other trash in @entity22 off the @entity24 coast			1
in the deep sea ravine off the coast of @entity24 alone , the researchers noted over 1,150 pieces of debris on the seafloor			1
everywhere : a rockfish in a shoe			1
the study took place over the course of 22 years and found trash everywhere they looked on the sea floor along the @entity13 and around the @entity16 mapped : everywhere the along the @entity13 and @entity16 the seafloor is littered with plastic , metal , and various other man - made trash @entity54 : the researchers were surprised to find that the deeper they went , the more trash they found			1
even as deep down as 13,000 feet researchers did not find random spatterings of trash all across the @entity2 seafloor			1
instead , they discovered that debris accumulates in deep sea slopes and rocky areas			1
there was more garbage found in deeper areas than in more shallower spots			1
trash canyon : a tire rests 2,850 feet down in @entity22 , the most trash - filled spot the study found not so refreshing : a @entity72 bottle keeps company with tiny starfish slimy deep : researchers found more trash the deeper they dove , especially in rocky , sloping areas ‘ i was surprised that we saw so much trash in deeper water			1
we do n't usually think of our daily activities as affecting life two miles deep in the ocean			1
’ said lead author of the study @entity87			1
‘ i 'm sure that there 's a lot more debris in the canyon that we 're not seeing			1
a lot of it gets buried by underwater landslides and sediment movement			1
some of it may also be carried into deeper water , farther down the canyon			1
’ most of the debris , about a third of it , is plastic			1
because there is no sunlight on the sea floor , these petroleum - based objects can take hundreds of years to degrade			2
and as they do , they often turn brittle and break into tiny pieces			2
as this happens , it becomes more likely that tiny sea floor creatures will consume the toxic substances			2
this can harm the animal and introduce foreign substances into the food chain			2

more trash was found in this deep sea ravine than anywhere else deep sea fishing : fishing gear was also a common			2
plastic was the most common type of object found paper or plastic : @entity135 was the second most common item type found			2
of the plastic items , about half were plastic grocery bags of the plastic items , about half were plastic grocery bags			2
these increasingly controversial items can choke and smother animals			2
@entity145 became the biggest city in the country to ban free plastic bags in grocery stores following a city council vote this past tuesday			0
about $ 2 million a year is spent to clean up plastic bag litter in @entity145			0
sanitation authorities estimate more than 228,000 bags are distributed in the city every hour			0
but clearly many of the bags are ending up deep down on the sea floor			0
metal objects were the second most common			0
of them , about two thirds were aluminum , steel , or tin cans			0
discarded fishing equipment was also commonly observed			0
as were glass bottles , papers , and cloth			0
@entity165 : a huge shipping container containing a thousand tires was found			0
researchers believe such large items could seriously disrupt deep sea ecosystems batteries included : in addition to choking and suffocating creatures , some trash can contaminate the deep sea with caustic chemicals @entity7 researchers hope to do additional research to understand the long - term biological impacts of trash in the deep sea			0
working with the @entity182 , they are currently finishing up a detailed study of the effects of a particularly large piece of marine debris — a shipping container that fell off a ship in 2004			0
inside the container are over 1,000 steel - belted tires			0
researchers believe such a large item , to which many organisms have attached despite being in a habitat devoid of solid objects , can seriously disrupt a deep sea ecosystem			0

plastic and metal , in the absence of llight , heat , and bacteria can take many years to @entity211 cast off bag of potato chips there is no way to cost - effectively remove the trash , so education about preventing further accumulation is a major goal of the project			0
for now , though — or at least up until now — the problem has only worsened			0
‘ the most frustrating thing for me is that most of the material we saw — glass , metal , paper , plastic — could be recycled , ’ said @entity87			0
‘ ultimately , preventing the introduction of litter into the marine environment through increased public awareness remains the most efficient and cost - effective solution to this dilemma			0

seafloor along the west coast and all around the @entity16 is covered in refuse
