dr @entity1 ’s tricorder could soon be ‘ fact , not science fiction ’ , allowing people all over the world diagnose their own illnesses			2
this is according to a group of engineers who have set up a £ 6 million ( $ 10 million ) competition to develop a real - life version of the @entity13 gadget			1
the @entity14 , launched last year , hopes to inspire a wireless device capable of detecting a range of diseases , including anaemia , tuberculosis and diabetes			1
pictured is @entity26 device , one of the ten finalists now ten finalists have been chosen from a diverse range of backgrounds including a team backed by @entity33 and the @entity34 , and others who come from university departments			1
according to the rules , finalists must demonstrate their devices on humans next year and three winners will be announced in 2016 , with a top prize of £ 4.3 million ( $ 7 million )			1
to win the cash prize , the device has to monitor vital signs as well as diagnose 16 different conditions			1
one of the finalists , the @entity49 - based group @entity48 , revealed a handheld scanner at the @entity52 conference earlier year			1
@entity53 are the youngest team competing for the @entity54			1
@entity56 's solution is a monitoring device designed to gather five different vital signs at once , to be worn around the neck on the left is @entity63 , and the right shows the @entity66 device , both of which can monitor vital signs a tricorder is a scanning device used by @entity71 personnel in the @entity13 universe			1
there are two variations ; a regular ( engineering ) tricorder , pictured here being used by @entity1 , played by @entity77 another device , called the @entity48 , pictured , works in a similar way to the @entity13 tricorder			1
it is held on a person 's temple for 10 seconds			0
built - in sensors then establish body temperature and heart rate a tricorder is a scanning device used by @entity71 personnel in the @entity13 universe			1
there are two variations ; a regular ( engineering ) tricorder and a medical tricorder			0
medical tricorders are used to wirelessly scan a patient , either in a ‘ sick bay ’ on a star ship or during an away mission			0
the scanning tool can determine a patient ’s medical status , and allows doctors to quickly and easily diagnose their condition without an intensive or invasion examination			0
the technology was developed by @entity106 's chief executive @entity105 , 56 , at @entity33 ’s @entity107 in @entity108			1
it contains a variety of different sensors , alongside a microphone on the top of the gadget , that can read five vital signs			1
these include body temperature , heart rate , oximetry ( blood oxygen levels ) , heart rate variability and pulse wave transit time ( @entity123 ) - the time it takes for a heartbeat to reach somewhere else in a person ’s body			1
@entity123 is related to blood pressure			0
its makers claim the device is 99 per cent accurate in less than 10 seconds			2
@entity131 tricorder is shown on the left while the @entity133 is on the right			0
it uses computer - vision techniques to analyse images taken with a camera			0
the @entity131 tricorder is a that features a 3 - lead electrode to measure @entity141 signals from the finger , an infrared temperature sensor , camera and accelerometer the portable electronic device , pictured , contains a variety of sensors , plus a microphone on the top of the gadget , that can read five vital signs			1
these include body temperature , heart rate , oximetry ( blood oxygen levels ) , ecg waves , heart rate variability and pulse wave transit time ( @entity123 ) @entity162 's wristband continuously monitors patient activity and vital signs , while modules called ' shield , ' ' to see , ' ' to hear , ' and ' pee ' provide additional information used to make diagnoses @entity170 featured in the @entity171 2014			2
doctors and medical engineers point out that much of the technology is already proven available to use separately this information is then stored on a smartphone app that patients can use to monitor their health , or can be shared with doctors			0
the tricorder uses a @entity181 adapter that can be hooked into a usb port , and it takes less than an hour to charge the battery			0
a tricorder prop from @entity186 , a @entity13 film			0
now researchers are creating real - life versions when it is being used a few times every day , the battery lasts for about a week , the firm says			0
another device by @entity193 - based , @entity191 , uses computer - vision techniques to analyse images taken with a camera			2
they hope their system will make observations of the inside of the ears or throat , say – in the same way a doctor would – and then feed it into a computer for analysis			0
other teams are using blood and urine samples to test for key markers			0
the tiny microfluidic devices will , they claim , work in a similar way to hospital - lab tests			2
@entity217 , for instance , has teamed teamed up with @entity33 to create a device that astronauts could use to monitor their health on long trips and in zero gravity			1
doctors and medical engineers point out that much of the technology is already proven available to use separately			0
for instance , light sensors can now track blow flow and oxygen levels within the human body			0
other sensors can be used to detect gases in breath that may indicate certain diseases			1
a real - life tricorder may not be as far away as people think			0
the challenge , now , will be to bring all of these elements together into one device			2
@entity170 has been developed by a team in @entity241 , @entity242			2
it can provide real - time monitoring of heart rate , respiration rate and motion other teams are using blood and urine samples to test for key markers			0
the tiny microfluidic devices will , they claim , work in a similar way to hospital - lab tests			2

contest hopes to inspire a wireless device that can detect 16 diseases
these include anaemia , tuberculosis , stroke , sleep apnea and diabetes
finalists include a team backed by @entity33 and the @entity34
they will have to demonstrate prototype devices on humans next year
three winners will be announced in 2016 with a top prize of £ 4.3 million
