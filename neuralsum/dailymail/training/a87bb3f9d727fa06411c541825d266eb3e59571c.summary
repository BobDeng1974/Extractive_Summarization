by @entity0 published : 06:37 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 12:36 est , 14 november 2012 a ‘ homeless planet ’ which floats through space without orbiting a star had been discovered for the first time			1
scientists have speculated on the existence of such a planet and have been trawling the night skies for more than a decade , although the hunt was described as looking for a ‘ needle in a thousand haystacks ’			1
the isolated planet , which astronomers believe may have been flung away during its formation , is not tied by gravity to a star and in 100 light years away			1
an artist 's impression shows the free - floating planet @entity20 , the ' loneliest planet ' without a star			1
the planet is called @entity24 and appears to be part of a group of very young stars known as the @entity28			1
it is 100 light years away from our solar system @entity33 ( @entity33 ) researchers working with @entity35 colleagues and data provided by the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) and the @entity38 ’s @entity39 ( @entity39 ) came across the huge discovery			2
@entity42 , an astrophysicist at @entity33 , said : ' although theorists had established the existence of this type of very cold and young planet , one had never been observed until today			2
' the absence of a shining star in the area around this planet enabled the team to study its atmosphere in great detail			1
this information will in turn enable astronomers to better understand planets that do orbit stars			0
' over the past few years , several objects of this type have been identified , but their existence could not be established without scientific confirmation of their age , ' said @entity65 , a doctoral student of physics at @entity33			2
' astronomers were n’t sure whether to categorise them as planets or as @entity69			0
' brown dwarfs are what we could call failed stars , as they never manage to initiate nuclear reactions in their centres			0
' this closeup of an image captured by the @entity78 shows the free - floating planet @entity80 in infrared light			2
the planet is called @entity24 and appears to be part of a group of very young stars known as the @entity28			0
it is between 50 and 120 million years old , with a temperature of approximately 400 degrees celsius , and weighs four to seven times that of @entity91			1
the study ’s findings support theories that suggest these kinds of isolated objects are more common than currently believed			0
astrophysicist ms @entity42 , who also worked on the study , said : ' this object was discovered during a scan that covered the equivalent of 1,000 times the surface of the full moon			0
' we observed hundreds of millions of stars and planets , but we only found one homeless planet in our neighbourhood			1
' now we will be looking for them amongst an astronomical number of sources further afield			0
' it ’s like looking for a single needle in amongst thousands of haystacks			0
' @entity38 's @entity39 ( @entity39 ) at @entity114 in @entity115 , where many of the measurements were made			0

planet is first to be found not tied by gravity to a star
believed to be between 50 and 120 million years old , with a temperature of approximately 400 degrees celsius , and weighing four to seven times that of @entity91
