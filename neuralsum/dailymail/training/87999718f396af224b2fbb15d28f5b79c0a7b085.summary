hearings : @entity10 and @entity22 were sentenced at the @entity34 ( pictured ) in central @entity12 for conduct likely to interfere with the administration of justice the defendants in the original trial , @entity79 and @entity80 , faced a retrial and were convicted in march			1

@entity22 told the court he had no intention to cause disruption to the trial process , or to investigate the case online			2
he said he only wanted to find out how long the trial would take as he was worried that it would drag on , affecting his job and his family life			0
last week , @entity10 appeared before sir @entity91 , president of the @entity93 , and mr @entity94 at @entity12 's @entity34 as the attorney general appeared in person to call for his committal to prison			1
sir @entity91 announced in the case of @entity10 that the court was sure he ‘ did an act which created a real risk of interference with the administration of justice , and it was specifically intended by him to interfere with the administration of justice ’			2
the court had reached the same conclusion in the case of @entity22			2
in a postscript to the judgment , sir @entity91 said that ‘ every attempt is made to try and warn jurors not to use the internet or social sites for any purpose in relation to the case ’			2
he added : ‘ however , as is also clear , the language used is not consistent , giving room for argument of the type advanced before us as to what a juror might understand was prohibited			0
’ trial : a judge at @entity47 ( pictured ) was alerted to @entity10 's post and he was discharged last december from the retrial of @entity49 , who was later convicted of sexual activity with a child sir @entity91 said : ‘ many judges have adopted the practice not only of warning the jury in terms similar to what the judges in these two cases did , but also handing the jury a notice setting out what they must and must not do , and the penal consequences of any breach			0
‘ they have done this so that no juror can subsequently claim that he or she did not understand what they should not do and what the consequences might be			0
’ sir @entity91 said that after @entity10 was discharged as a juror , the judge told the jury ‘ in very sweeping terms that they should not use the internet ’			1
' @entity42 , i was n't expecting to be in a jury deciding a paedophile 's fate - i 've always wanted to f * * * up a paedophile and now i 'm within the law ! ' @entity10 he added : ‘ we can quite understand why he did this , but as lord @entity169 ( for @entity10 ) pointed out , what he said went beyond what would be permissible under @entity172 and 10 , quite apart from imposing restrictions on jurors properly carrying out day to day tasks which can not be easily done without use of the internet			2
’ the judge said the court proposed to invite the @entity180 in consultation with the @entity182 to ‘ review the terminology used in the material given to the jury ’ and to consider whether to recommend that the practice of handing out a notice as well as the warning ‘ should be universally followed ’			0
after both men were sentenced to two months ’ imprisonment , the attorney general said : ‘ jurors who use the internet to research a case undermine justice			1
‘ it creates a risk that the defendant will be convicted or acquitted , not on the evidence , but on unchallenged and untested material discovered by the juror			0
‘ equally , the case of @entity10 shows that jurors must follow the directions given to them by the trial judge not to discuss the case outside the jury room , including discussions and posts on the internet			1

@entity10 , 21 , of @entity12 said there was ' lots of @entity211 news at the time '
