forgiven : in this image taken from the @entity16 footage of the robbery , mr @entity12 can be seen defending himself against armed robber @entity18 the armed robber went on to say that a ‘ hardworking taxpayer ’ deserves to be able to make a ‘ decent living ’ without the crook ‘ taking what is yours ’			1

he struck at his newsagent in @entity29 , @entity30 , as mr @entity12 was about to shut up shop for the night in february			1

at that point robber wrenched the entire till off its base and fled down the street , where he had stashed his coat under a parked car			2
mr @entity12 ’s 78 - year - old mother was in the back of the shop and ‘ had the shock of her life ’ when she came to see what all the commotion was about			1

‘ i apologise for any distress i caused your mother or yourself and for any further damaged caused			2
i genuinely had no intention to harm you in any way , but that is still no excuse for my action or for any fear i may have caused			0
‘ my mother works in @entity122 and i could only imagine how angry i would be if somebody did that to her			0
