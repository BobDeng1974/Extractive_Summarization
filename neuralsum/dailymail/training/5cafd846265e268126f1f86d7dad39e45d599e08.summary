it then emerged there was an underground tunnel easily accessible from the basement , connecting the other condos in the block and leading outside the building			0
the tunnel ’s outside door is usually locked and only accessible to maintenance men , but crucially , it was left open during the time he was in the resident because residents were getting rid of a build - up of trash in a dumpster left outside			0
