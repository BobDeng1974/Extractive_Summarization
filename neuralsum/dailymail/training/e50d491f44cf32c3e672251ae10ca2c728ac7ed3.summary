not so rich : vice president @entity44 's wealth , along with his wife @entity49 , definitely does n't top $ 1 million , but he took advantage of low - interest mortgage rates in 2013 to refinance his home unlike the @entity39 , @entity44 has taken advantage of lower mortgage rates and refinanced his mortgage last year			1

the president 's three books brought in between $ 70,000 and $ 165,000 in royalties in 2013
two years earlier , however , the books sold more *briskly* , *earning* him between $ 250,000 and $ 2.1 million
*vp* @entity44 refinanced his mortgage last year , *snagging* an *impressive* 3.375 per cent interest rate
he and his wife @entity49 are worth between $ 276,000 and $ 940,000
financial disclosure forms for federal *employees* use wide ranges of values , making an official 's exact net work *impossible* to figure out
