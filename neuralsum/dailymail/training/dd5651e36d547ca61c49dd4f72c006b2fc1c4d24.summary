mugs depicting deputy prime minister and leader of the @entity1 @entity5 with the words ' i 'm sorry ' on at the @entity34 in @entity10 opposition to @entity5 's tuition fees apology were concerned the video would remind @entity1 supporters of the party 's broken promise , just as it had subsided in their memories			1
however , the popularity of the catchy ' @entity44 remix ' has resulted in the sort of sort of publicity that money simply can not buy			0
seizing upon its popularity , the party has wasted no time in creating memorabilia to build on the song 's success			0
