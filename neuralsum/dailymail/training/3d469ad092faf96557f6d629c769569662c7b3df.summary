by @entity0 in @entity1 , @entity2 published : 18:42 est , 5 september 2012 updated : 03:51 est , 6 september 2012 @entity4 convention delegates booed after the party voted to reinstate to its platform mentions of @entity7 and a declaration that @entity9 was is the capital of @entity12 in their platform			1
many in the arena jeered after the convention chairman mayor @entity17 , of @entity18 ruled that the amendments had been approved even though a large group of delegates had objected			0
the party reinstated language from the 2008 platform that said ' we need a government that stands up for the hopes , values and interests of working people and gives everyone willing to work hard the chance to make the most of their @entity7 - given potential '			1
but @entity45 charged that @entity42 had authorised the changes in the first place and reversed himself only after a wave of public criticism			2
the chaos in the arena was highly embarrassing for @entity4 and the vote to change the platform appeared to be indecisive but was railroaded through by @entity17 anyway			0
the fiasco exposed tensions on @entity12 within the party in a year when @entity58 support could be crucial , especially in the swing state of @entity60			2
‘ there was no discussion , ’ said @entity61 , a @entity62 delegate from @entity63 , who questioned whether the convention had enough of a quorum to even amend the platform			2
‘ we did n’t even see it coming			0
we were blindsided by it			0
’ @entity73 , a delegate from @entity74 , @entity75 , said : ‘ the majority spoke last night , " said			0
" we should n't be declaring @entity9 as the capital of @entity12			1
’ opposition : the @entity80 - @entity79 @entity4 on the floor objected to both the ' @entity7 ' language and the declaration that @entity9 is the capital of @entity12 republicans pounced quickly on both omissions			1
@entity45 officials argued that not taking a position on @entity9 's status in the party platform showed the president was weak in his support of @entity12			1
@entity45 presidential nominee @entity92 said omitting @entity7 ' suggests a party that is increasingly out of touch with the mainstream of the @entity79 people			1
' ' i think this party is veering further and further away into an extreme wing that @entity79 's do n't recognize , ' @entity92 said			0
confusion : @entity101 was unsure what to do when the amendment did n't have a clear two - thirds majority in the first two voice votes the @entity4 's decision to restore the mention of @entity9 reflected what advisers claim was the president 's personal view , if not the policy of his administration			2
the administration has long said determining @entity9 's status was an issue that should be decided by @entity12 and @entity117 in peace talks , but has been careful not to state that @entity9 is @entity12 's capital			1
@entity92 's campaign quickly sought to capitalize on the slight , but important difference			0
' @entity92 has consistently stated his belief that @entity9 is the capital of @entity12 , ' said @entity123 , @entity92 's spokeswoman			1
' president @entity42 has repeatedly refused to say the same himself			0
now is the time for president @entity42 to state in unequivocal terms whether or not he believes @entity9 is @entity12 's capital			1
' the @entity127 would n't say whether the change in the @entity4 platform language reflected a change in administration policy			0
fixed ? this is the language to was put back into the @entity133 after it was removed on tuesday @entity135 chairwoman @entity134 said the reinstated party language reflected ' the policy of both @entity45 and @entity4 administrations for decades			2
' following the decision , former @entity140 gov @entity139 told reporters , ' it was an effort to bring clarification			0
' but the decision to amend the platform did not rest well with some delegates			0
republicans declared @entity9 the capital of @entity12 in the platform the party approved last week at its convention in @entity152 , @entity60 .			1
