for all his many talents - raw pace , an explosive strike and a strut of arrogance - @entity6 ’s strike - force requires greater replenishing than merely the return of @entity10 next season			1
@entity10 appears to be a fine young player , perhaps only usurped by the magnificent @entity12 among the younger players at this @entity14 so far			0
he will prove a valuable addition to the @entity6 squad , now that the work permit issues which forced the club to loan him out to @entity20 and @entity21 in the last two years have been resolved			1
his rapid flourishes will push the opposition back , force defenders to think differently			0
no longer should they have to rely solely on @entity39 , as was the case for so much of last season			0
@entity10 , too , seems the kind of hard - working , ball - playing footballer that will respond to the paternal qualities of @entity6 ’s manager , @entity23 , and he will be encouraged by the @entity48 ’s confirmation that he will be part of the squad for pre-season			1
against @entity26 , @entity10 demonstrated his qualities once more , nipping in before defenders @entity53 and @entity55 , mithering @entity28 with his direct running and providing the locals in @entity58 with an ‘ @entity59 ! ’ treat after one classy back - flick			1
in a game that was played out at the tempo of a warm - weather pre-season training camp , there were very few at all out there that flirted , even fleetingly , with inspiration			0
to his credit , for the sixty - sixty minutes @entity10 played , he did as much as any other player to break the stranglehold of tepid mediocrity that enveloped this match , darting in behind at every opportunity , shooting from distance when the opportunity presented itself			2
high flyer : @entity10 controls the ball in the air and looks set to be given a chance by @entity23 after that , he was rested for the knockout stages , offering a stark reminder of @entity26 ’s demise as a forward with nine goals in the @entity89 league last season is conserved for grander occasions			1
this is not to belittle @entity10 , who was irresistible against both @entity92 and @entity93			0
certainly , he can make an impact for @entity6 next season			0
but can he transform @entity23 ’s side from also - rans to title winners ? that much would seem to be the stuff of fantasy and @entity6 fans must dearly hope that @entity23 has greater ambitions in this transfer window			2
@entity6 must buy a forward of elite - standing , a game - changer , somebody that will strike fear , rather than comfort , into the defences of the continent ’s finest outfits			1
@entity10 , who has scored just eleven club goals in the last two seasons , is evidently not that man			2
@entity6 fans need a @entity116 , not a chap they ’ve only seen on the telly			0
in this @entity29 team , @entity10 is the go - to player , the one that is worshipped			1
in this perfectly - oiled , intensely drilled side , @entity10 ’s ability is blended with adrenalin and a fervent national pride			2
when he returns to @entity6 , he will be an understudy with a point to prove			0
time will tell whether he can elevate his performances on a consistent basis , but @entity23 must know better than to demand too much , too soon			0
star : @entity10 has been tipped as player of the tournament so far by @entity55 's manager @entity133 new acquaintance : @entity10 could end up playing alongside @entity53 - who has been linked with @entity6			1

@entity10 and his @entity29 team - mates draw 0 - 0 with @entity26
@entity6 - owned forward is returning to his parent club this *summer*
@entity10 nipped in ahead of @entity26 's back four *numerous* times
but with @entity29 he is the superstar - with @entity6 he wo *n't* be
