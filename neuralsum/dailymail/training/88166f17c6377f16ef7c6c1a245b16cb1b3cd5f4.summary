by @entity0 published : 06:41 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 15:47 est , 3 september 2013 seeing a shark swimming nearby can be a little unnerving			1
so imagine the shock of a walker who saw one as he strolled by a river ten miles from the sea			0
@entity8 , 27 , filmed the 5ft - long shark on his mobile phone as it circled in shallow water at the weekend			1
thought to be a harmless smooth - hound shark , it probably swam up the @entity15 from mouth of the estuary , where they are commonly found , before becoming trapped behind a sluice gate after the tide went out			1
he said : ' we walked past and saw a big fin sticking up out of the water and thought " that must be a big fish "			1
' that thought quickly became " that 's a massive fish " and then i realised it was a shark			1
i really could not believe what i was seeing			0
' we have walked along there so many times before but never had i seen anything like that before			0
' it is believed to be a @entity51 , which is more commonly found in coastal waters around the country			1
proof : @entity8 ( left ) said he wanted to make sure he filmed the shark ( right ) because he feared his friends would not believe he had seen it coast : according to the @entity59 there are 35 species of shark that can be found around the coastal waters of @entity63 mr @entity8 , of @entity64 , @entity27 , spent more than an hour with his college lecturer father , 53 , watching the shark on sunday			1
there are more than 30 species of sharks which regulary inhabit the coasts of @entity63			0
according to @entity71 , at least 21 of these can be found on the @entity63 coastline all year round			0
among those that can be spotted throughout the year are the @entity75 and the @entity76			2
there have also been sightings of a range of other sharks , including just last week when a pack of killer blue sharks were seen off the coast of @entity84			0
while the species is normally confined to the mid-atlantic , diver @entity85 spotted the pack just five miles from the coast			2
meanhwile , @entity90 has today also reported on fisherman @entity91 who battled for two hours to reel in one of the biggest sharks ever caught in @entity63 waters			0
mr @entity91 , along with fellow angler @entity95 , caught the 14ft thresher shark about a mile south of @entity98 on the @entity99			1
he has given a ' conservative ' estimate that the shark was at least 4ft long but thinks it could have been as long as 5ft			2
he added : ' it was an amazing sight to see and i knew i had to film it , otherwise my friends would not have believed a word i was saying			2
' the water was quite shallow where we saw it and its fin was sticking out of the water - it was like a scene from @entity116			1
' you do get people fishing here and there is a beach further up the river but it 's surprising to find a shark			2
' mr @entity8 informed the @entity125 and the @entity126 of his sighting			1
he said : ' we got really close to it and could see it was as long as some metal railings in the water so we had a good gauge to work out how big it was			0
' i really was shocked and amazed - i did not for one minute expect to see something like that in the river			0
' it was just fascinating watching it swimming around			0
' @entity140 , commodore from the nearby @entity141 , said : ' we have had sharks in the lowest point of the river before but not up where it was seen			0
' according to the @entity59 there are 35 species of shark that can be found around the coastal waters of @entity63			0
quite a way : the shark was spotted 10 miles inland up the @entity15			1

@entity8 spotted the shark while walking by the @entity15
mr @entity8 and his father @entity154 spotted a fin sticking out of the water
the creature is believed to be a @entity51
