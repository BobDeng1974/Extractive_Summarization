two marksmen fired 22 rounds in a ' crazy ' , frenetic and adrenaline - filled moment as police stormed the @entity4 and shot gunman man @entity5 to end the @entity7 siege			1
entry officers initially felt a sense of pride after a hail of gunfire and stun grenades in the early hours of december 16 brought the @entity15 stand - off to a tense climax			1
but the role of the two key , unnamed marksmen who led the operation has been called into question as details emerged at an inquest on thursday that fragments of ricocheted police bullets struck and killed mother - of - three @entity25			2
the findings were announced at @entity27 in @entity7 's inner - west , and revealed that the 38 - year - old barrister died from blood loss after the deflected police rounds struck her carotid artery			2
@entity5 was shot 13 times , twice in the head , while it also emerged that he forced cafe manager @entity35 , 34 , to kneel before he shot him execution - style in the back of the head			1
@entity41 adrenalin , crazy moments and fear : what the entry team marksmen felt when they were tasked with the job of storming the @entity48 cafe to take down gunman man @entity49 recriminations : even before the inquest into the deaths of 38 - year - old @entity7 barrister @entity25 ( left ) and @entity35 ( right ) began , there has been many questions over the role of police and whether they could have saved the two victims lives if they had acted differently heart stopping moment : a former special operations officer says at the moment when the marksmen stormed the @entity4 ' every single one of the entry team that went into that cafe faced the possibility that this would be the last job of their life , @entity5 could have blown the place to smithereens to be known at the inquest into the @entity7 siege just as ' officer a ' and ' officer b ' , the two leading shooters tasked with bringing down the crazed @entity5 have been granted protection of their identity - for now			1
@entity76 has learned their ' proud ' work in striking @entity5 twice in the head and killing him , and then shooting a further 20 rounds from semi automatic rifles into the ' crazy ' scene of the siege 's end has drawn criticism from law enforcement officers and others			1
and now the counsel assisting the inquest into the siege , @entity87 , has told the hearing 's opening day that intense speculation about the rights or wrongs of the decisions made by the police marksmen and special operations commanders had been ' unhelpful '			1
apart from holding people up with a gun , he claimed ( falsely as it turns out ) to have bombs in his control ' questions concerning the use of police marksmen , whether to wait or to act immediately and other options have been discussed in public , ' he said			1
' all of us will have tried to imagine what it would be like to be caught up as these hostages so innocently were			0
' all of us will have wondered how we would have reacted had we been trapped in the siege and faced the events of those 17 hours			0
' only armchair hostages have a confident answer to how they would have reacted and it is no part of the business of this inquest to form moral judgments about such matters or to engage in philosophical hypotheticals			0
did he act alone ? man @entity5 ( pictured behind the @entity48 cafe window soon after taking command of the cafe on the morning of december 15 ) may not have been a lone wolf and the coroner will examine if anyone else was involved in planning his deadly attack videos and audio recoridngs , possibly taken by hostages , will reveal what happened inside the siege during the 17 hours , as well as how hostages ( inclkuding @entity157 , pictured , left ) escaped and why others remained inside until the violent end around 2am on day two ' if there were defects in the management of the siege they will be exposed			1
' @entity165 police and law enforcement specialists are divided over whether the number of bullets shot was adequate or ' overkill ' , and whether @entity25 might have survived if the incident had been approached differently			2
mr @entity170 revealed on thursday at @entity27 the story of the siege 's end as told by the stark details of the ballistics			2
man @entity5 fired five rounds from his sawn - off shot gun , three before the cafe was stormed including the cartridge he emptied into the head of the kneeling @entity35 while @entity5 fired from 75cm away			1
fragments : fragments or ricochets from police bullets injured one police officer and three hostages , including @entity188 who was carried ( pictured ) from the siege with a foot wound @entity5 , who was later found to have 21 shotgun cartridges in his pockets , would fire two more rounds from his weapon at entering police before he , too , was killed , as the entry team shot into the cafe 's glass doors and windows , shattering them , and then burst in , throwing into the entrance 11 ' flash bang ' @entity204 stun grenades which erupted into 99 small loud explosions			1
officer a and officer b then began firing			0
@entity5 was killed instantly by one of the two shots to his head and his body was peppered with a further 11 rounds			2
he had two rounds in his shotgun magazine and had been trying to reload when he was shot			2
six fragments or ricochets from officer a and officer b 's shots into the confines of the @entity48 cafe hit @entity25 , one causing her to bleed to death			1
@entity222 to smithereens : the threat by @entity5 that he had ' radio = controlled ' bombs in three places and wore a supposedly loaded backpack into the @entity48 cafe menat that explosive experts ( pictured , above ) and the police netry team could not know it was all a hoax fragments or ricochets also hit three other hostages and one of the tactical response unit officers was struck in the face			1
as the emotions of the tragedy receded in the days and weeks following the siege , recriminations and blaming between police hierarchy , the office of the @entity238 , magistrates and others has clouded discussions , @entity76 has been told			0
@entity76 has spoken with current police officers and former siege and operations specialists who say police opinion is divided over whether the siege could have been handled better or differently , either by siege supervisors or by @entity255 commandos based at @entity256 in western @entity7			2
fatal wound : the inquest into the @entity7 siege has revealed barrister @entity25 ( pictured , on the order of service for her funeral ) was tragically hit by six bullet fragments , one of which hit a major artery , causing her death should troops have been called in ? the inquest should settle whether troops such as the elite trained @entity272 should have been called in to forgo a bloody end for hostages ( pictured ) shot after the 16 hour siege ' but you have to remember that every single one of the entry team that went into that cafe faced the possibility that this would be the last job of their life , ' a former special operations officer said			1
' the terrorist could have had a bomb and could have blown the place to smithereens			0
the entry team had to be prepared to handle every single possibility , and preserve as many lives as possible			0
' mr @entity170 told the inquest of thursday that the management of the siege was among many important issues would be investigated and laid bare during the inquest proper , which is not expected to begin until at least the middle of the year			0
many witness : hostages and police involved in the @entity15 siege will pack a courtroom for the inquest into the bloody incidentwhich will be hear later this yesar in a packed couttoom public risk : security issues concerning @entity307 including if he being monitored willbe addressed along with issues as to how to protect the community and not end as the @entity7 siege did with flowers laid for the dead ( pictured ) in @entity15 , @entity7 they include : 1			1
security issues concerning mr @entity5 include the information held by @entity165 and @entity317 government agencies concerning mr @entity5 as a public security risk			0
for example was he being monitored at all , and if so , what emerged from any such surveillance ? 2			0
was this an act of terrorism ? mr @entity5 claimed in the café that his actions were an attack on @entity115 by @entity116			0
apart from holding people up with a gun , he claimed ( falsely as it turns out ) to have bombs in his control			0
at present it seems he had not established any contact with @entity116 before the siege though someone claiming to be from @entity116 adopted mr @entity5 ’ actions and his siege after his death			0
what terrorist associations , if any , did he have ? 3			0
did prosecuting authorities respond adequately to both the application , the applications for bail and its grant , for the charges he was facing at the time of the siege ? 4			0
were there mental health issues for mr @entity5 and what role did they play in his actions and behaviour ? 5			0
how was the siege managed in any way and in every way ? was it regarded as a terrorist siege and how did that affect management of the siege ? what options existed for management including use of police marksmen and other possible actions ? by what process was the siege to be managed at the time of this siege , how did that plan work and how is it said to be assessed now ?			1

the two police marksmen who stormed the @entity48 cafe fired 22 rounds
the hail of gunfire and stun grenades was a crazy adrenaline charged scene
the inquest has *suppressed* the two marksmen 's names
the actions of ' officer a ' and ' officer b ' and their commanders has been subject to criticism
the officers shot @entity307 13 times , twice in the head , killing him
@entity399 will determine whether the siege was ' properly managed
