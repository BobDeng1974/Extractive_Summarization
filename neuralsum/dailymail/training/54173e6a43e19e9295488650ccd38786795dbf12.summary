the operator told him that a driver had refused to take the fare because he was worried about the couple 's two labrador guide dogs damaging the black leather seats in his silver @entity36			1
mr @entity10 , 35 , and 32 - year - old @entity37 , who has been registered blind since the age of 13 , then had to wait a further 20 minutes for another taxi driver to pick them up and take them home , on july 8 last year			1
the couple reached their destination with dogs @entity45 and @entity47 but then complained to @entity48 who brought charges against @entity18 under the @entity51			1
@entity18 later claimed that the real reason was that he was allergic to dogs and was scared of them as he had been attacked by dogs when he was a child in @entity56 , @entity57			1
the driver , who has been in the @entity9 for four years , also claimed that he did not think his car was big enough for the two dogs			2
he was prosecuted by the council and admitted a charge of breaking his licence conditions by refusing to pick up a disabled person and his assistance dog			1
@entity18 , 32 , was fined £ 165 and ordered to pay £ 1,233.50 costs after he admitted refusing to transport the couple			1

mr @entity10 who works in computer sales said had been left ' embarrassed and humiliated ' by @entity18 's refusal to take the dogs			1

the act requires equal treatment for everyone in access to employment as well as to private and public services - such as taxi cabs			2
this must be given regardless of the ' protected characteristics ' of age , disability , gender reassignment , marriage and civil partnership , race , religion or belief , sex , and sexual orientation of the people concerned			2
in the case of disability , employers and service providers are under a duty to make reasonable adjustments to their workplaces to overcome barriers experienced by disabled people			2

' when the cab failed to turn up about 15 minutes after it was expected , i called back to ask what had happened			0
' the operator told me that they were sending another car because the nearest driver was refusing to pick us up as he had leather seats and was concerned about our dogs			1
' apparently the operator told him that it was the law that he had to pick us up , but he still refused			1
' it was a ridiculous reason because guide dogs are trained not to climb on furniture or sit on seats			0
' are always well behaved and sit in the footwells of cars or go in the boot of hatchbacks if the parcel shelf is out			0
' @entity11 usually sits at the front of cabs with the seat pushed back and @entity45 at her feet and @entity47 goes in the back in the rear footwell next to me			1
' all taxi drivers are required to carry guide dogs unless they have a certificate giving them exemption for medical reasons			0
' we felt embarrassed and humiliated			1
imagine if you were denied a cab ride because of the sex or the colour of your skin ? it is discrimination			0
' i decided to make a stand by complaining to the council and they were very sympathetic			0
i am glad that they pursued the case in court			0
' i want this to send a message out to other taxi drivers that they have to abide by the law			0
i want to speak out because there might be other blind people who do n't feel confident enough to do so			0
' mr @entity10 said the cab company was not to blame for the driver 's behaviour			1
he added : ' i want to make it clear that they have always been excellent and have assisted us in every way possible			0
we are still using them regularly			0
' we are also glad that the driver is still working there			0
i do n't think it is right that he should lose his job over it			0
' @entity16 council solicitor @entity205 told magistrates that @entity207 was the closest driver in the area and had initially accepted the fare			0
but then he turned down the fare when he realised he would have to transport the dogs , telling his controller that he was worried about his seats , said mr @entity205			2
the court heard how @entity18 applied for an exemption certificate last august to give him the right to refuse to carry guide dogs on the grounds that he was allergic to dogs			1
but his application was refused after he had pin - prick tests which showed he was not allergic to them			2
@entity18 claimed yesterday that he had not refused to pick up the dogs because of his leather seats			1
he said : ' i think i am allergic to dogs			0
they make my throat sore and i do n't like them			0
' i have taken one dog at a time in my cab without any problem			0
it was because there were two dogs			0
i did n't think it was safe and i thought a bigger car was needed			0
' also i was frightened because i was attacked by two dogs when i was young			0
psychologically , i did n't want to pick them up			2
' @entity239 , the @entity16 portfolio holder for @entity48 , said : ' we will not tolerate any discriminatory behaviour by taxi drivers whether it is on the grounds of disability , sex , religion or ethnic origin			0
