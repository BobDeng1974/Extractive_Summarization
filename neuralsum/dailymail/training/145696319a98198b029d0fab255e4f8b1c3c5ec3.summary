' the delays at immigration are likely to be so long that passengers could not be safely accommodated within the terminals and would need to be held on arriving aircraft			1

deputy prime minister @entity249 said : ' clearly we 're going to do everything we can - notwithstanding the terrible disruption and , frankly , cost to the economy these strikes will create - to make sure that systems , including our borders are properly policed and properly controlled			0
' but my message to the trade union bosses who are corralling their members into conflict is : let the teachers and the nurses and the doctors , and so on , let everybody take a bit of time to look at the information that we 've provided on our government website so people can look for themselves at what we 're offering			0
' actually what we 're offering is reasonable and generous			0
we 're saying all your pension entitlements you 've got until now will be protected ; if you 're going to retire within 10 years there will be no change ; if you 're on a low or middle income your pension will be the same , if not better than it was before			0
' i think the trade union bosses are really doing a disservice - obviously to the public - but also to their own members by not allowing their members to make up their own minds based on the information that we 're providing in our reasonable offer from the government			0
