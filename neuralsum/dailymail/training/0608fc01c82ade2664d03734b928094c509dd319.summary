the unnerving character is shown standing knee - deep in water , and waves at the camera while otherwise staying completely still			1
he is then filmed climbing out of the lake , in @entity4 's @entity16			1
beforehand he was only snapped by chance when people on the streets in @entity4 saw him			1
he has recently taken to playing games with those who follow his @entity33 page , leaving clues about his next appearance			2
earlier this week he dropped hints before appearing to dedicated fans on @entity40 's @entity39 - a reference to the nightmare on @entity39 horror films			0
emerging : at the end of the clip the @entity4 clown steps out of the lake clown about town : the anonymous figure has been snapped by pedestrians all around @entity4 the timing of the images coincided with the arrival on stage of pop group @entity55 , who were playing just a few hundred yards away from the park at @entity58			1
he posted a link on his @entity33 group detailing his exploits with the caption : ' so you are all at a gig ... but just down the road i emerged ...			0

the clown - who wishes to remain anonymous - said : ' i just wanted to amuse people			2
most people enjoy being a bit freaked out and then they can laugh about it afterwards			0
' it 's like watching a horror movie , when people get scared they usually start laughing - naturally , some people would have been extremely frightened by what they saw			0
but i hope many are starting to see it as a bit of harmless fun			0
