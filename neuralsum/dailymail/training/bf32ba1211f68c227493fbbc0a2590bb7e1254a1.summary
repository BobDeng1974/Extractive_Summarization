goalkeeper @entity0 seems content that he is to remain a @entity2 player at least until january after staying put on transfer deadline day			1
@entity4 had been offered @entity0 by @entity2 , but the goalkeeper , who has lost his place at @entity7 to @entity8 , was believed to favour a move to a @entity11 club			1
he will remain at @entity2 in his 11th season at the club			2
he tweeted : ' @entity14 is the colour ! " ... it has n't changed ... ;-) have a good night everyone			1
' @entity2 did not wish to let him join a rival , in either the @entity20 or @entity21 , but were keen to treat their legendary goalkeeper with respect			2
bags packed : @entity0 ( left ) looked set to leave @entity2 on transfer deadline day , but nothing materialised embarrassment of riches : @entity0 ( right ) has lost his place in the @entity2 team to @entity8 ( left ) @entity0 would initially give little away when questioned about his future on monday , however			1
' i 've been at the club for 10 years , the situation is now new to me , ' he told sport.cz			0
' the three opening matches i could not play for the team			0
i have no reason to panic , pack up and leave			0
' i am a @entity2 player , where i have two more years of contract			2
' in football , nothing can be predicted in advance , nothing is ever perfect			0
' a lot of players go on representative duty , yet still many transfer clubs			0
bright future : @entity4 have already signed @entity49 21 keeper @entity50 from @entity51 for £ 6million legend : @entity0 has gone down in history at @entity7 after a glittering career with @entity2 appearances : 477 clean sheets : 220 trophies : 1x @entity58 1x @entity59 3x @entity20 4x @entity60 2x @entity61 @entity63 shield ' the offer would have to be right for everyone			1
i do not exclude anything ( or ) know the answer			0
' @entity4 have already signed @entity50 from @entity51 for £ 6million and @entity69 is their first choice			0
they recently allowed @entity73 @entity72 goalkeeper @entity71 to leave for @entity74			0
it is believed that @entity0 was offered to @entity4 last week , ahead of them completing the signing of @entity50 from @entity79 club @entity51			1
@entity80 could still test @entity0 's resolve to stay in @entity49 in january			1
@entity80 were ruled to have breached the rules last season and have been forced to limit transfer expenditure , meaning a loan deal could be possible			1
@entity80 see @entity0 as the ideal man to help them win the @entity58 , deeming him better than current no 1 , @entity90 @entity89 , and would have no problem matching his wages .			2
