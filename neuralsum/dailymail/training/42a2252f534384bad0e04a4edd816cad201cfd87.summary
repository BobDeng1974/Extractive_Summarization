by @entity0 , political editor published : 10:42 est , 26 june 2012 updated : 04:12 est , 27 june 2012 @entity1 scrapped a 3p rise in fuel duty yesterday in yet another @entity4			1
the chancellor said the move – greeted with delight by campaigners and motoring groups – reflected the ‘ very difficult economic times ’			1
a duty rise in january had previously been axed and the latest freeze knocks £ 2.10 off the cost of filling up a typical family car			1
embarrassing : in yet another budget backtrack , mr @entity1 told the @entity16 that the levy would now be 10p a litre lower than under the plans inherited from @entity20 mr @entity1 had already staged four major @entity21 , on pasties , caravans , charities and church works			1
his latest retreat follows weeks of pressure from motoring groups , industry leaders and even @entity31 mps who said the economy could not afford a tax hike			2
defying the calls , the chancellor had insisted the duty rise was necessary to reduce the government ’s deficit			2
mixed messages : the climbdown comes just a day after transport secretary @entity41 said she was not prepared to stand in the way of the planned rise in fuel duty only two days ago , transport secretary @entity41 rejected a rethink as well , insisting it was better to pressure retailers to reduce pump prices			1
shadow chancellor @entity49 , who called yesterday morning for the 3p rise to be axed , said it was ‘ the fastest u-turn in history ’			2
treasury sources insisted it was not a u-turn because the hike – scheduled for august – was a policy from the last @entity20 government			0
mr @entity1 told @entity30 the £ 550million in lost revenue would be made up for by lower than expected departmental spending			1
he said fuel was 10p a litre cheaper than it would have been under @entity20 ’s plans			2
‘ we are on the side of working families and businesses and this will fuel our recovery at this very difficult economic time for the world , ’ the chancellor added			1
treasury sources said the move was discussed a month ago by the @entity77 ’s all - powerful ‘ quad ’ – @entity78 , mr @entity1 , @entity79 and @entity80			1
‘ at the @entity4 we decided to review the situation over the summer , ’ said an insider			0
‘ since then , the international situation has deteriorated and the economy went back into recession			0
‘ oil and pump prices are falling , but are still high by historical standards			0
as for @entity49 , it ’s the classic opposition tactic of trying to guess what the government will do and calling for it			0
’ the source insisted it was routine for changes to fuel duty to be announced outside @entity4 statements , saying @entity20 had done so four times			1
but there were counter-claims that the final decision was only taken yesterday , ahead of the chancellor ’s last scheduled appearance before the @entity16 before the summer recess			2
petrol prices have fallen to an average of 133p a litre , from 138p in march			0
where does your money go ? breakdown of the cost of fuel if the 3.02p fuel duty increase had been approved for this august claim : mr @entity1 said fuel was 10p a litre cheaper than it would have been under @entity20 's plans going up : how the price of petrol and diesel keeps rising although for the past year the cost of brent ( crude ) oil has fallen , but prices have remained high professor @entity125 of the @entity126 said : ‘ this is good news for drivers and good news for the country			1
road transport powers the nation ’s economy and it is welcome that the chancellor recognises the huge pressures the country ’s 35million drivers are under with transport being the biggest single area of household expenditure bar none			2
’ @entity142 , deputy director - general of the @entity143 , said : ‘ this decision will be welcomed by hard - pressed families and businesses across the country			2
’ jibe : shadow chancellor @entity49 , who called yesterday morning for the 3p rise to be axed , said it was ' the fastest u-turn in history ' the @entity153 said freezing duty would spare the typical two - car family a £ 6.41 - a - month increase in petrol costs – £ 76 a year			1
its president , @entity158 , said : ‘ this is great news for all motorists as drivers will breathe an enormous sigh of relief with summer holidays about to take off			0
‘ a duty increase at the same time as the @entity166 would have cast a shadow over the @entity168			0
’ @entity169 , of the campaign group @entity170 , said : ‘ businesses and hard - working families across this country will breathe a grateful sigh of relief , at least for the rest of this year			0
’ conservative mp @entity177 , who has led a campaign for a fuel duty freeze , said : ‘ motorists across the country will welcome the cut			1
it will greatly improve the performance of the economy			0
’ some @entity31 mps are angry that they have been defending a position their leaders were planning to give up just two hours before the chancellor made his announcement to the @entity16 , party whips circulated ‘ lines to take ’ to mps , suggesting they attack @entity20 ’s ‘ hypocritical ’ position			0
mr @entity49 , who used an article in @entity196 and tv interviews to urge a government rethink , said yesterday : ‘ this is the fastest u-turn in history			0
@entity20 called for this help for families and businesses this morning and i welcome the fact the chancellor backed down this afternoon			0
‘ with u-turns on petrol , pasties , caravans , charities and churches , @entity1 ’s @entity4 is now in tatters – a true omnishambles of a budget from a part - time chancellor whose reputation is now badly damaged			1
’ august ’s 3p rise has been postponed until january .			0

@entity1 says move reflected ' very difficult economic times '
tories have already reversed *unpopular* tax changes on pasties , caravans , charitable giving and church improvements
it comes just a day after transport secretary @entity41 said she was not prepared to stand in the way of the planned rise in fuel duty
@entity234 admits even @entity78 was not told of the decision prior to announcement
the £ 500 million boost to motorists can be paid as a result of departmental savings across @entity243 , the @entity238 said
