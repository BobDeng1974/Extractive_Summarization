other complaints included a problem with gym equipment and a problem with @entity60 games , which are available as an incentive to prisoners			2
of more than 750 grievances logged in the first three months of this year , only around 30 were of the most serious nature , involving issues with or allegations against staff , such as assault or bullying			1

one of the first complaints of the year came from an inmate who had not received a @entity110 card			2
he was advised that there was no outstanding post			0
a spokesman for the @entity115 said : ' prisoners are expected to raise concerns so their matter can be addressed appropriately			0
' the formal complaints system exists so they can raise more important issues			2
often topics raised under the complaints system are more appropriate to be dealt with by other means , but are registered as a complaint			0
' issues that can seem quite minor can cause disproportionate concern to prisoners			0
' a formal complaints system plays an important part in defusing these concerns			0
