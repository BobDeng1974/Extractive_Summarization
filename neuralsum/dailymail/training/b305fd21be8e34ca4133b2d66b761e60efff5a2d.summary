a little sunshine could be good for your heart			0
a short , sharp blast from a tanning lamp can cause blood pressure to fall , scientists have found			1
the results suggest that well - meaning advice to avoid the sun to protect against skin cancer may in fact be raising the odds of heart problems			0
getting some sunshine can lower blood pressure and cuts the risk of heart attacks or strokes , according to a recent study at @entity20 with high blood pressure trebling the chance of heart attacks and strokes , researchers believe the benefits of sunlight may outweigh the risks of skin cancer			1
the study by experts at @entity20 and @entity32 universities exposed the skin of 24 healthy young men to a sun lamp for 20 minutes and measured their blood pressure			1
diastolic pressure – the lower of the two figures in a blood pressure reading – dropped significantly and remained low for at least half an hour after the lamp was switched off			1
studies into sunlight usually credit vitamin d with any health benefits , but in this case a different compound was at work			0
it is thought that the @entity50 rays emitted by the lamp triggered the release of a compound called nitric oxide from the skin			1
researchers have found sunshine can alter levels of the small messenger molecule , nitric oxide ( no ) , in the skin and blood , reducing blood pressure it then travelled to the blood vessels and relaxed them , causing blood pressure to fall			1
the researchers wrote in the @entity69 that even a small drop in blood pressure cuts the risk of heart attacks and strokes			1
@entity75 , professor of experimental medicine at @entity20 , said : ‘ every little change might help			0
’ the findings could help explain why rates of heart disease go up in the winter – and why cardiac health is worse in countries further from the equator			2
the professor said it will be important to check that the benefits are not limited to a quick blast of uv light in a lab but persist in the real world where people are exposed to sunlight every day			0
if the sun ’s rays do prove to be beneficial for the heart , the professor said health advice on tanning should be reviewed			2
he said that despite concern about skin cancer , heart disease is a far bigger killer			0
in @entity104 , skin cancer kills 2,800 people a year while heart disease and strokes claim more than 160,000 lives annually and every seven minutes someone in the @entity104 dies from a heart attack			2
professor @entity75 said that fear of skin cancer has left some people scared of the sun. others may not be getting enough sunlight because they spend their work and leisure time indoors			0
the study involved exposing the skin of 24 healthy individuals to ultraviolet ( @entity50 ) light from tanning lamps for two sessions of 20 minutes each			0
the results suggest that @entity50 exposure dilates blood vessels and significantly lowers blood pressure he added : ‘ avoiding excess sunlight exposure is critical to prevent skin cancer but not being exposed to it at all out of fear , or as a result of a certain lifestyle , could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease			1
we are concerned that well - meaning advice to reduce comparatively low numbers of deaths from skin cancer may inadvertently increase the risk of death from heart disease and stroke			2
’ he added that his research is too preliminary to advise people on how much sun they should be getting			0
n @entity152 can also ease the early stages of multiple sclerosis , a separate study found			1
@entity155 is a neurological condition affecting around 100,000 people in the @entity104 , causing problems with vision , balance and the bladder			2
research by @entity163 published in online journal @entity165 found that boosting vitamin d could reduce the severity of ms. @entity169 , professor of epidemiology and nutrition at @entity163 , said : ‘ because low vitamin d levels are common and can be easily and safely increased by oral supplementation , these findings may contribute to better outcomes for many @entity155 patients			0

@entity104 study found sunshine can change levels of the molecule , nitric oxide
this has been shown to improve blood pressure and cardiovascular health
study suggests cutting out sun exposure completely may increase the risk of conditions related to cardiovascular disease
