' it is quite obvious that this lady , who is a professional escort lady , did not deliberately go to that house with the intention of beating up this man			0
' we have a man who has a history of behaviour which is consistent with some form of provocation , to which she overreacted			0

' on this night he was very drunk , having been drinking all day			0
' the account of what took place that night comes from you and i bear in mind your lack of previous convictions			0
' it went wrong and as a result of his behaviour or you not wanting to do what he wanted you to do because he was smelly , possibly smelling of urine , and dirty , there was a struggle between you			0
' you tried to leave and he tried to prevent you , and in the course of you trying to free yourself you kicked him			0
