by @entity0 ask @entity1 about the fact virtually everyone thinks him a racing certainty for a wild card for the @entity6 at @entity7 next month , and he smiles knowingly			1
‘ that would be a lovely little story for you if i start agreeing with all that , would n’t it ? ’ he said			2
‘ you ’re not having that			2
what can i say ? it ’s hardly for me to say i should be getting a wildcard			2
’ every two years the tasty sub-plot at the @entity18 is the pivotal role it plays in deciding the last spots for the two @entity6 teams , and this year ’s promises to be a belter			1
we 'll cross that bridge when we come to it : @entity27 and @entity1 practised together at @entity28 playing to the galleries : @entity1 engages with the crowd on his way round @entity28 six years ago basically , as far as @entity33 are concerned , there are seven players whom you could throw a blanket over chasing two spots plus three wildcards , with an eighth , @entity40 , somewhat adrift but a definite contender for the latter			1
as things stand , @entity45 ’s top 10 at the @entity44 last week has taken him into eighth place , with @entity48 now clinging to the last automatic spot over @entity50 by the skin of his teeth			2
the men who can breathe easily are @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity27 and @entity59			2
just behind @entity50 and the @entity61 @entity60 in 12th spot , and just ahead of @entity63 and @entity64 , comes @entity1			1
adding to the fascination for him is the season ’s final major taking place at @entity28 , where his @entity6 reputation took off in 2008 despite the fact he finished on the losing side			1
it all came flooding back as he made his way off the tee at the par - three 14th			0
‘ i can certainly remember what happened here on the sunday because it was the most disappointed i have ever felt on a golf course , ’ he said			0
‘ i was winning my match comfortably but the news had just filtered through that we had lost			0
it ’s hard to describe what that is like other than to say you just feel horribly empty			0
what did that matter ? ‘ you ’re judged on how you perform as a team and you can hardly feel personally satisfied in those circumstances			0
’ putting in the hard yards : @entity1 chips onto the green under the watchful eye of caddie @entity94 lucky strike : @entity1 tees off at @entity28 , aware that a good performance could earn him a @entity6 spot it is a fact @entity33 have won both matches since while @entity1 has not dropped so much as a single half - point in his last seven games			1
it is the reason why ‘ the @entity103 , ’ as @entity40 wittily described how a place had to be found for @entity1 following his miracles at @entity106 , will be activated if necessary , despite the fact the man in question has not had a top 10 all summer			1
will a return to @entity28 bring about a welcome change of fortune ? ‘ it will probably look silly from the outside given my results but i am feeling good about my game , ’ he said			1
‘ i did play well here in 2008 and i need to make plenty of birdies as i did then			0
as for the @entity6 , i ’m fully aware i am not in the team but close enough that one good week can do it for me			2
so let ’s get out there and concentrate on playing well			0
’ alongside him , just as he was during that @entity6 six years ago , was his old mucker @entity27			1
‘ never a dull moment with @entity103 , is there ? ’ said @entity124 , laughing			0
like most people , the @entity127 thinks @entity1 , @entity45 and @entity50 will get in either automatically or through a wildcard , leaving two spots to fill			1
@entity124 thinks @entity40 a slight favourite for one via a wildcard but @entity48 and @entity60 look in the box seats to me			0
this week , however , could change all that			0
‘ you would n’t be surprised if something dramatic happened , would you ? ’ said @entity124			0
great drama : @entity33 celebrate as @entity1 and @entity45 in their fourballs match on the 18th in 2008 popular support : @entity1 and @entity124 sign assorted golf paraphernalia ahead of the @entity18 then there is the @entity145 team , with 11 places all but sorted : @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157			1
who gets the last one ? surely not @entity161 , from whom there was still no word , at the time of writing , as to whether he will make the starting line - up			0
what will @entity54 do next ? will @entity124 , @entity168 , @entity56 or @entity55 knock him off his no 1 perch with a win ? as if the battle for the season ’s final major was not enough , there is an obvious chance for others to have the final word regarding a @entity6 place			1
it should be some week			0
just the way @entity1 likes it .			2

@entity1 could be chosen by *captain* @entity183 as one of his two wild card picks
his *heroics* at @entity28 six years ago live long in the memory , despite @entity33 *'s* loss to the @entity145
the @entity18 plays a pivotal role in deciding the final spots for the @entity6
