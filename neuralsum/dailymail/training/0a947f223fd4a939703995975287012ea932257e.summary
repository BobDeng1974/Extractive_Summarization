by @entity0 published : 00:58 est , 25 august 2013 updated : 11:46 est , 25 august 2013 the @entity1 has a new mission – to capture an asteroid , send a spaceship to it and collect samples before returning home in less than a month round trip			1
in an effort to attain a better understanding of asteroids , meteors and other near - space objects , the space exploration arm of the @entity11 government plans to capture an asteroid , fly a crew to it in a next - generation spacecraft , take samples and return home to a splashdown in the ocean			1
funding for the project is included in the space agency ’s upcoming budget			0
the latest version of the plan was revealed in an animation made public thursday on @entity30 that has a soundtrack that sounds like it came from the ‘ @entity32			0
called an ‘ asteroid redirect mission , ’ it resembles more of a capture , and involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next - generation @entity39 , which will also be used for trips to the @entity58 and @entity59 , according to @entity1			1
in - flight : using a combination of solar power and gravity - aided thrust , the @entity39 will make the 10 day trip to the asteroid almost there ! : once arrived , the @entity39 will dock with the captured asteroid though it bares a striking resemblance to the earlier @entity68 , @entity39 can hold more crew and is far - more advanced , says @entity1			1
up to four people can be shuttled to the asteroid , compared to the maximum three in @entity68 , in a trip that utilizes both solar power and the @entity58 ’s gravitational pull to power the spacecraft , according to the video			0
once the @entity39 docks with the remote - operated asteroid capture device , the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from , the video shows			2
ready to go : once the @entity39 and the asteroid are attached , the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object up to four people can be shuttled to the asteroid , compared to the maximum three in @entity68 , in a trip that utilises both solar power and the @entity58 ’s gravitational pull to power the spacecraft the precious : the crew will then take pictures and samples of the captive space rock before returning to the @entity39 for the 10 day sojourn home once the mission is complete , @entity39 returns to earth on the same path it journeyed out on , loop around the moon included , and splashes down in an ocean – likely the @entity108 – 10 days later , as seen in the video			2
announced in the aftermath of the asteroid that exploded over @entity113 last year , injuring well over a thousand people , @entity1 plans to dedicate $ 100 million to this project in the coming year , the agency said			2
it is not clear where the leftover asteroid would be jettisoned to , if anywhere , nor is there word on what effect changing the orbit of one near - @entity123 object would have , let alone several			0
near - @entity123 objects are defined as those within 28 million miles of our home planet			0
roundabout : the @entity39 makes its roundabout journey to use gravity and conserve fuel home sweet home : the trip ends with a gentle splashdown in the ocean explaining the government supports @entity1 ’s ‘ efforts to study @entity140 , ’ space subcommittee chairman @entity136 ( @entity137 ) said during a recent hearing that the ‘ this proposal lacks in details , a justification or support from the @entity1 own advisory bodies ’ and ‘ appears to be a costly and complex distraction			0
’ undeterred , @entity1 is moving forward , the agency expects to capture its first asteroid by 2025 .			1

the plan was revealed this week in an animation released by the agency
astronauts will shuttle to and from asteroids aboard the next - generation @entity39 spacecraft
@entity1 expects to capture its first asteroid by 2025
