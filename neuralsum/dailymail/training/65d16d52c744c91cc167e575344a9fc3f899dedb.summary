the former prime minister said it @entity1 must not win any votes by taking a tougher line on immigration and @entity6			1
he said changing course now would only ' confuse ' voters @entity9 this morning launched a furious assault on @entity11 in the wake of the party 's @entity6 election triumph - describing it as ' nasty and unpleasant '			1
the former prime minister urged the @entity16 leader @entity1 to ' stand up ' and take on @entity17			1
he said mr @entity1 had to ' stand firm ' in the face of growing demands to promise an in - out referendum on @entity6 and ignore pleas from within his party to take a tougher stance on immigration			1
it came after @entity16 mp @entity27 broke ranks to demand stricter curbs on who can come to work in @entity32			0
but mr @entity9 said swinging to the right on @entity6 and immigration would only ' confuse ' @entity16 voters			2
the @entity37 's intervention this morning risks deepening the growing division within the party over how to respond to @entity11 's rise , amid growing fears that it will eat into traditional @entity16 heartlands at next year 's election			1
@entity16 mp @entity46 said mr @entity9 's interview was ' great '			0
he added , in a thinly - veiled attack on mr @entity1 , that it was ' what many of us have been wanting & waiting to hear '			1
speaking on @entity52 , mr @entity9 said : ' the way to deal with @entity11 is to stand up and take them on , because what they 're putting before people is a set of solutions that anybody who analyses where a country like @entity32 has to be in the 21st century , knows they are solutions that are regressive , reactionary and would make all the problems of the country worse , not better			1
' mr @entity9 added that mr @entity1 had to be ' prepared to stand up , to lead , to take them on ' and ' confront and expose reactionary forces '			1
when asked about the growing pressure to offer voters an in - out referendum , mr @entity9 added : ' i ’d advise him to stay firm			2
' he said : ' it ’s not as if yielding to that pressure from @entity11 has actually done the @entity76 any good at the present time			1
' for the @entity16 if it tries to follow either @entity11 on its anti-european platform or , even worse frankly , on its anti-immigrant platform , all that will happen is it will confuse its own supporters and it wo n't actually draw any greater support			1
' he said to allow a trend of ' anti-immigrant feeling ' would be a ' huge mistake for the country '			0
mr @entity9 added : ' people in @entity11 always say that the other politicians do n't get it			2
i mean , i do get it and i get them			0
you look a little bit beneath that @entity11 facade and you see something in my view pretty nasty and unpleasant			1
' veteran cabinet minister @entity103 said @entity11 voters were ' blaming foreigners ' for the country 's problems and urged @entity108 to push ahead with his plan to reform the @entity110 mr @entity9 's warning was echoed by the veteran @entity76 cabinet minister @entity103 - who also lashed out at @entity11 for pandering anti-immigration voters			1
speaking before mr @entity9 on the today programme this morning , the @entity114 former @entity76 chancellor claimed mr @entity17 was out of touch with ordinary brits who did not care that the @entity32 attracted a lot of foreigners			1
in a dig at the @entity11 leader 's comments that he felt uncomfortable listening to foreign languages on the train , mr @entity103 said : ' every western country is multi-cultural , multi-ethnic and everybody gets used to listening to foreign languages on the bus			1
young people are n't bothered by that			0
' mr @entity103 accepted immigration needed to be ' controlled ' but added that @entity32 needed foreigners to help the economy			1
he added : ' we need some people to do jobs that @entity32 people somehow ca n't be persuaded to do			0
' @entity11 's rise was ' symbolic of the disillusion ' voters felt with politics , mr @entity103 said			1
he added : ' people are blaming foreigners and blaming @entity145			1
' but he said : ' only one in 10 of the electorate voted for @entity11 ... the important thing is , really , two - thirds of the electorate could n't be bothered to vote at all			1
' i think what we have to do is firstly persuade those people - particularly younger people - actually to vote when they say they 're not interested or all the politicians are the same and all the rest of it			2
' we have to make the case , the intelligent case , why it 's in @entity32 's national interest to stay in the @entity110 , and what sensible reforms we can actually make of the @entity110 that mainstream politicians across the rest of @entity6 are likely to agree to , because they face the same problem that we do			2
' i think , actually , we need to articulate the case , as to why it 's in the national interest - particularly younger people whose future it is - that our prosperity , our political security , our role in the world actually depend on our being a leading member of the @entity110			1
' the cabinet minister dismissed suggestions his colleague @entity178 was being soft on immigration but agrees it is good for the country			2
' we 're in the 21st century , it 's no good blaming foreigners , blaming @entity184 , telling our damn politicians ' you need to look at our role in the @entity110 in terms of the malaise of the population in their prosperity and the sense of security			1
' the first thing to point out is that immigration is a feature of the 21st century in every prosperous western democracy			0
' mr @entity9 's remarks this morning came after he was criticised for complaining about voters who elected @entity200 opposed to rampant immigration – despite running an ‘ open door ’ policy on migrants while in office			0
the former prime minister said it was wrong that the debate on the @entity110 was dominated by ‘ anti-immigrant feeling and a desire to get @entity32 out of @entity6 ’			2
these , he added , were ‘ not answers to what is happening in the world ’			0
but critics pointed out that it was mr @entity9 ’s policies which caused the problems in the first place by allowing immigration to run rife over the last decade , creating the largest population explosion since @entity223 times			1
in his comments , made to a @entity226 television station , mr @entity9 said : ‘ of course we should be worried when a party like @entity11 comes first in the @entity6 election , it would be foolish not to be			2
‘ but on the other hand we also have to stand for what is correct and right for the future of @entity32 in the 21st century			0
‘ when the world is changing so fast , to end up having the debate dominated by anti-immigrant feeling and a desire to get @entity32 out of @entity6 , these are not solutions for the 21st century			0
’ but @entity239 , the @entity76 mp for @entity240 , said mr @entity9 was a member of a ‘ supranational , smug , anti-democratic elite ’			2
he added : ‘ @entity9 was in charge of this country when the floodgates were opened			0
@entity16 ’s open - door migration policy led to the largest population explosion in @entity32 in more than a thousand years			0
between 1997 and 2010 , the foreign - born population of the @entity32 increased by three million , while nearly a million @entity32 citizens left			0
in that period , the size of the foreign - born workforce nearly doubled			0
@entity32 @entity11 leader @entity17 poses for photographers at a pub ahead of a press conference in central @entity255 yesterday in 1997 , people born outside the @entity32 held two million jobs – making up around 7.5 per cent of the total workforce			2
by 2009 , that had swelled to 3.8million jobs , or 13 per cent of the total			0
labour ministers predicted in 2004 that opening @entity32 ’s labour market to millions of workers from former @entity266 countries would result in only 13,000 new arrivals			0
by the end of 2009 , more than a million workers had signed up to a @entity271 registration scheme			0
in 2009 former @entity273 aide @entity272 revealed that the increase in immigration under @entity16 was a deliberate policy designed to change @entity32			0
he said the influx of foreign nationals was intended to socially engineer a ‘ truly multicultural ’ country			0
it was also a politically motivated attempt to ‘ rub the @entity282 ’s nose in diversity ’ , he said			0
mr @entity272 , a former speechwriter to mr @entity9 , wrote that ‘ the policy of ministers from late 2000 ... was to open up the @entity32 to mass migration			0

former @entity37 says @entity11 ' pretty nasty and unpleasant ' under its facade
calls on @entity1 to ' stand up , to lead , to take them on ' and not copy policies
mocks @entity76 attempts to stem @entity11 rise by promising in - out referendum
but critics say his immigration and @entity110 policies caused problems
