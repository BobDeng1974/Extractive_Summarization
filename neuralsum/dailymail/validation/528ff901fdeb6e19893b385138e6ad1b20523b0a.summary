when @entity1 was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2006 , she was told she only had up to three months to live			1
nine years - and five grandchildren - later , the 68 - year - old retiree from @entity5 is still going strong , and all thanks to an experimental treatment involving a common vaccine			1
@entity9 , of @entity10 , @entity5 , was one of 12 cancer patients who were given a tetanus shot as part of a new study conducted at the @entity16			1
researchers found that a dose of tetanus vaccine let patients like @entity9 live longer when added to an experimental treatment for the most common and deadly kind of brain tumor , beating the odds : in april 2006 , when @entity9 was diagnosed with glioblastoma - the most common and deadly kind of brain tumor - she was given only two - three months to live matriarch : thanks to an experimental treatment involving the tetanus - diphtheria vaccine , @entity9 ( top center ) got to witness the birth of five more grandchildren it ' put the immune system on high alert , ' paving the way for the experimental treatment to work better in attacking the disease , said researcher @entity40 of the @entity16			1
in a paper released wednesday by the journal nature , she and others describe a study of 12 patients			1
some who got the tetanus shot lived years longer than those who did n't			1
dr. @entity48 of @entity16 , senior author of the report , called the results promising but noted the study was small , and said bigger studies are needed to confirm the results			1
a follow - up study has already been planned but is n't recruiting patients yet , @entity40 said			1
brain cancer experts unconnected with the work were impressed			0
the results are ' very exciting , ' said dr. @entity59 of the @entity60 in @entity61			0
while he agreed more work is required , ' what you have so far , it 's a very positive story			0
' @entity66 is otherwise known as lockjaw			0
vaccines for it are routinely recommended for children and adults			0
the new study focused on glioblastoma , which killed @entity75 sen. @entity74 in 2009			1
even after surgery to remove the tumor , it usually grows back and kills			2
the few drugs to treat these tumors have little effect			0
half of patients die within about 15 months			2
when diagnosed in @entity87 in april 2006 , ' i was told i had two to three months to live , ' @entity85 recalled in a telephone interview			1
but her family flew her to @entity16 in @entity90 because of its reputation for glioblastoma care , and she was offered a slot in the experimental study			1
cutting age treatment : @entity9 was one of 12 cancer patients who were given a tetanus shot as part of a new study conducted at the @entity16 new approach : doctors remove white blood cells from a patient and equip them with a chemical target found in the tumor			1
then they return the cells to the patient 's body , where they train the immune system to go after the cancer cells and kill them			2
' i was very positive it would help , ' @entity85 said			1
' i said , " sure , thank you			0
" i 'm still saying thank you			0
' in the years since then , she has attended her son 's wedding and gained five more grandchildren			2
now she plays soccer with six grandsons in @entity124 and @entity125			0
' i look forward to seeing the wonderful people they 're becoming , ' she said			0
she continues to visit @entity16 once a month for more cell injections			1
last november , she celebrated her 100th treatment			0
dr @entity48 said it 's not clear why she has lived so long			2
@entity9 credits the treatment and her medical care at @entity16			1
she also cited the example of her father , who is a 97 - year - old survivor of two kinds of cancer			2
' he just went about his life , and so i did the same thing , ' @entity85 said			1
at age 68 , @entity9 , plans to continue beating the odds for years to come			2
' i think i 'm good for at least another 10 years , ' she told @entity144			0
living by example : @entity85 said her father is a 97 - year - old survivor of two different types of cancer who continues to go about living his life , and she is doing the same looking ahead : she continues to visit @entity16 once a month for more cell injections and hopes to celebrate her 80th birthday positive outlook : @entity85 said when she was offered to be in the study , she was sure the experimental treatment would help the active senior says she is lucky because she can enjoy a normal life : play golf , take long walks every day and meet friends for lunch			1
the new research work that has so dramatically prolonged @entity162 's life is an example of a long - standing effort to harness the immune system to fight cancer , an approach called immunotherapy			0
the specific strategy it used is called a dendritic - cell vaccine			0
doctors remove white blood cells from a patient and equip them with a chemical target found in the tumor called cytomegalovirus , or @entity179			2
then they return the cells to the patient 's body , where they train the immune system to go after the cancer cells and kill them			0
not sitting still : the active senior says she is lucky because she can enjoy a normal life the 12 patients in the new study were treated with a combination of surgery , radiation and chemotherapy			1
all patients got an ordinary tetanus - diphtheria shot and then three injections of their own cells , spaced two weeks apart			1
then they were randomly divided into two groups			0
one group got a second , tiny dose of the tetanus - diphtheria vaccine at the place in the skin where the cells would be injected the next day			1
the other group got a dummy dose			0
the idea behind the tetanus mini-shot was that the immune system " gets revved up in this particular area " so that " the body will be more excited about what 's to come , " @entity48 said			0
cell injections continued monthly until brain scans showed tumor growing			0
for the six patients who got the dummy shot , only one was still alive two years after diagnosis , surviving for about 3Â½ years			1
still , overall results for this group indicated a small benefit from the cell injections alone , @entity40 said			0
the results were far better for patients who got the mini-shot of tetanus			2
one of them lived almost five years and another nearly six years			2
the study was funded in part by a government grant to a business venture that is licensing the technology			0
some of the authors have filed patents related to the tetanus strategy .			0

@entity85 , 68 , was diagnosed with terminal glioblastoma in april 2006
she was offered to be in a experimental 12 - patient study at @entity16
researchers gave a tetanus shot
the patients were treated with a combination of surgery , radiation and chemotherapy and tetanus - diphtheria shot
study found that patients who got the tetanus shot lived years longer than those who did n't
