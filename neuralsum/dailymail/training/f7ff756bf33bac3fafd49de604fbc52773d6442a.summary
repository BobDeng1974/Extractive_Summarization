by @entity0 published : 14:12 est , 19 march 2014 updated : 16:54 est , 19 march 2014 a @entity3 study shows that titanium - coated golf clubs can cause fires in course - side vegetation golfers are urged to swing with care after scientists proved that titanium - coated clubs can cause course - side vegetation to burst into flames			1
scientists at the @entity3 , proved that titanium - coated clubs can cause sparks that ignite vegetation			1
@entity17 capt. @entity16 said wednesday that the results confirm a suspicion investigators have had for years - that titanium alloy clubs were the cause of at least two blazes on area golf courses			1
one blaze burned 25 acres at @entity26 's @entity25 in 2010			0
a second fire , sparked at @entity28 in @entity29 , burned close to homes			2
' the common denominator was each golfer used a titanium club , and hit the ball just out of bounds next to dry vegetation where the ground was extremely rocky , ' @entity16 said			2
scientists painstakingly re-created in the lab course the conditions on the days of the fires			2
using high - speed cameras and electron microscopes , they found that if hit upon a rock , clubs containing titanium can produce sparks of up to 3,000 degrees that will burn for more than a second , said @entity49 , a chemical engineering and materials science professor and an author of the study			1
' and that gives the spark plenty of time ' to ignite nearby foliage , he said			2
' titanium reacts violently with both oxygen and nitrogen in the air			0
' in contrast , when standard stainless steel clubs were used , there was no reaction			0
most golf clubs have steel heads but many manufacturers also make ones with a titanium alloy component in the head			1
such alloys are 40 per cent lighter , which can make the club easier to swing , researchers said			0
@entity16 said the @entity17 is giving golfers using titanium clubs permission to break the rules and ' improve their lie ' - that is , to move their ball away from rocks and dry vegetation			1
' if they need to take a penalty , take a penalty , ' he said			0
one blaze burned 25 acres at @entity26 's @entity25 in 2010			0
a second fire , sparked at @entity28 in @entity29 , burned close to homes ( pictured )			0
