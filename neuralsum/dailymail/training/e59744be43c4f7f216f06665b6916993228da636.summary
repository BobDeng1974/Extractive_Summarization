rating : @entity0 knows what @entity1 would make of this			1
the @entity5 tycoon occupied @entity6 for many years			1
it was the hq for his shipping company , and then his @entity10 trains and hotels			1
on the top floor , he made sure there was the biggest boardroom in @entity15 , if not the world			1
it stretched the entire length of the building			1
great location , shame about the general service : the inspector found the @entity24 to be rather overpriced now it 's the @entity15 hotel - and while this @entity5 outfit has maintained something of a nautical theme ( there 's a submarine hanging over the restaurant bar and various models of container ships are dotted about ) , the vibe is super-cool , courtesy of designer @entity36			1
it 's the sort of place where you wear dark glasses when it 's raining			1
and where you do n't flinch when bumping into @entity43 coming out of the loo , or when being charged £ 10 for an ordinary glass of vino			1
it 's day two when we 're there , but please do n't give me all that guff about teething trouble			1
our shoebox costs £ 221 room only , for which we get some plastic art on the wall that looks like cows ' udders			1
the bed is at an angle , presumably in an attempt to make the room more interesting			1
one small bottle of water			1
and it 's not as if many of the rooms actually look out over the @entity73			2
mind you , the views of @entity76 from the main bar are splendid			2
we order a couple of drinks , but it takes the barman ages to produce them			2
the music is too loud , but it does n't matter because most people are taking photographs of each other rather than conversing			2
we love our table in the restaurant			2
we are near a window , and can watch joggers , skateboarders and cyclists flashing past			2
trouble is , the menu is complicated , with far too many categories : small plates ; raw ; flatbreads ; market salads ; larger dishes and ' dishes for the table , served family style '			2
' what does that mean ? ' we ask			0
' we normally recommend two people to share , ' says our waiter			0
the ribeye comes in at £ 71 - i would want to feed the whole family for that			0
with no desserts and two glasses of wine each , our bill for dinner is £ 121			0
oh , and if you order a newspaper , it 'll cost you £ 3			0
climbing into bed i feel something plastic rubbing against me			0
could be worse - it 's a glove left by whoever made up the bed			0
sorry to bang on about money , but go for the @entity127 and it costs £ 19			0
my wife has a yogurt and two slices of pineapple			0
' will that cost £ 19 ? ' i ask			0
' yes , but she can go back for more			0
' ' but she does n't want to			0
' we ask to see the manager , who , to his credit , accepts the pricing is bizarre and charges us nothing			0
i produce the plastic glove at checkout and secretly hope the smiley young man will knock something off our bill			0
