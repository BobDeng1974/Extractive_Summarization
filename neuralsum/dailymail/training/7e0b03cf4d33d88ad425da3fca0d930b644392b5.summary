by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 and @entity2 @entity3 have told @entity4 he will have to pay for his own lawyer if he wants to fight an @entity7 charge for his quenelle gesture			1
the @entity10 striker is at the centre of a race storm that could yet end with the termination of his contract at the @entity16			2
@entity4 is facing at least a five - match ban after being charged on monday — it was not officially announced until tuesday — for the gesture that is widely considered , particularly in his native @entity10 , as anti-semitic			1
@entity3 responded to that on tuesday by stating that they would conduct their own ‘ internal inquiry ’ once the @entity7 ’s disciplinary process has been concluded			1
bad morning : @entity4 drives away from training with the @entity3 squad on tuesday @entity4 has until 6pm on thursday to respond to the @entity7 and he runs the risk of seeing a suspension extended to eight or even 10 matches if he fights the charge			1
given the expense involved in bringing in a @entity29 of their own as well as a qc to chair the independent three - man commission , the @entity7 would take a dim view of such a challenge when they allege it is ‘ an aggravated breach ’ of their rules ‘ in that it included a reference to ethnic origin and / or race and / or religion or belief ’			1
after a meeting with @entity3 technical director @entity45 on tuesday , @entity4 was left in no doubt of his employers ’ position			1
while the club insisted that @entity4 remain available to new manager @entity51 for now , the 34 - year - old was told they would not be footing the bill for a top qc if he wants to stick to his stance that his quenelle was not racially motivated but ‘ anti-system ’			1
@entity57 understands that if he did then fail to avoid a lengthy ban , @entity3 might even examine the possibility of ending his £ 50,000 - a - week contract			2

’ since making the gesture against @entity71 on december 28 , @entity4 has shown no contrition			1
on the contrary , he has argued what he did was not anti-semitic			0
but the @entity7 consulted experts before presenting their case on tuesday and the fact that the comedian @entity4 was said to be supporting — @entity105 — has been prosecuted for anti-semitism and banned from performing in a number of major cities in @entity10 seriously undermines his argument			1
