the world 's first printable gun has been deemed a serious safety and security concern after a gun printed by the @entity5 exploded before it was even fired			1
this danger is matched by the problem with fully - functioning @entity9 printed guns - they work all too well			1
the blueprint for the @entity9 gun known as the @entity13 was made available online six months ago by the group @entity14 with the aim of enabling anyone to print a gun with a @entity9 printer six months ago			1
the @entity5 used the blueprints to print the plastic gun on a 3 - d printer			1
the bureau released the results of its tests on the liberator on wednesday , posting a series of videos on the tests to @entity39			0
the weapon was found to have the power to penetrate several inches of flesh as well as a human skull			0
' the bottom line is , the penetration results demonstrated that the @entity13 is a lethal weapon , ' @entity45 , chief of @entity5 's firearms technology branch told the @entity50			2
' the .380 bullets fired from the @entity13 penetrate sufficiently to reach vital organs and perforate the skull			0
' the @entity5 printed several versions of the gun using different materials			1
the gun printed in a plastic material called @entity59 exploded during the test			1
explosive : the liberator made from @entity59 exploded during testing a gun rendered in a stronger plastic known as @entity66 shot eight rounds without any problems			1
' [ the testers ] quit after eight rounds , but there was no issue with the firearm at that point , ' @entity5 spokesperson @entity69 told @entity75			0
authorities say the guns are a particular concern because they 're made of plastic which is undetectable , meaning they could be brought into areas where weapons would normally be banned such as airports , schools and courts			1
depending on the metal detector , a bullet might not be enough to set it off , and the only way the gun itself could be detected would be with an x-ray machine , which are n't used in many facilities			2
undetectable : authorities are concerned that plastic @entity9 guns could be brought into places such as schools or government buildings where metal detectors would n't find them new threat : a liberator pistol next to the 3d printer on which its components were made			1
the single - shot handgun is the first firearm that can be made entirely with plastic components forged with a 3d printer the gun manages to bypass the @entity111 by including a metal block in its make - up			2
however , the metal part of the gun does n't play any part in its function and could be removed			0
the @entity111 of 1988 expires early next month , and there is a push to have the law updated to account for printed plastic guns			0
@entity123 congressman @entity122 told the @entity124 that he 's making a ' last - ditch effort ' to renew and update the law			0
' it would be unfathomable to me if we are not able to renew thiws law right now , ' he said			0
@entity5 spokesperson @entity69 outlined the bureau 's concerns to @entity75 : ' one , they do work			2
two , they ’re not reliable , and three , they ’re undetectable , ' says @entity69			0
' and that ’s a safety and security issue because they can make their way into secure facilities			0

the liberator is the first @entity9 printed gun
the @entity5 tested several versions of the gun in different plastics
one made of @entity59 exploded before it was fired ; another of more durable plastic fired eight shots easily
authorities say the gun is a safety and security concern because it 's not detected by metal detectors
