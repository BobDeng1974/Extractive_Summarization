the older of the two @entity10 ‘ bombers’married his @entity1 convert wife in a quickie ceremony in a cramped office above a mosque in front of just five friends and family , @entity0 can reveal today			1
@entity11 and @entity12 exchanged vows and were given an @entity15 blessing in june 2010 as they stood in front of a cluttered desk with a dusty filing cabinet to their side			1
the few onlookers squeezed into the 8 - foot - by - 12foot room and would have had to move a patio chair outside so they could all fit			2
it is not clear if their parents even attended the 15 minute service which did not end with the bride and groom kissing but instead concluded with a simple handshake from the @entity32			1
cramped : this is the tiny office in the @entity34 of @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37 , where @entity11 and @entity12 were married quickie wedding : @entity11 called the imam at the mosque and asked ' @entity41 ' if he would perform the wedding ceremony secret ? it 's unknown whether either @entity11 's family or ms @entity12 's family knew about the wedding or approved of it at the time the unlikely location of the mosque - a 15 minute drive from the home in @entity53 , @entity37 , that the couple were sharing - suggests they may have wanted to avoid the scrutiny of their families as they ‘ just wanted to get married ’			1
it is also not clear if their mothers and fathers approved of the wedding - @entity11 ’s mother @entity63 arranged marriages for his two sisters - but by that stage @entity12 may have already been pregnant with their child , now aged around three			1
a few months earlier she had quit her communications degree at @entity70 near the end of her third out of four years			0
@entity11 set up the wedding by phoning @entity72 at the @entity74 mosque in a run - down area of @entity36 , @entity37 , out of the blue and asking him to officiate			1
the ceremony took place in his third floor office above the mosque which is up a creaky and badly lit set of wooden stairs			1
legally wed : @entity11 and ms @entity12 filed the paperwork to get married on june 21 , 2010			1
ms @entity12 may have already been pregnant with the couple 's daughter handshake : @entity72 performed the 15 - minute ceremony in his office			1
it ended with him shaking the hands of the bride and groom inside there is just enough room for a desk , a bookcase at the back and a dust - covered tv on the floor			1
the two windows are covered with gold curtains with patterns on them and there is a coat stand on which @entity106 keeps his ceremonial white robe			0
the service took place on june 21 2010			2
speaking to @entity0 , @entity106 said : ‘ i only saw him for 15 minutes			2
‘ his wife asked if i could marry them and i said as long as you have your licence i will be able to marry you			0
they got the licence and i married them and that was it			2
i did n't know him before			0
’ @entity106 said that he recalls giving a blessing about ‘ the importance of the institution of marriage , being respectful of each other and the vows you take , you take a sacred vow to live under the banner or shade of @entity130			0
' there were about five people present and witnesses but he could not recall if any of them were parents			0
the imam condemned the bombing of the @entity10 and said he never could have foreseen that @entity11 would commit such an act he said : ‘ they were happy to get married			1
‘ we opened up with a prayer , the first chapter of @entity142			0
we would recognise what they were doing and the sacred bond of marriage , they gave their vows and that 's it			0
‘ some people want a 30 minute marriage , some people want an hour marriage			2
they just wanted to get married , so it was a 15 minute marriage			1
’ it is not clear if @entity12 had already converted to @entity15 at that stage as , under @entity1 law , a @entity1 man can marry somebody from outside the religion so long as he is a believer			1
@entity106 said there was no kiss for the bride at the end of the service			2
he said ‘ we do n't have that as part of the ceremony			2
after they took their vows , we gave each other the greetings and left			0
‘ we said as - @entity173 , or peace be upon you , shook hands and left			2
’ the wedding certificate , which @entity0 has obtained , lists the groom as @entity11 and @entity179 as the bride			1

@entity11 ’s job is listed as a driver whilst @entity12 says she is a student			1
she later became a healthcare assistant working 80 hours a week whilst he stayed at home with their child			0
attention : ms @entity12 has received large amounts of national attention since it was revealed that she converted to @entity15 and married @entity11 @entity11 is believed to have ' self - radicalized ' over his hatred of the @entity200 and @entity201 wars and his feeling that he needed to ' defend @entity15 ' two months later the newlyweds took their wedding certificate to a registrar who signed it off and put her own signature on it , making it official in the state of @entity37			1
asked what he thought about the @entity10 bombings , which @entity11 allegedly carried out with younger brother @entity213 , 19 , @entity106 said it was ‘ terrible ’			1
@entity11 died in a hail of bullets as the pair tried to flee police and @entity213 sustained serious injuries			2
he has now been charged over the deaths of three people and the injuries sustained to more than 180			0
@entity106 said : ‘ when somebody hurts people for political reasons , it 's a terrible circumstance			0
‘ i do n't think any religion can justify the things that people do todayunder the guise of religion			0
‘ when someone is asking to get married you 're not looking into the future			0
‘ you 're looking at that time that you 're with that couple			0
you expect that that couple that 's in front of you will live a good @entity130 - conscious life			0
‘ you do n't perceive what happens ( later )			0
