by @entity0 a man who weighed a whopping 800lbs when he was just 16 years old has shed almost 600lbs over the space of a decade ; almost 75per cent of his body weight			2
@entity5 , now 27 , based in @entity6 , @entity7 , lost the weight without any assistance , drugs or surgery ; simply by eating smaller , healthier meals and by very gradually building up an exercise routine , he tells @entity14 on the today show			1
' my first exercise was just standing up and sitting back down , ' he explained			0
' that was very painful			0
my back started hurting , my legs started hurting			2
that was a workout for me			0
' @entity22 : @entity5 weighed 800lbs by the time he was 16 ( left ) and was told he would die if he did n't shape up , so he gradually managed to lose almost 600lbs over the space a decade ( right , now , at 235lbs ) mr @entity5 says he struggled with stress and ' severe anxiety , ' as a teen and turned to food as a source of comfort			1
' i was starting to get addicted to food			0
if i could do anything , i ’d marry food			0
i loved it that much , ' he admits			0
his breaking point came when , at the age of only 16 , his doctors informed him he would die if he did n't lose weight , according to an account he wrote for @entity43			1
' i just knew that i had to focus on the day i was living			0
i had a “ lose weight or die trying ” mentality , ' he wrote			1
then and now : back when he was obese ( left ) , mr @entity5 ( also right ) says he was ' addicted to food , ' because it eased his chronic anxiety , but eventually snapped and adopted a ' lose weight or die trying mentality ' total turnaround : ' my first exercise was just standing up and sitting back down , ' he recalls , which was ' very painful , ' but he built strength over time and now exercises and lifts weights for 90 minutes a day after mr @entity5 had mastered standing for a couple of minutes at a time , then taking more steps each day , he achieved a one mile walk , which took him 33 days to complete			1
then , he joined his local @entity62 - mr @entity5 says his ' belief in @entity64 ' played a ' significant ' part in his transformation - and started walking for up to an hour , five or six days a week			1
eventually , he was running 5k 's			0
after reading up on portion control on the internet , he turned his eating habits around too : ' i went from eating white breads , processed meats , and other high - fat , high - sugar foods to more natural foods , like egg whites , whole - grain breads , whole - grain cereals , milk , cheese , fruits and vegetables			0
' taking it on : mr @entity5 ( left , in his youth ) says his ' belief in @entity64 ' played a ' significant ' part in his transformation to the happy , healthy man he is today ( right ) wo n't be needing those anymore : mr @entity5 ( right ) is now a passionate healthy - living coach , motivational speaker , and author on jan 1 of this year , mr @entity5 , who has undergone skin - reduction surgery , gave up ' sweet junk food , ' as well			1
his weight loss has been gradual , but consistent			2
at his lowest , he weighed 207lbs , but he has since taken up weightlifting to build lean muscle mass , and now weighs 235lbs - working out for about 90 minutes every day			2
these days , there does n't appear to be a trace of the anxious , unhappy teenage boy he left behind			2
mr @entity5 is now a passionate healthy - living coach , motivational speaker , and author , whose latest ebook is entitled overcoming the monday mentality .			1

as a teen , @entity5 , now 27 , was told by doctors that he would die if he did n't lose weight
without any assistance , he *modified* his diet and *slowly* started exercising
now a motivational speaker , mr @entity5 weighs 235lbs
