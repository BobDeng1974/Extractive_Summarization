by @entity0 a firefighter thought he could solve his dental problems without spending a fortune by having surgery in @entity5			1
but the money he saved ended up causing more trouble than it was worth after his teeth began to fall out following a botched operation			1
@entity11 , 53 , needed dentures due to decades of drinking fizzy drinks and a fear of the dentist that meant he delayed getting his decaying teeth fixed			1
smiling again : @entity11 has finally got adequate dentures after first wasting money on botched surgery abroad he then got into a play fight at work that caused his false teeth to break , leaving him with just five teeth			1
the firefighter admits his toothless smile left him self - conscious about his appearance			1
he said : ' i did n't smile as much as i used to			0
i used to have a nice smile in my younger days			0
' his girlfriend , @entity32 , added : ' he became quite withdrawn with it , he did n't want to speak out loud with it			0
he became very conscious of his teeth all the time			2
' the firefighter had just five teeth and dentures he had fitted in @entity5 kept breaking and falling out @entity11 lived with the problem for two years as he investigated how it could be solved			1
he could n't afford to have the surgery in @entity42 so he looked at having it done aboard and discovered it would cost half as much			1
he recalled : ' the prices in @entity42 were between £ 16,000 and £ 21,000 which i thought was a lot of money			1
' i found a surgery in @entity5 that offered cheap implants and free accommodation			1
it took me a long time to actually decide to go for it			0
they offered me a discount of £ 500 if i paid in cash			2
' he opted for a fixed palate with a lifetime guarantee which cost £ 6,500 upfront in cash			2
' over the last 10 years , we 're seeing more and more the results of disasters which are emanating from cosmetic surgery tourism ' @entity11 said : ' the teeth were actually taken out in @entity69 and then i went to @entity5 for surgery			1
it was very professional , and it all looked very clean , very hygienic			2
immediately afterwards my teeth were good , strong and i had a nice smile			2
' however three months later , he was horrified when one of the teeth broke off completely when he munched a chocolate bar			2
' i bit into a @entity80 bar and thought , this is a bit crunchy , this @entity80 bar			0
i pulled the bit out and it was a bit of tooth , ' he said			0
he contacted the company in @entity5 and was given a replacement tooth but three weeks later , another one fell out and then yet another			1
soon the whole bridge holding his teeth snapped			2
even though he had a ' lifetime guarantee ' he was told he would have to return to @entity90 at his own cost to have a replacement , which he would also have to pay for			0
sweet tooth : eating a @entity80 bar caused @entity11 's teeth to come out after he had botched surgery the replacement eventually snapped too and @entity11 was left worse off than he was before and down £ 10,000			1
when he complained , he was only given a 25 per cent refund			0
@entity99 , a consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon based in the @entity42 , said @entity11 is one of many victims of inadequate and unscrupulous surgeons who tempt brits aboard with discount deals			1
he said : ' over the last 10 years , we 're seeing more and more the results of disasters which are emanating from cosmetic surgery tourism			1
' an exasperated @entity11 said he now did n't know what to do : ' i 'd like a nice set of teeth			1
i 'd like to be able to properly smile again with confidence , to properly eat again			0
it would mean the world to me to have my teeth fixed			0
' his salvation finally came after he appeared on @entity121 show @entity122 : aboard and was given the teeth he 'd always wanted by cosmetics surgeon dr @entity125			0
delighted with the results , he said : ' i think i 've got an excellent smile now			0
my teeth fit together when i bite - there 's no rocking or anything			0
i 'm really , really impressed ! it 's made me good - looking again			0
' catch up on @entity133 : aboard on @entity121 on demand			0
meanwhile , botched up bodies : brides will air on @entity121 at 10pm this evening .			0

@entity11 had false teeth after years of consuming fizzy drinks
they were *knocked* out during a play fight
he was left with just five teeth
surgery in @entity42 was too *expensive* so he went to @entity5
but new dentures began to fall out weeks later
looked worse than before and he was £ 10,000 out of *pocket*
