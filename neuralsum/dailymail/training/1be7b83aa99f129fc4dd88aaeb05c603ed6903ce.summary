@entity0 has sounded a warning after 26 @entity3 bombers , tankers and fighter jets on military exercises were intercepted around @entity7 in just 24 hours			1
jets were scrambled by the @entity9 and allies in @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 after the ' unusual ' spike in activity , which saw two giant @entity17 bombers fly close to @entity18 yesterday			1
the alliance said @entity3 had conducted ' significant military manoeuvres in @entity7 airspace ' - though it then added none of the planes had strayed into any specific country 's territory			1
closely watched : @entity9 @entity27 jets were scrambled yesterday to track this @entity3 @entity17 bomber , one of two which flew close to @entity18 without filing flight plans or communicating with air traffic controllers			1
some 26 intercepts were made in around 24 hours , said @entity0 the two @entity34 bombers had been part of an eight - plane formation which was first intercepted by @entity38 f - 16s over at 2am yesterday			1
while six of the planes returned back towards @entity3 , the two @entity39 carried on south west towards the @entity18 where they were picked up by @entity42 , @entity43			1
@entity44 the scrambled @entity27 jets from @entity46 in @entity47 , northern @entity48 , which tracked the @entity34 bombers as they continued through @entity18 's ' flight information region '			1
@entity0 said : ' the bomber and tanker aircraft from @entity3 did not file flight plans or maintain radio contact with civilian air traffic control authorities and they were not using on - board transponders			1
' this poses a potential risk to civil aviation as civilian air traffic control can not detect these aircraft or ensure there is no interference with civilian air traffic			0
' followed : these images were all issued by the @entity9 and showed the moment the aircraft were escorted by @entity27 jets near @entity18 airspace @entity0 stepped up defences and said : ' these sizeable @entity3 flights represent an unusual level of air activity over @entity7 airspace ' the @entity34 bombers which flew near @entity18 ( one is pictured ) were just two of 26 @entity3 planes intercepted over @entity7 in 24 hours @entity77 @entity38 air force intercepts eight @entity3 planes – four @entity17 bombers and four @entity82 tankers – flying in formation at 2am on october 29			1
six turn back @entity85 two of the @entity34 bombers continue towards @entity18 airspace			1
@entity27 jets scrambled from @entity46 @entity90 the bombers continue to @entity90 where they are intercepted by @entity12 air force , and turn back			0
they are still airborne at 3pm @entity93 seven @entity3 fighter jets intercepted on afternoon of october 29 by @entity12 @entity95			2
just 24 hours earlier , @entity11 @entity96 intercepted the same seven types @entity98 @entity13 jets intercept four @entity3 planes – two @entity17 bombers and two @entity103 fighters – on afternoon of october 29 the @entity18 @entity27 pilots identified the @entity34 bombers visually and ' escorted ' them around the edge of @entity18 airspace , a @entity105 spokesman said			1
the @entity39 then continued towards the @entity90 to the west of @entity12 , where they were intercepted by @entity12 f - 16s before turning back			0
they appeared to be heading back to @entity3 but were still airborne by 3pm			2
@entity0 said the ' sizeable @entity3 flights ' represented an ' unusual level of air activity over @entity7 airspace			1
' but the alliance added that all the planes intercepted were , in legal terms , still in international airspace			0
@entity3 bombers and jets were also intercepted over the @entity93 and @entity98 between tuesday and yesterday afternoon			2
some 26 interceptions were made in the space of just 24 hours , although seven could have been the same planes returning to the same area			1
more than 100 @entity3 planes have been intercepted by @entity0 this year - triple the number in the whole of last year			1
the movements come after months of heightened tension between @entity133 and the @entity134 following @entity3 's annexation of @entity136 and military incursion into @entity138			2
@entity0 's new chief said today the alliance is increasing its readiness and air policing after yesterday 's flurry of activity			2
@entity145 said that while @entity0 is not back on a @entity149 footing with @entity3 , its former arch - enemy as the @entity147 , recent behaviour has severely undermined mutual trust			1
mr @entity145 said the trans - @entity90 military alliance ' remains vigilant and ready to respond '			2
' we need to keep our forces ready , therefore we are investing in high readiness , new capabilities , ' he said			0
' we are ... increasing air policing as an answer to the increased air activities we are seeing from @entity3			0
' he also urged @entity3 to remove its forces from @entity138 - @entity3 denies they are there - and warned against plans by @entity165 separatists to hold local elections in eastern @entity138			2

@entity173 f - 16s were used to escort seven @entity3 fighter jets on october 29 a @entity3 @entity34 strategic bomber - the same model which flew close to @entity18 yesterday - refuels over an unknown location during a military exercise ( file pic ) the interceptions yesterday were unrelated to a sonic boom caused by @entity9 fighter jets which shocked residents across @entity183			1
typhoons from @entity185 , @entity186 , flew to @entity183 at supersonic speeds to dramatically halt a @entity189 cargo plane on its way to @entity191 after it ' caused concern ' to air traffic controllers			0
the swoop , which resulted in the @entity196 - registered plane being grounded at @entity197 yesterday evening , sparked a massive sonic boom which was heard across a 50 - mile radius			0
soon after the incident , an unverified audio clip was posted online which appeared to have recorded the moment an @entity9 pilot warned the plane it risked being ' shot down '			0
a man was heard saying : ' i ’m instructed by @entity206 to warn you if you do not respond you will be shot down ’			0
the incidents happened on the same day @entity183 was rocked by a sonic boom as a @entity189 cargo plane was intercepted , but were unrelated grounded : the @entity189 @entity211 ( pictured ) was escorted into @entity197 after causing a brief scare yesterday the interceptions were also not said to be linked to another huge sonic boom heard yesterday over the @entity215			0
the blasts rattled buildings and left islanders shaken from @entity219 and @entity220 , a distance of more than 55 miles			0
at first locals thought there had been a blast at a local quarry or military ordnance blown up at a beach - but the @entity9 later said it was ' most likely a supersonic jet belonging to the @entity9 or @entity229 @entity168 on a routine training flight '			1
a spokesman added : ' these flights take place all the time around the @entity18 and we do n’t announce them			0
to hear a supersonic boom is rare			0
however in certain climatic conditions they can be heard and this is what most likely happened in this case			0
' @entity243 , of the @entity244 in @entity245 , said : ' the actual building shook			0
when we looked out there was people walking on the road - who were standing looking around to see what had happened			0
' the exercise is a rebuke to @entity0 , which was founded as a @entity149 - era defence body in 1949 , less than a week after it insisted the @entity3 still had troops in eastern @entity138			1
@entity3 strenuously denies the claims - but @entity0 said although it has withdrawn ' partially ' it still maintains a capable force on the border			2
@entity229 air force general @entity260 , @entity0 's top military commander , told reporters : ' make no mistake , there remain @entity3 forces inside eastern @entity138			2
' some @entity3 troops stationed near the @entity138 border had left and some others appeared to be preparing to leave , he said			0
' but the force that remains and shows no indications of leaving is still a very , very capable force and remains a coercive capability to the nation of @entity138			0

26 @entity3 aircraft ran ' military manoeuvres ' in 24 hours *including* two @entity34 bombers followed by @entity9 fighters
@entity0 steps up its defences as it says two planes near @entity18 did not file flight plans or contact controllers
@entity286 reported ' unusual ' activity after intercepting 100 @entity3 planes in 2014 - triple the number in 2013
