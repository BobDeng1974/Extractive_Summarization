due to this , it does not typically form a lump , as is expected with breast cancer , and instead causes a thickening of the tissue , making one part of the breast feel fuller than other areas			2
other symptoms including a change in the texture of appearance of the skin on the breast , such as dimpling , or an inverted nipple			0
women with this type of breast cancer are usually a few years older than women diagnosed with other types , and it is more likely to occur in both breasts compared with other types			0
the cancer is invasive , which means it has the potential to spread to other parts of the body			0
it can be found through screening tests including physical exams or mammograms			0
mammograms are encouraged yearly when a woman turns 40s or earlier if they have a family history of breast cancer			2
treatment includes removing part or all of the breast followed by chemotherapy or radiation			0
according to the @entity219 , more than 180,000 women in the @entity218 are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer each year , and about one in ten cases are invasive lobular carcinomas			2
the earlier the diagnosis , the better the prognosis			0
patients have a slightly better outlook for both short - and long - term survival compared to other types of breast cancer			0
according to a study by @entity231 , the five - year survival rate is 85 per cent .			2
