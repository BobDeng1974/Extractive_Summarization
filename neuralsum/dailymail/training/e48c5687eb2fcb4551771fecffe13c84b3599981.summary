by @entity1 reporter published : 04:04 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 04:23 est , 20 may 2013 commuters on @entity4 will no doubt cast an envious eye at these pictures of what will shortly become the world 's most luxurious metro system			0
looking more like the inside of five - star hotel , the proposed network , in @entity13 , @entity14 , will boast a space age design featuring marbled walkways , gold - plated walls and , naturally in one of the hottest places on earth , air conditioning			1
the facade will apparently be designed to let in light while keeping out the harsh desert sun , while the overall shape is meant to recall the country 's wind - blown sand dunes			0
lap of luxury : with marbled walkways , raised escalators and gold - plated walls , this proposed new metro station on @entity13 , @entity14 , is a far cry from underground railway stations in other world cities sleek : an aerial view of the new station , the design of which is based on @entity14 's wind - swept sand dunes luxury : the design will apparently let in the sun rays but air conditioning will keep commuters cool in what is one of the world 's hottest countries amazingly , the new six - line network has been ordered to be completed by the ruling @entity52 in just four years - the amount of time it took builders in @entity57 to renovate just one station			1
what will frustrate weary @entity4 commuters even more is that the main feature of the new system , a three - way interchange at the city 's busiest station , has been designed by half - @entity67 architect @entity66 , who has been behind a string of developments around the world			0
the @entity4 - based designer , who is half - @entity72 , was the brains behind developments in the capital 's @entity75 and @entity77 , as well as international projects in cities including @entity57 , @entity80 and @entity81			2
@entity1 grind ? hardly , as the spacious , marbled walkways will allow commuters plenty of room to get about quick - fire : @entity52 has ordered the new network and renovated stations to be completed in just four years talented : @entity66 , the architect behind the scheme , is based in @entity4 as has helped design a number of buildings around the world			2
