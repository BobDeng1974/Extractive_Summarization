@entity34 photographer mr @entity13 spent most of the mid- 1980s flying from job to job in small planes			1
it gave him a unique view of the odd symmetry found on the ground - sparking the unique project titled ' @entity42 '			0
mr @entity13 , 61 , from @entity43 , @entity44 , said : ' from my school days i had been interested in graphics , strange patterns and shapes			2
' looking down from a hovering helicopter you see the landscape from a birds eye perspective and suddenly everything becomes abstract and symmetrical with no distracting horizon line			1
work of art : mr @entity13 would rope in favours from friends to help create the stunning series - including mates rates on a @entity62 helicopter and hiring tractors for a ploughed field scenario but after locking the 35mm colour negatives away in a box , they have finally seen the light of day - a quarter of a century after the project 's completion all for art : the photographer 's wife lies down on stacks of piping in a piece called @entity77 in @entity43 ' i thought strategically placing a nude in these locations would emphasise the point that we as human beings are so minuscule and insignificant in relation to the enormity of the planet we live on			1
' locations for the project included a runway , a railway line and a moving car weaving through traffic			0
each one was meticulously planned , with mr @entity13 scouting potential locations from the air during his day job as a commercial photographer			2
labour of love : @entity34 photographer @entity13 spent most of the mid- 1980s shooting @entity44 's @entity101 from the air after spotting a good area , he would return to photograph it in more detail - before trying to persuade land owners to let him shoot a nude there			1

family connection : due to the reaction online @entity13 now plans to return to the project - using his 27 - year - old daughter @entity129 to pose naked on a @entity130 taking his time : on why the project has taken so long to reach a wider audience , @entity13 revealed : ' when i started the series i thought they were pretty cool , but i like to mull things around in my head ' rediscovered : ' revisiting the images 25 years later was certainly a buzz , ' said the photographer ' shooting above a local airport i had to talk the air traffic controllers into diverting incoming flights , and when i was shooting the nude on the runway the control tower suddenly filed up with men and binoculars			1
' every shot is as it appeared to @entity13 on that day - no photoshop or trickery , just a camera			1
mr @entity13 , said : ' people ask me if i used @entity155 or a drone , but it is all from nothing more than a camera , no photo editing at all			2
