by @entity1 reporter published : 12:44 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 16:49 est , 28 august 2013 an employee at a @entity4 restaurant accused of being racist for throwing out a group of 25 black patrons has turned the tables on the customers - saying they were the ones who were using racist slurs			1
@entity12 went public earlier this month with his accusations that staff at @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity4 , asked him and his 24 friends - all @entity18 - to leave after a white customer said she felt threatened by them			1
mr @entity12 's post about the incident spread across social media with viral force and resulted in condemnations of the restaurant and the staff			1
an employee contacted radio facts , a broadcast industry blog , and said it was actually the customers who were being racist			0
discriminated : @entity12 ( center ) and his family were denied service at a @entity4 restaurant after a white woman claimed she felt threatened the woman , who would not be named , told the site that because mr @entity12 and his friends were such a large group , it took longer than expected to find seats for all of them together			1
while they waited , some customers - both whites and blacks - were seated before they were , she said			2
' they kept complaining about their long wait and were talking about how “ whitey ” was able to get seated , but they were not , ' the woman wrote			0
she added : ' they made this a racial issue before anything			0
' as they waited , the group became rowdy , the employee claimed and began refusing to get out of the way for other customers to enter or leave the restaurant			1
they also insulted a deaf girl because she did not move to let them through , the woman claims			0
one member also repeatedly used the n - word			0
that was when the female customer in question became uncomfortable and complained to an employee , according to the woman			0
ignored : @entity12 says the restaurant 's corporate office ignored his multiple calls to tell them about the incident ' when asked to stop , he threw out a long string of racial epithets against one of my co-workers , ' the employee claims			1
that version of events is totally at odds with the description mr @entity12 has given			2
' she said there 's a situation where one of our customers feels threatened by your party , so she asked us not to seat you in our section , which totally alarmed all of us because we 're sitting there peaceably for two hours , ' @entity12 explained to @entity95			1
' obviously , if we were causing any conflict , we would have been ejected out of the place hours before			0
' as @entity12 and the shift manager were talking , a member of his party began videotaping the conversation , which is when the manager became upset and refused to seat the group			2
' i asked her i want to be clear with you , ' @entity12 told the station			1
' i said so you 're telling me i have to leave			0
she said i have a right to deny you service			0
i said so you 're asking me to leave because you 're upset because he was recording you , after we 've waited for two hours , and after you 've already pretty much discriminated on us , and she answered yes			2
' @entity114 : after @entity12 posted this on the restaurant 's @entity117 page , he finally got a call from the corporate office not satisfied : @entity12 says the restaurant 's offer of a free meal is n't enough for more videos , please go to @entity95 @entity12 called the restaurant 's corporate headquarters repeatedly to explain what had happened to the manager 's superiors			1
but nobody ever called him back - so he turned to @entity117			0
' i will never go to wild wings cafe in n. chs again ! we ( party of 25 family and friends ) waited 2hrs , patiently and were refused service because another customer ( @entity139 ) felt threatened by us			2
this type of racial discrimination is unacceptable and we have to put a stop to it			0
the manager looked me dead in the face and said she was refusing us service because she had a right to and simply she felt like it			0
do not support this establishment ... please share this post ... we need your help , ' he posted on the restaurant 's @entity117 page			2
after @entity12 's post started getting a bit of attention , the restaurant finally acknowledged @entity12 's complaint			1
' we got alerted through social media , so we always encourage our customers to respond to us or to comment on our social media pages , ' @entity161 , the chief marketing officer for @entity15 , told the station			1
after the post , representatives for @entity15 said they immediately responded and spoke to @entity12			2
' we had a conversation , ' said @entity161			0
' it was a really good conversation			0
he and many of his family and friends were there about a month ago , and they are regular customers of ours			0
so , they were having a going away party , and they just did n't receive the experience that they have come to know and love			0
' at no point did @entity161 deny that @entity12 's story was true			1
the restaurant offered @entity12 and his family a free meal for the entire group			1
but @entity12 is n't completely satisfied			2
' we were n't coming there for a free meal			1
when we came there that night , we were coming to patronize the business			0
this is not a situation where you can just give us a free meal and everything is ok because it 's deeper than that , ' he said			1
as of sunday night , @entity12 's post was shared on @entity117 nearly 3,000 times .			1

@entity12 and his family were asked to leave a @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity4 after the group waited patiently for two hours
the restaurant 's corporate headquarters ignored @entity12 's repeated calls to report the situation
it was n't until @entity12 told his story on social media that the restaurant acknowledged him
the restaurant then offered him a free meal
