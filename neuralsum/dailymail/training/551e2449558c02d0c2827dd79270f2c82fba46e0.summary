' as prince @entity33 said last week : " @entity26 was literally born in the @entity6 and we must not forget our @entity6 brothers and sisters			2
" ' we come to this cathedral this evening freely and relatively easily , ready to give a simple act of witness to our faith			2

christmas : the message came during @entity27 at @entity30 's @entity29 , pictured the archbishop of @entity17 ( right ) warned of the dangers to @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 â € ˜ the point though surely is that we have now reached a crisis where bridges are rapidly being deliberately destroyed by those with a vested interest in doing so			1
â € ˜ this is achieved through intimidation , false accusation and organised persecution including to the @entity26 communities in the @entity90 € ™ archbishop @entity91 also echoed @entity92 in reflecting upon hope and tenderness			2
he said at ' this pivotal moment we know how much healing we need '			0
