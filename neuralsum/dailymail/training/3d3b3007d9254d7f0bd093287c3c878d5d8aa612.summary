she was blasted during 2011 's @entity1 by @entity2 , who said she looked as though she was wearing five gallons of hairspray before standing in the middle of a hurricane			1
never one to take the music mogul 's criticism lying down , @entity7 has returned to top sartorial form on this year 's show			1
after a four - year hiatus from the talent contest , @entity7 returned to our screens - along with a new surname and whole new dress sense - and successfully stole back her fashion crown			1
heading up @entity7 's new glam squad is stylist @entity29 , who is the senior fashion editor of style bible , @entity31 , and has worked with @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
@entity29 has helped @entity7 shake up her wardrobe and break away from the play - it - safe style she has previously embraced			1
in 2010 , @entity7 came under fire for her ' tacky ' and ' skimpy ' dresses , while @entity40 was lauded for her ' edgy and fashion forward ' fashion choices and hairstyles			2
@entity7 took matters into her own hands this year by enlisting @entity29			1
the super stylist added glamorous gowns courtesy of @entity50 favourites , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 , to the judge 's wardrobe			2
now and then : in 2010 , right , @entity7 came under fire for her ' tacky ' and ' skimpy ' dresses , right , but now opts for glamorous , often midi - length or floor length designs , left the judge , who sits alongside @entity61 and @entity62 , also had couture wedding dress designer , @entity64 , waiting in the wings to help @entity29			1
@entity64 is an extremely talented designer and seamstress who has worked with many of the world ’s top designers and played a leading part in making the wedding dresses of plenty of high - profile private clients			0
classic in design or a touch avant garde , @entity64 promises that her designs will help you feel your best on your special day - something she 's most certainly helped @entity7 with this year			2
' i have worked with @entity7 's stylist @entity29 and @entity7 herself many times before			1
i designed her outfit for the @entity85 at @entity86 earlier this year and created about 25 dresses for her @entity89 ten tour , ' @entity64 told @entity90			0
@entity64 , who went along to the live shows every week to help @entity7 and @entity29 , said that @entity7 is ' lovely ' to work with and has a really good sense of humour			1
' @entity7 has been looking so good on @entity1 , ' added @entity64			1
@entity94 : high - fashion houses have been lending @entity7 the most glamorous and lavish of dresses , which she 's pulled off with aplomb week after week ( left , in @entity98 , and , right , in @entity99 ) speaking about @entity7 's style overhaul , fashion writer @entity100 ( www.theverysimong.com ) said : ' @entity7 has come a long way since the shiny @entity104 tracksuit days			1
she would n't be seen dead in one now			0
for her , it 's all about the super high - end designers now			0
' alas , even couture houses have started lending her dresses			0
and , it seems , @entity7 is doing a better job at championing new designers than our very own princess , @entity112			2
' @entity7 's fashion conquests have included : @entity115 - famed for dressing the @entity116 herself ; @entity52 - a red carpet gown genius ; @entity53 ( including the red dress she wore for the final ) - one of @entity123 's favourite designers , and @entity54 couture - one of the most fantastic couturiers in the world , who dresses royals and a list stars			1
' granted , sometimes @entity7 gets it a tad wrong , some of the dresses she has worn look a little cheap on her , but overall , i 've been impressed with the dresses her stylist has managed to pull in			2
what a difference ! speaking about @entity7 's style overhaul , fashion writer @entity100 said : ' @entity7 has come a long way since the shiny @entity104 tracksuit days			1
she would n't be seen dead in one now			0
for her , it 's all about the super high - end designers now ' ' she is at her best when she 's in a long , sweeping gown , one that accentuates her waist , bust and delicate neck line			0
and she is n't afraid of colour , which is refreshing			0
' i think my favourite of all her looks was the green @entity98 ruffle detail dress			0
i thought it would have been reserved for a @entity155 , not an @entity156 ! '			0
another important member of @entity7 's glam squad is @entity159 - one half of hair styling power duo , @entity162			1
their client list includes @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 - and now @entity7			2
@entity159 , who also tends to the tresses of @entity170 and @entity171 for their vip appearances and magazine shoots , worked backstage with the singer every weekend and was on hand between takes			0
only the best for @entity177 : @entity7 has called on @entity159 , a fashion favourite and celebrity hairdresser , to work his magic on her @entity1 hair his signature clean , modern style has made him a backstage fashion week favourite and @entity7 - who married husband @entity185 this year - has benefited			1
speaking to @entity90 about working with the pop icon , he said : ' i have worked with @entity7 a few times over the years on different projects			2
' we both had big ideas about what we wanted to achieve this season			0
the main thing was that we wanted to create lots of different looks that were alternative , versatile and cool , rather than the hair being played safe all of the time			0
it was a really collaborative effort			0
' @entity7 , who , according to @entity159 , is very much involved in the creative process , has opted to channel @entity201 icons such as @entity202 some weeks and more urban , playful looks on others			1
get the look : @entity7 , who is heavily involved in her final look , apparently wanted to channel the eternal glamour of @entity201 actresses he says one of his favourites look this season was @entity212 look he and @entity7 recently created because , he says , it was ' completely different to any of the other looks we have ever done before '			2
' we created what looked like a haircut rather than a hair style just by braiding the hair which was quite a bold thing to do , ' he explained			0
' i also really liked the @entity220 to @entity202 style we created a few weeks back			0
i know @entity7 really liked the judge ’s houses because of great texture			0
. always head of the game trend-wise , @entity159 and @entity7 championed the sleek ponytail a lot on the show , which , he says , is one of the easiest hair styles to recreate			1
in terms of big news for 2015 , he thinks what he calls ‘ @entity236 ’ ( similar to the ‘ @entity238 ’ look ) , will be big news			0
' it ’s just about creating shorter , sharper detailed silhouettes when putting the hair up , ' he said			0
@entity159 , who says he aims to create products with personality and a comfortable salon where egos are left at the door , added : ‘ working with @entity7 is such a pleasure			1
she is never afraid to try new things and it ’s a real collaborative partnership			0
’ ' my favourite thing about working with @entity7 is that she has fantastic eye to detail			2
plus , @entity7 knows what she likes and what she does n’t , but she ’s fearless when it comes to trying out new styles			2
' despite the show finishing , this is n't the end of @entity7 and @entity159 's creative relationship			1
he revealed : ' i ‘ m looking forward to seeing @entity7 ’s new music video we just shot			0
@entity162 are also in the process of producing some very exciting new products but it ’s a little too early to share yet ! there are some really exciting new looks and projects that i ’m working on for next year which you can stay up to date with on my @entity270 - @ percyhair			0
' now and then : back on 2011 's @entity1 , right , @entity2 described @entity7 's hair as ' the equivalent of five gallons of hair spray and then standing in the middle of a hurricane '			1
she swiftly called in a new style squad to give her today 's look , left			1
