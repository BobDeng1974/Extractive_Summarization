senior @entity1 dems are plotting to sign up to @entity3 ’s pledge for an @entity5 referendum – in exchange for constitutional reforms			1
at least three ministers have privately called for a dramatic shift to back the prime minister ’s plan for an in / out vote on @entity14 ’s place in @entity15 by 2017			1
but in the event of a second coalition with the @entity18 , they would insist on a system of proportional representation in local government elections – and a fresh attempt to replace the @entity23 with an elected @entity24			2
but several of the deputy prime minister ’s senior colleagues believe that embracing a poll will show that the party , which was humiliated in may ’s @entity15 elections , has listened to voters			1
yesterday , as mr @entity28 was raising eyebrows for an inexplicable four changes of outfits during a series of tv and radio interviews , @entity36 president @entity48 said it was important the party does not ‘ give away a referendum lightly ’			2
a @entity36 shift would leave @entity58 as the only major party opposing a poll			0
one expected price demanded by ministers would be to scrap the first - past - the - post voting system in local government elections			0
instead , they want a system of proportional representation called the single transferable vote , under which candidates are ranked			2
the system favours smaller parties – and would also end the effective ‘ one - party rule ’ in many parts of the country			1
the @entity36 also want to revive reform of the @entity23 , which stalled in @entity77 partly thanks to a revolt by conservative mps			0
the @entity36 have been branded ‘ enemies of democracy ’ by @entity81 colleagues after conspiring with @entity58 to kill off legislation guaranteeing plans to hold a vote on @entity14 ’s membership of the @entity5			1
insisting yesterday that he would ‘ relish ’ an @entity5 poll only ‘ when the rules change ’ in @entity41 , mr @entity28 said the @entity18 were ‘ tearing themselves apart ’ and had ‘ plucked an arbitrary date ’ to hold the referendum			1
‘ we do n’t hold referenda every other tuesday in this country , ’ he said			0
in a sign of a split among the @entity36 on how to proceed , @entity99 secretary @entity98 suggested a referendum would not happen unless the @entity81 win next year ’s election outright			0
‘ that would of course require the @entity18 to get a majority after the next election , ’ he told the @entity36 conference in @entity105			0
‘ i do n’t think that ’s going to happen			0

three of @entity28 's senior colleagues want to support @entity26 's @entity5 plan
they want to back his in / out vote on @entity14 ’s place in @entity15 by 2017
they believe position will show fragile @entity1 dems have listened to voters
in exchange they want proportional representation in local elections
system favours smaller parties – and would end effective ‘ one - party rule ’ in many parts of the country
but mr @entity28 is against setting a referendum date - *claiming* the @entity81 are ‘ tearing themselves apart ’ over the issue
