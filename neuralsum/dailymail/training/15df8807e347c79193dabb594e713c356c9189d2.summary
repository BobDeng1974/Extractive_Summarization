@entity1 boss @entity0 is involved in a number of ventures - from electric cars to establishing a colony on @entity6			1
now the eccentric entrepreneur wants to create battery - powered homes			0
during an earning ’s call , mr @entity0 said the firm is going to unveil a @entity1 ‘ home battery ’ - and it should start going into production by the summer			1
@entity0 said his @entity1 firm has designed a ‘ home battery ’ that is expected to go into production by the summer			1
he did n’t reveal how the battery would be used , but it could act as a generator during a power cut it is likely to build on the power packs used in @entity1 ’s range of electric cars such as the @entity24 ‘ we are going to unveil the @entity1 home battery , the consumer battery that would be for use in people ’s houses or businesses fairly soon , ’ mr @entity0 told analysts			1
‘ we have the design done , and it should start going into production in about six months or so			0
’ the @entity35 features the @entity36 , which combines fuel cell technology with hybrid technology			1
the firm said it can serve as a ' high capacity power supply during emergencies '			0
the @entity35 converts the @entity43 power from the @entity45 power socket in the boot to @entity48 power , using an attachment			2
@entity36 calls it a vehicle - to - home system			0
@entity1 's home battery could work in a similar way , or be a standalone battery			1
he did n’t reveal what a home battery would be used for , but it could act as a generator during a power cut , for example			1
as @entity62 pointed out , rival car manufacturer @entity36 already uses a hydrogen fuel cell in its @entity35 car that can be removed and used to power a home			1
according to the @entity68 car maker , the battery can supply electric power to an average home for a week			2
last year , @entity1 unveiled plans for a $ 5billion ‘ @entity72 ’ designed to help the firm ramp up production of batteries for its electric cars , and now homes			1
@entity1 said the factory will cut current battery production costs by up to 30 per cent , and will be powered predominantly by renewable energy sources , such as wind and solar			2
the technology is likely to build on the power packs used in @entity1 ’s range of electric cars such as the @entity24 ‘ we are going to unveil the @entity1 home battery , the consumer battery that would be for use in people ’s houses or businesses fairly soon , ’ mr @entity0 told analysts during yesterday 's earnings call rival car manufacturer @entity36 already uses a hydrogen fuel cell in its @entity35 car ( pictured ) that can be removed and used to power a home			1
according to the @entity68 car maker , the battery can supply electric power to an average home for a week			2
@entity1 's home battery could work in a similar way , or be a standalone battery elsewhere , mr @entity0 is already the chairman of @entity103 - a company that offers solar power systems for homes - and @entity1 's home battery could be an extension of this			1
on the earnings call , @entity1 also announced that during the fourth quarter of last year sales of its @entity24 vehicle fell short of predictions			0
the firm said it shipped a total of 9,834 sedans - 1,136 off the company ’s 11,000 target			0
the man who invented the lithium battery ( pictured ) - which powers almost every portable device on the planet - claims he is working on a super battery the man who invented the lithium battery - which powers almost every portable device on the planet - claims he may have another invention up his sleeve			0
professor @entity130 first demonstrated that lithium cobalt oxide could be used to create a rechargable battery capable of storing energy in 1979 at @entity134			0
now , aged 92 and at the @entity135 , he is working on a new type of ' super battery ' that could change the way we use electricity			0
professor @entity130 instead wants to use pure lithium or sodium metal as the negative electrode			0
this would , in theory , allow batteries to store 60 per cent more energy than current lithium ion batteries			0
that would also mean electric cars - which currently have a maximum range of up to 265 miles on a single charge - could make much longer journeys before needing to be recharged			2
it could also allow new ways to economically store power produced by renewable energy .			0
