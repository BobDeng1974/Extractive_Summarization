by @entity0 published : 18:38 est , 2 december 2012 updated : 03:48 est , 3 december 2012 today is cyber monday , the biggest day of the year for online sales			1
@entity8 up with parking charges , cold weather and the price of petrol , more of us than ever will be @entity10 shopping on the internet			1
i 'm as guilty as anyone - the booze and the fish for my festive dinner this friday will be delivered and i wo n't have to carry a box more than a few feet from the front door			1
it 's convenient to buy your @entity10 stuff online , but is it morally acceptable ? there are two big issues at stake			1
the first is tax avoidance			1
we know that the little people in this country pay a far bigger proportion of their earnings in tax than the rich , and the @entity35 seems disproportionately obsessed with our piddling tax returns , rather than those of huge corporations			1
@entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 have all been summoned to appear before a @entity43 committee to explain why they have paid so little tax in this country , if any at all ... recently , the extent of corporate tax manipulation was laid bare when the bosses of @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 were summoned to appear before a @entity43 committee to explain why they paid so little tax on their profits in this country			1
the figures were shocking - by basing their headquarters overseas , they cleverly avoid paying the same level of tax as @entity57 - based retailers like @entity58			1
these companies call it smart financial planning - i call it morally unacceptable , when they make such a big stink about their ethical values			1
@entity39 has 700 coffee shops in the @entity57 , employing almost 8,500 people			1
they are expanding , planning another 300 stores , and yet their boss told @entity71 ' we are not making money in the @entity57 '			1
in the last three years they paid no corporation tax at all here on sales of £ 1.2 billion			1
outraged customers threatened to boycott the chain and drink their coffee elsewhere , and now @entity39 has announced it is rethinking its ' approach ' to tax and is in talks with @entity85			1
in other words , it 's realised that such blatant manipulation of the system is a pr disaster			2
bosses at tax - paying business @entity58 have called for an overhaul of a tax system littered with loopholes will @entity41 follow suit ? the @entity57 accounts for 45 per cent of its sales in @entity98 , a whopping £ 3.35 billion in 2011 , on which it paid just £ 1.8 million in tax - 2.4 per cent			2
no wonder the boss of @entity58 complains that retailers do not have a level playing field - if 27 per cent of your profits are going straight back to the @entity107 , there 's less to invest in expanding the business			1
@entity109 says he is going to invest more in fighting tax avoidance schemes in his autumn statement this week , but i doubt these companies will suddenly be coughing up millions			2
consumer power is the only way to force change - are you prepared to boycott @entity41 until they pay the same level of tax as @entity58 ? @entity10 shoppers hit up a festively lit @entity121 and keep smaller retailers alive and kicking the second issue is that online shopping is killing off the @entity121			1
every day , 32 shops close - over the whole country , one in seven is boarded up , and in spite of @entity129 ' @entity128 ( funded with a pitiful £ 5.5 million of government money ) , most will never open again			2
@entity131 has reported a 10 per cent drop in profits , and the boss of the @entity136 chain says some of its 400 stores face closure			2
things are grim - but what 's the solution ? the former chief executive of the defunct diy chain @entity144 says old - style shopping centres have had their day , and the government must focus on leisure - cafes , restaurants , galleries and advice centres - and not saving stores			2
as consumers , we can save our @entity154 by choosing to use them			2
instead , we stay at home , click a mouse , and there 's no denying that 's very convenient			2
retailers want the chancellor to freeze business rates , and small - shop owners in trendy towns like @entity165 , @entity166 , want landlords to delay rent increases			1
i have some sympathy , but in the end , it 's the consumers who control their destiny , and all the signs are that we 've fallen out of love with popping out to the shops			2
i want town centres to come alive again , but we ca n't turn back the clock			0
online purchasing is here to stay , but remember , every time you click that mouse for @entity41 , you are increasing the profits of a company that treats our tax system with contempt			1
choose companies who are prepared to play by the rules			1
odd nosh for @entity190 @entity191 says he 's taken cooking lessons and plans to open a restaurant with his pal @entity195			0
let 's just hope @entity190 is not allowed any input into the menu			0
recently , she told her followers on @entity200 she was living on a diet of kale , ' sprinkled with a little salt and roasted '			0
@entity191 says he 's taken cooking lessons and plans to open a restaurant with his pal @entity195			0
@entity207 is renowned for her fondness for dieting fads and living off low calorie foods such as prawns let 's just hope @entity190 is not allowed any input into the menu			0
recently , she told her followers on @entity200 she was living on a diet of kale , ' sprinkled with a little salt and roasted '			0
i grow this nutritious green vegetable , but why you would shove it in a hot oven when it tastes delicious shredded and stir - fried or steamed is beyond me			0
but @entity207 's bizarre food fads are well - documented - for years she lived on a simple diet of a few leaves of rocket and prawns			0
you do n't get those stick - like arms by eating carbs ! is this the world 's most expensive bra ? last week , @entity237 's auction house in @entity238 sold two of the iconic outfits that were designed by @entity241 for @entity243 's blonde ambition tour in the 1990s			0
@entity243 showing off that iconic bra on her @entity245 the outrageous sequined and beaded conical bras and bustiers worn on the tour created an instantly recognisable cartoon - character image for @entity243 that has lived on ever since - but what kind of person pays £ 48,700 for two well - worn bits of underwear ? please do n't write in to tell me ! it 's getting awfully amorous in @entity256 have the writers of the @entity258 finally acknowledged that the lusty @entity259 could be their female audience 's guilty pleasure ? last week , listeners were treated to two bouts of bonking in @entity265 in as many days ! recently , the soap has been mired in worthy dreariness - ed and @entity271 's money problems , @entity268 's feeble attempts as a local journalist , and @entity274 's never - ending pregnancy			0
now , @entity275 has spent the night with @entity276 , after months of dithering , and @entity278 took herself to @entity279 for a spot of hotel nookie with @entity283 's brother @entity282			0
after finishing their frolics , my radio started emitting a gasping and groaning			0
i could n't believe this middle - aged couple would be able to manage three times in less than an hour … but the heavy breathing turned out to be @entity274 and @entity293 practising birthing exercises			0
ugh ! new government issue @entity297 cigarette packets smokers left fuming over punchy new packaging proof that packaging is all - important - from the this month , @entity297 smokers have to purchase their cigarettes in plain olive green packets , which are covered in prominent warnings like : ' smoking causes blindness '			0
the new packets also carry distressing pictures of terminally ill cancer sufferers , diseased feet , malformed eyeballs and sick babies , all designed to hammer home the message that puffing on the contents of the packet will seriously damage your health			0
already , angry consumers have been calling advice groups claiming that the repackaged cigarettes have been doctored to ' taste different			0
' the manufacturers insist that is not the case , but smokers remain unconvinced			0
the government is considering adopting the same tactics here - would it work for booze as well as tobacco ?			0

*coinciding* with ' cyber monday ' , @entity0 urges @entity10 shoppers to hit the high street instead of buying online but if *absolutely* necessary , choose internet retailers with great care !
