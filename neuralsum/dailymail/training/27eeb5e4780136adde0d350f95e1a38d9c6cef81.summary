@entity0 completed a £ 27million deal for @entity2 on transfer deadline day in a move that sat @entity6 head back to @entity7 and @entity8			1
@entity9 star @entity2 , 26 , will cost the @entity10 an initial £ 23.3million which will rise to £ 26.8m with bonuses			1
here 's 10 things you need to know about @entity15 's new recruit			0
@entity16 winger @entity2 sealed a £ 27million switch to @entity0 from @entity9 @entity0 sold @entity7 @entity6 to free up the funds to buy @entity19 1			1
watch out @entity20 the first question on @entity0 fans ' minds will be where will @entity19 fit into the team ? realistically , the @entity16 has quite a fight on his hands given the way @entity15 's side have been performing this season			1
after all , they are five points clear in the @entity34 and reached the final of the @entity36 after beating @entity37 on tuesday night			0
@entity15 has a well - established and highly - effective 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 system and @entity19 is most likely to feature on the right - hand side of the trident that plays behind @entity41			1
so it 's @entity20 that is looking over his shoulder with alarm			2
the @entity46 has featured in 31 matches for @entity0 this season , scoring three times and contributing three assists			1
it 's not a spectacular record and @entity15 wo n't be shy in pairing his new signing with the much more in - form @entity56 and @entity55			0
@entity19 is expected to challenge @entity20 for his place on the right - side of @entity0 's midfield @entity15 will likely team @entity19 with @entity56 and @entity55 if he retains the same system 2			1
@entity61 to burn the first thing @entity0 fans will notice is the raw pace @entity19 has to offer			1
he will rampage down that right side , leaving defenders for dead with his speed , trickery and athleticism			0
even if he starts on the bench against @entity72 ( assuming all the paperwork can be completed in time ) , @entity19 will generate quite a buzz of excitement around @entity77 when he first collects the ball and zooms off			2
he was given the nickname ' @entity80 ' by his former @entity9 team - mate @entity81 in reference to the ubiquitous scooters that nip in and out of the traffic on @entity86 city streets			2
@entity2 likes to do the same with defenders , nimbly weaving in between them with his close control			2
@entity19 takes off on a run for @entity90 during their @entity92 match with @entity93 last summer 3			1
and work rate to match you always got the impression @entity15 demanded a little bit more from @entity6 in terms of work rate , including the all - important tracking back when @entity0 attacks broke down			1
while @entity19 's primary purpose will be to carry @entity0 forward , he does muck in with the defensive work too and that will be appreciated by @entity105 , manager and fans alike			1
what about his scoring record ? as with all @entity0 's creative players , @entity19 will be expected to chip in with a few goals as well			1
it 's a part of his game that the winger has worked hard on and his scoring rates have improved with every season in @entity86			0
speaking in 2013 , @entity19 revealed how he 'd worked hard at improving this aspect of his game			2
' i spend hours and hours shooting at goal after training , ' he said			0
' who knows how angry the goalkeepers @entity124 and ( @entity126 ) @entity125 are at having to hang back with me before they 're able to hit the showers			0
' @entity19 celebrates after scoring for @entity9 in the @entity129 match with @entity130 this month @entity19 moved to @entity131 from @entity132 , one of the leading clubs in his homeland , in 2010			1
during his youth career , he was actually a striker but did n't really have a good enough scoring record and so the coaches thought his electric pace would be better utilised out wide			1
he failed to find the net in his two seasons with @entity131 before a season - long loan to @entity144 in 2011 - 12 kick - started his career			0
there , he scored three goals in 33 matches to get the ball rolling and since moving to @entity9 , @entity19 has scored 26 times in 106 outings			1
@entity19 celebrates after converting a penalty in @entity90 's win over @entity154 at the @entity92 5			1
what about setting up goals for others ? again , this is an area that has improved with age for @entity19 , whose crossing and passing in the final third has become more assured and incisive			2
at the @entity92 last summer , @entity19 finished joint - top of the tournament 's assist chart with @entity7 's @entity167 on four apiece			1
@entity167 , however , played in two matches more			0
two of @entity19 's came as @entity170 were swept aside 3 - 0 in @entity90 's opening group match and he also scored a penalty in the third group game , a 4 - 1 win over @entity154			1
and in the last - 16 clash with @entity93 , after @entity175 had scored his award - winning volley , @entity19 soared into the air to cushion a very high cross down for the top scorer to grab a crucial second			2
for @entity9 , he registered 11 assists last season and has three so far this term			1
yet another choreographed dance routine involving @entity19 - this time for @entity9 6			1
he knows how to celebrate in style most people will remember @entity2 from the vibrant @entity90 side that reached the quarter - finals of the @entity92 last year			1
though @entity175 was the undoubted star in @entity193 's team , @entity19 played an integral part as his assist record testifies			2
the @entity16 celebrations also stick in the memory - those colourful , choreographed dance routines that even involved the substitutes on the touchline			2
perhaps we 'll see @entity0 inventing their own signature moves soon			2
@entity19 does enjoy a backflip too , so stand clear ! the winger celebrates in typically flamboyant fashion after scoring for @entity9 against @entity206 7			1
he 's a tough cookie one of the things @entity15 and @entity0 fans need to be reassured about is whether @entity19 can cope with the robust and physical nature of the @entity212 game			1
the evidence so far suggests that he 's pretty resilient			0
@entity19 has consistently been one of the most fouled players in @entity217 , unsurprising given that defenders do n't take too kindly to being made to look like fools			2
but his athleticism means he can withstand most challenges and his injury history is very encouraging			0
he missed five games for @entity9 in september 2013 but that 's about it			0
his early years were far from easy @entity19 was born in the coastal town of @entity226 , which is one of the oldest settlements in @entity90 , though he was raised further south in the city of @entity230			1
his father , @entity231 , a truck driver , was shot dead when he was just five years old			0
speaking on a @entity16 interview show , his mother @entity232 said he had to be the perfect student in order to play football			0
playing as a forward , @entity19 started out at @entity238 but on the recommendation of the club 's founder @entity240 , he was moved to the wing			0
after a brief spell at second division side @entity244 , where he mostly languished on the bench , he was signed by @entity132 , one of the country 's biggest clubs , in 2008			0
@entity19 scored on his debut against @entity251 and the wheels were soon in motion			0
@entity19 holds off the challenge of @entity46 's @entity255 in the @entity92 quarter - final in @entity257 9			1
@entity86 jobs @entity19 only actually spent one season at @entity132			0
he attracted interest from @entity86 clubs and joined @entity131 on a five - year contract in july 2009			0
opportunities were initially limited for the then - 21 - year - old , who made just 12 appearances in his first season and the same number in his second , failing to score a goal in either			0
a change of scenery was probably a good idea and he was sent out to fellow @entity217 side @entity144 for the 2011 - 12 campaign			0
with more regular football , @entity19 started to show his talents , scoring three goals and setting up two more in a season of 33 league appearances			0
it was n't enough to keep @entity144 in the top flight but his performances did catch the eye of @entity9			0
they paid £ 4.5m for a 50 per cent ownership stake in @entity19			2
@entity19 in action for @entity144 during his loan spell at the @entity217 club from @entity131 in his first season at the @entity293 , he opened his account in a 4 - 1 win over @entity296 and finished the season with five goals and seven assists as the @entity300 finished fourth			2
but 2013 - 14 was his breakthrough season , with a string of impressive performances leading to 15 goals and 11 assists in all competitions			0
the most important came against his former club @entity131 in the semi-final , second leg of the @entity129 , securing a 3 - 2 aggregate success and a place in the final against @entity313 ( which they lost 3 - 1 )			0
the winger became a popular figure at @entity144 for his dance celebrations with team - mate @entity318 10			0
international honours @entity19 earned his first international call - up for @entity90 a year after his transfer to @entity131 , playing and scoring against @entity323 in september 2010			1
since then , he has been a regular in the side , with 37 caps and five goals to his name .			0

@entity2 sealed £ 27m switch from @entity9 to @entity0
the @entity10 will sell @entity6 to gain funds to buy @entity16
@entity19 , 26 , plays on the right of midfield and will challenge @entity20
electric pace and trickery is his main asset , plus strong work ethic
impressed for @entity90 at the @entity92 , claiming four assists
