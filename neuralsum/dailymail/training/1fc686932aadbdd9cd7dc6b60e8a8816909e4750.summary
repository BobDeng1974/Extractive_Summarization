by @entity0 people have used a mouse to control their computers ever since the machines became mainstream enough to invade the home			0
but now there is a new batch of hands - free technology that claims to be more intuitive , accurate than fun than the handy hardware , which was invented around 70 years ago			2
a start - up called @entity12 , based in @entity13 , @entity14 in @entity15 , is about to release a smart armband that lets people control their computers by using hand gestures			1
the @entity19 ( pictured ) lets people control their computers by using hand gestures - some of which are pre-set and others which will evolve over time software : thin design housing an @entity27 processor and haptic feedback communication : @entity31 4.0 low energy sensors : proprietary @entity35 muscle activity sensors , and a three axis gyroscope , accelerometer and magnetometer power : @entity40 charging : rechargeable lithium ion battery weight : 95grams colours : black and white shipping date : september 2014 cost : $ 149 ( £ 87 ) the @entity19 band can do this because it contains sensors that measure the motion and electrical activity in the wearer ’s arm muscles			1
from this information , it can interpret certain hand gestures as well as movements to execute the relevant instructions on a computer screen			1
this is different to some competing controllers , such as @entity61 ’s @entity60 , which relies on a camera to monitor someone ’s movements			0
a final version of the $ 149 ( £ 87 plus shipping ) device is set to be released in september and its makers claim it will work with @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity73 devices			1
the armband ( pictured ) lets people control their computer by using pre-set hand gestures the armband can do this because it contains sensors that measure the motion and electrical activity in the wearer 's arm muscles ( illustrated ) it connects with compatible computers and tablets via a @entity88 connection			1
the device contains a @entity91 battery , which can be recharged so that it can be used for a few days			2
weighing in at around the same as a chunky wristwatch , the device is designed to fit almost any arm because it can be worn in different ways , as long as it is positioned on the upper forearm			1
‘ our team has put countless hours into creating the sleek design , as well as the technology inside of it , ’ said @entity98 , ceo and co-founder of @entity12			0
‘ this final design is rugged , while also being lightweight , making it easy for the @entity19 armband to become a part of our everyday lives			1
’ the team of engineers who created the device have pre-set some gestures for users to learn , but these will be added to by developers			2
the firm says that with time , a number of apps will also be available after launch			0
it could be adapted to control tvs and radio - controlled cars , giving people a break from hunting for mislaid remote controls			0
a final version of the $ 149 ( £ 87 plus shipping ) device ( pictured ) is set to be released in september and its makers claim it will work with @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity73 devices the computer mouse has had a good run , but almost 70 years since the design was first patented , it is now under threat from a smart ‘ thimble ’			1
the wearable @entity141 device is fitted with an accelerometer and gyroscope , and lets people control an onscreen mouse using just a wave of their finger			0
the device , created by engineers at the @entity150 , uses a 3d accelerometer , magnetometer and gyroscope to orientate where the pointer should be			0
the ' thimble ' also uses optical flow sensors to track movement against a @entity159 surface			0
a button between the forefinger and thumb is used in place of the left - click button on a standard mouse			0
all of this location data is streamed to a laptop and is used to move the cursor , it can also be used with touchscreen - style gestures such as double tap and long press			2
by combining data from all of the sensors , the @entity173 can more accurately determine the location on the screen , and the researchers claim it can be used to move a 3d object with a positioning error of only about 1 mm.			2

a start - up based in @entity13 , @entity14 in @entity15 , is set to release its smart armband in september
it uses sensors to read electrical activity in a wearer 's arm muscles
the @entity19 armband can interpret certain hand gestures and execute the relevant instructions on the computer screen
the device will work with @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity73 devices
it can be *pre-ordered* for $ 149 ( £ 87 )
