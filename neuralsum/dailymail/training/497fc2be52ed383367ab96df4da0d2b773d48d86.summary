by @entity0 as rock music ’s greatest sex symbol over 50 years , @entity1 has always been notorious for his treatment of his wives and girlfriends , as distinct from those @entity8 groupies he bedded by the thousand			1
though suicide attempts have been a constant motif in @entity1 ’s prodigious love life , until now his relationships seemed to have left few scars on him			1
his first serious girlfriend was @entity15 , the younger sister of @entity17 supermodel @entity16 , whom he met when he was 19 and a student at the @entity20			1
he dumped her for @entity26 ( right ) happier days : @entity1 and @entity26 are pictured together in 1967 at first , he was besotted and they planned to marry			1
but @entity1 ’s growing stardom — and notoriety — created an increasing gulf between them			1
in 1966 , he brutally dumped her for convent - educated pop singer @entity26			1
alone in their @entity35 flat , the distraught @entity15 took an overdose of sleeping pills			1
@entity1 found her just in time but , to avoid media publicity , his management had @entity15 taken to hospital in a plain van , checked in under a false name and then , in a private clinic , she was sedated and held a virtual prisoner until her parents reclaimed her			1
in those days , before palimony agreements , @entity1 walked away without giving her a penny			1
years later , when it was ( mistakenly ) reported she intended to sell some of his love letters , the ever - controlling @entity1 threatened her with legal action unless she sent them back			1
@entity1 and @entity54 pictured together on their wedding day in 1971 at the @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity59			2
they divorced in 1979 and so , @entity26 , the daughter of an @entity62 baroness , became his muse , introducing the gauche young rocker to literature , ballet and opera			1
she also achieved infamy when @entity1 and fellow @entity70 @entity69 were busted for drug possession and briefly imprisoned in 1967			2
she was found by police seated next to @entity1 wearing nothing but a fur rug			2
not surprisingly , life with a super-vain superstar was no easier on @entity26			1
in 1969 , while with @entity1 in @entity77 , she swallowed 50 sleeping tablets , washing them down with hot chocolate			2
@entity1 married @entity81 supermodel @entity80 in 1990 and the couple had four children together before divorcing in 1999 @entity1 found her just in time , as he had @entity15			1
but for @entity26 , it was the start of a downward spiral into heavy drug use and alcoholism			1
after leaving @entity1 , she was penniless , became a heroin addict and lived rough in @entity89			2
next up was the @entity91 - born @entity54 , who became his first wife , though she later would say bitterly that her marriage ‘ ended ’ on her wedding day			2
indeed , on the morning of their 1971 wedding in @entity58 in the @entity97 , before the world ’s media , @entity1 made a scene because @entity54 refused to sign a pre-nuptial agreement			2
thereafter , she felt herself to be little more than another member of his permanent court of gophers and sycophants , whom she nicknamed ‘ the @entity109 state ’			0
the marriage was effectively over after a year , though the couple stayed together for the sake of their daughter , @entity113			0
when @entity54 finally divorced @entity1 in 1979 , smart work by his lawyers kept her settlement at only around £ 1 million			0
@entity54 ’s replacement , the @entity81 supermodel @entity80 — whom @entity1 stole from fellow pop idol @entity120 — at first seemed successful at bringing @entity121 to heel			0
not only did she have money of her own , meaning his precious fortune was safe , but she turned a blind eye to the affairs with much younger women that the priapic @entity1 continued to have into middle age			0
@entity80 was desperate to marry , even packing a wedding dress in hope every time she went on a @entity8 tour			1
@entity80 had four children with @entity1 - and managed to walk away from their marriage with a $ 7.4million settlement but it was not until she ’d borne him two children that he relented and agreed to marry her in a @entity142 woodcarver ’s hut in 1990			0
yet the old devil ’s infidelities still continued , including a rumoured affair with the future @entity59 first lady , @entity146			0
the breaking point with @entity80 was his affair with the @entity150 model @entity149 , which resulted in a son , @entity152			0
when @entity80 sued for divorce , having by then had four children by @entity1 , he crassly claimed their @entity142 wedding was legally invalid , and so the marriage was annulled ‘ by mutual agreement ’			0
@entity1 is reported to be ' devastated ' at losing @entity157			0
they were together for 13 years @entity80 ’s rumoured settlement of £ 4.5 million made her the first @entity1 ex to describe him as ‘ very , very generous ’			0
with @entity157 , he was thought to have found someone with whom to grow old comfortably			0
she was wealthy , independent and did n’t demand commitment			0
yet even after all their years together , @entity1 , the perpetual adolescent , still referred to her only as ‘ someone i ’m sort of seeing ’			0
now , though , he is reported to be ‘ devastated ’ at losing her			0
that emotion will be one that the serial heart - breaker has never experienced before .			0
