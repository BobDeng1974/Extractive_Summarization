the president of @entity9 has so much confidence in the toughness of the @entity14 manufacturer 's vehicles that he appeared in a video standing on the new @entity17 model as it dangles 65ft above the sea from a crane			1
' well , i have to admit i had butterflies in my tummy and i certainly did wonder more than once about what i 'd let myself in for			1
i 'm no mountain - climber and i do n't like heights , ' he said			2
' he had to spend almost two hours standing on the front panel of a @entity17 construction truck that had been hoisted high above the water in @entity42 harbour in @entity14			2
the stunt was undertaken to show that the truck 's front towing hook can handle far greater stresses than those to which it is normally subjected			1
incredibly there was not trick filming or special effects , just mr @entity7 standing atop the suspended truck			1
the film was shot from a helicopter			2
everything had been prepared in advance down to the tiniest detail			0
the stunt was undertaken to show that the truck 's front towing hook can handle far greater stresses than those to which it is normally subjected no @entity65 trickery or filming tricks were used in the creation of the incredible film ' the difficulty is to shoot the entire film in one take from a helicopter , ' says @entity73 of @entity74 , who directed the viral ' ' i 'm really impressed by @entity7 , who stayed cool and focused throughout the two hours while hanging 20 metres up in the air			1
i tried it myself , but just for 15 minutes			0
' it was pretty scary i can tell you			0
' this is not the first time @entity9 has filmed spectacular tests featuring their trucks			0
' @entity85 ' saw tightrope walker @entity87 balance on a slackline between two trucks driving at full speed			0
