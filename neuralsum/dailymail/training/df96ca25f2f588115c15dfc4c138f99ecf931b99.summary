the higher a country 's chocolate consumption , the more @entity2 laureates it spawns , new research suggests does eating chocolate make you clever ? it seems that might well be the case after scientists in @entity10 found the higher a country 's chocolate consumption , the more @entity2 laureates it spawns			1
the new research , published in the @entity14 , is tongue - in - cheek , admits the lead author dr. @entity16			1
but nonetheless , the results did show a surprisingly powerful scientific correlation between the amount of chocolate consumed in each country and the number of @entity2 laureates it produced , he wrote in the journal			2
the @entity25 , naturally , take the lead , with the @entity27 and @entity28 following closely behind			1
the @entity29 was above average in the table ( see below )			0
dr @entity16 , a @entity25 doctor now working at @entity33 in @entity10 , told @entity34 : ‘ i started plotting this in a hotel room , because i had nothing else to do , and i could not believe my eyes			0
' all the countries lined up neatly on a graph , with higher chocolate intake tied to more laureates			0
' it ’s thought that eating chocolate might improve our ability to think as it is high in antioxidants known as flavonoids , which are also found in cocoa , green tea , red wine and some fruits			0
studies have suggested that flavonoids may improve thinking and reduce the risk of dementia by increasing the blood flow to the brain			0
dr @entity16 wrote in the journal : ‘ since chocolate consumption has been documented to improve cognitive function , it seems most likely that in a dose - dependent way , chocolate intake provides the abundant fertile ground needed for the sprouting of @entity2 laureates			1
’ the @entity25 , naturally , take the lead , with the @entity27 and @entity28 following closely behind			1
the @entity29 was above average in the table when it comes to chocolate , several other researchers have suggested dark varieties might benefit the brain , the heart and even help cut excess pounds			2
but to produce just one more laureate , the nation would have to up its cocoa intake by a whopping 275 million pounds a year , dr @entity16 added			0
he estimates that every citizen would have to eat 400 grams of chocolate a year to increase the number of @entity2 laureates in a given country by one per million inhabitants , if the correlation holds true			2
and in the ' conflict of interest section ' of his article , dr @entity16 does admit to daily chocolate consumption			0
despite the tongue - in - cheek tone of the research , he added that he does believe chocolate has real health effects , although he warns people to stay away from the sweeter varieties and opt for dark .			1

@entity97 research suggests the higher a country 's chocolate consumption , the more @entity2 laureates it spawns
the @entity25 take the lead , with the @entity27 and @entity28 following closely behind . the @entity29 was above average
researcher admits research is tongue - in - cheek , but maintains findings are scientifically sound
