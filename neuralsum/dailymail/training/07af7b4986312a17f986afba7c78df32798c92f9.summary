@entity1 - shot injection pumps filler into women 's g spot increases g spot to size of 10p coin takes just thirty minutes more than 2,000 women have undergone the procedure in five years it is a sexual quest that has frustrated couples for decades and as a result many people do n't even believe that the @entity15 exists			1
but now help is at hand and the sex lives of couples worldwide could be enhanced dramatically thanks to a single jab			0
the ' @entity21 ' injection is a surgical procedure which claims to improve women 's sex lives by pumping filler into her g spot			1
the @entity21 could help improve the sex lives of couples worldwide as more than 2,000 women have rushed to experience the latest procedure in @entity29 the collagen jab , which will set you back £ 800 , temporarily increases the g - spot 's size to that of a 10p coin			1
the ' lunchtime ' procedure involves an injection given under local anesthetic and can be completed in just half an hour			1
the injection pumps collagen into a women 's @entity15 and can be completed in just half an hour it is certainly proving a hit in @entity44 where women are rushing to the @entity46 for their fix			1
gynaecologist and surgeon dr @entity48 who works at the clinic even organises monthly sessions where women tempted by the @entity54 shot can come down and discuss the procedure			1
' i want to empower and educate , and for women to be in tune with themselves			2
' why is it so difficult to accept ? because it 's not something like your nose that you can point to that you can see or feel , ' explained dr @entity48 in an interview with fabulous magazine			2
more than 2,000 women have undergone the procedure at his clinic since it launched five years ago			1
and although women have been flying over to the states to experience the latest treatment , it is also increasingly becoming available in the @entity74			2
@entity75 , @entity76 at the @entity77 was one of the first female gynaecologists on this side of the pond to offer the jab			0
the £ 800 treatment has so far been ' relatively popular ' and is carried out in a @entity84 clinic where the emphasis is on comfort			0
in 2008 @entity87 sat her partner @entity88 down and asked him a simple question			0
@entity87 really rates the treatment if , she said , i could be guaranteed an orgasm every time we had sex , what would be your reaction ? not that surprisingly , her partner @entity88 , 27 , a plasterer , replied that he 'd be delighted			0
' so i told him i wanted to have a brand - new treatment which would enable me to do just that - and also make my orgasms much more intense than normal , ' says @entity87			2
' his jaw literally hit the floor and he said , " sounds good to me			0
" ' and so , @entity87 became the first @entity74 woman to have the ' g - shot ' , also known as the ' orgasm jab '			1
and , as @entity87 can testify , the results were tremendous			0
' i have quite literally never experienced anything quite like it , ' she says			0
' i had constant multiple orgasms which went on for hours			0
' that first time , the whole thing was so intense i was actually a bit scared			0
i was so overcome , but thankfully the intensity is something i 've got used to			0
i still have multiple orgasms every time i have sex , but they no longer leave me flat on my back			0
' although @entity87 , a 41 - year - old business developer from @entity122 who has no children , says she 's always enjoyed a healthy sex life , it was n't until a few years ago that she first discovered her g - spot			1
she says : ' i personally thought anyone who said they climaxed through intercourse alone was lying			0
and i did n't really believe in the g - spot			1
' but a few years ago , my partner at the time said he wanted to find it			2
we actually set aside an entire afternoon and spent hours searching for my g - spot			1
' ' finding the damned thing in the first place was no easy feat and was n't exactly the most erotic of experiences , but we got there in the end			0
i still think that women who claim they can find their g - spot during a one - night stand are lying			1
once we 'd found my g - spot , my sex life did improve , but i still did n't orgasm every time we had sex			1
' to be honest , even when you know where it is , the g - spot can still be incredibly elusive			1
i found it very frustrating			0
' the g - spot is supposed to be an area just a few centimetres across on the back vaginal wall @entity87 heard about the arrival of the g - shot in the @entity74 from @entity158 , where the procedure has been available for some years			1
she discovered that professor @entity160 , of the @entity74 @entity161 in @entity162 's @entity84 , was the @entity74 's only cosmetic gynaecologist approved to administer the shot			1
' i was reading these flyers which detailed the g - shot , ' says @entity87			1
' i immediately thought i had to get it done			0
' i attended a consultation , where professor @entity160 explained that injecting collagen into my normal , pea - sized g - spot would enlarge it for up to four months			1
the results would mean longer , more intense orgasms			0
' he showed me a diagram of exactly where the g - spot is - between 5.8 to 6.2cm from the pubic bone			1
it all sounded pretty straightforward			0
' the procedure itself was a bit nerve - racking , though			1
' at one point , professor @entity160 was trying to locate my g - spot with one hand while holding an 8cm needle filled with collagen in the other			2
' i lay on my back thinking : " oh @entity188 , what am i doing here ? " it did n't hurt and professor @entity160 was very professional about it , but i ca n't say i was n't embarrassed			0
' five minutes later though , i was up and dressed , and to my surprise feeling vaguely aroused , but i think that was more because of the anticipation of the sex that i 'd have later			2
' @entity87 was told she had to wait four hours before having sex , and so spent the afternoon shopping			0
' when we did have sex i 'm happy to report it was just unbelievable - and it 's been the same every time since			2
' @entity87 was so happy with the results that she immediately booked in to have a top - up treatment four months later and says she 'll carry on having the jab indefinitely			2
' i 'll treat it in the same way as i do getting my hair cut or my highlights done , ' she says			0
' @entity88 and i always had a healthy sex life , but now it 's better than ever			2
