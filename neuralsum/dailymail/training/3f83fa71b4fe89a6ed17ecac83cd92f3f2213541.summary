by @entity0 published : 04:48 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 20:40 est , 2 march 2014 teenagers would be made to study maths and @entity5 until the age of 18 under a @entity8 government , the party has revealed			0
in a bid to drive up standards , it would become compulsory for pupils in @entity5 and @entity13 to keep up the subjects , even if they leave school at 16			1
but education leaders have already warned that the plan , supported by shadow education secretary @entity18 , would require training many more teachers			1
@entity21 education secretary @entity18 ( left ) supports the move but @entity23 ( right ) , who leads the @entity24 , warned the plan would require investment the announcement from @entity8 , expected to be confirmed in a major paper on education tomorrow , comes as part of new plans for a ' national baccalaureate ' designed to help young people into work			1
their proposal is part of a set of reforms which aims to reduce the number of people who are not in education , employment or training , ( @entity45 ) as well as meet the demands of businesses , which consistently complain of low standards in literacy and numeracy			2
according to @entity8 , around one million young people are currently @entity45 because careers advice and guidance is inadequate			0
the new education plan will apply both to students who stay at school to pursue a-levels and to those who leave for apprenticeships			1
but education leaders were quick to point out the practical problems with increasing the amount of teaching , and demanding further study when many pupils still fail to reach required standards at gcse level			1
@entity23 , the chief executive of the @entity24 , told the @entity67 : ' in principle asking everyone to do maths and @entity5 to the age of 18 is a good idea			1
' however , such a commitment would require many more specialist teachers to be recruited and trained			1
there is also a huge challenge to ensure that half of young people achieve grade a to @entity80 in gcse maths , let alone the next level			0
' further study : new @entity8 proposals outline plans to make @entity5 and maths compulsory in some form until age 18 organisations offering training or apprenticeships would have to ensure that further maths and @entity5 study featured in their programmes , forming a so - called ' technical baccalaureate '			2
schools would also be pressured to make sure that pupils who leave aged 16 move to apprenticeships or another form of training - rather than regular employment or the dole - or face losing funding			1
under the proposals , if too many youngsters leave school but do not continue learning , schools could be fined and the money given to careers advice organisation			1
@entity8 's plan follows an announcement from education secretary @entity111 that teenagers who fail to achieve c grades in maths of @entity115 would have to keep studying them beyond sixteen			0
however , its proposals are further - reaching , and have been described by shadow education secretary @entity18 as a way to reach out to the ' forgotten 50 per cent ' of teenagers who do not go to unviersity			2
mr @entity18 today said : ' reforms must focus on driving up standards in maths and @entity5 , strengthening character and resilience and equipping the labour market of the future with the skills set it needs			2
more of the same just wo n't do			0
' professor @entity128 , who chairs the group which made the proposals , said : ' in @entity132 , we have a poor record of delivering high skills and effective qualifications for the forgotten 50 per cent : the half of young people for whom the current qualifications regime simply does not deliver			0
' what we have set out is do - able and practical			0
our economic and our social future depends on getting this right			0
' @entity142 , a spokesman for business lobbying group the @entity143 said : ' this is an important contribution to building a more effective education system between 14 and 19			0
businesses will welcome the focus			0

bid to drive up standards would see *additional* focus on key subjects
proposals would even apply to youngsters who leave school at 16
but @entity24 leader @entity23 warned of *difficulties*
he said plans would require many more specialist teachers
added that many pupils fall short of standards expected aged 16
