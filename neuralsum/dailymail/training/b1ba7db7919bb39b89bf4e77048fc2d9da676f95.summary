a fresh leak of highly radioactive water from the @entity3 nuclear plant into the @entity4 has been detected today			1
sensors detected contamination levels up to 70 times greater than the already - high radioactive status seen at the plant campus , @entity5 ( @entity5 ) announced this morning			1
@entity5 said its emergency inspections of tanks storing nuclear waste water did not find any additional abnormalities , but the firm said it shut the gutter to prevent radioactive water from going into the @entity4			1
dangerous leak : a member of the @entity19 mission team inspects @entity5 's @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity3 prefecture , earlier this month the contamination detected early this morning by sensors rigged to a gutter that pours rain and ground water at the @entity20 plant to a nearby bay showed radiation levels 50 to 70 times greater than usual , @entity5 said			1
though levels have steadily fallen throughout the day , the same sensors were still showing contamination about 10 to 20 times more than usual , a company spokesman said			2
it was not immediately clear what caused the original spike of the contamination and its gradual fall , he added			0
' with emergency surveys of the plant and monitoring of other sensors , we have no reason to believe tanks storing radioactive waste water have leaked , ' the unnamed spokesman said			0
' we have shut the gutter ( from pouring water to the bay )			0
we are currently monitoring the sensors at the gutter and seeing the trend , ' he said			0
big risk : @entity3 sensors detected contamination levels up to 70 times greater than the already - high radioactive status seen at the plant campus ( stock image ) destruction : the @entity20 after the massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami on march 14 , 2011 in @entity64 , @entity65 the latest incident , one of several that have plagued the plant in recent months , reflects the difficulty in controlling and decommissioning the plant , which went through meltdowns and explosions after being battered by a giant tsunami in march 2011 , sparking the world 's worst nuclear disaster in a generation			1
@entity5 has not been able to effectively deal with an increasing amount of contaminated water , used to cool the crippled reactors and molten fuels inside them and kept in large storage tanks on the plant 's vast campus			0
adding to @entity5 's headaches has been the persistent flow of groundwater from nearby mountains travelling under the contaminated plant before washing to the @entity4			0
the @entity19 recently said @entity5 has made ' significant progress ' in cleaning up the plant , but suggested that @entity65 should consider ways to discharge treated waste water into the sea as a relatively safer way to deal with the radioactive water crisis .			2

leak of highly radioactive water from @entity3 into the @entity4
contamination levels 50 - 70 times greater than the already - high status
gutter from plant to the sea has since been shut and levels have dropped
