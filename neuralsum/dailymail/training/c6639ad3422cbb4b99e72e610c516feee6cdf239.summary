by @entity1 reporter published : 09:53 est , 21 august 2013 updated : 05:41 est , 18 september 2013 guilty : @entity2 , pictured here on june 17 , was convicted tuesday of murdering four women between the 1970s and 1990s , all of whose first and last names began with the same letters a former photographer was convicted tuesday of murdering four young @entity10 women decades ago after a two - month trial in which prosecutors called him a remorseless serial killer who preyed on young prostitutes			1
jurors deliberated for about eight hours over two days in @entity17 before finding @entity2 , 79 , guilty of slaying the four women with alliterative names : @entity20 in 1977 , @entity21 in 1978 , @entity22 in 1993 and @entity23 in 1994			1
the so - called @entity24 , so named because his victims ' first and last names all began with the same letter , did not visibly react when his damning verdict was read			1
the jury of six men and six women will reconvene sept. 4 to determine if @entity2 gets the death penalty			1
all the victims were found dumped in rural @entity10 locations			0
@entity20 's body was found in @entity37 and was the reason @entity2 's trial was held in the historical @entity40 designed by noted architect @entity41			1
@entity42 was found in @entity43 and the other two victims in @entity45			0
@entity2 was arrested in 2010 after probation officers visiting his @entity49 , @entity48 , home in connection with an unrelated gun conviction discovered numerous photographs of nude women posed in unnatural positions who appeared dead or unconscious with mannequin parts and lingerie strewn about nearby			1
@entity2 wrote descriptions of rapes and sexual assaults in the journal as far back as the 1950s , @entity37 prosecutor @entity71 said as she read from the journal 's pages			1
@entity2 drugged and photographed his unconscious victims then strangled them and disposed of their naked bodies			1
in entry after entry , @entity2 wrote how he would stalk and approach a woman , offer her a ride home and then ' put it to her ' , often in his car			2
one read : ' girl in north @entity90 woods			0
had to knock her out first			0
' investigators said they also found a ‘ @entity92 ’ that @entity2 had scrawled with descriptions of 10 women , including references prosecutors believe described the four victims he was charged with killing			1
investigators believe @entity2 could be responsible for as many as six more murders and authorities are exploring @entity2 's connections to several unsolved murders			1
the six additional women on the list have not been identified , but authorities continue to investigate any possible connections to @entity2			1
same name : a 10 - year - old was raped and murdered in @entity110 , @entity111 in 1971			0
@entity21 shared a name with one of @entity2 's @entity10 victims but was far younger than his usual prey @entity2 was convicted tuesday of killing four prostitutes -- all with first and last names beginning with the same letters -- in @entity10 between the 1970s and 1990s			1
investigators found ghoulish personal accounts of what he 'd done in a series of journals and lists at his @entity49 , @entity48 home			0
though tried and convicted for only the four crimes , investigators continue to believe @entity2 could be connected to at least six more murders			1
after the @entity110 native 's arrest in 2010 , police briefly fingered him in connection with three other brutal murder cold cases from the @entity136 area where he was born , lived for a time , and would still continue to visit			2
and all three murdered girls had something in common : their first names and last names began with the same letters			1
@entity142 , @entity143 , and @entity21 -- who even had the same name as one of the @entity10 women @entity2 is convicted of killing			1
these were the original @entity148 - initial murders and they rocked the city of @entity110 , @entity111 in the mid 1970s			1
write caption here evidence at @entity2 's home suggests the killer 's victims were n't just in @entity10			1
one entry in his frightening ' list of 10 ' reads ' girl in north @entity90 woods			0
had to knock her out first			0
' but while some clues implicated @entity2 , others seemed to clear him of the crimes			2
though the @entity110 girls indeed had ' double initials , ' they were also quite young			0
each was between the ages of 10 and 12			0
@entity168 's @entity10 victims were all adult prostitutes			2
@entity2 was finally cleared of killing @entity142 , @entity143 , and the @entity169 after @entity170 found on one of the victims did not match his own			1
now , the search continues both for @entity2 's other possible victims and the murderer or murderers of the @entity110 double - initial killer			1
@entity2 acted as his own attorney and told jurors during his closing arguments that he often hired prostitutes to photograph in exotic poses and enjoyed off - beat art. but as he smiled , always wearing a suit and tie , he insisted he was no killer			1
nonetheless , the balding @entity187 , who often seemed befuddled and repeated himself during his rambling closing arguments , struggled to explain away some of the most persuasive evidence against him			0
@entity2 's dna was found on the pantyhose @entity20 was wearing when her body was found			2
his ex-wife 's dna was found on pantyhose wrapped around @entity20 's neck			0
@entity2 told the jury that the evidence only showed he had had sex with @entity20			2
he said there was no proof that he killed her and that prosecutors had no way of knowing who put the pantyhose around her neck			0
execution ? @entity2 , here in another june 17 file photo , will again represent himself for the penalty phase of the trial as he tried to avoid the death penalty unlikely : even if @entity2 bumbles even more as he argues against the death penalty , he 's unlikely to be executed			1
@entity10 's death row list is likely long enough that the 79 - year - old will first die graphic diary entries that detail how @entity2 stalked and raped his victims were read out in court during the closing arguments of his trial			1
@entity2 , 79 , wrote descriptions of rapes and sexual assaults in the journal as far back as the 1950s , @entity37 prosecutor @entity71 said as she read from the journal 's pages			1
the lawyer said they contain accounts of @entity2 approaching women and offering them a ride home			2
after a girl got into his car , @entity2 writes that he would ' put it on her			2
' prosecutors found a ' list of 10 ' girls they say was a roster of the serial killer 's victims			2
the victims coincided with locations , including @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity90 , @entity110 , @entity248 , @entity249 , and even @entity250			0
' outside the front door i overpowered her and ravaged her , ' read one entry set in @entity250 , the @entity251 reported			0
' i could n't help myself			0
' another read : ' girl in north @entity90 woods			0
had to knock her out first			0
' legal analysts said that @entity2 made a mistake representing himself , even if he boasted at one point that ‘ i think i 'm doing quite well ’ during his closing arguments , which consumed all day friday and half of monday			2
‘ he 's bright , ’ said attorney @entity265 , who watched some of the trial			0
‘ but not that bright			0
’ another legal observer agreed			0
@entity269 , a former prosecutor now in private practice , said a good defense attorney would have hired a dna expert to at least try to throw some doubt on how the evidence was gathered , stored and processed to undermine the prosecution 's strongest argument			0
‘ the prosecution did have a challenging case because it happened so long ago , ’ @entity269 said			0
‘ why mr. @entity2 chose to focus on the things he focused on is beyond me			2
i 'm not sure what his plan was			0
’ even if @entity2 is sentenced to death , it is unlikely he will be executed			2
there are 725 inmates already on @entity10 's @entity287 and executions have been on hold since 2006 , when a federal judge ordered an overhaul of @entity10 's execution protocol			0
it will take at least another year for prison officials to properly adopt the state 's new single - drug execution method and have it cleared by the judge			0
sheepish : @entity2 , 79 , smiled often while he represented himself at trial for killing four prostitutes in the 1970s through the 1990s in court : @entity2 is pictured with his public defender in april but eventually represented himself			1
a jury has yet to decide if the 79 - year - old will face the death penalty during his trial , he showed the jury dozens of photographs he took of weddings , landscapes and family members along with what he called ' glamour ' or ' cheesecake ' photographs of nude women			1
he said he never forced any of them to do anything			0
prosecutors , however , claimed he kept a list of his victims and mementos of his crimes			0
closing arguments were delayed briefly as the court investigated a truck bearing the words ' @entity2 killed my sister ' that was parked in the jury lot			2
a district attorney 's inspector and @entity2 's private detective looked into the matter and concluded no contact was made with jurors			2
closing arguments : last week , deputy district attorney @entity71 read from @entity2 's journal that details how he stalked and raped numerous women			1
police believe there were likely more than four @entity343 : the trial was briefly stopped @entity345 wrote the message ' @entity2 murdered my sister ' on the window of a truck in the jury parking lot ' all of them forgotten ' : @entity352 , whose sister @entity20 was killed by @entity2 , said he was the only family member of any of the women to attend the trial			1
