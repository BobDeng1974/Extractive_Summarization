it is the bane of every household – and following a ruling by @entity4 bureaucrats it is about to get worse			1
home owners will find their armoury in the battle against dust and dirt weakened by a ban on powerful vacuum cleaners			1
under @entity15 ‘ eco ’ rules that will come into force next september , the power of new vacuum cleaners must not exceed 1,600 watts			1
under threat : the @entity20 ( left ) , which will be outlawed by new @entity22 regulationsand the @entity23 ( right ) , which outsells its rivals on @entity25 that figure will be lowered further to 900 watts by 2017			1
current cleaners boast an average of 1,800 watts			2
the move angered manufacturers , who say it will do nothing to make cleaners more environmentally friendly and will simply reduce efficiency in the home			0
@entity35 , director of @entity36 , which produces a range of vacuum cleaners , said the regulations would limit performance using ‘ unrealistic criteria ’			1
‘ if the proposed regulations come into force as planned next year , they could hugely frustrate anyone trying to clean their home , ’ he said			1
critics say cleaners satisfying the new rule may use less power , but householders will have to use them for longer so they are likely to use the same amount of electricity in the long run			0
@entity15 president @entity56 says the new rules will save energy equivalent to that produced by four nuclear power stations @entity22 flags outside the @entity15 headquarters in @entity4 here are five of top selling vacuum cleaners on @entity25 that will be banned when new regulations come in 1			1
@entity69 2 @entity70 and @entity71			0
banned by next september under the regulations , appliances will be rated from a to @entity82 depending on how much noise they make , the energy efficiency of their suction and the levels of dust pumped out by their ‘ exhaust air ’			2
similar labels are already displayed on washing machines			0
despite his company not producing any vacuum over 1,400 watts , sir @entity94 , the billionaire entrepreneur who pioneered ‘ bagless ’ vacuums , is also angered by the proposal			2
he says the eco-labels will be misleading because they will not take into account the cost and waste of vacuum bags and filters and will give an advantage to competitors who use ‘ bag ’ technology			2
he is seeking a judicial review of the proposal at the @entity112			0
the new measures will be extended to other appliances , including water pumps , water heaters and tumble dryers			0
the @entity4 bureaucrats have also angered @entity120 farmers with changes to meat labelling			1
meat and poultry is currently labelled with information about where the animal was born , reared and slaughtered			0
but in a proposal to deal with the trade in animals raised in one country and fattened for market in another , they will be required to spend only a few weeks in the @entity36 for the meat to be labelled @entity120			0
@entity36 farmers fear the new rules may trigger imports of cheap chickens from former @entity140 countries .			0

regulations will ban any new machine that exceeds @entity144 next year
that figure will fall to @entity147 by 2017 , according to @entity4 bureaucrats
at present , the average vacuum cleaner has a 1,800w motor
