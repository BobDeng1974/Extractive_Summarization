emergency services were called to the home in @entity8 , @entity9 , following reports of black smoke filling the property			1

a fire was started in the bedroom by the vanity mirror , ruining the cream walls , ceiling and carpet with smoke while the incident was unusual , fire fighters said it was not unheard of for certain mirrors to set fire to fabric by reflecting light			1
@entity35 station officer @entity34 said : ' it ’s not the first time i have been called to a fire which started like this			0
' it ’s not something most people would think about but these magnifying mirrors can create a hot and focused beam of light and in this case it set fire to the curtains			1
' anyone who has one of these mirrors should seriously consider making sure it is kept away from windows and direct sunlight , especially on sunny days like today			0
earlier this year a woman 's vanity mirror burned holes in her curtains when			0
fire fighters noticed the singed rings during a home visit			0
a spokesman from @entity65 said : ' the sun 's rays can be magnified by a lens or magnifying mirror and become focused on a nearby object such as curtains , clothing or even wooden or plastic furniture , fixtures or fittings			0
' this can cause scorching , or charring potentially leading to smouldering or flaming ignition of the object			0
the ceiling in the bedroom and its carpets were destroyed by the smoke which filled the bedroom after the fire ' in the evening , morning and during the winter , when the sun is lower on the horizon , the shallower angle at which the sun 's rays hit the earth means that it is particularly important to be aware of objects , such as magnifying vanity mirrors and glass ornaments , which may be left exposed to direct sunlight			2
' while this type of fire may seem like one of the more unusual cases , in principle it is the same as focussing the sun 's rays with a magnifying glass and , as this case clearly demonstrates , sunlight being focussed by everyday objects can indeed set light to things in the home			2
