@entity0 feels @entity1 were ' crazy ' to change their @entity3 batting line - up at short notice - but still believes they can turn their tournament around			1
the in - form @entity6 was dropped down the order to number six to accommodate @entity10 's return in place of @entity12 for the competition opener against @entity14			1
defeats in that game and against @entity17 - the latter an eight - wicket hammering having been bowled out for 123 - have left @entity21 ' side with an uphill task to make the quarter - finals			2
@entity24 lead his team off the field after their @entity3 defeat to @entity17 @entity21 offers a word of advice to @entity24 during a session in the nets before the @entity33 match and former @entity34 spinner @entity0 told @entity38 @entity37 's @entity36 programme : ' i do n't think the strategy 's been clear			1
every player has n't got a clear and concise role			0
' the @entity44 have been building up to this @entity3 for four years and every player absolutely knows his role - @entity43 said that last night			1
' @entity1 changed their batting line - up the morning of the @entity3 against @entity14 , @entity10 is suddenly brought back in , @entity6 's down to number six , @entity12 taken out of the squad - that was crazy , in my book			1
' it 's muddled , it 's not clear			2
( captain ) @entity24 wants to play a very expressive , aggressive form of cricket ; i 'm not sure @entity21 completely agrees with that and i do n't know how easily that relationship is going to fare			0
' @entity1 batsman @entity6 plays a shot in a training session in the nets on sunday @entity6 was dropped down the order to accommodate @entity10 's return against @entity14 @entity1 's @entity63 plays a shot during a nets session in @entity66 , @entity17 results so far have seen speculation build around @entity21 ' future , even at this early stage of his second spell in charge , but @entity0 is determined to remain positive			1
' they were like rabbits in the headlights against @entity17			0
the disparity was enormous , ' he said			0
' but if they actually play well for the next four games - beat @entity82 heavily , destroy @entity33 - if they do that , all this anger and emotion will disappear			0
if they come out fighting and do well , we 'll all get back on their side			0
' so i 'm not going to jump on the bandwagon and say , ' @entity92 must go if we do n't reach the quarter - finals '			0
i 'm going to be the positive one that says , " in three weeks ' time , we 'll play @entity17 in the semi-final and thrash them by nine wickets "			0
' next up for @entity1 is a clash with @entity33 , who may just fancy their chances considering recent events			2
@entity1 have lost their opening two games of the @entity3 and can not afford to lose on sunday @entity17 's @entity104 tore through @entity1 's batting order , taking 7 - 33 and restricting @entity1 to 123			1

@entity1 have lost both of their @entity3 matches so far
@entity0 said @entity1 's players lack direction at the moment
said they were ' crazy ' to change their batting line - up before the @entity3
