@entity1 president @entity0 yesterday dramatically ordered @entity3 militias to scrap independence referendums planned for sunday and claimed he had pulled his troops back from @entity7 's border			1
the @entity9 leader also said @entity7 's presidential elections , due on may 25 , were a step ' in the right direction '			2
there were immediate suspicions last night that his words amounted to a ploy to temporarily ease @entity18 concerns , offering an olive branch with no substantial change of position			2
' @entity0 has given ground before , only to take it back again			2
this will be a hollow promise to his guest			0
' @entity0 added that the vote would do nothing to ease the crisis engulfing the eastern @entity41 country unless the rights of ' all citizens ' – including @entity1 speakers – were protected			1
@entity7 has repeatedly rejected separatists ' demands for greater autonomy in the south and east amid fears it could lead to the break - up of the nation of 45million			2
shortly before @entity0 's about - turn foreign secretary @entity55 , on a visit to @entity54 , launched a blistering attack on his stance during the conflict			0
but in a blow to hopes of a breakthrough , @entity59 and the @entity60 said there was ' no indication ' the @entity66 had eased tensions by withdrawing the 40,000 troops it had stationed at the frontier			0
some militant leaders vowed to ignore @entity26 's call for referendums in the industrial regions of @entity75 and @entity76 – branded illegal by @entity54 , the @entity77 and @entity78 – to be postponed			0
@entity1 president @entity0 , right , has called on @entity3 separatists in @entity7 to postpone a referendum vote on sunday men carry the coffin of a person killed during last week 's unrest , during a commemorative service in the center of @entity87 , eastern @entity7 relatives mourn in front of coffins of four people killed during clashes last week between @entity7 and @entity94 forces , during a commemoration service in the centre of @entity87 , eastern @entity7 @entity1 ’s contestants for this year ’s @entity98 were booed in @entity99 as it was announced they had qualified for the final of the annual competition			1
@entity103 and @entity104 had originally received a warm reception when they performed their song @entity107 during last night ’s semi-final			0
however , when the 17 - year - old @entity110 twins were voted into the final – which is to be held on saturday - boos from the 10,000 - strong audience erupted			0
in contrast , the audience clapped and cheered when @entity7 's @entity116 qualified for saturday 's final too			0
the annual competition is supposed to be completely removed from politics			0
however , the @entity7 crisis has raised anew questions about the competition 's scoring , which is partly done by phone voting across @entity41			0
even though @entity1 has annexed @entity128 , votes from the @entity127 peninsula will count for @entity7 because the phone operator there is still @entity7 , the @entity124 said			1
bookmakers place @entity7 in the top 10 and @entity1 at the bottom			1
the winner is picked by juries and television viewers across @entity41			0
the crisis in @entity7 , which has seen @entity1 seize @entity128 from its former @entity138 partner , is the worst between the @entity139 since the @entity140			1
@entity0 made his remarks after talks in @entity26 with @entity24 , head of the @entity143 , who promised a ' road map ' to defuse the stand - off			0
in what appeared to be a softening of his stance , @entity0 urged separatists to postpone the may 11 polls because he wanted to ' create the conditions for dialogue ' after weeks in which the @entity154 accused him of fuelling unrest			1
he said he had pulled back @entity1 forces from the @entity7 border after ' we were told constantly about concerns ' over their positioning			1
earlier , mr @entity55 warned the @entity9 was seeking to derail the impending presidential elections , brought about following the ousting of @entity7 's @entity165 president @entity164 in february by @entity18 protesters			0
he said : ' there should be no doubt the @entity1 government is trying to orchestrate conflict and provocations in the east and south of @entity7			1
' the immediate goal is the disruption of elections , although they might also be trying to provide a pretext for intervention			0
' urging caution over @entity0 's latest remarks , a @entity18 diplomat cited @entity184 talks last month involving the @entity77 and @entity78 when @entity1 signed up to a peace process to lower tension			1
the @entity154 claims @entity1 failed to implement the deal			0
@entity0 could be seeking to confuse or divide the @entity154 into delaying sanctions , or seeking a window to allow @entity3 separatists to flee from @entity87 where they are besieged			2
pro-russian gunmen carry the coffin of a person killed during clashes last week between @entity7 and @entity94 forces , during a commemoration service the @entity77 and @entity41 nations have increased diplomatic efforts ahead of @entity7 's may 25 presidential election , as a @entity165 insurgency continues to rock the country 's eastern regions an @entity204 priest attends a religious ceremony in front of the coffins of four people killed during last week 's operation @entity18 sources see @entity0 's main priority as disrupting @entity7 's presidential elections and making the country ungovernable – but achieving this by proxy rather that full - scale invasion			1
on friday the @entity165 region of @entity218 , officially part of @entity220 , will present a petition to @entity0 amounting to a massive demand to be incorporated into @entity1 , as happened with @entity128			2
this is likely to inspire the east of @entity7 to redouble its demands for @entity1 annexation , though another theory last night was that @entity0 realised the referendums would not produce the same overwhelming majority for joining @entity1 as in @entity128			1
@entity0 has urged @entity165 separatists to postpone the referendum vote , which is planned to go ahead in five days ¿ time relatives mourn in front of the casket of a person killed during last week 's operation , during a commemorative service in eastern @entity7 an @entity204 priest sprinkles water during a religious ceremony in front of the coffins of four people killed during last week 's operation			1
