by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin the events of january 5 , when @entity2 subsided in the equivalent of a session at the @entity5 , feel like another world now			1
and yet , when the first test against @entity9 starts on thursday , it will not take much to return to that indecently hasty afternoon			1
at @entity11 on monday evening , where @entity2 ’s players and administrators and backroom staff had gathered for their annual @entity16 shindig , it felt like the first day of term , as nerves jostled for supremacy with natively cautious optimism			2
such dinners are always the perfect occasion for sportsmen : nothing has gone wrong yet ( save a limited - overs series defeat or two by @entity9 ) , and the positive thinking of the athlete ’s mental make - up can be politely asserted without too much fear of contradiction			1
humiliated : @entity2 's players react after their 5 - 0 whitewash by @entity33 is confirmed in @entity5 gearing up : @entity9 captain @entity34 trains at @entity11 on tuesday when i raised the subject of @entity39 ’s first column in that morning ’s @entity40 with a senior member of the @entity2 outfit , it was pointed out to me that we had not even finished our starter			1
throw in the idea that @entity2 are now entering a new era ( despite the fact that there are set to be as many debutants at @entity11 as there were at @entity5 ) , and the only reasonable script is this : @entity9 will not prove too indigestible before the five - course banquet against @entity53			1
if only it were that simple			0
@entity9 , as their victories in the one - off @entity58 match and the five - game one - day series demonstrated , are a serious team			1
their bowling attack looks less of a threat at @entity64 , but their batting is only ever a 250 - run stand between @entity68 and @entity69 away from taking the initiative in a two - @entity72 series			1
lord ’s tends to be pretty flat these days , especially when the sun is out – and @entity9 are thrilled not to be here in chilly may			2
while the @entity77 have been warming up with a four - day game at @entity79 , several of the @entity2 players will arrive at @entity11 without any serious cricket under their belts since june 3			1
and , on their last three visits to @entity85 , @entity9 have amassed totals of 555 for 8 ( in 2002 ) , 537 for 9 ( 2006 ) and 479 ( 2011 )			2
@entity68 would love to join @entity87 and @entity69 ( as well as coach @entity88 ) on the honours board			0
just as there is business as yet unstarted for @entity2 , so there is unfinished business for @entity9			1
one former @entity2 player in the @entity95 last night was bullish about his old team ’s prospects			2
‘ we ’ll just bounce ’ em out , ’ he said , blithely taking refuge in an old stereotype			0
a current member of the team confided that the @entity104 of @entity105 by @entity106 had leant the test series ‘ a real edge ’ – though he was less decisive when it came to explaining how many warnings a bowler needs to give the non-striker before whipping off the bails			1
@entity113 : @entity105 ( right ) is given out after @entity106 's controversial appeal but none of this could obscure the real question – namely , the extent to which @entity118 and @entity119 have it in them to lead @entity2 back to the promised land			1
it feels impolite to question this pair before they have really started , but it is reasonable to point out that both men have a point to prove			0
@entity118 will be watched closely for evidence of tactical acumen – for while there is little chance of him being exposed on that score later in the summer by the frighteningly conservative @entity136 , there is every chance he will be out - manoeuvred by the @entity77			0
@entity119 , too , must back up his claims that he has learned from the errors he made first time round			2
he must prove , above all , that he is more than a well - intentioned mr @entity141			0
at this stage , he deserves the benefit of the doubt			0
@entity2 have lost only two tests out of 13 at home to @entity9 , and one of those was on a dustbowl at @entity148 in 1998 that felt more like @entity150 than @entity151 ; @entity152 duly put in the performance of his life to take 16 wickets			1
equally , @entity2 have never lost the appetite - whetter ever since the test summer was divided in 2000			1
moment in time : @entity152 gets mobbed on his way to picking up 16 wickets at the @entity148 in 1998 for more cricket - related snippets , feel free to go to twitter.com / the_topspin but the one - dayers precede the @entity72 now , which means tourists are less likely to be caught cold – literally or metaphorically			1
and @entity9 are experts at exploiting a sense of persecution ( the querying of @entity106 ’s action has done the job this time ) for their own advantage			2
this series was looks tasty enough already			0
@entity175 @entity39 thinks he knows why @entity2 did n’t give the coaching job to @entity177			1
it had nothing , apparently , to do with the @entity58 defeat by the @entity181 – before which , it was generally agreed , @entity177 stood a decent chance of replacing @entity184 on a permanent basis			1
no , @entity39 ’s interpretation centres around … @entity39 ! ‘ sadly i think he was just too close to me for the @entity189 ’s liking , ’ he wrote in the @entity40			2
‘ that is the problem			0
he had spoken too positively about me in @entity33 for the @entity189 to give him the job			0
it is a shame for both sides			0
’ it ’s a wonder , then , that the @entity189 even bothered to allow @entity177 his dress rehearsals in the @entity198 and @entity199 before turning him down			2
both took place after @entity33 , which is when @entity39 imagines @entity177 sealed his own fate			1
old acquaintances : @entity39 and @entity177 ( right ) first played together for @entity2 in 2004 @entity204 ’s last night offered the chance to watch a brief video summing up @entity2 ’s year			1
there was plenty to see of the 3 - 0 win over @entity33 , as well as the women ’s team back - to - back @entity212 wins – fine achievements one and all			0
but the treatment of the 5 - 0 whitewash would have done @entity217 proud			0
all we saw was footage of @entity227 ’s five - for in the first innings of the series at @entity222 , and a pull shot by @entity224 during his century at @entity226			0
of @entity229 there was not a peep			0
tormentor - in - chief : but @entity229 's performances have been scrubbed from @entity2 's record books @entity235 secretary @entity234 almost seemed to speak with pride when he told the @entity237 of @entity53 last week that his board threatened to form ‘ a second @entity242 of its own ’ if their demands for a greater slice of the pie were not meant			2
it ’s good to have it confirmed that the @entity235 continues to take its position as the leaders of the world game seriously			0
according to the @entity242 ’s cricket committee , ‘ there are a number of bowlers currently employing suspect actions in international cricket , and the @entity242 ’s reporting and testing procedures are not adequately scrutinising these bowlers ’			0
until now , the response of some bowlers to the accusation that their action simply looks wrong has been to say that they have been tested and passed by the @entity242			0
that logic may no longer cut the mustard .			0

@entity2 take on @entity9 in two - test series starting this thursday
@entity119 ' first @entity72 series in second spell as @entity2 head coach
@entity9 won five - match odi and @entity58 match already
@entity39 think his *friendship* with @entity177 cost @entity2 job
