@entity0 has offered no guarantees that he will still be in charge at @entity3 next season			1
the @entity3 face relegated @entity6 on sunday as they bring the curtain down on a remarkable campaign , in which @entity0 has hauled them from the bottom three in november to mid-table			2
but the @entity12 boss will hold talks with chairman @entity14 next week and wants assurances about the direction of the club before deciding whether the trip to @entity19 will be his last game at the helm			1
ambitious : @entity3 manager @entity0 could leave the club this summer despite their success ' will i be here next season ? i hope so , ' he said			1
' i 've got two years left on my contract but there are managers with longer than that who get the sack , so you can never say i 'm going to be here 100 percent			2
' i think there are certain things that should be done at football clubs to enable them to be successful			2
' the club has a window of opportunity , the best opportunity the club has had for a long , long time to actually go forth and improve on and off the pitch			1
' i had a smashing meeting with @entity14 on thursday			2
we 'll get the game out of the way on sunday and @entity14 will have spoken to the other directors about my thoughts about moving the club on , and we will all be having dinner again next week when no doubt those discussions will go on further			1
' you ca n't stop speculation and people saying he 's going to do this or that			2
the two most important people at a club are the chairman and the manager			0
my relationship with @entity14 has grown stronger and stronger the longer i have been at the club			0
' fans ' favourite : @entity0 has become popular with @entity3 supporters after guiding them to @entity67 safety @entity0 guided his former club @entity68 into the top flight and turned them into @entity67 mainstays over the next five years , and clearly he wants to achieve the same with @entity3			1
' there 's so much work to be done but @entity14 recognises that , ' he added			0
' are we at loggerheads ? no we are n't , he understands what 's needed			0
' ' @entity68 had been outside the top league for 20 - odd years and that should n't have happened with the support up there			1
' i had a chairman who agreed with what we wanted to do			0
if the two of you pull in the same way and you get results you can move mountains			0
we did that at @entity68 and we can do it at @entity3			1
' i 've been amazed about how passionate the supporters have been and how big the club could be - there are millions of chimney pots around here , and wherever there are chimney pots there are people who will come and watch football			0
' @entity0 will have a fully - fit squad at @entity6 after striker @entity103 recovered from the illness which kept him out of the 3 - 3 draw with @entity106 on monday			0
character : the fightback from 3 - 0 to 3 - 3 on monday was a prime example of @entity0 ' hard work paying off			0
