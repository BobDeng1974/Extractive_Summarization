one small drill for @entity2 's @entity1 is one giant leap for mankind 's understanding of @entity7 ' formation from a climate ' potentially hosting life ' to the cold , dry landscape it is today			1
on wednesday september 24 the robotic @entity1 drilled 2.6 inches into an area of the base of @entity14 , a structure that reaches 3.4 miles towards the sky			1
the rover collected rock samples that it will later analyse with the rover 's on - board instruments , reports @entity21			0
data and images received on thursday at @entity2 ’s @entity24 in @entity25 confirmed success of the rock collection mission , @entity2 said in a statement released on thursday			0
hole for the history books : this image shows the first sample - collection hole drilled in @entity14 , the layered mountain that is the science destination of the @entity1 's extended mission rover rocks ! : this image is an artist 's rendition of the @entity1 that is currently exploring the martian territory to gain a better understanding of how the planet formed and if it could have hosted alien life what is @entity7 ? @entity7 is the fourth planet from the sun and the next planet beyond @entity45			1
it is , on average , more than 142 million miles from the sun. @entity7 is about one - sixth the size of @entity45			2
@entity7 is known as the @entity7			2
it gets its red color from the iron in its soil			0
@entity7 is named for the ancient roman god of war			2
the @entity55 called the planet @entity56			0
the @entity58 and @entity55 associated the planet with war because its color resembles the color of blood			0
@entity7 has two small moons named @entity65			2
they are named for the sons of @entity56 , the @entity55 god of war			0
@entity69 means ' fear , ' and @entity71 means ' panic			0
' temperatures on @entity7 go way below freezing ! the average temperature on @entity7 is minus 80 degrees @entity75			0
its surface is rocky , with canyons , volcanoes and craters all over it			0
red dust covers most of its surface			0
@entity7 has clouds and wind , just as @entity45 does			0
what is the @entity1 ? curiosity is a car - sized , six - wheeled robot destined for @entity88 on @entity7			1
its mission : to see if @entity7 ever could have supported small life forms called microbes ... and if humans could survive there someday ! in addition to super-human senses that help us understand @entity7 as a habitat for life , @entity1 's parts are similar to what a human would need to explore @entity7 ( body , brains , eyes , arm , legs , etc. )			1
scientists hope that the rock samples will give them a better understanding of how @entity7 ' @entity14 formed and what sorts of environmental events led to its growth			1
' this drilling target is at the lowest part of the base layer of the mountain , and from here we plan to examine the higher , younger layers exposed in the nearby hills , ' said curiosity deputy project scientist @entity119 of @entity24			1
' this first look at rocks we believe to underlie @entity14 is exciting because it will begin to form a picture of the environment at the time the mountain formed , and what led to its growth , ' he added			2
scientists are specifically interested in @entity14 and are studying the rocks for clues about how @entity7 shifted from a possibly warm and wet world to a cold , dry , and barren landscape			1
the red planet : @entity7 is the fourth planet from the sun and the next planet beyond @entity45 and is called the red planet because of its blood - red hue journey : this map shows the route driven by @entity2 's @entity1 from the @entity142 location where it first landed to the @entity144 outcrop where it drilled into the lowest part of @entity14 the curiosity rover landed on @entity7 in august 2012 and first studied an area near the landing site in the @entity148 of @entity7			1
the rover drilled holes in an ancient lakebed that may have hosted microbial life over three billion years ago			0
@entity1 began its 5 mile journey to @entity14 in july 2013 and reached an outcrop at the mountain 's base called @entity144 one week ago			1
this was the moment scientists had been waiting for after 15 months and hundreds of millions of miles of travel			1
' we 're putting on the brakes to study this amazing mountain , ' said @entity1 deputy project manager @entity164 of @entity24			1
' @entity1 flew hundreds of millions of miles to do this , ' he added			1
on monday september 22 the rover test drilled an area at the base of the mountain to gage sample collection			2
the trial went well so that ’s why the team decided to go on a drilling mission on wednesday			0
a mission team will deliver a powdered rock sample to @entity1 's open scoop were they will be able to determine if it 's safe to send the rover 's internal instruments called @entity183 ( @entity184 at @entity7 ) and @entity185 )			2
say dust ! : this image taken by the @entity1 's @entity188 shows the @entity190 outcrop and surrounding terrain , as seen from a position about 70 feet ( 20 meters ) northwest of the outcrop			0

on wednesday september 24 the robotic @entity1 drilled 2.6 inches into an area of the base of @entity14
scientists are specifically interested in @entity14 and are studying the rocks for clues about how @entity7 shifted from possible *wetland* to dry landscape
' @entity1 flew hundreds of millions of miles to do this , ' said @entity1 deputy project manager @entity164
