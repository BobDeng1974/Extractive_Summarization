had arranged for a substitute priest to cover for him while he took time out to reflect on his vows double life unmasked after his niece @entity3 who was with him on cruise posted online that her family , including ' @entity6 ' , were safe by @entity7 last updated at 6:53 pm on 27th january 2012 father @entity8 lied to his friends and told them he was going on a spiritual retreat but was actually on the @entity12 cruise liner disaster a roman catholic priest who lied to his flock and told them he was going on a spiritual retreat is actually a survivor from the @entity12 cruise liner disaster , it emerged today			1
father @entity8 ’s double life was unmasked on @entity19 after his niece @entity3 , who was with him on the ill fated @entity12 , posted that she and all her family ' including uncle @entity6 ' were safe and well			1
the 41 - year - old clergyman had told church parishioners earlier this month that he was going on a ‘ spiritual retreat ’ for a couple of weeks and had arranged for a substitute priest to cover for him while he took time out to reflect on his vows as well as meditate and pray			1
locals at @entity28 near @entity29 were delighted for him and waved him off with their full backing - although today they were furious to learn that instead of being on a retreat he had set off on a week ’s cruise and was among more than 4,000 passengers and crew on the doomed boat that hit rocks two weeks ago			2
one furious local said : ' it ’s a bit difficult to understand how he was going to go on a spiritual retreat onboard a cruise liner			2
all those comforts and luxuries , all that onboard enjoyment it just does n’t sit well with a spiritual , prayerful retreat			0
we are not at all happy that we have been tricked here and we want to see what @entity51 and the diocese have to say			0
' father @entity6 had boarded the @entity12 at @entity54 with several members of his family for the week ’s cruise and they were among those who were rescued as the ship went down just off the coast of @entity60 with the death toll now standing at 16 dead and at least 13 still missing			1
on board : the 41 - year - old clergyman had told parishioners that he was going on a ' spiritual retreat ' for a couple of weeks but had really boarded the @entity12 cruise liner disaster within hours of being rescued @entity3 wrote on her @entity19 page : ' @entity6 and granny @entity68 are all safe			1
we all managed to get onto the lifeboats and we are safe and well			0
' the posting was spotted by friends who quickly spread the word that @entity51 - who was in the headlines last year after he wrote a letter to a religious magazine slamming controversial former prime minister @entity77 for his dubious private life - was actually on a luxury cruise instead of being on a spiritual retreat as he had said			1
protest : a banner reading ' @entity60 cries out - hands off captain @entity83 ' hangs on a balcony close to the stricken cruise liner in reference to the retired captain @entity88 , that the @entity12 's captain was waving to when the ship ran aground safeguarding : an oil recovery sea platform is seen next to the @entity12 cruise ship on his @entity19 page @entity51 says he has been a priest since 1996 at @entity28 and he also lists @entity29 as his favourite football team , as well as pope @entity95 as one of his inspirations - as well as the film @entity99			1
today when contacted an embarrassed sounding father @entity6 said : ' well what more do you expect me to say ? you have all the story			2
there is nothing to add			0
i ’m still a little shocked but everyone who i was with is okay			0
i will explain everything to my parishioners when i get back to the church - i ’m not bothered about what people say about me			0
' no - one was available for official comment at his local bishop ’s office but a source there said : ' we are aware of the reports and shall be speaking to him to hear what he has to say			0
