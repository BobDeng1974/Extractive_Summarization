the moving message from @entity4 's closest comrade sir @entity9 reveals that the party were resigned to their fate as the end approached			1
' this looks like a finish to our undertaking , ' @entity9 wrote as the party attempted the return from the @entity19 , ' for we are out of food and oil and not able to move for three days now on account of the blizzard			2
' brave to the last : the final moving letter written from captain @entity4 's doomed @entity19 expedition by sir @entity9 stoic explorers : lieutenant @entity28 , dr @entity9 and mr @entity29 beside their sledge , just before starting on their doomed @entity33 journey his letter to publisher @entity35 had remained undiscovered since 1913 until an archivist happened to inspect an old box of documents			1
addressed to ' my dear good friend and my dear mr @entity35 ' , the communication shows a man who was stoic until the last			2
@entity43 fated : @entity33 explorer captain @entity4 @entity9 wrote : ' we have had a long struggle against intense cold on very short fuel , and it has done us in			1
' the story of the @entity50 expedition is explored in a mixture of newly discovered and rarely seen letters , diaries and photographs of its members , in an exhibition at @entity59 ’s @entity58			2
the exhibition tells the full story of the fateful expedition , not just through the famous journals and letters of @entity4 , @entity28 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity9 , who died on their way back from the @entity19 , but through other members of the ship ’s crew and shore party			1
curator @entity73 said : ' this really is a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to see these manuscripts exhibited together			0
' some of them are so fragile and valuable that they probably wo n’t go on display again for another hundred years			0
' we ’re not just talking about the ‘ race to the pole ’ here , we ’re talking about an entire crew of men , each telling their own story in their own way - and perhaps a different story from those you ’re already familiar with			0
' among items on display is the rarely seen second journal of @entity92 who accompanied @entity4 to the @entity19 and died alongside him on the return journey			1
this fragile volume has been repaired especially for the exhibition and the full text will be published for the first time , along with @entity28 ’ letters home , in a limited edition in mid-december			0
archivist @entity100 said : ' this is not the journal of somebody who set out knowing they were going to die			1
' as the expedition progresses , his notes become much less detailed as he concentrates on survival			0
sketch book : this book belonged to polar explorer sir @entity9 , which goes on show at the @entity114 at the @entity59 last letter : captain @entity4 's last letter to his widow , left , is part of a new exhibition showcasing many rarely seen letters and artefacts from his expedition to the @entity19 in 1912 , right heroic adventurers : @entity9 's letter reveals that the crew knew they were going to die as the end approached ' it becomes very focused on the distance travelled each day as that was vital to calculate how far they were from food supplies			1
' it includes a reference to @entity65 , the first to die , which reads : ' @entity136 legs still bad , also @entity65 ’s fingers			2
' also on display is @entity4 ’s journal which includes @entity66 ’ famous parting comment : ' i ’m just going outside and may be some time			1
' @entity4 reflects on this : ' we all hope to meet the end in a similar spirit , and assuredly the end is not far			1
' alongside this is the seal skin sleeping bag used by @entity66			0
polar journal : @entity100 , archivist at the @entity114 at the @entity59 , holds the journal of polar explorer @entity28 flashback to 1911 : captain @entity4 pictured writing at a table in his quarters at the @entity155 base camp in @entity33 detail of a letter from captain @entity4 describing the last time he saw @entity66 , saying ' i 'm just going outside and may be some time ' captain @entity4 led the expedition , officially called the @entity160 , with the aim to be the first to reach the geographical @entity19			1
but when his team of four companions got there on january 17 , 1912 , they found a @entity167 team led by @entity168 had already arrived 33 days earlier			0
@entity4 ’s entire team died in march during their return from a combination of exhaustion , starvation and extreme cold			1
captain @entity4 was a @entity175 officer and explorer from @entity177 , who had previously led the @entity179 to the @entity33 from 1901 - 1904			2
the exhibition highlights the ' @entity181 ' - the winter journey to collect eggs from the emperor penguin colony at @entity185			0

@entity194 , keeper of collections , said : ' in order to preserve naval discipline they drew an invisible line , demarcating the officers ’ mess			0
' there was a rule that if the other ranks heard something they should not have heard , they did not hear it			0
this rule was meticulously observed			0
' dr @entity9 ’s sketchbook including drawings of the tent belonging to @entity168 - who beat @entity4 ’s team to the pole - is also displayed			2
alongside the written material are items including the @entity217 decorations made by the 33 - strong show party , showing the realities of day - to - day life in the @entity33			2
the title of the exhibition - these @entity223 - comes directly from captain @entity4 ’s message to the public written at the end of his journal , just prior to his death			1
dated march 29 1912 , it reads : ' had we lived , i should have had a tale to tell of the hardihood , endurance , and courage of my companions which would have stirred the heart of every @entity239			0
' these rough notes and our dead bodies must tell the tale , but surely , surely , a great rich country like ours will see that those who are dependent on us are properly provided for			0
' next to the journal is @entity4 ’s last letter to his wife , which begins : ' dear widow			1
' the exhibition runs until may 5 .			0

' this is not the journal of somebody who set out knowing they were going to die ' , says archivist
