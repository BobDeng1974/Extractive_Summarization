the lunar dirt brought back by mankind 's first moonwalkers contained an abundance of titanium , platinum and other valuable minerals			1
but our satellite also contains a substance that could be of even greater use to civilisation – one that could revolutionise energy production			0
it 's called helium 3 and has been dumped on the moon in vast quantities by solar winds			1
@entity20 , scientists argue , could power clean fusion plants			1
two fully - loaded @entity23 cargo bay 's worth - about 40 tonnes worth - could power the @entity24 for a year at the current rate of energy consumption			2
pictured are the stages in getting the material back to @entity29 now @entity30 is looking to mine the moon for the rare helium isotope that some scientists claim could meet global energy demand far into the future , according to a report in @entity38			1
professor @entity39 , the chief scientist of the @entity40 , recently said , the moon is ' so rich ' in helium 3 , that this could ' solve humanity 's energy demand for around 10,000 years at least			1
' @entity20 , scientists argue , could power clean fusion plants			1
it is nonradioactive and a very little goes a very long way			0
for instance , two fully - loaded @entity23 cargo bay ’s worth - about 40 tonnes worth - could power the @entity24 for a year at the current rate of energy consumption			0
@entity20 is a light , non-radioactive isotope of helium with two protons and one neutron			1
it is abundant in the moon 's soil after being dumped there by solar winds			1
two fully - loaded @entity23 cargo bay ’s worth - about 40 tonnes worth - could power the @entity24 for a year at the current rate of energy consumption an artist 's impression of what mining in space			2
in this image hot gases are seen flowing through chambers @entity20 ( @entity20 ) is a light , non-radioactive isotope of helium with two protons and one neutron			1
its presence is rare on @entity29 , but it is sought after for use in nuclear fusion research			1
it is also used in @entity78 scanners and in sensors to detect smuggled plutonium			0
@entity20 is abundant in the moon 's soil by at least 13 parts per billion ( ppb ) by weight			1
the gas , he estimates , has a potential economic value of $ 3 billion ( £ 1.78 billion ) a tonne , making it economically viable to consider mining from the moon			0
according to experts in the @entity24 , the total estimated cost for fusion development , rocket development and starting lunar operations would be about $ 20 billion ( £ 11.8 billion ) over two decades			2
two fully - loaded @entity23 cargo bay ’s worth - about 40 tonnes worth - could power the @entity24 for a year at the current rate of energy consumption			0
this would require mining an areas the size of @entity102 this would require mining an areas the size of @entity102 the isotope is so rare on the @entity29 because our atmosphere and magnetic field prevent any of the solar helium 3 from arriving on the surface			1
the moon does n't have this problem as there is nothing to prevent helium 3 being absorbed by the lunar soil			2
@entity117 , a doctoral candidate at the @entity118 in @entity119 , recently wrote in @entity120 that helium 3 could be extracted by heating the lunar dust to around 600 ° c , before bringing it back to the @entity29			1
the gas , he estimates , has a potential economic value of $ 3 billion ( £ 1.78 billion ) a tonne , making it economically viable to consider mining from the moon			0
according to experts in the @entity24 , the total estimated cost for fusion development , rocket development and starting lunar operations would be about $ 20 billion ( £ 11.8 billion ) over two decades			0
while @entity30 has expressed an interest , it has yet to outline concrete plans about how it would mine the moon for helium			1
the prospect , however , raises the controversial issue about who owns our satellite			0
the @entity145 @entity144 , signed by @entity30 , suggests that lunar resources are for all mankind			2
@entity30 is hoping to mine helium 3 from the moon			1
the scenarios sounds like science fiction , and has been depicted in @entity152 through films such as the 1998 blockbuster armageddon starring @entity155 private groups are also interested in using fuel from the moon by mining water rather than helium however , legal experts claim the language is ambiguous enough to allow for commercial exploitation of the moon			0
in a recent paper , mr @entity117 said : ' @entity30 appears determined to make [ lunar mining ] a reality of tomorrow			2
' @entity30 maintains its lunar mining would be for the benefit of all humanity , ' he added			2
' however , given the absence of willful competitors , it is also speculated that the @entity30 intend to establish a helium 3 monopoly			2
' private enterprise is also interested in using fuel from the moon – although possibly by extracting water rather than helium 3			0
the @entity180 envisages providing propellant for missions throughout the solar system using lunar water			0
some teams vying for the @entity186 also see mining as an ultimate goal of their landers			0
@entity190 has also considered using the @entity191 to help missions farther into the @entity193			0
arguments have also been made for mining @entity20 from @entity195 , where it is much more abundant – it would need to be given the distances involved			0
extracting the molecule from @entity195 would also be a less power - hungry process .			0

@entity20 in dumped on moon 's surface in vast quantities by solar winds
the rare helium isotope could power clean fusion plants back on @entity29
it could be extracted from the moon by heating the lunar dust to 600 ° c
*astronauts* would then *shuttle* the nonradioactive material back to @entity29
while @entity30 has expressed an interest , it has yet to outline concrete plans about how it would mine the moon for helium
