by @entity0 e-fit : how @entity3 's top mafia boss @entity2 could look after a fresh sighting police have revealed a new e-fit of @entity3 's most wanted @entity2 after an informant saw him in hiding - where he has been for 21 years			1
convicted murderer @entity2 , now 51 , was last seen at a beach resort in 1993 and is said to have boasted of killing enough people to fill a cemetery			1
the new image has emerged just three months after police swooped on the town where @entity2 grew up in @entity14 and arrested his sister , cousin and nephew			1
police claim the fugitive , nicknamed diabolik after an @entity3 comic book master villain , still runs many of the @entity22 's rackets in @entity14 around the small town of @entity24 where he grew up			1
the son of a @entity22 boss , he is alleged to have used guns aged 14 and committed murder at 18 but could now be blind in one eye thanks to a retina disease , @entity3 news agency @entity31 reported			2
his disappearance from a resort in @entity34 two decades ago came after the so - called ' boss of bosses ' @entity36 ' @entity39 ' @entity38 was given life in jail for ordering bomb attacks on two state prosecutors			0
police say he was involved in five car bomb attacks in @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 which rocked the country over the summer of 1993 , leaving 10 people dead , injuring 93 and damaging @entity46 's @entity51 , which includes such treasures as @entity54 's birth of @entity55			2
rare sightings of @entity2 came in the mid- 1990s at an eye specialist in @entity58 , @entity59 , where he concealed his identity by omitting his second surname - which translates as ' money '			2
over the years , as many other @entity22 bosses were captured or killed , @entity2 moved up police rankings to claim the spot of the nation 's most wanted man			1
in 2002 , he was jailed for life in his absence for murder , @entity22 association and other crimes			2
the new images are notable because despite @entity2 's eye problems , one of the photo - fits does not picture him wearing glasses			1
age : the e-fit ( left ) of the playboy don ( right ) suggests he is heavier - set than before with a receding hairline arch - villain : the mafia boss is nicknamed @entity18 after the comic book criminal of the same name , pictured new descriptions of him suggest he is taller and heavier - set than thought before , with a receding hairline and hair which remains remarkably dark for his 51 years			0
the new image is the first in recent history to be based on an actual sighting , instead of computerised age progressions which were modelled on his driver 's licence			0
police have never captured an image of @entity2 on @entity102 , despite his reputation as a playboy with a love of sports cars and designer watches			1
yet investigators believe he has not strayed far from his home town , which has a population of just 30,000			0
a police statement in december said the @entity113 crime clan had ' an almost monopolistic control of the construction sector '			0
one project the mafia group is said to have infiltrated was the building of a wind farm to generate electricity for public roads and restaurants			0
wanted : previous computerised images of @entity2 , such as this one , have not been based on actual sightings and have only ' aged ' images which police already had			2
he is @entity3 's most wanted man police commander @entity127 said his team was closer than ever before to @entity2 in december after the arrest of 30 people , including his sister			1
@entity132 was led away to a police car at 3am after investigators claimed wire taps showed she had been in contact with her fugitive brother , and played a key role in transmitting his directives to other mobsters			0
prosecutor @entity141 told a press conference his ' sister can carry out a role , traditionally held by males			0
but this does n't mean that men were n't capable of taking @entity2 's place '			0
@entity148 , the fugitive 's cousin , and @entity151 , his nephew , were also among those arrested			0
police said in december that they had more suspects lined up , but were choosing to follow them covertly rather than arrest them and destroy a possible channel to @entity2 's whereabouts			1
crackdown : his sister @entity132 and cousin @entity148 were arrested in december prosecutor @entity158 ( left ) and police commander @entity127 ( right ) said they were closer than ever to finding the fugitive after 21 years in a press conference held in december , pictured			1

he is said to have boasted of killing enough people to fill a cemetery
