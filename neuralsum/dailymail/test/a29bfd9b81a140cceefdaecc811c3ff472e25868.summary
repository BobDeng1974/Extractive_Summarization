in the aftermath of sunday 's derby disaster the talk among fans was of summer incomings to reboot a blue machine that , all - of - a - sudden , looks as outdated as a @entity7			1
then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under - fire manager @entity11			1
but the biggest challenge for @entity13 this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have			1
@entity13 striker @entity17 looks on dejected during the defeat by @entity19 at @entity20 the afternoon started so well for @entity17 and @entity13 when he opened the scoring after just eight minutes @entity17 celebrates his 99th goal for @entity13 with @entity23 as @entity24 looks dejected it may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at @entity20 but there was an important landmark for the brilliant @entity17 that deserves to be recognised			1
the aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice - cream but the @entity36 's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration			1
take a minute to think where @entity13 would have been without that century			2
remember that title - winning goal against @entity44 in 2012 ? most , in that situation , would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from @entity50			0
the man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had @entity13 fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club 's long history			2
that calm head , that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what @entity13 paid what now looks like a bargain £ 38m for in 2011			2
@entity17 netted his 100th goal for @entity13 in the 89th minute but there was no cause for celebration the @entity36 strikes in injury time against @entity44 to win @entity13 the title in 2012 @entity17 celebrates with @entity75 after that goal when @entity13 scored twice in injury time to win title @entity17 is settled in @entity79 and signed a new five - year deal only last august			1
however , he now has to think of himself			0
if the unthinkable happens and @entity13 slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the @entity88 stage ? there are admirers			2
@entity91 and @entity92 are both fans			0
should either register an interest city would face a desperate battle to keep hold of their star man			0
while a move to @entity91 may come with an enticing caveat in the shape of @entity103 , the loss of @entity17 would be exceptionally difficult to recover from			2
where else do you get those goals from ? while it is too early in his @entity13 career to pass judgement it would appear that the burden would be too much for @entity114 's broad shoulders			0
@entity114 has only scored once in five appearances since joining @entity13 from @entity116 in january @entity13 's ageing squad is in need of a major overhaul in the summer @entity121 midfielder @entity120 is a potential target as the @entity13 owner prepares to open the cheque book the former @entity116 man , who cost just £ 10m less than @entity17 , has failed to hit the ground running since his january move and has scored only once in five appearances			1
the powers - that - be would no doubt have to open their chequebook but who would come to an @entity132 ? and , should they sleepwalk out of the top four , who would dream of coming to a club without @entity88 football ? the likes of @entity120 and @entity138 are potential targets			0
@entity140 understands discussions have already taken place with a number of new additions			0
but will they also want to come to a club shorn of its idol ? it is a big question and one that @entity13 will be desperate not to have to discover the answer to			0
@entity150 contract rebel @entity138 could also be on any list of summer targets @entity11 is facing the sack even if @entity13 qualify for the @entity88 there are others to ponder			1
does @entity11 stay ? and what share of the blame do executives @entity156 and @entity158 take ? are they at fault for spending the best part of £ 200m since 2012 without really strengthening the team or does @entity11 carry the can ? with @entity167 sanctions hurting , it was essential that @entity13 got bang for the buck			1
in reality they barely had a whimper			0
the pile on the in - tray on chairman @entity175 's desk seems to be getting taller every week			0
it is essential that keeping @entity17 is top of that ever - growing list or else that ageing blue machine risks heading for an even bigger crash .			1

@entity13 were beaten 4 - 2 by @entity19 at @entity20
defeat leaves @entity13 fourth in @entity186 , four points behind @entity19
@entity13 desperately need to strengthen an ageing squad in the summer
and it remains to be see whether @entity13 will stick with @entity11
but the biggest challenge could be keeping hold of @entity17
@entity36 scored a brace against @entity19 to take his tally for @entity13 to 100
