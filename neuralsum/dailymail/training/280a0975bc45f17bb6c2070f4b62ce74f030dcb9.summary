@entity0 , mother of a thug who killed an autistic man , dismissed his crime as ' no big deal ' last night the mother of a thug who killed an autistic man dismissed his crime as ‘ no big deal ’ last night			1
in a display of callous indifference , @entity11 said she did not know ‘ what all the fuss was about ’			1
her son @entity16 killed @entity17 with a single punch in an unprovoked attack captured on @entity20			1
he was given just four years but a public outcry may lead to a longer sentence			2
the attorney general says he will examine whether the jail term was too short			0
@entity26 ’s office was deluged with more than 110 complaints within hours of the case becoming public			0
mr @entity17 ’s mother @entity29 has dismissed the sentence as an ‘ absolute joke ’ – @entity32 could even be free within two years			1
but mrs @entity36 , speaking from her home in @entity34 , @entity35 , yesterday insisted her son was a ‘ good kid ’			1
the 41 - year - old mother of three told the @entity39 : ‘ it was just an accident			1
it ’s not a big deal			0
this will all be forgotten tomorrow			0
he ’s my son , what do you want me to say ? he did n’t mean to kill him and that ’s that			0
’ mrs @entity36 , who was not married to @entity32 ’s father @entity47 , added : ‘ this story will be the lining of chips tomorrow			1
i just do n’t understand what all the fuss is about			2
’ @entity32 , a convicted robber , punched 40 - year - old mr @entity17 to the ground on a busy @entity55 street on november 6 last year			1
shocking @entity20 footage shows him calmly walking forward to deliver the deadly punch after mr @entity17 reprimanded his friend for cycling on the pavement			1
mr @entity17 , who had @entity60 ’s and the social skills of a 14 - year - old , fell back and cracked his head on the pavement			1
he died the next day with his 71 - year - old mother at his bedside			1
@entity32 , 20 , pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to four - and - a - half years by judge @entity68 at @entity69			1
with half his sentence served on licence , and allowing for time already served , he could be out in just two years			1
the sentence was condemned by @entity73 ’ commissioner @entity74 , whose husband @entity75 was killed by a gang vandalising his car			2
‘ i ’m appalled by this disgraceful act of violence – my thoughts go out to the victim ’s family and friends at this time , ’ she said			1

@entity32 ( right ) pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter and was jailed for four - and - a - half years ‘ it ’s entirely right that the sentence will be reviewed for this shocking crime			1
‘ i know how traumatic it is to go through the courts as a victim – when you are already so hurt and vulnerable			2
that ’s why i urge everyone involved in this case to put victims first in the pursuit of justice			2
’ the @entity17 family ’s mp , @entity102 , welcomed mr @entity26 ’s review as well			1
‘ it would be wrong for me to make a judgment about how long the sentence ought to be , it is not the role of an mp to do that , ’ he said			1
‘ but the message needs to go out that this kind of behaviour should not be tolerated			2
i would be the first to advocate people standing up and speaking out when they see wrongdoing in their community and that is one of the reasons that a sentence like this is totally out of line			0
’ mr @entity26 has until march 21 to decide whether he thinks the sentence was too soft			1
if – as seems likely – he does , the case will go to the @entity124 where three senior judges could lengthen it			0

even if he did n’t intend to cause death he punched someone who was clearly no threat to him and who made no threatening gestures of violence back			0
‘ is n’t it about time the people were heard ? these lenient sentences are harmful to the decent members of society			0
’ a statement issued on behalf of the @entity17 family said : ‘ when we first heard that @entity32 was given a four year sentence we thought it was too short and expected him to get more than that			1
he ( @entity32 ) did n’t mean to kill him so a life sentence would have been extreme but he deserves more than what he was given			2
‘ looking at his criminal record he is obviously a trouble maker and we were hoping he would get about seven or eight years			2
‘ a sentence so short might mean that he could do something else dangerous in the future			0
’ @entity68 , 63 , refused to discuss the case yesterday at @entity174 the judge who sent @entity16 to prison for just four years did not respond to criticism of what has been called an ‘ extremely lenient ’ sentence			1

i ’ve made my decision			0
if i am wrong the @entity124 will deal with it ”			0
’ the father of two , who is a lay canon at @entity203 , has also defended his sometimes controversial approach to the legal process			0
this was most notable in his handling of the inquest into the shooting of @entity210 , where he held a 20 - second silence to commemorate the gangster ’s death			0
the judge admits that he enjoys having the power to show leniency but he reacted angrily to ministerial criticism of ‘ soft ’ sentencing back in 2006 when he was secretary of the @entity220			2
in october 2004 , he handed teenager @entity221 an 18 - month supervision order for striking @entity223 round the head with a 4ft wooden pole during a robbery			0
judge @entity68 told the defendant : ‘ you know , and i know , that you richly deserve custody and you would have got three years			2
but you must know that if you fail me and go wrong on this order , you will be back before the courts			0
