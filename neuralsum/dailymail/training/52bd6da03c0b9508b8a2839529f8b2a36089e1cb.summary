as a big girl in a world which has always wanted me to be thin , i know all about fat shaming			1
it is a relatively new term , yet it describes an age - old attitude to those of us to whom the size - 10 rail at @entity10 might as well be the tip of @entity13 ; to people who , for whatever reason , fail to keep their size in check			1
it stems from the belief that we are fat because we are weak - willed , slovenly and very possibly subnormal			1
like naughty puppies who do their business where they ought not to , we must be punished by having our noses rubbed in it until we learn the error of our ways			0
there ’s just one problem : it does n’t work			0
not the puppy thing ( although , actually , that does n’t work either ) but the being mean to fatties in the hope they will lose weight			1
' the more they tried to get me to diet , the hungier i became , ' she said a team at @entity47 has found that people who are made to feel ashamed about their size are six times as likely to overeat as a result			1
far from encouraging them to lose weight , being criticised simply drives them to comfort - eat more			1
without wishing to denigrate the work of the good scientists at @entity47 , i could have told them that for nothing			1
all my life people have been telling me to lose weight			1
and all my life it has only made me want to eat more			1
it started as a teenager			0
i ’d been a skinny child so , when i began to put on weight , there was concern			1
no one in my family is fat			1
we have many other faults — drunkenness , promiscuity , greed — but never obesity			0
at first , my pudge was tolerated			0
there was a feeling that i ’d grow out of it , that it was just a phase			0
then — and i ca n’t quite remember when — it became a thing			0
it did n’t help , of course , that my mother was as thin as a whippet and a more beautiful version of @entity87			0
at dinner time i would reach for seconds and there would be a certain amount of throat - clearing			1
did i really think another potato was wise ? would n’t i prefer some green beans instead ? or perhaps just a glass of water to fill me up ? she said it did n't help that her mother , pictured , was as thin as a whippet and a more beautiful version of @entity87 if people offered me food , it would be refused on my behalf			1
at one point , a weight - loss self - hypnosis tape mysteriously appeared in my cassette player			1
someone was clearly trying to communicate a message : i was overweight and i needed to do something about it			0
but instead of jolting me into action , all this heavy hinting just served to entrench my eating			1
for the first time in my life , i began to steal food			1
i was hungry , see			0
hungry for the unconditional love that only a slice of hot buttered toast with @entity122 can offer			0
i became an expert stealth - eater			1
( i still am : i can walk past a table of canapés and hoover up half of them before most people have had a chance to take off their coat			2
) i began to associate eating with a furtive kind of pleasure			2
i carried on putting on weight and , before long , i was the same dress size as my age — 14			2
no one could understand why : all the snacks were under lock and key , and mealtimes were closely monitored			0
but the reason was simple : the more they tried to get me to diet , the hungrier — and more cunning — i became			0
i started hanging out at friends ’ houses in the hope of scoring some food			2
@entity150 houses ( i grew up in @entity150 ) are full of food			2
lovely , delicious , generous quantities of guilt - free food — quite a lot of it pasta - related			1
while at home food was rationed ; here it was freely on offer			2
i quickly learnt to binge			0
what i could n’t eat , i hid — to be enjoyed later in the privacy of our bathroom ( that being the only room in the house that had a lock on the door )			2
let me tell you , you have n’t lived until you ’ve eaten mushroom tagliatelle out of the sink			0
of course , my family were only trying to help			0
they wanted the best for me and , for them , the best meant looking gloriously lean and lovely on the beach			0
they ’d say things like , ‘ you ’d be really pretty if you lost a couple of stone			0
’ and they were probably right			0
but that knowledge only made me feel more sad , which made me even hungrier			0
one @entity183 — i remember it as clear as day — i ate an entire bag of mini @entity187 bars			0
when this was discovered , i was in so much trouble that i was banished to my room for @entity183 dinner , like a naughty fat labrador			2
not only was i greedy , i was now also morally reprehensible			0
after all , what kind of person ruins @entity183 ? throughout my teens , this idea became firmly entrenched			2
thin people are good and virtuous , useful and productive members of society ; fat people are spineless parasites			1
that is why , when i put on weight , i am consumed by self - loathing			1
when i am thin ( or something approximating thin ) , by contrast i could conquer the world			0
people ’s responses only served to reinforce this notion			2
if i dropped half a stone , friends and family would congratulate me and lionise me			0
once , i was treated to a shiny new wardrobe — from @entity215 , in those days the height of sophistication — purely thanks to my ability to fit into a size 12			0
the message was clear : being thin and being loved were , if not exactly the same thing , then very much in neighbouring ballparks			0
all of which is a very long - winded and rather self - centred way of saying that losing weight is not as simple as eating less			1
no matter what people like @entity227 — the tv personality and former @entity229 star , who has deliberately piled on four stone in a bid to show fat people like me that shedding the weight is just a question of willpower and discipline — might think			1
because , in the majority of cases , being overweight is not a symptom of moral lassitude , laziness or just sheer piggery ; it ’s a symptom of a deep - rooted psychological problem			2
my own theory — for what it ’s worth — is that fat people are depressed			1
when the mind is healthy , it simply does n’t tell the body to overeat			2
essentially , fat people are people who , instead of turning to alcohol , cigarettes or drugs to cope with their troubles , self - medicate with food			1
@entity37 says fat people are usually depressed and need help , not humiliation there are no end of lavishly funded programmes to help people who abuse alcohol or drugs			1
armies of doctors and nurses and counsellors with sympathetic nods and understanding smiles and government - funded budgets			2
smokers can get patches and help on the @entity276			0
drink and drug addicts get taxpayer - funded rehab , @entity279 and @entity280			1
crucially , all these highly addictive and physically destructive substances are in some way controlled , either in the form of taxation or by the law			0
@entity288 , by contrast ( which studies have found lights up the same area of the human brain as cocaine , only more so ) , is freely and cheaply available to everyone			0
so what kind of help do fat people get ? humiliation and mockery and harridans like @entity227 treating them with utter contempt and scorn and turning their condition into a reality tv show and , no doubt , a lucrative book and @entity308 deal			1
of course @entity227 is not going to struggle to get back into her size 8 dresses			0
the woman has the sensitivity of @entity313 combined with the modesty of @entity315			0
she may well have psychological problems , but they ’re not because of her self - loathing			2
fat people get doctors like the one who , when i was first diagnosed with an underactive thyroid , made me strip to my pants and pinched my tummy before telling me to restrict myself to 1,200 calories a day for the rest of my life			1
i was 28 at the time			0
and we get a food industry that is free to peddle the high - sugar , high - calorie , high - carbohydrate diet , which is the architect of our destruction , at rock - bottom prices			1
for someone who struggles with emotional eating , the corner - shop sweet counter is the equivalent to handing an alcoholic the keys to the cellar			1
nine out of ten fat people do n’t want to be fat			1
just as most drunks would rather be sober and most drug addicts clean			2
they need help , not humiliation ; sympathy , not aggression ; and , yes , a bit of help from society to keep them on the straight and narrow			1
above all , they need to reset their relationship with food			2
that means learning to see it once again as fuel , and not as comfort or a place of refuge from all those cruel and counterproductive jibes			2
all of which would be an awful lot easier if people would be a little more understanding .			0

scientists say telling people they *'re* fat makes them comfort - eat 6 times more
@entity37 said people hinting about her weight entrenched her eating
but she says fat people are depressed and simply self - medicate with food
while alcoholics get help , food addicts just get humiliation and mockery
she said : ' they need help , not humiliation ; sympathy , not aggression '
