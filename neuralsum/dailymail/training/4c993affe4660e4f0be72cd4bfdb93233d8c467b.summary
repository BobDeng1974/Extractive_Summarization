a dog on death row will for the first time in history have its case heard in @entity6 ’s highest court			2
condemned @entity9 terrier @entity7 is set to be destroyed after she bit a woman in august 2012 after escaping from her owner @entity11 ’s backyard in @entity13 , east @entity14 , @entity15			1
the woman who @entity7 bit suffered a 1.5cm to her finger on 4 august 2012 , which is deemed as a ‘ serious injury ’ under the @entity20 in @entity15 law , and @entity7 was seized by the council in june 2013			1
lawyers representing the dog at no cost to the client say the local council that is fighting for @entity7 ’s destruction in the @entity29 is wasting public money by perusing the case			1
city of @entity34 council has refused @entity36 @entity6 ’s offer to rehabilitate the pet and assume all liability for her at no extra cost from the time of collection			1
‘ the council is prepared to spend a six figure sum fighting to kill a dog when they might lose in the @entity29 , ’ barrister @entity43 , founder of the @entity44 told @entity45			1
condemned @entity9 terrier @entity7 is set to be destroyed but could be saved by a final @entity29 bid ‘ no dog should be allowed to be killed by a council expect by court order , ’ mr @entity43 argued			1
in normal circumstances @entity7 ’s case would never have made it to the @entity29 but her fate has taken an unusual twist due to the manner in which the local council made in administrative decision for her to be put down			1
in september 2013 , @entity7 ’s owner ms @entity11 pleaded guilty to charges of her dog causing ‘ serious injury ’ at @entity67 but the local council , the @entity34 , did not apply for a destruction order on @entity7 from the magistrate at that time			1
if they had applied for the order from the magistrate , the question of whether the penalty ( death ) was proportionate to the injury caused ( a 1.5 centimetre cut ) would have been raised on appeal to a judge at the county court			2
instead , the council ruled that the dog should be destroyed during a council panel meeting			1
in a letter to the @entity34 council , the ceo of @entity36 sa @entity88 , wrote an offer to assess and then possibly rehabilitate and rehome @entity7 at no cost to the council instead of seeing her destroyed			1
the letter , seen by @entity45 and written on september 9 , 2014 , said : ‘ as discussed late last week , i can confirm that @entity36 @entity6 would be happy to transport the dog known as @entity7 ( owned by @entity11 ) to our @entity95 here in @entity98 in order for her to undergo an extensive behavioural assessment under the guidance of our qualified behaviourists			2
’ ‘ this would involve a wide variety of behavioural interactions and analysis both inside and outside kennels , in our indoor behavioural centre and our outdoor fenced enclosures			0
the purpose of this would be to determine , in as thorough a manner as possible , the rehabilitation prospects of this dog			0
‘ we are able to arrange collection and transport at no expense to @entity34			0
@entity36 @entity6 are prepared to take @entity7 into our care and custody and assume all liability for this dog from the time of collection			0
’ during the panel hearing , which took place on 30 september , 2013 , at @entity127 , one of the people on the panel was the same council officer who brought the charges against @entity7 ’s owner ms @entity11			2
the team of barristers fighting @entity7 ’s case from the @entity44 , including @entity136 and @entity137 , is now challenging the decision that the panel came to based on administrative law grounds			1
‘ the council officer who brought the charges then sat as a member of the three person panel which decided to put the dog down , ’ mr @entity43 told @entity45			2
‘ the question of law is whether a fair minded observer might think that the accuser sitting on a panel is a ) a conflict of interest or b ) with a disposition of pre judgement			0
’ @entity7 has been living in a cage at the @entity36 centre in @entity15 for almost 21 months while the legal battle has played out			0
@entity15 ’s highest court first upheld the decision to destroy her on september 10 , 2014 , but the barristers have now been granted @entity163 permission to appeal to the @entity164			0
mr @entity43 admitted : ‘ it ’s a bit of a story			0
’ ‘ only one in ten cases get through on special leave application			0
’ in a letter to the @entity34 council , the ceo of @entity36 sa @entity88 , wrote an offer to assess and then possibly rehabilitate and rehome her at no cost to the council instead of seeing her destroyed			1
but the council knocked back the offer			0
‘ rather than accept the offer and bring the matter to an end - avoiding legal proceedings at cost and removing her from their municipal boundaries of @entity34 - and not leaving a family heartbroken … the @entity34 refuses and now they have got to fight in the high court , ’ mr @entity43 said			2
@entity7 ’s case will be heard in court in april			0
a dog on death row will for the first time in history have its case heard in the @entity29 of @entity6			0

the @entity34 council made an ' administrative decision ' to kill @entity7
the @entity199 bit a woman in august 2012
she suffered a 1.5cm cut but it was *classed* as a ' serious injury '
@entity207 decided to destroy @entity7 during a council panel meeting
normally a magistrate decides whether a dog should be killed
the @entity44 are fighting her case at no cost
if they win the council will have to *pay* legal fees
@entity220 offered to take @entity7 and assess her for rehabilitation
