immigration opinion : @entity1 said he was delighted to have foreign neighbours and wanted a mixed country @entity6 should impose a @entity8 - style quota on the number of babies people can have rather than curb immigration , @entity1 has suggested			1
the wildlife expert and tv presenter said he was delighted to have foreign neighbours and wanted a mixed country			1
during a tv debate on immigration yesterday , he added : ‘ there should just as likely be a restriction on the number of children that @entity6 people have because over-population is what you are talking about here – the big problem			2
’ mr @entity1 , 73 , made his comments on @entity30 ’s @entity29 , arguing : ‘ so you say these perfectly well - qualified people ca n’t come in , but the woman down the road has just had her tenth baby			1
well i ’m sorry , but they are the people that really should be contained			2
it would make a difference			0
’ in 1979 , @entity8 introduced laws banning families from having more than one child			1
earlier this year , it eased the rules when the quota was raised to two for some couples			0
mr @entity1 , who has three daughters from two marriages , was lambasted for his comments			1
@entity48 , of @entity49 , said : ‘ i ’m surprised someone as wise and decent as @entity1 is coming up with that sort of nonsense			1
what he is saying is absurd			0
‘ he ’s right – population levels are increasing – but that is largely driven by immigration , not large @entity6 families			2
the current government has been successful in bringing down the numbers of people entering the country from outside the @entity62 to 1998 levels			2
‘ we are controlling immigration and we should continue to be aiming in that direction , rather than going down the @entity8 route of limiting the number of children people can have			1
earlier this year , it eased the regulations when the quota was raised to two for some couples mr @entity1 , who was a member of @entity81 comedy trio , claimed he was ‘ often ashamed to be @entity6 ’ ‘ we are not that sort of country			1
why we are such an attractive country is precisely because we do n’t make laws saying you will have this number of children only and no more			2
‘ chairman @entity90 went down that route years ago and i think @entity6 people would be horrified at the thought of anyone suggesting we do the same here			0
’ earlier in the programme , mr @entity1 , who was a member of @entity81 comedy trio , claimed he was ‘ often ashamed to be @entity6 ’			1

i personally loathe that kind of chauvinism and i ’m happy to say i ’m not proud to be @entity6			0
' in fact , i ’m very often ashamed to be @entity6			0
we are a terrible race , all the hooliganism and @entity109 knows what			0
' i love the fact that i walk down the road in north @entity113 , and down here ’s an @entity116 shop , and there ’s another @entity116 stationers there , and this one is run by someone from @entity121 , and there ’s a @entity116 guy who runs that bit , and we ’ve got the @entity126 builders next door who do n’t play the radio as loud as @entity131 builders			0
