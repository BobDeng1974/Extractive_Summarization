at least 100 families receiving housing benefit are living in luxury homes on handouts that could fund £ 1m mortgages , figures have revealed			1
more than 30 of those families are being given a staggering £ 1,500 a week to live ' swanky ' lifestyles - more than three times the national average wage			1
of the 100 families , 60 have their rent paid by the state to the value of £ 5,000 a month , according to the @entity12			1
at a time when millions of people are struggling to get on the housing ladder , the handouts would easily cover the monthly payments on a £ 1m mortgage			2
luxury : the kind of upmarket homes in @entity22 , west @entity23 , that the unemployed are being allowed to live in with £ 1,500 a week housing benefit handouts ( file picture ) the trendy white house in @entity28 asylum seeker @entity27 rented with housing benefit			1
right , the unemployed @entity31 immigrant answers the door in his pyjamas when most people would be at work single mother @entity36 who lives in a £ 1.2m @entity37 in @entity38 the handouts are allowing families to live in upmarket parts of @entity23 such as @entity22 , @entity42 and @entity43 alongside wealthy neighbours such as @entity45 and @entity46			1
the figures have been criticised by campaigners and raised concerns that the government 's plan to cap housing benefit is not being enforced			1
ministers announced last year that housing benefit , which currently costs the taxpayer £ 22billion every year , should be capped at £ 400 per week			1
however , the latest figures from the @entity12 show there are close to 5,000 families still claiming more than the £ 400 cap			1
although almost four out of every five people on housing benefit pick up less than £ 100 each week			1
public opinion has been riled by the cases of immigrants and asylum seekers who have been allowed to live in lavish flats at the expense of taxpayers			2
in 2010 it emerged that a family of @entity31 asylum seekers were getting £ 1.2m a year to live in @entity22 , @entity23 - a short walk from the @entity73 and @entity73 of @entity75 's new home in @entity76			1
nice wheels ... how did you get them ? @entity36 's son @entity79 , 21 , pulls up to the family 's £ 1.2million home in west @entity23 @entity27 , 42 , an unemployed bus conductor , his wife @entity82 , 40 , and their seven children moved to the three - storey home in the fashionable area of the capital after complaining that their previous home had been in a ' poor ' part of the city			1
in another case last year , a @entity31 family moved from a house in @entity95 to a £ 2m property in @entity97 , north @entity23			2

the figures will raise calls for the government 's benefit reforms to be bulldozed through the @entity123 - despite pleading from @entity124			2
the data , made public under the @entity126 , show the areas of the @entity128 that pay out the most in housing benefit are @entity130 ( £ 469million per year ) , @entity131 ( £ 337m ) , @entity132 ( £ 306m ) , @entity43 ( £ 281m ) , @entity133 ( £ 267m ) , @entity134 ( £ 264m ) , @entity135 ( £ 258m ) , @entity136 ( £ 254m ) , @entity137 ( £ 254m ) and @entity138 ( 248m )			1
@entity139 of the @entity140 said : ' this is further evidence that it is right to cap benefits			0
it is unfair to ask taxpayers to pay for swanky central @entity23 homes for others when they ca n't afford to live in those postcodes themselves			1
' many middle or low income families have to decide if they can afford to house their family in town , or if they have to move out to somewhere more affordable			0
it is not unreasonable to ask those on benefits to make the same choice			0
' the @entity12 says the new rules which have been put in place mean that those families currently getting more than £ 400 - per - week will be gradually taken out of the system and moved into cheaper accommodation			2
a spokesman added : ' these figures underline exactly why our @entity165 reforms are so necessary ' .			0
