the @entity0 are not living up to their promise of fresh transparency under a new regime by keeping secret the job description for the director of @entity8 cricket			1
the confidential details were sent by email to potential candidates for the post , front - runners for which are former @entity8 captains @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
but the work parameters will not appear on the @entity0 website or that of headhunters @entity23 , as would be the normal procedure			2
@entity0 chairman @entity25 has released very few details of the new director of cricket role for @entity8 former @entity8 captain @entity16 ( pictured here in 2011 ) is among the front - runners for the job it is understood the @entity0 , who say there will be a proper recruitment procedure , do n't want any publicity about the job specification			1
it might well be altered in various ways during the interview process so their chosen man is happy with the scope of his responsibilities			0
it is not expected that the new appointment will have to go to every @entity8 game			0
that will please head coach @entity48 , who talked of the danger of having too many voices in the dressing room after the @entity52			0
but the cricket director will have the main say over coach and captain and set the overall playing strategy			2
sports psychiatrist @entity58 , who is credited with having helped @entity59 recover from situational anxieties well enough for him to return to the @entity52 arena , talked briefly this week about how he is aiding the @entity8 batsman			1
@entity8 star @entity59 has overcome situational anxieties following work with psychiatrist @entity58 @entity58 , before giving a lecture on his role as undergraduate dean of the @entity69 medical school , said he was n't equipped to give guidance on the technical batting problems that led to @entity59 's two failures in @entity73			1
but he concentrates on ensuring , through @entity75 sessions , that @entity59 is in the best state of mind to succeed while being able to put any cricket setback into proper perspective			2
@entity80 manager @entity79 appears to have enjoyed yet another big payday by fronting a @entity83 promotion of their new car supply deal for the @entity85			1
@entity79 , who was shown around the @entity86 by chairman - in - waiting and fellow @entity83 ambassador @entity88 , is a tennis fan who goes to the @entity91 finals at the @entity92 and counts @entity93 as a friend , even inviting him to @entity80 matches			1
@entity80 manager @entity79 has begun fronting a new promotional campaign on behalf of @entity83 it has emerged that @entity98 , the @entity99 media mogul chosen as chief executive of golf 's @entity101 , was not the only non-european in the running			1
so was the second choice , and there was also an @entity107 on the short - list			0
the message seems to have been that the @entity101 did n't want to antagonise the rest of @entity111 by appointing another @entity112 following the long , successful reigns of @entity114 and @entity115			0
however , @entity98 , despite his lack of golf knowledge , is seen as a good appointment , mainly because of his tv rights acumen			0
@entity98 ( right ) @entity121 going to pot ? five - time world snooker champion @entity121 , who has suffered from depression and missed most of the 2012 - 13 season with personal issues , does n't seem to be in the best frame of mind ahead of this year 's @entity128 judging by a call he made while on the @entity132 - @entity131 train last saturday			2
@entity121 leans across the table as he lines up a shot during the first round of the @entity136 @entity137 , who leads debutant @entity139 7 - 2 in his first - round match , was overhead saying that he was n't happy and was ready to retire again			0
@entity121 said in hearing of around 10 passengers travelling in the same first - class carriage : ' it 's no good			0
i do n't need any of this			0
i 've got my @entity148 work , i 've got money			0
i only came back to revive my career			0
@entity151 , the greatest ever jump jockey who retires from riding at @entity153 on saturday , has an open offer to join @entity155 , who would greatly benefit from his stardust			1
but @entity151 , although sure to make occasional tv appearances , is more likely to work inside @entity160 ' racing empire			2
legendary jockey @entity151 is set to retire from racing on saturday and could now pursue punditry with so many @entity164 clubs having absentee owners , it 's refreshing to hear that @entity166 , the 95 - year - old mother of @entity168 majority shareholder @entity167 , still regularly attends games at @entity170 .			1

the @entity0 are creating a new director of cricket role as part of a *restructure* after the departure of @entity8 's managing director @entity177
however , they have released very few details as to the job description
@entity59 is back in the @entity8 set - up following *treatment* from leading sports psychiatrist @entity58
@entity80 manager @entity79 is fronting a new promotional deal with car *manufacturers* @entity83
legendary jockey @entity151 , is set to retire from racing on saturday
