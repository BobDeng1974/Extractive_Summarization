when @entity1 was alerted to a thief making a run for it with two stolen laptops he could have dialled 999 or pretended not to have noticed			1
but instead he doggedly pursued the suspect through the streets for over a mile in his bare feet before cornering him			2
the determined 18 - year - old college student ran so fast and over such gruelling terrain that his feet were left ‘ shredded ’ by the 15 - minute chase and resembled ‘ lumps of sirloin steak ’			1
@entity1 , right , pictured with his father @entity15 , left , was on crutches for three months folllowing the chase the brave teenager , who suffers from cystic fibrosis , later spent months on crutches and has undergone intensive physiotherapy to begin walking again			1

he ran his foot , literally , to the bone , the court was told			2
last night , the teenager shrugged off his heroic intervention and told how he thought only of catching the culprit			0
‘ it was just adrenalin , really , ’ he said			0
‘ i did n’t even think about not having shoes on			0
‘ my dad shouted for help to chase him , so i did			2
‘ i had no idea about the state of my feet until my dad pointed it out			0
‘ i looked down and could n’t believe it			0
that ’s when it started to hurt			0
i hobbled home and my dad continued the chase			2

@entity43 had struck moments earlier at a home in an adjoining street in @entity62 , @entity63 , and had been disturbed by the householder who gave chase , the court was told			1
the homeowner managed to corner @entity43 but the raider shoved him out of the way and fled with the two computers in bags			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ a man came running into the close , and to all intents and purposes it looked like he was out jogging			1
‘ but a few seconds later , a taxi came screeching up after him			0
i thought it was someone running away from a fare			0
‘ the guy ( in the taxi ) shouted ‘ he ’s robbed my house and stole my lap - top ’ , so i gave chase with the taxi driver and shouted my son to help			2
‘ we chased him for about ten minutes and when @entity1 flushed him out of a garden , i realised he had nothing on his feet			1
‘ @entity1 chased him so far but then started limping badly and i saw his feet			1
the soles were shredded , almost to the bone			0
