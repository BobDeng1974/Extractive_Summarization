published : 13:31 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 14:28 est , 2 december 2013 a father and son have created their own @entity2 with seven foot stones on their family farm			1
the stone arrangement , which includes rocks weighing up to two tonnes , was erected by @entity8 and his son @entity9 on their estate in @entity12 , @entity13			1
but the history enthusiasts have been bombarded by confused tourists asking which century the arrangement dates back to after they put the stones on display six months ago			2
unique garden display : @entity8 and his son @entity9 have built their very own @entity20 on the grounds of their family farm in @entity12 , @entity13 @entity9 said : ' quite often we ’d come back from work and there would be a walker stood there , looking at his @entity31 map , scratching his head			1
' we ’d stop and have a bit of a chat and they ’d ask if this was an ancient place of worship			0
i ’d say my ancestors built it - my father put it up six months ago			0
' both my father and i have a real interest in local history and my headmaster was well - known rock art expert , @entity45			0
' every single lesson he would revert back to talking about stone circles , so i blame him for my interest			2
' unusual : tourists visiting @entity12 , @entity13 , have been left baffled by the display @entity9 and @entity8 have received calls and emails from history societies across the country , who have been questioned by tourists over the historical nature of the stones			1
' to the untrained eye the stones could be mistaken for being a lot older , ' said @entity9			1
' but when you look closely you can tell they ’ve been quarried in the last few years			0
' as early as 3300 bc , arrangements of standing stones began to be erected around @entity65			0
the most famous is @entity20 in @entity66			2
but contrary to popular belief , @entity20 was not built by the @entity68			2
it is believed that construction of @entity20 started in 2600 bc and was completed in 2000 bc. heavy work : some of the stones are up to seven feet tall and weigh up to two tonnes but some more outlandish theorists claim the stones are @entity75 landing pads or observatories for a highly evolved class of astronomer priests			1
all experts agree that stone circles are of pre-christian date , but beyond that stone circles have proven difficult to date accurately			0
dubbed @entity12 ’s very own @entity20 , @entity9 says his stone circle has a number of fundamental differences to the famous @entity86			1
he said : ' we ’ve got no objections to people asking if they can sit on the stones , have a cup of tea , and eat their picnics			0
' my friends who own farms nearby and have a sense of humour like myself , quite fancy a stone circle for themselves			0
