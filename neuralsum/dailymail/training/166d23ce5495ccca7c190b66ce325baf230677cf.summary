by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 18:02 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 18:29 est , 30 october 2013 a long - lost @entity4 film has finally had its @entity5 premiere some 75 years after the unfinished silent movie was produced by the cinema genius			1
@entity8 , which pre-dates his masterpiece debut @entity4 , was recently discovered in an @entity12 warehouse and had its first ever @entity5 screening in @entity14 , @entity15 on october 16			1
the film was supposed to accompany a stage production of a @entity19 play and stars @entity20 - who was to collaborate with @entity4 again in the 1941 @entity21 and again in 1949 's @entity22			1
the play opened without the film in august 1938 and flopped			2
@entity12 film archivists announced in august that a copy of ' @entity8 originally believed destroyed in a fire had been found in a box by a shipping company in @entity49 , a northeastern @entity12 city that 's home to the @entity52 silent film festival where the film had it global premier earlier this month			1
the film was turned over to a local film society , but the find seemed of no particular value and was left unopened for many years			2
@entity60 , an @entity12 expert on @entity4 , identified the film about three years ago			1
the only remaining copy was believed to have been burned up in a 1970 fire that destroyed @entity4 ' home in @entity65 , @entity34			0
how the film arrived in @entity49 remains a mystery			0
the film was supposed to accompany a stage production of a @entity19 play , but the play opened without the film in august 1938 and flopped film accompaniment : @entity4 wanted his 40 - minute , three - act film to be prologues for the three acts of a @entity19 play he was putting on at the @entity77 ' this is by far the most important film restoration by @entity38 in a very long time , ' said @entity80 , senior curator of film , who supervised the project			1
' holding in one 's hands the very same print that had been personally edited by @entity4 75 years ago provokes an emotion that 's just impossible to describe			1
' @entity4 made the silent slapstick comedy in @entity15 shortly before heading to @entity27 to film @entity21 , considered by many critics to be the best movie ever made			1
@entity8 , filmed in 1938 , has nowhere near the complexity of @entity21 or the tense thrills of @entity22 but offers a never - before - seen glimpse at the skills of one of cinema 's greats			2
it had never been shown in public and was at one time lost to @entity4 himself , who expressed his shock at finding a copy in storage at his home near @entity65 , @entity34			0
it was this copy of the film , which most experts agreed was the only copy , that was destroyed in a fire at @entity4 's home in the 1970s			0
the film was designed to run for 40 minutes , with 20 minutes devoted to the play 's prologue and two 10 - minute introductions for the second and third act but a virtually pristine print was recently discovered in an @entity12 warehouse , and has now been restored by @entity38			1
the film was not intended to stand by itself , but was designed as the cinematic aspect of @entity4 's @entity77 stage presentation of @entity19 's 1894 comedy			2
the play follows the fortunes of a @entity15 playboy who flees from the violent husband of his mistress and borrows the identity of a plantation owner in @entity127 - who is expecting the arrival of a mail - order bride			1
the film was designed to run for 40 minutes , with 20 minutes devoted to the play 's prologue and two 10 - minute introductions for the second and third act			2
welles wanted it to be a silent film in the tradition of the @entity139 slapstick comedies , in order to enhance the various chases , duels and comic conflicts of the @entity19 play			2
in addition - and typical of @entity4 's innovation - live music and live sound effects would be synchronized with the footage to provide a ' surround sound ' effect for the audience			0
but the film was never fully finished			0
it was anticipated that the play would be a flop and @entity4 let the film project die a natural death , putting the footage in storage			2
he recalled in a later interview that he was surprised to find a copy at his home , saying : ' i ca n't remember whether i had it all along and dug it out of the bottom of a trunk , or whether someone brought it to me , but there it was			0
long - time collaboration : the unseen film stars @entity20 - seen here with @entity4 in 1949 's @entity22			0
welles himself said @entity20 's performance was amazing , but nonetheless did not want the film shown publicly masterpiece : @entity21 - the 1941 film written , directed by and starring @entity4 - is widely regarded as the best film ever made ' i screened it , and it was in perfect condition , with not a scratch on it , as though it had only been through a projector once or twice before			1
it had a fine quality			0
' @entity20 was magnificent , and i immediately made plans to edit it and send it to @entity191 as a birthday present			0
but @entity4 never allowed the footage to be seen publicly , stating the film would not make sense outside of the full context of the @entity19 play the recent copy was found in a warehouse by the staff of @entity200			0
other @entity77 actors that appear in the film include @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity4 himself and his wife @entity208			0
the play opened without the film on august 16 , 1938 - and flopped			1
the unfinished nitrate work print was given by @entity200 to @entity12 film archive @entity212 , which transferred it to @entity38 to be preserved with a grant from the @entity216			1
@entity80 , senior curator of film , who supervised the project for @entity38 , said : ' this is by far the most important film restoration by @entity38 in a very long time			0
holding in one ’s hands the very same print that had been personally edited by @entity4 75 years ago provokes an emotion that ’s just impossible to describe			1
' despite the fact that it pre-dates @entity21 , even @entity8 is not @entity4 's directorial debut			0
in 1934 , while still attending the @entity226 , he co-directed ( with friend @entity227 ) a short avant garde film called the @entity229 .			0

too much @entity231 was made by the *famous* director prior to his 1941 masterpiece @entity21
it was intended to accompany a play , but the idea was *scrapped* and the film never completed
the extremely rare print was discovered several years ago in @entity12
75 years after it was made it had its @entity5 premiere in @entity14 , @entity15 , on oct 16
