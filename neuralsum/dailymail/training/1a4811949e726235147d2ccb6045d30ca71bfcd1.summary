@entity0 was still absorbing the impact of @entity3 ’s goal when lightning flashed over the @entity5 and the rumble of thunder drowned the sound of ‘ you ’re getting sacked in the morning ’			1
a storm is breaking over the @entity12 manager right now			2
another defeat reopens the debate over his future , not that the subject was ever really closed			0

@entity26 insists he was joking but the 1,751 in the away end , however , were not laughing on monday night			2
before a ball had been kicked they unfurled a ‘ @entity0 is a muppet ’ banner , while ‘ @entity40 ’ cards — left over from the 2 - 2 draw with @entity39 last weekend — were also scattered among the travelling contingent			1
@entity12 supporters display a banner calling for the removal of manager @entity0 @entity12 fans vent their anger at the club 's owner @entity26 during monday 's game at @entity25 @entity12 manager @entity0 acknowledges the travelling fans after the final whistle it was during this fixture last season , a 1 - 0 win for @entity25 in april , that fans rounded on @entity0			1
on that occasion , though , he was serving a touchline ban for butting @entity39 ’s @entity58 and so was spared their scorn on the walk from dugout to tunnel			0
there was no hiding last night and , on half - time , they called for his head as he passed in front of them			0
it is easy to see why			0

‘ it ’s been tough because you want the fans to be behind you			2
they are questioning everything i do and that ’s understandable , but i have to remain strong and makes sure i ’m giving the team everything i can			0
’ @entity0 ’s fortitude is academic , however			1
it is whether @entity26 is willing to remain strong in his support			0
