do you know someone inspirational ? the search for the 2013 winner is on the @entity4 is proudly running its seventh @entity5 , in association with @entity7 and the charity shelter			2
over the coming weeks , we want you to nominate the special women who deserve to be recognised			2
here , we tell the story of one of our remarkable nominees			2
@entity14 had barely switched out the light when the phone on her bedside table started ringing			1
a few hurried words and minutes later @entity14 , accompanied by husband @entity19 , was zooming off in her car on another mercy mission			1
this time , the crisis call came from 73 - year - old @entity23 , who had been frightened by a mysterious banging sound on her door			1
' @entity19 and i toured the property and could n't see anything , ' @entity14 smiles , recalling last week 's late - night outing			1
' it was probably simply a tree branch brushing against her door			2
but there was no way i could have just turned over and gone to sleep without checking			2
' i know @entity23 would have sat up in her chair all night scared out of her wits			2
and i could n't have that			2
after giving her a cuddle and making her a nice hot cup of cocoa , i helped her back into bed and knew she 'd sleep soundly			0
' is n't that what everyone would do ? ' always on call : @entity14 is available , day and night , for the elderly residents of @entity43 if only			1
this selfless approach is how @entity14 , 53 , came to be nominated for the @entity4 's @entity5 competition , run in association with @entity7 and the charity shelter			1
she was put forward for the award by the residents of @entity43 , a complex of sheltered housing for the elderly based in @entity53 , @entity54			1
as manager of the complex , which is home to 47 residents aged from 60 to 103 , who all live in their own self - contained bungalows , @entity14 is paid to work only from 9am to 5pm , five days a week			1
however , the elderly residents in @entity14 's care say that they can contact her any time on her landline or mobile phone and she will leave her home half a mile away at a moment 's notice if they need @entity69 they use an emergency panic button , the plea for help is directed to a call centre , but the call centre is under strict instructions to alert @entity14 immediately			1
' my residents trust me to be there for them , ' says @entity14 , who lives in @entity53 with @entity19 , 52 , who posts billboards for companies			1
' can you imagine how frightened they would be having paramedics turn up without me being there to comfort and reassure them ? ' if they have to go to hospital , i can pack a little bag for them and check they 've got all their medicine			0
' @entity90 come early : @entity14 with residents @entity91 and @entity93 ( left to right ) and granddaughter @entity94 , posing with a collection for @entity97 children and when any of her residents has a long spell in hospital , @entity14 is sure to turn up at their bedside with a hug and a cheery smile			1
' most managers sign off at 5pm every day , but that 's not good enough for @entity107 , ' explains @entity108 , 79 , one of the residents who has benefited many times from her kindness			1
' although she does n't live on site but a few minutes away , she gets in her car and comes rushing round if any of us has a problem			0
' she 's outstanding and we honestly do n't know what we would do without her			0
i 've got two replacement hips and knees			0
when i fell a few weeks ago and could n't get up again , i called @entity14			1
even though it was a saturday morning - her day off - she was here within ten minutes			1
' she stayed with me until the paramedics came and even accompanied me to hospital for a check - up because she knew i was scared			1
nothing 's too much trouble for her			1
' @entity14 , who worked as a childminder for 20 years before taking her job at @entity43 's in february 2010 , shrugs off the praise			1
' i genuinely love looking after my elderly people , ' she says			1
' and the fact i can make their lives more enjoyable makes me so happy			0
' i see it as my chance to give back a little			0
i treat my residents the way i 'd treat my own mum			2
i was very close to @entity140 - who lived at the complex herself for six years until she died of cancer in may 2007 aged 73			1
loyalty : ' my residents trust me to be there for them ' , says @entity14 , who is the manager of the complex ' we spoke every day and , when she died , there was a huge hole in my life			1
i 'd already lost my father , who died , also of cancer , when he was in his early 50s			0
' it may sound as though i do a lot , but i get back much more than i give			0
' looking after my lovely elderly ladies and gentlemen is like having a huge extended family			2
we laugh and we cry together - just like in a family			2
when someone dies , we are all down			0
and when someone has a birthday or a new grandchild , we all join in the celebrating			0
' of course , some have their own families and get regular visitors , but many do n't			0
when i say goodbye to them on friday evening , many wo n't see a soul until i come back on monday morning and that 's so sad			0
' @entity14 , who 's mum to @entity169 , 33 , @entity170 , 31 and @entity171 , 22 and grandma to @entity94 , 12 and @entity173 , three , starts every day with a roll call			1
' i pop around to each house with my register			0
it 's like checking who 's in class today , and we always have a good laugh about it			0
it 's a chance to chat about anything my ladies and gentlemen are worried about			0
i help them with everything from organising eye tests to helping with tricky knitting patterns			0
and with @entity107 around there 's absolutely no chance of the residents getting bored			2
the communal hall - which used to be deserted under the old manager - is now a hive of activity			1
there are ' knit and natter ' and craft mornings , @entity202 and bingo afternoons , and fish and chip suppers			0
going for gold : @entity14 holding the @entity53 in @entity207 residents enjoy an @entity209 , a @entity90 and regular cream teas just for the fun of it			1
money for treats is raised by the residents			2
' we do our own version of the @entity218 every week and there 's always a winner , ' explains @entity14			1
' @entity19 came up with the idea of each resident paying £ 1 and choosing their favourite numbers			0
they then have their house number tagged on			0
' it means someone wins every week			2
we all get excited for the winner , who gets to keep £ 40 , and we put money left over - £ 9 a week - into the kitty			1
' at weekends there are often trips out			0
recently , @entity14 piled 25 residents into a minibus and , with husband @entity19 bringing up the rear in his car , they all set off for a day at the dog races in @entity239 , followed by lunch and a drive along the seafront			1
' all the wheelchairs and @entity245 frames take some managing , ' @entity14 grins			1
' but getting out and having fun is a tonic for everyone - me included			2
' @entity14 makes a point of remembering all her residents ' birthdays and she buys them all @entity90 presents - diaries for the ladies and liqueur chocolates for the men			1
needless to say she 's inundated with cards and gifts when it comes to her own birthday			0
dedication : @entity14 helping to clean out the fish pond in the residents ' complex ' i try to keep the date secret , but they always find out somehow			1
last year i got 40 cards and more boxes of chocolates than i could possibly eat , ' she laughs			0
but while the residents love @entity107 for her unstinting energy and good humour , it 's her willingness to step in day or night that is truly exceptional			2
when @entity279 , 85 , was diagnosed with terminal cancer she wanted to stay at home as long as possible			0
with @entity279 's children living too far away to help their mother , her gp was reluctant to let her stay at home , and it was only when @entity14 offered to help @entity279 's 90 - year - old husband @entity278 care for her that she was allowed to remain in the home she loved			1
with the help of the @entity290 nurses who called in regularly , @entity14 was able to fulfil @entity279 's wishes			1
' i was on call 24/7			2
i do n't think i got an undisturbed night for two weeks			0
but i honestly did n't mind , ' says @entity14			1
' @entity279 only went into hospital at the very end			0
' when the hospital rang me at 6am to say she was dying , i got @entity278 up and dressed and we drove over there together			0
although we arrived just too late and cried in each other 's arms , the comfort @entity278 got from knowing he had done all his wife wanted was enormous			0
' i was so pleased that i was able to help it happen			0
my residents have cared for others all their lives			2
now it 's their turn to be cared for			0
