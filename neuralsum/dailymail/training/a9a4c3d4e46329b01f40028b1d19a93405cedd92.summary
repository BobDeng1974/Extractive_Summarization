' the kimono that geisha wear are also works of art. and being able to work by performing is wonderful			0
' @entity0 's speciality is playing the bamboo flute , as one of the main part of being a geisha is learning an art. ' i had to begin with dance , drum and tea ceremony lessons			2
i had to abandon some of these later when my father got terminal cancer , ' @entity0 said			2
' instead , i practiced the things i could do while helping to look after him for weeks at a time - shamisen ( 3 string lute ) and singing , and i still do those , ' she said			0
