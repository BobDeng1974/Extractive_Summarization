tortured : @entity0 said he was hung from a wall and kept in isolation damning claims have emerged that @entity4 helped send a terror suspect into the bloody hands of @entity7			1
a secret letter found in an abandoned @entity10 government building appears to show that @entity11 provided intelligence which led to the ‘ rendition ’ of a @entity10 dissident who was then tortured horrifically			1
@entity0 , who by a bitter irony is now a senior military commander in the rebel army , last night claimed @entity4 agents were among the first to question him in @entity18 , adding that he was very ‘ surprised that the @entity4 got involved in what was a very painful period in my life ’			2
he said : ‘ i was n’t allowed a bath for three years and i did n’t see the sun for one year			1
' they hung me from the wall and kept me in an isolation cell			1
’ astonishingly , the letter ’s author appears desperate to take credit for @entity4 ’s role , and fawning in his attitude to @entity33 , @entity7 ’s intelligence chief who was known as the regime ’s ‘ envoy of death ’			1
he writes : ‘ this was the least we could do for you and for @entity10 to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over recent years			1
’ the letter lays bare the startlingly close relationship between @entity4 spies and senior figures in the @entity7 regime , and raises serious questions about whether the @entity4 helped in one of the most controversial elements of the @entity50 ‘ war on terror ’ – the illegal movement of prisoners around the world			2
the explosive letter was among hundreds of documents found abandoned by campaign group @entity56 on friday in the offices formerly occupied by @entity33 as head of the @entity10 foreign ministry			1
their authenticity has not been officially confirmed			0
headlined ‘ for @entity33 in @entity18 from @entity63 in @entity64 ’ , the letter about @entity0 is thought to have been written by sir @entity65 , @entity11 ’s then counter-terrorism chief , who now works for @entity66			1
it was written days before @entity68 arrived in @entity18 for the notorious ‘ @entity69 ’ in march 2004			0
in the letter , the writer discusses the arrangements for the @entity74 ’s visit , including the suggestion that @entity76 wanted mr @entity68 and the @entity10 leader to appear in a tent together because the image would appeal to the @entity4 public			1
alarmingly , at the end of the letter he congratulates @entity33 on the arrival of mr @entity0 , who @entity56 said is also known as @entity84 , and appears to indicate the rendition was carried out by the @entity50 on the basis of @entity4 intelligence			1
there is no suggestion , however , that @entity4 was directly involved in the operation to capture him			0
hug for a monster : former prime minster @entity68 with @entity7 in @entity94 , @entity10 in 2007 taking clear credit for the fact that @entity0 is in @entity10 custody , he writes : ‘ i am so glad			1
i was grateful to you for helping the officer we sent out last week			0
@entity84 ’s information on the situation in this country is of urgent importance to us			0
’ he also boasts of keeping the @entity50 in the dark and dealing with @entity33 directly , and refers to the prisoner as ‘ air cargo ’			0
he added : ‘ amusingly , we got a request from the @entity50 to channel requests for information from @entity84 through the @entity50			0
i have no intention of doing any such thing			0
‘ the intelligence about @entity84 was @entity4			2
i know i did not pay for the air cargo			0
but i feel i have the right to deal with you direct on this and am very grateful to you for the help you are giving us			0
’ last night the leading human rights lawyer @entity122 said the documents should be passed to the @entity125 inquiry which is considering allegations of @entity4 complicity in torture			0
he said : ‘ @entity11 were entirely right to have dealings with @entity10 intelligence in 2004 to obtain information			1
but they had no right to assist @entity7 ’s regime by illegal rendition – putting dissidents in the hands of a brutal agency that was well known to use torture and murder			0
’ the documents show how @entity4 intelligence led to @entity0 being captured in @entity142 on in march 2004			1
@entity11 knew of his whereabouts because @entity0 was attempting to seek asylum in the @entity4			1
documents show that five days before he was taken back to @entity18 , @entity11 gave @entity149 ’s @entity147 and @entity148 aliases , and told them he was in detention in @entity151 , @entity152			1
the papers also suggest that there were at least eight occasions when the @entity156 sent terrorism suspects for questioning in @entity10			2
other documents expose how sir @entity63 flattered the @entity10 spy chief , at one point thanking him for ‘ a large volume of dates and oranges ’			2
@entity165 also sent @entity167 greetings , helped obtain telephone numbers and details of @entity10 dissidents in the @entity4 , the documents suggest			2
@entity33 , who fled the regime with the assistance of @entity11 in february , came to the @entity4 and is now thought to be in the @entity173			2
last night the @entity174 appeared to confirm they were genuine when a spokesman said : ‘ it is the government ’s longstanding policy not to comment on intelligence matters			0
‘ nor would we comment on leaked @entity4 documents			0
’ sir @entity63 did not respond to requests for comment			0
a @entity66 spokesman declined to comment .			0

letter appears to show @entity11 provided intelligence which led to the ' rendition ' of a @entity10 dissident
@entity0 said he was *n't* allowed a bath for three years and was kept in an isolation cell
