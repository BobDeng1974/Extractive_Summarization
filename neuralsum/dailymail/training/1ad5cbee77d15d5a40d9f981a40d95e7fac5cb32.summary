watching your weight does not include eating large bowls of pasta			1
but if you thought such things were off the menu , you might want to think again			0
makers of the spiralizer — a new kitchen gadget that is taking @entity9 by storm — claim you can create nutritious , very low - calorie , low - carb ‘ pasta ’ , ‘ noodles ’ and ‘ rice ’ from everyday fruit and vegetables , in less time than it takes to peel a spud			1
according to @entity9 food bloggers , this magic machine can spin a simple courgette into a generous bowl of ‘ spaghetti ’ in a flash			1
spiralize a sweet potato and in minutes you ’ll apparently get a filling portion of ‘ rice ’ with just half the calories and carbs of regular basmati			1
it seems that spiralizing still has some way to go before it catches on here , however			0
my local cookware shops in @entity55 , and even the @entity57 website , drew a blank			0
i eventually found one — a @entity60 , by @entity61 — online , for £ 25 on @entity62 , including free delivery			0
three days later the lightweight , dishwasher - proof machine arrived , with three confusing - looking interchangeable blades			1
but six simple step - by - step instructions later , i was ready to crank the handle			1
to begin , i pressed the legs of the machine down firmly on a flat surface to allow the suction cups on to hold it in position			0
next , i had to choose what to spiralize			0
firm fruit and vegetables work best , which means that berries , citrus fruits and avocados are out			1
carrot , sweet potato and pear are all good choices but courgette is a favourite , as it creates such delicious ‘ pasta ’			1
oodles of noodles : @entity91 's first attempt was courgette spaghetti simply impale your vegetable between the spiked disc and the slicing blade — pushing it forward with one hand while turning the handle at the back of the machine with the other — and you ’ll be quickly rewarded with a neat tumble of veggie ‘ spaghetti ’			1
no chopping or coring is required			0
my first recipe attempt , then , was courgette spaghetti , a favourite on websites because of its low calorie content — a 125g portion of raw courgette spaghetti contains 21 calories and less than 4g of carbohydrate , compared with 346 calories and 64g of carbohydrate for normal spaghetti			1
one large peeled courgette , put through the spiralizer , makes enough for one person			1
after blanching the spirals for a minute or two in boiling water — you can salt them if you wish — i drained them and plopped on a generous dollop of our family ’s home - made bolognese sauce			1
my children were nodding eagerly until , roughly five minutes after serving , their meals began to bleed			2
@entity136 , it seems , have an exceptionally high water content of roughly 95 per cent , and once they were sitting on a plate that moisture was released , turning dinner into more of a bolognese soup			0
@entity143 , my next challenge was a spiralized ‘ noodle ’ stir - fry — one large carrot , a medium courgette and half an onion per person , spiralized and stir - fried with four beaten eggs and a splash of soy sauce to make four 150 - calorie meals			1
although hungry , the children were now sceptical			0
but @entity45 was first to pronounce it a success : ‘ @entity160 , this is gor - geous , ’ she cooed , before they both cleared their plates			2
just like the real thing ? @entity163 says that carbs should not be competely cut from our diets the next day i was practically aglow with ideas			2
i began with breakfast : ribbons of pear with a blob of @entity173 yoghurt , a sprinkle of walnuts and a dash of honey — around 170 calories in total			0
for lunch i tried something lighter — a raw salad of half a beetroot with a large raw carrot , half a courgette and half a cucumber ‘ noodles ’			2
in just under 15 minutes i had whizzed them through the blade , leaving the two beetroot until last as — be wary — they spatter slightly			0
i splashed on some balsamic dressing and it tasted fresh and zingy — and all with just 140 calories			0
@entity45 and @entity44 now demanded spiralized suppers			0
their favourite treat is curly fries , so i tried to make them with sweet potato			0
leaving the potatoes unpeeled for extra fibre , one medium potato made enough for one person			0
i splashed the freshly made coils with olive oil and baked them in a hot oven for about 20 @entity210 , the finer edges of the springs burnt too quickly while the coiled parts remained underdone			0
next i found the recipe for sweet potato ‘ rice ’ , which requires chopping the spiralized potatoes in a food processor until they resemble rice grains			2
i fried a few cloves of chopped garlic and half an onion before adding my sweet potato rice and poaching it in chicken stock for two minutes			2
a quick sieve and i had an orange - coloured ‘ risotto ’			2
best of all , it contained only 107 calories and 25g of carbohydrates per portion ( compared with 183 calories and 37.5g carbs in basmati )			2
but is it really prudent to remove significant amounts of carbs from a family ’s diet ? seeing spirals : @entity91 tries out the spiralizer on beetroot , carrots , courgette and cucumber dietitian @entity244 says : ‘ it ’s definitely not a good idea to eliminate carbohydrates from the diet entirely , as they are a food group that provides us with a range of important nutrients			1
‘ that said , many of us do tend to overload our plates with pasta , rice , bread and potatoes when they are on offer			1
a well - balanced meal should be a quarter protein , a quarter carbohydrate and half fruit and vegetables , so the spiralizer could play a really useful role in redressing the nutritional balance in a carb - heavy diet			1
’ there is very little room in the back of my cupboards for yet another faddy gadget to gather dust			2
but i think this little gizmo may just have earned a permanent place on my kitchen counter			0

the spiralizer turns fruit and veg into low - carb ' pasta ' , ' noodles ' and ' rice '
this new gadget is taking @entity9 by storm
@entity295 tried to create family *friendly* meals using this nifty *device*
however *experts* warn we should *n't* eliminate carbs from our diet entirely
