by @entity0 it has n't all been plain sailing for a couple who set off on a yacht to travel the world with their three - year - old , after they confessed she had turned into a ' hell child ' on board			1
@entity13 and @entity14 gave up their jobs and home to begin a three - year tour of the world on a 56ft boat with their daughter @entity21			1
but @entity13 has admitted the youngster has taken badly to life on the ocean wave with constant tantrums and crying during the first three months			1
setting sail : @entity28 considered turning back from the three - year family adventure after her daughter @entity21 turned into a ' hell child ' the 39 year - old wrote on her blog : ' with so many things on my mind , i did n't think about whether or not my daughter @entity21 would be able to cope with the massive change of lifestyle			1
' i did n't think that the lack of routine , unpredictability of sailing and inability to have control over daily events would cause behaviour issues			0
' i also failed to consider how she 'd take to playing alone			0
' up until living on a boat , my daughter always had many friends to play with in addition to having grandad next door			0
she was never alone and never had to play by herself			0
' young adventurer : @entity13 admitted that some criticised her decision to take @entity21 to sea while she is so young - and said there had been temper tantrums @entity13 and husband @entity14 , 47 , gave up their jobs last year and sold their six - bedroom home in @entity64 , @entity65 to fund their quest			1
@entity14 had taught @entity68 in a prison and @entity13 ran currency exchange and property businesses			1
@entity13 had previously admitted she felt there was an air of condemnation about their decision to take their daughter to sea , with some people worrying about health and safety and potential medical problems			1
they set off from @entity84 in march on the first leg of their odyssey aboard ' @entity88 ' and will begin by travelling the @entity89			0
in november they plan to make the 3,000 - mile crossing over the @entity92 to the @entity93			0
they plan to educate @entity21 on their travels and say their boat will be well stocked with medical supplies in case of emergency			2
but @entity21 's behaviour left them considering a return to the @entity103 until they found help in the form of a book on parenting which they have downloaded			1
family at sea : @entity14 was a pe teacher for under 21s at @entity113 before giving up his job to make his dreams of a round - the - world adventure come true @entity13 , who grew up @entity117 , said : ' by month three into our travels and after peeing on the floor , spitting , punching me , kicking me , biting my arms ( drawing blood ) and smashing a plate i was at my wits ' end			1
' after discussing things with my cousin , we decided that the best word for her behaviour was ' defiant			0
' ' every day we 'd have more blow - outs , more tantrums and more tears - and @entity21 was n't the only one crying			1
' i spent several days up on deck crying while @entity21 was down below screaming her lungs out			2
' the couple tried taking away the toddler 's toys and even her favourite blanket - but her behaviour continued to get worse			1
@entity13 said : ' i could n't help but think i must be a terrible parent			2
i thought perhaps i 'm not consistent enough , maybe i 'm too soft or perhaps too hard ? ' maybe i 'm not applying punishments appropriately			0
then i thought it 's not just me it 's the situation we are in			0
' at first , and in dramatic fashion , i thought that life on the sea was n't going to work for @entity21			2
she just was n't handling the transition			0
' i felt " woe is me , " and wanted to cry out that my life is finally a dream come true except for the fact that my daughter has turned into a hell child			2
' sea legs : @entity157 's behaviour has improved since @entity13 found a parenting book online which gave useful advice @entity13 said the parental advice book had helped calm things on board			1
she added : ' after reading only a few chapters i immediately perceived the whole situation in a different light and went about changing my behaviour			0
' thankfully since that major bust - up that ended with my arm bleeding and a smashed plate we have n't had another explosion			0
' yes we 've had crying and upsets but we have n't had any kicking , punching , biting , spitting or weeing again			0
' the family are currently sailing through the islands of @entity176 and their progress can be tracked on a website regularly updated by @entity13			2
@entity13 added : ' this journey is also about gaining a deeper connection to my family and learning how to be the best mom i can be			0
' on board : @entity14 and @entity13 set sail from @entity84 and are currently exploring the @entity176 islands before crossing the @entity92 later this year			1

@entity13 and @entity14 are aiming to spend three years sailing the world

@entity13 admitted they had considered returning *due* to daughter 's tantrums
