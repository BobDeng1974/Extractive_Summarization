@entity0 are relishing a rare chance to focus on attack against the @entity3 , according to manager @entity4			1
@entity4 's side do not go into many matches with a heavy expectation of victory but saturday 's home clash against a side ranked 179th in the world , nestling neatly between @entity12 and the @entity13 , is one such occasion			1
expectations are even loftier given last month 's impressive 2 - 1 away win over @entity17 in their first @entity19 qualifier , but @entity4 accepts this will be a much different challenge			1
manager @entity4 leads a training session at @entity22 , @entity23 on friday @entity24 ( centre ) is one of the @entity27 players relishing the chance for all - out attack he will ask , as always , for defensive rigour and tactical discipline but has tailored this week 's training sessions firmly towards breaking down the opposition rather than holding them off at the other end			1
and it is a shift in emphasis that has gone down well in the squad			2
' there has been a lot of focus on our attacking play especially , our approach has been slightly different , ' he said			2
' obviously when you are doing attacking play the players enjoy it more than the other side of the game so it 's been a really good week			1
the mood in the camp is excellent			2
' we anticipate having more possession than we have had in our recent away games and given that we will have more possession we hope to turn that into opportunities			2
' you just ca n't go out and play off the cuff and play in a cavalier fashion			2
but our attacking players often have to do a lot of work off the ball			0
this is an opportunity to show the other side to their game			1
' @entity68 stretches during friday 's training session , ahead of @entity0 's match on saturday @entity71 ( left ) and @entity72 ( right ) discuss the sharp fall off at the side of the @entity22 pitch the game also represents a first home fixture for @entity0 in 13 months , during which time @entity4 's squad have played eight successive away games and racked up 34,000 air miles			1
home comforts may be hard to come by at @entity22 though , with two stands having been demolished as part of the ongoing redevelopment			1
capacity has been reduced to 10,500 as a result but @entity4 is more interested in the new and improved playing surface			1
' the pitch is always the priority for me			0
the surroundings pale into insignificance if i 'm honest and i think the players certainly enjoyed the training on it , ' he said			0
@entity24 scored a pivotal goal in @entity0 's last @entity19 qualifier against @entity17 @entity4 looks on ( left ) as his players train at @entity22 on friday , ahead of their @entity3 clash ' i do n't think the surroundings will be a huge factor on the game			1
once the game starts i think the players will be focused on what is going on on the pitch			1
' i still think there will be a great atmosphere			0
the stadium is sold out and the backing of the fans will be huge for us on a night when the expectation is higher than it has been and we have to rise to that			0
' @entity0 conspicuously failed to put away the lower ranked sides in @entity119 qualifying , taking a miserable two points from 12 against @entity121 and @entity122			1
a 4 - 0 win against the @entity124 on their last visit to @entity23 in 2011 offers more reason for cheer , but @entity4 is not focused on past results			1
@entity24 celebrates after scoring against @entity17 on september 7 in @entity129 @entity4 confers with his assistants , @entity131 ( left ) and @entity132 ( right ) ' i do n't think we can dwell on that , ' he said			1
' if you go back down the years there is always different groups of players and they know none of these games are straightforward			0
' we have to play as well as we did in @entity129 and with the same intensity and quality			0
' and captain @entity144 also expects the side to learn from the mistakes of the past by beating the @entity3 on saturday			1
' i think we need to learn from the mistakes we have made in the past in games like this because we know we are capable of getting a result , ' he said			0
' i think we have to be disciplined			0
i think in the past we have got a bit ragged and lost our way so it 's about using that experience and putting it into practice			1
' i do n't think it is a case of not being able to cope with it ( being favourite )			0
players are playing at clubs where there is expectation placed on them all the time			0
@entity167 ( centre ) leads the players during a session on october 10 in @entity23 ' it is all about showing that and there is a real determination in the squad to get the three points			0
' it wo n't be easy but if we do n't come off with three points we will feel as if we have failed and we do n't want that to happen			0
' @entity144 admitted to watching @entity182 brush aside @entity183 5 - 0 on thursday night as inspiration for the task ahead , but he realises the @entity124 will expect to be more competitive than that in @entity23 and is not expecting a similar goal - rush			2
' i saw the majority of the @entity182 game and you can see at this level you will always come up against a team who are well organised , ' he said			2
' we expect the @entity124 to be disciplined and i 'm sure they will see this as an opportunity to get something as well , judging by their past results against some of the smaller nations			0
' we are n't good enough to get carried away			0
we know our limitations and we know how we need to play and the effort we need to put in to get results , no matter who that is against			0
we need to be at it every game and get a bit of luck along the way			2
