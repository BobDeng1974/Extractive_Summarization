she is the £ 10m poster girl for real women whose curves have been voted as second only to @entity3			0
but it 's not just her curves that take the crown when it comes to the public 's love of @entity10			2
the most famous girl - next - door in @entity12 regularly tops best hair , smile and all - round beauty polls too			2
famed for her rosy cheeks , plump lips and smokey eyes , @entity10 's natural beauty is the envy of women worldwide			1
and while she can afford the most lavish products on the market , the @entity23 presenter has shared her beauty secrets with @entity27 - and fans will be delighted to know that most of them come in at under £ 10			2
' i 've got a really amazing body wash at the moment , it 's a @entity46 2 day moisture shower oil and that 's really good because when i get out of the shower i do n't have to moisturise so that really works , ' she said			1
as for her glowing skin , @entity10 swears by face and body exfoliators			1
she said : ' i love @entity54 's @entity55 & @entity56 , i love the smell of it in the morning when i wake up and it 's really good at taking off those lasting bits of make - up at the end of the day			1
budget beauty : she may be able to afford the most lavish products , but fans will be delighted to know that most of her beauty secrets are under £ 10 ' i also love the @entity65 , i use a lot of body scrubs just because i think it keeps your skin more even - toned , especially in the summer			1
' i think people are fearful of them because they think " oh no , it 's going to scrub off the suntan " but i think it keeps your skin looking all nice			2
' as for her luscious lips she explained that a good lip balm like a @entity80 lip balm is very important because she is constantly putting lipstick on and off and being under the light whilst filming really dries her lips out			0
the mother - of - two also swears by @entity85 for her lips and even to help heal cuts and grazes			1
speaking about her beauty regime before a big night out with her friends , she said : ' for a night out with friends i love a big flicked eye			1
' i like to have an eyeliner that 's almost like a felt tip pen because i just find it really easy to control ; @entity96 do a really good one			1
' i use loads of mascara and maybe an eyelash			0
i have had to practise for a really long time to put those on though			0
' she added : ' it depends where i 'm going but if i want to vamp it up and go for a red lip then my favourite is @entity107 or @entity108 , which is a really nice pinky nude colour			0
' @entity10 was recently voted as having the best celebrity smile , with dentists even claiming that many patients actively request the pearly whites of 32 - year - old @entity114 when having whitening treatments			0
but what 's the secret behind her @entity119 smile ? ' being on telly and saying " good morning " , the first thing people see is your smile and having a white , bright , shiny smile is really important to me and my job			1
' so @entity35 @entity34 is a brilliant toothpaste because it keeps the dentist happy by beating tartar and the important things but it makes me happy because it keeps my teeth white , which is just what i need and how i like them , ' she revealed			0
while she is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful people in the public eye , @entity10 admires the looks of two very different looking women			0
@entity10 's secrets : ( @entity142 ) @entity143 , £ 6.99 , @entity144 & @entity56 , £ 14.75 , @entity107 @entity108 , £ 15 get her look : @entity10 swears by @entity147 toothpaste and @entity96 's @entity148 , £ 22 she said : ' there are so many gorgeous beautiful women out there but different women for different things			1
' i look at @entity154 and think she is a really mysterious dark sex goddess and a beautiful woman who is committed to her look , and she looks so feminine and striking so i really admire her for that			2
' but then on the flip - side , i love the look of someone like @entity161 who probably looks the exact same when she gets out of bed in the morning			2
' she probably does n't have to put any make - up on and she has this really fresh , beautiful face and she is just effortlessly natural			0
' idols : @entity10 loves @entity154 's ' sex goddess ' look and @entity161 's natural looks @entity10 is currently busy as a presenter on this morning , has just released a children 's book with her sister and is working with very on her clothing range , but she still has big plans for the future			1

i really love that side of things			0
i love getting a new product and thinking : " ooh how does this one work ? " ' but i do have my favourite things that i use over and over again			0
i 'm not really very experimental with changing things up so would i ? ' i think it 's more down to a time issue with me			0
i have enough on my plate as it is and i want to do the things i 'm committed to as well as i possibly can so maybe in the future but not right now			0
' the future 's bright : asked if she would ever consider unveiling her own beauty range , the starlet said she has thought about it but wants to focus on her current projects at the moment @entity10 is the smile of new @entity202 , @entity203 £ 3.99 available in store now .			1
