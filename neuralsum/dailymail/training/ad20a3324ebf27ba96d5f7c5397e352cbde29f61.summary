scroll down for demo @entity0 has unveiled the @entity0 smartphone , pictured , in a bid to rival @entity5 and @entity6			1
it runs @entity9 and has an enhanced version of the @entity29 camera first added to @entity0 's @entity15 last year - almost five times the megapixels of the @entity19 operating system : windows phone 8 display : 4.5 " @entity34 ( 1280x768 ) , @entity35 + , high brightness mode , sunlight readability battery : 2000 mah battery processor : 1.5 ghz dual - core @entity41 @entity44 camera : @entity15 41 mp with optical image stabilisation resolution : 7712 x 5360 includes @entity48 , @entity50 flash for still images , led flash for video front - facing camera : 1.2 mp wide angle memory : @entity57 , 32 gb internal memory ; cloud storage : 7 gb free @entity61 storage the @entity0 's camera also comes with up to 6x digital zoom that can capture ' more details than other smartphone cameras			1
' this means pictures can be zoomed into and reframed without any of the image quality being lost			0
speaking at the launch event in @entity70 , @entity0 chief executive @entity71 said the handset - which is available in yellow , black and white - can capture pictures and video of ' amazing quality and amazing clarity '			1
' today i 'd like to introduce to you all the next chapter in smartphone photography , ' @entity71 said			0
' the @entity0 will change how you shoot and how you create forever			2
' the @entity0 uses the @entity15 technology previously seen on the @entity82 , 920 and 928			2
it has optical image stabilisation and the company claims the device ' is able to produce some of the sharpest images possible by any digital camera			0
' this technology is combined with the @entity48 application designed to make it easier for anyone to take professional quality images			0
the app 's interface makes changes to photos in real - time as the shot is taken so photographers can see what the final image will look like			0
using a new feature called dual capture , when the @entity0 takes a high - resolution @entity106 image it also takes a smaller @entity108 version to make it easier to share online			1
the @entity0 's @entity29 sensor uses @entity112 optics with six lenses that make it possible to take better photos in low - light conditions			1
the @entity0 's camera also comes with up to 6x digital zoom that can capture more details than other smartphone cameras and some digital cameras			1
this means pictures can be zoomed into and reframed without any of the image quality being lost this also reduces the amount of blur in video and its @entity130 feature ' handles sound pressure levels six times louder than conventional smartphone microphones			0
' @entity0 's latest high - end smartphone was revealed as the @entity13 firm battles to arrest a steady decline in demand for its devices and reclaim ground lost to rivals @entity5 and @entity6			1
a @entity141 release date for the @entity0 was not confirmed but the phone will be available in the @entity143 from july 26 , priced at 299.99 dollars ( £ 198 ) and it is expected in @entity144 ' this quarter '			2
a @entity141 release date for the @entity0 has not been confirmed but the phone will be available in the @entity143 from 26 july at $ 299.99 ( £ 198 ) and is expected in @entity144 ' this quarter ' tech bloggers responded enthusiastically about the camera and handset , but analysts questioned whether it was enough to help @entity0 survive			1
@entity0 is pinning its hopes for a comeback in smartphones on @entity155 's @entity9 - an operating system struggling to compete with @entity159 's popular @entity158 system			1
despite having the high - quality @entity29 camera , the @entity15 failed to live up to expectations and many analysts claimed this was because it was running @entity0 's antiquated @entity165 system			1
while regular mobile phones still account for the bulk of @entity0 's shipments , smartphones are viewed as crucial for its long - term survival because of their higher margins and increasing demand for web access from mobile phones			1
@entity176 , @entity0 's executive vice president in charge of smart devices , said the growing popularity of photo and video sharing meant more consumers will want better cameras			2
' taking pictures is in the top three things people do with a smartphone			0
it 's a relevant feature to be focused on , ' she told @entity190			0
' to stand out you have to differentiate			0
' the new @entity0 's 41 - megapixel count far exceeds those of the @entity19 and @entity193 , at 8 and @entity194 respectively			1
this is also higher than some compact cameras , although higher megapixels do not necessarily mean better photos as factors such as lens quality also affect the end result			0
using a new feature called dual capture , when the @entity0 takes a high - resolution image or video it also makes a smaller copy to make it easier to share online			1
the @entity0 's @entity29 sensor uses @entity112 optics with six lenses that make it possible to take better shots in low - light conditions an example of the high - resolution images taken using the @entity29 camera on the @entity0 1020 ' the imaging capabilities here are extraordinary , ' said @entity220 analyst @entity219			1
but he added : ' it 's still a @entity9			2
if somebody is looking for applications they 're still going to look at @entity19			2
' earlier @entity0 models won positive reviews from critics and technology blogs but have failed to halt a shift to @entity158 phones			2
@entity158 and @entity5 's @entity231 together account for over 90 per cent of smartphone sales , according to research firm @entity233			0
one major handicap has been a lack of apps			0
@entity9 has only 160,000 apps , while rivals offer about five times as many because developers prefer to make them for the higher - volume operating systems			1
@entity243 , telecoms expert at @entity244 said : ' the @entity0 truly takes mobile photography to the next level			2
' whether the mother of all cameras will entice phone fans away from @entity5 and @entity158 devices is questionable , though			0
' the popularity of ‘ kitchen sink ’ devices that deliver a rounded experience in terms of hardware , apps and services , casts doubt on the 1020 ’s wider appeal			0
' there ’s also a bigger issue at hand here			0
looking past the allure of megapixels , @entity0 still seems to lack focus when it comes to an important area – namely the lack of consumer interest in the @entity9 platform			1
' @entity0 is struggling to find its true identity in a challenging market			2
at first glance the @entity0 seems a master - of - one it remains to be seen whether gadget fans will opt for a @entity278 - powered handset over increasingly impressive - and diverse - competition			1
' ' despite the quality of the device , i have some serious doubts about whether it will change @entity0 's fortunes , and it risks becoming a niche product , ' added @entity233 analyst @entity287			2
he and other analysts have also said @entity0 needs to step up advertising and promotion of its phones			2
many have said telecom carrier partners , particularly in the @entity143 , have failed to promote @entity0 to their customers			0
' this is the first real glimmer of hope for @entity0 's resurgence and the viability of the @entity278 ecosystem in smartphones - provided @entity0 , @entity155 , and their operator partners can convince consumers that this experience is indeed a leap forward , ' said @entity306 analyst @entity305			1
' that will be the real hard work			0
' a @entity141 photojournalist recently embarked on a photography project aimed at showing off the quality of cameras across the @entity0 range - especially in low - light conditions			1
@entity315 took photographs of various people at night from across the country ' to shed light on their amazing stories that would otherwise go untold or unseen			0
' all the pictures were taken using @entity0 's @entity323 phone and included pictures of homeless drug addicts @entity337 , pictures taken backstage at @entity328 burlesque club @entity327 showing performers getting ready , images of @entity141 ’s largest skatepark as sports enthusiasts hurl themselves through the air and a young mother training for a kickboxing championship in @entity336			0
