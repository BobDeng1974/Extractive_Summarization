by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:43 pm on 17th july 2011 @entity2 's most long - serving and trusted servant has followed in the footsteps of @entity5 and fallen on his sword			1
@entity7 , 67 , who has worked for the tycoon for 52 years , has resigned from his post as chief executive of @entity11 , which publishes the @entity12			1
his loss will hit @entity2 hard and adds weight to claims from one of president @entity18 's closest allies last night that his @entity20 empire is beginning to ' explode and unravel ' in the wake of the phone hacking scandal			1
@entity7 has worked in @entity23 , the @entity20 and the @entity24 in various positions within @entity2 's organisation since starting out as reporter in @entity28 the claim came as @entity2 's control over @entity31 and other cable channels appeared under increasing threat , with reports he could lose his television licences if found guilty of breaching anti-bribery laws and attorney general @entity37 piled more pressure on the @entity40 chief , as he confirmed the @entity41 is considering opening a formal investigation into whether the company tried to hack into the voicemails of 9/11 victims			1
@entity7 was executive chairman of @entity46 in @entity47 from 1995 to 2007 , periods when the @entity50 was hacking phones			2
growing crisis : @entity2 's @entity20 media empire is beginning to ' explode and unravel ' , according to think tank president @entity53 he said he knew nothing about the scandalous behaviour by journalists which also cost @entity40 chief executive @entity58 her job but added that ‘ the pain caused to innocent people is unimaginable ’ and it was ‘ proper ’ for him to resign from @entity40 @entity7 was born in @entity63 , on @entity64 but moved to @entity23 with his parents as a teenager			1
he joined the @entity67 , which was then run by a young @entity2 in 1960			1
he followed him to @entity68 six years later and then moved on to @entity69 , where he worked as a journalist for a number of the company 's newspapers and magazines			2
he became a @entity20 citizen after landing a senior job at @entity77 in 1986 , but returned to @entity78 in 1995 to become chairman of @entity46			2
after @entity2 bought the @entity12 , mr @entity7 transferred across the @entity80 again in 2007 to become the paper 's chief executive and publisher			1
' that i was ignorant of what apparently happened is irrelevant and in the circumstances i feel it is proper for me to resign			0
' he continued : ' when i left @entity46 in december 2007 , i believed that the rotten element at the @entity50 had been eliminated , that important lessons had been learned and that journalistic integrity was restored			0
' there had never been any evidence delivered to me that suggested the conduct had spread beyond one journalist			0
if others had evidence that wrongdoing went further , i was not told about it			0
' @entity2 said in a statement that he had accepted mr @entity7 's resignation with much sadness at losing his right - hand man after a remarkable journey			2
' that this passage has come to an unexpected end , professionally , not personally , is a matter of much sadness to me , ' he said			0
' i vividly recall an enthusiastic young man in the offices of my first newspaper in @entity28 , where @entity7 joined the company as a 15 - year - old and had the rather unenviable task of buying me sandwiches for lunch			0
' mr @entity2 added that ' @entity40 is not @entity2			1
it is the collective creativity and effort of many thousands of people around the world , and few individuals have given more to this company than @entity7			0
' @entity123 was rubbed into the wound by comments last night from @entity53 , president of the @entity127 , a liberal think tank , and the man who helped @entity18 's transition to the @entity130 in 2008			2
he told the @entity132 : ' this is not one rogue editor			0
this is an empire that was built on a set of journalistic ethics that 's beginning to explode and unravel			1
' they were routinely bribing public officials			0
we 've called attention to the fact that this story is going to go on for a while , this is not a two - week story , i do n't think			0
' probe : attorney general @entity37 is considering launching a formal investigation into claims @entity40 , for which @entity53 , of the @entity127 , predicts a dire future he is one of a number of senior democrats hoping @entity2 's @entity20 empire will fall in the wake of the scandal			1
the @entity130 has long fought with @entity156 , owned by @entity40 , and boycotted the channel for a time			2
now there are increasing signs @entity2 could lose control of all his cable channels in @entity20 , which include @entity162 and @entity163 as well as @entity31			1
under federal law , holders of television and radio stations licences have to undergo character tests to show they are fit and proper to be media owners			0
@entity2 seems unlikely to pass those tests if @entity172 ’s fierce regulator , the @entity171 , seeks to enforce the part of the foreign bribery law that requires companies to keep accurate books , according to the @entity177			2
if it is proven that a company violates this and @entity20 anti-bribery provisions , there is a penalty of up to $ 2m , and if convicted , employees could face up to five years in prison			0
@entity186 , chairman of the @entity187 , reportedly said this week the allegations should be investigated , but did not say whether his organisation would launch such a probe			0
yesterday mr @entity37 confirmed the @entity41 is responding to calls from lawmakers to investigate claims @entity40 hacked into the phones of 9/11 victims			1
at a press conference in @entity197 , he said : ' there have been serious allegations raised in that regard in @entity78 ; there is an ongoing investigation			0
splash : front page of the august 1 , 2007 edition of the @entity12 reporting that @entity2 's @entity40 will purchase @entity11 ' there have been members of @entity208 in the @entity20 who have asked us to investigate those same allegations			1
and we are progressing in the regard using the appropriate federal agencies in the @entity20			0
' he also confirmed reports yesterday that the @entity215 has launched its own informal probe into the allegations			0
it comes as senior @entity219 questioned whether @entity2 's @entity20 papers , such as the @entity221 and the @entity12 , may also have engaged in telephone hacking			1
the @entity219 @entity223 has already launched an online petition to demand the truth from @entity2			1
it reads : ' it 's time for @entity2 to come clean and immediately tell the @entity20 people whether his company targeted any @entity20 's here at home			2
sign our petition to demand the truth			1
' by midday @entity40 shares were down 0.06 per cent as politicians and business experts rounded on @entity2 and the influence he has amassed over the media giant he founded			1
representative @entity241 wrote : ‘ if these allegations are proven true the conduct would merit felony charges for attempting to violate various federal statues related to corruption of public officials and prohibitions against wiretapping			0
‘ any person found guilty of this purported conduct should receive the harshest sanctions available under law			1
’ jeopardised : any convictions against @entity40 could make obtaining television licenses for broadcasting programmes difficult some in the business world think @entity2 ’s days are numbered at the helm of @entity40			1
@entity260 , managing partner at @entity261 , was reported as saying : ‘ it is very likely , there will be at some point ... an entire new management			0
‘ it ’s a fine company , it has great assets and a terrific future but @entity2 ’s influence despite his de facto ownership is going to being diminished			2
’ @entity271 , a director at @entity272 , was reported as saying : ‘ i think investors in @entity20 are needing to know if there is a capable leader , and some question now about whether @entity277 is that capable a leader to run that enterprise			0
‘ the other question is the reassurance that advertisers are n’t going to flee the newspapers titles			0
in the worst case scenario should they flee then they need to kill the brands in the way the @entity50 was anaesthetised or euthanised			0
’ senator @entity288 has criticised the decision for @entity40 to be investigated in the @entity20 , telling @entity290 it 's a ' @entity24 issue that needs to be resolved first '			2
but media consultant @entity292 told @entity31 the scandal is being over-hyped and mr @entity2 has ' done all the right things ' .			1
