' ' we also took the pictures over the course of several months			1
whenever it was time for @entity14 to go outside and play we would dress her up in an outfit and head out			1
i would just follow her around with the camera and take about 30 to 40 pictures per outfit with the hopes of getting two good pics that would work for the blog			2

he said : ' she likes to play dress up so she seemed to like most of them , especially the ones with long coats			0
i think both our favourite may be the sixth doctor 's outfit			2
she liked the colours and i love how the outfit came together			0
it was the most challenging to make			0
my wife is a talented seamstress and she made the coat herself			1
' the show has been a hit with mr @entity60 for a long time			1
he added : ' i 've been watching @entity2 since i was a child			0
shortly after @entity14 's birth we started a complete re-watch of the entire series from the very first @entity12 episode			1

@entity107 's doctor , who hit screens in 1970 , was a little more action - packed than his predecessors and was predisposed towards slightly frilly shirts in 1974 @entity112 arrived as the @entity96 , with his trademark long scarf and trilby			2
he was perhaps one of the most popular doctors @entity117 stepped up to the @entity2 plate in 1981			0
