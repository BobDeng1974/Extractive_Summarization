a mysterious glowing orb has been filmed breaking away from an unidentified meteorite - like object as it streaked across the sky above @entity5			1
the unusual object can be seen moving through the sky leaving a long tail behind that is characteristic of space debris or a meteorite burning up in the atmosphere			1
but after a few seconds a second round object separates from the main fireball and moves off in the opposite direction			1
mystery balls : the orb broke apart and two pieces moved in opposite directions above southern @entity5 @entity20 hunters have claimed the bright orb may have been some sort of escape pod from a crashing ship			1
however , others have said it is more likely to have been a meteorite breaking apart in the atmosphere			1
there have been several sightings of meteorite fireballs in the @entity32 over the past week , with many reports coming from @entity5			1
there have been some suggestions that this may be a meteorite passing through @entity38 's atmosphere - especially considering the @entity40 meteorite shower is currently at its peak			1
however , most experts think it is travelling too slow to be a meteorite - they usually travel much faster			1
it could also be a man - made spacecraft re-entering @entity38 's atmosphere but , as @entity47 of @entity48 points out , if it was a large spacecraft then we 'd probably know about it			2
@entity5 is also near @entity51 , home of the top secret base @entity53 , so it could be some sort of military project			2
the predominant theory at the moment , though , is that it is simply a hoax - all the more likely as there are no other videos of the event			0
if it had been real , it is likely that it would have been seen and captured on video by many people , not just one			0
the past couple of days have also seen astronomers enjoying the peak of the annual @entity40 meteor shower			2
the fireball was spotted by @entity73 while he was driving home from work in southern @entity5			1
he said : ' i was driving home after work when this ufo or whatever you call it caught my eye			2
' i pulled over in front of somebody 's house to film it			0
i would have got a better shot but i did n't want to jump these people 's fence			0
' anyway i do n't know what the hell to make of it			0
could n't have been a plane cause there was no noise			0
and i never heard a crash after either			0
' the @entity97 thing flew straight up into the sky and disappeared			0
' he posted the video on @entity101 on monday evening but did not say when or where the footage had been filmed , other than the general area of @entity5			0
‘ i think it could be something re-entering and bits coming off it , ’ said @entity47 , editor of @entity105			0
‘ however , if it was a big spacecraft then we ’d probably know about it			0
‘ could it be a meteorite ? it ’s a bit slow to be one as they normally travel much faster through the atmosphere , although we are at the peak of the @entity40 meteor shower			1
‘ it could also simply be some clever photoshop , especially considering there do n’t seem to be any other videos of the event which would surely have been seen by many people			0
' also , @entity5 is right next to @entity51 , home of the top secret base inside @entity53			2
there 's always a chance that this is some military project gone awry			0
' reports of a fireball above @entity5 were received by the @entity128 on 3 january 2015 the video shows around 30 seconds of footage of the @entity20 before cutting off abruptly and showing a black screen for the final two minutes			1
according to the @entity20 news site @entity134 , the smaller orb breaking away from the main fireball is ' peculiar '			1
it said : ' the smaller orb @entity20 in this video behaves differently than typical meteorite debris			1
' according to the @entity128 , there have been several reports of meteorites across the @entity32 over the past week			1
it received more than 1,500 eyewitness accounts - mainly in @entity144 but some as far away as @entity145 and @entity5 - of a bright fireball passing through the sky on 29 december			1
the society also said it has also received 17 reports from eyewitnesses in northern @entity5 of a fireball in the sky on 3 january			1
the @entity153 has said that they are responsible for at least half of the @entity20 sightings reported in the 1950s and 60s			1
the @entity32 agency explained that many @entity20 sightings over that period were directly correlated to tests on the @entity160 spy plane			1
the plane was being flown at altitudes of more than 60,000 feet , once thought an impossible height to fly at			0
analysts at the @entity153 soon realized that @entity20 sightings lined up with the place and time the u- 2 planes were flying			1
the @entity153 admitted that many @entity20 sightings in the 1950s and 60s were tests on its u- 2 spy plane ( shown ) however , they purposefully chose not to let people know that what they were seeing were not aliens but spies			1
now u- 2 planes are flown by the @entity178 and 104 have been built in total			0
in 2013 the @entity153 officially acknowledged the existence of @entity53			0
the site , a badly kept secret for decades , has fueled the imaginations of conspiracy theorists and ufo hunters around the world			0
documents released by the @entity153 confirmed the mysterious airbase existed and revealed its exact location in @entity51			0
official maps usually only show a disused mine at the site or a large area of restricted airspace , however it does feature on @entity195 and in satellite images			0
the documents also revealed some strange goings on at the secret base - but not the kind that @entity20 hunters have believed			1
they revealed that among the jobs staff at the site had to perform during the 1960s was a routine of vacuuming the runway to allow the experimental u- 2 aircraft to take off without damaging their engines			2
eyewitnesses reported briefly seeing a fireball ( top right ) in the skies above @entity144 on 29 december 2014 @entity213 , from the @entity128 , said : ' this video looks fake			1
it was published on jan 5th and we had no reports of fireballs in southern california on jan 5th or @entity220 4th			0
' one eyewitness calling themselves @entity223 described the fireball as having a green colour			2
they said : ' i saw a secondary little fireball ( very light ) at the time of maximum brightness of the first fireball			2
' others reported seeing a small flash as the fireball faded from view			2
one said : ' some fragments seemed to emanate from the tail as it fell			0
' one man from @entity240 , @entity241 , reported seeing what he thought was a satellite in the sky that appeared to break into two objects			0
writing on @entity20 website @entity246 ( @entity246 ) , he said : ' as the object came next to the moon there was an extremely brief flash from its right side and a momentary trail and secondary object , that looked like a yellow / green fireball slightly larger than the first object , as if shot out or ejected , was observed for less than a second			1
' the primary light continued on its straight path for another second or two and then disappeared			0
' i am unsure if what i observed and laid out in my narrative is what happened or if some light phenomenon caused by the satellite passing by the brilliantly lit half moon created an effect that i saw			0
' however , some commentators have have questioned whether the latest video is genuine and may have been digitally edited after filming			0
the annual @entity271 ( seen here above @entity272 , @entity273 ) reached its peak on monday and may be responsible for the increase in sightings of fireballs and meteorites in recent days mr @entity73 did not respond to questions put to him by the @entity280			1
his @entity101 account contains only one other video that was uploaded on the same day as the @entity20 video and claims to be a film of seagulls in @entity144			1
@entity287 , author of the @entity288 , said regardless of what it was , the video has got @entity20 believers excited			2
he said : ' this could be a meteor or space junk crashing back to @entity38 , but what the so - called ' white orb ' leaving it has certainly got @entity20 believers excited			1
' they wonder if it is an escape pod being ejected from a crashing @entity20			1
' at first it just looks like something falling out of the trail of the object , but it carries on under its own power rather than falling away as you might expect			0
' it makes me wonder if it is a completely different object that just looks as if it is coming out of this fireball trail			2
' whatever these events are , they are very unusual even if they are not flying saucers occupied by little green men plunging to @entity38 in a spectacular fashion			2
' @entity312 , a space and astronomy journalist , said that while unusual , the orb was probably part of a meteorite fireball breaking apart as it entered the atmosphere			1
he said : ' it 's almost certainly a fireball breaking apart in the upper atmosphere			1
' these things have been floating about in space for billion of years , and their interiors are very , very cold			0
' they formed from dust grains clumping together in the solar system , and often have cracks and weak spots that can break them apart when their surfaces suddenly heat up - it just so happens that in this case , the crack was in the right place enough to send a large fragment flying off in the other direction			2
' he added that the fireball appears to be moving slowly across the sky due to perspective it is filmed from and because of the time of day it was filmed			2
he said : ' @entity343 approaching @entity38 's ' trailing ' hemisphere as it moves through space have to ' catch up ' with our planet before they enter the atmosphere			0
' @entity349 , pro-am coordinator at the @entity351 , added : ' i 'd guess a re-entry of some space junk if i were a betting man			0
' it 's burning up in the upper atmosphere , indicating a high velocity , it does appear to be moving " slowly " which may be due to the angle from which footage was taken			0

strange fireball was spotted by *commuter* @entity73 as he drove home
@entity128 received 1,500 fireball sightings in the past week
@entity20 experts say the bright orb flying in the opposite direction is ' peculiar '
sighting has *sparked* speculation that it may be a @entity20 or aircraft crashing
fireball may have also been a meteorite breaking apart in the atmosphere
