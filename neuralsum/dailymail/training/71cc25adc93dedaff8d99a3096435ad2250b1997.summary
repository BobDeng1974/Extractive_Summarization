scientists may have found the oldest known remains of a ‘ northerner ’			1
analysis of a leg bone fragment unearthed from a cave in @entity6 suggests it is more than 10,000 years old , making it the earliest human bone from northern @entity9 on @entity10 from @entity12 @entity11 and the @entity13 have published the radiocarbon analysis results in the @entity15			1
analysis of a leg bone fragment unearthed from a cave in @entity6 suggests it is more than 10,000 years old , making it the earliest human bone from northern @entity9 on record ‘ the earliest evidence for humans [ in the north of @entity9 ] after the end of the last @entity31 is stone tools , ’ said dr @entity23 , an ecologist at @entity11 and one of the authors of the study			1
‘ now we actually have one of the people as well			0
’ dr @entity23 said the scientists are 100 per cent sure the bone is human and believe it is very likely to have belonged to an adult			1
additional analysis , including testing for dna and assessing the make - up of the bone chemistry , could possibly help determine the gender and localise the fragment further			2

dr @entity23 is pictured with a femur to show the type of bone he used for the research dr @entity23 said : ‘ we are a regional university and we have an awful lot of our students from north west @entity59			2
it ’s nice to add to the history of the area			0
’ @entity46 , an archaeologist and phd student at @entity11 , said : ‘ previous cave burials of humans from around this date have been in southern @entity59 , with later dates further north			2
‘ however , the date of this human femur is contemporary with the earliest post-glacial human bones from caves in the south suggesting similar ritual behaviour in both @entity73 and @entity75 caves at the same time			0
’ the bone was discovered along with horse and elk remains , which are believed to date from a ' warm snap ' at the end of the last @entity31 around 12,000 years ago			1
all the bones , now housed at @entity82 in @entity83 , were excavated from @entity84 on the north side of @entity86 in the early 1990s .			0

the adult bone dates from a ' warm snap ' at the end of the last @entity31
up until now , the earliest evidence of humans in the region was stone tools
scientists discovered the bone *alongside* horse and elk remains
