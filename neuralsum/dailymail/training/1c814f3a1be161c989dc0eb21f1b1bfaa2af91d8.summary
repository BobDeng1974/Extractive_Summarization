by @entity0 published : 18:55 est , 16 june 2013 updated : 19:44 est , 16 june 2013 @entity1 warned last night that the @entity2 should remain on its guard against @entity4 despite the surprise election of reformist - backed @entity6 as the country ’s new president			1
tens of thousands of chanting supporters filled the streets of @entity12 following the landslide victory in joyous scenes a world apart from the violent crackdown on a thwarted people ’s uprising four years ago			1
cars honked and blared music ranging from patriotic songs to the @entity22 after the triumphant cleric - who studied in @entity24 in the 1970s and has a law doctorate from @entity26 - romped home with more than three times the votes of his nearest rival			1
leaders : @entity1 prime minister @entity31 ( left ) insisted there should be no ' wishful thinking ' about reformist - backed @entity6 's ( right ) election as @entity4 's new president but while @entity36 and the @entity37 were cautiously urging @entity4 to follow through with a more moderate agenda , @entity1 prime minister @entity31 insisted there should be no ‘ wishful thinking ’ about mr @entity6 ’s election			1
‘ @entity4 will be judged on its actions			0
if it insists on continuing to develop its nuclear programme the answer needs to be clear - stopping its nuclear programme by any means , ’ he added			2
the newly - elected leader said yesterday that @entity4 ’s dire economic problems ca n’t be solved ‘ overnight			0
’ after winning over 50 per cent of the vote in friday ’s poll , he said his election was a ‘ victory of moderation over extremism			1
’ one of his key election pledges was to restore relations with @entity58 powers and seek to ease the crippling international sanctions imposed over its nuclear ambitions that have led to ballooning inflation at more than 30 per cent and 14 per cent unemployment			2
but in @entity4 , even landslides at the ballot box do not equate to policymaking influence			0
all key decisions - including nuclear efforts , defence and foreign affairs - remain solidly in the hands of @entity73 ayatollah @entity72 , his ruling clerics and their powerful protectors , the @entity76			0
happy : supporters of the @entity4 president elect @entity6 celebrate as he visits the shrine of the late revolutionary founder @entity79 , just outside @entity12 , @entity4 , yesterday young fan : an @entity4 girl flashes a victory sign , as she holds up a poster of @entity6 in @entity12 although he wo n’t take power until august , mr @entity6 took his first steps yesterday in consulting @entity4 ’s clerically dominated establishment on his plans for the future			1
what mr @entity6 ’s victory does is reopen space for moderate and liberal voices that have been largely muzzled in reprisal for the massive protests and clashes in 2009 over claims the vote was rigged to deny reformists the presidency			1
' @entity4 will be judged on its actions			0
if it insists on continuing to develop its nuclear programme the answer needs to be clear - stopping its nuclear programme by any means ' @entity31 , @entity1 pm the 64 year old is hardly a radical - having served in governments and in the highly sensitive role of nuclear negotiator - but he has taken a strong stance against the combative isolationist international policies of outgoing president @entity110			2
‘ i thank @entity112 that once again rationality and moderation has shined on @entity4 , ’ he said on state tv at the weekend			0
‘ this is the victory of wisdom , a victory of moderation and a victory of commitment over extremism			0
’ his emphasis on outreach could sharply lower the political temperature between @entity4 and the @entity2 - including @entity1 - and perhaps nudge the ruling establishment toward more flexible approaches in possible renewed nuclear talks with the @entity37 and world powers			0
mr @entity6 also has added leverage with his political godfather and ally , former president @entity132 , who was blocked from the ballot but now can exert significant influence from the wings			1
the @entity136 congratulated @entity4 voters for ‘ their courage in making their voices heard ’ despite clampdowns that included severe restrictions on the @entity144 , a key tool of @entity4 ’s opposition			0
big victory : supporters of @entity6 , shown in the poster , attend a celebration gathering in @entity12 all smiles : @entity6 waves to his supporters at the shrine of @entity4 late supreme leader @entity79 @entity154 urged @entity12 ’s leadership to ‘ heed the will of the @entity4 people and make responsible choices , ’ while noting the @entity37 remained open for direct dialogue with @entity4			1
just a week ago , mr @entity6 - the only cleric in the race - seemed greatly overshadowed by candidates with much deeper ties to the ruling theocracy and @entity76			1
but he gained momentum : first with endorsements from mr @entity132 and another moderate - minded former president @entity166			0
' i thank @entity112 that once again rationality and moderation has shined on @entity4			0
this is the victory of wisdom , a victory of moderation and a victory of commitment over extremism ' @entity6 then artists , activist and opposition leaders joined			1
in the span of a few days , mr @entity6 was drawing huge crowds and the race - once seen as firmly in the control of the ruling system - was suddenly transformed			1
@entity185 , a senior policy analyst at the @entity186 who follows @entity4 affairs , described mr @entity6 as a de facto hero for reformists who could n’t support any of the other five candidates on the ballot			2
‘ it remains to be seen how much room will be given to @entity6 by @entity73 ayatollah @entity72 and the @entity76 , ’ he cautioned			2
@entity4 ’s new leader is said to be fluent in @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199			0
he appears to be proud of his @entity24 education , even mentioning it in a campaign video			0
he studied at the old @entity26 - now @entity26 - in the 1970s under his family name , @entity6 , and returned in the 1990s to get his law doctorate .			2
