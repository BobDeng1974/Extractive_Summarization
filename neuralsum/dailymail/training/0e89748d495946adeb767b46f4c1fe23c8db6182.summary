when he rules this country , perhaps not for half a century or more , he will be @entity5 vii. until then , he will be known formally as his royal highness @entity6 of @entity8			1
@entity9 and @entity1 came to a relatively quick decision yesterday about the hugely anticipated name			1
@entity5 had long been the favourite , with bookmakers shortening the odds in recent days			1
the @entity33 understands that @entity9 and @entity1 had already decided by the time they introduced the @entity36 to her heir – and third great - grandchild – at @entity17 yesterday morning			1
there is no royal protocol which dictates the sovereign must be given approval , but it is believed the couple discussed their choice with her during their 30 - minute meeting			1
they then told other members of their immediate family before making the news public at 6.15pm			0
a statement issued by their office at @entity17 said : ‘ the @entity0 and @entity1 are delighted to announce that they have named their son @entity2			1
‘ the baby will be known as @entity60 prince george of cambridge			0
’ it took only two days for the name to be released , compared with seven when @entity9 was born in 1982			0

first day at home : @entity1 , @entity9 and their baby left @entity17 today as they were seen for the first time since leaving hospital last night very happy : @entity1 and @entity9 both smiled and waved to crowds outside the gates , but @entity17 would not reveal where they were heading relaxed : @entity9 looked fresh and was wearing glasses while @entity1 chatted to their newborn and grinned to people watching as she sat next to their prince 's baby seat new mother : @entity1 waved with her left hand and appeared to have her right hand resting next to her baby it is likely the @entity36 will have been thrilled by the choice of name , given that her father was @entity95			1
he was christened @entity97 and was known to his family as @entity95 , but monarchs are allowed to pick a name under which to rule			0
he chose @entity5 in honour of his father , @entity102 , and to create the impression of stability after the scandal caused by the abdication of his brother , @entity107 @entity5 is also the fourth name of the @entity110			2
historian and biographer @entity111 said : ‘ @entity5 is obviously a tribute to the @entity36 ’s father and will , i imagine , give @entity116 great pleasure			1
’ on tuesday , the @entity118 ’s royal correspondent , @entity117 , asked @entity9 whether he would name his son @entity5 in line with the bookmakers ’ predictions			1
the duke laughed and said : ‘ wait and see			0
’ @entity124 , the baby ’s third name , is @entity9 ’s fourth name – he is @entity9			0
it was chosen by @entity129 as a tribute to his close friend and mentor , lord @entity133 , the @entity0 ’s uncle			2
he was assassinated by the @entity135 in august 1979 when his boat was blown up on a fishing trip off the coast of @entity139			0
the less obvious choice is @entity141 , although there are also some royal relatives : prince @entity0 ’s grandfather was @entity141 , for example			1
the first @entity6 of @entity8 , born in 1819 , led something of a scandalous life after refusing to have an arranged marriage because he fell in love with a commoner			2
when he wed actress @entity156 , without the sovereign ’s approval , she was already the mother of two of his children and pregnant with his third			0
