by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:00 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 09:53 est , 4 january 2013 @entity2 today rejected the idea of @entity4 becoming a second class member of the @entity6 , insisting he would not give up his place at the @entity9 ‘ table ’			1
the prime minister gave his biggest hint yet that he will use his imminent speech on @entity13 to rebuff calls from many in the @entity17 party for a radical change in the @entity4 ’s membership of the @entity6			1
it comes as @entity22 boss sir @entity21 warned an exit from the @entity6 ' would be very bad for @entity4 business and the economy as a whole ' and risked putting up ' the barriers of isolation and protectionism '			1
@entity2 , who is due to give a major speech setting out his @entity13 policy this month , vowed not to give up @entity4 's place in setting @entity6 rules mr @entity2 explicitly rejected the idea of replicating the status of countries like @entity37 and @entity38 which have refused to join the @entity6 , but are forced to sign up to many of its rules in order to access the single market			1
but he pledged voters would get a ' real choice ' on @entity4 's relationship with the @entity6 , including attempting to claw back powers			1
however , @entity49 leader @entity48 said the @entity4 people could not believe what mr @entity2 says			2
mr @entity48 said : ' he sits there and thinks his great extended tease about this forthcoming @entity13 speech is entertaining , it is not			0
[ no matter what he says now , after so many broken promises , so many " cast - iron guarantees " , can anybody honestly believe that he will be telling the truth this time ? the simple fact is that he wants us to stay in the @entity6 no matter how it is configured			2
' an influential group of @entity13 federalists , who want to see @entity9 given even greater powers , is suggesting the @entity4 be relegated to ‘ associate member ’ status			1
the move would see @entity4 remain part of the single market but freed from much of the social legislation and bureaucracy associated with full @entity6 membership			1
under the plan the @entity4 's 73 meps in the @entity74 would be scrapped , along with its commissioner and power to veto new rules			0
instead @entity4 would remain attached to the @entity6 ’s single market , but not have influence on how the @entity13 bloc develops			2
the idea has been hailed as ‘ great news ’ but senior @entity84 , who have urged mr @entity2 to set out a radical new @entity13 policy in his long - awaited speech this month			1
but critics warn it would see @entity91 ‘ ruled by fax ’ from @entity9			0
@entity49 leader @entity48 said the @entity4 people could not believe what mr @entity2 says mr @entity2 today again rejected the idea of leaving the @entity6 altogether			1
‘ i think we are better in			0
you have to think of our national interest			0
@entity4 is a trading nation , we are one of the world 's great trading nations , one of the world 's great manufacturers , on our doorstep is this enormous single market , the biggest market in the world			0
‘ it matters to us not just that our goods and services have access to these markets , ' he told @entity111			0
‘ we want to be round the table writing the rules of that market , which is why i do n't think it ’s right to aim for a status like @entity37 or @entity38 where basically you have to obey all the rules of the single market but you do n't get to say what they are			0
’ @entity22 boss sir @entity21 warned @entity4 had to play an active role in @entity13 or become ' an island completely adrift in 20 years ' the idea of ' associate membership ' is being pushed by the @entity125 which views @entity4 as a ‘ continual impediment ’ to the dream of creating a united federal @entity13			1
@entity129 mep @entity128 , who heads the @entity125 , said the proposal would create a new category of @entity6 membership to stop @entity4 leaving altogether			2
‘ if @entity2 proposes a catalogue of opt - outs , derogations , red lines and rebates for @entity4 to pick and choose , then he will strengthen the argument for the creation of a formal association for the @entity4 , ’ he said			2
. ‘ the priority on the @entity143 is to create a federal system which works and @entity4 is seen at present as a continual impediment			0
‘ the federal movement in the spring is to draft a new treaty that will , i have no doubt , include associate membership			0
’ the @entity125 is expected to set out the plan in a draft @entity6 treaty in the spring			0
last week @entity154 , the former @entity155 president , suggested @entity4 could leave the @entity6 but remain as a ‘ partner ’			1
' if the @entity4 do not follow the tendency towards more integration in the @entity6 , we can anyway stay friends , but in another way , ’ he said			2
however , business leaders have warned against leaving the @entity6			0
writing on his blog , @entity164 boss sir @entity21 said : ' an exit would be very bad for @entity4 business and the economy as a whole			1
' the @entity4 has always been a successful trading nation and has built relationships around the world to help its companies prosper			0
however , today global business relies on large trading agreements created by regions and not by countries			0
' the @entity6 is the @entity4 's biggest trading partner			2
the @entity4 must not become a peripheral country on the edge of @entity13			0
this will be damaging to long - term prospects of @entity4 business and also in the country 's ability to attract new international companies to set up and employ people in the country			1
' without taking a postieve , constructive approach ' @entity4 could be an island completely adrift in 20 years , ' he warned .			1
