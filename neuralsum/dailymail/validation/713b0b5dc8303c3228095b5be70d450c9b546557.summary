the insignia on @entity3 's baseball cap reads @entity4 but whether or not he can enhance his claim to be @entity7 boxer by beating @entity8 , he already holds the title of world 's greatest self - promoting athlete			1
not only will may 2 in @entity12 be the most gigantic happening in the annals of human kind – or something like that – but even admission tickets for the official announcement which is about to take place are like gold - dust			1
floyd the @entity22 versus @entity8 the @entity8 will be formally launched with more fireworks than a @entity25 moon rocket this wednesday			1
@entity3 had the @entity4 cap on after beating @entity27 in @entity12 last september @entity3 has also been sporting a @entity4 t - shirt during his training camp in @entity12 invitations to these media events are usually pressed on we hacks by @entity35 men pleading with us to attend and fans are often allowed in to help fill the room			1
this one is making a little history all its own by requiring that we apply for accreditation and such is the frenzy that we are warned ' space is limited			0
' never mind the richest fight of all time , which was a sellout while still only a gleam in the eye of the promoters , but they could have sold tickets for this head - to - head sabre - rattling by the gladiators in @entity52			1
given the cost of flights from @entity55 , we thank them for not doing so			0
not so much as a twitch of a muscle or the flicker of a nerve is to be missed in these weeks in which all roads lead to the @entity63 on that neon @entity12 in the desert			2
for this , @entity3 can take most of the credit			1
the five years in which he held to ransom the hundreds of millions around the world who have been begging him to face @entity8 in the ring have generated a commercial monster of unprecedented enormity			2
@entity3 was on the famous @entity12 as he took a break from training for his fight with @entity8 @entity8 shadow boxes in the ring as he prepares for the richest fight in history of boxing even before these reluctant grooms affirm their vows to each other in public for the first time , estimates as to the potential worth of this fight have soared from a lip - licking $ 200million to at least an eye - watering $ 350m and maybe a gob - smacking half a billion			1
whatever @entity3 's reasons for stalling – and he has been accused of everything from cowardice ( outrageously ) to an excessive obsession with his undefeated record ( possibly ) – he has proved himself to be an economic genius			1
had he agreed to this shotgun wedding back in the year 2000 he and @entity8 would have received half each of a total purse estimated at around $ 60m			1
now he is getting the 60 per cent upside of a deal which is expected to deliver $ 210m to him and $ 140m to his arch - rival			1
the bulk of that money will come from pay - per - view television but claims that @entity106 and @entity107 in @entity108 – and either @entity109 or @entity110 here – will be short - changed by fighters past their prime are being rebuffed by boxing men in the know			0
@entity8 's seven - time @entity116 in the @entity108 – @entity117 – tells us : ' this will be a much better fight for tv and the fans than if it had happened when it was first discussed			1
the @entity125 legend had complained about ' feeling slow ' but looked up to speed during his fifth day of training the 36 - year - old is completing his training regime at @entity117 's @entity130 in @entity52 ' @entity3 could well have won back then by running and dodging behind that highly technical defence of his			1
but now that his legs have slowed a little @entity8 will have more chances of getting to him , making a real fight of it and beating him			2
' for me and @entity8 this will still be the biggest challenge of our careers			2
it will still be our most difficult fight			0
but it is one we can win			0
' that opinion will gain legs of it own in @entity52 this week , all the time continue to build an already massive market around the world			2
@entity3 's business acumen has already made him the wealthiest sportsman on the planet			2
after this there will be no catching him in the foreseeable future			0
even as he waits for the biggest pay cheque of all , he continues to enjoy the fruits of his punishing fistic labours			0
mr @entity22 's idea of a break from hard training in his hometown vegas this weekend was a trip along the @entity12 for a little high - rolling in a casino			1
who can deny that 's he 's earned it ? and whatever anyone may think of him , there is no smarter operator in the whole wide world of sport			0
the first leg of what @entity174 boxing hoped would be a world - title double in @entity177 came nastily unstuck at the weekend			0
@entity179 's @entity178 went in to his bid to become a two - division world champion full of promise but ended up flat on his back			2
after stepping up to bantamweight to defeat @entity185 , our somewhat vulnerable @entity187 belt - holder , @entity178 took the unusual step of training back down in poundage to challenge super-flyweight champion @entity192			0
@entity178 was knocked out by a brutal uppercut from @entity192 in the eighth round @entity178 was bidding to become a two - division world champion but was beaten by @entity196 alarmingly , the rangy @entity196 comprehensively outclassed him before landing a knockout uppercut in the eighth			0
@entity174 boxing is on the rise but this came as a sharp reminder that at its best the hardest game is never easy			0
next up at the @entity203 , on april 19 , is @entity177 's own @entity204			0
the veteran lightweight faces what appears to be an even tougher assignment against @entity209 champion @entity208 and will need to box at the highest level of his career if he is to assuage the @entity214 disappointment .			0

@entity3 and @entity8 battle it out in @entity12 on may 2
the only press *conference* before fight week takes place this wednesday
promoters could have raked it in selling tickets for the event in @entity52
@entity3 deserves the credit for creating such a frenzy around the fight
by may , the fight could be worth an estimated half a billion *dollars*
the *current* estimate is $ 350m with @entity3 taking 60 per cent - $ 240m
that means @entity8 's share would be a *minimum* $ 140m
