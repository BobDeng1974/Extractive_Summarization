figures in the report suggested almost 650 children reported missing in towns across @entity17 in 2014 were at risk of child sexual exploitation or serious harm			1
schoolgirls are routinely being approached by much older men who ply them with alcohol , drugs and gifts as a way of grooming them for sex , according to a study commissioned by police ( file picture ) but despite almost 13,000 reports of child sex abuse in the past six years , only 1,078 people were convicted , figures from @entity32 revealed			1
the report ’s author – @entity39 mp @entity38 – insisted police were making progress on the issue , but this prompted furious claims last night that the study ‘ whitewashed ’ the extent of police failings to deal with on - street grooming			1
the study was also criticised for failing to address the fact that many street grooming gangs are made up by men of @entity54 origin			1
the inquiry was commissioned following the 2012 @entity57 grooming scandal when a gang of @entity54 men , including the eight pictured , preyed on vulnerable young girls the inquiry was commissioned following the @entity57 grooming scandal in 2012 when a gang of nine @entity54 men preyed on vulnerable young girls			1
today ’s 148 - page report – real voices , @entity68 – was commissioned by the local police and crime commissioner @entity69			1
it said that in some districts young girls are regularly approached by men at the school gates or urged to get into cars while walking home from school			1
victims were sometimes blamed for the abuse , with descriptions of child prostitutes or ‘ slags ’ recorded by officers – even about children as young as 13			2
in one case , officers did not consider a girl of 13 to be a victim as she was wearing ‘ sexualised ’ clothes , including a crop top			0
the report ’s author - @entity39 mp @entity38 ( left ) - insisted police were making progress on tackling grooming , but @entity57 mp @entity95 ( left ) said the study ' lacks the independence needed to confront the deep problems in @entity32 that have allowed far too many paedophiles to get away with terrible crimes ' miss @entity38 , chairman of the @entity102 ’ all - party group for runaway and missing children and adults , said the child sex abuse cases in @entity57 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 were a ‘ deafening wake - up call ’			1
the @entity110 mp added : ‘ i have been concerned about the number of people who have told me that in some neighbourhoods child sexual exploitation had become the new social norm			0
’ the former social worker recommends a radical new approach to tackle the problem to be led by young people , which recognises that the police , justice system and children ’ s services alone can not succeed in protecting children , especially at a time of deep spending cuts			2
she called for more thorough child sexual exploitation training of police officers and for the issue to be declared a public health priority just like drugs and obesity			2
but her report ran into criticism last night			0
@entity95 , @entity57 mp , said : ‘ this was a report commissioned by @entity32 and it lacks the independence needed to confront the deep problems in @entity32 that have allowed far too many paedophiles to get away with terrible crimes			1

’ home secretary @entity149 ( left ) said the report showed the way police were dealing with the problem was ' not good enough ' and sir @entity154 , chief constable of @entity17 , said there was always more that can be done ' to safeguard and support young people ' @entity158 , who was raped by an @entity54 gang in @entity108 when she was 12 , said : ‘ this report makes very depressing reading when i ’ve done so much work campaigning against child sexual exploitation – i hoped we would have seen some improvements by now , but that just has n’t been the case			1
‘ the report makes a valid point that not all grooming gangs across the country are @entity54 but it ’s very clear that in @entity17 there ’s an issue of girls being targeted by men from @entity175 and @entity176 in particular			1

’ troubled girls who were ignored here are some of the victims ’ harrowing experiences revealed in @entity38 ’s report into child exploitation in @entity17 : crop - top girl in a normally confidential file , prosecutors spell out how a young abuse victim dressing in provocative clothes was enough for them not to take the case to court			1
it states : ‘ the victim is known ( as highlighted by social workers ) to tend to wear sexualised clothes when she is out of school , such as cropped tops			0
’ ‘ while her age at the time and the date of the decision are not given , it gives two similarly disturbing examples for prosecutors not proceeding with abuse allegations			0
one said how a girl ’s “ unsettled background ” made her “ far from an ideal victim ” ’ , while another pointed out , “ i note her father has referred to her to a social worker as being a slag , saying she is responsible for what has happened ”			0
’ @entity227 told to move house another troubled young girl who was groomed by a 44 - year - old man said her family was told by social workers to ‘ move house ’ when they tried to report him			2
she told the authors : ‘ one social worker was very snobby ... one looked down their nose at me [ and ] another said : “ why do n’t you move ? ” ’ her abuser eventually pleaded guilty in court , but she was failed again by the authorities as the family were not notified			0
