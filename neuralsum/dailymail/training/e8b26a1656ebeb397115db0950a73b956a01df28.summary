by @entity0 published : 09:42 est , 13 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:45 est , 13 february 2014 an @entity4 employee who gave @entity5 his passwords in order to access classified information has resigned after the agency stripped him of his security clearance			1
two others - one member of the military and one contractor - have both been banned from @entity4 facilities after being ' implicated ' for helping @entity5			1
@entity16 reports that the @entity4 has launched an internal inquiry into @entity5 and the way in which he was able to collect classified information while working as a consultant before releasing it publicly and causing an international debate over surveillance procedures			2
none of the individuals have been named , but the civilian employee who has been fired was apparently used as a way for @entity5 to gain greater access to agency information			2
trickery : a new memo finds that a civilian @entity4 employee logged into @entity5 's computer at the hacker 's request but did n't realize he was able to record his keystrokes and used the password at a later date the unclassified memo , which was sent to both the congressional intelligence and judiciary committees on february 10 , states that @entity5 once asked the person to log into their account on @entity5 's computer			1
' unbeknownst to the civilian , mr @entity5 was able to capture the password , allowing him even greater access to classified information , ' the memo states according to @entity16			1
this new report comes in contrast to what @entity5 and some of his other former colleagues have described			0
@entity5 , whose days are numbered under his temporary asylum status in @entity52 , previously claimed that he never deceived colleagues or used their passwords without them knowing			0
defending their tactics : general @entity56 testified in front of the @entity58 on december 11 saying that at the time they had three cases they were reviewing he also said that in the rare instances where colleagues asked him to log in for them for whatever reason - for instance , if they were on holiday - he said he never used those opportunities to dig deeper into classified @entity4 data			0
the civilian employee may have been duped into giving his password to @entity5 , the memo says that it still shows that they ' failed to comply with security obligations '			1
the civilian is the only one of the three to resign at this point , while the other two are having their cases reviewed by their superiors			0
no further details about the contractor and military member 's involvement , or what prompted their credentials to be revoked			0
ironic fashion statement : @entity5 apparently wore a sweatshirt just like this one to work at the @entity4 and his colleagues thought it was just a funny fashion choice rather than a warning sign the memo comes almost two months to the day since the @entity58 held hearings with @entity4 director general @entity56			2
at the time , he said that they were ' currently reviewing ' three cases			0
there has been no official confirmation that the three cases mentioned in this week 's memo were the three that @entity56 was referring to			0
if they are , however , it also does not make the timeline clear as to when the civilian resigned and when the other two were barred from @entity4 facilities in relation to both the december 11 hearing and the february 10 memo release .			1

new memo reveals that a civilian @entity4 employee logged into @entity5 's computer but he captured the password and was able to use it later
report reveals that the employee did not know that @entity5 *intended* to *distribute* the information but log in was a *breach* of *protocols*
two others - one member of the military and one contractor - have been banned from @entity4 facilities but their involvement *remains* a *mystery*
comes in contrast to @entity5 's earlier declarations that he did not steal passwords from his former colleagues
