@entity0 will give @entity1 a matter of days , rather than a year , to decide whether his next fight will be against the rejuvenated star of @entity6 boxing			1
@entity0 is not holding his breath			2
nor does he expect @entity9 ’s @entity8 to go through with the world title fight which could lead to one of those battles of @entity6 the home fans love			1
landing : @entity0 was back to his best in defeating @entity15 in @entity16 on saturday night no go : @entity0 is not confident of facing @entity1 ( left ) or @entity8 ( right ) before the end of the year all of which complicates @entity0 ’s future planning following his brilliant victory over the experienced @entity15 in @entity16 on saturday night			1
@entity1 , who dug deep to protect his unbeaten record against @entity23 in a thriller atop the same bill in the @entity26 , is being asked if he will reschedule his next fight from september to november to give @entity0 adequate training time after he fasts during @entity29			1
the reluctance of @entity1 to answer that question makes @entity0 suspect that the world ’s no 1 fighter is wary of the speed which bedazzled @entity35			1
@entity1 is much happier discussing a re-match with @entity23 , even though talks with team @entity0 began in @entity16			1
but @entity0 , having wasted a year in in the dashed expectation of fighting @entity1 this weekend , is not prepared to wait again			1
he says : ‘ now i ’m back in business i need another meaningful fight in the autumn			0
i want to get it sorted in principle in the next couple of weeks			0
‘ i think people have been warning @entity1 about my speed			2
he is a great boxer but as he gets older and slows down a little i think he knows i can give him problems , being as quick as i am			0
’ as for @entity8 , who has been calling him out , @entity0 has always said that the man from @entity9 needs to prove himself at elite level , preferably by winning a world title			1
@entity8 has been nominated by the @entity52 as the mandatory challenger to their welterweight champion @entity54 but @entity0 says : ‘ i do n’t believe @entity8 will take that fight			1
not only is @entity54 tough and dangerous but @entity8 has a lot of confidence issues			1
‘ a source close to his camp tells me that @entity8 keeps asking if this is the right time for him , if he ’s ready for such a difficult fight			1
it ’s like he ’s already lost that fight in his head			0
’ other november alternatives for @entity0 would be a re-match of his own against one of the two rivals who knocked his career off track for a while , @entity75 or @entity76			1
he says : ‘ i would love the chance to put the record straight with both of them			0
’ but his preoccupation is with @entity1 , even if they both have to come through additional fights later this year before meeting next may : ‘ i will feel unfulfilled if the fight does n’t happen			1
you always want to take on the best			0
gather round : @entity0 speaks to the @entity6 press the day after his victory over @entity35 in @entity16 @entity87 , bash , bosh : @entity0 was dominant as he made a claim to be @entity1 's next opponent party time : @entity0 celebrates his victory over @entity35 in what was his first fight in more than a year @entity0 is 13/2 to beat @entity1 if the two meet in the ring			1
@entity1 is 1/12 with the draw priced at 33/1			2

‘ not only that but i think they can give the people what they want , namely @entity1 ’s first defeat			2
it feels that the public have grown tired of him , even the @entity106			0
when i talk to taxi drivers here or people come up to me at dinner , it seems they hate him now			0
’ @entity1 who is planning a trip to @entity113 next month - apparently part business , part pleasure – and has told @entity0 he would like to meet up with him			1
but @entity0 says : ‘ i do n’t think he ’ll be coming to @entity116			2
i guess i would have to go down to @entity117			0
’ the improvements @entity0 has made during eight months working with new trainer @entity119 may not be helping his pursuit of @entity1			1
not only has he tightened the defence of his chin but he has learned to meet like with like if an opponent fights dirty			0
as @entity35 realised he was being out - classed he threw deliberate low blows , among other infractions of the rules			0
@entity0 says : ‘ i had to get into the holding and elbowing as well			2
the days of only trading clean shots are long gone in boxing			0
you have to get down and dirty if necessary			0
’ the mighty @entity1 revealed the same philosophy as he dealt with @entity23 ’s relentless attempts to rough him up and @entity0 adds : ‘ @entity1 is very clever at holding and the use of his elbow , forearm and the inside of the glove			1
that ’s another reason why fighting him would be very difficult – like a physical chess match between us – but i really do think i am the one who can prevent him going through his career undefeated			0
’ after his performance against @entity35 there will be less scoffing at @entity0 ’s self - confidence , whoever he fights next			1
tough night : @entity23 gave @entity1 a fight before losing by majority decision at the @entity26 @entity152 and tumble : @entity23 did not give @entity1 a minute 's peace over their 12 - round battle @entity159 ’s dramatic re-emergence from drink and drugs rehab is raising hope that he can put an end to the cold war between rival promoters which is preventing so many potentially great fights taking place			1
one of his first actions has been to call a truce with @entity169 after years of bitterness between their respective corporations			2
this has caused a schism within @entity175 , whose chief executive @entity176 has vowed never to return to doing business with @entity169 , whose @entity179 company boast @entity180 as their flagship fighter			2
@entity176 is considering his future and may move to @entity183 , for whom @entity175 are operating partners			0
@entity159 and former banker @entity176 have built @entity175 into boxing ’s biggest promoters and as the former @entity189 and world champion returned to the public spotlight hours before @entity1 ’s fight with @entity23 in @entity16 , he said : ‘ no - one is dismissing @entity176 and i want him to continue making great fights like this one , which is his job			1
happier times : @entity176 ( left ) and @entity159 have been at loggerheads in recent weeks ‘ but i have a vision of where this company can grow and no - one will stop me realising it			2
if we can work with @entity169 it will be good for boxing , so why not ? ’ @entity176 cites problems in the past and there is talk of a power struggle but @entity159 says : ‘ i want to offer an olive branch to @entity176			1
i want him to stay			0
but i have to look after myself , my family and the good of boxing , this sport i love			0
‘ our company is not called @entity175 for nothing			0
i am the president and the major shareholder			0
’ his peace - making with @entity169 will have the support of boxing fans the world over , even if a long - awaited super-fight between @entity1 and @entity180 is not a consequence			1
@entity1 is in effect his own promoter and he continues to refuse to work with @entity169			1
but there are a lot of other exciting match - ups to be made between the rival stables of boxers			2
@entity180 v @entity0 , for starters			2
the football - like crush as a crowd of some 16,000 charged their way out of the @entity26 on saturday night had been an accident waiting to happen			1
more than 20 people , several of them children , were hurt and taken to hospital after panic set in			0
by luck , none of the injuries were serious but the incident highlights exit problems at this arena			0
there has been a lot of pushing and surging after several fights here , as the spectators funnel out of multiple doors into a comparatively narrow indoor walk - way to the casino			2
there was also a warning the afternoon before when hundreds of fans hoping to see the weigh - in arrived after the arena was full and were caught up in that bottle - neck			0
false reports of a gun - shot – after a bollard crashed to the floor - aggravated the situation on fight night			2
the organisers could do worse than consult @entity113 authorities who have become expert at controlling football crowds			0
respect : people were crushed leaving the @entity26 prior to the post-fight press conference			0

@entity0 is not confident @entity1 will fight him in november
also does not believe @entity8 will fight @entity54 for @entity52 world title
@entity159 has made peace with @entity169 , raising hopes of *cross-promotional* fights
the football - like crush at the @entity26 was an accident waiting to happen
