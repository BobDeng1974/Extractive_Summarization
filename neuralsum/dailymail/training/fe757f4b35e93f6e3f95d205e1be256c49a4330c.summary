' at a summit with internet firms and experts earlier this month , mr @entity38 announced a new criminal offence of sexual communication with a child is to be created , closing a staggering loophole in the law			2
paedophiles who currently solicit explicit pictures of children routinely escape punishment if it ca n't be proved they have received an illegal image			2
but the new law will allow police and prosecutors to pursue those who send text messages or ' fish ' for victims online , irrespective of the outcome of their behaviour			0

' the @entity165 's research shows that there has been a 168 per cent increase in the number of children being counselled by @entity170 about online sexual abuse – averaging seven contacts a day to its helpline			0
@entity174 , @entity165 chief executive , hailed the announcement as ' a victory for our flaw in the @entity180 campaign but more importantly a major step forward in preventing online child abuse '			2
there are a number of steps that parents can take to safeguard their children while online - on tablets , laptops and desktop computers			1
the @entity26 @entity190 offers parents , teachers and children advice on what they can do to make sure that children are able to use the internet safely			1
it suggests parents take the following steps			0
have ongoing conversations with your children about staying safe online			0
the @entity190 suggests parents start by asking their children what sites they enjoy visiting and what they do to stay safe online			0
they could also ask children whether they know where to go for help online			0
use tools on social networks and other online services , eg @entity215 privacy settings parents should think about the sites their family uses and take a look at which services and features the sites have that might be helpful			0
it recommends : ' talk to your children and make sure they know how to use the tools on the sites and services they use			0
' decide if you want to use parental controls on your home internet the 4 big internet providers in the @entity26 – @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity234 - provide their customers with free parental controls which can be activated at any time			1
but no filter or parental controls tool is 100 per cent effective , and many of the risks that young people face online are because of their own and other ’s behaviour			0
understand devices and the parental control tools they offer the @entity26 @entity190 recommends parents start by talking with their child about using their device safely and responsibly and agreeing a set of family rules			1
rules could cover : not meeting up with people they have only met online , how much they are allowed to spend on apps , what websites it ’s okay and not okay to visit , and whether their phone should be switched off at night			0
get @entity258 , a public / private sector partnership supported by @entity260 , adds that it is sensible to set these boundaries before children get their first device with internet access			0
it advises parents to their child about the kind of content they see online			1
it says : ' they need to understand the importance of not sending other people - whoever they are - pictures of themselves naked			0
' it adds : ' explain to your child that being online does n’t give them anonymity or protection , and that they should n’t do anything online that they would n’t do face - to - face			2
