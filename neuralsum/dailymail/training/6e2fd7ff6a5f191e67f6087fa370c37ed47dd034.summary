by @entity0 published : 04:56 est , 4 november 2013 @entity2 : 10:52 est , 4 november 2013 for fifty years , farmer @entity3 lived without running water			1
from the age of 21 , he was forced to take a bucket back and forth to a tatttered water pump at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , just so he could have a bath or pour himself a glass of water			1
but now , the 72 - year - old has been connected to a water mains for the very first time , and celebrated by turning the tap , filling his kettle and making a cup of tea			1
into the 21st century : @entity3 , 72 , can now make himself a glass of water without having to walk to a water pump after almost 50 years without running water @entity26 routine : he would have to take a bucket to the tattered pump if he ever wanted water the farmer has been going back and forth to a tattered water pump in a ditch 50 yards away since his parents moved to the property in 1962			1
now , after having to rescue unlucky frogs from the 166 - year - old contraption at the break of dawn he can enjoy quality @entity39 around the clock			1
' i 'm delighted , ' said mr @entity3 , who kept his bath full with water while the workmen from @entity46 dug around his 84 - acre farm just in case the supply ran out			1
' having running water makes my life so much easier now			1
it 's fantastic just knowing when i turn on the tap - water is going to come out			1
work : mr @entity54 , pictured working in the dairy , moved to the farm in 1962 when he was 21 - years - old property : the pump used on the farm in @entity9 , @entity10 , was installed 166 years ago tough : the farmer has suffered many winters without any water at all , but can now enjoy @entity39 around the clock ' it 's a real pain having to thaw out your water supply every winter or worry about it drying up in the summer			1
i think it 's marvellous now i have a mains supply and they say it is better water too			2
' bachelor mr @entity3 inherited @entity75 , built in 1837 , from his father in the late 1960s but he was happy to carry on using the well - which involved taking water from a tank filled by gravity from water streams			1
he would wake up at 5.30am each day and get the water after he tended to his animals , including a pet cow called @entity84 , 60 cattle and four dogs			1
but times were difficult when his rickety water pump , which channels water from moorland streams , failed and he was left with no other option but to fix it time and time again			1
finally : he is now able to make a cup of tea by simply turning the tap and filling his kettle early rise : he would get the water after waking up at 5.30am each day to tend to his animals , which includes a cow called @entity84 , 60 cattle and four dogs despite the monotonous routine , he never thought about getting running water installed until the offer arrived			1
under a new Â £ 3m scheme , @entity46 have extended their water network to more remote parts of the valley where the farmer lives , so supplies will be piped to him and more than 30 other properties in the area			1
' having a well and no running water was like having a wooden leg , ' said mr @entity119 , who has not owned a working television for 14 years and builds radios to communicate via @entity122 with enthusiasts as far afield as @entity124 and @entity125			2
handed down : bachelor mr @entity3 inherited @entity75 from his father in the late 1960s ' if you 've got one , you make do with it and carry on			1
the tank could pack up at any time and there would be no water to draw and i just to go without			2
' it used to always seem to pack up on @entity136 or @entity137 morning			2
but when you 're used to using something you just carry on , it does n't occur to you to change			0
' ' now it 's going to make a tremendous difference			0
some days i do n't have the energy i used to have			0
it 's going to give me so much more time - i 'll feel ten years younger			2
' it 's going to be lovely to have clean , clear water because there was a lot of pollution in the other one			2
in spring i would get little frogs stuck in the pump and i would have to pull them out			2
now the best thing is the water is just there			0
i do n't have any problems now			0
now if i do have a problem i just ring the company up and they sort it out			0
' some people say , ' how can you live like that ? ' and i say ' well how do you think people looked after themselves 1,000 years ago ? ' that 's where people got water from			0
' content : despite the monotonous routine , the farmer did not think about being connected to a water supply until he was offered one he added : ' we are so lucky in this country having beautiful clean water			0
we should appreciate it more			0
but i 'm tremendously grateful for what 's happened			0
i have spent quite a lot of time this year messing about with the pump			1
' usually i have enough water to last through winter but this year i did n't have enough			2
it 's run out through winter before and you just have to fix it			0
' @entity181 , the @entity46 project co-ordinator said : ' it seems ironic that these properties are so close to our reservoir and yet they do n't have mains water			0
' we 're going to put that right and there will be a lot of activity this autumn as we lay the new pipes			0
we 've planned the work outside peak times and we are keeping the pipeline away from major highways as much as possible			0
' in 2010 , only 30,021 out of more than 21 million households in @entity197 and @entity198 were not connected to the mains supply			0
@entity200 began being pumped to @entity202 houses in the middle of the 19th century after people had previously relied on rivers and wells for their water .			0

@entity3 , 72 , moved into his remote farm near @entity10 in 1962
would wake up at 5.30am every morning to go to 166 - year - old water pump
he spent some winters without any water at all when the water pump failed
says his life his ' so much easier ' knowing water will come out from the tap
