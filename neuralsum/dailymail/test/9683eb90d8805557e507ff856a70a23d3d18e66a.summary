@entity0 and her team - mates are on the brink of making history			1
on saturday , at the 161st @entity7 - @entity6 , the women ’s crews will battle the same @entity9 course as the men , who will follow an hour later			1
after decades of campaigning and 88 years since the first women to race were jeered by male spectators , they get equal billing			1
and for @entity17 ’s grandfather , 85 - year - old @entity16 , from @entity18 , it will be a momentous day			2
he is not up to the journey to watch his granddaughter compete for @entity21 but will still see the race , which will be televised for the first time			1
@entity17 , 21 , said : ‘ i remember when i was 14 watching with my dad and my brother and saying “ are there going to be women on ? ” they laughed — not in a malicious way — and said : “ there are n’t any women , you could cox i guess ”			1
so the fact that 10 years on there is a women ’s race on the @entity32 and i ’m in it is pretty remarkable			1
it ’s so wonderful that my grandfather will be able to watch it , too			2
’ @entity0 ( left ) and @entity44 of @entity21 women 's boat crew at @entity43 in @entity47 @entity48 gave up her regular stint on @entity52 ’s @entity51 coverage to present the event because she wants to send a message about the importance of women ’s sport			1
‘ it was a big decision to make , ’ said @entity48			2
‘ but there will never be another first women ’s @entity6 on the @entity32			2
’ her statement was welcomed by @entity44 , the @entity21 president			0
‘ it brings the attention of another audience , people who follow @entity48 , ’ said @entity61 , 24			0
‘ maybe people who support the @entity51 disagree but they will at least be aware it ’s happening and that is a good thing			0
’ @entity17 , a third year @entity71 literature student and @entity61 , in her fifth year of veterinary medicine , rise at 5.30am each day for training , gym work and lectures , then it ’s back out on the river in the afternoon			0
@entity21 women 's boat crew including @entity17 ( front ) rowing the @entity9 @entity61 , @entity80 and @entity17 prepare ahead of the @entity6 next saturday until this year , the women ’s race was held a week before the men ’s at @entity84			1
the course was 1.2 miles compared with this year ’s 4.22 mile battle from @entity87 to @entity88			0
‘ at @entity84 it ’s straight , so conditions are largely the same the whole way down , ’ said @entity61			0
‘ @entity32 conditions change because the river bends			0
there ’s a different mental and tactical side , which is exciting			0
’ but @entity61 refuses to be seen as a pioneer			0
‘ the first women ’s race was in 1927 and there were a lot of people against it , talking about whether women should be rowing at all and what they should be wearing , so they were the pioneers			1
we ’re just carrying on in their footsteps , ’ she said .			0

after decades of campaign the women 's crews are to make history
