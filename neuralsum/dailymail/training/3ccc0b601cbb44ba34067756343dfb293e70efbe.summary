a warning for those planning to spend saturday night on january 31 outside a @entity3 club in the hope of inadvertently getting on @entity5 : do n’t bother			1
the window actually closes on monday february 2 at 11pm , having belatedly opened on january 3 , and what do we have to show with it being a week old ? @entity10			0
well , that may be a fib			0
we have @entity13 for one , joining @entity14 after may , and @entity16 ’s impending £ 30million deal as another			0
yet there remains a few that should be looking for the exit door themselves			0
@entity23 ’s @entity22 , @entity25 ’s @entity24 and @entity27 ’s @entity26 are among those , and here ’s why they ought to leave			1
@entity22 , @entity23 interested clubs : @entity30 , @entity31 @entity32 : £ 20m @entity34 stat : @entity23 would be joint - bottom of the @entity3 without @entity22 's goals @entity23 striker @entity22 has been linked with a move away from the @entity38 @entity22 did not look too pleased at scoring four goals past @entity40 in the @entity41 2,723 - percentage increase in wages since 2013 if he accepts £ 24,000 a week 4 - points directly earned via his eight @entity3 goals 4 - goals against @entity40 during 7 - 0 @entity41 win 187 - minutes - per - goal ratio 20 - @entity23 ’s only player to have played in every @entity3 game four goals against @entity40 and not so much as a smirk			1
@entity52 of the @entity41 ... @entity22 ’s dismantling of the @entity55 club was overshadowed by the 21 - year - old ’s refusal to celebrate , to smile , to show a smidgen of happiness for doing the job he is paid £ 12,000 per week to do			1
@entity63 ’s @entity62 last week coined the phrase ‘ to do a @entity22 ’ , which involves scoring , whether during a five - a - side match or on the playground , and sulking			1
it may catch on at @entity38 if the @entity68 international does n’t leave			0
his poker face could be interpreted as a cry for help ; a come and get me for potential suitors , those being @entity30 and @entity31			0
but £ 20m ? was that plucked from thin air by @entity23 , or created by agents after their 10 per cent ? neither			1
new @entity23 manager @entity78 will be desperate to keep hold of star striker @entity22 @entity22 ’s significance is outlined by the fact @entity23 would be joint - bottom of the @entity3 without him ; his eight goals , one every 187 minutes on average , have directly contributed four points			1
he is the only player to have featured in every @entity3 game ( 20 ) for @entity23 , and was named in @entity88 ’s @entity68 squad for the first time in november , too			1
against @entity27 on @entity91 , before his four goals against @entity40 , he scored the equaliser in a 1 - 1 draw and held a 100 per cent pass succession			1
perhaps the £ 12,000 is where the problem lies			0
@entity23 chairman @entity97 wants to double it , meaning his wages would have increased by 2,723 per cent since december 2013 , when he was on £ 850 per week			1
he ’s turned up late for three matches this season , the latest against @entity100 on @entity101 , and had to pay fines for his tardiness			0
time to go , @entity22			1
@entity24 , @entity25 interested clubs : @entity107 , @entity108 @entity32 : £ 20m @entity34 stat : @entity24 is the @entity3 ’s fastest player after being clocked at 35.3kph @entity25 midfielder @entity24 is the fastest player in the @entity3 35.3 - @entity24 ’s kph clocked speed ( the fastest in the @entity3 ) 101 - dribbles attempted , the seventh most in the @entity3 22 - chances created for @entity25 with two goals and one assist 967 - minutes played against @entity108 in @entity115 with @entity116 the @entity118 model			1
buy cheap , then sell for profit			0
it works for @entity121 , but not for @entity25			1
in @entity24 the owner has another piece of merchandise he can staple a £ 20m price tag to and put on the shelves for the january sales			1
@entity118 has a knack for selling his most valuable player			0
@entity130 ( £ 35m ) being one , @entity131 ( £ 23m ) another , arguably @entity132 ( £ 7.5m ) and @entity133 ( £ 10m ) , too			0
right on cue are serious concerns about another mvp being sold			0
@entity141 , in one of his final acts as manager , admitted @entity25 would be ‘ vulnerable ’ if a big club came knocking			2
there have been reports @entity25 issued a ‘ hands off ’ warning to @entity108			2
in fact the club told them they ’d have to pay handsomely			0
‘ i have ambition , ’ @entity24 previously said			2
‘ my goal is to play at the best clubs , playing the @entity154 , win trophies , but today i am a @entity156 and i am very happy			0
’ that was in december			0
come january @entity25 are 10th , out of the @entity41 and @entity158 , without a manager , and @entity160 at @entity161 are next			2
so , what would @entity24 leave behind ? the 25 - year - old has been named the @entity3 ’s fastest player after being clocked at 35.3kph against @entity165 , beating @entity166 ( 35 ) and @entity167 ( 34.6 ) , among others			1
he has attempted 101 dribbles , placing him seventh in the top 10 , two goals , one assist , and has created 22 chances			0
if @entity24 feels he can bring all this to @entity177 football , then that lies away from @entity178			2
the 25 - year - old has been linked with a move to @entity115 giants @entity108 @entity26 , @entity27 interested clubs : @entity107 , @entity30 , @entity31 @entity32 : £ 4m @entity34 stat : @entity26 has made the third-most clearances in the @entity3 ( 186 ) @entity27 may choose to cash in on @entity26 or risk losing him for free at the end of the season 75 - per cent of winning tackles 186 - clearances ( the third-most in the @entity3 ) 115 - headed clearances 22 - clean sheets with @entity26 involved out of 29 it ’s a timing thing			1
let @entity26 leave now , get £ 4m			2
let him leave in the summer , get nothing			0
his contract expires on june 30 and , because he is stalling negotiations , @entity26 will be free to go where he pleases in less than six months			2
if @entity27 are to make money , it ’s time to sell			2
they ’re looking less likely to steal a @entity154 place , having taken one point from nine against @entity23 , @entity107 and @entity160			1
next up , @entity200 at the @entity201			0
@entity202 , so keen on @entity26 , has sent scouts to every @entity27 game since november to watch the @entity206 captain			1
the 26 - year - old would n’t dominate headlines , nor break the bank with the £ 60,000 - per - week wages he is supposedly demanding , but can give defensive cover for @entity212 and @entity213			0
@entity107 boss @entity202 is said to be keen on bringing the @entity206 captain to the @entity214 @entity215 seems resigned to losing him , too			2
a one - liner or two from @entity215 : @entity26 wins 75 per cent of his tackles and has made the third-most clearances in the @entity3 ( 186 )			1
of those , 115 were headed clearances			0
he has featured in 22 of @entity27 ’s 29 clean sheets over the past three seasons , is based in @entity223 , and has been since 2010			2
‘ there is no future for @entity26 at @entity27 at the moment			1
his contract finishes on june 30			0
he has n’t said he ’s going to sign or that he ’s not going to sign			0
' ‘ if he is not going to sign a contract [ at @entity27 ] , i find it highly unlikely if it is not already verbally done [ elsewhere ]			2
’ @entity215 could and should cash in for something , rather than lose him for nothing			0
@entity234 ... @entity235 , @entity107 interested clubs : @entity237 , @entity238 price : loan @entity34 stat : @entity235 has made four league appearances for @entity107 , but 85 on loan for others @entity107 striker @entity235 's proposed move to @entity237 could benefit all parties @entity247 in 2011			1
now @entity237 ? how often can @entity202 promise to make use of @entity235 , only to give the 22 - year - old a bit - part role to play ? @entity253 can remedy that			1
he wants @entity237 to become the fourth city to welcome @entity235 from where he goes wasted			1
@entity253 , after all , can offer time on the pitch ; a luxury yet to be afforded in north @entity223 , despite @entity202 ’s assurances			2
' i ’ve got one or two in mind and maybe some from back home who would like the opportunity to come and play in @entity268 , ’ said @entity253			2
‘ if there ’s one market i know best at the moment then it ’s the @entity273 market			0
' @entity274 international @entity235 has failed to hold down a regular first team role at @entity107 no prizes for who the man that recently thwarted @entity279 was referring to			1
@entity235 , while open to signing a new contract with @entity107 , fancies the move , too			1
four @entity3 appearances , 39 minutes total , zero goals , zero shots on or off target , two chances created			1
the love affair at @entity107 continues			0
and so to the underdog story of the summer			0
the @entity290 allowed @entity274 , led by a seemingly unknown forward , to reach their first quarter - final in history			0
it got @entity235 noticed but @entity202 has no time for sentimentality			0
@entity235 ’s next destination should be @entity237 , where he is likely to get more than a minute or two , here or there , every so often .			1

@entity23 would be joint - bottom if it was not for @entity22 's goals
@entity27 ace @entity26 has been linked with a move to @entity107
@entity25 's @entity24 is the @entity3 's fastest player
@entity235 could be loaned out to @entity253 ' @entity237
