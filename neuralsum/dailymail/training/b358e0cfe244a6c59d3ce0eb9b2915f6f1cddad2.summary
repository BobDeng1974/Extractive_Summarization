every day in @entity1 , two people die waiting for a donor organ - and some experts believe this tragic situation needs a radical solution			1
currently you have to join a register if you wish to be an organ donor , an ' opt in ' system			1
but even if a person is on the register , some bereaved families still refuse to give permission			1
but from december 1 next year , @entity14 is changing to an ' opt out ' system , where doctors will presume people have agreed to donate their organs after death , unless they have registered an objection and specifically chosen to opt out			1
opt out , or ' presumed consent ' systems can either be ' hard ' - where the wishes of close relatives are n't considered , as in @entity26 , or ' soft ' - where families can refuse organ donation if they think the person would n't have approved , as in @entity31			1
@entity32 has no plans to follow @entity14 's lead			1
here @entity35 talks to two people affected by the issue			1
@entity38 had cardiomyopathy , a disease of the heart muscle no says @entity38 , although she could die waiting for a new heart @entity38 , 38 , is waiting for a donor heart			1
she 's divorced and lives in @entity44 with her children @entity45 chi , 13 , and @entity47 , ten			0
she was a hairdresser before she became ill. my heart consultant told me in february that i wo n't be here in two to three years ' time without a new heart			1
i 've since had the most devastating conversations with my daughter			0
she says : ' mummy , who 's going to look after me when you die ? ' i just say : ' i ca n't promise you 100 per cent they 'll find me a new heart in time , but we 're 100 per cent hopeful they will			1
' i ca n't lie to my children			1
they already know so much : they know i have cardiomyopathy , a disease of the heart muscle that means eventually it wo n't be able to pump blood round my body			1
they know i 've almost died once - i collapsed , and my heart had to be shocked back into a normal rhythm			0
you ca n't pull the wool over children 's eyes			1
all three of us have cried together			0
until eight years ago , i was fit and healthy			0
i danced , sang in a pop choir , had great friends , two wonderful children and loved my job			0
then , in march 2007 , i went to a nightclub with a couple of friends and collapsed on the dance floor			0
i was in intensive care for ten days and in hospital for seven weeks			0
i was fitted with an internal defibrillator , which shocks my heart back into a normal rhythm if it starts racing too fast , and everything seemed well			0
but one morning in spring 2012 , i suddenly felt so ill - clammy , sick and shaky			0
i saw my heart consultant and i 'll never forget his words : ' i think we should get you on the transplant list			1
' since then i 've had four calls from the hospital , with a possible donor heart			2
on each occasion , the organ was either diseased or not a good match			2
the last call was just last week			2
the ambulance arrived for me within an hour and i was prepped for surgery , but at the last minute they decided the heart was n't a good enough tissue match			2
i rarely cry but it hit me a few days later and then the floodgates opened because i do n't know how long i have left			2
i 'm only 5ft 1in and my chest cavity is small , so if the tissue type was the right match , technically , i could take a child 's heart if a small adult heart was n't available			2
it 's horrible and devastating even to say those words			0
and the only way i could take a child 's heart - or anyone 's heart - is if i felt the family would get a smidgen of comfort from knowing they had given me more time			2
that 's why , even though i am desperate to go on living for my children , i think donation has to be a gift - a personal choice - rather than an obligation			0
i do n't want anyone to feel their loved one 's heart was ' taken '			2
what if someone meant to opt out but did n't get around to it , so i got that heart against their wishes ? for me , that really matters			1
@entity38 is chronically ill and is waiting for a heart transplant in @entity14 the system will be ' soft ' , so families have a clear right of objection			1
but they are already dealing with the worst thing to happen to them , and the bedside of a dying relative is no place to have this conversation			0
i would be haunted for ever by that family 's feelings			2
but if my donor had signed up to the donor register or expressed a wish to donate their organs , my conscience would be clear			1
to join the @entity169 organ donor register , go to organdonation.nhs.uk or call 0300 123 23 23			1
and do n't forget to tell your family of your wishes			1
most importantly , i do n't think presumed consent will result in more organs becoming available			2
if relatives have n't had the conversation beforehand , then in the horror of the moment they will simply say no , as they do now			2
for me , it would be better to focus on raising awareness so more people choose to join the register			1
death is still such a taboo subject and not enough people know the facts about organ donation to make an informed decision			1
i 've met people who feel even talking about it is somehow tempting fate			2
registering as a donor wo n't make you more likely to die , but it might help someone after you 're gone			1
i think about death every day , but i still do n't feel comfortable with the idea of an opt - out donor register			1
@entity200 was diagnosed with cystic fybrosis @entity202 says @entity200 , who owes her life to a double lung transplant @entity206 , 27 , runs cake makers @entity207 from her home in @entity210 , @entity211 , where she lives with her parents			0
she had a double lung transplant on october 10 , 2011			0
when i was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis i was just two - and - a - half			0
the condition causes a build - up of sticky mucus in the lungs and digestive system , which has to be dislodged with daily physiotherapy and exercises			2
it dominated my childhood - mum was told i 'd probably die in my early 20s			0
when i was 16 my lung function began to seriously deteriorate ; by the time i was 20 i could n't move or even talk without getting breathless			2
at that point , i was put on the transplant list			0
i waited four years for donor lungs , and i ca n't describe how hard it was getting through every day			1
my back and chest felt broken from the effort of trying to breathe and i was virtually housebound			0
my friends were going to university and travelling , and all i could do was watch - not knowing if i 'd survive the next few months			0
i was on a lot of morphine , and breathing with a machine			0
i was fed via a naso - gastric tube , and @entity239 had to do everything - from washing to dressing me			0
one day a doctor asked : ' have you thought what you 'd like to happen if you do n't get a call ? ' she meant i needed to think about where i wanted to die			1
in september 2011 , the doctors told @entity239 it was unlikely i 'd make it to @entity249			0
then , on october 10 , i woke up to the sound of the phone ringing			0
there were some donor lungs , and the genetic match was as close as it could be			2
i went down for surgery at 4pm and came round the next evening			0
it took a while for me to breathe on my own , and i was terrified			0
but i remember looking at my nails and realising they were pink instead of blue for the first time , because oxygen was circulating properly			0
the transplant coordinator told me my lungs came from a young man			0
i could n't stop thinking about what he 'd been like and what his family was going through at the same time my family was celebrating my chance of living			1
@entity200 pictured a few days after her double lung transplant at @entity275 three years ago people i 've talked to have the most bizarre reasons for not being a donor			1
some fear that doctors wo n't fight hard enough to save their life , or that their organs might be taken before they 're dead			2
but more often , people just have n't got around to it			1
so we miss a huge number who 'd happily consent to give their organs - and that 's why i think an opt - out system would be better			1
but presumed consent is n't a quick fix			2
there 'll need to be more doctors , more beds , more transplant coordinators and more retrieval teams			0
and there has to be a more open discussion so people are aware they can opt out			1
you can sign up for an @entity169 donor card if even one more person gets their transplant as a result , i would rather have that one person saved			1
i have lots of friends who died waiting due to the lack of suitable donors			0
every year , on the anniversary of my donor 's death , i write to his family through the coordinator			1
sometimes i tell them something i 've done , but usually it 's just : ' i 'm so grateful and i 'm thinking about you			0
' i never receive a reply - and i do n't expect one			0
but i hope the family gets some comfort from the fact i 'm able to keep going because of something my donor did			1
i feel a responsibility to live my life not just for myself but for him - and for my friends who died waiting			0
there is a campaign to raise awareness of organ donation at livelifegivelife.org.uk .			0
