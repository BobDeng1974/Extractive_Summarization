by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 13:12 est , 6 december 2013 updated : 18:02 est , 6 december 2013 a long - awaited study by the @entity4 confirms a link between tainted tap water at a @entity8 base in @entity9 and increased risk of serious birth defects and childhood cancers			1
the study released late on thursday by the @entity4 's @entity18 surveyed the parents of 12,598 children born at @entity21 between 1968 and 1985 , the year drinking - water wells contaminated with chemicals from a leaky fuel depot and a dry cleaner were closed			1
even though parents of children born in the 1950s and early 1960s were not surveyed , the water was contaminated from august 1953 through december 1987			2
according to the @entity27 @entity26 , in the early 1980s it was discovered that two of the base 's water supplies were contaminated with trichloroethylene ( @entity32 ) , a metal degreaser , and perchloroetheylene ( @entity34 ) , a dry cleaning agent			1
@entity21 has since been cleaned up and now has a clean and highly regulated water source @entity37 ( left ) and @entity38 ( right ) underwent surgery while @entity38 was still pregnant with her to correct an opening on @entity37 's spinal cord that was the result of spina bifida @entity43 reports that parents reported 106 cases of serious birth defects and childhood hematopoietic cancers			1
of those , researchers said they could obtain medical records to confirm the diagnoses in only 52 cases @entity53 turned out to be the primary source of the @entity32 and @entity34 contamination in the well water provided to @entity57 , a military housing development			1
but subsequent testing revealed even more extensive pollution from an outdated , poorly maintained fuel farm in the @entity63 area , where the @entity65 hospital and housing for most of the enlisted men and their families were located the worst of the contamination occurred during the height of the @entity71			0
but records suggest that toxic substances began leaking — or were being intentionally dumped — into the ground almost immediately after the @entity75 carved a spot for the @entity77 out of the coastal pine forest at the mouth of the @entity80 in late 1941			0
the @entity26 website says that honorably discharged veterans who are able to prove they served in @entity21 during the period of contamination ( august 1953 - december 1987 ) may be eligible for compensation			0
disability compensation is processed on a case by case basis			1
evidence must show that the veteran has a current disease and that the illness is thought by a doctor to be related to the water contamination			0
the @entity4 study concludes that babies born to mothers who drank the tap water while pregnant were four times more likely than normal to have such serious birth defects as spina bifida			1
babies whose mothers were exposed also had an elevated risk of such childhood cancers as leukemia			0
the water contamination at @entity21 is once of the largest ones in history the cause of childhood leukemia is not always known , but yesterday the @entity4 found a definite link between the illness and the contaminated water at @entity21 according to @entity116 is a birth defect that affects the neural tube in the embryonic structure that eventually becomes the bay 's brain , spinal cord , and surrounding tissue			1
if spina bifida is severe , surgery may be necessary but may not entirely alleviate the problem			2
leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells			0
the cause of @entity127 is not entirely known but exposure to chemicals , such as the ones in the tap water at @entity135 between 1968 and 1985 , is one surefire cause			0
civilian @entity139 , head of environmental quality for the base , said that nowadays @entity21 drinking water is probably , ' the safest and most tested drinking water ' people could find			2
' we probably have the most aggressive sampling regime for our drinking water than anybody else in the nation , " he says			2
' maybe in the world			0

in the early 1980s it was discovered that two of the base 's water supplies were contaminated by @entity53 with trichloroethylene ( @entity32 ) , a metal degreaser , and perchloroetheylene ( @entity34 ) , a dry cleaning agent
the @entity4 study released yesterday proved a link between spina bifida , leukemia in children , and the contaminated drinking water
veterans are allowed to apply for compensation *benefits* on a case by case basis if they have a proven medical opinion that their illness is linked to the contaminated water
