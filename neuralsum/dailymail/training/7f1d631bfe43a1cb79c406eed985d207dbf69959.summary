@entity10 biochemist @entity9 has created ' @entity11 , ' which claims to be the world 's first caffeine - based topical energy spray			1
he said flagging workers can spray a ' shot ' of caffeine onto their skin without experiencing a strong buzz , loading up on unnecessary calories or being stuck with a nasty aftertaste like they might get from drinking energy drinks or coffee			1
biochemist @entity9 has created ' @entity11 , ' which claims to be the world 's first caffeine - based energy spray absorbed through the skin the website says the product ' can be taken in seconds , does n't make you crash , is more affordable than current products and is n't full of mystery ingredients			1
' mr @entity9 , 26 , and his venture capitalist business partner , @entity33 , 33 , are raising funds for their spray on crowd - sourcing site @entity36 and have already exceeded their $ 15,000 target			1
the patent - pending caffeine spray is an odourless liquid that is absorbed through the skin and distributed through the body over a number of hours to deliver a caffeine hit that apparently lasts longer than guzzling a cup of coffee			1
the creators claim the product ' can be taken in seconds , does n't make you crash , is way more affordable than current products , and is n't full of mystery ingredients			0
they recommend the product is sprayed on the neck or wrists , like perfume each small aluminum bottle of @entity11 contains around 160 sprays - the equivalent amount of caffeine to 40 cups of coffee and the creators say it is a much cheaper way of getting a caffeine fix than popping to a cafe			1
mr @entity9 told @entity66 that he came up with the idea as an alternative to coffee , which is ' like a roller coaster ride of energy , ' the @entity65 reported			2
in a bid to develop an alternative , the biochemist researched nicotine patches and asked his father , who has a phd in @entity77 to work with him to find out how caffeine can be easily absorbed			2
the only active ingredient in the spray is caffeine , which the pair found can naturally enter the human body through the skin by passing through cell membranes as it is very similar to nicotine in structure			2
the only active ingredient in the spray is caffeine , which the pair found can naturally enter the human body through the skin by passing through cell membranes and is very similar to nicotine in structure the scientists found that as caffeine is not easily dissolved in water , it is difficult to transport enough of the stimulant in a spray to have a significant effect			2
after months of research , they discovered they could increase caffeine â€™s solubility five-fold by using a simple derivative of a naturally produced amino acid , tyrosine			0
this breakthrough ' opens up a whole new realm of possibilities when it comes to energizing as effectively as possible without all the drawbacks and side effects , ' said mr @entity9			0
each spritz of @entity11 contains around a quarter of the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee , but apparently has the same effect as a full cup			0
the company said it is a cheaper and less calorific alternative to drinking a lot of coffee each spritz of @entity11 contains around a quarter of the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee , but apparently has the same effect as a full cup			0
the website said : ' the reason for this is our product not being ingested , is n't almost entirely metabolised by the liver before entering your system and becoming available to your body			0
' thus , a smaller amount of caffeine can have just the same effect as a very large amount of caffeine ingested through an energy drink or cup of coffee			0
' the founders of @entity11 have already reached and exceeded their $ 15,000 investment target on @entity36 where they are selling the product for $ 15 each as well as a ' zombie apocalypse stockpile ' of 52 bottles for $ 449 @entity11 's website recommends that users apply the spray in places where they normally spritz perfume , such as the neck or wrists , but warns users not to exceed 20 sprays a day			1
it claims that after spraying the product on the skin , users will feel ' awake and focused without being over-stimulated , ' which is common with coffee and energy drinks			2
' since our product enters your system gradually over a period of several hours , you wont have the ' buzz ' that you get from caffeine products you drink ( or the crash afterwards ) , ' it said			0
