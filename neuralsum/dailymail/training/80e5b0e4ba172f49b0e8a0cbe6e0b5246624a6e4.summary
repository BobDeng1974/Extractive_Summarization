during a routine ultrasound last february , they learned the baby that @entity2 was carrying had a facial cleft which had allowed brain tissue to seep out and form a golf ball - sized sac on his face			1
baby @entity16 was born on june 18 and , beating the odds , began to develop normally			1

anxious : the @entity23 were told baby @entity24 would only live a few hours after his birth walking miracle : the @entity23 are overjoyed at @entity24 's recovery brothers : @entity24 's brother comforts the baby after his surgery one year ago , the @entity33 's world turned upside down			1
the couple , already parents to seven children , were eager to find out the sex of the baby @entity2 was pregnant with and went for an ultrasound in february 2012			1
with five girls and two boys , they were excited to learn that their new addition would be a boy and they decided they would call their 8th child @entity24			2
but their excitement turned to fear when they learned the baby 's skull had n’t formed properly and there was a triangle - shaped gap from his lip up to his forehead , called a @entity55 midline facial cleft			2
with a gap in his head , brain tissue had seeped out and formed a golf ball - sized sac , called a encephalocele , that was resting near his forehead			1
complications : a routine ultrasound showed that the child had a massive sac of brain tissue growing on his face clinging to hope : after @entity2 learned last feb. that the condition might be fatal for the child , her other children began praying that @entity24 would survive doctors prepared the parents that the child would likely not survive the extremely rare condition , only found in an estimated one child every two to five years born in the @entity80 it was expected that @entity2 could carry the baby to term and that he would be born alive but would likely die within hours			1
' at first we were told he would probably die within a few hours and that we should do our best to enjoy the pregnancy , ' @entity84 said			2
' over time his prognosis got better , and the doctors agreed he 'd survive birth			0
but after that , they had no idea what may happen to him			0
it was a real @entity95 territory for all of us			0
' the @entity23 , who are strong @entity98 , leaned on their faith and spiritual community as they tried to wrap their heads around what was happening			0
they shared with their seven children that the baby would likely not live and while the baby grew in @entity2 's womb , she wrestled with the tragedy that likely lay before her			1
family : the seven @entity33 children have welcomed their baby brother with open arms faith : the @entity23 leaned on their faith and the support of their spiritual community love : @entity24 's older siblings having fun with their younger brother digesting the pain , shock and disappointment , @entity2 poured out her heart about the emotional roller - coaster ride she experienced in a series of heart wrenching journal entries , weaving in scripture as she worked through her emotions			1
' my hope is that people will not feel sorry for us , but please join us in our hopefulness			0
please join us in hoping and praying for @entity136 's will to be done in us and @entity24 … of course please pray for us for the grace to trust , ' the then - pregnant mother asked her readers shortly after she learned of the baby 's condition			1
in the course of the pregnancy , after a discouraging medical appointment , the mother clung to hope and wrote , ' today my heart says , yes , i believe in miracles ! i believe , if we pray , miracles will come out of @entity24 's short life			2
i believe @entity136 has a miracle in store , what exactly that will be , i do not need to know			0
' with the devastating prognosis , the family waited out the pregnancy and faced an uncertain future			0
then @entity2 gave birth via c - section on june 18 and @entity16 weighed 7 lbs , 8 ounces and measured 20 1/2 inches long			1
he lived longer than a few hours and overwhelmed his parents and the medical team as he began developing normally , despite the prominent bubble on his face			2
miracle : @entity16 stunned doctors with his miraculous survival growing : @entity24 began developing normally after his birth touching : @entity24 's big sister snuggles the little miracle ‘ things with @entity24 are going so much better than what they could have , we rejoice at every little victory ! ’ the family shared with their friends after @entity24 survived the delivery			1
in the months following @entity24 ’s birth , the parents were directed to dr. @entity180 , plastic surgeon - in - chief at the @entity182 , who advised them to come to @entity185 so @entity24 could undergo facial reconstruction surgery			1
dr @entity180 and a team of brain specialists worked for weeks to run through scenarios and prepare for possible complications in the lead to the december operation			0
they feared the blood loss during the procedure would be too much for @entity24 ’s tiny body in addition to the possibility of an infection but after weeks of preparation , felt confident at the prospects of a successful outcome			0
@entity204 : the @entity205 said they fell in love with @entity24 's face and had to adjust to his new look after his surgery then on december 18 , a team of 15 doctors gathered in an operating room at 9:30am to remove the brain tissue and fluid that had pooled inside @entity24 ’s encephalocele			1
with the sac removed from his face , dr @entity180 then performed reconstructive surgery on the baby ’s face to repair the clef and align the skull			1
the procedure ended at 3:30pm			0
the surgery ended up going more smoothly than expected and @entity24 spent the next three weeks in @entity225 recovering			2
' everything went according to plan thanks to the amazing efforts of the whole team , ' dr @entity180 said			0
the @entity230 said they owe so much to the efforts @entity233 , who was optimistic about @entity24 's condition when no one else was			0
doctor : dr @entity180 with his little patient after the surgery ' this doctor believed in @entity24 's life as being valuable and worth all that went into saving him , ' @entity2 wrote in thanks			2
' this doctor made it possible for us to come out for a second opinion and then he made it possible with insurance for @entity24 's surgery to be covered			0
' with his condition stabilized after three weeks , the parents returned to @entity4			0
as the family and their church continue to pray , they are thanking @entity136 for the miracle that is unfolding in @entity254			0
' the day @entity24 was born , a group of friends had a tree planted in our yard in his honor , ' @entity1 said			1
' i remember thinking , 10 years from now , i ’m either going to look at that tree and think of the son i lost , or watch him climb its branches			0
right now , thanks to so many wonderful people at @entity182 ’s and beyond , i 'm excited to watch him hanging from that tree as they both grow bigger and stronger			0
