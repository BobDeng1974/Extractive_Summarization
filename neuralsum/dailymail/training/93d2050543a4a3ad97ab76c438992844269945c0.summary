@entity0 remembers the moment vividly			1
he was at @entity4 ’s @entity3 training ground when the phone call came that would put his life on hold			1
his baby daughter was in hospital with suspected meningitis			1
‘ it was pre-season and we ’d been training , ’ recalls @entity0			1
‘ i got a shout that @entity16 had been taken into hospital but my doctor told me it was nothing to worry about so it was a real shock when i got there and saw her			2
it was clear it was serious			2
she was three months old , so fragile			2
’ it had been just two years since he and wife @entity25 had lost their second child , @entity26 , to stillbirth			1
was this really happening again ? @entity0 , pictured playing against @entity30 , has spoken of his daughter 's illness @entity4 midfielder @entity0 poses with his family - including @entity34 ( left ) who had to battle against meningitis ‘ seeing your child like that is the worst thing in life , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ it ’s horrible , something you never forget			2
nothing else matters but you feel so helpless			2
thankfully , babies are tough			2
’ after an agonising two weeks of intensive care and attention , @entity16 pulled through			2
indeed those fighting qualities mean that @entity16 , fully recovered , is the livewire of the household and she is happy to share the limelight with older sister @entity51 , 12 , and the latest @entity0 addition , baby brother @entity51			1
‘ she ’s as bright as a button , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ she ’s two - and - a - half now and running around everywhere			2
it ’s lovely to come home from football to relax and see her and the other two playing so well			2
it ’s great hearing her little laugh around the place and she ’s got her big sister doing everything for her			0
‘ the whole experience of what we have been through has definitely brought us closer together as a family unit and you appreciate every moment that little bit more			0
’ the gratitude felt by @entity0 and his wife to those who cared for @entity16 is expressed in @entity25 ’s continued push to raise funds for @entity75 neonatal charity and @entity77 now : running marathons and sky - diving from 10,000 feet			1
‘ i just go to watch , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ besides , i ’m scared of heights			0
’ the sense of joie de vivre in their @entity84 home has been aided by @entity51 ’s arrival			0
now seven months old , he is already accustomed to supporting dad ; resplendent in @entity4 kit , he proved a lucky omen on his first game against @entity90 in march when @entity0 scored in a 3 - 3 draw			1
@entity4 2 - 2 @entity92 @entity93 0 - 0 @entity4 @entity94 3 - 0 @entity4 @entity4 0 - 2 @entity95 @entity96 0 - 1 @entity4 @entity4 4 - 0 @entity97 @entity98 2 - 1 @entity4 @entity4 2 - 2 @entity30 @entity0 and family spend their precious time together at the local safari park or the occasional trip to @entity102 but , like any footballer , out on the pitch is where @entity0 finds his escape			1
he has been at @entity4 since 2008 and it ’s fair to say he has had his share of ups and downs			1
an often underrated midfield talent with an eye for goal , he was signed by @entity114 , flourished under @entity115 before playing for @entity116 , fell out of favour under @entity118 then was given a fresh chance by @entity120			0
now under @entity121 , he is an ever - present and part of @entity125 ’s promising @entity124 campaign			1
‘ when things happen like with @entity16 , football is the last thing on your mind , nothing else matters			0
unfortunately , it coincided with @entity118 not wanting to pick me , ’ remembers @entity0			1
‘ not having a game to look forward to , it was a difficult time			0
a few clubs came in and i came very close to leaving but the deals did n’t go through			0
@entity120 then gave me a fresh chance , i had a run of games , signed a new deal and @entity121 has kept faith in me			1
it ’s been great to get back playing			0
’ @entity125 international @entity0 has been an ever - present for @entity4 so far this season @entity0 , pictured celebrating with team - mate @entity141 , scored in his side 's 4 - 0 win against @entity97 in those frustrating times @entity0 sought advice in the shape of coaches @entity147 and @entity148 and drew support in the shape of team - mate @entity151 , who left the club after being banned for his quenelle gesture which was deemed anti-semitic			1
‘ @entity154 was always someone who said i should be playing and when someone of his ability and calibre says that about you it gives you a lift , ’ he says			0
‘ i was sorry to see him go			0
obviously circumstances dictated it but , despite what is said about him , @entity154 was always a nice , calm guy around the place			0
’ despite an inauspicious start this season , @entity4 have started to find their rhythm and results are mirroring performances , as reflected in monday ’s 2 - 2 draw with @entity30			1
‘ @entity121 has brought a real freshness to the club , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ he ’s very thorough			0
whether we are playing a lower league team in the cup or @entity98 , he treats everyone with the same respect , we have a gameplan for every opposition and he ’s made training enjoyable with plenty of variation			2
he ’s serious about what he does but we can have a laugh with him too			0
’ @entity4 ace @entity185 could come up against childhood friend @entity187 ( right ) at the weekend @entity121 had to rebuild @entity4 ’s squad in the summer but managed to keep the core group and nurture talent such as @entity191 striker @entity141			1
‘ there ’s a few of us such as @entity194 and @entity195 who have been here a while and that has helped the transition and the squad to gel quickly but credit to @entity141			2
he has worked really hard and is going to be a great player			0
he ’s already showing what he could achieve and hopefully there ’s a lot more goals to come from him			0
’ this weekend , @entity0 faces childhood friend @entity187 of @entity205			1
‘ we know each other well from schoolboy days and we roomed together with @entity125			0
he ’s a good player and a good friend but i hope he has a stinker on saturday			0
‘ seriously though , every week is an exciting test in the @entity211 , you ’re up against some of the best players and the best teams in @entity215 but , as against @entity30 , we ’ve matched many of them			0
we ’ve got a good team developing			0
there ’s a freshness and togetherness about the place , like a family bond and we feel we can get stronger			0
’ after his experience , that ’s something @entity0 can vouch for			1
