it just had to be him			0
proud son of @entity3 , @entity5 ball - boy , @entity7 trainee , there are few people more qualified to settle a @entity10 than @entity11			1
he did it here in the 90th minute , to the unmitigated delight of the @entity3 fans up in the gods			1
@entity11 had scored in the last two @entity17 derbies at @entity18 , both of which ended in 3 - 0 wins for @entity3			1
neither goal will have felt quite as sweet as this one , though			0

@entity11 made the break from a @entity5 corner after @entity39 had produced a magnificent save to tip @entity49 ’s long - range effort over the bar			1
the ball was played wide to @entity99 and his cross was cushioned into @entity11 ’s path by substitute @entity69			2
@entity11 took a touch and then took aim , volleying left - footed past young goalkeeper @entity30			2
for the third season running , the @entity3 bench spilled on to the @entity18 turf in celebration			1
in total , they have beaten their bitter rivals four times in a row now , a club record			0
for @entity115 , the statistics make less happy reading			2
just one win in eight derbies and none at home			0
worse still , the remarkable revival that saved his job is starting to go into reverse			0
eight goals conceded in league and cup in the space of a week to @entity129 and @entity130 and now this			0
next up , it ’s @entity133 at @entity134 on @entity135			0
it would have been pointless wishing the @entity5 manager a merry @entity138			2
@entity27 , on the other hand , will enjoy his yuletide after maintaining a remarkable success rate against @entity5			1
he scored six goals in 13 games against them as a player and has now won all five meetings as a manager with @entity148 and @entity3			2
sir @entity149 once described him as the ‘ scourge of @entity5 ’ and sunday ’s events will only add to the legend			0
@entity3 boss @entity27 looks towards the travelling fans as he celebrates @entity11 's late strike @entity155 suffered two cuts to his face after colliding with the post while attempting to challenge @entity99 ( left ) @entity42 suffered a cut to his right cheek and a cut above his right eye after the @entity5 defender collided with his side 's goal post players from both teams signal to the bench as referee @entity42 ( right ) calls for the @entity5 medical team to treat the injured @entity42 @entity42 receives treatment from the @entity5 doctor before temporarily leaving the field on sunday afternoon yet it all started so badly for the @entity174			1
@entity175 withdrew after injuring himself in the warm - up , which meant @entity60 was called off the bench at short notice to partner @entity61 in central defence and @entity62 switched to left back			1
it would have been a difficult enough situation in any game , but even more so amid the white - hot atmosphere of the 151st @entity184			0
‘ it was a unique , strange back four and we kept a clean sheet , ’ said a proud @entity27 afterwards			0
the new set - up invited early pressure from @entity5 and @entity63 got the pleasantries underway in the opening seconds by upending @entity41			2
@entity60 picked up the first of seven yellow cards in total for a foul on @entity52 , quickly followed by @entity5 skipper @entity43 for a cynical knee into the back of @entity99			1
at times it felt as though referee @entity42 was n’t so much writing names in his notebook as checking them off , such was the predictability of the bookings			0
former @entity3 favourite @entity47 and @entity45 trod a fine line before @entity45 was booked for smashing into the back of @entity68 and @entity47 for a nasty late challenge on @entity67			0
the latter was lucky not to see red shortly afterwards when the referee chose to ignore another tackle on @entity66 and call play back for an earlier , less serious infringement			0
if the transgressions were being committed fairly evenly , @entity3 — without a win in six league games before sunday — certainly had the best of the chances before half time			0
@entity68 somehow headed wide from barely a yard out after @entity11 ’s free kick had found him unmarked at the far post			1
and when @entity66 caught @entity5 off - guard with a superb , first - time pass curled over the top of their defence , @entity99 stretched out a foot to volley past @entity30 but saw his effort come back off the bar			2
@entity155 hit a post soon after the restart but , painfully for the @entity5 centre back , it was with his face as he headed clear under pressure from @entity99			1
the @entity231 defender looks on as he is treated by the @entity5 medical staff midway through the second half @entity68 ( right ) guides a powerful header towards goal as he looks to break the deadlock during the @entity184 @entity5 boss @entity115 gestures to his players during the second half at @entity18 @entity42 had lengthy treatment on and off the pitch before returning to a hero ’s ovation with a nasty swelling and cut under his right eye that required a ‘ couple of stitches ’ , according to @entity115			1
@entity3 wasted another wonderful opportunity in his absence when @entity67 nonchalantly placed the ball wide with only @entity30 to beat , and @entity11 did likewise after cutting inside @entity43			1
@entity27 was ready to take off the former @entity249 winger			0
considering @entity11 ’s record in this fixture , what was he thinking ? @entity5 sensed it might be their day and surged forward — carelessly so , in hindsight			1
@entity39 saved from @entity52 , substitute @entity48 and then @entity49 in the moments before @entity11 struck to send the @entity3 fans into raptures once again			2
it was a sickening blow for @entity5 but one they took on the chin			0
efforts off the pitch to ease tensions in one of the most passionate local rivalries appeared to have paid off with little sign of the ugly scenes that have marred the fixture in recent years			0
no horses were punched in the making of this derby			0
and that has not always been the case here			0
