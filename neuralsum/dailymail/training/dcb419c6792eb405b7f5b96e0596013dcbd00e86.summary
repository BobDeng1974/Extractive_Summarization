actress @entity0 has abandoned five decades of support for the @entity2 and announced that she would vote for ' almost any other ' party at the general election , partly in protest at @entity7 's support for recognising the @entity9 state			1
the star of stage and screen gave a dim assessment of the present shadow cabinet , telling the magazine standpoint : ' the @entity17 brigade ? i ca n't , in all seriousness , go into a booth and put my mark on any one of them			1
' ' for the first time in five decades , i shall not be voting @entity2			2
' @entity0 with @entity24 , the actor , and @entity26 , who served under two @entity2 premiers @entity0 with her late husband , @entity28 , who canvassed for @entity29 in the 1945 general election @entity0 , who is @entity31 , reserved her most hostile comments for the @entity34 's decision to back a symbolic commons vote in favour of recognising the state of @entity38 alongside @entity39			1
she wrote : ' my late husband , @entity28 , canvassed for @entity29 in the 1945 general election			1
" in them days , " said the father in his seminal television play @entity44 , " they handed you your @entity2 membership just after your circumcision			2
" they gave with one hand and took away with the other			2
' she said that she had a ' sneaking suspicion ' that @entity54 – who was unexpectedly beaten to the leadership by his brother in 2010 – may return strengthened by his time out in the real world '			1
' i 'm an actress , @entity60 , and i am often commended for my timing , ' she wrote of the @entity35 vote			1
' frankly , my dear , yours sucks			0
' the world is exploding around us			0
@entity67 is beheading our civilians while raping and pillaging across @entity69 and @entity70			0
presidents [ @entity73 ] @entity72 and [ @entity75 ] @entity74 are playing such heavy - handed games that we do n't know which rebel group to support			0
' @entity78 may be about to see a replay of @entity80			0
@entity82 terrorism in every spot on the globe and if one @entity31 had been responsible for any of those bombings , there would , i am afraid to say , have been another @entity88			0
' at this point in our history you choose to back these footling backbenchers in this ludicrous piece of propaganda ? ' @entity0 sharing shoes with former @entity2 leader @entity97 ( left ) and as @entity98 stabbing @entity99 in the back ( right ) she went on : ' may i remind you that no one is tunnelling into @entity102 or sending rockets into @entity104 , yet we seem to have every right to bomb the living daylights out of @entity70			1
conclusion : one law for the @entity39 , another law for the rest of the world			0
' @entity0 also took a swipe at mr @entity7 's awkward eating of a bacon sandwich in front of the tv cameras during the local and @entity119 election campaign in may			1
mr @entity7 , who is from a secular @entity31 family , had told her he wanted to ' learn more about his religion of his birth ' by attending a traditional @entity124 dinner at her home			0
' two days later he was all over the papers , knocking back a bacon sandwich , ' she said			0
' now there is nothing intrinsically wrong with a secular jew chomping on a thinly sliced , pan-fried pig rump — my late husband , before we were married , had been known to queue up for such a thing from the catering van on an early morning film shoot			1
that was fine with me			0
i just could n't kiss him			0
' so , come election day , i shall give my vote to another party			1
until my party is once more led by mensches , ' she concluded - using the @entity149 term for ' a person of integrity and honour '			0
it seems unlikely the actress would lend her support to @entity156 - after the eurosceptic party leader @entity157 sought to blame one of her best - known roles for too many young people going to university to study poor quality degrees			2
the star 's well - known 1980s @entity165 television advert , where she told her grandson that having an ' ology ' made him a scientist , meant now there were lots of students ' getting ' ologies ' , mr @entity157 said			2
' i blame @entity0 for the whole thing			1

actress can not in all seriousness vote for ' the @entity17 brigade '
@entity0 's late husband , @entity28 , canvassed for @entity29 in the 1945 general election
has a ' sneaking suspicion ' @entity54 may return to *political* *frontline*
