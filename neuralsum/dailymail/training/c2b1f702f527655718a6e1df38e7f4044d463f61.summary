by @entity0 published : 13:50 est , 25 november 2012 updated : 08:15 est , 26 november 2012 it may only be the size of a grain of rice , but one species of beetle has managed to alter @entity7 ’s climate			1
the mountain pine beetle has increased summer temperatures in @entity10 by around 1c by destroying huge areas of forest , according to research			1
by reducing the amount of water pumped into the air by vegetation , the beetle has had as big an impact on local climate as forest fires , say scientists			1
destructive : the mountain pine beetle ( pictured ) has increased summer temperatures in @entity10 by @entity24 the increase in temperature has resulted from the sun 's energy heating up the ground surface instead of being used up evaporating water			1
the change in surface energy balance could alter cloud formation and rainfall , said the researchers writing in the journal @entity37			0
over the past decade , infestation by the beetle has affected almost 20 per cent of the whole of provincial @entity10 , a region of some 105,000 square miles of pine forest			1
threatened : the beetle has affected almost 20 per cent of @entity10 which has around 105,000 square miles of pine forest huge impact : the beetle has had as big an impact on local climate as forest fires ( file picture ) scientists made the link between the beetle attacks and climate after studying satellite data			1
they found that throughout the affected forest , the beetle had reduced summer evapotranspiration - the movement of water from the ground to the atmosphere by plants - by 19 per cent			2
author dr @entity60 , from the @entity61 , @entity62 , and colleagues wrote : ‘ land cover change in the case of insect infestation is less well ordered than in other types of disturbance , because both the scale of the impacted areas and the level of mortality within affected areas are variable			2
‘ future work is needed to understand the circumstances under which patchy and variable forest mortality drive significant secondary changes in regional climate			2
’ mountain pine beetles destroy pine trees by laying eggs under the bark			0
they also introduce a fungus into the wood that prevents the tree from repelling and killing the attacking beetle			0
the fungus stops the tree from getting the water and nutrients that it needs and the tree dies within a few weeks			0
cold winters with temperatures as low as @entity94 can kill off beetle populations but the insects recover quickly and resume their attack			0
the recent warm summers and mild winters have played a significant role in insect survival and the worsening of the problem .			0

the beetle has had as big an impact on local climate as forest fires
it has affected 20 *%* of @entity10 's 105,000 square miles of pine forest
