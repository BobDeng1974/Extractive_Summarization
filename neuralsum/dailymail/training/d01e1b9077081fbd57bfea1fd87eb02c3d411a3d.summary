millions of @entity1 holidaymakers could face passport checks at @entity3 if @entity4 votes for independence			1
families would be forced to undergo @entity8 - style identity checks as they returned to @entity1 by car on roads such as the @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
rail passengers would also need to prove they had a right to enter the country before boarding a train destined for @entity1 , in a similar regime to @entity20 journeys from @entity21			1
families would be forced to undergo @entity8 - style identity checks as they returned to @entity1 by car on roads such as the @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 papers published by the @entity26 government today show that , if checks are introduced , they could apply to tens of millions of journeys			1
there are an estimated 23 million vehicle crossings per year in both directions between @entity4 and @entity1 and seven million rail passenger journeys			1
it would be a huge logistical exercise , with the land border between @entity4 and the rest of the @entity36 extending for 95 miles from @entity37 on the east coast to the @entity39 in the west			2
the border is crossed by 21 roads and two railway lines			0
officials are considering how @entity26 will respond if the @entity4 public vote yes to ending the three centuries - old union on september 18			1
there are an estimated 23 million vehicle crossings per year in both directions between @entity4 and @entity1 they are concerned that , without the imposition of border checks , the country will become a ‘ back door ’ to @entity1 for migrants who would not otherwise gain entry			1
the @entity36 government has imposed a strict - points based system for workers from outside the @entity61 , which makes it very hard for low - skilled migrants to gain entry			0
but @entity65 leader @entity64 , the @entity4 first minister , has promised to introduce a far more lenient policy which has lower requirements for qualifications and the sum of money a migrant needs for ‘ maintenance ’			2
officials are concerned these workers , having been granted a visa by mr @entity64 , would simply cross the border to @entity1			2
there are also concerns over whether @entity4 would be forced to join the so - called @entity78 - which allows for entirely free movement within the borders of the @entity61			1
mr @entity64 has insisted he would be able to negotiate an opt - out for @entity4 in the event of independence currently the @entity36 has an opt - out of the regime , which effectively means there are no checks on a person moving from one country to another inside the @entity91			1
mr @entity64 has insisted he would be able to negotiate an opt - out for @entity4 in the event of independence			1
but @entity26 officials say the rules drawn - up by @entity96 clearly state that any country joining the @entity61 as a new member would automatically be expected to join @entity78			2
the immigration checks would cause massive disruption on both sides of the border			0
they could also harm tourism , as many of the millions of visitors given permission to enter the @entity36 each year visit both countries			2
@entity4 would also have to find money to fund its own borders regime - which currently costs @entity26 around £ 2billion a year			1
in a paper on immigration and citizenship published by the @entity36 government today , the @entity4 public are warned what they stand to lose			2
the document says : ‘ while the @entity36 ’s external border is proactively managed and protected , the movement of people and goods between @entity4 and other parts of the @entity36 is currently unhindered			0
‘ travel around the @entity36 does not require identification documents			0
there are neither customs inspections nor administration associated with the movement of goods			0
‘ the entire @entity36 currently benefits from unhindered movement between @entity4 and @entity1 , @entity134 and @entity135			1
@entity4 ’s borders with other parts of the @entity36 are busy ; both in terms of people and freight movement			0
‘ travel and the movement of freight between @entity4 and other parts of the @entity36 are no more difficult than travel within @entity4			0
‘ there is no requirement to carry a passport and there are no customs inspections or other administrative requirements			0
‘ officials at @entity26 deny they are engaged in political games or scaremongering			0
they insist that a country ’s rules on borders and citizenship are vital for security and national @entity158 particular , they highlight the major difference between @entity26 ’s stance on immigration and that of mr @entity64			0
the @entity65 ’s @entity163 on independence states : ‘ we plan to lower the current financial maintenance thresholds and minimum salary levels for entry , to better align them with @entity4 average wages and cost of living			0
’ the @entity26 said ‘ if a separate @entity4 chose to pursue a significantly different immigration policy from the @entity36 , then that could result in border controls between the two states			0
