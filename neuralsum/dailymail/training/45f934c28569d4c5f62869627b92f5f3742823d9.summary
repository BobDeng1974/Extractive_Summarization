@entity0 has challenged £ 43million misfit @entity1 to prove himself — and took a swipe at the on - loan striker ’s agent in the process			1
the @entity8 manager also claimed there will not be a january purchase to boost his side ’s chances of @entity14 qualification			1
@entity1 , 28 , has struggled for fitness and form since his deadline - day switch from @entity18 , scoring just three times in 13 appearances			1

but @entity52 responded : ‘ he has to prove himself			2
we have made a deal and everything is clear			0
it ’s not the end of the year so he has a chance			0
’ @entity8 have a clause in the £ 6m season - long deal that would allow them to sign @entity1 for a reported £ 43m , but @entity52 said that when it came to making the squad the player ’s value counted for nothing			1
‘ if a player cost £ 95m or £ 5,000 it ’s not any different for me , ’ @entity52 said			2
‘ you have to prove yourself			0
’ @entity52 declined to comment on how @entity1 , who is earning about £ 265,000 a week , had handled his omission but the striker travelled to @entity80 with the squad yesterday for the @entity83 clash with @entity27 today			1
@entity0 refused to answer questions about whether @entity1 and @entity85 would start at @entity27 @entity52 says @entity8 will not be active in the transfer window despite being linked with several defenders @entity52 ( left ) was pictured watching @entity8 's under 18s beat their counterparts at @entity90 earlier this week ‘ that is not for you or the media , ’ he said			1
‘ it is between the player and the manager			0
’ when asked if @entity58 ’ outburst was unhelpful , @entity52 said			0
‘ of course , but it does not interest me ’			0
@entity52 , who spent £ 156m in the summer , has been linked with two full backs , @entity100 of @entity101 and @entity55 ’s @entity102			1
but he insisted he was not expecting to spend big			0
‘ i do n’t think we shall be very active , ’ he said			0
‘ not many players at a certain level are available			2
‘ i have also said when we have to buy a player he has to be better than our players who are playing now and that is a difficult job			2
’ @entity100 has been linked with a move to @entity8 and wore their kit as a youngster ( right ) @entity85 ( left ) hobbled out of @entity8 's defeat at home to @entity55 last sunday @entity116 replaced @entity85 during the second half of the defeat to @entity55 at @entity35 former @entity8 midfielder @entity119 has criticised @entity52 ’s preference for a 3 - 5 - 2 system , claiming it means possession but creates few chances			1
despite his side not having one shot on target against @entity55 , @entity52 disagreed and pointed to his side ’s draw at @entity129 as proof it could work			0
‘ you pick up a match like that but i can pick up a match like @entity129 away , ’ he said			0
‘ a top - six club , and we played fantastic , were creative and could have scored a lot of goals			2
’ @entity30 is @entity8 ’s only injury worry against @entity27 but he should be fit to play			1
