a bitter war of words has erupted between a young woman and a butcher in @entity5 's eastern suburbs over exactly what happened when @entity7 , the girlfriend of @entity9 star @entity8 , tried to buy a chicken to cook up for a @entity12 - inspired feast			1
according to ms @entity7 , she was called names and told to go to ' an @entity16 butcher ' when she tried to change her chicken selection			1
however the butcher who was working at the shop on monday has hit back saying ms @entity7 is ' lying ' and trying to ruin the business			2
there were apparently more problems when she went to use her card to pay for the choice bird			0
' his eftpos machine was n't connecting so it was taking a while to process , and i felt really uncomfortable as he was clearly agitated , huffing and throwing things around , ' she said			0
ms @entity7 claims the man working at @entity45 in @entity24 swore at her and told her to leave , but the man working at the time said his customer was the one being rude the chicken ( pictured in front of @entity8 ) was cooked by ms @entity7 as part of a @entity12 - inspired feast ' another woman entered the shop at this point and she ordered sausages and paid in cash , and when she asked for a receipt he clearly ignored her on purpose so she actually lent over the counter and printed her own			1
' however , the butcher vehemently denies he called ms @entity7 names and said she was the one being rude on a day when he had been having issues with his eftpos machine			1
' she 's just a troublemaker , ' the butcher told @entity69			2
' i was very slow and she started having a go at me			0
' ms @entity7 ( pictured with mr @entity8 ) said the butcher told her to ' go to a f * * * ing @entity16 butcher ' but the man working vehemently denied any claims he swore at or abused the young woman ( pictured ) he told @entity69 that he 's trying to fit into @entity16 life but sometimes finds it hard to cope with attitudes in @entity24			1
ms @entity7 claims the butcher then asked her ' why do n't you just go to a f * * * ing @entity16 butcher '			1
' she said i 'm half @entity86 do n't speak to me like that , ' the butcher said			0
' i said if you 're going to be rude to me just take the chicken and go			0
' ' it 's a free country there 's about eight butcher shops in @entity24 , ' he added			2
ms @entity7 ( left ) and the butcher both said she did n't end up paying for the chicken she and mr @entity8 ( right ) later ate ms @entity7 said she had decided to leave the shop without making a purchase but the butcher then thrust the chicken at her			1
' i said not to worry about it and proceeded to leave while my purchase was still pending so he swiped the 1.5kg chicken at me and told me to " take it and f * * * off " , ' she claims			1
' i think i was just the victim of racial abuse , ' the young @entity24 woman wrote in a heated @entity108 post shortly afterwards			0
however the butcher said he simply wanted her out of the shop and did not swear at or abuse her at any stage			0
' she did n't even end up paying for the chicken , she got a free chicken , ' he said			0
ms @entity7 told @entity69 ' i have never been to this particular butcher before			2
' ' i 'm going to assume it was n't me who he was really angry at , however i just happened to be in there at the time			0
