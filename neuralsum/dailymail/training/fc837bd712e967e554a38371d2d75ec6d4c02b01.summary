a unique movie film of the 1924 @entity2 triumph of the @entity3 over the @entity4 has just been released by the @entity5			1
the 90 - year - old film lay undiscovered in the rafters of the garage of a home in @entity10 , @entity11 until an elderly woman died			1
the four - minute long video was recorded on highly flammable nitrate film stock and stored in cans in the elderly woman 's house			1
the unique footage was captured on highly flammable nitrate stock film which can spontaneously combust the footage shows short excepts of action interlaced with captions explaining to the viewer what 's happening despite only having one camera , the operator captures several thrilling pieces of action for the viewer the executor of the woman 's estate was the mother of @entity34 , who is a @entity35 at the @entity36			1
according to @entity38 of the @entity5 : ' while preparing the neighbor ’s house for sale , @entity34 ’s father found eight cans of film in the rafters of the detached and not climate - controlled garage , a space we archivists would not normally recommend for long term storage of motion picture film … especially since these reels were labeled as nitrate film stock			1
' now , nitrate film is flammable , creates its own oxygen when it burns , and we have 124 individual vaults at the @entity55 , each at 39 ° f / 30 % @entity57 , to store the nearly 140 million feet of nitrate we have in our collection			2
' once it starts to deteriorate , the degradation proceeds rather rapidly and given the temperature fluctuations to which these reels had been subjected for years , we were n’t optimistic about their condition			0
' the camera man recognised the chap second from left as 30th president of the @entity70 @entity69 experts believe the amazing footage was left in the garage and forgotten he wrote on his blog : ' so , we contacted @entity76 at the @entity77 , who retrieved the reels on our behalf			0
she confirmed the film as nitrate and arranged with a certified hazmat shipper at the @entity77 to send the batch to @entity85			0
' they were in astonishingly good shape ; only a couple evidenced any sign of slight mold or mildew			0
many of the reels were printed on @entity11 nitrate stock			2
@entity11 was a @entity96 competitor back in the day and its nitrate film has proven notoriously unstable , but miraculously not in this instance			2
the oldest film was from 1919 and the newest from 1926			0
' the house had been sold a couple of times over the years ; we expect the first owners placed the film in the garage , although we have no idea why			0
it seems very likely no one knew they existed until their discovery a few months ago			0
' experts made a digital copy of the film while the original nitrate film stock was photochemically preserved on safety film stock			1
a period appropriate musical score was even added to increase the atmosphere			0
the house changed owners several times over the past 90 years but no one had spotted the film cans luckily the person clearing the house was related to an expert in old film stock at the @entity5			1

unique footage lay hidden in a @entity11 garage for the past 90 years
it is the only known surviving footage of the 1924 @entity2 climax
the footage was shot on highly *volatile* nitrate film stock which burns easily
normally such film has to be stored in a temperature controlled vault
experts from the @entity5 managed to *salvage* the footage
they transferred the moving images into a digital file and added sound
experts thought that only photographs of the @entity151 survived
