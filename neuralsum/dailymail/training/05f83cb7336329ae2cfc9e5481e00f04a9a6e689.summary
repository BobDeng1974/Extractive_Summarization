by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 10 august 2012 updated : 09:52 est , 10 august 2012 perhaps it was a question of bear necessity , as one furry felon was filmed breaking into a sweet shop no less than seven times in 15 minutes to grab a host of sugary treats			1
the smarter than average bear , who could have given @entity10 and his mate @entity11 a run for their money , pawed his way through the @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 to find his favourite candies			1
these apparently include @entity21 toffee , chocolate - chip cookies dipped in caramel and milk chocolate appropriately named ' cookie bears '			1
scroll down to watch the hilarious video bear with paw - pose : the young animal makes his way through the front door and over to the counter of the sweet shop amazingly , the cheeky thief used the front door and did n't break a thing during the daylight raid			1
but once inside , the young black bear behaved , well , just like any other kid in a candy store			2
cautious at first , he simply grabbed the candy nearest to the registers , duly carried them outside and ate them			0
the sweet - toothed mammal then grew braver and returned to the shop another seven times for more , only leaving when a passing car scared him away			2
store owner @entity49 said the bear managed to pop open the door , because the deadbolt was not completely secured			2
the only evidence that her sneaky visitor left behind was some dirt on a counter and paper on the ground			0
there were n't even any wrappers left , so she assumes he ate those too			0
' he was very clean and very careful			0
he ate a lot of candy , ' said @entity67 of the bear break - in , which was first reported by the @entity69			0
sweet thing : the smell of candies lured the cheeky thief seven times into the @entity18 shop pick ' n ' mix : the discerning candy connoisseur selects which sweet treat he would like next bear with me : trying to stand , the furry felon takes a look at the whole selection pawfect : the thief finds what he 's looking for shortly before scampering off with his haul bears looking for leftover food are often sighted sniffing around people 's homes , cars and street rubbish in @entity18 's mountain towns , including @entity17 , which is the gateway to @entity96			1
but an ongoing drought this year has made the resourceful animals even more brazen in their search for food			1
the ' store owner added : ' we 're in their turf , and you just put up with these things when they happen			0
' watch video here :			0
