by @entity0 last updated at 8:29 pm on 13th september 2011 a @entity3 couple 's visit to @entity4 was to be the trip of a lifetime - a seaside hotel , a pier to stroll along and picturesque gardens to wander through			1
all this to enjoy while they were attending matches in which the @entity3 team were bidding to defend the trophy at the @entity14			1
but there was just one little hiccup - @entity17 and @entity18 could n't find the bayside @entity20 - or even the street in the @entity23 suburb of @entity24 that it was supposed to be located in			1
wrong one : the couple booked into this hotel in @entity23 , @entity27 , when they actually wanted to stay in one in @entity23 , @entity4 on the other side of the world : @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity4 convinced they had lost their way , or there was something wrong with the gps system in their rental car , they wandered into a shop to ask for directions			1
and it was n't long before the truth dawned on them			1
the hotel they had booked into online was the @entity47 in @entity23 , @entity48 , not a @entity47 in @entity23 , @entity24			1
' i booked into the right hotel , just in the wrong country , ' mr @entity49 said			1
' the @entity4 took the p * * * out of us because of our silly mistake but it was very nice and they were very friendly , ' he told the @entity58 newspaper			2
@entity61 rugby fans , the couple had decided to fly to @entity4 to watch their team play in the world cup and had set about finding a hotel in @entity24			1
@entity23 in @entity27 has been a popular resort for tourists since the early 19th century			2
its population is 98,000 , with roughly 25 per cent of those in the over 60s bracket - well above the national average			1
it is thought that they retire there because of its ' quiet charm and elegance			0
' the town is focused on tourism , with more than four miles of shingle beaches			0
it also has a pier built in 1865 which houses an amusement arcade and nightclub			0
temperatures in the town hit an average high of 20.5c in august			0
the town also hosts an annual airshow named @entity85 and a ladies tennis tournament prior to @entity87			0
@entity23 , @entity4 , is a small suburb of @entity88 , located on the southern tip of the @entity90			0
it has a population of around 4,600			0
the town has a regular selection of shops , takeaways , restaurants and pubs to cater for its residents			0
for tourists , the location is a popular wind and kitesurfing location due to its frequently windy weather , while there are are also sheltered swimming beaches			0
those more interested in keeping their feet on dry land can enjoy coastal walks among red northern rata trees			0
there are also three lighthouses at the heads of the coast , which prove popular with tourists visiting the town at weekends			0
they liked the website pictures of what they thought was the @entity47 in @entity23 , @entity24 , but when they keyed in the booking , encouraged by the enticing description of the surroundings , they did n't realise they were looking at a hotel 12,000 miles away on @entity129 's south coast			1
in fact the @entity48 hotel is called the @entity47 , promoting splendid views directly opposite the beach ' within a few minutes ' walk of the bustling pier and picturesque @entity136 , and lying close to the heart of the town			0
' not realising the @entity47 was n't in @entity23 , @entity24 , the couple paid for their accommodation in advance for two nights			1
they were a little puzzled why the payment was in pounds , but went ahead with the booking			0
unable to find @entity147 when they arrived in @entity24 and after driving around in circles the @entity148 went into a chemist 's shop in the @entity23 suburb to ask directions			2
@entity154 said that when they asked where the @entity20 was she told them : ' oh no , there 's no hotel here			0
' when she looked at the booking documents she broke the news : ' that 's in the @entity48 - that 's in @entity129			2
' the scenery in @entity129 : @entity23 's pier and beach in @entity129 , @entity48 miss @entity154 told the paper that she was n't about to let them go without accommodation , so she offered to put them up in her own house for the night			2
she also took them out on the town for beers and dinner at a pub , where the locals gave them some good - natured ribbing			2
with their lost down - payment on the @entity48 hotel , the couple ended up about Â£ 200 out of pocket but they said miss @entity154 's hospitality more than made up for the mix - up			1
the couple have moved to the town of @entity189 for a few nights but will be back in @entity24 next week to stay at the @entity192 - and they 've double - checked that it is in the @entity4 capital and is not some far - away hotel on the @entity129 coast .			1

couple had travelled to watch the @entity14
they *'d* booked into the @entity200 , but could n't find the address on their sat - *nav*
