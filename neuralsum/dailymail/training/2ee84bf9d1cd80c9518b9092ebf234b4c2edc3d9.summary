within seconds he and his wife are surrounded by an aggressive gang of @entity12 sneak thieves , who make no secret of what they want from him			1
feeling hands on his back and arms , the middle age man turns around in horror to see the utterly fearless gang casually trying to help themselves to his money			1
groups of thieves , many of them teenagers , swarm around the main tourist landmarks day and night			1
' they respect nobody â€“ they just want money or anything else they can steal , ' said another tourist who witnessed the incident at the cashpoint between @entity3 and the @entity49 museum , in the 1st arrondissement			1
' it might have been @entity4 , but the gangs were everywhere , ' she said			0
' one minute the man was making a cash withdrawal , the next he was a crime victim			0
' if the police come anywhere near the @entity12 , they just laugh and then run off			1
areas are becoming completely lawless			0
' @entity8 is the most popular tourist destination in the world , and the @entity60 make up the city 's biggest visitor group , but its battle against the @entity12 is a losing one			1
the middle - aged victim turns around in a fright as the thieves swarm around him and his wife the utterly fearless gang casually try to help themselves to the horrified man 's money charity and human rights groups were furious last week when a leaked police memo called for the ' systematic eviction ' of @entity12 from the centre of the city			1
it followed the country 's prime minister , @entity79 , saying that the travelling communities of mainly @entity82 and @entity83 ' can not integrate ' and should be deported			0
a spokesman for charity group @entity85 described the note as a ' scandal ' , saying that it ' stigmatised a poor community ' and amounted to ' racial profiling ' - something which is illegal in secular @entity32			0
getaway : the pickpockets look for their next victim after targeting the tourist using a cash point near @entity3 , @entity8 but other @entity8 officials argued that @entity12 are behind most of the crime in the city , involving themselves in everything from aggressive begging to muggings and burglaries			1
gangs of young @entity12 , including women and children , can regularly be seen harassing tourists			2
in 2011 , @entity32 's then interior minister said that the vast majority of street robberies in @entity8 were being carried out by the children of @entity12 immigrants from @entity82 and @entity83			2
@entity113 said the notoriously poor and corrupt eastern @entity115 states were responsible for exporting some of the most notorious sneak thieves in the world			1
it has led to @entity82 police arriving in @entity8 to support their @entity32 counterparts in clampdowns on the @entity12			1
officers dedicated to guarding tourists around attractions like the @entity49 from the immigrant gangs have increased			0
intimidation , violence and theft increases in the summer months , as more tourists arrive for the groups of @entity12 to prey on			2
' everything possible is being done to make the city a safer one , but many of the @entity12 are young and have no papers , so dealing with them is almost impossible , ' said a local police source			1
many of the @entity12 beggars who congregate around cash points and banks have very young children with them , including babies			2
most of them live in large shanty towns on the outskirts of @entity8 , but more and more are setting up new camps in central parks and squares			0
@entity147 , spokesman for the @entity149 police union , said @entity12 were constantly moving around @entity8			1
' it 's musical chairs ' said mr @entity147			0
' we chase the @entity12 from one place to another , from one arrondissement to the next			2
' even @entity157 , spokesman for @entity32 's @entity158 , appeared to back the police , saying that extremely poor communities living rough in @entity8 made ' everybody extremely nervous '			0
mr @entity157 said : ' we 're obliged to regulate all that , to be clear on all that , not to consider that nothing has happened			0
' prime minister @entity165 has continued a policy started by former president @entity168 of razing @entity12 camps , and trying to deport as many of their occupants as possible			2
this has led to protests from a number of human rights groups , including @entity175 , which points out that most @entity12 in @entity32 are @entity82 or @entity83 and as such are @entity177 citizens with the right to live and work in the country .			0
