it was perhaps asking too much of this season ’s @entity1 to give us another fourth - round shock after a weekend of upsets			0
there were to be no more @entity8 heroics at @entity9 to go with @entity11 ’s humbling of @entity12			0
@entity14 knows @entity15 tried , and at times in the first half @entity16 were certainly rocking			1
but the @entity20 side already had the cushion of a stunning early strike from @entity23 , and they smoothed their passage with second - half goals from substitute @entity26 and @entity27			1

@entity16 ’s inspirational playmaker left the ground on crutches and was driven away long before the game had finished			0
the draw for the fifth round was made before kick - off , handing the winners of this tie a trip to @entity88 where both managers , @entity89 and @entity90 , played earlier in their careers			2
@entity90 also went on to become manager at @entity94 , leading @entity88 to the semi-final in 2007			2
@entity89 requested that news of the draw was not broadcast over the matchday tannoy beforehand to prevent his players from finding out as they prepared for their biggest match of the season			0
considering @entity103 ’s capitulation to @entity104 after a few days in @entity105 , @entity16 fans must have wondered if it was a wise move their team going to @entity108 ahead of the precarious visit to @entity9			0
@entity90 certainly was n’t taking this tie lightly , however			0
having seen his side go behind to @entity113 club @entity112 in the third round , he named a strong line - up with @entity23 a surprise inclusion			2
@entity16 and @entity15 players were involved in a melee in the first half with both teams getting invovled @entity15 's @entity42 grabs hold of @entity23 's jersey after a heated exchange between the pair and the little @entity125 justified the decision as he took the wind out of @entity15 ’s sails after just four minutes			1
@entity130 ’s clearance headed looped towards the edge of the box where @entity23 was waiting , curiously unmarked			0
he never took his eye off the ball for an instant and set him himself before despatching a magnificent left - foot volley into the top corner , giving goalkeeper @entity36 no chance whatsoever			0
if the underdogs were stunned , they did n’t show it			0
they roared back at the @entity20 side with the pace of 14 - goal striker @entity145 causing @entity16 all kinds of problems			2
@entity54 rushed out of his goal to save at the striker ’s feet several times , and on the one occasion that done got there first he rolled the ball agonisingly wide of the post with a clutch of @entity16 defenders trailing in his wake seven minutes before half - time			2
@entity23 receives treatment after falling awkwardly on his knee as he raced through on the @entity15 goal @entity23 had to be replaced by @entity26 and the @entity125 was later seen leaving the ground on crutches done was inches away from connecting with wonderful right - wing cross from @entity37 with only @entity54 to beat , and the @entity16 keeper also came out to deny @entity46 after another pass had split @entity55 and @entity56			1
@entity16 were able to hang on until half - time but by then the inspirational @entity23 was already back in the dressing - room with a yellow card and a sore knee to show for his troubles			1
he was infuriated by a challenge on @entity27 by @entity42 in the 25th minute and let the @entity15 midfielder know how he felt			2
play had continued , however , and @entity23 ploughed into the back of @entity42 right under the nose of @entity72			0
both sets of players became involved in the flare - up and @entity72 booked @entity23 and @entity42 while @entity27 received treatment on his ankle			2
@entity183 breaks through the @entity16 defence as @entity15 create a rare chance done sees his shot saved by @entity54 and @entity15 would go on to rue the missed opportunity the @entity15 fans who had applauded @entity23 ’s strike immediately turned on him and jeered with delight when he went down in the home penalty box moments later			1
there was no apparent challenge on the @entity16 player but @entity90 took no chances , sending on @entity26 while @entity23 was booed all the way as he walked around the perimeter of the pitch and down the tunnel			1
@entity90 also exchanged words with some of the @entity15 fans behind the dugouts during the half as he became increasingly animated over some of the decisions and , one would presume his team ’s performance			2
they only managed three shots on target in the first half compared to @entity15 ’s eight			0
the difference in class was reflected in the finishing , however , and @entity16 scored a second goal seven minutes after the restart			1
@entity26 doubled @entity16 's advantage in the second half to leave them firmly in the driving seat @entity27 squeezed a shot in from near the byline to add gloss to @entity16 's victory at @entity15 there appeared to be no imminent danger when @entity27 took possession on the left - hand side of the box , but he produced a sudden turn of pace to create the space for a cross and guided the ball in low for @entity26 who had timed his run perfectly to score from close - range			1
the former @entity103 midfielder has been something of a lucky mascot for @entity16 in this season ’s competition , having scored his only other two goals in the 3 - 1 win over @entity112			0
@entity27 added a wonderful third as he jinked his way into the box again and this time beat @entity36 himself with a curling effort into the top corner			1
@entity41 got a consolation 12 minutes from time when he capitalised on @entity16 ’s failure to clear the danger and side - footed in from 10 yards but @entity63 restored the visitor 's three - goal lead with seconds remaining			1
but no shame at all for the underdogs either			0
@entity41 fired home in the final minutes to score a consolation for @entity8 @entity15 @entity63 restored @entity16 's three - goal advantage on the stroke of full time			1

@entity23 scored a stunning volley in the opening minutes to put @entity16 in front
but the @entity125 was forced off injured after falling awkwardly on his knee
@entity26 scored a second goal after the break to kill off @entity15
and @entity27 added gloss to the *scoreline* with a *superb* finish
@entity41 scored a late consolation for the @entity8 side
@entity63 completed the scoring for @entity16 in the dying seconds
@entity90 ' side now face his former club @entity88
