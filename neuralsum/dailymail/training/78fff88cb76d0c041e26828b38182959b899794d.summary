by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 's coaches are confident that @entity4 can thrive on a return to the starting xv at @entity7 on saturday , as they brace themselves to rule out @entity8			1
the @entity10 scrum half was officially named in the tourists ’ line - up on wednesday night for the first test against the @entity14 , but it appears increasingly likely that he will be forced to withdraw from the match			2
care will have a fitness test on thursday morning and if , as expected , a shoulder injury prevents him from taking part in the series opener , @entity4 will be promoted from the bench			1
stepping in : @entity4 ( right ) will take @entity8 's place in the @entity3 starting xv on the ball : @entity4 looks for a pass as @entity3 trained at the @entity25 near @entity26 on thursday faith : @entity3 coach @entity28 believes @entity4 is returning to his top form in time for the daunting @entity14 tour it has not been a vintage season for the @entity33 9 , but @entity28 claimed that he is returning to peak performance levels in time for this daunting clash with the world champions			1
‘ it would be a big blow losing @entity8 , but that would be lessened by @entity4 whose form picked up at the end of the season , ’ said @entity3 ’s head coach			1
‘ if you go back to the game in 2012 when he started against @entity14 , that was him at his best and he 's approaching that form now			2
’ @entity28 strongly hinted that @entity8 will be removed from the side for this weekend ’s encounter , in order to be back at full throttle for the second and third @entity52 , adding : ‘ @entity8 is 50 - 50 i 'd say at the moment			1
we want to make sure we 're doing right by him			0
' to go into a test against the @entity14 with anyone who is not 100 per cent physically and mentally would be a poor decision , so we need to make sure he 's 100 per cent right			2
clinging on : @entity58 keeps the ball in his possession as two teammates try to haul him down during training hair - raising : @entity64 looks for teammates as @entity3 prepare for a stern examination against the @entity14 in @entity26 on saturday options : @entity68 scans the positions of his teammates as he runs forward with the ball test of strength : @entity74 pushes weights along the pitch as his teammates watch on resistance movement : @entity78 runs while dragging weights behind him as @entity3 keep up their strength ahead of the first test on the charge : @entity82 takes his turn at dragging along weights on the training field stand - in : @entity4 ( centre ) , seen here with @entity88 ( left ) and @entity89 , will be promoted to the side if @entity8 fails a fitness test on thursday ‘ i also have my mind on the fact there 's more than one game in this series , so i want to make sure i 'm doing right by him			1
i know he 's desperate to play because he 's been exceptional in the @entity100 and for us this season			2
we have to do the right thing			0
’ yet another enforced reshuffle by @entity3 would include a bench role for @entity106 , even though the @entity108 scrum half was among the players involved in last saturday ’s @entity110 , and thus – theoretically – out of contention to play here			1
but @entity113 has no misgivings about asking the experienced @entity115 to be ready for an international appearance so soon after a long - haul flight			0
on the run : @entity3 warm - up with some sprints prior to their training session at the @entity122 safe hands : @entity124 collects the ball during a passing drill ahead of saturday 's @entity7 showdown pass it on : @entity124 is watched closely by his teammates as the ball is moved from left to right alive and kicking : @entity124 practises his kicking in readiness for the first test long haul : @entity108 's @entity106 , seen here with the @entity100 trophy after the win over @entity137 at @entity138 last weekend , has joined the @entity3 party out in @entity14 ‘ @entity106 's excited , ’ he said			1
‘ he 's just played in a final , he 's won it and is absolutely buzzing			0
he did n't train today and we need to manage him carefully			0
' as soon as we knew about @entity8 we got word back to him in @entity3			0
he started adjusting his time and sleep patterns from @entity3 to make sure he 's adjusted			0
he 'll be ready , no problem			0

care likely to be withdrawn from first test at @entity7 with shoulder injury
@entity4 will be promoted from the bench for series opener
