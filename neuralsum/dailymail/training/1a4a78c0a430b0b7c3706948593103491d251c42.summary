he was accused by a fellow @entity1 this week of having a ‘ weakness for women ’			1
now @entity4 has been criticised by another for using public money to employ both his wife and his ‘ former mistress ’			1
the @entity1 leader was alleged to have had an affair with his spin doctor @entity11 , 32 , who recently tried to explain the distinction between a ‘ slag ’ and a ‘ slut ’ following a row at the party conference			1
but independent mep @entity23 asked in the @entity36 : ‘ with unemployment still a problem across @entity39 and indeed across the @entity40 , does mr @entity4 think it is a fair use of taxpayers ’ money , namely his secretarial allowance , not only to employ his wife @entity35 but his former mistress @entity11 ? ’ mr @entity4 replied : ‘ i do n’t want to answer that at all , thank you			1
’ mr @entity4 's wife @entity35 wants a chat with her husband over the allegations the extraordinary allegation comes just days after @entity1 mep @entity48 said : ‘ we all have our foibles and our weaknesses – mine is real ale , i ’ve never been partial to crumpet			1
' @entity4 ’s is women			1
it ’s not something he ever denied			0
’ the @entity1 leader and miss @entity11 fiercely denied the claims of an affair , but mrs @entity4 seemed less certain when asked at the large semi-detached family home near @entity62 , @entity63			1
she said : ‘ @entity4 ’s just on his way back from @entity65 and we will be discussing it tonight , i ’m sure			2
i do n’t want to comment today			0
’ rumours about miss @entity11 ’s close friendship with mr @entity4 have swirled since she was appointed by the party in 2006 , soon after graduating from the @entity71			1
she broke down in tears in 2008 after revealing she had received ‘ threatening ’ telephone calls accusing of her of being a ‘ whore ’ , in what she claimed was part of a vicious two - year smear campaign aimed at undermining mr @entity4			1
mr @entity4 said he had faced questions about his relationship with miss @entity11 since 2006 but insisted ' it is not true ' the former public schoolgirl left @entity1 because of the claims but remained a well - known socialite around @entity84			1
three years ago , she accused @entity86 mp @entity85 of groping her on the balcony of his flat close to the @entity89			0
he was arrested but the case was later dropped and mr @entity85 has always strongly denied all the allegations			0
miss @entity11 later waived her right to anonymity and said her life had been ‘ destroyed ’ by the incident and that she had been branded a ‘ fantasist			2
’ after leaving @entity1 , she started a public relations firm , @entity97 , which boasts a recommendation from mr @entity4 on its website praising her ability to ‘ resolve issues which may arise			1
’ she repaid the compliment by lavishing praise on mr @entity4 on the company ’s facebook page for his ability to use social media to engage with new audiences			1
miss @entity11 resumed working for mr @entity4 last year and soon afterwards they were spotted going for a curry together close to her flat in @entity112 , @entity113			2
she was thrown into the spotlight when mr @entity48 was surrounded by journalists after calling a room of women at the party ’s conference ‘ sluts ’			2
miss @entity11 tried to defend the comment to reporters , saying : ‘ i think people do n’t understand the difference between “ slut ” and “ slag ”			0

’ her company website also offers advice on ‘ what to do if a journalist calls ’			0
when the @entity157 contacted her for comment by phone yesterday , she hung up			0
she later issued a statement through the @entity1 press office strongly criticising @entity162 , who was born a man before undergoing sex - change surgery in her 20s			2
miss @entity11 said : ‘ it ’s a shame that as a woman i am considered fair game for accusations of alleged affairs			0
it ’s hard enough being a woman in politics without having to justify why i am employed			0
‘ it is safe to say that this would not have happened if i was a man			0
surely this is something that @entity23 should have considered			2
’ miss @entity11 ’s mother , @entity179 , refused to come to the door of her semi-detached home in @entity182 - on - @entity183 yesterday			0
but her uncle @entity184 , who also lives in the commuter town , branded the allegations ‘ ridiculous ’			0
he added : ‘ what difference would it make if they had had an affair ? ’ mr @entity4 told the @entity157 : ‘ every single national newspaper has asked me that question since 2006 and the answer remains the same			1
