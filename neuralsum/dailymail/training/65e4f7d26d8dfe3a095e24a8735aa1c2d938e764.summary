on tuesday , mr @entity2 said what his government does at sea is in line with its international obligations and safety protocols			1
he also took a swipe at @entity19 and @entity21 ' activists ' , accusing them of trying to disrupt the government 's policies			1
the prime minister added : ' what i 'm focused on is stopping the boats			0
that is what we are absolutely and constantly focused on , because as long as the boats keeping coming , we will keep having deaths at sea			2
' so the most decent , humane and compassionate thing you can do is to stop the boats			0
' the @entity48 has criticised @entity4 's decision to return 41 asylum seekers to @entity11 , as the @entity6 considers the future of 153 others who could face the same fate			1
but mr @entity2 dodged questions about the asylum seeker group and the court 's decision			1
' i 'm just not going to comment at all on operational matters , ' he told the @entity31			0
' any commentary by government members about operational matters just gives aid and comfort to the people smugglers			0
' this comes as the father of a three - year - old girl named @entity70 , who is among 37 children in the group of 153 , has appealed for the government to protect his daughter			1
it is claimed that @entity70 was travelling on a vessel which left the @entity78 city of @entity79 on june 13			0
there has been no word from the boat since june 28			0
@entity11 girl @entity70 , 3 , is claimed to be a passenger on the missing boat of asylum seekers speaking to the @entity88 , the unidentified man appealed directly to immigration minister @entity89 for information ' i am desperate to know where my family is			1
i ca nâ€™t function at all not knowing			0
i know all of them would be in very big trouble if sent back to @entity11 , ' he said			2
' i want to plead with the @entity4 minister to stop our pain and let us know what he has done with all the kids and families on the boat			1
i ask him to be kind to these people			0
they are all very frightened			0
' they can not be sent back to @entity11			2
many of them will be tortured again and even killed			0
' the man wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals			0
' i can not understand why a country like @entity4 would send people back to @entity11 , knowing they have been tortured there			1
why would they do it ? ' he said			0
an image believed to be his daughter has appeared on the @entity121 website			0
it was impossible to verify if the girl in the picture was on the refugee ship			0
a late sitting of the @entity6 in @entity127 on monday barred the return of the 153 asylum seekers , 48 of whom are @entity130 , until 4pm tuesday or further order of the court			1
their case will be heard at the @entity6 in @entity135 at 2pm today			2

but he said he was not going to comment on ' operational matters '			0
' any commentary by government members about operational matters just gives aid and comfort to the people smugglers , ' he said			0
the @entity48 high commissioner for refugees also criticised @entity4 's decision to return the 41 asylum seekers to @entity11 , saying it doubted the government 's brief interviews on board the boat to assess refugee claims complied with international law			1
the agency said its experience with shipboard processing has generally not been positive			0
' such an environment would rarely afford an appropriate venue for a fair procedure , ' it said in a statement			0
amid reports that 41 tamils from another boat of asylum seekers were facing criminal charges following their handover to @entity11 police , lawyer @entity32 says the 153 asylum seekers are ' entitled to have their claims for protection processed in accordance with @entity4 law '			1
' the [ immigration ] minister can not simply intercept their vessel in the middle of the night and " disappear ' them , " ' mr @entity32 told @entity0 on monday night			0
' the asylum seekers claim that they are fleeing persecution and that they 're at risk of death , torture or significant harm at the hands of @entity11 authorities , ' mr @entity32 said			1
' [ there 's ] a need for ongoing protection			0
' forty - one @entity11 asylum seekers from a second boat already returned by the @entity4 authorities reportedly face jail despite assurances from the @entity2 government they were in no danger of persecution			1
but mr @entity32 argues there are serious concerns for the safety of the asylum seekers if they are handed over , and is worried they will also be charged and potentially jailed			1
' in @entity11 jails , detainees are often subjected to torture and sometimes they never reappear , ' he said			2
' we 're talking about a boat load of women and children , and i would have thought that the minister needs to think very clearly before he sends them into @entity11 jail			1
' the group already handed over will face court in the port of @entity232 at an unspecified date , charged under the @entity234 , a @entity11 police spokesman reportedly said			1
a @entity6 injunction is preventing the return of 153 asylum seekers to @entity11 authorities over concerns about their safety and relatives of those reportedly on a missing boat are appealing for information the asylum seekers were transferred in mild sea conditions off the coast of @entity11 after the boat was stopped west of the @entity249 in late june			1
' the sentence for those who are proved to have left illegally is two years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine , ' the spokesman said , according to @entity255			0
the @entity4 government says none of the @entity176 , who were screened via video link , are in danger of persecution			2
' all were screened in terms of any potential protection obligation and none were found to be owed that protection , ' immigration minister @entity89 said on monday			0
refugee lawyer @entity265 said it was difficult to track the fate of returned asylum seekers			1
' this is part of the problem that we 've seen in @entity11 , with people being essentially summarily expelled there without proper due process , ' he told @entity274			2
opposition frontbencher @entity275 says @entity30 has ' serious concerns ' about the treatment of the asylum @entity21 senator @entity279 says the government seems to believe it is ' above the law '			2
' the @entity4 people are becoming sick and tired of the spin , the secrecy , and the danger we 're putting these people 's lives in			2
' the court 's injunction ends at 4pm on tuesday unless it makes an order to extend it .			2
