the @entity9 is accused of allowing multinational firms to pay virtually no tax on massive profits – draining resources from countries forced to make drastic cuts to reduce their deficits			1
the scandal has dragged in mr @entity19 ’s former prime minister			1
the new president of the @entity21 , @entity6 ' most powerful official , is under mounting pressure to explain the complicated tax deals struck while he was leader			2
protesters campaign against @entity21 president @entity5 in @entity6 yesterday among the new companies exposed in secret tax documents leaked to the @entity29 are @entity0 , @entity31 firm @entity30 and @entity32 – now owned by @entity2			1
there is no suggestion that the tax schemes are illegal			1
the documents were obtained by the @entity37			2
dozens of multinationals implicated in the latest leaks engineered complicated tax schemes which helped cut their tax bills			1
the new revelations will step up the pressure on mr @entity5 who praised @entity4 ’s tax policies			1
in 2005 , when mr @entity5 was both prime minister and finance minister of @entity4 , he said : ‘ @entity32 will remain based here … this is partly because of the favourable fiscal environment we ’ve created here in @entity4			1
’ since being appointed to the top job in @entity6 mr @entity5 has brushed off allegations that @entity4 , under his leadership , engaged in ‘ industrial scale tax avoidance ’			1
he said : ‘ i am not the architect of the @entity4 model because this model does n’t exist			2
’ but according to the @entity29 about 340 companies – including @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 – secured special tax deals with @entity4			1
last week , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 demanded a clampdown on @entity4 - based tax avoidance			2
they said : ‘ our citizens and our companies expect us to cope with tax avoidance and aggressive planning			2
’ @entity4 is accused of allowing multinational firms like @entity0 to pay virtually no tax on massive profits – draining resources from countries forced to make drastic cuts to reduce their deficits @entity84 ’s spending watchdog chief @entity82 said the revelations raised serious questions over mr @entity5 ’s suitability to head up the @entity21			1
she said : ‘ since i have uncovered all this i have questions about if mr @entity5 is fit to be the president of the @entity21			1
‘ i think if this had been around during the period of his appointment it might well be a different decision			0
’ the companies named in the leaked documents said they had done nothing wrong			1
@entity96 said : ‘ like all @entity96 companies , @entity97 conducts its business lawfully , and pays its taxes in accordance with applicable laws			0
as the @entity29 has previously acknowledged , all of our activities in these matters are legal			0
’ @entity2 , @entity32 ’s parent , said : ‘ @entity2 ’s acquisition of @entity32 was finalised in october 2011 , so we can only speak to activities after that date			0
’ @entity111 mp @entity82 said the revelations raised serious questions over mr @entity5 ’s suitability as @entity21 president the statement added that @entity2 had since changed @entity32 ’s business model : ‘ as a global business , @entity2 adheres carefully to the laws and regulations of every country in which we operate			1
’ it comes after @entity123 ’s ambassador to the @entity124 defended @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 amid claims they were no playing by the rules on tax			2
@entity132 leapt to the defence of the giant corporations which have come under fire for their tax policies , saying they were simply following international tax rules laid down by governments			0
@entity140 warned in october that multinationals which exploit loopholes to avoid paying @entity124 taxes would be made to ‘ damn well pay ’			0
the @entity144 will today publish details of a new ‘ @entity125 tax ’ designed to ensure that multinationals operating in the @entity124 pay at least some tax here			2
but mr @entity132 told journalists in @entity150 it was wrong to describe the firms as ‘ international tax dodgers ’ despite the fact they pay little , if any , corporation tax in this country			1
‘ i ’m not the spokesman for any of those great @entity1 companies , ’ he said			0
‘ these companies and other companies … are clever about using international rules that exist , as written , by the way , by all of us – that ’s @entity1 government , @entity124 government – we make these rules and they are playing by them			0
‘ and i hope that if and when rules change they will play by those new rules as well			0
’ @entity126 is reported to have paid no corporation tax in the @entity124 for the last two years			0
@entity125 , which generated more than £ 3.5billion from the @entity124 last year , paid just over £ 20million in corporation tax			0
and @entity127 , which sold goods worth £ 4.3billion in the @entity124 last year , paid just £ 4.2million			0
the firms all insist that they are operating within the international tax rules			2
but their behaviour has sparked mounting anger in the @entity124			0
chancellor @entity177 announced last week that the @entity124 will impose a new ‘ diverted profits tax ’ on corporations that seek to artificially shift their profits to low tax regimes abroad			0
he said it would raise £ 1billion over five years			0
but experts warn that the so - called ‘ @entity125 tax ’ , whose details will be unveiled today , could prove fiendishly difficult to enforce .			0
