if anyone doubted the need for @entity4 boss @entity3 to splash out £ 25 million on @entity5 , he would be happy to show them the opening 45 minutes at @entity8 as exhibit a. @entity3 was in tetchy mood despite watching his side stretch their unbeaten run to 14 games , and it had nothing to do with midfielder @entity17 and his ‘ loan ’ saga			1
@entity4 dominated @entity20 , particularly in the first half , and yet register just two efforts on target			1
when the home side were vulnerable , @entity24 and @entity25 missed the target horribly after being set up by @entity28			0
and they were not the only culprits			0
but if @entity5 had played instead of @entity24 , @entity4 would surely have gained an important win to stay level on points with @entity42 at the top , rather than fall two points behind			1
@entity105 want a lot of money for their @entity109 striker but @entity3 would like his bosses to pay up			0
‘ we had big chances to score in the first half , but if you do n’t score you do n’t win , ’ said the stony - faced @entity4 boss			1
‘ it ’s our own fault			0
we pressed well , we created chances , but we finished in the wrong way			0
‘ every team will drop points from now until the end of the season			2
we never thought this was an easy game and it is always difficult at @entity20			2
maybe it was a good draw but i can not forget about the first half , we had too many clear opportunities			2
’ @entity4 ’s lack of accuracy did not seem to matter when @entity44 headed in from close range after @entity28 ’s shot had been parried by keeper @entity51			1
but @entity20 , belying a side that had lost their last four league games , deservedly levelled when @entity33 got in ahead of @entity4 skipper @entity34 to head in a @entity37 free - kick			1
it was a 45th @entity134 assist for @entity37 , a new record for a defender , and confirmed @entity33 ’s reputation as a scorer against the top teams			1
he has now netted against @entity140 , @entity42 , @entity141 and @entity4			1
@entity142 playmaker @entity28 run at the @entity20 defense during the @entity134 game on saturday afternoon @entity43 returned after a lay - off with a knee injury on saturday as he replaced @entity24 in the second half @entity56 skips pat the challenge from @entity4 midfielder @entity44 at @entity8 @entity149 goes down injured holding his leg but @entity55 protests his innocence to the referee the rain swept down on @entity8 during a dark january day on @entity154 ‘ it was an old - fashioned game , ’ said @entity20 boss @entity70 , after a match played in high winds and heavy rain			1
‘ we allowed @entity4 too much space in the first half but showed a lot of character and grit after we went behind			1
’ by the end , nobody could have knocked @entity20 for gaining a point			1
the better chances fell to them , mainly because @entity59 made £ 32 m defender @entity72 look like a park player			0
@entity59 sprinted past @entity72 in the first - half and forced a wonderful one - handed save from @entity34 , and @entity72 later climbed all over @entity53 as they contested a corner			0
‘ i ’ve seen them given , ’ said @entity70			0
despite @entity4 ’s recent form , the club had suffered a torrid week after having to admit they had misled people over the terms of @entity17 ’s spell at the club			2
it seems the former @entity183 midfielder had signed a 12 - month contract with @entity4 even though it was believed he was on loan from @entity187 ’s other club in the @entity188 , @entity189			2
here , though , it was @entity28 who set up the chances , only for his team - mates to miss. @entity24 , most vulnerable to @entity5 ’s arrival , fired high over @entity51 ’ goal after an incisive pass from his @entity142 team - mate put him through			0
@entity25 did not do much better , scuffing an untidy finish wide from eight yards			0
@entity53 then had to stretch to block a @entity28 shot and after @entity24 had done the difficult work by dribbling past @entity54 , he failed to convert the finish			0
@entity76 then took a heavy touch when put through by @entity28 , and even @entity28 did the same when set up by @entity25			0
@entity202 had a good chance to put @entity4 in front in the first half as he looked to shine in @entity43 's absence @entity59 was denied by a @entity34 's legs when he raced through down the right in the first half three city players ( @entity44 , @entity25 and @entity71 ) attempt to track down @entity56 @entity20 were all at sea , with @entity57 given catcalls from home fans , but whenever @entity59 got one - on - one with @entity72 , @entity20 posed a real threat			1
the @entity214 was denied at the near post by @entity34 , with @entity52 hitting the bar on the rebound			0
yet @entity43 ’s introduction — unsurprisingly replacing @entity24 — seemed to inspire @entity20			1
they had a goal disallowed when @entity53 tapped in after an offside @entity33 had challenged @entity34			2
but @entity4 then scored in a move started with some brilliant defensive work from @entity71			2
@entity4 burst up the right - hand side and when @entity76 switched the ball inside to @entity28 , the @entity223 had a shot that looped up from @entity51 into the path of @entity44 who headed in the 74th minute			1
yet @entity20 showed tremendous character and bounced back to level just four minutes later			2
once again , it was the left foot of @entity37 that created the danger			0
he curled in a free - kick following a foul by @entity71 and @entity33 timed his run to perfection to get in front of the @entity4 defence and ahead of @entity34 to head in before the @entity183 goalkeeper could punch the ball away			1
@entity3 sent on @entity17 for the final eight minutes and he got some pantomime boos from an increasingly involved @entity8 crowd			0
this time , though , there was no fairy - tale ending for him , or @entity4			0
@entity25 and @entity55 compete for the ball as @entity4 tried to keep the pressure on @entity134 leaders @entity42 @entity59 reacts after coming just losing out to @entity34 when looking to get on the end of a ball forward @entity20 fans react on the touchline as @entity3 tries to spur on full back @entity74 an @entity20 banner at @entity8 was partially blown down due to strong winds prior to kick - off @entity33 helps up @entity28 after fouling the @entity223 in the second half @entity76 fires a free - kick towards goal but his effort was blocked by the @entity20 wall @entity20 goalkeeper @entity51 roars with delight after @entity33 heads home an equaliser @entity37 throws his body in the way as @entity265 shoots towards goal at @entity8 @entity266 and @entity59 look to show their strength as they tussle for the ball @entity20 bss @entity70 ( left ) and @entity4 's @entity3 shake hands before kick - off @entity43 warms up ahead of the game at @entity8 as the @entity274 returned after a knee injury @entity76 skips over goalkeeper @entity51 after over-running the ball in the @entity20 area @entity59 was a handful for both @entity4 defenders , here tussling with @entity274 @entity73			1

@entity4 held to second draw in three games to fall two points behind @entity134 leaders @entity42
@entity20 end run of four *consecutive* league defeats after @entity33 header in 78th minute
@entity44 had scored the opener four minutes before @entity33 's goal with flicked header
@entity43 comes on as a sub in second half as @entity274 returns after a knee injury
