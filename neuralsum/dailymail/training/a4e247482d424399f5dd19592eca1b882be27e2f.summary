when i was asked to try the new product from @entity2 - i knew i would be instantly transported back down nostalgia lane to my childhood			2
@entity5 was offered an exclusive taste test of the soft drink giant 's new beverage for the slightly more health conscious consumers out there known as ' balance - seekers '			1
a can of @entity14 boasts 35 per cent less sugar thanks to the introduction of the natural sweetener @entity18 - meaning it only contains 290 calories compared to the classic can 's 450 calories			1
the gleaming green can almost looks like an impersonator next to the traditional colours of the red , white , black and silver branding across the three others kinds of @entity14			1
@entity2 group marketing manager @entity34 said the colour was chosen to stand out above its carbonated competitors			0
' it 's really about making sure we stand out on shelf with something that ’s vibrant so that we are clearly positioning ourself as yet another vibrant addition to the @entity52 - and it also compliments the rest of the family , ' she said			0
trying the new @entity14 was a serious blast from the past for me as it was designed to taste like the classic product which i have n't had for probably for the best part of three decades			1
never having been much of a soft drink fan , i compared the can of life to the zero product which is marketed towards men who are n't enticed by diet version			2
as subtle as it may be - i felt that @entity14 tasted more like the real deal than zero - which has no sugar but contains the controversial artificial sweetener @entity71 - as does @entity72			2
@entity73 marketing manager @entity34 says the soft drink giant was under no illusion that its products were considered as part of a health range just before tasting @entity14 , i wrote a story on buses needing to increase the load limit by two tonnes to cater for the fact that @entity84 's waistlines have expanded almost 20 per cent between 1989 and 2012			1
@entity85 from @entity86 mentioned to @entity5 that although the statistics were not surprising - she hoped that a downward trend of junk food consumption in @entity90 would be picked up @entity91			2
' there are little glimmers of hope around such as in the @entity90 where the consumption of @entity96 's and @entity2 has been decreasing and their sales are dropping , ' she said			0
' perhaps it will be a bit of a trend that might reflect back eventually on weight loss but it takes time to see those changes			0
' ms @entity34 expressed that the multi-million dollar international company had never marketed its products as a healthy range			0
' we do n’t attempt to market @entity2 or any of our products - and certainly not even our latest in the line with @entity14 - as a health drink , ’ she said			0
‘ we are under no illusions we are operating in that space			0
' ' we are a fun great tasting drink that people consume on occasions that are relevant to them			0
' @entity14 uses a mix of sugar and natural plant @entity18 , which has been in @entity118 as a sweetener for over 30 years ' we truly believe obesity is a very complex issue and the causes of which are multi-factorial and our responsibility in this current environment is we want to continue to provide range and choice , ' ms @entity34 said			1
' consumers ultimately decide the kind of portions , sizes and flavours that they are seeking which is all part of what we think we need to do to have that responsible social footprint			0
' set to be launched in @entity136 and @entity84 in april next year , @entity14 has already been launched in @entity90 , the @entity137 and @entity138 - where the product actually has an astounding 60 per cent less sugar to cater to that particular @entity142 market			1
whether the die - hard @entity84 @entity14 fans will embrace the new @entity14 remains to be green ...			1

@entity146 is being launched in @entity84 in april next year
the gleaming green can has 35 per cent less sugar than classic coke
natural sweetener , @entity18 , is used to *replace* the sugar
