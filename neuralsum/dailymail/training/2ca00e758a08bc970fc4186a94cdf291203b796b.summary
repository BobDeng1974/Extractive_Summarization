the first - half performance against @entity1 on saturday does not mean @entity2 should ditch their diamond formation — they just need to use it better			1
@entity6 ’s side struggled in the opening 45 minutes , which led some to suggest that the solution is a return to using wingers			2
but i think to get a diamond system to prosper , you need to get your best players on the ball in between the lines , in the most dangerous parts of the pitch			1
@entity18 struggled to get into the game during the first half of @entity2 's 3 - 1 win against @entity1 @entity18 's touch map proves he was unable to get on the ball in key areas against @entity1 that ’s where @entity2 failed			1
look at the touch map of @entity18 ’s night : he barely touched the ball in the danger zone just outside the @entity31 penalty area			0
@entity2 need to get him on the ball more			0
this system is all about having an extra man in the middle of the park and @entity2 need to use whoever is best for that			2
they also need to play with a lot more purpose and pace from the off			0
they only did that once they had conceded			0
i ca n’t remember many @entity2 debuts as good as @entity48 ’s			1
he deserves to keep the shirt			0
@entity51 did well but needs to go forward with the same conviction			0
@entity53 right back @entity48 impressed on his senior @entity2 debut against @entity1 video we 're happy for @entity57			1

@entity2 boss @entity6 may *decide* to ditch diamond system
@entity6 *decide*d to *abandon* diamond formation during second half of 3 - 1 win against @entity1
@entity66 's @entity65 was impressed with @entity48 's *display*
