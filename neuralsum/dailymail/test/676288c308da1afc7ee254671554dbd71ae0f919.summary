it was a vision that apparently led the biblical @entity1 to become one of the most influential figures in early @entity4 by helping to spread the religion around the world			1
but now astronomers believe the bright light in the sky that triggered the conversion of @entity1 may have actually been a falling meteor 2,000 years ago			1
they say descriptions of @entity1 's experience - in which he was blinded for three days after seeing a bright light - match accounts of the fireball that streaked across the sky above @entity18 in @entity19 in 2013			1
writing in the journal @entity37 , he said : ' the first - century book , @entity39 , gives three separate descriptions of a bright light " from heaven " , which occurred probably in the 30s ( @entity43 ) near @entity24 , @entity25			2
a meteor that blazed across southern @entity45 in february was the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century			0
more than 1,600 people were injured by the shock wave from the explosion , estimated to be as strong as 20 @entity51 atomic bombs , as it landed near the city of @entity18			0
the fireball measuring 18 meters across , screamed into @entity55 's atmosphere at 41,600 mph			0
much of the meteor landed in a local lake called @entity58			0
scientists have already uncovered more than 12 pieces from @entity61 since the february 15 incident			0
however , only five of them turned out being real meteorites			0
the @entity18 asteroid caused the second most powerful explosion in recorded history			2
the first was in 1908 when a suspected asteroid exploded with a force about 1,000 times more powerful than @entity51 , levelling about 80m trees over 772 sq miles ( 2,000 sq km ) near @entity19 's @entity73 in @entity74			0
it is thought the @entity18 meteor may have formed after breaking off a 656 feet wide asteroid called 2011 @entity78			2
researchers have also found that it may have collided with another asteroid around 290 million years ago			2
' the details offer a strikingly good match to a @entity18 - class or @entity85 - class fireball			0
' in the accounts given in the @entity35 , @entity1 had been one of the zealous persecutors of the followers of @entity89			0
however , during a journey to @entity24 , @entity25 , he and his companions saw a bright light in the sky			2
@entity1 was blinded for three days and he heard a divine voice or sound			1
the experience apparently so affected @entity1 that he converted to @entity4 and undertook several influential missions to spread the word of @entity89 around the @entity99			1
many believe @entity1 's preaching led to the rise of much of the theology and traditions in the @entity106 and @entity107 faith strands that exist today			1
however , some have attempted to explain @entity1 's vision as being the result of some kind of seizure or of sunstroke			1
dr @entity29 , however , says the description of the light in the sky , the thunderous sound and the temporary blindness all match the events of a meteorite			1
he said the @entity123 meteor , which exploded in the atmosphere close to the @entity19 city , is a good example of what @entity1 may have experienced			2
he said that the bright light in the sky - which was ' brighter than the sun , shining round me ' - matches videos of the @entity18 meteor , which was estimated to be three times as bright as the sun. its movement across the sky created fast moving shadows that would have given the impression of the light moving around @entity1			1
the meteorite that streaked across the sky above @entity18 in @entity19 ( above ) created a bright light and noise that may have been similar to those experienced by @entity1 in 30 ad , claims astronomer the shockwave caused by exploding meterorite over @entity18 shattered windows and apparently caused the roof of this zinc factory in the city to collapse			1
100 people were injured by flying glass from the blast dr @entity29 says that the shockwave created by an exploding meteor could also have been responsible for knocking @entity1 and his companions to the ground after the light			1
the shock wave created by the meteor that exploded above @entity18 shattered windows , rocked cars and knocked people over			0
dr @entity29 also argues that the sound of the explosion could also have been the source of the ' voice ' @entity1 heard			2
the three accounts of his experience in the @entity35 differ , with some saying it was a voice and others a sound			0
the fireball that above @entity18 ( above ) was captured by a number of dashboard cameras in cars @entity1 's temporary blindness could also have been caused by the intense ultraviolet radiation from the meteor - creating a condition called photokeratitis			1
dr @entity29 said : ' among the most impressive , unexpected consistencies with modern knowledge is the first - century description of symptoms of temporary blindness caused by exposure to intense radiation , matching a condition now known as photokeratitis			1
' in @entity18 the radiation given off by the meteor was strong enough to cause sunburn and some temporary blindness			1
speaking to @entity195 , dr @entity29 said : ' everything they are describing in those three accounts in the book of acts are exactly the sequence you see with a fireball			0
' if that first - century document had been anything other than part of the @entity35 , that would have been a straightforward story			0
' the 20 - ft - wide hole in the ice of a frozen lake was created by the falling fragments of the @entity18 meteor he added that unfamiliar natural phenomena like an exploding meteor are often interpreted in the context of ' current cultural conceptions '			1
he added however that he does not intend to discredit @entity4 with his interpretation , but hopes to show how a meteor may have changed the course of the religion			0
other researchers said that a search for meteorites in and around @entity25 could help to prove his theories			0
even if his theory does prove to be correct , others say that it is unlikely that @entity4 would not have spread if @entity1 had not encountered the meteor			1
however , @entity231 , a religious historian at the @entity232 , said that the religion could have been very different			0
he told @entity195 : ' people 's interpretation of @entity1 is absolutely fundamental to some of the central figures of @entity4			2
' @entity4 probably would be very different without him			0

astronomer claims bright light and divine voice heard by @entity1 2,000 years ago may have been exploding meteor similar to the one over @entity18
uv radiation could have caused temporary blindness called photokeratitis
scientist claims this may have been the source of @entity1 's ' vision ' in @entity251
@entity1 was an *instrumental* figure in the spread of @entity4
