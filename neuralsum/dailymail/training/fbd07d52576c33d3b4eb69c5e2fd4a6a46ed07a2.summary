by @entity1 reporter published : 15:07 est , 18 november 2012 updated : 05:37 est , 19 november 2012 the majority of slang used in @entity5 today originates in cities with large @entity8 populations , it has been suggested			1
a study of language used on @entity11 found that popular terms begin in specific urban areas are the ones that then spread more widely			1
it confirms the long - held view that african - american slang - with words such as cool and dig - has a strong influence on the rest of the population			2
a study of around 40million tweets provides valuable insight into the use of local slang terms across the @entity5 , explaining how terms such as ' bruh ' and the emoticon ' - _ - ' can spread from region to region over time			1
enlightening : this map shows the areas where @entity8 slang terms tend to originate , and the paths they take across the country as they grow in popularity @entity38 at the @entity39 in @entity40 and his colleagues examined millions of tweets sent from locations in the @entity5 between december 2009 and may 2011 to find out where commonly used slang words were originating and how they were migrating to other parts of the country			1
they found that certain regions , such as @entity40 , @entity49 and @entity50 , are hotbeds for new slang terms , and that those cities often share and exchange slang words			0
' @entity55 , ' for example , originated in the @entity56 and eventually jumped to @entity49			0
tracking slang : researcher @entity38 examined millions of tweets for the linguistic study the emoticon ' - _ - ' , implying indifference or mild annoyance , began in @entity50 and @entity63 before leaping to @entity64 and @entity65			2
and more often than not , @entity50 tend to type ' nuttin ' in place of ' nothing			0
' residents of @entity70 , @entity71 , were the first to use " ctfu " , an abbreviation of " cracking the fuck up " , usage that has since spread into @entity76 , the @entity75 reported			2
they collected around 40million messages from around 400,000 individuals between june 2009 and may 2011 that could be tied to a particular geographical location in the @entity5 because of the smartphone metadata optionally included with the message			0
after collecting the data , the team built a mathematical model that captures the large - scale flow of new words between @entity90 model revealed that cities with big @entity8 populations tend to lead the way in linguistic innovation			2
@entity38 and his colleagues are tracing the origins and spread of colloquialisms to understand better understand how @entity11 is affecting written language			1
as part of their research , they have produced a map illustrating the migration of language trends and how different regions affect one another			0
they are also trying to determine how and why certain words catch on and become trendy whereas others never leave the cities of their origin			0
the researchers are hoping to present their preliminary findings at a workshop on @entity117 and @entity118 in december organised by the @entity119			0
however , one expert suggested that the results do n't necessarily reflect the wider population as @entity11 has a higher rate of adoption among @entity8 than other ethnic groups .			1

researchers use @entity11 as a tool to study spread of language
it reveals the influence of @entity8 *culture*
