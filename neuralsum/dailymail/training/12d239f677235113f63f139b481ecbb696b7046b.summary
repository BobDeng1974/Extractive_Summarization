the world 's oldest living @entity1 penguin has undergone $ 4500 worth of radiation treatment at @entity5 's @entity4 in a bid to extend its life			1
@entity8 , who is 40 years old , was given a concentrated dose of radiotherapy last month to treat the skin cancer in the middle of her beak and right eye			2
with @entity8 now back home at @entity17 , zoo staff can keep their fingers crossed that she will reach 42 years old and become the world 's oldest ever @entity1 penguin			1
@entity1 penguins will likely be completely obsolete in the wild over the next twenty years , @entity5 said in a release last week			2
if @entity8 's caretakers can raise awareness for the plight of the species through her , her treatment and hopefully the record , then it will be worth it			2
' if we can make people aware of these endangered species , with awareness comes action , and with action comes change			0
and , ultimately , we help , ' @entity48 also said			0
@entity8 's wounds were first spotted following a skirmish at @entity17 , which passed along tissue samples from an extracted mass to @entity5 , the university said			1
@entity17 veterinarian dr. @entity64 said of @entity8 - an indoor penguin - in the release ' if you did n’t know her , you would never guess she ’s as old as she is			1
that ’s why we wanted to pursue further treatment for her tumor			0
' ' we would love to see @entity8 make it to be the oldest penguin on record , which would be 42 , ' @entity64 also said in a @entity5 video			1
' but she 's a special bird and we 'd like to keep her around as long as possible , so even if we do n't get a cure , at least we 're buying her some good quality of life and a little bit longer life			0
' @entity5 said that @entity8 's mass showed up again and proved malignant			2
during her stay at the veterinary hospital , the elderly bird underwent a @entity85 , which found that her face had a tumor ' about the size of a pinto bean			0
' concentrated radiation known as electronic brachytherapy was performed on @entity8 for just under 22 minutes as a non-invasive procedure , @entity5 said			1
homecoming : @entity8 , seen wearing a pink band on her wing , is now back in @entity17 's penguin exhibit and with her mate @entity97 @entity8 slept in the arms of her zookeeper during her trip back to @entity17 that night , and her tumor is now shedding , the university said dr. @entity48 , speaking to @entity103 , said electronic brachytherapy was picked as @entity8 's treatment after her ct scan			1
' @entity108 is a really , really , good therapy for treating small superficial tumors , ' he said , explaining that @entity8 's tumor ' fell into [ that ] treatment range			2
' @entity48 said the area where the tumor was turned red and has started to slough off - but that veterinarians must wait four to six weeks to see if more radiation treatments are necessary			2
@entity17 paid $ 450 out of the $ 4500 total cost for @entity8 's treatment , and @entity5 covered the rest , @entity48 told @entity103			1
he explained , ' we do n't have the opportunity to use this therapy very often , and we wanted to give it a shot			0
' @entity17 executive director @entity125 said in an email exchange with @entity103 that ' for our little zoo , this cutting edge treatment would normally be outside our reach , but the fine team at the vet teaching hospital agreed to do the work at a significantly reduced rate			2
' they saw , as did we , that this was a tremendous opportunity to advance our knowledge of this treatment and it 's impacts on non-traditional species			0
any costs outside of the discounts and in - kind work that the @entity5 folks did , will be paid out of our veterinary operating budget for the year			0
@entity147 said payment is still being worked out between the zoo and the university			0
@entity8 slept in the arms of her zookeeper during her trip back to @entity17 that night , and her tumor is now shedding , the university said			1
@entity8 spent two weeks in isolation before she re-entered @entity17 's penguin exhibit and got back into her nest with 33 - year - old @entity97 , her mate , @entity5 said			1
@entity17 penguin zookeeper @entity159 said in the university 's release ' i have always known that @entity8 is spectacular and extremely special			1
it was fun to see the excitement everyone had for her at the @entity5 vet @entity166 know she has an even larger fan base now			0
she is an extremely tough girl and will not go down without a fight			0
' ' she is the oldest @entity1 penguin in captivity currently , ' @entity159 said in @entity5 's video			1
' she is a record - holder for a female			0
no female has ever made it to 40 before			0
