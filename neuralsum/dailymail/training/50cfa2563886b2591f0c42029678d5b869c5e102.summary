click here to to read chief sports writer @entity2 's column on why football owners like @entity4 are ruining great clubs such as @entity6			0
it was long before the match in @entity9 that @entity10 raised the compensation issue with @entity12			1
the club found out the fixture would be played behind closed doors on october 3 , after @entity16 were disciplined for the racist behaviour of their fans during a match against @entity20 in september			1
by then quite a few @entity10 supporters were committed to travel			2
@entity22 is one of the most problematic @entity25 trips			2
it is expensive and requires a visa			0
the only way to keep costs down and complete the paperwork in time is to book well in advance			0
one imagines many of @entity10 ’s travelling fans would have been making the necessary arrangements not long after august 28 when the draw was made			1
@entity10 fans were n't allowed to travel to watch their side play against @entity16 on tuesday @entity39 's @entity12 said they had no policy in place to help compensate @entity10 fans who had booked the trip @entity9 were also fined £ 158,000 by @entity12 , leading @entity10 to ask , not unreasonably , what part of that might be set aside to compensate their followers for non-refundable expenses			1
@entity39 ’s @entity12 replied they had no policy on this matter			2
is n’t that incredible , when you consider the issues that have vexed @entity12 over the years ; the reams of regulations that clubs must obey when competing in the @entity55 , 41 pages in total before sweating the small stuff like car park allocations and mixed zones ? did you know clubs are told precisely when to begin and end the ‘ walk on ’ music and the @entity55 anthem ? and yet nobody thought it necessary to draw up a process to give innocent fans their money back if @entity12 cancel access to a fixture at late notice			1
a rough estimate of the reimbursement cost for @entity10 ’s support is £ 50,000			2
roughly 100 were already booked for @entity9 when @entity12 intervened , with average costs of £ 500			1
that would still leave @entity12 with £ 100,000 spare , even after a show of goodwill			0
while they were at it , they could cover the costs of the @entity84 fans , too , also barred from the @entity85 having done nothing wrong			0
around 300 @entity16 fans were in the main stand , despite the match being played behind closed doors @entity12 had ordered the match to be played behind closed doors because of racist behaviour by @entity16 fans to add insult to injury , @entity9 ’s stadium was not satisfactorily sealed when @entity10 visited			1
there were roughly 650 tickets available , divided between representatives of the two clubs , media , the parents of ball boys and sponsors			0
it would appear a high percentage of those tickets ended up on the black market , judging by the sprinkling of @entity9 fans , wearing colours and carrying banners			0
@entity10 , meanwhile , were laying on a function back home for the fans who could not travel , complete with match coverage , food , drink and club celebrities			1
their reaction on hearing the noise from the interlopers in @entity9 was bemusement at best			0
@entity10 may well decide to compensate their fans anyway , but it should not be down to them			2
when the club were fined £ 50million for breaking @entity12 ’s @entity125 rules it quickly became apparent where that money was going — to their wealthy rivals			0
what about @entity9 ’s £ 158,000 — and why do n’t @entity12 have rules in place to govern compensation in the event of ground closure ? it is almost as if it suits them to be so careless			0
@entity140 scored @entity10 's opener as they took a 2 - 0 lead against @entity16 on tuesday @entity10 threw away a two - goal lead as @entity144 ( left ) and @entity145 scored in the second half for the hosts			1

@entity10 drew 2 - 2 with @entity16 in the @entity55
the match was played behind closed doors *due* to racist behaviour by @entity16 fans in the past
city fans who had booked the trip to @entity22 were n't reimbursed by @entity12
