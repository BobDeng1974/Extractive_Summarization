by @entity0 last updated at 3:24 am on 18th august 2011 former @entity2 chief sir @entity3 has been cleared of any misconduct during the phone - hacking inquiry @entity8 ’s former chief and his top officer , who were forced to quit over the phone - hacking scandal , launched a furious broadside at the police watchdog as they were cleared of misconduct yesterday			1
former met commissioner sir @entity3 and @entity14 commissioner @entity14 reacted with anger after the @entity16 announced that they had been exonerated over their handling of the inquiry			1
sir @entity3 took a swipe at the watchdog for wasting resources , while mr @entity14 was said to be ‘ utterly furious ’ that weeks after he was forced to stand down the @entity16 probe had been dropped			1
the development came a day after a bombshell letter emerged which suggested that phone hacking was common knowledge at the @entity27 while @entity28 – who later went to work for @entity29 as his no 10 spin chief before resigning over the hacking furore – was editor			0
@entity8 was plunged into crisis after it lost sir @entity3 and mr @entity14 , who had a combined 64 years of experience			1
both men quit over the furore surrounding the force ’s hiring of hacking suspect @entity39 – a former @entity27 deputy editor – as a pr consultant and sir @entity3 ’s £ 12,000 freebie at a luxury health spa promoted by mr @entity39 , who was arrested in july over alleged phone hacking			1
yesterday sir @entity3 criticised the @entity16 for scrutinising his free five - week stay at the @entity47 resort in @entity48 while he recovered after having a pre-cancerous tumour removed from his leg in january			0
@entity52 president , sir @entity51 fell foul of politicians because of his plain speaking during the officers but that could make him popular with officers			0
he went for the job in 2008 but missed out narrowly and worked as head of police in @entity61 an officer without controversy , acting commissioner @entity64 has worked his way up the ranks			1
he surprised mps by saying he though about closing down @entity68 and faced criticism for keeping a low profile during the riots @entity72 has spent six years at the @entity2 as head of the specialist crime command			1
he is currently the chief constable of @entity75 which was praised by @entity29 last week for its work on combating gangs @entity79 is a well - liked ex-chief constable of @entity81 and is now acting deputy commissioner at the @entity2			1
he is considered a strong candidate as he supervised @entity84 and the policing of the @entity86 sir @entity3 said : ‘ the outcome of the @entity89 ’s referral of myself to the @entity16 is as i would have expected it to be			0
i regret resources have had to be expended on this matter			0
‘ the @entity16 ’s comments about my acceptance of assistance from a friend through my family , unconnected to my professional life , of services from @entity47 ’ @entity104 , which they chose to examine under their powers without any external referral , does in my view fall a little short of full and proper context			0
however , this is a matter for their judgment			0
’ @entity64 - 2/1 @entity72 - 5/2 @entity79 - 7/2 @entity51 - 7/1 source : @entity113 yesterday the @entity16 also threw out allegations of misconduct against former met assistant commissioner @entity116 and former deputy assistant commissioner @entity117			0
but investigators are still pressing ahead with a probe into claims that mr @entity14 secured a job for mr @entity39 ’s daughter			1
the officer is accused of arranging a civilian role at @entity8 for @entity125 , 27			0
mr @entity14 resigned last month after he came under fire for his handling of the phone hacking inquiry and his close friendship with mr @entity39 , 60 , during a time when he was involved in the hacking investigation			1
@entity16 deputy chairman @entity132 said he would face no further action in relation to his handling of the phone hacking investigation , although she said investigators agreed with mr @entity14 ’s own admission that his decision not to review the hacking evidence in 2009 was ‘ poor ’			1
home secretary @entity141 said top @entity143 policeman @entity142 was not in the running for the job mr @entity14 said : ‘ i am disappointed with the @entity16 ’s decision to investigate my peripheral involvement in recruitment process of @entity39 ’s daughter			1
i strongly deny any wrongdoing and i am completely confident that i will be exonerated			1
’ on tuesday a letter emerged written by disgraced former @entity27 royal reporter @entity152 four years ago in which he claimed that hacking was ‘ widely discussed ’ at the paper until mr @entity28 banned all reference to it			2
the letter was part of a batch of papers made public by the @entity163 culture committee			0
its release has led to claims by @entity168 mp @entity167 that it pointed to ‘ one of the largest cover - ups ’ he had seen in his lifetime			2
the new documents also reveal that mr @entity152 said mr @entity28 had promised he could have his job back if he did n’t implicate colleagues and was paid nearly £ 250,000 by the company – even after he was jailed in 2007			1
mr @entity167 has said the latest claims suggested previous evidence given by mr @entity28 to the committee was ‘ at best misleading and probably deceptive ’			1
explosive correspondence released by the @entity181 select committee on tuesday , which includes allegations pointing to a massive corporate cover - up by @entity184 , has re-ignited the phone - hacking scandal			0
here , @entity187 editor @entity186 examines what it means for the main protagonists			0
@entity28 the ex-news of the @entity193 editor has always insisted he was unaware of any phone hacking on his watch			0
a dynamite letter from @entity152 , written in 2007 upon his release from jail for hacking royal mobile phone messages , claims that the practice was widely discussed at editorial meetings until mr @entity28 himself banned further references to it			1
@entity152 also says mr @entity28 offered to let him keep his job if he agreed not to implicate the paper ’s staff in hacking when his case came to court			1
denial : @entity28 has insisted he was unaware of any phone hacking on his watch if true – and these are only allegations at this stage – the former no 10 communications director would stand accused of lying to @entity215 , perjury ( he denied knowledge of hacking on oath , in the @entity220 perjury trial ) and conspiracy to intercept phone messages			0
mr @entity28 , who would face a lengthy jail term , is on police bail and unable to defend himself at this stage			2
@entity226 the former executive chairman of @entity184 , which owned the @entity228 , is at the heart of the latest revelations			0
the @entity152 letter , an appeal against his dismissal , was copied to mr @entity234 in march 2007			2
mr @entity234 faces the damaging allegation that , for years , he did not pass on the letter to police			1
four days after @entity152 sent his letter , mr @entity234 appeared before mps and did not disclose any of its contents			2
instead , he said : ‘ i believe absolutely that @entity28 [ @entity241 ] did not have knowledge of what was going on			0
’ mr @entity234 resigned earlier this year , but could be taken back before mps and accused of misleading @entity215			2
@entity244 questions : @entity244 he has insisted he did not know the full extent of hacking at the @entity228			0
in particular , he told @entity2 that at the time he personally authorised a £ 700,000 pay - off to one hacking victim , he was not aware of evidence that suggested phone hacking was not limited to a single rogue @entity228 journalist ( @entity152 )			1
the letters published on tuesday show that @entity253 , an @entity255 lawyer , and former editor @entity256 both dispute this			0
they say mr @entity244 was told about an email implicating a second reporter			2
@entity2 want to know if mr @entity244 misled @entity215			1
they are also likely to ask whether it ’s conceivable that he was unaware of the 2007 @entity152 letter			0
@entity264 @entity184 has repeatedly defended itself by reference to an internal investigation conducted by the legal firm @entity267 ( @entity268 )			0
it was commissioned in the wake of receipt of @entity152 ’s letter , and concluded – after the examination of 2,500 emails between @entity228 staff – that there was nothing to suggest mr @entity28 or other senior executives knew about @entity152 ’s activities			2
in his humbling appearance before @entity2 last month , and with @entity184 using the @entity268 report to defend itself , @entity264 said the firm had been employed to ‘ find out what the hell was going on ’			1
this caused fury at @entity268 , which wrote to mps describing this claim as ‘ inaccurate and misleading ’			0
the lawyers say they had a narrow remit to look only at whether @entity152 ’s claims would stack up in an employment tribunal – not to give @entity184 a ‘ good conduct certificate ’			2
@entity29 the greater the trouble mr @entity28 finds himself in , the worse it gets for the prime minister , whose judgment in appointing the spin doctor – and taking him into @entity298 – is called into ever greater question			2
if the allegations against mr @entity28 are proved , mr @entity29 will have to explain whether he was lied to , or if he did n’t bother to ask key questions about his friend ’s past			2
uncertain : if allegations against @entity28 are proved , @entity29 will have to give plenty of answers to questions about his spin doctor critics ask if it is really likely that mr @entity28 was given such a key job without aides approaching @entity152 , or senior @entity184 executives , to check if any new allegations were likely to emerge			1
others – notably @entity3 commissioner sir @entity3 – have resigned for having looser links to @entity184 executives implicated in the hacking scandal than those held by the pm .			0

@entity14 also cleared of wrongdoing
but mr @entity14 faces fresh probe over claims he helped secure @entity39 ' daughter a job with the @entity2
