a new poll of @entity2 voters shows @entity3 with a commanding lead over his potential @entity6 presidential challengers			1
@entity3 was far and away @entity6 voters and right leaning independents ' first choice in the all - important primary state in @entity12 's latest survey			1
nearly a third of respondents said they 'd support @entity3 , the former governor of neighboring state @entity15 , if their state 's primary , slated for february of 2016 , were held now			1
his about - face has turned the race upside down and could present a problem for former @entity34 gov. @entity33 , who shares the same base of donors and campaign hands as establishment - backed @entity3			1
the two men met yesterday in @entity39 , where @entity3 has a home , for a previously planned meeting			1
it 's unclear from aides ' description of the get together what , if any , agreement the former governors came to about the 2016 race			0
' governor @entity33 enjoyed visiting with governor @entity3 today in @entity50 , ' @entity33 's spokeswoman @entity49 told the @entity51 , but would n't say more			2
' every interaction i â€™ve observed between them has been positive and friendly , ' former @entity39 gov. @entity55 , a @entity3 ally , told the @entity51			2
i 'm ' very confident it was a gentlemanly conversation			0
' if the both @entity3 and @entity33 proceed with presidential campaigns , their relationship will likely become a whole lot less ' gentlemanly			0
' to clinch the nomination , the like - minded politicians must be able to differentiate themselves for voters			0
last time around : @entity33 ( left ) campaigned for @entity3 in 2012 but the two might go head - to - head in 2016 so far @entity3 , with his high name @entity67 left over from the last presidential contest , is winning the battle			1
