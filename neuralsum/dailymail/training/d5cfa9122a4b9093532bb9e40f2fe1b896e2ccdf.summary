by @entity0 published : 10:46 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 08:17 est , 14 march 2013 a pioneering @entity2 surgeon is helping @entity4 bomb blast victims walk again by creating prosthetic limbs - made from drainpipes and tyres			1
@entity8 has created 114 makeshift false legs for amputees who have been injured during the bloody conflict in the war - torn country			1
mr @entity14 , a surgeon at @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , uses his spare time to create the prostheses using a groundbreaking technique			1
from @entity15 , @entity16 , is helping @entity4 bomb blast victims get back on their feet by creating prosthetic limbs made from drainpipes and tyres he melts down the drainpipes - which are donated by a @entity29 businessman - in a furnace before sculpting them into leg - shapes around a mould of each victim he then fashions artificial feet using recycled rubber taken from car tyres he spends up to a day - and - a - half melting down the drainpipes - which are donated by a @entity29 businessman - in a furnace before sculpting them into leg - shapes around a mould of each victim			1
he then fashions artificial feet using recycled rubber taken from car tyres			1
it means the process can produce an artificial limb which usually costs the @entity2 £ 1,200 - for just £ 30			1
mr @entity14 flew out to @entity51 - on the @entity29 @entity4 border - two weeks ago to fit them to victims using metal pins and leather straps			2
he is helped by a team of six technicians from @entity59 in a makeshift clinic and workshop to help those hurt by the two - year war that has so - far claimed 70,000 lives			2
mr @entity14 , from @entity16 , said yesterday : " i became involved in this in 2007 after the earthquake in my home country of @entity59			1
' i flew back to help and ended up doing hundreds of amputations			0
' afterwards i realised nothing was being done for them after the amputation			0
' they would be left to either become beggars or to die in hospitals of bed sores			0
one of the 114 beneficaries is seven - year - old @entity78 , from @entity59 then and now : mr @entity14 feared not enough was being done to help amputees such as @entity78 up and about : the limbs will last up to seven years and even if they break , they are not difficult to replace ' we 're very lucky in the west , we have things like the @entity2 to help us through , but other in the less developed countries they have nothing , and their corrupt governments do n't care enough about them			2
' the limbs we have in the west are very good , but far too expensive , but after some research i found a similar technique had been developed in @entity59 in 1962			0
' i modified it and realised that it could be done really cheaply to give these people their lives back			0
' the limbs will last up to seven years and even if they break it 's not hard to replace them			0
' they are not as sophisticated as a western limb but a prosthetic limb costing up to a £ 1,000 here in @entity103 will be of little use to someone who does n't have the money , technology and tools to maintain it			2
' we can make limbs from drainpipe material for £ 30 and provide them free to those in need			1
' the patients go back to their profession , to study , they go back to colleges , university , take up jobs			0
@entity119 made : mr @entity14 melts down the drainpipes - which are donated by a @entity29 businessman - in a furnace before sculpting them into leg - shapes around a mould of each victim it means the process can produce an artificial limb which usually costs the @entity2 £ 1,200 - for just £ 30 work in progress : a technician from the work shop in @entity59 making an artificial leg basic : mr @entity14 said that while the limbs are n't highly sophisticated , they work well for people in poorer countries who do n't have the money or technology to maintain them ' a group of ten volunteers and training technicians from @entity4 have been selected to take up this job in future			1
' i would say it is like comparing a 1962 @entity147 to a @entity148 , they both work as cars , so there is no shame			0
' in 2005 , mr @entity14 set up the @entity153 , non-profit organisation of volunteer overseas @entity59 doctors , which helps fund the artificial limb materials			1
he hopes to take the limbs to other countries such as @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity163 @entity162 , @entity164 and @entity165			0
@entity166 , chief executive of @entity167 said , ' we are very proud of mr @entity14 and his altruistic work with amputees in @entity4			2
' it demonstrates the commitment and dedication of all staff who work for the @entity153			0
