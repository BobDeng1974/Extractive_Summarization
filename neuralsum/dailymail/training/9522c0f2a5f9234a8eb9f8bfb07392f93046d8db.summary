ahead of @entity3 's @entity2 semi-final clash with @entity5 's @entity4 in @entity6 , @entity0 takes a closer look at @entity9 's side			1
player of the tournament : @entity12 ( 5 games , 4 goals ) with the exception of @entity18 and @entity19 , no side in the competition has relied so heavily on their star player			1
four of @entity3 ’s five games have needed a sprinkle of @entity12 magic to drag @entity9 ’s side back from the abyss			1
without the four - time @entity28 winner they probably would n’t have made it out of their group			0
@entity12 , unsurprisingly , was the architect			0
his wonderful assist , that saw him drive at the heart of @entity50 ’s defence from a central position before laying the ball off to @entity41 , conjured up memories of @entity54 setting up @entity55 against @entity18 in 1990			2
unstoppable : @entity41 's extra-time winner against @entity42 owed much to @entity12 's build - up play lowlight : their over-reliance on @entity12 ‘ every time we recover the ball , we try to pass to him as he 's the best player we have , ’ said @entity61 after their last - 16 win against @entity42			1
this dependence has been far too evident at times			0
despite boasting some outstanding talents in attack , the likes of @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 have failed to reproduce their club form in @entity18 , putting more pressure on @entity12 to make the difference			2
fortunately for them the @entity79 man has duly obliged			0
impact : @entity71 ( left ) scored the winner against @entity37 but @entity3 have been too reliant on @entity12 best goal : @entity12 v @entity84 , 1 - 0 group stage , @entity86 , @entity87 the two - time @entity2 winners were on the brink of an embarrassing draw with @entity84 that would have both seriously dented their confidence and put their place in the knockout stages in doubt , when up stepped @entity12			2
picking the ball up 30 yards from goal in the 91st minute , he drifted in from the right and curled an unstoppable left - foot strike into the far corner to make it two wins from two			0
stunner : @entity12 bends the ball into the top corner from outside the box to seal a late 1 - 0 win against @entity84 how has the boss performed ? @entity3 are in the last four because of @entity12 , not @entity9			1
throughout the tournament there have been rumours circulating that @entity9 has little respect from the players within the @entity3 camp , particularly following a bust - up with @entity12 at half - time in their opening match against @entity117			1
reports in @entity3 and @entity119 suggest their captain ‘ ordered ’ @entity9 to switch from a 5 - 3 - 2 to a 4 - 3 - 3 and bring on @entity121 and @entity71 for the second half			2
@entity3 have played 4 - 3 - 3 in every match since			0
in control ? rumours have circulated that @entity9 does not have the respect of some @entity3 players top scorer : @entity12 ( 4 goals ) killer stat : the four strikers that @entity9 chose to support @entity12 in @entity18 scored 83 goals between them at top clubs in @entity134 last season			1
@entity70 , @entity72 , @entity71 and @entity136 have one between them at this @entity2			0
results in 9pm kick - offs : played 0 , w 0 , d 0 , l 0 @entity142 v @entity141 : played on @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 0 , l 0 ; played on @entity141 , @entity145 , @entity144 0 , l 0 @entity146 to semi-finals : @entity149 winners ( 2 - 1 vs @entity117 , 1 - 0 v @entity84 , 3 - 2 vs @entity150 ) last 16 : @entity3 1 - 0 @entity42 quarter - final : @entity3 1 - 0 @entity37 @entity153 ranking : 5th likely line - up : ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity155 ; @entity61 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 ; @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 ; @entity12 , @entity71 , @entity72 @entity2 pedigree : winners in 1978 and 1986			1
finalists in 1930 and 1990			0
they have never lost in any of the four @entity2 semi-finals they have played in			0

@entity12 has been the star for @entity3 , scoring four goals so far
@entity41 played poorly against @entity42 but came up with a *crucial* strike in extra-time to send his *country* into the last eight
the @entity172 have relied too heavily on @entity12 in @entity18
@entity9 may not have the full respect of his players according to some reports
@entity3 face @entity4 in @entity6 on *wednesday*
