by @entity0 published : 13:51 est , 26 february 2014 @entity2 : 16:05 est , 26 february 2014 contact : a source reporting directly to the @entity4 had more than one meeting with @entity6 in 1993 and 1994 - contradicting earlier government reports newly - released court documents have revealed that an @entity4 source had a meeting with former @entity11 leader @entity6 in 1993			1
the meeting between the informant that the @entity4 worked with and the now - dead terror chief produced such specific intel for the @entity4 that they were able to thwart an attack against a @entity18 cruise liner and another in @entity19			1
the previously - unknown meeting came to light because @entity22 , a disgruntled @entity4 agent , filed a discrimination lawsuit against the agency , and during the court hearing , one of his bosses told of the agent 's successes at the bureau			0
the @entity31 reported that former @entity4 official @entity32 testified on mr @entity34 's behalf in the 2010 discrimination case			0
mr @entity32 told the court how mr @entity34 was able to cultivate a source who was closely - tied to another @entity11 leader , @entity39 , commonly known as the ' blind sheik ' who was responsible for the 1993 attack on the @entity42			2
the source , who was described as being ' very in tight , close ' with the @entity11 leadership , was reportedly in regular contact with the @entity4 when he met personally with @entity6 at some point in 1993			1
as a result of that meeting , the @entity4 was given enough information to stop planned attacks on a @entity51 in @entity19 and helped reveal two previously - secret terror cells in @entity53			1
working back - channels : the revelations came as a part of a discrimination suit filed by @entity4 agent @entity34 ( pictured ) who is the one who cultivated the source that got in direct contact with @entity6 ' it was the only source i know in the bureau where we had a source right in @entity11 , directly involved , ' said mr @entity32 , who headed the @entity4 's office in @entity19 at the time			1
the @entity31 revealed no further details about the @entity18 cruise liner that was reportedly suggested as a potential target			1
the news of the @entity4 's source meeting with @entity6 on more than one occassion in 1993 and 1994 will make waves because it comes in direct contrast to previous testimony that was used as the ' accepted ' timeline of events leading up to the september 11 attacks			2
the @entity80 described the @entity4 's intelligence on @entity6 at the time as being ' at best cloudy ' and made no mention of a source who had direct contact with the terrorist			0
leader : the source was close with ' blind @entity40 ' @entity39 , the @entity11 official who was reportedly behind the 1993 bombing of the @entity42 it is unclear why the courtroom revelations - which were initially made in 2010 - were not unearthed until now but the former head of the @entity94 argues that the source was not directly related to the plot against the @entity42			2
' both the commission and the @entity99 government compiled a fair amount of evidence about the activities of the set of groups later best known as @entity11 during [ the early - 1990s ] , when the group was settling into @entity106			0
we did not delve as deeply in this period because it was so distant from the plotting that led directly to the 9/11 attack , ' @entity107 , the @entity94 's executive director , told the @entity31			0
the discrimination case came after mr @entity34 filed a suit against the bureau saying that he was sidelined after september 11 because his colleagues thought he was an @entity117			0
those assumptions were incorrect , as the highly decorated agent is actually @entity120 .			0

an @entity11 *insider* reportedly met with @entity6 more than once in 1993 and 1994 , as newly - released court *transcripts* reveal
@entity125 from the meeting helped the @entity4 thwart plans to attack a @entity18 cruise liner and a @entity51 in @entity19
comes as a contradiction to official government reports compiled for the @entity94 that said the @entity4 had no clear contacts with @entity6
