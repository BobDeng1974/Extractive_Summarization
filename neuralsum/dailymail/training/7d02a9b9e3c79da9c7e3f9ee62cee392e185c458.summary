but mr @entity5 said the sat - nav did not pick up that the road was a new 20mph zone and was still showing a 30mph limit , and that he drove around the bollard to get past traffic			1
he added : ‘ if i thought it was dangerous , i would n’t have done it			0
there was no traffic coming the other way ; the lights were on red			0
’ mr @entity5 received a letter last week notifying him of the ambulance service ’s decision			1
extenuating circumstances : mr @entity5 received an urgent call and drove too quickly down @entity75 and @entity76 , pictured , in @entity30			1
he also drove around a bollard to get ahead of traffic he said : ‘ there was no thanks whatsoever for my 15 years of service			1
i do not condone speeding but the punishment is brutal			0
‘ this has hit me harder than the death of my own parents			0
the ambulance service has broken my heart			2
i have shed tears over this			0
’ the decision to dismiss him comes just three months after the same ambulance service issued an urgent plea for volunteers after its number of drivers dropped from 45 to 28			2
a spokesman for @entity98 said at the time that the county needed 90 extra ambulances to meet life - saving response times targets			0
during his time as a volunteer first responder , mr @entity5 attended more than 2,000 call - outs and saved numerous lives , calling it the ‘ most rewarding thing you can do ’			1
he added : ‘ if there is even a slim chance of saving someone then i am there – at least they will have a chance			0
i get people coming up to me in the street saying “ you saved my child ” , or “ you helped my mum			0
” ’ several hundred people in the @entity30 area have now signed a petition calling for mr @entity5 to be reinstated			1
one man whose life was saved by mr @entity5 condemned the decision to sack him			1
father - of - two @entity126 , who was treated by mr @entity5 in 2007 when he suffered a massive heart attack at home , said yesterday : ‘ it is very petty			1
if it was not for @entity132 i would not be walking around today and my children would not have a father			0
’ support : at least 60 people have signed a petition supporting the sacked man since monday mr @entity5 ’s son , performing arts student @entity140 , 19 , who also worked as a first responder , has now resigned in support of his father			1
he said : ‘ i had to stand by my father			0
he has dedicated a large part of his life to the service and i know it would be difficult for him			0
‘ as well as his job , he would do at least 20 hours a week volunteer work with the service , and most of it was overnight			2
he has spent most christmases and @entity157 ’s @entity156 going out to emergencies			0
i ca n’t even tell you the last time i spent a @entity161 with my father , as he has always been out on calls			0
’ ambulance drivers employed by the trust have to get to 75 per cent of most serious calls in eight minutes , and the latest figures , for july , show it hit 84 per cent of its target in @entity170			2
a spokesman for campaign group @entity172 said : ‘ we think it ’s outrageous			0
