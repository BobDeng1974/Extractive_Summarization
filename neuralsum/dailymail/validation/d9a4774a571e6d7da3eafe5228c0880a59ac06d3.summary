women with vaginal piercings are to be classed as victims of female genital mutilation , health chiefs have said			1
under new @entity12 rules to be introduced next month , any woman whose labia or clitoris has been pierced must be recorded as suffering @entity4 , a procedure which is illegal in the @entity14			1
the mandatory reporting regulations were sent to medical staff by the @entity17 , which said it is would start classifying the piercings ' within an abusive context '			1
it means that even women who have consented to the piercing for cosmetic reasons will be deemed as a potential victim of crime			1
those responsible for carrying out the piercing could also be implicated for committing a criminal offence			2
the new rules are in line with guidance from the @entity32 , which last year classified piercing as ' harmful procedures ' that are considered under the bracket of @entity4			1
there is already much debate about whether genital surgery procedures such as so - called ' designer vagina ' operations should be treated by as @entity4			1
last week , mps released a report which said police , midwives and campaigners remain confused over whether the operations fall within fgm laws			0
under the @entity48 , it is illegal to cut girls ' genitals unless there is a genuine justification			0
the exemptions in the @entity48 refer to operations carried out on the grounds of physical or mental health and do not cover cosmetic surgery			0
the @entity58 said the act should be amended to reiterate that female genital cosmetic surgery on those who do not have a physical or mental health justification is potentially illegal			2
the government has previously said it has no plans to make these changes			0
some 170,000 women and girls are estimated to be living with @entity4 in the @entity14			1
more than 2,600 women and girls who went through @entity4 have been treated by the @entity12 since last september , with 499 women and girls with @entity4 seen in acute @entity12 trusts in @entity73 in january alone			1
more than 200 fgm - related cases were investigated by the police nationally in the past five years			0
a @entity17 man said : ' while there are challenges in this area and adult women may have genital piercings , in some communities girls are forced to have them			0
the @entity32 has quite rightly defined this as a form of @entity4			2
' we are taking every precaution to record genital piercings that have been done within an abusive context			0
' the new data collection will help build a picture of the scale and the nature of the problem we are facing			0
we are continually working on ways to improve and develop the @entity12 response to this terrible practice			2

new @entity12 rules will apply to any woman whose labia or clitoris is pierced
even women who consented to piercing will be potential victims of crime
mandatory reporting regulations sent to medics by @entity111 chiefs
