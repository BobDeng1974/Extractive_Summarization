wine connoisseurs may be prepared to pay hundreds of pounds for rare bottles stowed in @entity3 chateaus for decades , but for most people supermarket plonk has to do			0
now there ’s a gadget that claims to make cheap wine taste better , by accelerating the ageing process using high frequency sound waves			1
the @entity11 , which is yet to be launched , will use ultrasound to ' age ' bargain bottles in just 20 minutes by altering the compounds in the wine and make it more drinkable			1
the gadget relies on patented technology that uses ultrasound to change the molecular and chemical structure of wine to make it taste smoother and more intense			1
usually such an ageing process takes years for molecules to change due to the interaction between each other , but ultrasound forces these reactions to happen faster , changing their properties and the taste of the wine			1
the @entity11 , which has yet to be launched , will use ultrasound to ' age ' bargain bottles in just 20 minutes by altering the compounds in the wine to make it more drinkable to use the gadget , people will have to pour water into the base then place a bottle of wine inside it			1
they will then press a button on the gadget - or a smartphone app - to say whether the wine if white , red or rose			2
they can choose a suitable time to ' age ' the wine by setting the timer			0
the device takes 20 minutes or less to change the molecular and chemical structure of wine , using ultrasound			2
this will bring out aromas usually only associated with vintage wines , soften tannins and enhance the wine 's flavour , the company claims			1
the company writes on its @entity77 page : ‘ when used on wine the [ ultrasound ] @entity11 promotes further extraction of flavours , aromas and mouth feel from interactions among phenolics and anthocyanins ( types of additives and pigments ) and which results in smoother more integrated mouth feel and a smooth , flavourful lingering finish			1
‘ the device allows for a more energetic reaction between the molecules and therefore a more complete molecular change , it explained			0
natural gases such as oxygen and sulphur dioxide are expelled from the bottle , giving it a longer shelf life			0
‘ this results in an improvement in taste , aroma , mouth feel and an overall enjoyment in the wine drinking experience , ’ the company claims			0
users of the gadget will be able to operate it using a smartphone app and @entity116 connection , as well as buttons on the gadget , so they can run the device for a specific time to create a wine that suits their palette			2
the @entity11 will ‘ age ’ a rose , @entity124 or @entity125 for around 10 minutes , to release extra flavours , while @entity127 and @entity128 can take twice that long			0
it can also be used to ‘ reinvigorate ’ previously opened and re-corked bottles of wine , its inventors say			0
the launch of the @entity11 is planned for june next year and it 's available to pre-order on @entity77 from $ 129 ( £ 82 )			1
the gadget relies on patented technology that uses ultrasound to change the molecular and chemical structure of wine			2
users have to pour water into it ( 1 ) before placing the bottle inside ( 2 ) and set the timer ( 3 ) to decide how much they want to age the tipple , to make it taste smoother and more intense ( illustrated right )			0
