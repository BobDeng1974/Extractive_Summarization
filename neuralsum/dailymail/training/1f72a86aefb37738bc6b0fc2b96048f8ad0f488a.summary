by @entity0 a judge on friday imposed a 50 - year sentence on a woman convicted of killing her husband using pliers , a box cutter and a plastic baseball bat during a jealous rage			1
justice @entity9 , who previously described 51 - year - old @entity11 's actions as ' monstrous savagery , ' told her he chose not to impose a life sentence because of her brain injury			1
her lawyers argued that the injury contributed to mental problems , leading to the violent outburst in june 2011			1
@entity11 stands up after hearing her verdict of guilty by @entity20 in the murder of her husband @entity22 in may a medical examiner reported that @entity24 was beaten and strangled and suffered cuts , punctures and bruises from head to toe			1
his naked body was found in a bathtub in their @entity33 apartment			2
mr @entity22 suffered extensive multiple blunt and sharp force injuries to the head , neck , torso , limbs and genitalia , @entity35 said in the autopsy report			0
he also was strangled with sufficient force to break the hyoid bone of his neck , @entity35 testified last year			2
the hyoid bone is the bone at the top of the neck under the chin			0
the judge concluded that the injuries were inflicted with a plastic baseball bat , razor , wooden and metal rods from broken towel racks , a pair of needle - nosed pliers , and , perhaps , other implements			1
' any one of these injuries standing alone manifests a depraved indifference to the value of human life , ' @entity9 said			0
' taken together , they reflect a monstrous savagery and cruelty that defies comprehension			1
' @entity11 looks toward family members as she is led into the courtroom at the @entity69 in @entity33 on monday for the start of her murder trial			1
it is clear from dr. @entity35 ’s testimony that @entity24 , while alive , was subjected to extreme cruelty that rises to the level of torture , ' assistant attorney general @entity74 said			0
from his head to his lower extremities , he was cut , sliced , punctured , beaten and burnt			0
most of the injuries he sustained were accompanied by hemorrhaging , which is indicative that his heart was beating and he was alive when he was beaten , repeatedly cut , sliced and punctured			0
' this is not , if there is such a thing , a ‘ run of the mill ’ murder , ' she continued			0
' it is a murder characterized by , in the words of the definition of depraved indifference , such outrageous , revolting , savage , brutal or shocking conduct that it readily demonstrates an almost total lack of concern or appreciation for the value of human life on the part of the defendant			0
it is a murder involving literal torture			0
' ' ms. @entity11 had injuries on her body that , in combination with her mental health issues , could represent the trigger to an unreasonable reaction and show of force against mr. @entity22 ' defence attorney @entity113 wrote			2
' admittedly , the court found that the severity of mr. @entity22 ’s injuries and duration of time it would take to inflict those injuries indicates sufficient intent or knowledge to support a conviction			0
' however , the severity of the injuries also represents an extreme and unexpected departure from 48 years of no criminal activity , strongly suggesting that her mental health status played a substantial role in what unfolded that night , ' he concluded			2
guilty : an emotional @entity11 , 51 , of @entity33 apologized to her husband ¿ s family and said just before being sentenced that she regrets her actions the night of june 12 to 13 , 2011 a neighbor testified that @entity11 was angry because her husband had been calling another woman			1
experts gave conflicting testimony at @entity11 ’s trial about whether she knew right from wrong the night she killed her husband			1
prosecution and defense experts testified that @entity11 ’s cognitive skills and memory are impaired because of the removal of the tumor			1
however , she was found competent to stand trial on friday , she addressed the judge and suggested she would have been better off letting " nature take its course " instead of having surgery 10 years earlier to remove a brain tumor			1
@entity11 also apologized to her husband 's family			1
. i can honestly say i 've prayed for you			0
i do feel your sorrow			0
he was my husband , ' she said			2
later , she looked at her own family and said , ' @entity155 will make each day better than the day before , and i 'm confident i 'll get the help i need			0
prosecutors sought a life sentence for @entity11			2
the defense asked the judge to impose 20 to 25 years , and said she 'd likely die in prison even with that sentence			2

51 - year - old @entity11 actions were described as ' monstrous savagery '
@entity11 used a box - cutter , plastic baseball bat and pliers to kill her husband @entity173 three years *ago*
@entity11 had *pleaded* not guilty by reason of insanity
