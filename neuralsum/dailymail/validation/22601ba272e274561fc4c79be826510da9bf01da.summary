' we 've got fans on the pitch			1
the game 's still going on '			1
that 's not me making a mess of @entity8 's infamous words from @entity9 in 1966 when the boys in red won the @entity12			2
that was @entity15 's spontaneous reaction on commentary when some @entity18 fans piled onto the playing area towards the end of their team 's semi-final at home to @entity24			1
of course they were scenes that no one wanted to see			0
except that they very nearly were			0
because they were a hare 's breath from what we saw when @entity34 went through to make it 4 - 2			1
only time surely makes that a less controversial incident ? @entity18 fans invaded the pitch after their @entity39 win over @entity24 on saturday night and are seen taunting the away supporters as a line of police keeps them apart thousands stream onto the pitch after the match , which was moved to saturday evening by the @entity45 @entity34 races through to score @entity48 's fourth goal in the 1966 @entity12 final with @entity50 the @entity39 is a tournament that we were told had lost its lustre			1
and attendances may well have endorsed that			0
but this season , with the @entity39 succumbing to the scheduling charms of their new telly twins the @entity45 and @entity56 , the tournament seems to have taken on a new lease of life			1
the kind of effervescent and exciting competition in which frequent nostalgic reruns of great @entity12 days somewhat ironically often includes the sight of fans celebrating on the pitch			1
not that that makes that group of @entity18 fans ' behaviour justifiable			1
although you might debate that a @entity76 derby that does n't kick - off until saturday tea time could just be asking for such a response ? but the timing was because , i can only assume , the slots were preordained for the @entity45 to include saturday and monday evenings			1
while @entity56 had saturday lunchtime and sunday afternoon			2
and with the @entity45 having first dibs on that deal			2
or in other words , @entity45 had what they 'd consider would be the ideal ties , with which to ensure the biggest possible audience , at the best possible times in their schedule			2
@entity45 presenter @entity93 and pundits @entity94 and @entity96 watch the pitch invasion monday night 's line - up for the @entity100 vs @entity99 featured @entity101 , @entity96 and @entity102 alongside @entity93 in the @entity104 studio @entity106 's team of ( from left ) @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 with the @entity39 pitchside at @entity113 vs @entity114 on saturday this was a situation @entity106 decided to create a silk purse from			1
why had n't we 'd been following this season 's giant killers @entity113 , a nation had cried , having been caught up in the excitement of what had gone on so far with their exploits ? well , on saturday lunchtime , @entity56 went free to air to answer that call and show us this season 's favourite @entity129 in action live against the @entity132 of ... @entity114			1
ok , not a hell of a mismatch , but @entity113 were still a great story			0
unfortunately this potential silk purse of a game became something of a pig 's ear on @entity113 's pitch			1
indeed , such a vision in mud it was , it required the club to provide @entity56 with a strange little turf rug on the touchline to put beneath their shiney plinth			0
nevertheless , there it was , an old school @entity39 that we could all watch , for nothing , and keep the momentum going on what was proving to be a vintage @entity12 season			2
by way of a precursor for the new @entity163 telly deal , this sense of occasion rolled on into monday night			0
again , this was a slot that may have driven the purists mad			0
@entity167 celebrates his winner for @entity99 against former club @entity100 on monday night @entity169 is mobbed by @entity18 supporters after scoring against @entity24 not to mention some fans from @entity172 who would have had to make their way back from @entity174 by any means necessary on a school night			1
but again , if you look at the bigger picture , it was the kind of game that could once again get people excited about the @entity12			0
and a formidable old pro line up of @entity101 , @entity96 , @entity102 and @entity182 alongside @entity93 all helped ensure that there was indeed the sense that what we were witnessing was an event			0
next up , more disruption for four teams whose replayed games will be shoe horned in to fit nicely for us folks at home			0
regardless of how it affects their @entity163 schedules			0
@entity198 reacts after @entity199 draws @entity99 to play @entity113 or @entity114 in the semis but i echo @entity198 's cry of ' woohooh ' when he drew his team @entity99 's ball for the semi final draw against either @entity113 or @entity114			1
yes , it has lacked a certain sense of tradition			0
yes , it has occasionally proven awkward for certain clubs , and their fans			0
and yes it provided that unsavoury moment at @entity215			0
but i celebrate the fact that the @entity39 has been put back in the forefront of our football thinking			2
and if it is because the @entity45 and @entity56 have decided between themselves to make it their own , then i 'll live with the negatives and embrace the positive .			2

@entity45 and @entity106 shared *coverage* of *weekend* 's @entity39 quarter - finals
@entity18 vs @entity24 was *marred* by pitch invasion at final whistle
many *blamed* the @entity45 for scheduling the game on saturday evening
@entity99 fans also faced travel chaos with @entity100 tie at @entity104
@entity106 did n't get a goal in either of their quarter - final matches
but both have *revitalised* a competition that had lost its lustre
