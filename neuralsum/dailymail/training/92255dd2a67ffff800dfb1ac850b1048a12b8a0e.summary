in the days leading up to laying siege and taking hostages in @entity2 , man @entity3 was engaged in rants on his personal @entity6 account which seemed to grow more strident as monday approached			1
the account appears to be genuine , although his tweets linked to a @entity11 page which has been pulled down			0
on december 10 , just five days before he stormed the @entity13 cafe with a sawn - off shotgun , @entity3 raged on @entity6 : ' shame on @entity16 and shame on those racist and terrorist @entity18 who support the governments of '			1
his anger is directed at @entity18 's foreign policy of sending troops off to fight overseas			1
the theme is similar to that of a letter addressed to @entity27 and posted on his website a year ago , saying the country 's foreign policy meant ' @entity18 and @entity18 will be attacked '			1
he railed against former prime minister @entity77 for criticising him and the fact he was ' for five years on bail conditions ' ; following his conviction for sending vile hate letters to the families of @entity18 soldiers who died fighting in @entity84			2
angry man : man @entity3 posted this tweet just under three weeks before his armed siege , criticising @entity88 ' and its allies ' for killing ' innocent civilians including women ' in wars like @entity93 and @entity84 a screenshot taken from man @entity3 's website before it was taken down			1
he used his website and his @entity11 and @entity6 pages to rant against @entity18 's involvement in foreign wars in a document from his website entitled ' who is @entity52 ' , @entity3 also likens himself to @entity105 founder @entity104 and says the 40 sexual assault charges against him - which relate to his practice as a ' spiritual healer ' in @entity109 - are false and politically motivated			1
in a letter written in @entity111 to ' @entity112 ' and placed on his website , he says there is no such thing as a ' moderate @entity45			0
and that ' i am neither an extremist nor a moderate , i am just a @entity45 , a @entity45 who tries to follow the @entity117 and the @entity118 of prophet @entity119			0
' much of his anger on his @entity6 page seems directed at @entity18 and the @entity88 for sending troops to fight in places like @entity93			1
' every day @entity88 and its allies kill the innocent civilians including women and children , ' he posted just under three weeks ago and in a @entity6 posted on november 29 in @entity111 , he wrote ' @entity129 or to kill @entity75 in @entity93 ? two weeks before that he wrote , ' will @entity18 be @entity130 state one day ? what do you think ? '			2
a letter in @entity111 to @entity75 , in which man @entity3 states ' there is no such thing as moderate @entity45 '			0
the page is littered with photographs and videos of alleged atrocities against @entity75 accompanied by comments from @entity3 including on november 9 , ' do @entity88 & its allies care about @entity143 ? @entity144 should be ashamed of yourself for your support '			0
his opposition to @entity18 and other western countries sending troops to fight in wars overseas is reflected in the letter sent to prime minister @entity27 , and obtained by @entity151			1
in the letter , which @entity3 makes the bogus claim of being a ' @entity154 and @entity155 ' , he says ' @entity18 and @entity18 will be attacked '			0
he writes a long - winded criticism about @entity18 's involvement in the @entity84 war , and a lame self - justification of his vile letters he sent - and was convicted for sending - to the families of soldiers killed over there			2
' since the message of my letters to the @entity18 authorities could n't be heard , i wrote letters to some of the families of deceased @entity18 soldiers and i requested them to voice against the war			2
' those families like the majority of the @entity18 were fed up with the wrong foreign policy			0
' @entity3 then complains that the @entity174 ' tried to take revenge ' and he ' was sentenced to 300 hours community service and two year good behaviour bond '			0
' when i talk about " peace " it 's not just playing with words but i am very serious and i have paid a price for that			0
' he then writes that like ' the majority of @entity18 ' he wanted ' peace on the earth including @entity18 ' and ' a secured world including @entity18 '			1
finally , he asks whether mr @entity27 's ' team are happy to have a live debate with me and'or my team '			2
he says if he lost the debate he would ' support the @entity18 government policy for the rest of my life '			0
but in his final sentence , @entity3 writes that he expected the prime minister to change its foreign policy if the debate proved it had ' made @entity18 unsafe ' and if it was proven ' that @entity18 and @entity18 will be attacked ' .			1

@entity2 gunman man @entity3 ranted on @entity6 in ' hate ' posts that appeared to escalate in the days leading up to siege
@entity3 rages against ' @entity16 ' and about @entity18 soldiers , angry at @entity18 's policy of sending troops overseas
he said @entity18 's foreign policy meant that ' @entity18 will be attacked '
@entity3 wrote to @entity27 last year demanding a ' live debate ' between the *pm* 's ' team ' and ' my team '
he said he wanted ' peace on the earth including @entity18 ' and a ' secured @entity18 '
likened himself to @entity104 and said sexual assault charges are ' political '
