by @entity0 published : 06:41 est , 27 june 2013 updated : 08:31 est , 27 june 2013 whether you 're seething with envy because you did n't get a ticket , giddy with delight that you wo n't be trudging around a farm all weekend , or simply do n't care either way , it 's impossible to forget about a certain little music festival going on in @entity9 this weekend			1
but those suffering the dreaded @entity11 can console themselves with the thought of how much cash they 'll be saving by not hanging out with the likes of the @entity17 and the @entity18 at @entity19			0
because before you 've even factored in the £ 210 ticket price , transport costs , sleeping bags - plus the all - important cold cider and hot food money once you 're actually at the event - every attendee is likely to spend an average of £ 200 on festival essentials before they set off			1
and it 's mostly alcohol and fancy dress for the boys , wet wipes and wellies for the girls			0
it 's @entity19 this weekend , if you had n't already noticed , and attendees will be packing their bags with over £ 200 worth of stuff before they even arrive in @entity9 , according to new research into festival spending while the girls grab wet wipes , loo roll , wellies and anti-bacterial hand gel , for the boys , alcohol and fancy dress came top of the list of things to pack for a festival it seems men pack ' to have a good time ' ( 58 per cent ) and women pack ' to be comfortable ' ( 61 per cent ) when it comes to attending festivals , according to a new survey			1
and in terms of what to bring , the essential items found in the backpacks of girls and boys also varies wildly			0
alcohol , funny fancy dress , snacks and sex protection came top of the men 's ' to buy ' lists ... while wet wipes , dry shampoo , wellies and anti-bacterial hand gel were the priorities for women			0
further ingredients for making a festival complete for male fans are drinking games , outdoor games such as footballs , paracetamol and water			2
women , on the other hand , also chose toilet roll , perfume , umbrellas , mirrors , sun lotion and waterproofs			0
festival - goers spend £ 200 each on packing essentials anti-bacterial hand gel is crucial to the girls women do n't like to go without their own loo roll attending @entity19 is no longer a case of hopping over the fence with nothing but the clothes you 're wearing and a fiver - these days festival fans arrive laden with alcohol , camping gear , stoves , bicycles , umbrellas and five days - worth of fancy dress in effort to save money while on site , many people resort to bringing in stashes of alcohol to last them five days , left , and energy drinks to keep them going for the whole festival , right respondents were asked how much they spent on items to take along with them , including a tent , and the average festival spend was £ 230 per person			1
@entity126 , marketing director at offeroftheday.co.uk who conducted the research , said : ' it seems that men and women have different views on what 's essential when it comes to festival camping			0
' women seem to make the sensible stuff as a priority , but men appear to focus on the good times ! ' ' it would suggest that there 's more of a cavalier attitude amongst the men surveyed			2
maybe it 's pre-festival exuberance or post-festival nostalgia , but it would be interesting to see if the list changes two days in ! got @entity149 ? try not to think about the music and the laughter , and instead focus on the money you 'll be saving ( we know , we know , it 's hard ) @entity156 wipes 72 % dry shampoo 58 % @entity158 boots 55 % antibacterial hand gel 53 % toilet roll 51 % perfume 47 % umbrella 41 % a mirror 38 % @entity163 lotion 36 % @entity164 / poncho 35 % alcohol 61 % funny fancy dress 53 % snacks 51 % protection 47 % drinking games 45 % outdoor games 42 % @entity170 39 % water 38 % @entity158 boots 37 % @entity156 wipes 35 % just one day in and the @entity19 site is already filling up with people and the inevitably enormous amounts of rubbish			1

men pack ' to have a good time ' , women pack ' to be comfortable '
women focus on buying *toiletries* , men on drinking games
average pre-festival spend , including tent , is £ 230
@entity19 is taking place in @entity9 this weekend , tickets were £ 210
