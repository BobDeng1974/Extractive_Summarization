' we are so close we could do this but you know someone would need to jump , hold his arms down and then i would stab him in the jugular , ' he said			2

' for the first time , the rantings of @entity2 siege gunman @entity62 can be heard from inside the @entity65 cafe , as hostages were forced to make phone calls to media outlets making demands			1
@entity3 can be clearly heard during the @entity71 siege special , in the background of their conversations , making almost incomprehensible statements : ' you , you call her she 's ringing some of the politicians now			1
' ' very good that everyone know , because everyone today realise that politic they all lie and they all cheat but before today they did n't know about it , ' he continues			2
' most of you they thought different			2
in his comments , the gunman focuses on politicians claiming ' they all lie and cheat ' during the @entity103 program presented by @entity104 , pregnant cafe worker @entity101 spoke about the gunman 's bizarre behaviour			1

but i will remember those teeth			2
' ms @entity101 spoke about what she thought would be last desperate conversation , about her unborn child , with partner @entity118 , who was waiting outside in @entity119 , powerless to help			1

@entity118 had raced to the scene from a work site and watched on , helpless			1
@entity65 cafe worker @entity101 told @entity104 on 60 minutes that she thought a mass execution was about to take place when they were all up against the windows			1
' i thought i was gone ' and recalls her secret phone conversation with partner @entity118 @entity101 and her partner @entity118 with the ultrasound in the weeks before the @entity65 cafe siege she also made the startling revelation that she prepared herself to be shot in the back in a mass execution inside the @entity65 cafe			1
@entity149 , thought the moment gunman @entity62 forced all hostages up against the shop windows , was @entity153			1
' i heard him - i heard a velcro opening			0
i literally thought that he was going to shoot us			0
so everybody can see through the window , i thought i was gone , ' she said			0
' and i knew my family would be watching			0
' pregnant 30 - year - old @entity101 , has spoken of how she made a secret phone call to her partner @entity118 who rushed to @entity119 when he found out she was trapped inside the @entity65 cafe			1

@entity177 , the @entity65 cafe barista who was pregnant at the time of the siege , revealed how she made peace with herself when she thought she was going to be shot by @entity3 in the early hours of the morning			1
' knowing that you ’re about to die is kind of hard , the desperation you feel , the fear , you lose hope , thinking about your family outside , thinking there ’s nothing you can do to get yourself out and it ’s very hard			0
' i remember sitting down and i thought i had a sense of calm			0
i started to be grateful for my family , for my partner and my friends and the fact that i know that maybe i wo n’t be able to have this baby			2
' i was very grateful that i was able to experience the pure love and happiness of being pregnant so at that time i remember thinking if he shoots me , as long as i do n’t feel it or see it coming i ’d be okay with it			2
@entity8 and @entity101 were among those who were able to escape the clutches of @entity62 from inside the @entity168 at the height of the @entity2 siege the anguish of the moment @entity8 decided to make a run for it , takes its toll @entity101 runs from the @entity65 cafe as the siege reached its early morning climax on december 16 as more and more people escaped , the remaining hostages recalled their fear , convinced that the gunman would turn on them in revenge as promised			1
' if someone else leaves , someone dies , ' café worker @entity172 recalled @entity3 saying			2
' they had left us			0
' a glass or something just smashed and made this big bang and the gunman , he yells ... " what was that ? ! " and then everything just slows down , ' @entity8 recalled			2
' i did n't think i was coming out			0
knowing that you 're about to die is kind of hard , the desperation you feel , the fear			0
and without even thinking i just ran , ' ms @entity101 ( far left ) said @entity174 revealed that she faced the brunt of the gunman 's rage when he realised hostages had escaped earlier in the siege			1
' he pressed me against the storage room side door			0
and i said " please , brother			0
please do n't shoot me please , please do n't shoot " , ' the 43 - year - old said he recalled when his manager @entity246 first told him to go get the keys to shut the front door			0
' well , generally when someone says , " everything is ok , " " tell the staff that we 're not in danger , " pretty much usually means that you 're in a lot of danger			0
' yet , despite being aware of endless opportunities to escape , the 19 - year - old refused to budge until the very end			0
@entity175 , 52 , who was at the café with her elderly mother @entity261 , prepared to pay for the escaped hostages with her life			1
neither woman had the option to escape due to restricted mobility - @entity175 suffers from multiple sclerosis and her 72 - year - old mother doubted she could run at great speed			0
