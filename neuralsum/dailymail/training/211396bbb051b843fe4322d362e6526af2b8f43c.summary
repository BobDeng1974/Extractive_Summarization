future astronauts on @entity1 will need to have green fingers if they 're going to survive			2
a @entity4 - led group is planning to grow lettuce on the red planet in the hope it will help feed a future colony			2
if its plans are accepted , lettuce could be sent to hostile planet as soon as 2018 , as part of the @entity14 mission to establish a human settlement there in 2025			1
astronauts on @entity1 will need to have green fingers if they 're going to survive			2
a @entity4 - led group is planning to grow lettuce on the red planet in the hopes it will help feed a future colony ( artist 's impression pictured ) on @entity1 , temperatures drop to -90 ° c at night , huge dust storms cover the entire planet for weeks , and wind speeds can reach 60mph ( 30 metres per second )			1
it sounds like a tough environment for any human to survive in , let alone other living creatures such as plants			0
but the project , being run at the @entity37 , aims to nurture the salad vegetable in a greenhouse , which would protect it from these harsh conditions			2
project leader @entity42 said : ' to live on other planets we need to grow food there			0
no - one has ever actually done this and we intend to be the first			0
to boldy grow : the project , being run by students ( pictured ) at the @entity37 , aims to nurture the salad vegetable in a greenhouse which will use the atmosphere and sunlight to help it grow most of the time , @entity1 is clear , dry , cold , and clear			1
clouds are very small , wispy and formed by carbon dioxide ice			1
it never rains on @entity1 because the planet has a thin atmosphere and lacks a magnetic shield , the the one that cover @entity63			1
temperatures at the equator during the day can be as warm as 20 ° @entity67 but at night , temperatures drop to -90 ° @entity67 this dramatic difference in temperature can create huge dust storms that can cover the entire planet for weeks			0
the maximum wind speeds on @entity1 recorded by the @entity73 in the 1970 's were about 30 meters per second ( 60 mph ) with an average of 10 m / s ( 20 mph )			2
' this plan is both technically feasible and incredibly ambitious in its scope , for we will be bringing the first complex life to another planet			0
' for the project , called # @entity81 , the greenhouse would be launched from @entity63 with lettuce seeds , water , nutrients , and systems for atmospheric processing and electronic monitoring			1
on the way to @entity1 , it would be powered down and inactive , during which time the lettuce seeds will be frozen			1
following a safe landing , the @entity14 lander will start to supply power and heating elements to maintain a temperature between 21 ° c to 24 ° @entity67 carbon dioxide , which is essential for plant life , would be extracted from the @entity1 atmosphere and processed before entering the growth chamber			1
the lettuce would then be grown without soil , and would be regularly sprayed with water and nutrients			1
once the environment had reached suitable conditions , the plant would start growing			0
food for thought : the lettuce could be sent to hostile planet as soon as 2018 , as part of the @entity14 mission to establish a human settlement there in 2025			2
pictured is an artist 's concept of a potential colony on @entity1 the aim is then for photos of the lettuce to be transmitted to @entity63 , so the public and scientists would be able to watch the lettuce mature from seed to full plant			1
once the mission is completed , the heaters would switch to full power , exterminating all life in the payload			0
the plan is one of 10 short - listed university projects , and the only one from the @entity4 , to be selected for potential inclusion in the payload for the @entity14 landing in 2018			1
other entries include @entity140 , a @entity142 project aiming to change a small amount of the 95 per cent carbon dioxide @entity1 atmosphere into oxygen using cyanobacteria			1
a contraption designed to generate the first breathable air on @entity1 has also reached the finals of a global competition to land experiments on the red planet			0
@entity142 researchers are currently testing a greenhouse system , which uses recycled urine to manufacture fertiliser			0
they hope a similar greenhouse could one day be used in space to grow vegetables students in @entity162 are n't the only ones focusing on getting lettuce to @entity1			1
@entity142 researchers are currently testing a greenhouse system , which uses recycled urine to manufacture fertiliser			0
they hope to build a complete greenhouse in @entity168 to test the first space garden in 2016			0
the system is being developed at the @entity171 in @entity172 , and is called @entity173 ( @entity174 and @entity176 - closed nutrition sources )			0
funded by the @entity178 , the greenhouses will contain combined life - support systems which use recycled urine to manufacture fertiliser , helping to grow vegetables for a lunar and @entity1 environment			2
scientist from @entity185 are also hoping to use meteorite soil to grow everything from asparagus to potatoes			0
if the study proves successful , it could help humans grow their own food in space , helping in the quest to colonise other planets .			0

plan has been proposed by group of students at @entity37
greenhouse would be launched from @entity63 with lettuce seeds , water , nutrients , and systems for atmospheric processing and monitoring
following landing , @entity14 will keep greenhouse between 21 ° c to 24 ° c
carbon dioxide would then be extracted from the @entity1 atmosphere
lettuce would be grown without soil and regularly sprayed with water
plan is one of 10 *shortlisted* projects to be selected for potential inclusion in the payload for the @entity14 landing in 2018
