by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter @entity4 ’s parents are to apply under @entity6 law to become private ‘ prosecutors ’ in the reopened criminal inquiry into her disappearance			1
if @entity12 and @entity13 are granted the status of ‘ assistentes ’ , their legal team could work alongside state prosecutors so they are kept informed of all new developments and conduct their own private prosecution – running parallel to the state prosecution – against any future suspects			1
it ’s a distant cry from the days in 2007 when @entity6 police labelled the couple with ‘ arguido ’ – or suspect – status			1
under the country ’s legal system , ‘ there is a place for the victims that want to be side by side with the prosecutors ’ , said the @entity29 ’ @entity6 lawyer , @entity28			1
‘ they can press their own charges			0
’ hopeful : @entity13 and @entity42 's fight for justice after the disappearance of their daughter @entity45 is fuelled by the hope that she is alive , their @entity6 lawyer claims @entity6 ’s attorney general confirmed on thursday that the probe was being reopened at the request of police based in @entity53 who have spent the last two and a half years reviewing the case			1
the @entity29 ’ @entity6 lawyer , @entity28 , said local police have finally admitted to the couple they no longer regard them as suspects , more than five years after the original investigation was shelved			1
the couple were told in a police briefing last week in @entity64 , new lines of inquiry which have led to the reopening of the investigation in @entity6 , absolve them of any responsibility			1
mr @entity28 said : ' the @entity29 were already informed about the reopening of the inquiry and the reasons why it was being reopened			2
' they also know that this new line of inquiry excludes any responsibility of the parents			0
' the @entity6 police told them this at a meeting in @entity64 last week at which @entity80 police were also present			1
access all areas : the @entity29 will apply for prosecutor status in the reopened criminal inquiry into @entity85 's disappearance ( pictured right on the day she vanished ) allowing them to be kept informed of all new developments in the case ' what it means is that the police understand there are new avenues that should be explored			1
' this brings @entity45 ’s parents a legitimate expectation not only that the truth will be discovered but also that it will be possible to find @entity45 alive which is the sole aim of all the efforts they ’ve been making			1
' @entity6 ’s current attorney general , @entity100 , is the first woman ever appointed to the post			2
an e-fit image released by the @entity103 this month of a man they want to investigate as @entity6 authorities reopen the case with new inquiries she took over as the country ’s top legal advisor in october 2012 from predecessor @entity112 after his six - year mandate came to an end			1
it was still unclear last night which police force would be appointed to lead the reopened inquiry			0
initial reports suggested it would be a team of @entity122 - based @entity121 detectives but today it appeared more likely the review team from @entity53 would be asked to do the job			0
the detectives will work under the direction of public prosecutors based in the @entity122 resort of @entity129			0
@entity130 , the public prosecutor in charge of the original investigation , is expected to oversee the reopened inquiry			0
he was damning of the original probe pointing the finger at @entity45 ’s parents and claimed officers under disgraced @entity137 achieved ' very little ' during their 15 - month investigation			2
he also thwarted attempts by mr @entity137 to charge the @entity29 with child abandonment , leading to a souring in relations between police and prosecutors			2
mr @entity137 went on to write a controversial book called ‘ @entity146 ’ which the @entity29 are currently suing him over at an ongoing civil trial in a @entity64 court because of his claims they faked their daughter ’s abduction to cover up her death in their holiday apartment			1
it also emerged last night @entity45 ’s parents are set to apply to become private prosecutors - ‘ assistentes ’ under @entity6 law - in the reopened criminal inquiry			1
it will mean their legal team can work alongside state prosecutors so they are kept informed of all new developments and conduct their own private prosecution - running parallel to the state prosecution - against any future suspects charged over @entity45 ’s disappearance			1
can press their own charges : the @entity29 ( pictured in 2007 after @entity85 's disappearance ) will be able to be in court with their lawyer if they are granted prosecutor status once the secrecy order is lifted it marks a remarkable turnaround in a case in which they were once ' arguidos ' or suspects			1
their status as ‘ assistentes ’ would be crucial because of the secrecy order slapped on the case by @entity6 ’s attorney general			1
they would n’t have access to all case files at present because of the secrecy order as ‘ assistentes ’ - but would once the secrecy order is lifted			0
mr @entity28 said today : ' i will be applying for the @entity29 to become assistentes in this case but do n’t know yet when			2
' @entity45 is the victim as well as her parents who are also her legal representatives			2
' according to @entity6 criminal procedural law there is a place for the victims that want to be side by side with the prosecutors			2
' it ’s a question of them helping the prosecutor deliver to the case files all the information they have that can assist the investigation			0
disappearance : the @entity208 resort in @entity209 where @entity4 disappeared from in may 2007 ' they can submit an accusation , they can press their own charges			0
' at the trial , if there is a trial , they can be in court with their own lawyer , asking their own questions			0
' it ’s a sort of a private accusation to help the state prosecution			0
” he added : ' the secrecy order that ’s been placed on this case prevents me from saying what the new lines of inquiry are			0
' the police asked us specifically not to compromise the investigation and we are all obliged to respect the secrecy order			0
' it would be a crime for anyone working within the file with full information on the details to talk about it			0
we do n’t have the full details , we just have an idea			0
' @entity45 ’s parents are the ones with most interest in abiding by the secrecy order and maintaining the efficiency of the investigation			2
but i can say that the information they got from the @entity253 police directly is that the new lines of investigation absolve them of any responsibility in their daughter ’s disappearance			0

the @entity29 ' lawyer claims @entity6 police have finally admitted that the parents are no longer suspects
the couple will apply for prosecutor status allowing them to be *updated* of new developments in the case
@entity45 was snatched in 2007 from family 's holiday apartment
@entity6 police have *re-opened* case five years after it was *closed*
