by @entity0 published : 19:41 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 19:42 est , 10 march 2014 families with stay - at - home mothers in @entity5 face a higher tax burden than those in the rest of the western world , a study has found			1
a one - earner family on the average wage that tries to raise their income through longer working hours or promotion will pay extra taxes at more than double the rate of those in other developed countries			2
according to the analysis by tax experts at the charity care , a family here living on a single salary of £ 27,000 can keep only 27p of every pound that they earn above that			0
penalised : tax experts at @entity24 have said that the system is unfair on mothers who do not work they lose 73p through income tax and national insurance as well as the loss of tax credits , which are taken away as families earn more			0
an average one - earner family on £ 27,000 across the @entity38 ( a club of the world ’s 34 richest countries ) , would keep 66p of every extra pound earned			1
the charity said the discrepancy is an unfair penalty on families with stay - at - home mothers here			1
it comes at a time of growing protest from pressure groups speaking up for mothers who choose to bring up their children rather than pursue careers			0
ministers continue to press for mothers of young children to return to work , and hope to encourage them further with new childcare subsidies next year			0
protests : many pressure groups have begun to speak up at women who would rather raise their children than pursue careers however , a @entity63 survey in january showed that more than a third of working mothers would prefer to give up their jobs and stay at home , while almost six out of ten would cut down their hours to spend more time at home if they could afford it			0
the @entity24 report – @entity74 , @entity75 – said there was ‘ discrimination against one - earner families on the average wage			1
' this discrimination creates a significant tax burden gap between one - earner and dual - earner couple families that is greater than in the @entity38 or the @entity83 ’			1
a one - earner family in @entity5 pays 80 per cent of the tax a single person must pay , compared to 55 per cent across the @entity38			2
and the report said the problem was getting worse – the extra taxes have gone up by 6 per cent for one - earner families compared to single people since 2011			2
@entity24 chief executive @entity91 said : ‘ it is scandalous that we get agitated about 50 per cent tax rates for the rich when we are in fact placing the highest effective marginal tax rates on low to modest income one - earner families seeking to improve their circumstances			1
’ a tax break for married couples is to be introduced next year , which will allow a husband or wife to transfer £ 1,000 of tax - free allowance to their spouse			0
however , it will only be worth £ 200 to the less well - off .			0

study shows that one - earner families find it harder to bring in extra income
the charity @entity24 said the tax burden is more than twice as large
the @entity5 was compared to *33* of the world *'s* richest other countries , which treat families which *include* stay - at - home mothers more *generously*
