students preparing for college campus tours can now make the task easier by hopping on a private jet and visiting schools - but it will cost $ 43,500			2
the price is nearly the same as the $ 43,938 undergraduate tuition at @entity8 ( that 's not including room and board )			0
the ten - hour flight cards offered by @entity13 , a company that provides private travel services , also include perks like car services to transport clients to and from each campus			1
in its second year of running the offer , the company said last year 18 people purchased the cards , and each made around three or four college visits in one day			1
families can pay $ 43,500 to have a private jet help their college hopeful make multiple college visits into a short period of time ( above file photo ) this year , they are expecting 50 buyers of the package , which is offered from march 25 - june 30 , a @entity13 spokeswoman told @entity34			1
' there is a little bit of a misconception with private jets that it 's all glitz and glamour , but the real reason people use them is productivity and efficiency , ' @entity35 , vice president at @entity13 told @entity46			0
' this is a tool that our clients use in order to be more efficient			0
i know that might sound weird , but that 's really why they 're using it			0
' while data from last year revealed that over the past three decades the average tuition at a public four - year college had more than tripled , most families are likely looking at financial aid options before considering splurging on a chartered jet to visit campuses			1
but for those who can afford to dish out the money , @entity64 said its college tour service was created as a way to help alleviate the stress that often comes with campus visits , according to @entity72			0
@entity35 said the idea came from clients who were already using their services for college tours so they just met the demand			2
last year , he told @entity78 that through the service , a student can visit up to eight campuses in different cities in one weekend			1
he said they were able to take one student to visit @entity85 , @entity86 , and @entity87 in one day			1
this year they have already taken a few clients on tours			0
@entity35 , a vice president at @entity13 , said there is a misconception with private jets being all ' glitz and glamour ' but that the real reason people use them is for efficiency ( above students on a college tour at @entity102 ) the company organizes a flight schedule based on the schools a client wants to visit , then sets up the car services , while some times even coordinating private tours of college towns with local chauffeurs			1
if a family using the service can not fit in all of the schools they wanted to visit using the ten - hour card , they have to purchase additional cards			1
following each visit , their client is given a notepad from each college they toured so they can write their feedback			2
@entity13 puts together all of the notes and sums up their client 's reaction from each school			2
and once the college hopeful chooses a school , they receive a gift basket from the company filled with branded items from the institution			0
@entity137 , co-founder of @entity138 , which offers a $ 16,000 four - day course for students to complete their college applications , said she is surprised there are not more concierge - style college visiting services			2
she told @entity46 : ' it 's clunky to visit schools			0
there should be a hotel / private plane / car service that 's all connected			0

@entity13 offers ten - hour flight cards for clients to go on college visits while also offering car services
*previously* , company said a student can visit up to eight campuses in different cities during one weekend
last year , a client visited @entity85 , @entity86 , and @entity87 in one day
