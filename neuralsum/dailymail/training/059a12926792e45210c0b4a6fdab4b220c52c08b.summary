but 32 - year - old @entity0 , who is yet to feature for @entity17 ' side this season , found criticism from the former @entity21 right - back and @entity15 pundit excessive , especially considering he has no experience of playing between the sticks			1
@entity0 , ( second left ) pictured in pre-season training with fellow @entity1 keeper @entity4 @entity4 was singled out by @entity3 after @entity1 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity28 rivals @entity12 he told the @entity29 : ' i 've never seen @entity3 play in goal but he seemed to have a good opinion of it			1
' everyone has an opinion			2
what we work on in training is very match - specific and match - related			0
it 's just one of those things and there are too many opinions knocking about nowadays			2
' there are not too many people who speak highly of goalkeepers			0
they tend to want to put them down			0
' @entity4 , 26 , has been unable to replicate the kind of form he showed last season , managing only one clean sheet in 10 league and cup games for the club so far this campaign			2
however , @entity0 has backed the @entity10 to return to his best as @entity1 look to get back on track after a frustrating start to the season			1
@entity4 coulod n't stop the ball crossing the line as @entity63 scores @entity66 's @entity65 winner free agent @entity6 has been heavily linked with a move to @entity1 since leaving @entity68 he added : ' he is strong minded enough to get on with his job and understand what happens			1
it is a shame that it happens because last season he produced some massive saves that helped us win games and people tend to forget them			0
' then the press jump on it and want to criticise him and say someone else is coming into the club and this and that			0
' it is important to let him get on with his job and to continue doing the things he was doing last season			0
