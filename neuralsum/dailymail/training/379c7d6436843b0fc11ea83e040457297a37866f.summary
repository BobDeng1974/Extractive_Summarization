the revelation is one of several new disclosures from a cold case review that will fuel speculation the 35 - year - old chef could have been seeing a secret boyfriend in the weeks before she vanished five years ago today			1
using techniques not available in 2009 , police found the potentially vital dna profile on a discarded @entity24 cigarette butt			1
it was found in the ashtray of her @entity27 , which was being repaired when she went missing			0
they want to find out if the evidence from the car , which had been off the road ‘ for a number of weeks ’ when she vanished , is linked to a man who has been dubbed the ' left - handed smoker '			1
the man was seen standing with a woman at 5.35am on the day miss @entity39 disappeared , at a point on her route to work and at an appropriate time			1
the couple were seen by a passing cyclist and were facing each other several feet apart on @entity46			0
the man , dressed in a dark hooded top , was smoking from a cigarette held in his left hand			1
miss @entity39 was ‘ comfortable ’ with people smoking in her car and home , police said , and officers have been checking the dna of male smokers known to have sat in her vehicle without finding a match			1
police also want to trace a man who told shop workers he knew miss @entity39 or used to work with her , but has never been traced			1
the man , identified on @entity63 , mentioned the case to staff in @entity65 , @entity66 , on april 1 , 2009 - almost two weeks after she disappeared			1
the charity @entity68 today renewed a £ 10,000 reward for any information which leads to the arrest and conviction of someone responsible for miss @entity39 's disappearance			1

he was never traced analysis of miss @entity39 's phone records indicate she was spending an unusual amount of time ‘ socialising ’ in the @entity95 suburb of @entity66 during this period and police believe somebody she was seeing there is ‘ yet to come forward			1
’ evidence inside miss @entity39 ’s house indicates she left as normal early in the morning of thursday 19 march to walk the three miles to work at the @entity103 ’s @entity102 for a 6am shift			0
another more curious item police want to trace is miss @entity39 ’s set of @entity108 hair straighteners			2
detective superintendent @entity109 , who is leading the review , said officers had spent two months examining her terraced house			2
he said : ' from the review of all the evidence available , including the fact that @entity90 's bed was made and it appears that she had eaten breakfast and brushed her teeth , it is our belief that she had left for work on the morning of thursday 19 march 2009			0
' what is unusual is that @entity90 's @entity108 hair straighteners - model number @entity124 and purchased in may 2007 - were missing from her home			0
police are investigating how and why miss @entity39 's @entity108 hair straighteners could have disappeared @entity130 , right , the father of @entity90 , left , described the uncertainty surrounding the case as ' a cancer ' ' from our inquiries , it is doubtful that she would take them to work in her blue and grey @entity139 bag which has also never been found			1
' mr @entity109 said extra fingerprints and dna material were found throughout the house and work on this was ‘ ongoing			2
’ he added : ‘ we are keen to eliminate people who have been inside @entity90 ’s home before and after her disappearance			2

det @entity179 added : ‘ there is a possibility that @entity90 may also have been colouring another person 's hair			0
if anyone knows about this or it was you , please come forward now			2
’ the high - profile police inquiry has always focused on miss @entity39 ’s private life and her parents have been upset by reports about her lovers			2

she also went out with a different mystery man 48 hours before she vanished			2
miss @entity39 arrived for her early shift looking tired and told a work colleague she had been out until 4 or 5am with a boyfriend			0
miss @entity39 was a prolific user of her mobile phone and further ‘ cell site activity ’ analysis showed she was often in @entity95 during her spare time in the weeks before she disappeared			0
although known to drink in a pub there , police believe there could be vital information about this aspect of her social life that they have not been told about			1

he said it was ‘ doubtful ’ she would take the straighteners to work but they ‘ could be crucial to the investigation			0
’ his colleague chief superintendent @entity258 told a press conference there is ‘ not a prime suspect and nor is there any individual who could be deemed to be classified as suspect status			0
’ but he added : ‘ there are a number of individuals who remain and are of particular interest to this investigation			0
’ speaking earlier @entity130 , the missing woman ’s father , said waiting five years for news was ‘ like a cancer			0
’ ‘ it gets worse and worse and of course there is no resolution until we know what happened to @entity90			0
