by @entity0 suppressed : transport secretary @entity1 told @entity2 it is ' not in the public interest ' to publish the official report that labelled @entity6 in danger of failing a key report into whether the @entity6 rail line would give value for money is being kept secret by the government			1
transport secretary @entity1 told @entity2 he is using emergency powers to veto publication of the report that says @entity6 is in danger of failing			1
he said that protecting the impartiality of civil servants ’ secret advice to ministers has to take priority over disclosure to the public			1
but @entity6 protesters branded the gagging order an ‘ absolutely ­ disgraceful ’ delaying tactic			1
campaigners against the £ 50billion high - speed line between @entity28 , the @entity29 and the @entity30 demanded publication of the @entity32 and its cost - benefit analysis under freedom of information laws			1
@entity35 , of the @entity6 ­ campaign , said yesterday ’s decision was ‘ absolutely disgraceful ’ and a @entity11 cover - up			1
he said : ‘ this veto has only been used a handful of times , including the blocking of publication of @entity45 discussions on the @entity46 , the @entity48 risk register and ­ letters from prince @entity50 to @entity45 members			0
this is the first time the veto has been used in relation to a ruling made by the information commissioner on environmental grounds			0
‘ this just proves that there has been , and continues to be an agenda from @entity11 to deceive mps and the public with spin and dismiss any independent information showing just how bad the @entity6 project is			1
‘ all they want is to make sure this report stays buried for a little longer so they can con @entity60 into voting for their white elephant vanity project			2
’ the information commissioner , rejecting ministers ’ objections , ordered them to release the report			2
but now that has been overruled by the @entity11 veto			0
in a written statement to mps , mr @entity1 said : ‘ the assurance of confidentiality is important in the conduct of the review			0
in my view , there is nothing in the nature or ­ content of this particular report which outweighs that strong public interest against disclosure			2
’ high speed : the report about the proposed train line the warned there was a ' red or red / amber ' risk of the project failing mr @entity1 said he had given the information commissioner a ‘ certificate ’ under section 53 of the @entity99			1
this overrides the commissioner ’s decision to force the government to reveal the @entity106 report			1
he said : ‘ my decision to exercise this power of veto in this case was not taken lightly , ’ adding that he decided it was an ­ ‘ exceptional case ’			0
information commissioner ­ @entity113 said : ‘ this is a disappointing decision and i ’ll be studying the secretary of state ’s explanation to understand why this has been ruled an exceptional case			2
‘ there are important legal issues to be considered here , and i ’ll be ­ highlighting our view of them in an open letter to the @entity126 in due course			2
’ the report , which included a cost - benefit analysis of the scheme , was given to ministers in november 2011 but never made public			2
it is understood to warn of a risky timetable for @entity6 , poor management , low delivery confidence and suggestions that the success of the scheme is in doubt			1
it says that at the @entity142 and @entity143 there are ‘ concerns over skills , capability and resources ’ , with too few people ­ working on the project and many of those lacking sufficient skills			0
last november , the government published its strategic case document , painting a rosy case for @entity6 including an upbeat benefit - cost ratio			1
@entity155 of @entity156 said unveiling the report is in the ­ public interest			0
‘ the proposed £ 50billion project will blight 500,000 homes – only 2 per cent of whose owners will receive compensation – and which will generate massive environmental damage , ’ he said			0
‘ so far as we can see , the last time secrecy laws of this nature were invoked was during the @entity170 war			0
’ @entity175 protester dr @entity172 , who brought the @entity99 request , said : ‘ this is a delaying tactic on the part of ­ @entity11 as they know the decision is likely to go to judicial review			0
‘ this should not be necessary as @entity2 should be scrutinising this arbitrary decision and ensuring that it is overturned , as it creates an alarming precedent			0
’ but a @entity11 spokesman said : ‘ it ’s important to strike a balance between the benefits of transparency and protecting the ability of officials to “ speak truth to power ”			0
‘ @entity195 will not be truly effective if officials fear that their frank advice to ministers could be disclosed			0
the government has decided that it is not in the public interest to release this report			1

transport secretary used emergency legal powers to block report
government needed to ' protect the impartiality of civil service advice '
@entity6 will link @entity28 and @entity212 with new *240mph* train line
