@entity0 knows a thing or two about stability – he has been at the heart of the @entity5 ’s defence for 13 years and is set to win his 100th cap against world champions @entity8			1
but it is at club level where he is enjoying the settled surrounds of @entity13 manager @entity12 , who replaced firebrand @entity14 exactly one year ago			1
@entity0 , like many of the squad , fell out with the @entity17 before his inevitable dismissal			0
under @entity12 , however , the 33 - year - old is captain and a certain starter			1
@entity21 is preparing top make his 100th appearance for @entity5 , he would be the sixth @entity23 to do so the @entity13 have lost just once in the @entity24 this season and , after last year ’s narrow escape from relegation , @entity0 is enjoying @entity12 ’s calming influence			1
‘ it is much more stable now and the club needed that , ’ said the former @entity30 centre back			2
‘ the manager showed at @entity35 that he knows what he is doing and the attitude of the gaffer and his staff is amazing			0
the @entity13 captain praised the calming influence of @entity12 after @entity14 's tempestuous tenure ‘ they want the players to go on and improve and build themselves up individually and as a team			1
hopefully we are doing that			0
the manager has built up a tight - knit squad			0
’ @entity0 will earn his 99th international cap against @entity49 during saturday ’s @entity51 qualifier before his milestone match in @entity53 on tuesday			2
it is , though , a point of regret that only three of his caps have come at a major tournament , the @entity59 in 2012 when @entity5 crashed out at the group stage			2
‘ statistics are there and they mean a lot but ultimately you want to be out there winning games , ’ he said			0
the former @entity30 defender trains with the @entity13 players at @entity69 ‘ i have only been to one major tournament with @entity5 so to get to the @entity72 finals with my country would be very special			1
that ’s what i ’m focussing on			0
it will be a big thing for the future of the young ones coming through as well , so we have got to try and get there			0
’ of his potential landmark , he added : ‘ my 100th cap could come against the world champions , so that ’s a nice game for it to happen			1
i ’d only be the sixth @entity23 to do it as well			2
‘ it will be something i will look back on more when i have finished in the game and not playing			0
it will be special at the time for my family , friends , old clubs and a very proud moment			0
’ the only international tournament @entity21 played in with @entity5 was the @entity59 in 2012			1

@entity21 could win 100th cap for @entity5 against @entity8
@entity13 captain @entity21 praised @entity12 's calming influence
@entity21 said @entity13 needed stability after the *volatile* @entity14
